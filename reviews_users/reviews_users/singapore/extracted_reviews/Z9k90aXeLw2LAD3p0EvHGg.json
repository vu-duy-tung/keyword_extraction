I used to doubt Mouth Restaurant on the quality of their food having had a bad episode many many moons before. Well. This visit changed my mind. Giving them a thumbs up!I was looking for a place for a New Year's Eve gathering with some friends and was browsing through Fav. Their 6 course set meal costing S$38 with Boston Lobster, Birds Nest and Abalone caught my eye. So I bought the vouchers and was still wondering if it will be good. I went there and was greeted by friendly and efficient servers. The food serving was good and the flavouring and presentation done right. For a moment I thought I was having some cuisines in a high end restaurant. The servers were also helpful when I wanted to order additional food stuffs as they knew we were having a 6 course lunch. Plates were changed frequently and when you are done with your plate, they immediately ask if they could help to clear the table. All these really made the experience feel great and made the meal even more enjoyable!I have made mistakes about my previous experience with them. I will come back for more!",

Very prompt service, the waitering staff will keep a look out if you need to refill your pot of tea and do not hesitate to change your plates when they deem necessary. This kind of service really impresses me and makes a great dining experience.",

    "text": "Mouth Restaurant was first established in the 80s in Chinatown Point and is known for its well made Cantonese Dim Sum. The tea house, which originally served delicate pieces of steamed dumplings, has gone on to provide more cooked dishes at its current China Square Central and Plaza Singapura outlets in Singapore.We went in search of some Salted Egg Yolk Custard buns, which Mouth Restaurant is famous for. Managed to snag a table for dim sum on Saturday noon. We were lucky to get a table despite the last minute reservation.Century Egg and Shredded Pork Porridge is one of my standard dimsum order. Nice gluey texture of the congee with generous amount of pork. 4 of us shared a portion in order to make space for more food.Shanghai Xiao Long Bao, Har Gao (Steamed Prawn Dumplings), and Spare Ribs in garlic and chili. All great dishes. The Xiao Long Bao skin was sufficiently thin and encased the juicy pork meat in a robust broth. Har Gao was big, fresh and juicy (i can never resist prawns). The ribs were well marinated and flavorful as well. Mouth Restaurant also offers Colored Har Gao instead of the typical Colored Xiao Long Bao and they are Squid Ink, Spinach, Sweet Potato, Pumpkin, Carrot and Original. The Pan Fried Carrot Cake (another of my favorite dim sum item) was nicely browned and lightly crisp on the outside. The springy texture is just what i look for in a good carrot cake. Oh and the delicious strips of turnip and preserved Chinese sausages (lup cheong) had me finish most of this myself.The Steamed Rice Roll with Fresh Prawn aka Cheong Fun was alright. It's not that they weren't good, the skin was silky but perhaps thicker than what i prefer. Prawns were great as usual but the sauce was a little bland in my opinion. Now now, the reason why we went to Mouth Restaurant. Here's the baked Salted Egg Yolk Bun (3pcs per set) Mind you, they run out fast. Just look at that lovely Hong Kong Bo Lo crust made from sugar, butter and milk powder. It's hard to believe that this is baked because the crust is so crunchy.Be careful how you bite into the bun. Be warned that the piping viscous, creamy, savory and sweet lava may just erupt in your mouth and potentially over your plate, and shirt, and your fellow diners' shirts. It may be a little on the greasy end but the flavor was spot on.Head on to Mouth Restaurant for a classic dim sum fix this weekend! Forgot the prices but it was about S$75 for 4 pax.",

But 6 colors don't taste differently at all. I had 6 colors Xiao long Bao and they actually tastes very different each one. Their stir fried broccoli is tasty but other items are pretty general to me.",

    "text": "Mouth Restaurant has revamped their menu since last year and the new items are reinterpretations of traditional dim sum. The Family went to its newly opened branch at Plaza Singapura during a weekend high tea session from 3-5pm but sadly, many items like the squid ink bun and their signature Xiao long Bao were not available. The Rainbow Har Gao in 6 ($9.80) \u00a0mimics the concept of multi-flavor Xiao long was not distinctive as its pork counterpart in XLB. Do not mistaken this Squid Ink Seafood Soup 7.80 for herbal jelly. The base is a egg white custard, topped with a thick soup that is rich and tasty.The best thing I can remember is their Baked salted Egg Yolk (3 for $5) Unlike typical steamed bun, the mildly sweetened outer crust is crisp like a HK-style Bo Lo Bun, that released viscous and creamy golden lava. Though some might find it to be much more greasy than usual kind, but who will say no to custard buns?:)The Sweet Potato Roll $3.60 and Tako Cheese Croquette $4.80 sounded special but turned out to be dry, starchy and pedestrian. Some of the mandatory dimsum items included the chicken claws w chilli $3.90 and the Spare ribs with pumpkin $4.50 and the Fried Beancurd skin roll $ 3.20. \u00a0Instead of the usual Chee cheong fun, we ordered the XO-style Pan Fried version Bao. The skin was of the right thickness but the individual flavor of shrimp meat with prawn and charshu $8.80. It turned out to resemble stir-fried kway teow. I like the slightly browned surface of the rice rolls that makes this dish fragrant but the taste of XO-sauce was not amplified. \u00a0Conclusion: Higher chances of securing popular dim sum items if we were to come in the morning. Would be more keen to revisit for their revamped ala carte dishes, which were in our memories, more delicious than the dim sum. Some items are creative but their quality vary. Hopefully my favourite egg tarts that were nowhere to be found, can appear on their dimsum menu one day......",

    "text": "4 stars for their cooking, 3 stars for the dimsum.a much-lauded chinese restaurant especially known for their molten salted yolk pineapple buns (or liu sha bao, in short), this place is crowded to the rafters on a sunday afternoon - probably at least in part due to the at least average dimsum and pretty decent cooking.reservations are a defo here - you wait even if you've called ahead for a table. they aren't too concerned with you at the door and when you sit down, service is pretty harried (though efficient after you've ordered). make your dimsum orders on the slip of paper, and let the dining begin.you must get the salted yolk buns, if only just to vindicate yourself on having personally (in)invalidated the hype. the bubs are soft, the 'pineapple' (so named for its crackliness rather than flavor) topping a sweet crusty crust; that yolk filling is molten, yes, but it's a bit on the sweet side - and together with the sweet crust, makes the bun a tad too cloying and rich. well worth eating once though.I found most of the dimsum offerings pedestrian, really - though that's a far step above being completely unworth the calories (such as red star) - nothing wholly offensive or impressive. but I'm pleased to tell you their cooked dishes show more than gratifying cooking prowess. it shows skill you wouldn't have imagined with the dimsum, and more than explains the full occupancy of the place.take the spinach in broth with goji berries: very clear and refreshing and subtly-flavored. we had a little less luck with pork trotters but it might have been a problem of expectation. what came was a very sweet, very vinegary, literally black dish of trotter with very little meat. alot more skin, if you're into it - but make sure you're into this style of preparation too (I definitely am not).we were soon blown away by the sheer majesty of their sakura chicken dish: a crisp, thin-and-brown-skinned chicken full of tender meat and well-seasoned chickeny flavor - delicious, and immensely eatable.very, very delicious.I think you'd do well to come for a proper meal - I'm talking dishes with rice and that sort of thing - rather than dimsum, though that liushabao does deserve a little attention (even if not so much its oft-acclaimed position at the top of 'best liushabao' lists).reasonably priced, service you expect in an old-school chinese restaurant, and good cooking - it's old-school chinese eating. the furnishings are a little old and gaudy, and has clearly suffered from the surfeit of people coming through at mealtimes - but don't expect posh and you won't get it you'd be happy.",

    "text": "Over the years, Mouth Kitchen has become one of our favourite dim sum places to head to. Rather than the more traditional push-cart type of dim sum, you simply check off the items you want on a paper menu and hand it to the waiter. There's even a column to differentiate your first and second orders - a knowing nod to Singaporeans who love to gorge themselves on repeat orders like yours truly. I felt that the average price of $5 for each dish was justified, even the modern ambience and quality of the food. On a Sunday afternoon, the restuarant was packed - I highly recommend booking in advance. Highlights include the har gao - delicately steamed without a thick skin - as well as the pan fried carrot cake - which was not too oily and fried to the right amount of crispiness. Both the prawn and char siew chee cheong fun were also great, with just the right amount of sauce. The shui jin bao (too thick and starchy) as well as the fried chee cheong fun (just a fancy name for char kway teow) could have been better, though. We also felt that \"signature award-winning\" dishes were slightly overpriced, but what took the cake was definitely the \"liu sha bao\", or salted egg buns. These were served piping hot, and the steamed buns split open to a melted yolky centre - like liquid gold. Desserts are nothing special, though. In place of the recommended mango pudding (Crystal Jade serves better), we decided to have another round of the salted egg buns!",
