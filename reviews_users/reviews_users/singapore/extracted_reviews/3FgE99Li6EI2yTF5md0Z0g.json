    "text": "Sure the price is pretty high end for a burger, but Omakase is the closest thing to a in-n-out in U.S. My personal favourite is the bacon cheeseburger with cheese fries - \u00a0better eat them quickly though as they are only delicious while warm. Their customer service is also excellent and I have ordered Omakase delivery several times, one of which they only delivered a partial order. Not only were they prompt on fixing the mistake and delivering the rest of the order, they also threw in an extra burger. Would recommend if you are really craving a burger and are willing to pay for it!",

    "text": "More like a 3.5.I've been to Omakase Burger 3 times, though this was my maiden visit to their Wisma Atria branch. I first tried it at the Grandstand shortly after a 7-week jaunt through Hamburgerland (USA) and was suffering from In-and-Out/ShakeShack/Unami Burger withdrawal. This hit the spot, and I really loved the burger the first time I tried it. Alas, the Grandstand was so inaccesible without a car...So I was delighted to hear that they'd opened a second branch in a central location! Anyway, the story behind Omakase Burger is that an engineer spent years and years experimenting (and documenting his results on Excel sheets, because he's an engineer after all) to find the perfect burger, and this was it. The name sounds Japanese but there is nothing remotely nippon-ese about this place.Slightly pricey (I would have expected to pay somewhere in the high 10s for what I got). I had their special, a blue cheese beef burger. My burger, like everyone else's here, was WATERY. It tasted good- the blue cheese sauce was delicious and not overpowering- but halfway through I noticed that there were puddles of beefjuice on my table. I had the beef tallow fries which was rather underwhelming. Tasted like McDonalds to me. But anyway, the good thing about the dripping burger was that after I channeled the beefjuice to drip onto my fries they became DIVINE! (I shall take credit for this marvellous discovery)Anyway, ambience is pretty casual. It wasn't crowded on a Sunday night (in fact it was 2/3s empty). Good for a relaxed date night or spontaneous outing with friends!",

The bacon was ok, I could not tell the difference with American hardwood. The burger was good and made to perfection with a medium beef patty and a sweet tasting bun (I actually love the bun). While the burger looked small, it was filling and juicy. I saw the juice in the wrapper after I was done with the burger as mentioned by other Yelpers. Instead of pouring the leftover juice over the regular fries (my friend ordered that) as suggested by Steffi C, I dipped the fries in it and it was totally awesome. The sweet potato fries were really tasty too and it was a huge serving. It would make sense in future to just share the sides with friends unless you are really hungry. The root beer float with the soft serve was equally good. I liked that they gave you the remaining root beer in the can to top up the drink. The only thing I didn't like is the price. At $25-$30 for a burger, side and drink, it is a bit steep for a meal in a casual dining outfit. This is definitely not a place for regular dining.",

While I know this place is known for their burgers, I was just not happy.I strongly believe Omakase Burger is just a typical burger joint. The burgers aren't nothing to praise about, however very expensive as a self-service concept. I strongly believe artisan burgers should be distinctive and not an over priced Wendy's hamburger. That's my opinion as a Yelp user.Service: I can't complain about the service, the waiter was very nice and attentive. The food came out quick, even though they were packed. All the workers were really nice.Overall I would say you could totally skip this place and save yourself from eating overpriced mediocre tiny burger.",

Charred and flavours sealed in. Plus Plus! Unfortunately, the juiciness of the burger eventually finds its way out and your soft bun gets soggy. Minus! By the time you finish, the wrapper that you've been using to keep the bun and patty in place has enough liquid on the bottom to make this meal not so appealing. 2xMinus!Back to the plus. The Applewood Smoked Bacon was divine. And the minus. The processed American cheese which gives the melted gooeyness just doesnt have enough flavour to balance the overriding soft artisanal bun. I find their 'perfect' beef to bun ratio a bit tilted to the bun side. Maybe it's me, but I much prefer the richness of flavour from a slice of Cheddar that is cut from a block over processed cheese. And finally, the truffle fries were overcooked. In the end, this is above average with a correspondingly above average price point. But the meal is also in a quick service restaurant setting so you're done before you know it. So I continue in my quest to find the ultimate burger...",

    "text": "If you miss in-n-out burger on the west coast of the US, this is about as close as you will find in Singapore (sadly without the option of animal style)The ultimate burger has pretty much all you could ask for in a burger... Great meat, perfectly cooked bacon, grilled onions & mushrooms and a few other surprises. The bun was not amazing as some others I have had, but doesn't detract from the burger. They offer their burgers without a bun and in a lettuce wrap for the pseudo rabbits in the bunch. We went on a weekend so tried the tallow fries (only on Saturdays and Sundays). Basically fries that were cooked with meat of some sort. They taste like the great old fashion mcdonalds fries but with less salt. We also tried the cheese fries and there is something addicting about the canned cheese they use!While this is not the best burger in all of Singapore (I still think Luke's oyster and chop house is) it is very good, convent to get to and reminds you of the great fast food burgers from the US.",

    "text": "Ohhhhhhmakase burger.In a way, \"Omakase\" is a bit of a misnomer, as there are no Japanese elements in the burgers here. They just named it so because they truly want you to let the chef decide your burger. And I guess there isn't a nice English equivalent to that phrase.*After discovering that both Paradise Dynasty and Din Tai Fung had long queues for Saturday dinner**, we saw some availability at Omakase so we decided to fall into that queue instead.I ordered the Omakase Cheeseburger ($14.90), while Miguel ordered the Ultimate Cheeseburger ($18.50). We also got a small order of Beef Tallow Fries ($5.95). The Beef Tallow Fries are special because they cook it from the oil that comes from the burgers. Since it takes a while to collect enough oil to make these fries, it's only available on Saturdays and Sundays.Our first impression of the burgers were that they were really small for the prices they were charging. (For those who are familiar with Shake Shack, I would say the burgers aren't that much bigger.) Both burgers were supposed to be cooked medium; mine turned out a little overcooked and dry on one side, while Miguel's was slightly undercooked.As for the beef tallow fries, Miguel aptly noted, \"It tastes like McDonald's fries. But I do like McDonald's fries.\" Personally, I couldn't pick up any major difference in taste. Perhaps the truffle fries would've been a better bet, as I could smell them from the next table.Once I got past the dry part of my burger and hit the juiciness, I did see how it was a good burger. But given the inconsistencies, I couldn't bring myself to pay that much for a burger that could be devoured in 6-8 bites.--*I mean, \"Bossy Burger\" or \"Dictator Burger\" doesn't sound as cultured/profitable as \"Omakase\", methinks.**Husband and I are obviously Orchard n00bs.",

So juicy I actually drank up the juice left in the paper haha! This is called making my money's worth lol! Ok the down side is this \"atas\" price ... But the price of 17.90 was reduced to 16.90 coz of the change in source of bacon. Still yumyum! Worth trying :)",

    "text": "My first experience with Omakase was at their Turf City branch and it wasn't a very good one. For the sake of fairness, I tried again and unfortunately this is one of those times where the first impression wasn't inaccurate. In all fairness, the burgers aren't that bad. We had the signature cheeseburgers and the patties aren't dry and have that juicy bite to them... Maybe a bit too much juice though as my burger kept leaking onto my tray. It also makes the patties slip out the back of the burger with every bite, and the patty was about ready to abandon the bun ship by my third bite. The buns were pretty plump and tasty but the cheese was a bit too gooey. I like my cheese lightly melted but this felt like some sort of nacho cheese that would cling to the roof of my mouth - like the buns from a McDonald's Filet o fish except it's cheese. The fries were much worse: we ordered the truffle, cheese and sweet potato varieties and only the sweet potato fries were decent. The big problem was they had the soggy texture of stale fries thinly disguised by the warmth of a recent reheat. If you've ever tried to reheat cold fries in the microwave then you'll know what I mean. The salad and onion rings were quite alright though, and a friend found the chicken burger to be quite tasty. The biggest problem I find with this place is the price. The entry level burgers are $13.90 each and that's excluding side dishes and drinks! That's two whole McValue meals and while the Omakase burger is definitely tastier, it's not THAT much better than a Big Mac. All in all, I wish I had a Carl's Jr closer to my workplace.PS one shining point though is that they were playing 90s music like Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise. I'd give an extra half star for that.",

In weekends they serve their special Beef Tallow Fries, cooked in the fat from the meet they use for the burgers. I recommend going with the Omakase Applewood Smoked Bacon Cheeseburger, fantastic!

There was a bit of a wait too here but it definitely wasn't as long as the other places. We almost had to share a table with another customer but another empty table opened up for us in time. I had the applewood bacon and my dad had the ultimate cheeseburger. We also ordered some beef tallow fries and Mexican coke. The total bill came to about nearly $50(!!!). Burgers were fantastic, melt in mouth and the pile of liquid grease was oddly satisfying to see. The bacon was absolutely superb, one of the best I've ever tasted. However my dad and I felt that there wasn't much difference between the applewood and ultimate burger (other than that the ultimate was pricier). To us, it seemed like it was an applewood with a couple of slices of mushroom added into it. Beef tallow fries were disappointing. I was fairly excited for the taste (especially since it's emphasized that it can only be ordered on the weekends) but the only reaction it elicited from both my dad and I were ones of disappointment. As another reviewer had mentioned in their review, it tasted indistinguishable to McDonald's fries. We paid $6.90 for glorified McD fries. My dad even said the ones at McD's might have even tasted better. Lastly, regarding the Mexican Coke, it's just Coke in a glass bottle, what's not to like? But pricey though.Service was meh, nothing stood out. Would definitely come back for the burgers though.",
