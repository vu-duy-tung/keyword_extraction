    "text": "My friend and myself were in VivoCity, we were looking for something to eat and Thai Express looked promising. We entered, took a seat, and menus were brought to the table. There were many items that looked good but I settled on the Khao Gai Ob Nam Pheung (Rice with Honey Chicken). My friend chose Khao Gai Phat Krapow which is rice with Stir-fried Minced Chicken with Thai Basil.The restaurant looked clean and will seat approximately 60 patrons. It was a bit slow when we were there and I noticed that the staff used this time to tidy thing up.Our orders quickly arrived, my dish had several large pieces of plump juicy chicken, it looked good and it tasted good too. My friend was happy with her choice, although she would have liked it a little more spicy. She rated her meal a 4 and I felt the same way about mine.Service was quick and efficient.",

Maybe it's the kitchen, maybe they serve slow, but our orders were curiously cool.The green curry is tasty, marred by the tasteless chicken and room temperature curry and cold white rice. The Tom yum crayfish similarly suffers from cold-warm soup when it's supposed to be hot. The Crayfish freshness is questionable but the glass noodles is tasty, just like every other glass noodles out there.Seafood Glass noodle stir fry is acceptably tasty, but forgetable. The pineapple rice is average. No additional comments.Service is so so, not too bad.Ambiance is average.Noise is quiet.No Q.",

Food was typical Thai Express standard. I wouldn't recommend frequenting this outlet just because you can pay the same price and get much better service elsewhere.",

    "text": "I have eaten at Thai Express countless times and this review is specific to the branch at Vivocity which is newly renovated. I ordered my usual favorite dish- glass noodles with soft shell crab. Having tried the ones in the native country before, I'd say that the Thai Express rendition is not too far off. I wish there's more greens in the dish though to enhance the appearance. My friend had spicy minced meat with century eggs and she liked it. The main issue is the slow service, which is puzzling when the server to customer ratio seems manageable. The restaurant manager saved the day with his \u00a0good service which is why I would not rule out visiting this branch again.",

I almost thought I had to call the ambulance because my mouth was on fire. It's my fault for not heeding the four chili warning next to the dish on the menu. The service was very slow even though the place was empty. The other dishes were ok, but nothing spectacular. I don't think I will return.",

    "text": "It was a weekday dinner but the place is pretty full! Yet we were shown to a table rather quickly so that was great! 1) Phad Thai - not bad though I found it a tad sweet. Dunno if my tongue was going crazy. 2) Fish Porridge - it's essentially flavourful soup poured over rice. The combination is not bad as my kid devoured it!3) Tom Yam Fish Vermicelli in Red Soup - my favourite choice as the spicy red soup with fish chunks goes beautifully with the Tanghoon. It's a big bowl so be hungry!4) Olive Rice - hubby's favourite option. It's nice. 5) Tom Yam Seafood Horfun - my help's favourite choice and it'll be yours too if you fancy wok-Hei fried horfun and Tom yam anything. It's a good combo of both. Thai Express is a classy fast food restaurant which decent food and reasonable pricing. Only problem I have is the amount if MSG used and I often find myself downing much water after the meal. But it's after all fast food so can't really complain.",

The seafood phad Thai was tasty but nothing special; the seafood seemed to be of the frozen variety. Servings are slightly small. They only sell bottled water and the seating is rather cramped if you have a mod-sized group. If you are at Vivo city looking for dinner I would suggest elsewhere - you can find better for a few dollars more for an entree.",

    "text": "Ever reliable Thai Express is located in the basement of Vivocity, making this branch easily accessible. Prices are relatively cheap, and the standard of food is consistent with the other branches. Favourites here include the Poo Phat Pong Kari - a plate of fluffy white rice, piled with crispy soft shell crab that's been stewed in a onion laded curry. Not exactly something you want to eat on a date, but it's pretty comforting for the times when you are feeling down. Come to Thai Express and you know what kind of food you are going to get - just do not compare it to the stuff you get at the street side stalls in Bangkok, and you'll leave more than happy",
