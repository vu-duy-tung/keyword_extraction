Finally, service was great as well. \u00a0One of the staff even recognised us the second time we went, and we felt very welcomed indeed.I highly recommend Wah Lok if you're looking for an Asian experience that's not necessarily at a hawker centre!",

Could not for the life of me understand how they managed to win so many 'awards' that lined the wall behind the concierge!The prawn dumplings were bland, and not even decently presented in the basket, rather it seemed thrown together. The BBQ pork puff with preserved vegetables did not have any preserved vegetables in them. The radish cake fried with XO sauce arrived cold as was the century egg porridge, which I subsequently sent back to be heated up. We also ordered a stir-fried vegetables with macadamia nuts - also cold, and bland, and looks like some home cook stir-fry! The siu mai is good, but one dish out of the 10 we ordered is dismal indeed.",

I was beyond impressed - which I'm sure shows - and looking forward very much to my next meal here.",

We had dimsum for lunch - Decent food though I thought portions felt a little small. I liked the Po Lo Bao, freshly made, soft bun with gooey char siew filling. Rest of the food was ok - nice but not particularly outstanding. The chee cheong fun with fried you tiao was oddly a lot more you tiao than chee cheong fun, and you had to add on the sauce separately. The steamed carrot cake is served in a dessert-looking-container, couldn't identify what it was at first!I liked that they could do exact numbers for some of the dim sum - so everyone was ensured 1 pc without too many leftovers. They served lukewarm towels at each table instead of disposable wet napkins, felt a bit like I was on a plane.",

It was rare chance to be served by such a warm and lively lady who always carried a smile on her face and everyone was impressed with the service even though we did not feedback to the management. \u00a0We were there to have a family dinner and tried some alacarte dishes. I am not a keen fan of expensive ingredients and thus I cannot comment on the taste of some food but those who had them enjoyed the delicacies.Mee Sua with Crab in Huatiao Stock ($12) was originally with Mee Sua with Lobster($22) but with opted for crabs since they were cheaper and the stock base remains the same. This was surprisingly simple but flavorful and mildly sweet. It was highly recommended by the staff and now by me because it is a nice change from the usual Yi Mian or fried noodles/rice.Hokkaido Scallops in Golden Sauce was better than the fish. The scallop was undeniably meaty and cooked to right doneness but the thin layer of fried flour batter wrapping the scallop was unnecessary.",

The fried beancurd skin prawn roll was too oily and the sliced fish congee had a thin consistency with very little ingredients. Mango pudding was the only decent thing we had.

However, having just returned from Hong Kong a few days before my lunch at Wah Lok, I was disappointed to discover that the dim sum at Wah Lok, despite being one of Singapore's best dim sum restaurants, still can't compare to the typical dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong. The porridge was boring (perhaps its the nature of the dish?) and unmemorable but more significantly, I thought it was overpriced. The Po Lo Bao receives rave reviews online but I was let down by the thick pastry crust and overly starchy char siew filling. I prefer a light, fresh and crisp pastry crust. The chee cheong fun was also thick, and did not have a delicate, translucent texture, which I would have preferred.Perhaps standards are dipping. I'll probably check out other dim sum restaurants in Singapore.",
