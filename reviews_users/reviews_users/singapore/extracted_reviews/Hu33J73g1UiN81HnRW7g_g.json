Their baristas are true experts, their coffee beans carefully selected - and you can pick from two coffee bean choices every day - with the coffee itself being pure velvety, strong goodness.Ask for the stamp card if it is not automatically given to you, as you'll get a free coffee once your card is full.The staff is cheerful and seems to love what they're doing. Food is quite good - I've had pasta, bacon & egg muffin and a ham & cheese melt before.My current crush is their Red Velvet latte, which is an absolute revelation that I don't know how to live without anymore. Good for them, tricky for me ;)",

    "text": "This is one of two Jewel outlets in Singapore. The other one is on Rangoon Road and this smaller one is on Shenton Way in the CBD. Not surprisingly the guests and feel of the places differ a lot. This is more the go to place for a caffeine fix or a quick lunch for all the people slaving away in the CBD and unfortunately that also impacts the service here as it often feels rushed, not that friendly and occasionally the quality of the coffee is not at the level I am expecting here. That said the coffee is usually good and there is at least two beans to choose from and several different brew methods. I try to come after morning rush but before the lunch rush as the quality of the coffee is usually better when they have more time for it. The seating is limited indoors but there are some tables outside where it is fine to hang out for longer periods of time. The food is very much something that can be skipped. There are so many better options to get your stomach filled around here. Still it is a pretty safe bet for a cup of coffee when in the CBD although I would personally rather head to the New Black for filter coffee and 6 oz Espresso for espresso based beverages but this is also good.",

I'd like to say that our cafe scene in Singapore is good, but in all honesty it's only cafes like Jewel that make it good. Their coffee and the standard of their coffee is a benchmark. I've been to both their outlets and not only is the coffee good but the food at Rangoon Rd is pretty awesome as well. Forgive their small outlet in CBD, it's obviously catered for take & go but I'm guessing that it's the only way they can sustain the high rental in the area. When somebody ask me which is my favorite cafe in Singapore, Jewel is usually the first name that pops into my head.",

    "text": "I just stumbled across Jewel on my lunch break. I'm always on the lookout for a great cup of coffee, so even though I wasn't planning to get coffee, I obviously took my discovery as a sign from the universe that I should get a cup. Since Jewel is located directly across from Dimbulah, I turned to my fellow Yelpers for guidance on which joint to try & I'm so glad I went with the Jewel reviewers (Jewelers?).I got a basic mocha & it is phenomenal. I am drinking it as-is, no milk or sugar or whatever added, & it's delish - smooth, mellow, nutty, with slight citrus undertones. I could drink this for days!Another reviewer mentioned that Jewel's coffees are strong & can be bitter; I don't find mine bitter at all, but I should mention that I normally don't add sugar to flavored coffees as I find the syrup more than sweet enough. This is def the best coffee I've had in Singapore & my only regret is that I've lived across the street from Jewel for 4+ months & only discovered it today.",

    "text": "A haven for coffee lovers in the CDB, Jewel coffee is doing some interesting things with single origin coffees, and with different brewing methods. Espresso - the volume was perfect, with a medium dark crema. The dominant flavour in the shot is citrus - but it's a shot where the astringency is very evident - as much a sensation as a flavour, an intense hit of citrus that awakens your taste buds, with an aftertaste that fades out slowly. The mouthfeel has some syrupy elements, but not overwhelmingly so either. The choice of single origin beans is a nice touch - when I visited, beans from Costa Rica and El Salvador were being served. Each has distinct tasting notes, however I found that the citrus elements were dominant in each. This is an intensely floral shot, and may not be to everyone's tastes. I'll never complain about single origin coffees on a menu - it's a sign of how far coffee culture has come, and it directly benefits the farmers who grow the beans in question. However, it could be a good idea to have one strong citrus single origin and one robust, earthy and less floral single origin paired with each other. The cappuccino that I ordered came with smooth foam that complemented, rather than drowned out, the underlying coffee flavour. The layer of microbubbles added the required smooth mouthfeel, while allowing the coffee flavour to dominate. The layer of foam and serving size were just as they should be, ensuring that this was separate and distinct from a latte. The latte art, and contrast of light on medium dark foam, was a welcome touch.There is a good selection of drinks on the menu, with Chemex, V60, Syphon and Iced coffees available also. It's a good coffee choice for anyone working in the Shenton Way area, however it is slightly more expensive, with an espresso priced at $4.20.",

I've been going to these guys on-and-off for over a year and while I'm not there on a daily basis I can attest to their coffee being of fairly reliable quality.Jewel offer only single origin coffee on their espresso machine. I think this is overkill as there's nothing wrong with a good blend but the origins they have on offer (they usually have two to choose from) are normally pretty good.Cafe owners passionate about coffee usually find it difficult to find service staff in SIngapore that can match them in knowledge and obsession, which usually affects the quality of the service. But the service quality at Jewel has definitely improved dramatically since I first started coming here which is very heartening to see.My only gripe about the place is that it's obviously set up more to cater to the take-away office crowd (of which I am also part) than the drink-in coffee drinker. This is evidenced by their lack of seating inside the shop itself (they have a sizeable al fresco area), their use of bar-stools and the self service set up. While I understand why a business owner would employ self service, I'm just not a fan. I don't like juggling two coffees while opening a door. It's a recipe for disaster if you're as clumsy as I am.Bottom line though, these guys serve some of the best coffee in Singapore and their sandwiches are pretty good also. Give it a shot.",

It's a great place to have a quick meeting or to catch up with a friend. Unfortunately the indoor, air-conditioned area is small so you may have to sit outside when it is busy.
