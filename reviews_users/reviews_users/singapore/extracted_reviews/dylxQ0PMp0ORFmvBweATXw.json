    "text": "I love Italian food but I rarely eat Italian in Singapore as I find that most places overpriced and overrated food. Gattopardo is an exception: I still find it on the pricey side but the food was quite good.On a Monday evening the restaurant was relatively quiet but there was quite a lot of staff present. The service was ok: friendly and prompt but nothing special.I was pleasantly surprised that, even though I only ordered a main, they gave me a complimentary amuse bouche and sourdough & focaccia bread. The bread was a rare gem, I find it amazingly hard to get decent bread here and this bread was on point!The Taglioloni with sea urchin & bottarga sauce looked like a small-ish portion when it arrived but looks can be deceiving: I finished every single drop but was super full afterwards and passed on dessert. This pasta dish was very good, the briny taste of the sea urchin combined with the delicate flavor of good quality pasta and a hint of parsley made this into a winner.One of the better Italian restaurants in Singapore, will go again to try other dishes if I have the opportunity.",

    "text": "After hearing rave reviews from my foodie friend, we decided to use the Entertainer App to try this place. We ordered:Mains:- Zuppa (seafood stew)- Tonarelli (squid ink with mussels and pistachio pesto)Starters:- Burrata- Octopus Overall the starters were excellent, if not a little pricey relative to the portion sizes (ie very small). However there's not a lot of cooking involved with the burrata it has to be said. The mains were a bit more underwhelming. Zuppa was generous with seafood, but lacked and flavour or seasoning. Truth be told it's probably something most decent home chefs could cook themselves. The squid ink tonarelli was quite nice, with excellent bite to the pasta. Mussels were fat and sweet. Pistachio pesto was interesting...but overall it tasted rather like a Thai dish. (By the way there's a fair bit of Asian influence in the menu here).Service was very average, and they lose a star because of it. \u00a0It didn't start well when they didn't have our reservation. Wait staff had zero personality or warmth. We sat for a very long time with empty/dirty plates on our table, and had to ask a waiter for the dessert menu after we gave up waiting. Our waters were not topped up a single time during our meal. These sound like petty gripes, but really if you're meant to be a quality establishment then the entire experience should be top notch. I would return to try the food nonetheless, and lower my expectations for service.",

    "text": "DELICIOUS, oh-so-good italiano (more specifically, sicilian) dining at this small, cozy little restaurant along tras street. this reivew is a long time coming, given that I ate here during my birthday (six months ago, hello!), but it's a goodie (even if it is also an oldie now).we got a delightful little corner table on the ground floor - sunlight streaming in, in full view of the bricked facade of the kitchen. attention is a little spotty, in a relaxed sort of manner - they certainly can move quickly, as they did with the table next to ours that was clearly there for a swift lunch.I was impressed with first dish of salad - it was rather beautiful with the colors of the orange and red cabbage, and the flavors were perky and fresh with the endive and sweet cooked prawn strewn throughout. the dressing is light and clean, with a measured use of olive oil that keeps everything crisp and cool.and then our mains arrived - and boy, were they good. first, the zuppa di pesce 'gattopardo', the house special of seafood stew was served in a rustic pot with all the intensity you'd have expected in a bisque. if you get this, I think you'll be just as surprised as we were at the amount of seafood in there, and how tenderly all the different types of fish were cooked.and for something to sop the stew up, a risone con polipo brasato e midollo di bue, which is italian for grain-shaped pasta cooked with firm octopus and bone marrow. I think bone marrow is one of those modern, fancy ingredients that you see almost too often, and which I almost always avoid for its fatty oiliness - but here, it worked with the orzo to create a silky, lovely pasta. and I haven't even mentioned the tasty, deep flavors of the pasta sauce, or the firm octopus (which is one of my favorite seafoods ever).we finished with two desserts (but of course - the fiance understands my need for sweets). and while I have to say I'm not in general a fan of italian desserts, seeing as how many are basically constructions of cream or semifreddo, but these were really satisfying.the millefoglie was a mille-feuille with puff pastry layers encasing chocolate and caramel mousse-creams, and it all reads really sweet until you realise that the unique comopnents of vanilla oil and smoked sea salt really bring that something special to the dish.we also took the signature semifreddo di lino of nougat parfait with an almond sauce - you might not typically like whipped cream (real here, of course!) but it does bring a mild counterpoint to the sweet semifreddo and balances things out.I'm really bad with compliments, but we might have had our best meal this year here.",

We had their tagliolini with uni and homemade spaghetti in a tomato seafood sauce, both were excellent. Each table is presented with complimentary hors d'oeuvres both to begin and end the meal which is definitely something you don't see often anymore unless you're at a michelin. Highly recommend this place for those looking to celebrate a special occasion.",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner at Gattopardo Italian Grill and Pizzabar.First, I must say that the service here was spectacular. \u00a0They were attentive, professional, and polite. \u00a0As far as a fine dining experience, this exemplifies what I expect in service. \u00a0Each time we needed something, someone appeared.After my dining companion complimented the dessert and her meal, the chef even came out to the \u00a0table.Next, the ambiance is beautiful. \u00a0This is for the al fresco area. \u00a0The tables are well spaced. \u00a0It is a wonderful veranda. \u00a0It has a feel of being on vacation.However, you may have noticed I've only given three stars. \u00a0Unfortunately, the food was simply inconsistent. \u00a0As I stated, my friend really enjoyed her main and dessert. \u00a0Other portions of the meal simply did not stack up. \u00a0For the most part, each dish was presented very well.Tomato Soup - This was a complimentary chilled tomato soup. \u00a0Generally, I am not a fan of chilled soups. \u00a0I found this one quite refreshing. \u00a0My friend did not. \u00a0She pretty much ignored it.Prosciutto di Parma Pio Tosini e Burrata di Andria (24 Months Aged Parma Ham \"Pio Tosini\" with Burrata Cheese)This was so very good. \u00a0The saltiness of the prosciutto with the creaminess of the buratta just came together so well.tinyurl.com/bzwc79kMozzarella di Bufala e Cuore di Bue (Buffalo Mozzarella Cheese with Italian \"Ox Heart\" Tomatoes and Fresh Salad)And yes, if you are thinking a meal with Burrata and Mozzarella is pretty decadent, you are right, it is. \u00a0The mozzarella itself was too die for. \u00a0It was so creamy. \u00a0However, the tomatoes were run of the mill. \u00a0They were overly acidic and lacked the sweetness I would desire in a dish like this.tinyurl.com/bbflph9Linguine alle Vongola Gigante \u00a0(Linguine with Japanese Surf Clams in White Wine Sauce) - This was my companions entree. It was quite good. \u00a0The pasta was cooked perfectly and the seafood was obviously very fresh.tinyurl.com/arszvfcTagine di Pollo con Harissa e Couscous (Free Range Chicken Tagine with Harissa and Couscous)Unfortunately, this was my main. \u00a0For me, it was mostly inedible. \u00a0The way the chicken had been reconstituted or stuffed led to a bland and overly grainy dish. \u00a0I would think harrissa would keep any dish from being bland; but not in this case. \u00a0The couscous was very dense and retained a lot of water.tinyurl.com/bcu2ev9Frutti e Sorbetti (Fresh Seasonal Fruits and Homemade Sorbets)I did not have dessert. \u00a0My dining companion loved her sorbets and fruit. \u00a0She just kept raving about it. \u00a0That being said, we did have a bottle and a half of very good red wine. \u00a0At that point, she may have raved about a snickers bar.Overall, if my main course had been enjoyable, this would have been the type of experience that defines fine dining. \u00a0The service was impeccable. \u00a0The ambiance was resort like. \u00a0At times, the food demonstrated flashes that met my expectations. \u00a0However, when a dinner is going to come in at over $500 for two, it really has to meet all marks. \u00a0Unfortunately, Gattopardo did not.",

Having tried 8 out of the 20 types of pizza available, I must say that it's only a matter of time before I go through all. And I have not been disappointed so far. The ambience of the restaurant, especially the al fresco areas are breathtakingly beautiful, and make for a wonderful experience of dining under the stars. While they don't only serve pizzas, bear in mind that they're more known for their seafood and pastas, which are very traditional Sicillian.",
