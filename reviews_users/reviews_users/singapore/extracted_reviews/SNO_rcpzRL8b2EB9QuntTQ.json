    "text": "Located near Somerset313, Bedrock Bar & Grill is one of the high-end Western restaurants in the area. The restaurant design is sleek and modern, featuring a VIP private dining room and a half-open kitchen concept. Diners can see the finishing touches to certain dished, like blowtorch on the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. My favourite part of the entire dining experience was the bread basket. Instead of the conventional bread or baguette, each diner was served with their specialty which largely resembled a nan. But the true star of the dish was the garlic. The restaurant prepares whole cloves of garlic in a variety of herbs and spices which can be placed directly on the bread and consumed. Honestly the best garlic I have ever had. Gone is the overwhelming spiciness of garlic. In its place is the subtle fragrance of garlic, infused with other rich flavours from the herbs. Each piece of garlic is so soft it crumbles with the lightest touch, making it easy to consume and spread on the bread. But at this point of time, we were just eating the slices whole. It was that good. Other dishes were slightly above the usual fare but in my opinion, not worth the steep prices. The overall experience was slightly marred by the fact that one customer complained of a hair in her fries. But the service staff did offer to immediately replace the dish with a new serving. Location wise is also pretty good, right smack in the middle of the popular stretch of Orchard Road. Worth a try if you're looking for somewhere fancy for a night out!",

    "text": "Thought I was going to a comfort food place but it turned out to be a fancy restaurant that sells good steaks rather than \"quick\" food. We ordered the porterhouse with asparagus and broccoli on the side. The porterhouse was really good and the portion is good for two people. We went with the mustard sauce which went well with the steak. We almost got the truffle fries as a side but the portion of it was huge. Unless you are three people I don't recommend going for the fries due to the size of it unless you are ok with throwing food away or eating a lot of fries which can't be good for you.",

The Mac and cheese delivered, but the aged tbone steak failed. Wine by the glass was sub par as well, kinda like the wine you'd expect at TGI Friday's. Personally, if I was going to spend $70pp on a steak dinner, I would opt to spend $90 to be satisfied. Three stars because their menu has aged steak and they took us as a walk in guest.",

Service was poor as they broke two wine glasses (staff) and dropped a piece of bread while serving, and the food not only came 30 mins after we ordered but steak also came out lukewarm and not sizzling hot as a steakhouse should. It was a bone in porterhouse we ordered, the more expensive steak cut (mind you it was $180) but to a meat eater this was just a terrible piece of meat that shouldn't be served to a guest who's paying that much for a steak. The fillet mignon side is supposed to be soft and easy to cut and the strip side was also just so difficult to cut and chew. I much prefer Luke's oyster bar and grill if you're looking for good steak. Save yourself from bad calories, service and steak by doing yourself this favor and skipping this restaurant completely.",

    "text": "Really bummed about this place. After all the rave recommendations (and the high prices) I expected to finally have a decent steak in Singapore. But for $90 a steak, I expect it to be aged properly, cooked to how I ordered, and with good flavour. None of those things happened. I'm astounded that a place that is meant to be known for steak only has one item on its menu which is dry-aged. Please go and visit Rockpool in Australia. It has options ranging from 28 day all the way up to 90 day aged steaks. It has its own aging room and all meats are hung and aged on-site. It was more rare than medium rare, and I had trouble cutting through it even with the sharp steak knife. It totally lacked any flavour, except for one that resembled burnt gas / oil. On the plus side, the sides were very nice for the most part. Truffle fries were well cooked.....however I struggled to detect any truffle flavour. PS Cafe has better truffle fries I think. The Mac n cheese was very good, as were the beef tallow potatoes, though I would've liked them to be less soggy. Overall? $550 for 4 of us (with 2 glasses of wine) was massively steep for a pretty average meal. Thankfully we used the Entertainer which made it more palatable, but otherwise it wouldn't be worth visiting.",

    "text": "Bedrock used to be the absolute shining star in Singapore several years ago as THE PLACE TO BE FOR STEAKS even with competition directly with Morton's and Wolfgang Puck's Cut. However, over the years, as the trend seems to go in Singapore F&B businesses, restaurants weaken their strengths because their owners find a reason to shift their strengths elsewhere perhaps to start a new business elsewhere and to ultimately place well established and well performing businesses such as Bedrock down in the pits. That is exactly what happened at Bedrock. It went from a shining star for anyone that serves steak to be envied of to a place that was hanging onto life support for faithful customers to return.For more than a year, we had refused to go back there because the steak was simply not cooked properly. Medium rare steaks would come out as medium to well cooked steak. Simply unacceptable for a steak restaurant.History aside, we recently went back to try it to see if anything had changed. We noticed two improvements.First, their current Rotisserie has improved his skills since the last time we sampled it. Medium rare came out medium rare to medium in the Tomahawk but despite this improvement, the steak's marble grading seems to have dropped quite a bit as we were not experiencing the same tender juiciness as we had experienced years ago.Second, we liked what they did with the small alfresco space outside adding a bar snacks menu. Unfortunately, while being seated there waiting for our table to be ready, the floor staff failed to capitalise on the opportunity and to offer us a drink or try their bar snacks.On the topic of service, we left a voice message on Friday for someone to call us back for a reservation line but received no call back the following day. We had to chase for our own reservation. Service attitude seems to have dropped.One further note, their jamon appears to have shrunk in size landing us smaller pieces than we are used to.To finish on a good note, their wine list continues to be small but adequate and their truffle mash is just as good as we remembered it.We'll be back and hopefully, see consistency and further improvements in their quality and service to lift their game.",

Next was my Tuna Steak which I asked for medium rare.. and it was cooked exactly like what I requested.

    "text": "i went here with colleagues for our quarterly \"steak night\". Taking time to enjoy a steak and a drink with colleagues is good team building. Bedrock was the second restaurant visited and came with high expectations that fell short on a couple of fronts.As far as the food goes, we just ordered smoked chili fries as an appetizer to leave room for the steak. The fries were not that special and seemed to be just a basket of fries dusted with chili powder. Washed down with some happy hour Carlsberg the scene was set for the entree's. After a lengthy wait, our steaks arrived with the sides. Surveying the table made me realise, none of us were really vegetable lovers with only one side of asparagus to accompany duck fat potatoes, Fries and mac n'cheese. We ordered three ribeyes and two tenderloins. One of the tenderloin's was sent back for being too well done. For the rest of us, the level of \"doneness\" was correct, but given the steaks were no more than an inch thick and were served on a very hot skillet, they ended up all being a little too well done. Flavor was good, but really for me I had higher expectations given the reputation of the place, as well as the price being paid. The stars were the mac n'cheese and the duck fat potatoes and that should never be the case in a restaurant that prides itself on its steaks,The service was OK, apart from the long wait for the steaks. the staff had their game on when it came to topping up our glasses, but why does happy hour only apply outside and not inside? Not sure of the logic behind this. Given that Singapore has plenty of good steak restaurants, we will definitely be trying an alternative, next time.",

We ordered the following for 4 people:-shared the Duck salad (a bit too much balsamic vinegar...a bit too salty)-share bone marrow - 2 pieces (yummy)-My husband and I shared an Australian grassfed porterhouse with black pepper sauce and added on $6 truffle butter (probably unnecessary), but it was surprisingly the same size as one of our friend's US sirloin steak. The steak was a bit tough to cut, but it was partly because the knives provided as part of the table setting were less effective...then the waiter offered better ones when they saw us having trouble (this was a bit strange that they didn't just offer better knives in the first place). Our porterhouse I thought was a bit harder to chew at medium, but our other friend's tenderloin was exactly that...very tender and juicy.There was a bit of a wait between the appetizers and entrees, so we brought it to the manager's attention and you could see that he definitely checked on our orders. Service was attentive and the complimentary naan-like bread was pretty good with the butter and roasted garlic provided.Overall, it was a very pleasant Friday night dining experience.",

The mac and cheese were a huge hit with us, as were the truffled mash potatoes. Not as sublime as as Joel Robuchon's but quite good nonetheless.
