    "text": "The Case of the Confused Fast Food. Now... I don't normally write reviews about fast food joints. Not because they're not good or creative but well.... It's because they're fast food outlets. They should taste the same everywhere? Right?I couldn't help but write this because of the \"rebranding\", if you could call it that, that MOS burger is trying to do. It's not uncommon either. In recent years, we've seen McDonald's launch McCafe, KFC having KFC cafe, so it comes as little surprise that another fast food outlets decides to join the fray. MOS caf\u00e9, newly rebranded, offering desserts and some new innovative burgers like the Wagyu Tower or the Osaka yaki rice burger, the Tortilla salad, vegetable smoothies, all items not found at other MOS outlets. They even had mock displays of their food at the entrance, all nicely presented on plates and looking pretty good. Even a look at their website is impressive, \"MOS Caf\u00e9 was conceptualised as a FLAGSHIP CAFE that caters to the LIFESTYLE of our consumers....... Driven by a \"FRESH\" CONCEPT - using lots of fresh vegetables and fruits. The menu is made up of ORIGINAL Caf\u00e9 items as well as items CAREFULLY CURATED from the MOS burger menu\". Sounds exciting. However, upon reaching the entrance of the restaurant, with exception to the huge \"MOS Caf\u00e9\" sign, nothing much has changed. It still looks like a MOS burger, the seats still look the same, no cozy sofa corners and still filled with booth seats. The ordering counter looked the same and even the uniform was the same (at least McCafe took the effort to give the barista's a different outfit). \u00a0But well.... We decided to give it a shot. Once ordering, it was clearly confirmed to me that... It was nothing but a sad rebranding attempt and an even desperately gimmicky attempt to make themselves look and sound updated.Firstly, I get the same number tag I get at MOS burger. Fair enough. Than came my cups in a regular mos burger paper cup. No change there. But when our orders came, the all too familiar basket appeared. In it were our burgers and fries. What happened to all the nicely played burgers you were promoting by the window? Why was everything still wrapped? I don't deny it.. I felt cheated. Anyway... On to the food. I won't spend too much time on the regular items as I'm sure we're pretty familiar with those. Osaka Yaki burger. Now this looked good... In picture and on display. Of course I'm not expecting it to look the same when served, especially not since its in a wrapper. Taste wise.... Decent. However, I am left with figuring out what I actually ate. While the image showed a nice layer of egg, fried seafood patty topped with bonito flakes, I could only make the egg out in the burger itself. I'm still trying to figure out the protein they gave. Was it fish? Prawns? No clue. Unfortunately, the project they embarked on fell pretty much on its face.Don't get me wrong, I love MOS burger, but, in terms of this being a flagship concept and a cafe? It's more a MOS burger doing cosplay on a budget than it is actually being a MOS Cafe.",

I longed for your rice burgers when I moved to Australia and then Canada/America. Now I'm back here I wanted to rekindle our love. But when you told me you didn't have diet/light Coke, you spat right into my mouth. And to top it off, you did not allow me to pay using my credit card. Not. Cool. Bra. Not. Cool.From 5 to 3 and now 1. Why? Well as I went over to trash my wrappers and return the tray I saw you emptying the tea from the dispenser - it was closing time and you were draining different teas into one bucket. So I asked, even though I know it's not typically refillable, \"hey mind pouring me some? I did buy a whole last cup of unsweetened ice tea\". \"No refilling\". \"But you're pouring them away right?\". No answer and you just looked away.Service. Matters. Douche.",

    "text": "A better choice among fast food chains? Come to Mos Burger. It is a Japanese fast food chain and there are a few in Singapore. The first chains I tried was at west mall and isetan Scotts but those stores closed down. I was browsing on what's to eat at raffles city and I was delighted to find mos burger here.Personally I am into ebi rice burger but that changed after I had allergy breakouts after eating shellfish. So looking at what's on their advertisements, I spotted salmon rice burger. All I can say is you keep wanting for more if you eat it. The salmon was cooked perfectly with the sauce on top and covered with rice buns. Yum...Service is extremely fast at this chain even though the workers are mostly elderly. You can get your order within 2-3 minutes if you do take away. Depending on what time you stop by, you might be able to find seats. I tried two chains : one near to clementi mall and the other in Ang mo kio and I still love this chain. This is the healthier choice of burgers if you consistently think about calories. YAY to Mos Burger!!",

You can get your tea less sweet, or get Barbecue sauce, etc. I love that they serve stuff in a tray and you take it out of the paper bags, etc.What I Love: Their Rice Burgers are yummmmmy. I've had the beef and chicken ones. If you want something light, then skip the Rice Burgers. They are a reasonable size - but once you have them, you'll realize that it is pretty filling. Their yummy fries and deep-fried scallops are to die for. And their nuggets. Really does beat McDonald's. And their mayo.... yum!!!What I Don't Love: Their soup. It's nothing special. And their prices! A few stuff added up together and it's like $8-$10....",
