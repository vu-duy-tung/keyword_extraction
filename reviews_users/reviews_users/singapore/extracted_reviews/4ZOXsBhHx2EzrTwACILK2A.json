Food is consistently good, so I definitely enjoy coming here and I always book, too crowded not to. A bit on the pricey side, so not an everyday affair. They do charge extra for nuts and wet towelettes, without really making you aware. On this night I went they already had everything on the table, so it was hard to say no once it was there. So definitely take your own towel or wet wipes, cause you will need them.",

The highlight of the meal being the amazing Chili Crab - with a sauce/masala that is like crack and will have you licking the crab shell. The almost equally tasty Pepper Crab is phenomenal as well but not as saucy. We ordered fried and steamed buns and fried rice - both of which are perfect accompaniments for soaking up every last drop of chili crab sauce. We also ordered sticky, tender melt of the bone pork BBQ spare ribs and fried shrimp in pumpkin sauce that were both standouts as well. The peanuts with chili sauce was a nice appetizer touch. The other Jumbo seafood apparently has Peking duck but this one does not - not sure of the reasoning. The service was mostly attentive and hovered around well but communication was at times difficult. Never the less - a truly fantastic meal and one to remember.",

Staff very attentive, so I got my table. Ordered my way through Lobster dragonfruit salat (too much Mayo, hardly found the lobster), deep fried baby squids (nice, fried to death and drowned in caramelized sugar) and giant shrimps grilled with a soja reduction (they were at my expectation). The traditioal pepper crab I knew and left aside this time. The wine ordered ( they have an amazing wine window at the entry \u00a0its just a window), was served way too late and warm (a Bordeaux blanc, what a pity). I understand that they can handle chilled Tiger beer, its the predominant order, but at least a couple of bottles of white wine should find their place in the fridge.So in a word: This was the second time (since 1998) and definitely the last, the offer isnt worth the price, however staff, service, logistics, location (waterfront) are impressive, but the food isnt.

Took about 20 min to get my water after having asked 2nd time. The chili sauce in the crab is good but nothing like it will blow you out of water or anything. The black pepper crab is very peppery and hot. If you dine outside, goodluck. I will not recommand anyone to try this place.

My bf and I shared a table with a sweet couple from Thailand and another gentleman. We sat outside under the cover of the canopy, so it was nice to see the water and lights around us as we ate. I would recommend refusing the tea and peanuts at the beginning of the meal if you don't want to pay for them. Skip all the extras like the seafood fried rice (overrated and overpriced) and get yourself a chili crab, a few fried mantous per person, and garlic baby bok choy. Pray that your food comes all at once and you're not devouring the veggies while waiting for your crab, and then waiting for the plain white rice when you're already 3/4 done with your crab.As for the chili crab, the sauce is just amazing! We paid about $88 SGD for a 1.3 kg crab. It can get messy, so just release your inhibitions, put on your bib, and dig in! The rice and fried buns are just vehicles to eat as much of the delicious sauce as possible. If I had no shame, I would've taken the leftover sauce home with us. The crab was big enough to feed the two of us, and then some!",

It comes in a huge pot full of sloppy sauce that was WAAAAAYYYY too sweet and not nearly spicy enough. It's so difficult and messy to eat. and not worth the effort.We also ordered the much recommended, cereal shrimp. This was also way too sweet. It is basically shrimp that is breaded in a sort of sweet, granola like cereal. The shrimp itself was fresh and tasty, but the cereal was far too sweet.We ordered the taro(yam) sea scallops. It was a sea scallop sandwiched around taro/yam and deep fried. It was okay, but some folks in our party thought it was a bit too mushy.We got a tofu/mushroom dish - it wasn't all that good, skip.The fried rice was okay - the rice was a bit undercooked. Go to Din Tai Fung for the fried rice.All in all, not impressed. \u00a0Then we get the bill... holy sh****t. It was $85 PER crab (it was the size of a California dungeness). We got 2 ($170) for 8 people and we did not finish it - didn't taste good and too messy.Yes, tea and peanuts are not free, but what's a few dollars when the crab is so exorbitant. Skip.",

On a friend's suggestion, we went to Jumbo Seafood. I was warned that it could be very busy and I might have to wait, but when I got there and asked for a table of three, they mysteriously found a table for me among the huge crowd of filled up tables.Chili crab - Tastes as good as I remember. Good meaty chunks in the claws, and the shell had a good amount of crab fat still in it. MmmMantou - Get this! And dip it in the crab sauce!Fried rice - StandardCold dishes - At this point we were so full that I barely even cared anymore. But they did have the Chinese cold spiced beef that I always love!I also got myself an Italian Apple sparkling soda, which was quite delicious!Bill was fairly reasonable. Crab is always decently expensive, so splitting among 3 isn't a bad idea. Overall, lives up to its reputation!",

As you might expect, the menu is mainly fish and seafood \u00a0one signature dish is the chili crab, which was good, but not exceptional. Expect to order a selection of smaller dishes, and one or two bigger ones if you're in a party. Although , to be honest, I'd say on our visit the food was hit and miss, there is plenty to tempt here, and a very real danger of grossly overordering. Hits included baby squid and a surprisingly gamey Peking duck; misses included salted egg shrimp ( undercooked batter, more akin to unfinished scrambled egg) and scallop and yam fritters ( strangely boring pucks of brown matter around soft and tasteless scallops). Expect to pay about SGD60/person, including drinks; it's really quite reasonable.",

    "text": "Touristy and busy but conveniently situated in Clarke Quay. We were lucky we did not have to wait for a table as we were open to sharing a round table with 4 other strangers. We were there for good crab so didn't care. We ordered one chili crab and 4 mantous (fried bread for dipping the delicious sauce) and a small order of cereal prawns split between two people. It was more than enough for us as we ate it all. Although we might have been able to eat more but we were sitting outside and it was hot, humid, uncomfortable and definitely changed our usual appetites. We had previously asked if we could sit indoors and still share tables but the waitress said no.The chili crab was so good! It was sweet with a kick. Normally I can't handle spice and I might have been struggling with my mouth feeling like it was on fire but the crab was too good to pass up. However for people who can handle spice, this will be nothing for you. Mantous were perfect for dipping in the chili crab sauce! The cereal prawns were good but by then I was getting so stuffed that I did not enjoy as much. Food was good but my complaints are just that the service was not good, they are not attentive nor friendly. They nickel and dime you for everything including the \"peanuts and tea\" they place on the table for their customers. They should really not give peanuts unless it is requested because tourists or non-regulars will not be aware and see that their are additional charges on their bill. Just seems sneaky and shady.",

When the crab arrived one of the claws smelled strongly of ammonia and one of the leg segments was ice cold. When we complained, the manager denied being able to smell the rotten meat and assured me that they \"sell hundreds of kilos of crab every day\" so somehow that should reassure me.

Having tasted both chilli crab and black pepper crab, I prefer the black pepper crab, because chilli crab seems to use a lot of ketchup and is too sweet for my taste. Service is poor. On our recent visit, the server kept coming over to take away empty, or not quite empty, dishes on the table one by one -- great way to make sure your guests get annoyed and leave within minutes, I reckon. Expensive. We spent S$200 on a dinner for three, including one black pepper crab, some seafood tofu dish that tasted a bit off, a vegetable dish, rice and a jug of Tiger beer. Disappointing beer for disappointing food.",

Make a reservation or be ready to stand in a long queue. It's clean inside, the staff is friendly and very efficient. Plates are cleared and swapped regularly, drinks refilled, dishes brought in a timely manner and coursed. Of course you have to get chili crab. Don't forget the wee fried buns to dip in the chili sauce- that's half the fun. I know this place is famous for the crab but I love the pumpkin shrimp. It's full of flavor and has crisp veggies underneath. It's easily my favorite dish here. The salted egg shrimp are good too. If your group is big enough order the whole duck. They prepare it table side. The crispy skin is removed and sliced then rolled in cigars. The rest is chopped and served on a platter. The flavor is great - deep and smokey. I've never had any room for dessert when we eat here! Too much seafood in the way.",

    "text": "One of the best places to try Singapore's famous dish: Chilli crab, especially if you're a tourist. This is because Jumbo is located in easy to access areas for tourists, including this branch directly opposite Clarke Quay, so you'll have a great view of Clarke Quay especially at night. Every time I have guests in town, I will try bringing them here, or to the Dempsey outlet,... etc. One of the reasons is because overall the food is decent and the price is more attractive than it's upper-tier competitors.The unfortunate part is that since this location is immensely popular with tourists, you will have to reserve seats at least two days in advance especially for the weekend dinners! Some bright spark food reviewer from Japan and Korea wrote about Jumbo in their travel guidebooks, therefore you will always find Japanese and Korean tourists swarming in lines for the tasty crab.Recommendations: Chilli crab (of course) together with the mantou (fried buns - at least 2 per pax recommended) to dip into the succulent chilli sauce, bamboo clams, tofu with seaweed.Tips: You can choose which crab! Choose the normal ones (it's already big enough!), so you don't have to choose the Alasakan ones which will cost you a bomb.Oh yes - this being a Chinese restaurant, don't expect the service to be good. You have been warned!",

    "text": "The food was decent - I had a small chili crab, a small black pepper crab and a couple of side dishes. By small I meant somewhere around 1kg, most crabs are approximately 1.5kg. Well, the chili crab's sauce was awesome but the crabmeat was lackluster, I much preferred the black pepper crabmeat which was pretty tasty. Unfortunately, my otherwise rather pleasant experience was the ruined by Jumbo's shady business practices. First up, a Chinese family beside me was almost duped into buying(wasting) an Alaskan crab on a chili crab dish. Luckily they asked for the prices and declined when it was $500+. They settled on the standard crabs. After they left, a Korean couple took their place at the table beside mine; as they were browsing through the menu, I gave them a few tips on which crabs to order(to prevent a repeat of the Alaskan ripoff). When the manager came over to take their order, I just couldn't believe my ears: he recommended they grab two freaking crabs each. That's just not right! I jumped in and told these innocent tourists to grab one to share and then another if it's not enough. The manager gave me the evil eye and proceeded to explain that some people could eat two crabs... \u00a0Bullshit, the smallest crabs are at least 1kg(2.2lbs). And these folks ordered side dishes too.Since this business allows such unscrupulous upselling, it makes one wonder if they're an ethical business ...if the crabs bought were fresh... if they were actually 1.1kg... if they were from the same crab or dead pieces from various crabs... I have no answer except this restaurant ain't worth it. I'm paying $250 for a meal of two. I want unquestionable good crabs, service and business practices to boot. Folks, search for \"No Signboard\" seafood restaurant at Geylang on Yelp if you want awesome crabs with huge bang for your buck. You're welcome ~",

    "text": "If you come to Singapore, you have to try some good seafood. Teochew and Hokkien cooking really knows how to take seafood to the next level that you won't find anywhere else in the world. Behold, the famous Singaporean Chili/Black Pepper Crab! We ordered also the baby squid, taro scallop, Salted Egg Shrimp, and Pork alongside. A feast for a king for sure! Worth the money if you love high end bougie hearty stuff. This is located right by the Quay, so you get lovely scenery and the bar scene is super nice at night after you're done. Great pics of the skyline of Singapore from here as well. Pork: Goodness, ribs done to the next level. Savory, sweet, and covered with the satisfying almond crunch on top. Great way to kick off our meal Baby Squid: Taste of sweet sesame over crunchy but still slightly chewy squid. Baby squid is tender and having each individual squid per bite is so different from rings or calamari in my opinion. The texture and taste is sweet and naturally tender. Taro Scallop- If you love taro, then you gotta try Teochew or Singaporean version of taro. It is usually fried until aromatic paired with some coconut milk and gingko nuts at the end of a high end meal. This is to the next level- they deep fried it with these large succulent scallops in the middle. Holy cow. If this is not some delicious rich stuff, then idk what else is. Salted Egg Shrimp: Does this meal get \u00a0better or what? Salted egg is such a unique thing to Singapore- they even started a salted egg crusted fish skin as local potato chips which are also DELICIOUSLY sinful. Forget about popcorn shrimp- you use egg yolks as the crust?? Holy cow, my arteries are crying but in joy. Would do it again- salty, rich and not super crunchy and overly salty like a potato chip, this is a worth it dish to get. AND NOW.... the chili crab. Bro prepare to get your hands dirty, b/c the point of this dish is to finish that sauce that the crab has taken time to brew and stew in. The crab is delicious, but that chili paste that this thing has been cooking in is a complexly layered seafood chili thing that you must dip the sweet bun into. Better not leave any sauce left b/c it's worth like 1$ a bite on this dish and the sauce is EXCELLENT. Worth getting this. Take a stroll down Clarke's Quay afterwards for a neon lights reflecting on the water, chill bars, and the singapore Marina Sands Hotel reflecting across the waterways.",

This is all I eat here and will ever eat here because I can't get anything anywhere else that tastes as good as these dishes do here.If, like me, your companion doesn't eat seafood and is allergic to shellfish, there are limited options.That being said, I always get the Black Pepper crab. And I eat the whole thing! Sometimes I've had two, but they were pressed for the table so one had to do this time... This is by far the BEST Black Pepper crab you can get in Singapore. I've had Black Pepper crab in other restaurants (non-Jumbo). I have tried, White Pepper crab and nothing comes even close to the heavenly, yummy, deliciousness that is Black Pepper crab from Jumbo. I tried the Chili Crab, but for me the the Chili hides the taste of the crab, whereas the Black Pepper enhances it. In addition, the Chili crab is slightly sweet, which I don't like.Baby KaiLan in Garlic Sauce. OMG, so good! Cooked to the perfect tenderness and crunchiness. Not overly garlicky, in case you are concerned about that. My boyfriend had the Rib Eye with Black Pepper Sauce and he thought that while it wasn't your traditional au Poivre sauce, it was good, especially considering the options.Their house red wine is also pretty good. Don't hesitate.That's all folks. Honestly, this is a MUST if you visit Singapore. They have several other locations, in case Riverside Point is booked. If you go, book and book early to ensure your seat.",

Staff welcomed me with open arms and set me outside. I ordered the Chilli crab ( signature crab dish) and fried rice with eggs. Also, don't forget to get there mini buns so you can suck up all the juice from the Crab! +Beware, they will place nuts on your table that are NOT complimentary! You actually pay for those! If u don't want it send it back. Once i noticed I was paying for them i kindly asked them to remove the nuts off the table and off my bill.Yeah, I know many people talk about how expensive this place is. But honestly, it's all worth it! Fortunately, I was able to get a 15% discount as they were offering that to any Citibank participants. If you have Citibank make sure you bring your card!Beat the crowds and come at night, especially to enjoy the lovely view of Clarke Quay! This is a MUST when visiting Singapore! Until next time, CC!

    "text": "I rarely use the term \"must-try\" but when in Singapore, there are indeed two local specialties that every visitor should try.The first one is the World famous Singapore Chili Crab.A whole large crab already cut into pieces and with the shells cracked open was served in a wok-shaped dish filled with the World's yummiest chili sauce. \u00a0The heat of the chili was moderate, which I think was enough to give the dish a good kick without being overwhelming. \u00a0It was more of a sweet chili sauce that had a tasty and soothing sweetness that was perfect for my palate. \u00a0Using the red hot chili pepper scale that many restaurants use, I would say it was probably 3/5 chili peppers.The sauce was very rich in the natural flavor of the crab meat, and it's a perfect companion of the fried rice that we ordered. \u00a0I could eat that fried rice with the chili sauce all day every day!The crab itself was meaty, juicy and packed with natural yumminess of the sea. \u00a0Wear a bib, get your hands messy and dirty, and savor every bite of the meat that you manage to extract out of the shells.Besides the chili crab, we also ordered a mango and roast duck appetizer. \u00a0The app was a cold salad made with hand pulled (or shredded) roast duck meat, slices of fresh mango and baby cucumbers. \u00a0It was tossed in a sweet and slightly tangy Asian vinaigrette that was close to heavenly.There are plenty of places in Singapore where you can find the famous chili crab. \u00a0But if you are in the gorgeous, vibrant and somewhat romantic Clarke Quay area, Jumbo is the place to go.",

    "text": "Yum yum yum! If you're in Singapore for the first time, second time...maybe third...basically if you're in Singapore you should go here. Chili crab is different from any other crab you're going to have. I grew up in Maryland, we eat crab. We cover it it old bay. We wear bibs and use full rolls of paper towels. But this is different. It comes in skillets, it's spicier, it comes with sides and chili crab sauce. You still use a full roll of paper towels but it's a fancier, Singaporean experience that shouldn't be missed. Besides the experience the crab itself is delicious, succulent and tender. \u00a0Don't over-eat. Let the chili crab be the star. Sit outside, grab a Tiger beer, don't forget to make a reservation and enjoy.",

We had the chili crab, lamb, black pepper crab, mee go reng, steamed fish, seafood fried rice, cereal shrimp, and kang kong. It must be a Singapore thing but all they had on the tables were lemon water, and a wet napkin, no regular napkins.The cereal shrimp was ok. The chili crab was great, until I got to the claw and it tasted like ammonia. The fried rice and mee go reng were by far my favorite. Well, I did it. I did the touristy thing and tried the chili crab. The sauce was really good, just wish the claw didn't taste like ammonia.",

Seriously, they are a staple in the country, and have an amazing experience for most.We had a large party of folks - this is the Achilles Heel of this joint. They squeeze an insane number of people in here, and don't really care about how comfortable you are. There's my negative for the review - that's it. ;)The food is amazing. We had the Chilli Crab, the Black Pepper crab, spicy seafood noodles, and lots of snacks. Please trust me - they k ow what they're doing! These guys make amazing dishes, and are widely known for them. Go, pig out, and don't complain about the bill. ;)",

I wanted to go to Clarke Quay anyway and am glad I made the choice. They were lines of people waiting to be seated but the system was very organized and the wait was less than five minutes. I snagged a seat outside with views of the water. Service was excellent. The table was preset with peanuts (they charge you extra for this but don't tell you beforehand) Jasmine tea, and anything you could need for eating seafood. I Perused the menu but ultimately succumbed to the classic chili crab. First I started off with a glass of tiger beer. This was refreshing and a good way to cool off from the humidity outside. \u00a0I had my seafood eating bib, utensils, and disposable gloves (I had seen other diners using this and I am so glad that I requested them). My chili crab was brought out very shortly. \u00a0It was \u00a0everything it's been \"cracked up\" to be. The sauce was heavenly, The crab was super fresh. I \u00a0ordered some steamed buns to soak up the fantastic sauce. Word of advice: this dish is very messy regardless of how well you prepare. Even the gloves and bib won't keep you from making a mess; so make sure there are no cameras around lolService was excellent.While somewhat pricey, this was the best meal I had in Singapore.",

    "text": "When visiting Singapore, one must try the chili crab!! Heard about this popular place from a few local friends and decided to check it out. If you are planning to eat here, I highly recommend putting in reservations way beforehand. Once you get your RSVP secured, do make sure to show up on time or else you will lose your spot to the other hungry individuals who are waiting around and trying to get in without needing a RSVP.Once seated, it's time to put on some bibs and feast. Highly recommend ordering chili crab!! For a party of 3-4, one chili crab is enough to feed everyone. With the abundance of chili, I suggest getting a couple of side dishes since eating the crab itself isn't too filling if you're hungry. For the side dishes, I recommend getting the scallop appetizers plus rice or noodles. The scallop appetizers itself was a very unique dish. Crispy with taro on the outside and hot and soft on the inside, this is definitely yummy and different. As for the fried rice we got, it wasn't anything too stellar but it went well with the leftover chili once the crab meat was gone. We also ordered the recommended fried mini buns but found it to be quite underwhelming in comparison to most of the food that was ordered. NOTHING IS FREE, so do keep in mind that if you drink the tea on the table, or touch those small plates of peanuts, you will have to pay for it. Tricky tricky, I know. Even asking for water will equal to you paying for it. Service overall was quick and efficient. Every table has a time limit, so do observe the time. Also, this place does take credit card and can split bills which is a nice plus =]",

Out of the two quays I would recommend Clarke Quay due to the beautiful view overlooking the Singapore River - outdoors dining is a must!Crabs are priced per Kg - one crab will decently feed 2 people and will set you back $75-85. The Chilli crab was one of the best things I had in Singapore. It was huge, meaty & oh so tasty! The sauce was absolutely delicious which brings me to my next pint - order the buns!! You need something to soak up the beautiful sauce and these little buns won't disappoint. The experience itself is quite memorable including putting on your bib - devouring crabs is messy work!",

The chili crab was full of flavor with a mix of spicy and sweet. It was a bit spicy for my liking to enjoy it fully. The price for two crabs and a can of soda, came out to about $150 US dollars. Yes, pricey for my standards but again you come to say you've eaten the chili crab at Jumbo Seafood. \u00a0After all, we figured, this may be our only time in Singapore. Live it up!",
