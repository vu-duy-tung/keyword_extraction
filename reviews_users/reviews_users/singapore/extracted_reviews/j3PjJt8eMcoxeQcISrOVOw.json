    "text": "Mouth-Watering Food, Wide Variety, Reasonable Price!This is definitely one of my favourite place for mala steamboat! The restaurant is decorated with many oriental elements such as the Chinese red lanterns hanging at the sides of the restaurant, numerous Chinese inscriptions, wooden tables and chairs, and traditional Chinese utensils. They have 4 types of condiments available for us to mix. 3 types of broth for steamboat and we had the chicken and of course the ma-la. We had the lunch buffet and there were a large variety of food for us to order and it was fresh. We ordered many many plates of fish paste, veg, meats, fish and others.Sweet and Savoury Tidbits - each person is serve a set of tidbits such as dumplings, xiao long bao, Egg Coated Glutinous Square, Fried Roll Buns, Water Chestnut Jelly & eight Treasures \"Black Rice\" or Mixed Fruits in Syrup.Overall, this steamboat is reasonably priced for the wide food range and superior quality. Service is generally decent but when the restaurant is fully packed, the staff might get busy and forget your orders. Otherwise, they are generally prompt and courteous. Worth a try!

    "text": "Two out of three ain't bad.The room is relatively nice. \u00a0The main room is definitely nicer than the back room that we were seated in. \u00a0This room was a little cramped. \u00a0There are some nice accents that provide an ornamental feel to the ambiance. \u00a0This is a step up from the purely functional feel of my hot pot places.The food was very good. \u00a0So, there are the two positives. \u00a0Then there is the negative.The service ranged from functional to downright rude. \u00a0They pretty much do the steps they plan to and when they plan to do them. \u00a0Outside of that, they seem pretty put out if you ask for anything. \u00a0Plus, come on a buck for a glass of tap water. \u00a0Now, that doesn't make any sense.However, whether you call it steamboat or whether you call it hot pot, the food was very good.Our soup was half mild and half sort of spicy. \u00a0My friend does not like really spicy food so we couldn't go all out on the spicy side.tinyurl.com/95lyapeWe pretty much went with the scattergun method. We ordered one of the sets. \u00a0Plus, we picked a number of other things from the ala carte menu. \u00a0We had a little bit of everything. \u00a0My favorites were the mushrooms, the beef, and the prawns. \u00a0But, everything that went into that soup pretty much came out good. \u00a0tinyurl.com/9a5dk8ktinyurl.com/8zhrsqptinyurl.com/9uhrk95tinyurl.com/9o8uue2Well, the one exception for me was the frozen mussels. \u00a0I am not a hot pot pro. \u00a0I would not have thought of ordering mussels for hot pot. \u00a0I certainly would not have expected them to be frozen and really had no idea what we should do with them. \u00a0We overcooked them. \u00a0I do not think I will be revisiting the idea of mussels in steamboat. \u00a0If you can overlook the service and focus on the fun of cooking your own food and it being very tasty, then give The Magic of Chongqing Hot Pot a chance. \u00a0I enjoyed it. \u00a0If there were not so many other steamboats to explore in Singapore, I would return.",

    "text": "They charged us for edamame we didn't order. It was brought to the table when we sat down. Later showed up on our bill for $3. We didn't order it, we complained. They said we were supposed to return it if we didn't wanted, then pointed to the whole buffet menu and said, see, it's not on the buffet menu. As if we could possibly scrutinize all 50 items and see that edamame wasn't included. Where I come from, if an item is given to you without you asking in a restaurant, it's free.They also charge you $1 for cold tap water to drink. Yes, you are charged $1 for tap water. At least they gave us refills free of charge!All of this might be forgivable if the food was good. Unfortunately, the soup base was extremely salty and bereft of actual flavor. The fish slices we ordered were tough.Online, they advertised their dinner buffet as being $37.90 per adult. That's what the menu said too. But the night we went wasn't particularly busy, and they said, for whatever reason, that it would be $39.90 tonight. At least they mentioned that *before* the bill came.",

    "text": "When I want to have a hot pot in some comfort with my mates, this is the place that comes to mind.Chong Qing hot pot is great if you have a group of rowdy friends that wanna celebrate an event, maybe a birthday and feel like having some steamboat. This place is only fun if you have enough people to book a private room. Only then, is it worth while. Make sure you ring in advance for a room booking!This place is kind of pricey for simple steam boat. The quality varies from time to time but it's never bad. It ranges from good to pretty good. As with most hot pot places there's a variety of soup bases to choose from (I like the herb and Ma La Chilli oil). The fun part is to have the comfort of air conditioning and a room where you can have your own private little hot pot party. You can make as much noise as you want!Being a ala carte buffet all you can eat style restaurant, the usual is thrown in, some special dishes that's one per person and a dessert (the man tou is good). Good company and the private room is key here!",

    "text": "This place is just awesome and I would definitely come back here again. The steamboat soup is just so flavourful, and that's even before you start throwing in the ingredients, so you can imagine just how good it tastes after adding in prawns, fish and the like. Definitely have not tasted anything as good in other steamboat restaurants in Singapore.The condiments and sauces which they serve go really well with the meat, fish and prawns.As they are really good, come prepared to pay slightly more than you would expect to pay for a typical steamboat restaurant (like those in Bugis) but overall still very value-for-money because the quality truly trumps other places.If you have a big group of around 10 people you can request the private dining area for a more cosy, intimate group gathering.",

    "text": "Tried and tested favourite hotpot destinationHaving been put off by one too many seamy, questionably insalubrious, budget-priced hotpot restaurants (inevitably recommended by an enthusiastic friend), it's always a relief to come back to ChongQing where the quality is assured. All at the princely buffet price of ~$20 for lunch and ~$30 for dinner. I prefer the Tanglin outlet over the more modern and brisk one at Suntec, here the pace is comfortable and friendly, with servers comprising Chinese girls and local 'aunties'. Making at least 4-5 visits a year, dining at ChongQing has a happy familiar routine. First, mix the special sauces that will reduce the sting of the mala soup - it's a mix of sesame paste, sesame oil, garlic+chilli, and sweet chilli. Then start cooking your favourite vegetables and dumplings in the soups - mine is usually the milk bone chicken and mala. While many at least 90 minutes in contentment as the food keeps flowing - prawns and pork belly are part of the buffet menu too, if I recall correctly. Enjoy cooked items in addition, and part of dessert is usually the eagerly awaited fried mantou bun dipped in condensed milk.",

Staff and service very kind and attentive. Attention should be paid to behave moderate and not to disturb the (mostly) chinese clientele, this is not a place for loud group parties!",
