I had a lovely cup of skinny latte, which had a chocolatey, roasted and creamy profile that was right up my alley. For the food, I had the sunny lovin. It was a generous smear of avocado guacamole on TOP each half of the English muffin and topped with a poached egg. Was under seasoned but nothing a pinch of salt didn't fix.",

It's a bit small and can get crowded, but they tables to sit at and enjoy your breakfast with table service after ordering at the counter and they have high chairs as well. They don't have a kids menu, and their food portions are rather large. The coffee is good, the chalkboard showing all the different coffees is GREAT, you can get an coffeducation while waiting for your drink, maybe even change up your next order. The coffee price and portion seems a bit expensive, compared to Starbucks, but about on par for small neighborhood coffee shops. They have free filtered water at a self service station, which is always a major plus for me.Convenient parking in the Siglap V garage down below as well.",

    "text": "This is a place I drive by everyday. Either on the way to work or on the way home. What always attracts me is the soft lighting and the wood furniture. It gives me a very calm and soft feeling. So decided to finally give it a try. Walked in and was greeted by the staff. Nothing short of what you'll expect at cafes nowadays. Didn't bother to look at the menu, as I feel to operate a cafe, a good coffee is always necessary. So I got myself a iced latte and a cappuccino. Took a whiff of the coffee, and it was strong. I remembered I had something so strong was back when I was in Greece. But once you mix in the milk and the espresso together. It became a symphony of flavours. The coffee they use are a little more towards the acidic side. I love the flavours that linger in my mouth. For me this is indeed one of the best coffees in Singapore. And what I love is that this is a no frills place. No pretentious staff and decor. It's nice, pleasant on the eyes and it relaxes my soul! Yes! Even with my coffee, it doesn't take long before I start feeling like I need a nap. So when you're around the area, do drop by for your cuppa.",

And I was not disappointed.I had their Fruity Buttermilk Waffle ($15-$16) and a regular sized Chai Latte ($5). It took a while for the waffle to come out but it was definitely worth the wait. The waffle was topped with bananas, blueberries and strawberries along with maple syrup. It was superb! Also, the Chai Latte was one of the best Chai Latte's i've had in Singapore. My first Chai Latte was in Tokyo's Dean and Deluca and nothing has lived up to their standards. But this did. I was delighted to have finally found a place which serves good Chai Latte. ahahahaOn the downside, I wished they had a few comfy chairs so I could chill there with a book and also served muffins!!However, the atmosphere was real cosy, perfect for working or studying! :)",

    "text": "I literally drive past this caf\u00e9 every single day after work. The fact that this place is just a 7-min drive from my home, questions my sanity. Every time my car stops at the stoplight at the T-junction facing Siglap V, I contemplate. \"Should I go? Should I not go?\" I have read too many positive reviews about the caf\u00e9 that it made me super curious and intrigued. So yes. Curiosity finally slaughtered the cat in me. I gave in and went today; along with my two willing colleagues.Why didn't I come here sooner? Why? Why?!! Every single thing we ordered were brilliant. I ordered a glass of their Butterscotch Latte, whilst the rest of the food were shared amongst us three. We ordered Cinnamon Churros Ice Cream, Milo Dinosaur Waffles and Salted Caramel Pavlova. Fwoah!! If that's not enough sugar rush for you, I don't know what will.I think these were the best churros I've had so far. They tasted really crunchy and authentic. You could really taste the perfect cinnamon flavour. They were served in a glass with a scoop of chocolate-drizzled vanilla ice-cream in between.As for the pavlova, I opted it since I saw the words, 'Salted Caramel' plastered onto it. I love salted caramel. Watching the staff cut a slice off the pavlova with a big knife was an enthralling watch. Haha! My colleague and I had our eyes glued. The meringue was baked into perfection. Even the caramel was brilliant.Moving onto our chocolate waffle, this was served to us the last. Firstly, I have to applaud on the presentation. Loved the mini marshmallows that were used as toppings. So cute! They had a dollop of vanilla ice-cream in the middle, topped with Milo powder. Another thumbs-up from all of us. Although, one of my colleagues commented that it would have been nicer if the waffle was a bit spongier.Overall, we loved the desserts. All of us ended up feeling contented after the sugary meal; no thanks to the stress at work. The service too was commendable. The lovely staff girls were all very friendly and considerate enough to tell us that the cakes are all Halal (supplied by a young local Malay baker, Farah H. Affandi -- go google her cake creations!).And oh! Parking slots are available at 3 convenient places. You may either park your vehicles at the basement carpark of the building itself, the lots behind the building, or the basement carpark at Siglap Centre located right across.For now, I think a hot glass of green tea is in order!",

    "text": "Can't complain about the lack of coffee spots in the East anymore with so many sprouting like mushrooms! I actually visited Craftsmen Specialty Coffee at Siglap V, just opposite Siglap Centre, when they first opened (that was months back). Well, it took this long because well.. it's just another cafe... who gets its beans from somewhere else, and in this case from Dutch Colony Coffee Co., which opened its outpost a few streets down... And as the story goes....First, the coffee. The Craftsmen blend is 40% El Salvador Finca El Carmen, 30% Ethiopia Konga natural Yirgacheffe and 30% Sumatra Triple Picked Mandheling. You get balanced notes with a hint of ripe lemon and dark chocolate finish. The coffee was bold and robust, just the way i like it. Drinks are in the $4-$5 range. Our latte and flat white were both $4.50 each. To differentiate itself, Craftsmen also has a brew bar which does V60, Chemex, Siphon, Woodneck and French Press coffees ($6-$8). \u00a0You can also get your hands on the usual coffee making products- Hario, Bodum blahblah.Food wise, we weren't impressed. Quiches ($9) and sandwiches ($15-16) are made in house. We had the Pulled Pork sandwich ($15), which was MEH. The meat wasn't seasoned well. It tastes of meat that's bland and tough. Where's the spice man? The choice of bread was also kinda off with a thin waxy brown skin and a strange center with a chewy pull. Well because the meat was so dry, it remained separated from the bread.Thankfully, they chose the right cake and pastry supplier, Fathis, who apparently supplies to many cafes (i can't be sure of that) but anyhoo, i was thoroughly impressed with their moist and chunky banana walnut bread with a dollop of of cream cheese frosting. Other cakes available include a Salted Caramel Popcorn and Blueberry Cheesecake, and they look really hearty!So well, head over to Craftsmen for coffee and a piece of cake if you're in the area. After all, it beats having the usual Coffee Club mudpie, or Udders ice cream.",

Though young lady serving me tried to entice me with an early dinner, I wasn't put off by her attempt. Wasn't disappointed with my cappuccino. One of the better ones I have had. Was lucky to be there for their not so often made Banana Upside Down cake. Nothing fancy, but the taste and texture - pure comfort. It was delish!Would I return to try their mains?

After a temporary closure due to staff training, Craftsmen Specialty Coffee, which specializes in coffee and cakes, had a reopening just few days ago.Besides from the food options, they also have appliances for sale here.Dutch Colony Coffee Co.'s blends are used here. The Flat White ($4.50) tasted strong and firm, yet has a low acidity that everyone can enjoy.The bakes and pastries here are supplied by online bakery Fathiscakes and Bonheur Pattiserie. The Salted Caramel Popcorn ($8.90), one of the cakes baked by Fathiscakes, is firm and satisfying. The caramel taste is just right; flavourful and not too sweet. Add a pinch of salt with popcorns on every mouthful and this will became a delightful cake to have.The location also meant that it is a quiet respite for people to relax with a cup of coffee or to study in during the day. With its reopening, the Siglap / East Coast area has now yet another cafe to be added to its list.",

The good people at Craftsmen use Dutch Colony beans, which are one of my favourite beans (apart from Sumatran!). The many times I've been here, I've never been let down by their coffee thus far - I recommend their cappuccino, their lattes, their mocha - heck, try it all.Food wise, nothing that special. I've tried their poached eggs on english muffin, wasn't wow'd by it. However, I haven't really tried much else so don't be deterred by that. My only irk is that due to the interior decor (minimalistic, high ceilings, enclosed), it tends to get rather noisy and sound echoes a lot.I'm still a sucker for their coffee ;)",
