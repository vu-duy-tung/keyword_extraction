    "text": "Dolce Tokyo is located near Uniqlo.. Find Uniqlo, and you will find Dolce Tokyo.. It is run by the more familiar, MOF, Ministry of Food, as an upmarket Japanese-Italian hipster cafe. When you first walk in you, you will notice the bird cages with pictures of sliced cakes, and as you walk up to the cake display, you will see the huge slices of cakes!! :) It's so hard to resist the cakes, especially with them glowing in the display. I tried the Green tea cake with goma sesame. for $11.50++ a slice, it's definitely not wallet friendly, but I enjoyed it sooo much!!! :) The sponge is soft, and the black sesame gives it a slight sweetness and the green tea crumbs on the top, adds a crunchy aspect to the cake. I love it soooo much!.. but to fork out $11.50++ for another slice..... I couldn't do it again. So I went on to try a main..I had the japanese curry with smoked salmon on a hotplate.. it was $14++.. It was sizzling hot.. the curry itself tasted like the normal instant curry cubes that you can buy from NTUC Finest.. Not that fantastic.. I actually felt quite thirsty after that.. MSG..??? Nonetheless, I felt that they were quite generous with the smoked salmon!! YAY!! 5 stars! and there were potatoes, carrots, veggies and baby tomatoes in there. A decent dish to finish the meal.. OOOps. i started with the dessert and ended with a main dish lol.",

    "text": "I though Dolce Tokyo was a franchise of the same name shop in Shibuya Japan but it is not. Like its Italian-Japanese fusion name \"Dolce Tokyo\", this cafe is an intriguing mix of Japanese and Western sensibilities. \u00a0For instance, Dolce Tokyo does different takes on the classic egg ben. But when it comes to smoked salmon vs unagi, it would be unagi anytime. I could not be any more excited to dig into this decadent Unagi Egg Benedict ($20). \u00a0The teriyaki-style grilled unagi came in substantial portion to match the cheese, poached egg and tangy hollandaise sauce on toasted bread. If you are one who always go for the usual egg ben, why not give this a try? Seems to be only available here :)  We settled for the Pork Belly Curry Toji Set $17, which includes Fried Rice, Miso Soup and a choice of skewer. The Pork Belly Curry Toji came bubbling non-stop with rich cubes of soft, simmered pork belly, which are tasty and satisfying, if not as mouthwatering tender as they should be. Besides the usual onions, carrots and potatoes, Dolce Tokyo upped the ante by using cherry tomatoes and wolfberries (goji) to sweeten the curry. \u00a0But luckily, the light-brown roux did not wander off into the sweet track and went very well with the fried rice, which was cleverly elevated in taste by the use of Japanese short grains. Served in a bird cage, the signature Matcha Black Sesame Cake ($11.50) is a welcome change to the usual matcha-red bean duo. The matcha flavour does not hit one instantly, but creeps in gradually behind the sweet black sesame paste. When it comes to desserts/pastries, Japan produces excellent ones but it is unlikely that one can find a dessert bento there. So the dessert bento at Dolce Tokyo version is quite rare and fits the fickle-minded. Everything was not too sweet but the abekawa (rice mochi) was over-toasted and resembled asteroid rocks. Desserts are front and center here, but there are plenty of other delicious options, much of which devoted to the Japanese \"soul food\" Personally, I thought the savoury dishes were more memorable than the sweets. Prices are not eminently affordable but no one will say \"no\" if you want to treat yourself to a dessert or two.",

    "text": "For full review and more pics, visit my blog!It seems like Japanese themed malls are all the rage these days. Just along Orchard Road there's the entire atrium at Plaza Singapura and now 313 Somerset has recently revamped its level 3 to house all things Nihon in terms of food and fashion. Taking over the terribly overpriced Blue Mountain is Japanese Italian Cafe Dolce Tokyo which serves an extensive variety of Japanese sweets, as well as other savory dishes.With more than 50 variations of tea and coffee at Dolce Tokyo, ranging from lattes, frappes to shakes, it is no wonder why Dolce Tokyo is the perfect spot for shoppers to rest their feet after shopping, or for those looking for a sweet something to conclude their meal. I would say that the cafe is really more Japanese than Italian. Don't go expecting pasta or pizzas as sandwiches and crostinis are the Italiano representatives here. The Mixed Crostini Platter ($18) consists of the tomato concasse with chilled shrimps, salmon roe, tamagoyaki, smoked salmon (we had parma ham instead). Mix and match your own. These are pretty good for sharing and i love the crispy grilled multigrain bread that is from their central kitchen.All day breakfast is also served here but i'm not impressed with the food. My advice? Stick to the Japanese dishes. The Hiyashi Chuka ($17/19) is one of our favorite dishes of the night. Cold Somen with strips of tamago, cucumber, carot, ginger, ikura, gammon ham, nori, wolfberries and shrimps; drizzled with a light sesame sauce. I can never say no to cold Japanese noodles. It's so easy on the palate I could finish it all. If you like Curry Rice, the one at Dolce Tokyo is pretty decent and rich in flavor. Each order (original $16; omu rice $19) comes with a stick of skewer (choose from a selection of 4). The Teriyaki Pork Belly skewer is well marinated and tenderly braised just like the chinese kong ba. The 3 side dishes changes daily; we had the baby octopus, potato salad and marinated jellyfish. Another hit with us.I'm quite a fan of the Unagi Fried Rice served in a hotstone bowl ($20). This comes with a skewer as well. Flavorful fried Japanese pearl rice which is slightly sticky and fluffy. Good quality unagi, comparable to any decent Japanese restaurant, was served. My favorite part of the dish has got to be the crispy burnt rice at the bottom. Crunchy!Now on to desserts. I absolutely adore the Green Tea with Goma Sesame cake. This is moist and light and rich in the black goma and matcha flavors. The matcha-goma crumble on top really takes the cake, literally and figuratively. I would have this anytime. Highly recommended. The Dolce Tokyo's signature Dessert Bento ($18.90) is a combination of desserts in tasting portions. It's a little haphazard and none of the above impressed me. I ate all that kantan jelly even though it was tasteless because i was told it will improve my complexion. Beauty be the death of me. Located at Level 3 of 313 Somerset next to popular Japanese fashion stores Uniqlo and Lowry's Farm, Dolce Tokyo is a relaxing spot for customers to wind down and mingle with friends over a nice meal or cakes. Give it a shot. Follow my recommendations and you won't go wrong.",

    "text": "I found the hiyashi chuka ($15 for the basic without prawn/skewer) to be just okay/normal.. Maybe cos my friends were both having toji/curry toji sets, which looked a lot more interesting! Or perhaps because I used to make hiyashi chuka at home and hence wasn't anything particularly special. It's basically cold somen with shredded egg, ham, cucumbers, carrots, pickled radish and ginger, with a cold sesame soy sauce poured over (or dipped in). I found the ginger a bit disconcerting and radish too. Sauce was not bad tho! And still gobbled up everything. My friends' toji sets were pretty gd I think, friend #1 had a pork sausage toji set, and friend #2 had a curry prawn set. Both came with garlic prawn skewers, three small side dishes (baby octopus, jellyfish, and potato salad), miso soup, and fried rice (I think it was fried rice, not normal rice). Each set cost ~$21, as I recall. Cheryl N's full blog review described the toji as sukiyaki style and that is certainly accurate! Quite deliciously soupy and eggy.Service was so-so, waiters were somewhat busy. AND they were trying to chase us out by putting the bill down before we'd asked for it, I guess cos there were people waiting in line for dessert on a Friday night. Anyhow, we defied them and ordered dessert. Friend #2 actually ordered the dessert so I don't know what it's called on the menu, but it had a trio of ice cream (vanilla, choc, matcha) with 2 marshmallows, 1 oreo cookie garnishing the top, 2 brownie cubes, 2 sesame tangyuans, and 2 slices of peach. Rather strange that there was 2 of each topping given that there were 3 scoops of ice cream. Anyhow... I found the ice cream to be too sweet, especially the vanilla. Choc was not too bad, matcha was probably the least sweet. But Tsujiri wins hands down anytime for matcha ice cream!Might be back for fried rice/toji set, and their cakes look interesting, but not a top choice! Except that on Friday night at 7:45pm+ it wasn't too crowded for dinner.",

Nothing special about it too..the rice wasn't even flavored nicely. The unagi don at Nana's green tea is way better, and you get much more unagi. Also, this dish took forever to come out even though they weren't that busy. Their matcha green tea tasted like a melted matcha soft serve, without any strong matcha flavor. I also got one of their jelly fruit desserts (shown in the photo), also nothing special about this. Tasted like cheap jelly I could buy a pack of from the grocery store and they also used canned peaches.",
