    "text": "Yomenya Goemon combines my two most favourite cuisine into a single dish! What's not the love!?!?They have many to choose from but my absolute favourite has to be their Mediterranean Seafood Spaghetti! It's creamy with tomato base in it so again, another combination of both my favourite italian sauces, full of fresh seafood! I'm salivating just writing about this! My friends ordered other pastas and I've tried them. They are nice enough but nothing beats my Mediterranean Seafood Spaghetti.They serve their pasta with a side of salad that is dressed in their own special tangy yet refreshing sauce. Very appetising indeed. I am definitely a fan!",

    "text": "3.5 stars reviewCame here on a Sunday evening and was thinking that it will be crowded from the church service but was wrong.Got us seated pretty fast and was the first customer even though we arrived around 5.45pm. Instead of looking at the normal menu, I decided to go for their special menu - lobster bisque spaghetti.Service wasn't really great here even though there were quite a number of staffs and was seated at the worse corner (I had to fight against the glass wall while consuming my dish). Had a hard time talking to my ex-tutor and her husband too due to the constraint from the seating area.Food came around 10 minutes after we ordered. Decided to go Ala Carte for each one of us. The color of my dish was of bright dark orange which looked appetizing at first glance (I do look at food colors too when choosing food). Took a picture before digging in.Was given three small pieces of lobster meats. Love the sauce as it was flavorful. Besides that, the spaghetti was pretty soft. Safe to say that I picked the right food :) Food wise, I will give a 4 star for the lobster bisque spaghetti.Overall, will be back here with a smaller group of people (not 6) so that I can get a better seating arrangement. Will probably try out other \"limited edition\" food choices the next round.",

Pastas from hawker centre western food stalls at about quarter the price would put this rendition to shame. The better pastas such as those with roe are average at best. The fact that the spaghetti itself is tasteless shows that they have no clue what they are doing.",

The pasta sauces are pretty good, but there are some that are much better than others. The carbonara with meat sauce and onsen egg is my favorite so far. Other than that, the rest of the cream sauces were a little one-note to me. The avocado oil sauce and mentai sauce were pretty good, just not very note-worthy. A good place to go if you are craving pasta.",
