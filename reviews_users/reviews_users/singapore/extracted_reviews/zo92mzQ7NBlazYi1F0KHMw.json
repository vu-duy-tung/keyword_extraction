    "text": "Fabulous! Gunther's *modern french* dining certainly lives up to its name. I had Gunther's when it first opened a long time ago & i'm glad to be back again tonight. Signature dishes:Angel hair pasta with caviar. Back then this signature dish was all the rage and it still tastes just as good. Light & heavy flavors at the same time to match perfectly with a nice champagne.The foie gras with crushed almonds & hibiscus sauce is a classic & it's return to the menu is a welcome return. Again, light & heavy flavors will match with a nice burgundy or red. Apple tart is not in the photos i uploaded but it is another must try dish. Light flaky crunchy crust matches very well with a light apple filling that won't overwhelm your stomach but is a very welcome end to one's meal & palette. Today's dishes that i had that were memorable... actually they were all great!Onion cheese gratin - a very french influenced dish using onion, the texture & sweetness of the onion is brought out nicely. Langoustine meuniere - full of prawn flavor yet it is very very light. It is sliced very thinly so the gamey taste of raw prawn is not overpowering but its sweetness is brought out, nicely balanced with the cream & caviar.Carabinero gambas prawn - Gunther's is very capable to do a sharing portion for 2 tonight. The 2 spoonfuls of tomato & slightly spicy rice is full of flavor. The prawn is cooked just right with some tasty roe. It's head & brains is cooked to perfection! Pork Belly & Coquille Pasta - Very large portions for sharing. The pork belly is very fulfilling, comforting & satisfying to one's belly. The sauce would match well with a margaux or burgundy! I was feeling very full at this point BUT dessert beckons!For dessert, crepe suzette that was also shared between me & my guest. Gunther's staff will put on a nice show to flambe the crepe's in front of you. The orange sauce is tangy served with an equally tasy ice cream & light crepes that is nicely burnt in a few places. Ambience:Gunther's decor is very simple but its ambience is quite quiet & there are not many tables that adds to the exclusivity of dining here. This is a nice place for a romantic dinner for two.Price: Special's & seasonal items can be quite expensive but given that gunther's is willing to do sharing portions & some dishes are large portions, at least one's belly will not go hungry after the meal. As always, lunch is the best time to go for value for money. Monday's & tuesday are corkage free which adds tremendously to gunther's value. Service:The ratio of servers to each table is approximately 1 to 1-2 tables depending on how booked Gunther's is. Every staff is friendly and willing to explain anything. I recommend Mogish who is a long time staff to take good care you. Overall: Gunther's has been fabulous. My guest was equally delighted. Each dish is a nice gastronomical surprise & a nice refresh of memories from my first dining experience at gunther's. I will return soon! Thanks chef & team!!!",

Located in the middle of the shophouses, next to its sister restaurant Garibaldi Italian Restaurant & Bar, another equally well known restaurant. Although the restaurant is quite high end with its equally expensive priced menu, it offers quite a reasonable priced 3 course lunch set at $38++ which is available on weekday.The restaurant is decorated in grey with paintings and dim lights around which gives an elegant setting. Besides the usual menu, the staff also make his offers on what is in season by using a \"daily special cart\". Today there is vegetables from Japan, lamb, wagyu beef, and assorted seafood such king crab, scallop. But the one which holds everyone's attention is the truffle. Even when covers in a glass cover, one can easily smells the earthy pungent smell.Before starting the meal, one is served with hot towel to wipe with. One is served with a pipping warm mini buguette and butter to start the meal. Though the bread looks hard, it is quite crispy and soft to texture.For today's lunch set, there is 3 choices for starter : Farmer's salad, Clear vegetable soup, and Braised Portobello mushroom, sunny side up egg. Braised Portobello mushroom, sunny side up eggThe mushroom is quite well flavoured.Next is the main which also comes with 3 choices : Gunther's Creation (seafood pasta), Braised lamb stew, Leffe beer, and Charcoal grilled Wagyu steak (additional S$20++).Cold Angel hair pasta, Oscietra caviar ($60++)However I decide to go with the staff's recommendation to topup $40++ more to change the main course to the restaurant's signature cold pasta dish. It is quite popular which could be found in most tables. Refreshing cold and smells great of truffle which makes one high before eating.The last course is the dessert which also comes with 3 choices : Dessert of the Day (Pineapple Panna Cotta), Cheese Platter (additional S$10++), and Fine apple tart \"\u00e0 la drag\u00e9es\", Havana rum raisin ice cream (additional S$8++).Fine apple tart \"\u00e0 la drag\u00e9es\", Havana rum raisin ice cream ($25++)The apple tart is different from the traditional apple tart. It looks more like a flat pizza. Thin slices of soft caramelised apple on a very thin base. Crunchy and crispy on the outside. The ice cream is rich and creamy. Pairing the cold ice cream and the warm apple tart together is quite a yummy combination.Lastly there is coffee or tea and Petit fours to end the meal with.The coffee is quite rich with a slight bitter and chocolaty taste. I have it with just milk and without sugar. It is just nice to balance with the sweetness from the dessert and petit fours. The petit fours consists of Financier, Canele, Wafer and chocolate. I like the canel, which has a soft and tender custard center with a dark, thick caramelized crust.Overall the food is quite delicious. The place is packed even it is a weekday lunch time. Although the restaurant is busy, its Chef Gunther still make an effort to visit the tables.",

    "text": "Came here three years ago for our anniversary and after a great time here, we recently revisited when my mom was in town again. This time around, there was NO set menu- it's all a la carte, with an exception of $250/person chef's degustation \"surprise\" menu which we opted for. We weren't disappointed, and their signature caviar pasta still lingers in my palette and memory days after our visit. But I'm not sure if it justified the high price tag ($880 for 3 pax). D and I thought it was a bit pricey for its location and mundane decor (small room with not much decor and no view) and were a bit annoyed that it only offered one set menu or nothing at all and having to go a la carte, as we like the surprises of set courses in fine dining. In comparison, Les Amis offers courses in the range of $150~250 and Jaan $190~$299, which also has sophisticated and lovely decor and an amazing view, respectively, as an added plus.Service was great as always, and every dish was delish (with an exception to truffle that we thought lacked much flavor) so no regrets. But not sure if we'd return again.",

    "text": "No matter where I am, I always have this thing about Lunch Specials! Gunther's Modern French Cuisine is one of the Top 20 restaurants in The Miele Guide with Set Dinner Menu at a price tag of SPD$ 128++. The SPD$38++ lunch set menu for sure sounded like a bargain.Purvis Street where Gunther's located is quite interesting. The business/restaurants here has this mix of the different cuisine of traditional VS modern, new VS old, local VS international. The co existence of all these restaurants is just how Singapore is as a whole.Gunther's is smallish with just a handful of tables so reservations is highly recommended.There are a couple of choices for Appetizer and Main, and \u00a0I decided on the following:Green Asparagus with Ravioli Foie Gras - I just could not resist when I saw foie gras on the menu. The sauce really complimented the Foie Gras as I cleaned my dish with the warm baguette. The asparagus was cooked perfectly with just the right crunch.Oven roasted cod, b\u00e9arnaise sauce - I found it is just OK, average the most. The Tempura vegetables lack the crispness and off the fryer freshness. Dessert of the Day - Earl Grey Pudding - which is really really good! Light, Smooth and with just the right amount of sweetness!Followed by Petite Four and ended with a cappuccino.The Chef also gave me a taste of their Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Oscietra Caviar - All I can say is CAVIAR! This suppose to be their signature appetizer and I have to say it is Excellent!! Refreshing and light and \u00a0Truffle Oil!! CAVIAR!!Services is attentive and professional. Great Food! Great Value! Lunch Specials ROCKS!",

The cauliflower appetizer with purple mustard and a strip of bacon came together nicely and the flavors complimented each other well - the mild sweetness of the cauliflower with the smoky saltiness of the bacon and bitterness of the mustard. Chocolate ice cream came with creme anglaise and three segments of mandarin. The apple tart seemed German, flat and shaped like a pizza slice with carmelized sugar on top with rum raisin ice cream on the side.Epic.Also, it is a legitimately fancy restaurant. I felt underdressed in jeans.",

    "text": "I have heard rave reviews about Gunther's for a very long time. The name just keep on coming across my ears for years; but for some reason, I just never ended up there. We're not completely sure what made us go there, but we decided to go there to celebrate our 2nd anniversary.I had the truffle soup for my starter and it was up to standard. It was creatively served with pumpkin veloute; I think they match well. Le wife had \"Floating island of champignons de Paris\" which is basically consomme, with thinly sliced mushrooms. It was disappointing tbh. The dish was completely lacking and just too plain.The second course was the star of the night. I had the scampi carpaccio, cream, caviar and it just blew my mind. I'm a fan of a simple-dish-done-well and this dish was executed to perfection. The ingredients were fresh and the cream compliments the caviar perfectly without overpowering it. Le wife had what I think was their signature dish, the cold angel hair with caviar. It's not a unique dish, but again, the execution was spot on.The third dish was decent. I'm a big fan of prawn so I decided to go for the carabinero gambas, which is basically those red prawns from the Mediterranean Sea. It was not the best one that I've ever had, but it was still ok. It was slightly overcooked for me, and there was some tomato risotto that just felt out of place. Le wife had bamboo clam with black truffle.The main course was another dish that I love. We shared the roasted rack of pata negra pig. At first bites, I thought it was just a mediocre pork chop. But the after taste of the pork was just superb, I feel like this is a very deep and mature dish that you just can't stop eating. Heck, I even took 1/2 of my wife's pork!The dessert was also great. We shared the apple tart a la dragees. It's a very thin and crispy apple pie. It was a little bit too sweet to my taste, but it didn't stop me from finishing them.Overall, I'd definitely be back to Gunther's. I heard they have a great lunch deal but even without it, a future visit to Gunther's is imminent.",

    "text": "I had friends and business associates visiting from Beijing and London. I planned to host them for dinner. \u00a0There would be at least 8 and possibly 10 of us.Three of the upmarket restaurants that I contacted insisted that a party of 8 or more must all order an agreed set dinner! \u00a0I was astounded to hear that a high dollar restaurant could not be bothered to take individual orders from my guests.One restaurant did agree to take my request for individualized service to their general manager for consideration but I told them not to bother. If a decision to give a customer and each of his guests what they wanted to eat required top manager approval then I was obviously talking to the wrong restaurant.I took a chance and hosted the dinner at Gunther's. We spent about 3 hours and about S$2,500 in Gunther's. \u00a0Not only did I consider the money well spent, I considered it a bargain.Everyone got exactly what they wanted and was extremely pleased with the quality of the food, the ambience and the attentive service.You can't go wrong with Gunther's. There are not enough upmarket restaurants in Singapore where you can get a fantastic meal served by friendly staff who are happy to meet your requests rather than insisting that you confine your expectations to the limits of their policies.Fortunately for the more demanding Singaporeans, there are still restaurants like Gunther's.All five stars were fully earned.",

The pasta was cooked to al dente and seasoned generously with truffle oil, and finally topped with Oscietra Caviar. The amazing flavor of the seasoning coupled with the bounciness of the pasta made it a satisfying dish. For dessert, the Canele from the Petit four was outstanding. It is a bite-sized snack in perfect proportions, and is crispy on the outside and chewy inside; a good finale to the meal.",
