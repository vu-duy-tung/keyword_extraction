    "text": "Possibly the best happy hour deal on the island. When you've been walking all day and then see that Tomo Izakaya has a crazy hour from 5-6:30pm with Sapporo drafts for only $3.90++ ... YAAAS! Rest my weary feet and hand me a beer (or five). They also have all you can drink packages for later in the evening if you want to do some true damage. It's truly quite perfect to grab a beer by the river as a gentle breeze hits you while the sun slowly sets. Vacation winning.",

    "text": "I came here with my mom after a bumboat trip on the Singapore river looking for a some place where we could eat late without being in a very loud club-type environment so we ended up at Tomo Izikaya as it is one of the places near the Singapore river at Clarke Quay which look cosy and less crowded.The atmosphere was certainly worth 4 stars, it is nice to sit next to the river and enjoy the view of the tourist boats passing by. However, the food is only so-so and you obviously pay for the location. The highlight of the different foods we got was the steak bites, they were tasty and nicely marinated. However, the tempura and sushi were just ok, not what you expect for this price.One more plus of this place is that the alcohol is cheap (compared to other places in Singapore), we paid 8$ for a gin tonic and 11$ for a beer which is quite good value!Would I return? Probably not, if I would, it would be for the view or the cheap drinks than the food but I guess there are so many other places at Clarke Quay which have better food options so why return?",

The inside is beautiful but we did prefer the outside bar. \u00a0Great view of the river plus they have the BEST bar manager! Great selection of sake but we took then up on their 1for1 deal. Its a dun selection of sake drinks that are AMAZING! Sake sling was sweet but well balanced with bitters and strong. The passion fruit saketini was delicious and a tart/sour Ringo saketini made my night! Great place and would highly recommend it!",

Buta kakuniStewed pork belly- Some pieces were less tender and more dry than others. - The sauce was very thick and flavorful so if you like sauce, this is definitely your dish.- Overall ok. 2. TonkatsuDeep fried pork coated with fresh bread crumbs- They were very generous in the slices of pork (thick, crispy, juicy slices). - Wished that it was more flavorful though. Perhaps marinated with something before it was fried? or maybe toss in some spicy seasoning (those power kinda that the Taiwanese street stalls always sprinkle upon their fried chicken)- Overall still good. 3. Vermicelli in a beef broth with thin beef slices and an poached egg (forgot the name of this dish. Nigi-something...) - This was sooooo GOOD :) - The beef broth was flavorful and slightly sweet :) - Mixed with the poached egg and Vermicelli noodles it was divine!!! will come back just for this dish. Ambiance is great! nice deco!",

    "text": "My husband and I usually come here on Friday nights, since it's pretty close to his office. It's also a good compromise for when I want sushi and he wants Japanese style steak, as they offer both here!Happy hour is a good time to go, as it's not too crowded and the beer prices are affordable. Miguel usually enjoys his steak, though sometimes they do overcook it and it does turn out a bit dry. They don't have the best sushi in the world, but so far I haven't gotten sick from it, so it's A-OK in my book. The tempura and their udon soup are also solid choices.The last time we were here, the service left much to be desired. First off, they delivered our dishes out of order. I ordered agedashi tofu as an appetizer and sushi for my main, and the sushi came first. Also, they forgot about our green tea, which came halfway through our meal. For some reason, Miguel's steak was taking a long time (maybe that's why it came out dry and overcooked?) and I finished my meal by the time his was delivered. At one point, they even gave us a soup that we didn't even order! It didn't help that the majority of the servers looked like little lambs lost in the woods, trying to figure out which dish belongs to which table. To top it off, Miguel asked for an extra serving of rice which was never given to us. Of course, it was added to our bill, so we had to wait even longer for them to fix the issue and give us the correct bill. Usually, the service isn't that bad, but man, were they wayyy off their game for a Friday night.Overall, I think prices are on the higher side, and probably because of the Clarke Quay location. With the numerous amount of restaurants in Clarke Quay, this is a decent choice, but not a place to go out of your way for.",

It didn't look like a very special place at first, and it was barely filled when we reached there. But subsequently, more people came in and it became quite a lively and vibrant atmosphere.I have to say I really love the whole ambience of this place, with simple decorations and warm lights. It is pretty spacious and even if you have a big group gathering, they would have done the arrangement for you in advance. The service is prompt and good too. And of course the food! The food's good. We were skeptical about the sushi at first, but it turned out that the sushi and sashimi is as good as the grilled items as well. Moreover, this restaurant operates till late on Fridays, Saturdays and public holidays. It's a comfortable and cozy place to hang out at, even in big groups.",

However if you like traditional Japanese cooking, the food is very average and a lot of the employees are not Japanese, and hence there is no authenticity or passion for Japanese food. The manager or owner, I presumed, had to be called when I ordered Stamina Natto or Shiokara, and true to form, he was very kind and respectful and accommodated me the best he could. But if you are alone for dinner, don't go here, because the service is crappy for single dudes traveling on business...Oh....and of course, because I look like I am of Indian decent (West Indian actually....), no one takes me seriously when I ask for authentic Japanese cooking....",

I was lucky enough to snag one of the ama ebi with a bit of roe! Yum. I love tiny fish eggs :) The yellowtail crudo was delicious. I wasn't impressed with the rolls. Everything had a drizzle of kewpie on it. Don't get me wrong I love japanese mayo- but not all over my sushi rolls. The small kitchen plates were good- we had the karaage and the roasted pork. The tamago was made in house but was a unpleasant gray color and fell apart. Tasty but sad to look at. \u00a0We washed everything down with plum wine that was on special- buy one bottle get one free!
