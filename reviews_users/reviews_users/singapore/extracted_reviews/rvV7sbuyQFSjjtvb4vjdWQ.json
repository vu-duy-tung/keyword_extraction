The meal brought back many memories from my past and it felt good.",

Well I don't drink coffee, so I had tea with milk and sugar instead.A really nice man asked me if I was eating there or for takeaway, and when I said it was for there, he told me to take a seat anywhere and then brought over a menu. I got the above mentioned breakfast set, which was set A. There was a set B, C, and D, which had different kinds of kaya toast. I remember set D was a kaya peanut butter toast which also sounded amazing. The kaya butter toast was pretty delicious the bread is very toasted and crispy. At one point, the nice old man sat down with me and showed me how to properly eat kaya toast. He asked to put soy sauce and some black pepper into my runny eggs. Then I mixed it and he told me to dip my toast into the runny egg/soy sauce mixture. Really tasty! Great hearty way to start the day!",

My friends and I first tried kaya toast at Nanyang Old Coffee and thought it was so good that we wanted kaya toast again. We found Ya Kun and now I'm constantly craving it.We ordered 3 different toast sets:  \u00a0 \u00a0 -KAYA TOAST WITH BUTTER \u00a0 \u00a0 -BUTTER SUGAR TOAST \u00a0 \u00a0 -KAYA PEANUT TOASTThe sets come with a stack of 4 toasts, 2 soft boiled eggs and a choice between iced coffee and milk tea. My favorite toast by miles was the KAYA PEANUT TOAST! SO GOOD. The bread here is thin and crunchy, which I preferred over Nanyang, which was thicker and softer. I think the thin bread makes for a better bread to kaya/filling ratio, and crunchy food is just better than soft food!The other two toasts were pretty good as well. Not as memorable compared to the kaya peanut, but I still enjoyed them. There was a little too much butter in the normal kaya toast though. The soft boiled eggs were cooked nicely and the iced coffee was pretty average.I'd DEFINITELY RECOMMEND coming here for breakfast. Or lunch. Or dinner. Or all three. Try the normal kaya toast but you MUST get the peanut toast as well!",

It's just outside of the Far East Square along China Street with a few other great eateries!If you're ever visiting Singapore, everyone will tell you to try the famous kaya toast at Ya Kun. I honestly think you should try kaya toast when you're in Singapore, but not at Ya Kun (I like Toast Box better). I don't understand the hype of this place. I'm not a fan of over-toasted, hard bread. With very little kaya jam and way too much butter, I had to go to another kaya toast shop later that day just to make up for the disappointing experience. I just wanted to try one slice of their toast with the kaya jam. But they suckered me in to their pricey combo special: 2 toasts, soft boiled egg, and a drink. Overall, I was super disappointed with my first kaya toast experience here.Service: 4 starsKaya Toast: 1 starOpening HoursMonday to Friday: 7.30am to 6.30pmSaturday and Sunday: 8.30am to 5.00pmPublic Holiday: Closed",

My food came out piecemeal - coffee, then 10 minutes later eggs, and another 15 later the toast but luckily I had the whole morning to hang around so enjoyed people watching in the interim. \u00a0This was clearly a super popular spot, and you can see why. If you like a breakfast on the sweeter side, you'll likely enjoy this runny egg/jam and french toast like concoction with sweet Singapore coffee. Be prepared for the sugar rush that follows and don't forget to bring your own wet wipes/napkins (probably an obvious for most of you used to Singapore but I was constantly walking around with sticky hands!)",

Kaya (toast) came up multiple times.I was like...\"yeah, that sounds so good!\" In reality, I was thinking...\"what the eff is kaya?!\"For those of you who don't know, kaya is a spread made with coconut, eggs, sugar and pandan...or so Wikipedia says.So I walked into Ya Kun Kaya Toast and of course ordered the kaya toast with butter, and decided on an iced milk tea to go with it. I guess this is a very traditional breakfast for Singaporeans, so I had to try it since breakfast is my absolute favorite meal of the day. I could seriously eat it for every meal. I loved the flavor of the kaya and it meshed really well with the toasted, warm bread. The butter was something I had a hard time with. I felt like when I got to the middle of the toast, I was just eating an entire tablespoon of butter along with the toast/kaya. I could seriously feel my arteries clogging by the second. However, when I asked a Singaporean if it was supposed to be like that, she said yes, and the butter is the best part! Perhaps I'm not cultured enough to understand all that butter, and next time, I'm just going to get kaya toast, no butter! I mean, the butter was good, I just couldn't stand eating it, knowing that it was just a chunk of butter. On the other hand, the milk tea here had good flavor, although it was a little too sweet for my liking. However, it was a great drink to drink with my food! Overall, my first experience with kaya was really good, and I even went to the store later on to purchase a jar of it to bring home. I'm just going to cut down on the butter when I do make my own!",

Plus point that they are open at 7: 30 am, to have your early breakfast in solitude. Their menu is simple - it's all about toast+ coffee/tea + soft boiled eggs, but those three things have served me well!I got the savory chasu toast and the durian kaya toast. The chasu toast was quite flavorful, but the DURIAN kaya toast won a sweet spot in my heart!! \u00a0Perfectly toasted crisp bread sandwiching the rich and creamy durian paste added with kaya and butter - delicious and they smell so good *sniff sniff* :P Service was not exactly friendly, but at least they are speedy and efficient. Overall, Ya Kun Kaya Toast is an awesome spot to get your quick breakfast fix. I'll most definitely be back!",

I love how it's dipped into the soft boiled egg, the whole combination is quite unique. Don't forget to add the sweet soy sauce into the egg! This is a popular shop with numerous franchises all over town, I find this location's decor to stand out more than ones you find at the malls! So come to this shop! It's also in a nice area with other restaurants because this is obviously just an appetizer.",

The usual kaya toast with butter, and soft-boiled eggs and iced Milo is the winning combo.My boyfriend and I walked into this place on one morning and got told that the hot drinks maker was down, but Singapore is always warm anyway, so why get the hot drinks? We were however puzzled on how on earth the soft-boiled eggs would be consumed, but the instinct took over and we soon munched the toast-dipped-in egg like a local would.Service is neither friendly nor rude, just the usual efficiency you see in Singapore and I was at least being grateful to be greeted in English, and not Chinese as everyone in Chinatown assumed that I could speak Mandarin (in which I couldn't). I would still go to this place again if I'm nearby, but for now - a jar of kaya jam bought from Singapore should do the trick when I'm at home in Copenhagen. It won't be the same, but at least I didn't have to endure the 12-hour flight.",

Their Ya Kun Kaya Toast... omg.. i just have to say.. I have never had anything like this before. Super delicious where it wasnt super sweet and just the right amount of jam to make me want to finosh my toast even if i was full from dinner. PLEAsEEEE open in the US!!! I saw they had multiple locations around Asia but non in the US!!! Im going to be sad once my jar runs out of jam! Soooo delicious. Once you try it youre gonna wanna bring a ton back home!!!",

The coffee was good, but it didn't taste that out of the ordinary. I have a really weak stomach when it comes to runny eggs and these eggs were SUPERRRRR runny.. so I didn't eat them and can't comment on how good it is.But the kaya toast... omg SO GOOD. I will admit that I felt a little sick afterwards because of how buttery and sweet it was but it was so worth it! The jam that they put in it was heaven!!

Now about the actual foodKaya Toast - kaya jam is made from eggs, coconut, and pandan. While eating the kaya toast, the flavor is primarily sweet with a hint of coconut richness and a whiff of floral pandan, but sweetness is really the primary impression here. Also, due to the generous spread of butter/margarine, kaya toast feels a lot heavier than you might expect. I thought that the soft and runny soft boiled eggs would be too much for me but I think the quality of the eggs are better here or they're just perfectly cooked. They didn't have any of that raw eggy aroma that can sometimes make me retch a bit.Milk Tea - not quite as rich as hong kong milk tea. I think the UHT milk gives it a bit more of a cooked milk flavor which is quite nice. It's not too sweet, has some decent depth of tea flavor.",

There is outside seating as well as fans-equipped inside tables. We the set of kaya toast and sugar kaya toast with iced coffee/tea and soft-boiled eggs. HOLY SMOKES. We've never had kaya toast or traditional Singaporean brekkie before and our minds were blown. I still salivate a little thinking about that delicious savory runny and sweet crunchy combo. Pandan is what makes up a lot of the kaya spread...and by golly it's amazing. The servers here all speak flawless English and Mandarin--as well as other languages! Bosses. The service was amazingly quick and efficient, and their menus are easy to navigate--so fret not, foreigners. Shoutout to the amazing staff.
