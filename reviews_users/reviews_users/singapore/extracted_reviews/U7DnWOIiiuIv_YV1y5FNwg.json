    "text": "When in Singapore, you must partake in one of the island's most famous dishes: chilli crab. Tangy, a tad sweet, savory, and spicy, it hits all of your important taste buds and leaves you wanting more. It's messy, so get in there with your fingers and dig in, literally. Order some fried buns (mantou) to soak up some of that delicious chilli sauce, and you've got a fantastic meal. It gets pricey, but it's worth it. A few tips for those non-natives ( that I learned the hard way): there are no napkins. How you're expected to eat this crab with no provided napkins is beyond me, but that's how it's done in SG. Stop by a convenience store and pick up a multi-pack of tissues, since that's what everyone uses for napkins. The restaurant provides you with a finger bowl to rinse your hands while eating. If all else fails, watch the people around you and enjoy!",

Jumbo is one of the more famous chains which serve this Singaporean dish (the other is Longbeach).The chilli crab is a little sweet, a little spicy, and while the crab itself is good, it's the sauce that really stands out. Order a few of the fried mantou (buns) on the side, and get ready to soak up all that saucy goodness! (Trust me, you'll need more mantou than you think!) \u00a0For what you pay (about $55 a kg) it's pricey. \u00a0A crab will be anywhere between $50-80, and it's not a whole lot of food, but hey, when in Singapore...The cereal prawn ($20 or so) is also really good, make sure you order it with the shell off. Breaded in a slightly sweet and crunchy cereal breading, it's well worth a try.And don't be afraid of wearing the bib for the crab (ask for it if they don't offer), even the locals do it!",

The service is not very attentive and you have to call a waiter if you need something since they don't check up on you but that's understandable since the restaurant is so packed. Make sure to make a reservation or you might have to wait a while!! Sitting outside when the sun is setting is great. The heat is combatted by the wind so you won't melt. If you want good lighting though, sit inside because the lighting after dark comes mostly from the large red sign that makes everything tinted red.",

    "text": "Delicious food, great service, and a beautiful view of the ocean. What more could you want?The black pepper crab is pretty much a standard order here. I haven't tried it anywhere else, so I can't say if it's the best one out there, but it's certainly delicious! Their other seafood items are excellent as well, and they can be prepared in pretty much any style you like. I'm personally a big fan of the garlic prawns, the steamed cod, and the yam scallops (these are especially fun, and very unique!). I would suggesting skipping the meat and rice dishes, since their specialty is seafood, and it can get a bit pricey ($30-$50 per person). Be sure to make a reservation before you go, since it's usually pretty crowded. It's a great place to go with a group (they have lots of big round tables to accommodate), and that can probably bring the cost per person down. If you plan on going here more than once, I also suggest signing up for their rewards program. You'll get a 10% discount on weekends, 20% on weekdays, and a free birthday cake from Bakerzin any day in the month of your birthday (make sure you call 4 days in advance though). The card costs $20, but you get that money back as credit, and you'll definitely end up saving more than that. So go there once, see if you like it, and if you think you'll be back there ever again, sign up for the card!",

There are six in the area but my favorite is the East Coast Seafood Centre location, mostly because its an excuse to get away from downtown, but all of them or good. You'll find the restaurant to be chaotic, crowded, and filled with locals and tourists alike. The food is served family style and is often messy, but very good. There is lots to choose from and while the staff speaks limited English it isn't hard to order. I recommend reservations as it can get very crowed. You're hotel concierge can help you out there. Seafood Centre is a 15-20 minutes cab ride from downtown. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu but the The Black Pepper or Chili Crab are must try items.",

I heard Singapore is known for their spicy crabs so of course we had to go somewhere really authentic to get it. This restaurant has a really nice bay view but it was raining that day so we couldn't sit outside to enjoy the scene. So the food. There was 13 of us and we ordered what seemed like everything on the menu so that we can try a little of everything. We got the spicy crab and the peppered crab which I guess for a non-seafood eater was pretty decent although I still wouldn't go out of my way to eat crab. My family really enjoyed it since they are seafood lovers. I do have to agree that it's probably the most flavorful crab I've ever tasted. To be honest, what I loved most about the meal was the little buns that came with the crabs. It really was just white dough with a little sugar but it was so soft and chewy and I think I probably had ten pieces all by myself. It was an overall good meal but because I don't really like seafood, I probably don't have the best judgment. One little boo boo was that they messed up our dessert and gave us a 13 people portion instead of a single serving like we asked and ended up just not giving us anything in the end after we waited for it foreverrrr. The service wasn't great but I guess we were a pretty loud annoying group with two babies that anyone would find hard to deal with.",

    "text": "We visited Jumbo Seafood with a group of friends to finally try the famous chili crab. We also got black pepper crab, clams, and some veggies as well. The food was tasty and the bib provided was absolutely necessary! I was a mess! I actually liked the pepper crab more than the chili crab because it was too sweet for my tastes. The fresh coconut was the perfect choice to combat some of the spice!The setting of the restaurant next to the beach allowed for a nice breeze. The place is great for groups with large tables that featured turn tables that are ideal for family-style meals.It was approximately $80 per person, which was reasonable for the amount of crab we ordered. For the price, I expect a bit more upscale ambiance and more attentive service. My official rating would be 3.5 out of 5 stars. If we've got a large group of guests looking to enjoy the ocean and a Singaporean traditional meal, I'll likely take them here.",

    "text": "Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in the world (and I do mean the entire world). \u00a0When I lived in Singapore we came to the East Coast Jumbo regularly and always brought out of town guests. The one on the East Cost is the best (IMHO). There is nothing fancy about this restaurant. \u00a0Come to sit by the ocean on uncomfortable plastic chairs, enjoy some cold beer, and devour as many crabs as you can. \u00a0The awesome Jumbo experience is very simple and consists of only five elements, so anyone can execute this plan. \u00a0Here it is:1) Sit outside, not inside2) Order beer, and then keep ordering it throughout the meal (you'll see why shortly)3) Order lots of Chili Crabs4) Order a ton of Man-tou buns (fried, not steamed).5) After you are done with the first 4 things, order Sago for dessert (even if the waitstaff gives you a hard time about it).I believe Chili Crab may be one of nature's most perfect food substances. \u00a0The crab is huge, meaty, and sweet. \u00a0The sauce is beyond compare - rich, tangy, and oh so spicy. \u00a0And extra good when you sop it up with the Man-tou (kind of like little savory doughnuts). \u00a0Lot's of fried spicy goodness there. \u00a0Order double the number of buns they suggest - I seem to prefer a higher bun to sauce ratio then is standard.I see many reviewers indicate you should go with Black Pepper Crab. \u00a0While that is a fine dish, I've always preferred the sauciness of Chili Crab. \u00a0But try them both - you can't go wrong. \u00a0Also, remember to wear clothes that can get soiled. \u00a0Those crabs are messy, but that is half the fun.Finally, let me put in a word for Sago. \u00a0It's kind of like cold sweetened coconut soup with melon balls and ice shavings. \u00a0Delicious, refreshing, and the perfect antidote to your burning lips from the yummy Chili Crab. \u00a0My Father almost passed out from delight the first time he had Sago here.In short, when I next make the long, long, long trip from Chicago to Singapore I will be heading to Jumbo.",

Not because of the food, no, no, but because of how messy you will get eating the delicious, drool inducing chili crab. This is some of the best stuff on earth. Seriously. If you come here for nothing else you will be quite happy. The crab is really fresh and the sauce is just so he right amount of spicy. It's very messy and finger lickin good. We also had the cereal prawn that was just a bit too sweet, it tastes very similar to coconut shrimp and also the yam covered scallops. They were also very good. You obviously have to have beer with your chili crab so make sure to grab a pitcher of tiger. This is the third or fourth time here from America, I will always come back here to eat. I love it so much. I'll be coming here for years to come. I wish they sold the chili sauce by the gallon. I would just drink it.",

If you're in the CBD I wouldn't travel all the way out here unless you wanted to check out the east coast park and beaches.First off, this place is outdoors and hot AF...and it's very close to the strait of Singapore, so it does have a nice ocean breeze.It's definitely pricey, like $50-60 per crab, but any crab that's damn near a kilo will be. Much different than the USA blue crabs or king/snow crab legs...they give you a bib for a reason.While I did enjoy the Chilli Crab, the Black Pepper Crab is even better. Apparently the ish is to get deep fried mantou (those white chinese bread things), which you can then dip in the sauce. A little too rich for me, I prefer rice! They ran out of razor clams :'( We also ordered cereal prawns and deep fried crispy squid; cereal prawns are unique, I wasn't a huge fan of the squid, it didn't taste bad or anything, just not my ish.4 stars only because it's very much like a factory and I felt like the waitrons were trying to constantly upsell with more food than needed, special order desserts (apparently they take a while), and threatening that if you don't order now it'll take an hour (???). That being said, there are a ton of diners, so it's somewhat plausible, I'm just not that used to it.",

The ocean breeze that night was quite cool and a pleasant change to the heat of the day. We were seated right away, and requested to be seated outside so we could enjoy the weather (better than being in 20 degrees and snow in NJ). The food was great and just as I had remembered it from two nights before. This time, we went with the Black Pepper Crab and Chili Crab (again), but also tried the Salted Egg Prawns and the Tofu dish. Again, everything did not have a chance once it hit the table. Each nook and cranny of the crabs was cleaned up, combined with the fried buns and chili sauce. As it was my last night in Singapore, I thought it would be good to buy the mix to take back to the States to have a crack at making it myself one day.Startlingly impressive food; makes you eat beyond capacity.",

    "text": "The usual Singaporean-go-to spot for seafood. The east coast branch is by far the most popular on the island. I am guessing it's because of its complimentary location near the sea adds to one's seafood dining experience. It's super crowded on weekend evenings. Do not attempt to go without a booking, especially if it is a public holiday weekend. Overall, Jumbo doesn't disappoint. It serves quality seafood amidst a casual and family-friendly environment. Singaporean families (across generations - think aunty, uncle, cousins...) gather here for good seafood. Food: 1. Pepper crab - Awesome! Get your bibs ready! It can get messy. 2. Chili crab sauce & man tou - I LOVE their man tous (fried buns). It's fried to golden perfection! Crispy on the outside but soft & smooth on the inside. I could eat a plate of these (they are pretty small in size), especially dipped in chili sauce. TIP: you can order the chili crab sauce without having to order the whole crab itself. So you can have your crab in another sauce (black pepper) and still get to enjoy the wholesome goodness of dipping your man tous in the chili sauce. Double happiness. 3. Fried you tiao - LOVE! These are fried doughs stuffed with fish paste. It may sound strange to foreigners but they are heavenly. A must-try for sure. 4. Mee goreng - Good. A little spicy though. Be warned. 5. Mix vegetable & mushrooms - Good. The mushrooms were so fresh. 6. Steam prawns with egg - LOVE! The prawn was so fresh & sweet. It comes served with a sweet black sauce which goes so well with the prawns. I could eat this all day. Service: - Very efficient!",

You canalso requestfor them to giveyou bibswhich ishighly recommended as the seafood had a tendency to go flying around. \u00a0To top it off, \u00a0there are also outdoor seating available for you to enjoy the oceanfront via while eating during the day or harbor lights at night.

    "text": "Went to Jumbo on my first trip to Singapore, and I am already trying to plan another vacation back out here just to get the Chili Crab! Came here with a large party for dinner and sat outside. It was really nice to sit along the water and the weather was just right- no jacket needed and it was cool nice breeze (good break from all the humidity!)Ordered and sampled a variety of things and was not disappointed in any thing!By far the chili crab was my favorite! Saw you could buy a mix to take home and make yourself but I didn't in fear it would not turn out the same. In California we have different types of crab so was almost positive it would not turn out the same :( It's also really good if you dip your bread into the chili sauce! The tangy, sweet, spicy and savory sauce it comes with is to diiiiiie for! Devastated theres nothing like this in the US!Pepper crab- delicious! Perfect blend of a spicy and sweetness of a crabBoiled live shrimp comes in a wine soup - get about 3 per person.Chicken/Beef kabobs- tastes good if you dip it in their peanut sauce!Malaysia dry noodle- reminded me to be similar to a spaghetti with seafood in it. Mango- not sure if its the right season or if its just always good- but the mango is soft and sweet! perfect way to end your meal.Ate a lot more- but can't remember the names. If I can remember the names I will update this review accordingly!Staff is great and attentive- always there to switch out your messy plates and bring more stuff to the table as needed. Free wifi for restaurant guests- on the table you will see the wifi name and password.",

Place is clean with wipes and bowls to clean ones hands.A lady came to pour us some tea which we found out was not complementary after talking to her for 5 minutes, so we gallantly denied the tea.The main waiter came and took our order. We weren't sure how big the portions were so we asked for how much people the medium portion is meant. 4-6 he said, but we wanted to share by 2 so we took the 2-3. First our friend got his fried fish which came pretty late so we shared that. His side order would not arrive for the next 30 minutes.Our dish came and is meant for one person with a small stomach. Trying to find the waiter without success we got pretty angry but decided not to do anything about it. When the side dish came after 2 times asking again, we shared that as well. Maybe we should have ordered the 160Sin$ Lobster...maybe than we would have been treated like real customers.",

Our taxi driver laughed when we told him we hated it and he told us we should have eaten at the Eastcoast Hawker Centre as it's better, more authentic and cheaper - I wish we'd known that before we spent a fortune here ;-)Definitely not a recommend!",

After a fair amount of internet research, I decided to go with Jumbo which would provide a \"nicer\" restaurant experience and would have great chili crab - we were not disappointed. I made a reservation through Chope which is highly advisable, particularly on a weekend night. I didn't see many people queuing, but all of the tables were full. We had an early reservation and were able to secure an outdoor table where we could enjoy the sunset and view (but beware of mosquitos!). We ordered a chili crab (a \"medium\" sized one which was plenty for the three of us), a side of vegetables, steamed rice and chow mein. The chili crab was delicious and has the right balance of heat and sweetness. Definitely order steamed rice to drench your rice in the crab and sauce. The chow mein was underwhelming.",

The black pepper crab is not as good though so perhaps stick to the chili crab for Jumbo. The seafood is fresh in general - we also enjoyed the ginger and scallion prawn and steamed fish.",

Service was great as our server even helped us to crack the crab more.Onto the food, we got the more expensive Alaskan deep sea crab cuz there was a \"promotion\". The dish came like warm. This was not my first time eating chili crab in jumbo or no signboard and luke warm crab was not satisfying. The chili sauce was amazing as it seems like they put broken crab meat in it. Overall, I think jumbo or no signboard have both going downhill in terms of quality. Maybe next time chili crab should no longer be my must eat.",

Dishes came out one by one and the table would be empty for a good 5-10 minute between dishes. This is not typically for a family style, Asian restaurant. The staff and kitchen usually time the dishes better so there's a continuous flow of food. Most of the food was cold when arrived, but very flavorful. The main dish was the black pepper crab and it was quite delicious. Very nice pepper taste that left your mouth tingling a bit with spice; would have tasted better if the dish was warmer. Overall, food is not bad. The reason for the 2 is due to the slow service and cold food. I hope this restaurant can staff up and be more efficient with the dining experience.",

    "text": "On our last night in Singapore, my boyfriend's mother and sister took us to Jumbo Seafood where we had a beautiful waterfront view. Although I love crab, my boyfriend isn't a fan but we still decided to go because our new friends in Hong Kong raved about trying pepper and/or chili crab. We ordered:- Chili crab- Fried cod fish with spicy sauce- Scallops wrapped in yam ring- Broccoli with scallops- Steamed (white) buns and deep fried bunsThe chili crab was wonderful! The crab we received, a portion size for three people, was the largest crab I've ever seen!! Certainly fitting considering the name of the restaurant. I'm not usually a fan of filling up on bread, but it was difficult to resist dipping the steamed buns in the chili crab sauce. And.. this is was after I ate spoonfuls on top of my rice. So much flavor!The broccoli with scallops were fine, but the scallops wrapped in yam were even better! My boyfriend almost decided to get a second order of them. Finally, the fried cod fish was delicious! I would order that again as well. Our bill ended up around SGD 200-250.. If you're not opposed to taking a day trip to Malaysia (possible via bus, car or taxi), we were told you can get much more pepper or chili crab for much cheaper there! Regardless, I highly recommend you check this place out if you're in Singapore! Extra tips and FYIs:- There is no AC!- Make reservations if you want to avoid a long wait during certain days or times.- The menu has plenty of pictures and English to help guide your ordering.- Chili crab can be quite messy; I recommend using the disposable bibs they give out.- Don't be afraid to flag down any server you see if you need something!- If you have trouble breaking through the HUGE claws or other parts of the crab, you can put them on a plate and ask the server to have the kitchen break them for you! You don't want any going to waste :)",

So good :) I was quite surprised at the chili crab because I wasn't sure what to expect other than I hear Singaporeans chili crab is really good. And that it was, I found it to be the perfect balance of taste and spicy. It was quite good and the black pepper was a good flavor too. Definitely was a messier meal and expect to get your hands finger licking dirty with yummy sauce. The crab was fresh and good quality. The fresh prawns were also quite good and plump! And we had an 2 appetizers, one was scallops and taro while the second was a tofu dish. And a salted fish chicken fried rice.Service was not the best but fine, just had to wave them down for a little. Location is great because here is indoor covered outdoor seating and it's on the oceanfront so you can have a nice view as well as walk along the water before or after your meal. Would definitely return and bring guests that visit too Tip: reservations so you don't have to queue. But even if you do, it's not too bad if you go early Tip 2: bring some napkins and don't wear white in case you get it dirty when you use your hands for the crab",

    "text": "Came here on a Monday night due to a recommendation from a local friend and this place was packed! We didn't have a reservation but luckily were seated within 10 minutes. We ordered both the famous chili crabs as well as the black pepper crabs. They'll provide you with bibs which were an absolute must because the sauce can easily get everywhere.The sauce from the chili crab was perfectly seasoned! Rich and thick yet not too spicy. Tons of flavor imbued in every bite. I simply couldn't stop eating it. Then the black pepper crabs arrived and I started devouring those too, although I did find the kick of the pepper to be actually a tad bit stronger than the chili version.If you make it out here, you won't go wrong with either dish. But just to be safe, you should definitely order both!",

    "text": "When in Singapore, you must try chilli crab - or atleast that's what any guide book seems to insist. Suppressing all scepticism, I took a visiting friend to Jumbo which is one of the four chilli crab Meccas here all lined conveniently next to each other along East Coast park. We got one chilli crab to share between two of us which cost around $62. No chilli crab is complete without deep fried buns to mop up the gravy and Jumbo's are just sheer perfection: crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside with just a slight sweetness to them. At this point, I need to throw up my hands and admit that YES Jumbo's serves some pretty damn good chilli crab. The gravy is delicious. Rich and thick, the best part is the sharp kick to it at the end. I was expecting it to be a lot spicier than it was but it had too much flavour packed into it to make up for it. The crab itself was juicy and tender. We struggled to get all the flesh out of the shell but it's worth prying out every little bit. The atmosphere is also incredibly relaxing especially if you snag an outside table right next to the ocean. The staff were all very prompt and efficient. We were the last ones to leave the restaurant but they made no motion to hurry us and even gave us a 10% discount at the end for no reason! My only gripe is the very small vegetarian selection which is somewhat understandable at a seafood restaurant. My mother got rice with vegetable stir fry which came in a tiny portion costing $18. Total rip off for a very average tasting dish.",

It's very expensive, and they give you some weird stuff (for non-singaporeans) that are not very tasty. I would just order off the menu only.",
