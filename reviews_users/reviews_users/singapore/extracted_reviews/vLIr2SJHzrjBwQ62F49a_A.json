The soup was so flavorful but still maintained a light flavor. The noodles were very good as well but I do think the reviews are right that the chili makes the dish. This is also very cheap as everything is under $10. The only issue is that this is so far that you spend $20 on taxi fare which is double the price of the meal. I also got takeaway but it wasn't as good...still good but the soup tastes different.",

    "text": "Rare night without the kids and decided to try some spicy noodles. Getting here - they have limited street parking but it's easier to just park at the HDB parking lots nearby and walk over, not far. They have pictures of what they serve so it's easy to figure out what you would like. As greedy people, hubby and I had our noodle bowl and an extra bowl of soup with their jumbo fishballs to share. I love the idea of a nicely poached egg in my noodles, waiting for me to break it over my noodles. As its called Chilli noodles, then must do it justice and lace my noodles with the good stuff. As other reviewers had cautioned, their Chilli packs a punch and go easy if you're unsure. They leave jars of Chilli on your table so you can raise the spice level any time you want. From the first mouthful, I am hooked! Hook, line and sinker! Done! It's AMAZING. I actually lack the vocab to tell you why I love it. I only know I need to tabao some more back so I can eat it again the next day (which I did, while it wasn't as good as fresh, it was still pretty darn awesome). I am definitely a fan. I need to pay the noodle stall homage often from now on!",

    "text": "I love the signature noodles! I have gone there twice within 2 weeks. The queue on Saturday is quite manageable and it helps to have a sign outside indicating customers are to share tables during peak periods. That also means the staff is on hand to make sure customers wait outside (with order chit and menu) and will assign tables to those in line as and when seats are available. The process is quite fast, and food is served within 5-10 minutes after ordering. They must have streamlined the nightmarish long waits during the first few months after opening.I think the sweet spot for less people will be after the usual lunch time and before the dinner rush. Be warned people may start to stream in after 4pm for early dinner though. It probably makes sense since they close at 8pm and last order is at 730pm or so. The noodles is different from the usual noodles in Singapore. It is al dente and chewy, giving more bite to the noodles. I like that you can adjust the level of spiciness in your noodles since you get to add the amount of chili. It can get really spicy so do it slowly. I added 4-5 spoonfuls of the chili the first time and that almost burnt my tongue. The chili looked harmless but it packed a punch. The 2nd visit, I just added 2 spoonfuls and it was just nice.The noodles is just so good with the crispy ikan bilis, minced meat, meat balls and perfectly soft boiled egg. Order a bowl of handmade fish ball soup for the huge fish ball which has real fish taste (and meat probably) unlike those machine factory made fish ball which tastes more of starch filler than fish meat. I am not a fish ball fan or connoisseur but this is really good. Sweet, soft, bouncy and salty. The bean sheet with fish ball and meat ball soup can be skipped unless you really want the bean sheet. The bean sheet is so-so. This is a place I can go dine at all the time. There is street parking but it may be better to park at the URA car park further away and just walk over. Otherwise there are a bus stop and MRT (Tai Seng) nearby.",

    "text": "First thing came to my mind when I ate this was: comfort food. That kind of taste you'll miss when you are far from home. It's simple yet delicious.I ordered their signature noodles. No fancy ingredients. Just minced pork, ikan bilis, poached egg, fried onions and meatballs in the noodle bowl. These complement each other. Since their shop name is Kin Kin CHILLI Pan Mee, no one should ever leave this place without ever trying their chilli. Spicy and stir fried(my guess) \u00a0till fragrant. Goes very well with the noodles with a kick of spiciness. My friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon and had to share table. The place was filled. Other than us, there were only a couple of people waiting. Food came quite fast too. Our food came around 5 minutes later after we ordered. This place is definitely for those truly like their noodles instead of chilling out.",

They are delicious and yes I know I should be sentenced to jail for not liking chilli but the noodles still taste awesome even without chilli. I know I know I'm missing out on life. But it's still super good without chilli! Although, now I'm inclined to know what the real one in KL tastes like! There was so much fried onions and ikan bills, minced meat which added so much flavour to the noodles! 3 meatballs and the egg to add some oooomph! To the dish :) gotta come back here for more awesomeness!",

    "text": "AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL! I would give this place 5 stars if not for the crazy wait.Kin Kin Chili Pan Mee is the first stop on my itinerary whenever I visit KL- the last time was in November 2013 and I'd been having a craving as of late so this opening couldn't have been more timely. And judging from the number of articles/facebook shares this got when it first opened, it seems that quite a few of my friends share my fervent cravings for this place too.Came here on a weekday afternoon and there was a pretty long queue outside, though not as bad as expected. Perhaps about 20 meters? You're queuing at the corridor along a row of shophouses, it's sheltered and not too bad.The restaurant itself is air-conditioned and way cleaner than the original stall in Malaysia. BUT service is a lot slower. We were given a standard menu with about 10 items to choose from (most people just pick their Signature noodles) and an ordering chit which we had to fill in and then bring to the counter and pay. For some reason just the queue to submit the chit and pay took quite long (about 25mins) - according to my dining companion, it was because everyone in the queue was trying to add this and that to their meals and coming up with all sorts of funky special orders. Gosh.So after paying, we expected our noodles to come pretty quickly. My friend joked that it would be a one-hour wait. Shortly after we said that, the couple next to us (we were all made to share tables) asked the waiter about their order and I overheard that they had arrived about an hour before we did and my face turned pale as I realised that MY FRIEND WAS NOT JOKING. Or rather, he was joking but it turned out to be true. T_TAnyway we didn't wait for 1 hour for our noodles. We waited ONE AND A HALF HOURS. Which made it about 3pm by the time we actually got our food... which was really really good and as good as the original and a must-try but you know what, the thought of waiting 2 hours for it again just makes me balk. Honestly I have no idea why it took so long, considering how standard the order was. But then again we saw a bunch of people doing takeaways of 10, 20 bowls so that could have been the reason.Will return, but not so soon... perhaps when the hype finally dies down.It was quite difficult to find legit parking around the area and we resorted to slightly illegal means (luckily we didn't get a ticket!). Seems quite troublesome to get to without a car too.",

    "text": "Recently opening their Singapore branch with much hype 2 months ago (to the extent of having to queue up to 2-3 hours just for the food on their first few days), Restoran Kin Kin is a popular restaurant in KL specializing in their chilli pan mee.Besides having the original pan mee and other types of you mian, they also have soups.The Signature Dry Chilli Pan Mee ($5) looks like an ordinary dry ban mian when it was served out, but after mixing the chilli paste that is provided on the table, it's not hard to see why this is one of the favourites here. The chilli, while not being overly spicy, brought out the flavour in the ban mian after mixing the minced meat, ikan bilis, poached egg, fried onions and meatballs. It tasted like a dry ramen you can get in a Japanese restaurant, except that this is more flavourful, more filling, less dry and definitely more spicier (but less spicier than other types of noodles).The chilli that is responsible for the great tasting pan mee.As the hype for this place becomes more manageable, it is now easier to have a meal here (be it for lunch or for dinner, dine-in or takeaway). Given that this place is around the MacPherson / Tai Seng area, this place will be filled with the lunch crowd!",
