Found this place upstairs and towards the middle of the unusually shaped hawker centre. They serve char kway teow and that is all. $3 for the standard serving, $1 extra for more cockles, 50c for more egg. The cook had just finished the last batch when I arrived, so I got to watch him work, and he is a master at it.He deserves 9.5/10 for the food, but I had to round down for the lack of sliced pork. Otherwise, everything was fantastic and delicious. If you are in the area, stand in line, watch the master work, then savor his art.",

On this trip back to Singapore I made it a quest to find a good char kway teow and this plate was pretty awesome. It has lots of hums (cockles) and bits of crispy pork lard. It is not too wet or dry. Unfortunately it does not have much of a wok hei flavor. Plus there is no lup cheong (Chinese sausage). But this is definitely a wow if you are a cockle lover. The queue is not very long at 1030am on weekdays, maybe about 10-15 mins wait.",

I'm pretty positive this is something new added as I think I would have remembered tasting it before.

Filled with delicious crunchy pork lard and rice noodles, it's not exactly a healthy start to the day, but damn it's good. I came early in the day and it wasn't too busy, so the kway teow mee was served fast and fresh for just $3. I shared it with my partner and with the heat that had already kicked in, was enough to keep us going until lunch (though I could have easily smashed one to myself without hesitation!).The cockles are very fishy, so if that isn't your thing I would recommend ordering without it. We opted for extra chilli and it was well spiced. Definitely a dish I will be missing at home and having been to Penang the day after this visit, can say it's right up there as one of the better noodle dishes I had on this trip.",
