    "text": "I am a convert to yakitori after dining here. I never really like yakitori as those I had tried before were pretty ho-hum. Grilled meat on skewers. Nothing special or mind blowing. I have walked past Nanbantei countless times but somehow have never dined there. It just never appealed to me as the menu looks limited and the specialty is yakitori which is not my favorite type of Japanese food. Then a friend dined there and said it was good, and the lunch menu has decent pricing. So it stayed at the back of my mind for the \"one day\" moment. Well, that day arrived when I walked past it again and decided to just try it. The place was packed and apparently you need a reservation. I was lucky and got a spot with the caveat that I would need to vacate in an hour as someone else has a reservation then. There were only 3-4 tables with the rest of the seats surrounding the chefs table where you could see them grilling the meat. Everyone was patiently waiting for the meat to be ready and food to be served. It seemed like everyone just ordered the yakitori bento which was a good deal. Yakitori bento consists of 5 sticks (asparagus wrapped with pork, pork with shiso leaf, tsukune, leeks and pork and quail eggs), miso soup, rice with 3 toppings, pickles and dessert (red bean and mochi). All that for under $20 makes it a value for money meal. The meat was so perfectly grilled that they were tender and juicy. They did not need to rely on the sweet sauce or heavy seasoning to mask any smell or taste. It was just the best yakitori ever for me.",

No efforts were spared despite being a set lunch, moreover the portions were not skimpy. Taste was excellent as far as Japanese food goes. Expect nothing extraordinary but just good food done right. Reservations can be taken online which make it a breeze!",

Our dinner for 2 with 2 beers was $101++, but could easily be enjoyed for less. I would return.",

But the course sets are a good value and includes a nice selection of yakitori and sashimi, and the larger sets include grilled fish and a nabe as well. \u00a0The yakitori + sashimi set is a good way to go for one or two people. \u00a0The sashimi is a bit limited but fresh; however, the slices were inconsistent in thickness. \u00a0Among the yakitori, I enjoyed the negima and asparagus bacon, and the shiitake was also very good. \u00a0There is a small selection of shochu and sake, which is also well-priced. \u00a0Overall, while I wouldn't say that Nanbantei is great, it is a good value.",

Grilled unagi at 18$ was the single most expensive item we ordered but the others (chicken wings, asparagus and bacon, mushrooms) cost 5-8$ per order of 2 sticks.
