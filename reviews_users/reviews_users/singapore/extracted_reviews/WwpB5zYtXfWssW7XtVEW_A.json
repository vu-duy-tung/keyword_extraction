It was a warm night and we were seated immediately and given menus. My friend ordered a Coke and a glass of water and I ordered a bottle of San Pellegrino. My friend ordered a cheese and spinach dish which she said was delicious and I got the pizza margherita which came with a thin crust and was delicious (no substitutions or changes here) My only caveat is that all drinks are very expensive and imported liquors and wine by the glass or bottle even more so. a milkshake is 10 SGD. A service charge is added to the bill so there is no need to tip unless you feel your service was outstanding. Otherwise, it was a good experience and I would recommend.",

Glad I didn't buy anything more expensive. From eyeballing a couple other food orders while I was here, it looks like their pizza is ok.There is delicious food in Singapore. I would eat elsewhere.",

    "text": "Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday quite recently with the Groupon offer for $40 for $100 worth (used their $10 disc. for new customers to get it cheaper). My conclusion? Expensive.We ordered a lasagne and seafood pasta for mains, a tiramisu as well as a lava cake for $108 total.Their 'freshly handmade' lasagne was very soggy and made the whole dish bland. So much for a $28++ dish. Even Pizza Hut does better than them.My friend, however, enjoyed his Seafood pasta so good for him, he gets his money's worth bc of the generous amount of seafood portioned into his one dish.Admittedly, their desserts are better than many I've tried before me. Their Tiramisu is coffee-based, and it is one of the softest texture I had. It was really creamy and the addition of cream as well as fruits made the combination really amazing. Costed $14 but definitely not a disappointment like the lasagne was.The lava cake is a whole another story altogether. It is crispy and literally melts in your mouth. They have ice cream, as well as whipped cream and fruits which complements the rich chocolate. Definitely one of the better ones I've tried.So while the mains really have me disappointed especially since I love lasagne, the desserts are worth a try. Though I'd only comeback when they have a Groupon offer for its rather pricey.Overall, Modesto, great job. Perhaps you need you mediate your quality and know when to label as freshly made and specify a longer waiting time only to disappoint an eager stomach.",

    "text": "Because this was our first day in Singapore and we were extremely hungry, we stopped here as it was close to our hotel. When we came here, it was a bit empty for dinner on a weekday. I ordered a coke and when it came, it was really flat. I thought it was weird as they gave my friend a can for diet coke and they gave me a glass for regular coke. Therefore, I asked the waiter if they had the cans instead and she said no unless it was diet so I had to order a diet as I dislike flat soda. I ordered the seafood linguini which took a bit to come out and when you're hungry, it seemed as forever! The dish itself was good. It was a good proportion and it came with a lot of seafood. The downside to this restaurant is the price. It's pretty pricey for the food as my dish was more than $30. Although I did enjoy it, I'm not sure if I would return due to the price, the soda experience and the response time of the waiters.",

But if pizza is the most recognized food in the world, a GOOD pizza is sometimes the most difficult thing to find. For me, though, a pizza succeeds or fails on the quality of its crust and the freshness of its products. I still haven't found a place that reminds me of pizza parlours in Italy, but Modesto's is a decent spot in Singapore, conveniently located. Pizzas are wood-fire oven baked, have a crispy crust and a classic but perfect toppings combination.Why only 3 stars? It just feels kind of expensive... Guys, it's just a pizza.",

But towards the end i felt it was overly rich... so adding more pepper or chili flakes help I guess.The set also comes with a drink and gelato! I had a vanilla gelato and the texture was really smooth! Interior deco is also nice! Had a good dining experience there. Staff were helpful and fast too",

I had a Caesar salad that had slightly limp romaine and bacon bits-not real bacon that tasted more like dog treats.I also felt a little unsettled that 3 waiters stood a few feet from our table chatting up and constantly watching us.Evian water is what was on the menu. However, that is not what was brought to me when I ordered bottled water. The pizza was mediocre. Not memorable.",

    "text": "I drop by Modesto's at least once in a month because it is excellently located in the Orchard Road district and makes for a good dinner place before a movie. Been coming here since I was 17 and the standards have been rather consistent through the years.Don't expect a spiffy romantic ambience for outdoor seating - more often than not, you will usually be surrounding by tourists and blokes watching a game. If you are not too keen on that, request for indoor seating which is actually quite a stark contrast with with low lights and pressed tablecloths. I usually get the Rigatoni All' Amatriciana - tube-shaped pasta coated with fragrant home-made tomato sauce, streaky bacon and caramelised onions. Makes for a pretty satisfying meal. They usually do their pastas al dente, so if you like it softer, it's better to let them know. Most of their wood-fired pizzas are pretty decent too, my personal favourite being the Funghi one - mushrooms overload!",

Their climbing prices are also testimony to that - which restaurant would increase their prices (or even charge $17-$18) for a simple pasta dish if the demand is not great? And yes it can be pricey. Make use of their lunch specials if you can - those really give you a bang for your buck!",

    "text": "While I've never been to their other branches, I'm often at their Orchard branch (opposite the Forum). This restaurant is a good place to come with friends, or a casual date. Modesto's serves traditional Italian wood-fired pizzas that starts from about $21 for a regular-sized pizza, although smaller options are available. The regular-sized ones are just nice for one. My favourite pizza is the Ricotta e Spinaci which is basically a cheese and spinach pizza... it's got a great base and taste delicious! Their Portobello pizza is another decent option. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because it feels slightly pricey for what I'm getting. I compare it to La Villa which sells pizzas for $20++ too, with a nicer ambience, and I suppose it just feels kind of expensive. For pastas - I love their simple Spaghetti Al Pomodoro which is basically just fresh tomatos and basil but at $19++ I often hesitate to order it and pick a \"better value\" pizza / pasta instead. Altogether two mains and two non-alcoholic drinks comes up to around $70 for two.",
