    "text": "It all began when I saw the long line outside a Japanese restaurant at St. Mark's Place in NYC. As Singapore has taught me, a queue must mean something's good for the taking, so I joined it for an hour-long wait in the blistering New York winter and was rewarded with a steaming bowl of springy noodles with chashu that has been cooked so long in broth that it melts like butter in my mouth. This was Ippudo New York.A year later, I heard Ippudo was coming to Singapore, and was insanely happy. Even though it wasn't nearly the same, and the chashu here was not as mind-blowing, the rich broth of the red bowl and the same springy noodles convinced me to order kaedama (additional order of noodles to add to your remaining soup). My husband, who often has half a bowl of soup left over in his ramen bowls, polished off the whole bowl of splendid broth.6 months later, I completed my homage when I went to Roppongi Hill's Ippudo in Tokyo. This was the ultimate chashu shrine and which all Ippudos aspire to be I think.While the wait staff at Ippudo Mandarin Gallery attempt the same level of enthusiasm as their counterparts in Tokyo, I am reserving my fifth star for when their chashu attains the same melting quality. This beats Tonkotsu King I feel, but then again, perhaps my feelings towards Ippudo are heavily influenced by my experiences in all three countries.",

For some reason, a couple of weeks ago I decided to give it another go and to my pleasant surprise, Ippudo has improved. One of the reason why I disliked Ippudo was that their ramen broth was always lukewarm by the time it got to the table. But now, it's much hotter and this really matters. You can also choose the hardness of the noodle now, which is another important factor.Ippudo, you're back on my go-to list.",

    "text": "Years ago, I would never have thought of eating at Mandarin Gallery but in the past two years, more and more restaurants and cafes have been opening up and gaining popularity, using the expensive, upper-class feel of the area to complement their fine cuisine. However, I was not too fond of the ambience at Ippudo with loud music playing in the background, a stark contrast to the other quieter and more relaxing restaurants in the building. The tonkotsu ramen, though, I really liked. The soup was good enough to drink. The noodles were springy in texture while the pork belly was soft and decadent. The egg was also cooked just nice with a slight runny yolk. The normal ramen costs $16 while the egg added an additional $3, but was well worth it. The sides, on the other hand, was less outstanding. I did not really like the rather tough gyoza and though the shrimp mayo was rather good, it wasn't quite worth the $13 for 4 shrimps. Ippudo is slightly pricey with an average meal costing about $25 to $30 with drinks, but the ramen lives up to its reputation. The biggest thing putting me off though is the queue which goes round a table inside the small restaurant and out of the restaurant, and groups with 3 or more people will not be seated until everyone is present. If you go there, try the Sakura flower tea for a more unique tea experience!",

The broth does not disappoint and you can even choose the tanginess of your noodles and strength of your broth. Their sides and desserts are pretty good too.The only drawback is that this place seems to draw long lines.

    "text": "Ippudo came to Singapore with much fanfare, but I'm sad to say that it doesn't really live up to the hype. I'm not saying it isn't good, it's definitely one of my top few choices if I were to have ramen, but it's not in my top 2. Having been to an Ippudo outlet in Japan before in Yokohama, I'd say the only similarities between them are the long snaking queues. When it comes to the ramen, the portions and condiments found in Ippudo here pale in comparison. Taste wise, I can honestly say it is very close, say 85% to what I had in Japan. The service staff here are decent but compared to the ones at Santouka, pale in comparison. However, for people who may not find Santouka to their liking, or for those who are new to ramen, Ippudo would be a very good choice to begin the foray into the world of ramen. Just don't bring them to Ajisen to skew their views of what ramen should be!",

    "text": "My second time at Ippudo and yes the ramen is REALLY good, however after this visit I did leave wondering if it was THAT good considering the 40 minute queue and the $70 bill for two... That's a lot of dosh for some noodles! Granted, we also ordered some very over priced limonata and a gyoza to share, but still... I found myself questioning whether the quality/price ratio was in order. I had the poor belly ramen with the seasoned egg, and yes, the meat is tender and the egg was perfectly soft boiled, but I did find the noodles rather salty. You choose the texture of your noodle and I can't say I found much of a difference between my boyfriend's firm and my soft! You can pay a few dollars to have your noodles replenished if you have enough soup left in the bowl. This is always tempting when placing your initial order but we manage to reign it in by the time we have slurped up our bowls. The service is Japanese friendly, with the welcoming \"moshy moshy\" being yelled out left right and centre. Service is also efficient - good when you're waiting (and willing that waiting line to go faster), but leaves you feeling a little short changed when you've eaten your $35 meal in about 15 minutes! Jury is out, I might go back for a third time, but I probably should try out one of the many other ramen options out there first!",

My usual order is usually the Shiromaru Tamago (Ippudo Original Tonkotsu with flavored egg). Also, I like the interior of the shop. It's simple and cozy, which is really a great place to have a good meal and catch up with some old friends. The staffs are usually quite attentive as well, overall attributing a positive dining experience. On the downside, I really hate the queue sometimes. The queue can get really long at the weekends and during dinner hours. So to avoid frustration, just avoid those times. Last but not least, complete the ramen meal with a delicious and light sakura flower pot tea! This is a must-have for me whenever I visit Ippudo as well. The first time I tried it, I liked it already. It's enough to share with a friend, but for some reason or another, they do not allow refill for the pot. Enough said. Oishii!!!",

With every ramen tasting this good, you won't have to worry about your choice. Bite-size gyozas are also a good add on to have with your meal.

I had high regards for Ippudo based on my experience in NYC, but sadly, I must believe that the experience I had here in Singapore did not meet that expectation.We arrived to a queue of about 2-3 tables ahead of us. We arrived around 8PM and it seemed to be a good time to come, as tables were turning over.We managed to secure our own table (there appeared to be options for a more communal, big table experience too.I ordered the Shiromaru Special - that included an egg, bamboo shoots and cubed pork, served on a side plate. Generally the ramen was nice and firm, and the broth was rich. I would've appreciated if they had actually served the special, with the extras IN the ramem - as they tasted cold when left on the side plate.I've sought out many ramen places in my (short) lifetime thus far, and while Ippudo ranks in the upper half, it definitely isn't the best I've had. Wouldn't feel bad recommending it to someone if they enjoy ramen.",

Love the egg tamargo! - So used to having my tamargo cold and placed on top a shushi but Ippudo's take on the hot tamargo has changed my stereotype of it being a solely cold dish. Definitely like it hot better now (not many japanese restaurants serve it this way). - Their tamargo is like an omelette but slightly sweeter. However, the only downside is the 1-2 hour queue :( definitely not worth the long wait. I recommending going during odd hours like 3pm (no queue).",

However the price is on the high side and I would recommend this as one of the best ramen shop in town .Interior design is great with a woody touch, giving patrons a homely feeling, but keep in mind the close proximity between tables and the long queues might not make this an ideal place to chill out.",

We visited on a weekday lunch and it took us about 20 minutes before we finally got a table. Still within reasonable waiting period, in my opinion. We ordered the Shiromaru and Akamaru ramen, with no add-ons. The ramen itself was rather bland and forgettable, but the broth was pretty good. I just feel that for $17 per bowl, the taste could have been better. I did not find anything special about the ramen, except for the soup perhaps. The pork was normal, nothing special.

I think the broth was at a good temperature and the toppings were tasty. I'm glad you can choose the hardness of the noodle too. I think that choice goes underrated in a lot of ramen shops. The interior was really nice of course. The open design was good. A little bit loud, but still nice. We had a spot right in front of the kitchen, which is always a fun experience.I wouldn't give it the title of best ramen in Singapore, but \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"",

    "text": "My basis for trying out Ippudo is because it's the biggest ramen brand in the world. I had read about the Akamaru Shin-Aji \"Modern Tonkatsu\" ramen and came here prepared to order it. Perhaps my expectations had been too hyped up. I was expecting an out-of-this-world broth that would blow my mind and scream \"umami\"! Reality: Very good though nothing incredible. The broth was a tad too oily for my liking and not as flavorful as advertised. I ordered the special so it came with ajitsuke-tamago (flavored egg), char siew cubes and bamboo shoots. I personally prefer my ramen eggs to be on the slightly runny side and the yolk in this one was 75% hardened. The char siew slices that came in the ramen itself was fantastic (soft and flavorful), but the cubes were a a little too dry and hardened. It's hard to get bamboo shoots wrong so I finished all of that. I don't care much for ramen noodles themselves, so I won't comment on the texture or quality. Overall, I'd say Ippudo is a dependable brand of ramen. I'd compare it to Starbucks maybe - decent and consistent but not memorable. Just like how if you really wanted a special kind of coffee you'd go to a family-owned caf\u00e9, if you really a special bowl of ramen, you'd go for those hole-in-the-wall places, ideally run entirely by Japanese staff.",

Well, if you're able to slide in at 4:30PM, you'll be treated to no queue and pretty much have your pick of the tables. Located on the 4th of Mandarin Gallery, it follows suit with the mall's equally pricey options. Their regular ramen starts from $15, not including Singapore's ++ Syndrome (7% GST + 10% Service Charge)I really like the fact that they ask for your noodle texture preference - soft, medium or hard! I dunno about you, but I'm pretty picky about enjoying my noodles al dente. Medium texture is perfect for that! To be honest, the taste of the ramen itself is probably only worth about 3 stars. The broth is incredibly rich and borderline too fatty & oily. The portions are probably not worth the price but hey, you're technically paying for the brand! The real standout is actually the char siu pork - so flavourful and tender! The extra star goes out to the staff who were super sweet that day. I accidentally left my camera at the table and they actually came out of the restaurant to try and find me. After I realised what had happened, I went back and they had kept my camera safely at the front counter for me. Really appreciated that gesture and it was one of those rare instances that I didn't mind the extra service charge one bit!",

    "text": "While the broth is a hearty and soothing highlight to the dishes here, I don't find the overall experience to be much better than any other high-end ramen place. I recommend the pan-fried gyoza for an appetizer. The spicy version of the traditional soup was preferred over the original, although the broth was great for both. Oddly, the higher-priced spicy soup comes with no meat in it (well there were some tiny slivered pieces of fat, but not anything you could reasonably call meat), while I was expecting those large medallions of pork that come in most ramen bowls. At $18-25 a bowl, a good broth alone just doesn't cut it. Furthermore, the dining area is quite loud because the entire staff shouts at everyone who walks in the door. It's one thing to greet people at the door, like many Japanese restaurants do, but this is like an uproar of indistinguishable noise that continues throughout your meal.",

There was no wait, but by the time we finished, there was definitely a long line! Moving from NY with the extremely, long-wait but delicious Ippudo there and having tried the disappointing no-wait Ippudo Tao in SG, I wanted to give the main SG Ippudo a chance. I ordered the Akamaru Tamago and the pork bun. The ramen was very good and definitely redeemed my thoughts about Ippudo in Singapore. The pork bun was a bit underwhelming having tried the pork belly buns in NY...perhaps it was because the NY ones were pork belly instead of just pork...the fat really must've made the difference haha.I would definitely come back at an odd time to avoid the wait again. This is probably not the best ramen but it's up there. The service was attentive and my water was always being re-filled (I love when I don't have to flag down someone to re-fill water!).",

I tend to want to check out ramen places and pho places no matter what city I'm in, just to benchmark. I'm glad I did here.Good, savory broth, noodles cooked perfectly, zero complaints on that front. I didn't know what to expect, reading it was \"hakata\" style, but was pleasantly surprised, especially knowing I was trying ramen out in a mall (which in the US, is usually a recipe for a blech kind of ramen experience). Paired our ramen with gyoza, which was perfectly seared and fried. As I so often do, I benchmark against Santa Ramen and Ramen Dojo here in the Bay Area. This place isn't as good as those, but it's a place I would most definitely come back to the next time I come back to Singapore. Don't let the fact that it's in a mall predispose you against giving it a try. It won't knock your socks off with a two by four, but it's good, decent ramen.",

    "text": "I'm personally not a huge ramen fan but Ippudo's dishes were as authentic as it could be. You can choose the texture of noodles (soft, medium, hard) for each ramen and customize the toppings. We also ordered the cucumber appetizer that my friend recommended and we're glad we ordered it as it was a good refresher from the creamy ramen broth. Peak hour is from 6:30pm- 8pm so go early if you want to beat the line. Would recommend it for casual dining!",
