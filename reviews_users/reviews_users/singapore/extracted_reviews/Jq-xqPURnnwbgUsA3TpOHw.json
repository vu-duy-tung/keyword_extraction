We ordered 1 salad, 1 dinner set, and 1 baked razor clam, which was just good portions for 2 people.The sashimi that came with the dinner set was fresh and tasty. The only complaint was that the baked salmon was overcooked. The tempura has a good crunchiness and wasn't too oily.Overall, it was a good dinner.",

    "text": "Good japanese restaurants can charge a lot for their fare, but Fukuichi offers really fresh and good quality sashimi at reasonable prices. It's still pricier than an average meal, but it's worth the little extra.I will always have the salmon, fatty tuna, scallops and swordfish sashimi when I am there. When sea urchin sashimi is available, I order that too. The sashimi is very sweet and fresh, and only requires a small amount of soy sauce and wasabi. I will also order the crabstick tofu with century egg as a starter. The century egg sauce is creamy and complements the tofu perfectly, with the crabstick and spring onions giving it an added texture.Of the cooked dishes, my favourites are the following. The miso eggplant was delightful, soft and mushy with a really tasty miso sauce baked on top of it. The beef with foie gras comes with 3 pieces of tender beef and matching portions of foie gras in a sweet sauce. The ambience here is agreeable, especially if you get a seat outdoors on a cool night. They have a bar equipped with a wide variety of sake, shochu and beer to wash your meal down. The food is served up fairly quickly, but it can be a challenge to get someone's attention if you are sitting outside. Be sure to take advantage of the credit card promotions for a discount!Do make sure you make a reservation if you are planning to go for dinner over the weekend! It's also a little bit difficult to find due to the strange architecture of the building, but look out for the directory for a map.",

    "text": "Kind of a more modern Japanese restaurant than the traditional one. Thus, fusion dishes can sometimes be more confusion.We are a huge group so we tried many dishes. The signature appetizer is the century egg tofu. Interesting, but a tad too salty for me, and definitely not classically Japanese. The restaurant is supposedly opened by a company who is a seafood wholesaler and they supplies to the famed fish markets in Japan. Thus, the seafood is definitely fresh. While I cannot fault the freshness of the seafood, we all know that to make the great leap to awesome Japanese food, the quality is just one part, the chef's skill is the tipping point. This place miss the cut for that.But that said, the price point is great. You get value for money and if you like to experiment with modern Japanese, this may be a good place to check out while in town. Think beef with foie gras sauce. It is also located just off the main belt, so it is not so crazy busy and has a nice open rooftop overlooking the street. Great for an evening of sake and decent Japanese food.",

    "text": "We thought the sushi was just OK and the almond ebi tempura, though unique in concept and presentation, wasn't really that great. The bamboo clams with cod roe sauce was OK, quite ordinary ... I actually prefer it the way most Chinese seafood restaurants do it so one can taste the sweetness and freshness of the bamboo clams although I guess Fukuichi was trying to add a new dimension to a normal dish.Kudos to the boss and team for trying to give a new fusion modern twist to normal Japanese fare, though this can be sometimes a bit of a hit and miss.Service was pretty good.",

    "text": "Fukuichi \u00a0is among the priciest Japanese places I have been to in Singapore; if it weren't for the fact that I have yet to discover a reasonably-priced quality Japanese restaurant in Singapore, I probably would not have returned to Fukuichi so many times. Alas.The sashimi here is good, and the fish is supposedly air flown from Shizuoka, but at these prices, I'd rather go to Fish Mart Sakuraya. What I come for are their non-traditional stuff, like the seared maguro maki rolls and the almond crusted prawn tempura. Their baked prawn is very tasty, but even more memorable is their grilled black cod with miso paste. On the less memorable side, their Japanese-style yong tau foo was plain boring. Chicken karaage and tori katsu were standard as well. Their dinner set bentos are very good value, and I'm told the grilled eel is remarkable.For dessert, ice cream mochi is on the house, although I did try their peach ice cream, which had a Ferroro Rocher filling. The dessert looked more special than it tasted, but worth trying once.The prices are quite steep, usually at $60+ per person, excluding alcohol. If you stick to the dinner set bento, you can get away with under $50 a person. The ambiance is a little casual given these prices, but service is consistently attentive. A decent place to splurge on once in a while.",

Prices are reasonable, quality of food is awesome fresh and service here is efficient and top-notch. None of the immature lame snooty service at other restaurants marring the country. \u00a0- Cold crab century egg silken tofu: might be the best appetizer i've ever eaten in my entire life. So amazing. I had 2 big servings this last time i visited- Beef over charcoal grill: Wow. Tender and melts in your mouth like butter. truly amazing- Udon cooked over charcoal grill: It looks like a miracle (cooked in rice paper over a grill) and tastes like udon heaven- Sashimi/ Sushi: with everything else on the table, this was probably the most 'normal' dish @ FukuichiI hope more wannabe-Japanese hispters diss this place on Yelp; leave the restaurant to me, my family and friends.",

    "text": "great japanese, and one of the best deals about town for a good meal at reasonable prices. this place, I've known about for a long time, but only recently had the chance to visit - and then we went twice in just as many weeks.prices are surprisingly good for japanese food at this quality, the cooking is expert and the food comes fast - highly recommended.it's difficult to find a really good mid-range japanese restaurant now - there's a large unoccupied chasm between between the cheaper chains (though I love them) and the posher japanese joints where you get your sushi warmed by the hands of the chef (and your wallets emptied by the skill of their cashiers), and so my excitement over this place is both right and just. the star of both our meals was the corn tempura. I couldn't get a good shot of it (I'm so sorry), but it was a revelation: sweet nubblets of corn suspended in a light crispy batter interspersed with chopped shiso leaves - no grease, and completely addictive. you must order it - we had two baskets of it at both meals.the reasonably-priced part here comes with a caveat - the \u00e0 la carte is priced a little high, though nowhere near that of japanese-restaurants-in-hotels - the best value-for-money option is to go for their bento sets. it isn't a really difficult choice, by any means - the bentos come with a permutation of sashimi, tempura and cooked items, all of which are very good.the beef is my favourite: a long slab of tender beef in a deep, dark sauce that goes brilliantly with rice. the salmon set is a little less stellar, though still pretty tasty - I think the salmon might have been a bit too firm with overcooking.one of the most impressively-priced (in a good way) and reasonably-portioned dinners I've had in the orchard area for a while now (almost akin to the japanese cousin of the angus steakhouse) - well and truly recommended.",
