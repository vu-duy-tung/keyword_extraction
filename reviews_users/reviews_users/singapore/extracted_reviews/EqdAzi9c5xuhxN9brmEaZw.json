The food is always good, maybe not amazing but but I've always been greeted with a smile, received my food quickly and been checked on to make sure things were to my liking. The waiters are always friendly and the prices aren't bad for the location. If you're looking for a solid laid back Mexican place, this is a great option. Ask for Jessy, she's the best!!",

So all of the aforementioned made the dining experience quite nice.As far as the food goes it's all pretty OKAY. I tried the shredded beef burrito, red snapper burrito, quesadillas, nachos, and churros. Everything was a pretty good rendition of what I'm used to back home in Texas, but nothing really could compare to even middle of the road tex-mex places. However based upon the standard of Mexican food in Singapore, it's not bad. The drinks were pretty weak though, I could barely taste the tequila.This restaurant is really over priced though. Expect to spend around $30-45 a head for just an entree and not much more. Overall I wouldn't mind going again, but the pricing and food isn't overall good enough to make this a regular spot for me.",

At night the place is crowded with chatter and an alfresco dining concept. I had the chicken chimichanga which is sort of like a fried burrito, which was not bad, but nothing to shout about. Portions are huge, so bringing an appetite is a must. Overall I might come back here again for a Mexican fix, but only because there's not many other good Mexican places.",

You can definitely tell it is a Mexican restaurant as soon as you step close to the greeter podium - the Latin music that gets your feet doing a little dance and the Mother of Mary statue standing tall just behind the cashier. The menu is pretty typical Mexican food - burritos, fajitas and they have free flow of chips and salsa! Gotta love that chips and salsa since that is pretty rare to come across in Singapore. I ordered a plate of green chili stew. My first impression - is this what we ordered? If you are used to the more traditional green chili stew, this dish will not live up to your expectations. It DOES NOT look or taste anything like green chili stew AT ALL. BUT, I do have to give them a thumbs up for that dish because it was a pretty flavorful stew. It tasted more like a meat and potato stew with Mexican spices. The stew came with salted steamed black beans and Spanish rice. They also served it with a side of two tortilla. I would definitely get this dish again on my next visit. You just have to not expect the traditional way here. Go adventure!",

But it was (and still is) very festive and authentic. Plus, I didn't know of any other Mexican restaurants in Singapore - so it was quite the routine - to go there and have a jug of margaritas (to share, or, er... not) and Mexican fare.What I Love: They have great drinks. Their margarita flavors are pretty cool. A jug is $57 from 8-11pm. But if you get one after, it's like $39 or something? Which is quite a deal actually. I like that they have half-price and Post Happy Hour prices. They have a pretty cool comprehensive menu detailing their Half-Price discounts. I LOVE their menu - its comprehensive, easy to read and clear. Their drinks and tequila menu is pretty great too. Have tried their Quesadillas, Fajitas, Tortillas, and other stuff that's pretty darn good. Try and explore the menu!What I Don't Love: Their prices. Can get pretty steep. Good to share.",

I would recommend 1. Margaritas (might be bias towards this)2. Chips & SalsaTips: Happy hour! 1. Before 8pm, drinks are priced cheaper. 2. After 11 pm drinks are 30 - 40% off. The place can get super crowded on the weekends and they use to not take reservations but now I see a widget for it so maybe they finally have decided to embrace technology! hurray!",

I always order the tacos either fish or chicken and both are excellent. They give you three large tacos, too much for one person plus rice and black beans. The Mexican rice is quite authentic and the beans have a good flavor with a hint of lime. Surprisingly they give free chips and salsa and free refills in soft drinks ( not common in SG). The salsa has a bit of smokey chipotle flavor and decent chips. For those that have posted that the chips were soggy, mine have always come crisp but with Singapore humidity it doesn't take long for them to soften up. The tacos are around $25 but there is enough food for two. I do recommend it as my favorite place for Mexican food in Singapore.",

We ordered the pork green chile with rice and beans to share. The dish that came out did not at all resemble green chile, instead appearing red with a thick, milky consistency. I'm not sure if we got the wrong thing or if they don't have the same impression of what pork green chile is. Nevertheless, we were quite pleased by the spices and hearty flavor of the dish. The side tortillas made nice for wrapping up black beans, rice, and the chile together. The black beans were standard without any special sauce or seasoning. The rice was no longer white, but still very bland in flavor, as is customary in many Mexican restaurants. Overall, the chile was quite good. Along with the chips and sides, this made for a good light two-person lunch. Note that this place has differential margarita pricing throughout the day, so it pays to start first thing in the morning and pass out shortly after noon.",

Yay:Chips and salsa - free and delicious Guacamole side - quite yums and flavorful Calamari: nicely fried, awesome sauce Quesadilla with chicken $21 - I love melted cheese! Decent fish, nothing wow or meh about it NahChimichangas - dough quite thick, so so stuffing, too much sour cream Pork carnitas tacos - not the pulled pork I expected, but still yummy pork chunks. Taco skin was a fail. 2 out of 3 skins were abandoned Nachos $20 - overloaded with ingredients, must be shared by 4 or more otherwise wont be finished, chips were very thick unlike the free bowl which was nicer and crispier If I will be back it'll be for the happy hour original/peach magaritas (which was beyond sad after it melted in an hour) and the one tiny bowl of chips and salsa. Nice chill out atmosphere along Singapore River at Riverside Point.

Salsa not up to my usual standards (I am picky) but chips were fresh and plentiful. Hand mixed margaritas and they carry Brewerkz craft beer (sister restaurant), and have lively piped in music. I had the chicken chimichangas and they were quite good. Chunky pieces of chicken rather than shredded but that gave it a unique flavor. Staff was very friendly. WillCome again.",

The evening view of the riverside bridges and buildings made it a very tranquil environment.I ordered the Mini Chimichanga made with chicken as an appetizer. And for the main course I ordered the chicken fajitas. Everything was served timely and hot. The ingredients were fresh & tasty. I tried three different margaritas. Remand they have so many more selections of them. \u00a0Premium margarita was great and cooling.Tried their Patron margaritas with raspberry and the last one was Pink guava. The price was very reasonable. And from 10pm till closing the margaritas are half off their house selection. Can't wait to come here again. Very satisfied and happy!!!!!!",

    "text": "With a good selection of Mexican special cocktails and Margaritas, it is not surprising to see that business is booming even on a Tuesday night. The Red Snapper Burritos ($25) made a stunning entrance like a curvy oblong-shaped parcel, only to reveal a luscious interior of fish, borraco beans, Mexican rice and strands of Mozzarella-cheddar melting mid-way. This could be a potentially great dish if the snapper was not too dry. Puerco en Chile Verde ($14) sounded exotic but it striked a nostalgic chord even if you had not experience any Mexican life before. There isn't so much firepower in this spicy pork stew. But being thick and warm, it goes ideally with the toasted tortillas or simply a direct fast track into your mouth. How does having some tequila in your seafood sounds? The Prawn Brochette ($35) is a skewer of roughly 5-6 lime marinated prawns with smoky tequila glaze, served with grilled vegetables on a stick. It has a heady aroma, though the glaze was short of the wild character of liquor. Nonetheless, the Tequila glaze was an instant hit with the 1/2 Chicken ($28) as the toasty caramelized taste emerged from the skin which retained the moisture of the meat.  The standout dish was the Shredded Steak Chimchangas ($25), a golden crispy flour tortilla that is deep-fried to perfection such that it kept the juicy strands of beef warm and comfortable while displaying resilience any sogginess. Drenched in generous amount of sour cream and guacamole, this giant plate of meaty \"Popiah\" roll is messy but speaks right to your soul. I don't fancy banana desserts but I may have to take back my statement on the Banana Chimichangas ($14) here. Just like the earlier savoury chimichanga, the filling is substituted with bananas, deep fried till the shell turned into a crunchy fritter. Wallop a huge scoop of fragrant and buttery avocado ice cream and you'll get something that is ten times better than any chocolate lava cake or any hot-cold dessert. There is also the Sauteed Kahlua-glazed Bananas ($14) for those who are less keen on deep-fried food. This ain't no flouncy haute style ala minute flamb\u00e9 bananas but a rustic tropical dessert that sits on a rich and decadent sauce. Other selections include a gluten-free Ancho Chile Chocolate Cake ($14) and Churros ($12) but the former two banana desserts are more satisfying for the bucks and calories.Spice-wise, the dishes are tuned to a temperate palette, yet there were moments during the feast when I thought I was eating Indian briyani. No wonder they say that Indian and Mexican cuisine are actually quite similar! In fact, I was told that about 50% of the customers are Indians. Well, there are three different kinds of authentic Mexican hot sauces aplenty of the table for you to adjust the heat to your preference. Both indoors and outdoors seating are non-air-conditioned but I highly recommend the indoors seating if you want to enjoy the food heartily away from any outdoor smoking.",

However the food really really let me down.I'm convinced that the guy in the kitchen has never had a real burrito in his life. What came out was a dry, chewy flour-filled abomination that barely resembled one. The enchiladas were not much better. They arrived slathered in cheese, but the taste was barely registering on my tongue. I was left clutching the bottle of habanero sauce attempting to add some zing to what was left sitting on my plate.Maybe my expectations are elevated cos of the years living in CA, visiting the local taco stand, and crossing the border into TJ.I'm wondering how this place gets 4 stars... Maybe it's the margaritas talking.",

The food is pretty darn good, the service is as good (even on a Friday night) and the location and ambiance are first rate - no question the location makes the experience even better. We started with the chips and salsa, ordered some guacamole and had the chimichangas - all were served promptly and the chimichangas (beef) were tasty. I had the chicken fajitas (which arrived sizzling hot and with ample veggies and salsa, guava and sour cream) and my Wife had the beef burrito. All of which were really good (and portions excellent). We had the little ones with us and the staff was also pretty fun with them as well. I'll go back! It's a fun place to spend an evening and you can leave satisfied with your meal!",

    "text": "New menu and none the better. The margaritas are still fantastic and the setting on the Singapore River is lovely, but the food is in steady decline. \u00a0We ate on a very quiet Sunday evening. Jumbo, the restaurant next to Cafe Iguana, was packed, but we were one of only a few active tables at Cafe Iguana.The meal started with flavorless and exceptionally cold (a theme for the meal) salsa. The refrigerated salsa tasted like pureed tomatoes with little added to that. Tortilla chips without any salt or flavoring at all on them and the free appetizer seems designed to keep people from wanting seconds.I had the shrimp burrito with the oddly named carne de puerco en chile verde. On the positive side, the pork green chili stew was the best thing on the table all night. Genuinely delicious albeit oddly named as there was absolutely nothing green about it. Very standard reddish brown chili/stew color without any visible green capsicum or anything green. \u00a0Sadly, the burrito itself was a huge disappointment... very few shrimp (but those that were there tasted pretty good) mixed with isolated clumps of different ingredients (i.e., so you get several servings of nothing but beans, followed by one serving of nothing but shrimp, etc.) on a tortilla that was mostly raw and topped (after \"cooking\") with raw (unmelted) cheese (see photo).The kids had the mini tostadas and a quesadilla. \u00a0Both were mostly left on the plate.The taco salad did little to resemble a taco or its typical ingredients. Essentially a load of plain lettuce sitting on a pancake flat raw tortilla with a dab of sour creme hidden under the tortilla that my wife didn't even find until after she stopped eating. Only about a third of the salad was eaten. \u00a0Finally, service was painfully slow and we had to ask four times to get someone to bring a glass of water. What used to be an almost iconic Mexican restaurant in Singapore has matured into a tired and uninspired disappointment.",

Quesadillas, fajitas, tortillas etc. are all aplenty. I also like the grilled prawns on the hotplate thing.The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, and the decor unique.
