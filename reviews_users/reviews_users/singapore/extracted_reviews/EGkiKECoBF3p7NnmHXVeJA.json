    "text": "Shanghai Dumpling aka Xiao Long Bao. \u00a0For years I've been seeing people declare that the best Xiao Long Bao is from Din Tai Fung. \u00a0Unfortunately, there are no Din Tai Fungs in Hawaii. \u00a0Apparently, Din Tai Fung seems to be all over the place in Singapore. \u00a0I think I saw at least 4 while out there. \u00a0This review is for the one at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. \u00a0During our first visit at this mall, the crowd waiting outside of Din Tai Fung was crazy. \u00a0I would estimate at least 50 people waiting. \u00a0So we passed on eating there are we thought it would be an hour wait at a minimum. \u00a0A couple of days later, we're back at the mall and my brother tells us to try it. \u00a0Again, there was a huge crowd waiting outside. \u00a0We're quoted a 20 minute wait... not too bad.... Unbelievably, I think the wait was closer to 15 minutes! \u00a0These guys are totally on it and they are fast. \u00a0(While you're waiting they give you a sheet that you can start marking off your order choices. \u00a0I'm sure this cuts down on time as a result.) We had the Xiao Long Bao (of course!) \u00a0It was excellent. \u00a0The juices inside were still liquid and not reabsorbed like all the other dim sum places. \u00a0Perfect!To be honest, the rest of the drunken chicken, spinach dumplings, etc. were as expected. Everything came out hot, delicious and freshly made. \u00a0Service was excellent. \u00a0It was a great lunch and if you go, do not be deterred by the crowds outside.",

Service was good and attentive and thy were pleasant even though we were the last to leave and it was late.",

Yum. \u00a0Also the Xiaolongbao are not to be missed. \u00a0Basically a pork ball and broth in a steamed dumpling skin. \u00a0 You pop it in your mouth and it breaks open into deliciousness. The chili crab buns and the shumai were great too. \u00a0Living in San Francisco I have access to pretty good Dim Sum, but this was better than I get in SF at any price, and better than several other recommended places I've had dim sum in SG too.",

Unfortunately, it was prime time lunch time, so there was an hour wait, but it was nothing that we weren't trained for back home. \u00a0I really don't think you can order wrong at Din Tai Fung. \u00a0We got another order of the steamed pork dumplings, tried the golden fried prawn pancakes, \u00a0yelp.com/biz_photos/din-\u2026 and the fried rice with pork chop. \u00a0yelp.com/biz_photos/din-\u2026 They were all winners. \u00a0The prawn pancakes are like Asian fishcake except it's shrimp, battered with breadcrumbs and fried. \u00a0The fried rice and pork chop was basically Taiwanese tonkatsu.They ran out of the steamed chili crab and pork buns. \u00a0Sadface.Service is efficient, though I wish they would refill the pot of complimentary premium jasmine tea quicker because I drink like a camel.I love Din Tai Fung. \u00a0Especially since we didn't have to leave the MBS at all, and I love that even if we did, there are 14 locations in Singapore alone to choose from.",

The dumplings: delicate, and the wrapper was beautiful and tasty. The filling was meant to be savored and rolled over the tongue. Gotta say they didn't disappoint.

Their xiao long bao is best for its skin, very thin and delicate, but the flavor is not so good, nor the meat inside. i like paradize dynasty more for its flavor but their skins are also thicker. Ding tai fung now also does the truffle flavor like paradise dynasty. i still like their hong you chao shou, but the Taipei HQ is so much better and spicier than this branch. Other side dishes such as veggies are okay but not very special.",

It did not disappoint.The wait is pretty considerable, but given that it was in the Shoppes at MBS I expected a decent amount of people to be waiting. As with everything else in Singapore, the queue was orderly and the complete opposite of what goes on Stateside.Once seated though, the food was more than well worth the wait (also helps that you can select what you want to eat ahead of time while waiting). We did not go home hungry. Ordering what I typically get in the US (pork xiao long bao & shrimp shumai) was a good starting point to compare - consistently great. What surprised me were some of the menu items I hadn't seen yet (and needed to try). The pork and chili crab dumplings were amazing. But the truffle dumpling was absolutely phenomenal. Not sure if it was just from the amount of food eaten, but this place made me happy. It was like a rush of dopamine/serotonin/endorphins just flooded my system. Amazing, phenomenal comfort food wrapped in little pillow-y pieces of dough.",

Nice, soft texture yet with soup inside and the pork mixture excellent with the vinegar. Also tried the dan dan noodles, excellent flavour. Overall was an experience which was excellent. Hope the melbourne one gets better",

We ordered the large crate of Xiao Long Bao, Dan Dan noodles, and the Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Soup. The Xiao Long Bao was our personal favorite. They were amazing! The broth on the inside was so flavorful! We could have probably eaten our entire body weight in Xiao Long Baos! A close second was the dan dan noodles. The sesame flavoring was particularly strong in this version but I didn't mind it! Added some chili oil to make it spicy and it was yummy! The noodle soup was nothing special. Broth was good. The noodles were the exact same ones as the ones in the dan dan noodles. Wasn't blown away but there wasn't anything to really complain about either! Would definitely come back again to try other things on the menu!",

Wait time, service, attention to detail, promptness, and taste all seem to have some slight differences- this specific one is very keen on efficient customer service. This DTF does not have proper AC. It's very stuffy inside. Aside from that, there's nothing really to complain about. The place is managed well- take a number, walk MBS around for 45-60 minutes, come back, and get seated. Maybe a 30 minute wait for your orders to arrive. Like every other worldwide DTF location, you can gawk at the kitchen workers making the dumplings through the window. I still have an appreciation for the level of detail that goes into each individual dumpling, but I do not distinguish these XLB's or dumplings to be better or worse than the other DTF's I've been to. My main local DTF is in Bellevue, WA (USA), and it has one noticeable difference. The kitchen workers speak Spanish to one another, as opposed to Mandarin! !jajaja! (that's Spanish for laughter)But yeah, I'm DTF for some Din Tai Fung.",

I could see people started coming in here for lunch and there was already a wait outside the restaurant. FOOD 4/5Din Tai Fung \u9f0e\u6cf0\u4e30 is famous for their xiao long bao, it's also my favorite dish to order from here. I could just eat xiao long bao and nothing else. However, we girls ordered the followings:1) Xiao Long Bao 5/5*It's Din Tai Fung's famous signature rendition of the traditional steamed dumplings. The dumplings here consist of juicy meat fillings wrapped in melt-in-your-mouth paper thin skin. Each dumpling is supposed to be made with a minimum of 18 exquisite folds. Personally, xiao long bao the best at Din Tai Fung \u9f0e\u6cf0\u4e30 ;)2) Sliced Duck in Crispy Spring Onion Pastry 3/5*The smoked duck inside the crispy pastry did nothing to me. I actually really dislike this dish among all the dishes we ordered. I do like the crispy spring onion pastry though. 3) Fried Rice with Shrimps & Eggs 5/5*The fried rice was so fragrant with the eggs and it was a simple rice dish yet it was really delicious. The fried rice was not loaded with heavy seasonings so the ingredients really shine through. Shrimps tasted fresh.4) Deep-Fried Specially Marinated Pork Chop 4/5*The boneless pork chop was well marinated and very tender. I like it but it did not blow my socks off. Meaning? I may not order this again in future. I would still recommend this dish though. 5) Mango Pudding 4/5*Again, this mango pudding was very good. It was not the best I had (maybe it had to do with the consistency)but it was the only dessert I would order here. I could see real pieces of mangoes inside, the pudding was sweet and I did not detect anything artificial. *rating out of 5AMBIENCE 4/5There is nothing intimate at any Din Tai Fung \u9f0e\u6cf0\u4e30. It is for families and friends. I have no complaints about the ambience. Lively or noisy. I just concentrate on eating :PSERVICE 4/5The staffs who brought our food were all so nice and polite. Hard to get a staff's attention, my friend needed to order more food. I felt for her. Lol!! I never like to wave or wave frantically to staffs for their attention. Hmmm.. for some reason, i think I like the DTF's location at Orchard better.",

What I didnt know is that there are several locations and we ended up visiting two of them during our short stay.This location has an interesting concept where you first visit the hostess to tell her how many people are in your party and are given a ticket with a number. Then before your number is called you need to fill out on the order sheet what you would like to eat. Its a bit difficult your first time here because there are no descriptions for the items and theres only one photo menu that people were fighting over. Once your order is called you turn in your order sheet and are escorted to a table where they tell you how long until your order is ready. For us it was 30 minutes, but it really came in about 20. The orders come out one at a time when they are ready, which was great because as soon as we finished one the next was being presented. The service was very fast and food quality was fantastic. Highly recommend!",

Where's the pork flavor? Where's the salt? Taipei and Shanghai branches weren't like this, how did you guys mess up your signature item? Pork with crab dumplings - Slightly less flavorless due to the crab, but still can't call it \"good\". Pork chop and fried rice - pork chop is under salted, has a weird sour taste? The rice is well executed, about the only good thing during this meal.Tea - decent, but instead of giving it to you in a pot like in Taipei, they give you a cup, and it is VERY hard to holler down a waiter to refill the teaSteamed pork rice siumai - also flavorless. Like wtf are they doing, do these chefs not have tongues anymore? Can't they taste their own food and see that they are severely lacking? Stir fried Dou Miao - A different variety of doumiao compared to the ones in China, but it would have been fine if it tasted good. It did not.Chili crab dumplings - It's basically just ground pork with some chili crab flavoring, hard pass. I would rather eat chili crab flavored instant noodles. Honestly, if they remembered to add salt, the meal would be at least two stars. But nope, one star for you, DTF Marina Bay Sands.",

The dumpling skin was very thin and delicate, yet sturdy, and the pork inside was delicious, juicy, and succulent, but the soup could have been more flavorful. The steamed chili crabs filled buns, another one of DTF's specialty items, were very filling. The crabmeat had a bit of mild heat that didn't linger because the fluffy bun helped soothe the spicy sensation quickly. Despite the restaurant not at full capacity around 11am on a Saturday, the service felt a little slow but were kind nonetheless. My first experience at a DTF was more than satisfactory, and I would dine at the other international branches if I get the chance.",

    "text": "As someone who frequents din tai fung outlets all over the world, this particular store was extremely disappointing. The service was particularly bad for 8 PM on a Monday. Our order of the standard xiaolongbao arrived more than 45 minutes after all of our other food arrived. In addition to being very late, all of the xiaolongbao were over cooked and the meat had a grainy texture to it. Our empty plates and steamers stayed on the side of our table for the entirety of the meal, and our tea and water were hardly ever refilled. All in all easily the worst experiences I've had at this chain.",

    "text": "Love love dumplings here. We try to go to din tai fung in every Asian country they can be found in. They all have something that's special on the menu. In Singapore it's the crab dumplings. They were good just like the pork dumplings. The mother of all dumplings is the black truffle pork dumplings. It's quite a bit more expensive but you will not regret it.",

I recommend the crab and pork soup dumplings and the crispy duck rolls.",

I highly approved of \u00a0their efficient \"take a number\" system, where they assign you a number and give you a menu to fill out while you wait.While the service initially was a bit slow, we really enjoyed our meal once the food started coming out. We all shared an assortment of steamed dumplings and buns and a bowl of dumpling noodle soup - all of which were awesome! The meal favorites for me were the pork, chicken, and vegetable dumplings. That being said, nothing we ordered was disliked. You can't go wrong at this place!",
