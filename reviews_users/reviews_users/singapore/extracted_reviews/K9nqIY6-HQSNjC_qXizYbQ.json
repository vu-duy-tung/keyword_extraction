    "text": "Highly recommend! Not a big fan of bagels but this little place changed that. No doubt it was made just a few minutes earlier, it was so fresh. Just wish I would have discovered them when I first got here instead of on my last day here. Coffee beans were fresh and very flavourful. They use a local roaster and the roast date for your coffee is shown. Mine was within the last 10 days, so just about perfect. To top it off, every staff member was super nice and accommodating; a rarity it seems. Breakfast lunch or dinner would be great here.",

    "text": "Eighteen days into a three week swing through Asia, I was done with hotel breakfast buffets. I wanted a breakfast that hadn't been under a warming light or in a steam tray. Fortunately, when I checked into the delightful Courtyard by Marriott Novena, the young lady at the bell desk on the ground floor told me I had to try this place. Given that it was about 20 steps from the front door, this was a no-brainer.This was just what I needed, and more. The bagel at 8 am was still warm from the oven and the schmears were cool and tasty. The menu told me that I was coming back, and tomorrow I'm buying for the office. Two Men Bagel House has redefined the quick breakfast in Singapore. As long as they are here, I am staying nearby.",

This one alongside their other location in my old stomping grounds in Tanjong Pagar serve the only bagels in Singapore that I consistently come back to.Highly recommend you come here for any bagel craving you have as you really won't find any better on the island.The location is pretty cool, all outdoor or bar like seating. They don't take credit cards so be wary of that - only cash and NETS.",
