Particularly, go for those thinly sliced one that are slightly frozen and rolled up. I have no idea what it's called.The price for this? $26 per person. Can't find anything to complain about with that price.Don't forget to pick up an ice cream on your way out.",

    "text": "Not worth the $25+ in my opinion. Prepared food seems kind of.. Old, and the grilled meats are mostly tough and indiscernible from each other. Definitely not a good sign! The cooking stations also point to the kind of experience you'll have. You and your eating mates will be working with worn down mini stoves covered in tin foil. Not the look I'm going when paying that much money for Korean BBQ! I've had far better BBQ elsewhere. I'd suggest you try your luck somewhere else as well.",

    "text": "Your typical Korean BBQ buffet place. Meat here is self served, and pretty well marinated. However, since the restaurant is rather small (only the second floor serves buffet, if I'm not wrong), the ventilation is pretty bad. I walked out of there feeling satisfied, but disgusted at the same time since I could feel my hair, face and clothes all grimy from the BBQ smoke, and I probably smelled like the food I just ate. Also, service here is non-existent since it is a popular and cheap restaurant which is understaffed :( I'd pay more to eat at a better restaurant, or try out their ala-carte menu instead!",

As it is a buffet setting and Korean BBQ are famous for their meat, meat lovers will rejoice here. COMPLETE ribs (yes, I mean COMPLETE, not those poor excuses of ribs they stir fry at zi char stores) for you to cut up while BBQ-ing it, thick slabs of beef or pork, chicken strips and the fresh vegetables to make yourself lie to your body that you are countering the oily goodness by wrapping it with the leaf of the cabbage... don't forget the kimchi as well. All of that for the price of $26 per person (give or take with GST) with drinks included. When I feel like indulging in a meat fest, I will definitely be back here in a heartbeat for more BBQ goodness.",

I love free extras. True Chinese.Another favorite is the Sul Lung Tang (Beef Brisket Stew) which is a perfect hangover cure. Add some sea salt, spring onions, and rice in the soup and you have yourself a great cure. \u00a0Other gripe is they don't have kkakdugi, the essential kimchi accompaniment for SLT.",

    "text": "Coming from LA where korean food is of utmost abundance, it was a struggle to find food korean food in Singapore. However, thank God for 2D1N! I would easily say this is one of the best, more authentic korean restaurants in Singapore. I believe they have all-you-can-eat locations in Novena and Chinatown too, however, this has been my favorite location so far (without the all-you-can-eat, because quality tends to be better). I have been there on several occasions, with small groups as well as big groups and each time did not disappoint. There can be a little bit of a wait here so I'd advise you to go early. Food wise, we've tried everything from the BBQ meats, Kimchi Jjigae, Doenjang Jjigae, Bo Ssam Pork Belly (steamed pork with wraps) as well as various other stews and can I just say - incredibly legit. The restaurant is set up with partitions so you pretty much get your own little \"room\" which is nice and private. But, don't expect it to be quiet - it's not! But that's kind of what ends to the fun night-out atmosphere. Add some Soju along with your meal and it almost feels like you're back in LA's Koreatown!",

They don't take dinner reservations so you have to queue and be there when they call your number for seating!I suppose \"2d1n\" is the name of some Korean pop group. It's very Korean and memorable nonetheless. Since I used to work at Duxton, I had the fortune of trying their lunch sets, which is really affordable and delicious!For 9.90-10.90, you get to choose from sets like spicy hot plate pork or kimchi noodles. My favorite is the pork. It comes with rice, at least 3 side dishes (can be refilled), kimchi, kelp soup, a bottle of water and iced lemon tea!The seating is also quite unique as they have rooms for slightly larger groups. You then call for service by pressing a button.I would say skip the dinner, and try their lunch instead when you can!",

The place is always crowded, noisy and pretty much no aircon. The reason why it is still such a popular dining area is because of the cheap and good food that they provide.The meat portions are huge and marinated well! Much better than those in Seoul Garden. For Kpop fans, you get to indulge in some Kpop fever during your time there as they play Kpop songs and even have posters of your idols around the shop.Wear comfortable clothes and for the ladies, tie up your hair before you start feasting on the variety of food at 2D1N Souju Bang",

Although the place had no air-conditioners, there were 4 fans blasting at our table, and so we did not have any complaints regarding the relative stuffiness of the place. Korean music videos were played continuously on the large television screens, and posters of Korean stars were pasted everywhere. Overall, there was a general Korean feel emanating from the place-many Koreans were there dining, and the place was just overflowing with its culture and unique flavours. The BBQ meal cost us $23.50 each, and we had a variety of food to fill ourselves that night-Bulgogi chicken, beef, pork. Personally, the meat was either too fatty, too oily or not chewy enough, but the food galore occupied my friends' innards, minds and hearts the whole time. Meat lovers would love this place, but for those not too fond of meat and only meat, be prepared to leave feeling a little unsettled. Even though we did not drink. this seems like a really great place to have a bottle or two of Soju with friends before calling it a day, or night. Opening hours: Mon-Fri 11.30am-2.30pm, 5.30pm-3am.",

I am not huge fan of Korean food but with most lunch specials costing $10 or less, I was instantly attracted. Despite low prices, there are no compromise on flavor and most of all quantity. You even get a complimentary can of soft drink and bottled water the moment you take your seat. Yet another great about Korean food is their small appetizer like dishes which are totally refillable at Souju Bang. I think most Korean restaurants offer that option but definitely not with a $10 set lunch! Now on to the mains, two must tries would be the hot plate beef and spicy beef soup (beef soup has very little beef which is very disappointing). Take note that I've been focusing mostly on the pricing and good quantity. If you're after better flavor, try ordering from their a la-carte menu which is substantially more expensive but offers greater variety.",

Went to 2D1N (the buffet side) for dinner on a Monday night -- it was busy & bustling with lots of locals (we are expats from CA) with a great, big buffet selection, lots of ice cold water and lime juice, and quick service. The management was very nice. The food was delicious -- my favorites of Korean BBQ are beef bulgogi and japchae, both stellar at this place. I noticed a previous comment regarding no aircon, but when we went there was plenty of aircon! We took our two year old, he had plenty of rice, orange slices, water melon to stay happy! I must add that I am 8.5 months pregnant, hungry, and picky. Also, you can't beat the price of this place!",
