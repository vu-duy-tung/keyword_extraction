    "text": "3.5*Was walking around vivo city and chanced upon this place on yelp and in person. The interior design was what attracted me here as well as the price of the food on the menu. Was seated in pretty quickly and was given a seat where I could see sentosa from afar.For the lunch set there are quite a bit of options. I ordered creamy soup with black peppered beef and spaghetti. I was served pretty quickly too.I gave credit to how the dish was served. Took a sip of the soup and it was pretty good. Wasn't too runny or too thick. But it wasn't as luke warm as I thought it will be.Main dish was served and tried the beef first. The black peppered sauce was pretty good but the beef was tough to eat and I was given a part with more fats. The baby carrot was well cooked but the snow pea was a little uncooked. Or maybe the skin should be peeled off like the refrigerated snow peas.Drink wise I had lemon honey drink. Consumed more ice than the beverage itself. Overall I'll be back for a quick lunch for the ambience and the price. Enjoy :)",

    "text": "My husband likes their cheese baked rice so he wanted to take me here to try some. The host was quite nice when we approached the host stand in the front of the restaurant. We were seated near the large windows which were open to see the Sentosa side of Singapore. I haven't been to Sentosa, so it was a pretty nice view. We took quite a long time to decide on what we wanted, it was mostly me, since I had no idea what I had wanted. My husband ordered the cheese baked rice with pork chops and I had ordered the cheese baked rice with steak. We also get to choose our sauces, soups, and drinks. I got the longan with aloe vera as my drink and my husband ordered the yuan yang drink, which was a coffee with tea kind of drink. The service was great, except they won't talk to you much. They would bring out our orders pretty fast. Drinks came out first, then soup, and finally right after the soup the main entrees. We didn't take to long to finish our meals. It was decent, but I would have prefer a noodle dish instead of the baked rice dish. Cheese and rice, is really not my thing, I just wanted to try it since my husband likes it. The steak was about half a centimeter thick and I was given two pieces. I guess I should not expect too much when it was a combo meal with soup for $13.90 plus the price of our drinks. I may not want to come back, since I did not see too many appealing items on the menu, plus it was a far drive from our place. But I most definitely will want to visit Sentosa!",

    "text": "I also go for their Baked Cheese Rice with Pork Chop with their Borsch Soup. I dunno if their Borsch Soup is authentic but I really don't care, I LOVE it!!! I can drink bowls and bowls of it. It's tangy and full of vege, it's just really really nice!The baked rice itself is also quite good. The rice is essentially fried rice with egg and there is a nice taste on its own. Then they serve it with 2 slices of grilled pork chops and then baked it with a layer of cheese on top. I like the combination of the layers and it's easy on the stomach and wallet too.",

    "text": "Kim Gary doesn't serve refined food, but I like that they are unabashedly B-rate, a bastardised hodgepodge of east and west flavours. So manage your expectations when you dine here. Teenagers on a limited allowance and young adults stretching the remnants of their paychecks at the end of the month will likely appreciate the value-for-money sets.One thing I hated though, was how disorganized and repetitive the 7 different menus here were. Yes, 7 different menus! It drove me crazy.We had:1) Seven Treasure Cheese Baked Curry ($12.50) - laden with pork chop, squid rings, ham, chicken wing, sausage, egg, and potatoes: great for hungry hippos.2) Cheese Baked Rice with Pork Chop ($13.90) - with red or white sauce: Get the red, a watered-down arrabiata-like sauce, over the cloying creamy white one.3) Cheese Baked Rice with Chicken Chop ($13.90):between the chicken and pork versions, the chicken was better done than the pork. More juicy.All the sets comprise a choice of Borsch or Sweet Corn Cream Soup. I say to get the minestrone-like borsch over the sweet corn cream, which was marginally better than a can of campbells",

    "text": "3.5*Baked rice with cheese is definitely good, taste-wise. My beef was kind of tough and chewy though; don't think there was a knife. It's really inconvenient if you're eating with other people, especially since the pieces are not bite sized. It's not very elegant! I found the portions pretty small as well, so I don't think it's very good value for money in that respect. However, drinks were cheap given, 1. it's a restaurant, and 2. vivo is just overpriced even at Food Republic.Best thing is this place is not very crowded, so you can get a seat immediately, and the food arrives quickly! So it's great if you are in a rush as well.",

    "text": "This is the place to be when you have the cravings for Hong Kong cha chaan teng food! From the d\u00e9cor, to the food and drinks menu, to the meal promotions, everything is similar to what you can find in Hong Kong. Possibly, the only difference is the price (logically, it's more expensive here than in Hong Kong).The staffs here are pretty friendly as well. This used to be the only outlet in Singapore before the one that Tampines 1 opened. So the staffs at Tampines 1 receive their training over here. Hence, there are quite a number of staffs floating even during off-peak periods. Personally, I like to drop by here during tea time as it is not very crowded, and they offer pretty value for money high tea promotions. For something light, go for the French toast or the cheese baked chicken wings! Authentic cha chaan teng taste from Hong Kong, YUMS!",

    "text": "This is one of the more affordable Chinese restaurants in Vivocity. Their Chinese mushroom rice is a must-try. Piping-hot hard crusted rice in a pot mixed in with fragrant mushrooms, it's not something you can always find at restaurants. There are set-meals aimed at satisfying your appetites and wallets, most are priced at a range of slightly above $10 - not bad for a set of drinks, main dish and a soup.The ordering system was a little troublesome. It was a DIY method - there were a few forms and you had to go through them, ticking the dishes that you want. I first went to Kim Gary many years back, when Vivocity has just started operations and the queue wasn't that long. They had promotional materials and member cards which had Bosco Wong's face printed on it; that was how I got to know the name of that guy.",

Very crowded, especially on weekends. Which shows how good the food is. Choosing from the menu is a bit difficult. When you get your table, you'll be given a bunch of menus divided into different types of food. And it's quite heavy too. Need to fill up a couple of papers which are a bit troublesome if youre not planning to eat that much. I like it here though because of the delicious food, friendly staff, cozy ambiance (only if you eat during dead hours!).",
