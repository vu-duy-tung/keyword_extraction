    "text": "Tried this place for lunch while at Star Vista. They have various sets and curry dishes. sets come with rice, cabbage, miso and pickles. They first serve us the cabbage salad. \u00a0the sesame sauce is provided on the table. the cabbage was shredded very thin, which was really nice. the pork came shortly after. it was juicy and not dry. i wouldnt give it higher stars just cause it wasnt a dry crisp exterior. the bottom was a little soggy. \u00a0still great..but not amazing. maybe i just didn't luck out...but it was good. would go back n try it another time.",

You have your usual free flow cabbage and sesame dressing. They can get very busy during peak hours (went once for lunch and once for dinner) and so don't expect the staff to be overly attentive.",

(There always seems to be some Japanese people inside, so it must be good, right?)You get free flow of cabbage with goma (sesame) dressing. The tonkotsu, while fried, is not too oily and does not leave me with a greasy unhealthy aftertaste that's so common after eating fried foods.Kids seem to like the Japanese \"scotch egg\".",

    "text": "3.5 Pretty legit Japanese Katsu restaurant in the Star Vista mall! The last couple times the katsu set wasn't as great as our first visit's when it first opened, but it's still decent considering that Singapore lacks much katsu-specializing restaurants. The coating seemed to have gotten thinner and the rice wasn't as firm and moist as it had been- I swear, the katsu we ordered on our visit was so thick and juicy!- but overall it's still worth coming for. I recommend the chicken thigh katsu over the pork ones, it's more tender and juicy, and healthier for you anyway. the pork (despite its $32 pricing for the big size) can be a bit tough at times. will be back!",

And the brown tea (kuromame?) was an amazing discovery. Apologies for my lack of knowledge on the proper names for everything but what a lunch!",

    "text": "What a shame to have missed out this Tonkatsu gem when I was in Tokyo!Imakatsu, a pork cutlet specialty shop which opened its first shop in Roppongi six years ago and Ginza two years ago, has now arrived in Singapore. Since there was a seasonal special menu featuring Fukuoka's Mentaiko, we opted for the Premium Mentaiko Pork Loin Katsu (180g) for $26.80 that is generously garnished with seaweed and spring onions. While some might worry that the savoury cod roe would overwhelm the natural flavours of the meat, I thought it complemented the meat very well, in fact better than garlic pork loin ($19.80) or the cheese variation at other places. In fact, the Mentaiko makes the pork tasty enough to wean you off the excessive Tonkatsu or sesame dressing. If you are not a big eater, there is also a lighter version (120g) that costs $21.80. But the pork cutlet is NOT the only reason why one should visit this restaurant. The Chicken Fillet Cutlet Set ($14.80) turned the tables with its tenderness and leaves no grease in your mouth. Now I finally understand why this Chicken Fillet Cutlet beat the Kagoshima Pork Loin to be the most popular item among the Japanese customers.For seafood lovers, there is the deep fried prawns($23.80). It might seemed costly for 3 pieces but the prawns are truly sweet on its own, a wonderful combination with the homemade tartar sauce that boasted crunchy textures. Another surprise came from Ginger Stir Fry Pork ($11.80), a good alternative for those who are abstaining from deep fried food. The caramelized onions and black pepper lifted the ginger sauce, which makes the juicy pork belly slices a perfect dish to go with Japanese rice. I always stayed away from deep fried vegetables as it defeats the purpose of eating healthy but I guess there is always an exception. This Mixed Deep Fried Vegetables ($11.80) are crisp and light, yet the vegetables still retain its vibrant taste. The Sweet Potatoes and Pumpkin Katsu are so naturally sweet that they could very well qualify as desserts. Alternatively, the cold sliced tomatoes ($3.80) work well as palate cleansers. If the Tonkatsu sauce and sesame dressing is not enough, there is also homemade curry sauce ($3) that is mildly sweet and definitely won't cause any internal combustion.Get your cameras ready when the Piyo Piyo Minced Meat Cutlet ($9.80) is served as the egg yolk waits for no one unlike salted custard bun or molten lava cake. Delicious looking as it may look, the dish is bland and the seasoning comes from shoyu dip, which I wish could have been incorporated into the minced meat in the first place. More than just the usual pork cutlet, I think Imakatsu excels in a variety of deep fried dishes which helps it to cater to a wider audience. One can tell about the standards of the food here as majority of the customers are Japanese. Towards the end of the meal, this bowl of pork cutlet katsu was accidentally served to us while it was supposed to be other customers' order. As I witnessed the tantalizing bowl of juicy pork and scrambled eggs being taken away from my table, I noted secretly to myself that this would be the dish that I'll order next time.",

I have to say this is the same high quality as the reputed tonkatsu places I have visited in Japan. \u00a0All the more reason to go to the Buena Vista area again!",
