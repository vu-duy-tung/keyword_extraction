We sat outdoors and enjoyed the music from the live band. They have live music from Tuesdays to Fridays according to a sign on their window.",

Perhaps they should have some private area specifically for parties as it was quite disruptive to the normal diners. Combined with the live music it was unbearably loud and my table were practically shouting at each other to be heard. Outside was a calmer atmosphere but was quite humid that day so would have been really warm.",

    "text": "Ordered the Wagyu Brisket that plated, had curled into a pathetic ball of gristle and sinew. The fact it came out from the kitchen within minutes of ordering was a huge red flag. The manager had no problem clearing my untouched plate, but didn't say a word until I paid the bill and she highlighted she had discounted a meagre 4 dollars from my 75 dollar bill because of their shitty fake Wagyu. That's what I get for not complaining. Having spent the past 12 years in China, I'm accustomed to restaurants passing off dodgy meat as something more appealing though I wouldn't have expected it here. The management acknowledged the pathetic dish but weren't caring enough to do anything about it. Despite living opposite, I'll steer clear in the future. As Donald a Trump would say..SAD!",

Manager was attentive to your \"eye contact\" and she will approach towards your table to ask if there were any help needed.Food - plenty of choices that you wldnt know which one to order, but overall taste was pleasant. Manager introduced orange and ice cream soda (something like that?) and it was awesome. My mum said it taste like \"vintage\" soda drink which she had seldom come across.Price - I find it was abit overpriced for the food ordered. 2mains, 2sides and 2drinks for 4pax and it was about $110?Atmosphere - we went during day time. So, the sun was kind glaring but it was fine.Overall, if you wish to dine in somewhere quiet and if you've got a car, do consider! :)",

    "text": "Met up with friends and we decided to check out Spruce. I loved how the old Firestation now looks like a swanky makan joint with their ceiling to floor glass walls. Some reviews shared that their service is not that great and in a way, that's kinda true. Ice water was only served when requested but after that, the servers were attentive enough to clear our plates and refill our water often. Between the few of us, we ordered:1) Clam Chowder - good amount of ingredients and the clams were juicy and big. Good!2) Steak Frites - a fairly thick slab of beef that is a pretty good cut too! Seared nicely outside and still juicy and tasty! Absolutely best!3) Spruce Burger - for $18, it's a very good serving size. The meat patty is very tender and accompanied with bacon, relish, onion, lettuce and somehow fragrant bun, total package of Yumz. Hubby loved loved loved this. 4) Salmon Steak - my friend had this and she said its nicely done to get a crispy exterior with a moist interior. Nice she said. The steak frites was costly at $36 but very nice lah. Definitely a place to pull my heart strings for a return trip. :)",

I have been here a few times and the food has certainly not been disappointing.One of their famous dishes is the beef burger, which is delicious. I feel that the burger is a little greasy, but it still is a feast for those who enjoy it.Tuna tartar is delicious as it comes with avocado and crispy bread. It is a good starter for sharing.Dessert is surprisingly great, with their double chocolate cake. You might want to give it a try to satisfy your sweet cravings. Since it is so great, why am I only giving 3 stars? I guess the service is nothing out of spectacular and the price tag that comes with the taste of the food, I guess it is also not spectacular. And it takes you to drive or take a cab to get to such an out of the way restaurant as well.",

    "text": "Spruce, in my opinion, is your average yuppy brunch joint. There's nothing bad about that but there's also nothing special that would make me eat there repeatedly. Whether it's at Tanglin or the Firestation. It was an average to decent dining experience that I'm writing this review about 2 months later.The decor is reminiscent of a NY loft or some of the restaurants at Dempsey. It's set in a relatively quite fire station as you head towards Upper Bukit Timah. It's not difficult to get seats on a weekend or a public holiday so I guess that's a plus if you're going with the 'rents who don't like waiting. We tried the Spruce burger, the benny's and pancakes. I could really sum it up as not bad but not great. So there. Can't really add much because the experience was that non-descript.",

Sitting outside is ok if you don't mind the warmth (there are no fans) and the music (a bit too loud to my liking). The \"breakkies\" are good. The German and English sausages were tasty and the crab cake came with large chunk of crab meat, sunny side up eggs were perfectly cooked. Up to that point my hungry stomach was happy.Then came desert time. Tried the double choc crunch cake: very disappointing! Just another layer cake... quite dry with no distinctive taste. I tried the signature Bloody Mary to quench my thirst and it was pretty good.The main issue was the EXTREMELY poor service. Yes it was a busy day but it looked like the staff needed to get organized and more efficient. That frankly spoiled the overall experience.I will try it again to give it a second chance... Maybe it was all because of Father's Day.Price-wise, \u00a0I would say it's reasonable but not cheap.With a way better service I would certainly give it one more star.",
