    "text": "Lots of hawkerpreneur (new generation hawker) here. Weekday lunch time super crowded but this place most stall only opens on weekday breakfast and lunch time. Recommend this level 2-157 stall named Gyu NamiWagyu beef \u00a0Donburi for $10 only. The bowl is a bill small and hence lesser quantity. However , food is of good quality and quite tasty. The beef is thin and tender, about 60% cook, just nice. Recommend to try it. *Tips: Use Favepay to get 10% rebate for next use. So one person pay with the same favepay account 1 by 1, this way the 2nd person that is the 2nd bowl only pay $9. This way you'll save $1 for the 2nd person / bowl straight away rather than have to wait for next time coming back to be able to use the $1 rebate. Because you might not come back again before it's 3 months expiry. Enjoy Cheers",

    "text": "One of Singapore's best hawker centers! There are a variety of foods to choose from and seating.I had the pleasure of trying some fish noodle soup, cendol, and teh tarik from three different stalls. The fish soup had a nice and flavorful broth and huge chunks of fish meat over bouncy noodles. It was extremely filling for a small size and a small price so I can't imagine myself ordering a large. The cendol was a medium sweet dessert which gave me comfort from the Singaporean heat. I guess I could've done without the teh tarik but why wouldn't I take up the chance to get authentic tea from the Bismi tea stall? The tea was so smooth and delicious I wanted to bring the whole stall home with me.It can be super hot in the blazing sun as there is no air conditioning at the hawker center but I would still come back because this was a great experience.",

Loved watching them stir fry it in the big wok. Beef was tender, noodles were fresh, and gravy was peppery. 5 stars.- Carrot cake: this version seemed to have larger rectangles of the rice cakes, bit more sweetness, and eggs more in big pieces than mixed in. Loved it. 5 stars.- Chicken and rice: I'm not a fan of the traditional boiled version and here got the roasted and cha sui versions. Tender chicken was delicious and rice extra flavorful. Cha sui non pork to be halal was a trip with only difference in taste being thinner slices. 4.5 stars - Tonkatsu: my son loves this dish so we were excited for this find. He ate it all and hub said it was good too. 4 starsLowlights:- Layout: hard to navigate with the upstairs and downstairs. Lots of short rows with tables in between so lots of squeezing around.Love the hawker's fare and would be happy to try more here.",

I looked around and looked at the stalls on both floors. Noodles, fresh juices, hainan chicken rice, they have everything! I wanted to eat everything but the stall I really wanted to eat at was Noodle Story. Walking around you can tell by the lines which stalls are the best ones to go to. Noodle Story was one of them and it was totally worth the wait. There are tons of tables and seats but it's packed during lunch. I noticed people leaving a packet of tissues or a lighter or something to indicate that they've claimed that spot. So simple, but the system works. Hawker centers are great places to find cheap eats in Singapore, which is great because everything else is so expensive!",

My personal favourite is the Han Kee's fish soup stall at level 2, it's probably the best fish soup place in Singapore. If you see long queues at certain stalls, you know they are favourites among the office staff. Go there before or after peak hours. (11.30 to 1.30) to avoid long queues and frustration when finding seats. Place may be quite warm especially if it's crowded, so be prepared to get \"roasted\" especially during a hot day! Enjoy!",

    "text": "Lots of yumminess!!! :) As fellow Yelper Julian C. has recommended, the wonton mee and ipoh hor fun on the second floor (second row of stalls from the entrance further from McCallum St) are delicious! Ah Liang Ipoh Hor fun, #02-122. $3 for 4 fried fish dumplings (never tasted before!) and a few sad pieces of veg (sigh, I always bemoan the lack of veg in hawker centre food), mushroom. The chilli and silky smooth hor fun went together so well with the crunch of the fish dumplings! Not a huge portion of food, but yumm :)Anyway, the wonton mee was pretty good, definitely value for money!! 7 wontons in soup, with 3 fried wontons, and quite a bit of char siew for $3! The noodles I thought were okay, got a bit soggy/chewy (and not really in an al dente kind of way, more like a floury sort of way). Anyway, delicious!! :)Of course, long lines at fish soup/fish porridge stalls on 2nd floor - guess they must be pretty good. Also noted long line at char kway teow stall on 1st floor at McCallum St entrance. Also like the fruit juice stalls!Bf and coworker recommend the hor fun from the cze char stall on the first floor (somewhere in the middle). Called Good Day. Okay, I tried the beef hor fun from Good Day today (4/3/13) and it was phenomenal! Well, I wish there were more veggies but that's a constant wish wrt hawker centre food.. Anyway, delicious black bean beef hor fun! $4 gets you a huge portion of noodles and beef.. I usually get a little hungry somewhere in the afternoon but this was so scrumpilicious that I devoured it all and am still full 5 hrs later. The fish hor fun also looked pretty good, but I'll save that for next time!Apparently black pepper beef hor fun from Pepper bowl is good too! But coworker says service is kind of slow..I bought a muffin from the Bake Of shop in the third row of stalls (I think). $1.10 for an apple crumble muffin! Really cheap and fairly filling. It was somewhat dry though, but good pieces of stewed apple inside. I do prefer more moist muffins, but maybe this was more healthy/less oily.. Haha.More updates since I come here fairly often now - Soon Heng porridge (on the first floor, opposite from Good Day) - has pretty yummy porridge! Also yusheng porridge, which I have yet to try. B Salad Kitchen (#01-37) has gd salads for $5! I love their roasted pumpkin and tempeh and sweet potato, mm :)Noodle Story (featured on Sunday Life recently) has pretty good noodles and lots of ingredients in it!",

I would rate it as the best hawker center in Singapore. \u00a0Of course there are other good hawker centers and we can debate endlessly which serves the best chicken rice or prawn mee or popiah but the reason I love Amoy Street Food Centre is the diversity and sheer range of options it offers. \u00a0I feel truly blessed to be working in its 5 min radius and so spoiled too!For S$5.50 you can get a big bowl of salad (from any of the 4 - 5 salad shops operating there) when the same bowl of greens can easily cost you 15 or more in the fancy cafes around telok ayer and raffles place. \u00a0Or if you want something different you can go for costa rican chicken rice with tacos. \u00a0It was here I tried my first \"lei cha\" - the Hakka \"thunder tea\" which is another healthy choice apart from salad. \u00a0\"Noodle story\" seems to be another recent favorites judging from the line. \u00a0And then of course there are the stars of the show - the famous piao ji and han kee fish soup / fish porridge. Lines are quite formidable every day from 11 am to 2 pm so pick your time wisely if you want to try. \u00a0Fancy some dessert after your meal? There is Koko Icecream - the popular coconut icecream served in a real coconut. \u00a0Or you can venture to the second floor for some baked goodies at Bake-of Muffins at very reasonable price. There are also fruit juices stalls aplenty so take your pick. \u00a0If what you crave is Japanese, Thai or Korea they have it too! It's probably the most international hawker center and the food options itself is a reflection of the changing demographics in Singapore so definitely a great place for people watching as well!",

It's smack in the middle of Tanjong Pagar with lots of office workers nearby flocking over for lunch. Needless to say, you should avoid lunchtimes for your sanity's sake.I won't go too much into detail about the kind of food you can find here, but rest assured that whatever local food you can think off, I'm willing to bet you can find it here. The Thai food here is excellent too, and don't forget to check out the char kway teow. There's also a muffin shop which is pretty good.Unfortunately, it isn't that clean. Used cutlery can pile up really quickly during peak periods, and cleaners seem to be in short supply. Plus, Singaporeans don't have the habit of clearing their own plates, so that makes things worse.Also on the downside, most of the stalls close really early, with some shutting down for the day as soon as the lunch crowd disperses. If you're looking for dinner, you probably won't find it here.",

Love the balance of price and variety of food at this place, definitely better than the other nearby ones like Hong Lim (where you'll be hard pressed to find Malay and Indian food) and Lau Pa Sat (which is more expensive as its so touristy).I would highly recommend two stalls which are next two each other and located on the second floor. The first is a wantan mee stall that sells very yummy wantan mee with uber generous servings of wantans. I got 8 wantans (4 fried, 4 non-fried) for just 3 bucks in addition to my serving of wanton noodles. So, imagine what 4 or 5 bucks can get you.The other stall, right next to it, is the hor fun stall whose most popular dish is the fried fish dumpling hor fun. For 3 bucks you get four pretty sizeable fish dumplings, but the hor fun serving is not too big and you might get hungry in a couple of hours time. Nevertheless, still very much value for money. If you love the fish dumplings so much just go on and order a plate of 6 of them for 3 bucks.Just a note that both stalls are very popular amongst the regulars and expect to see long queues during lunchtime on weekdays. Both are closed on weekends unfortunately.",
