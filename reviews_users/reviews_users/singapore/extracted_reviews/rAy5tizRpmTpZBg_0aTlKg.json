    "text": "Sunday brunch at $138 per person, if you elect not to consume unlimited alcohol, or $168 if you do, provided a fabulous spread, but it's not worth the price. The decor is older, the atmosphere is hotel restaurant and the tables are so close together you find yourself tripping over people both seated and dishing at the serving stations. The food is fresh and cooked pretty much before your very eyes, the various open kitchens provide you with a show of sorts and the children's area is staffed and perfect in allowing parents the ability to enjoy their meal. I started with the raw bar and ate my way through oysters on the half shell and steamed shrimp. I did need a small bath after shelling the shrimp. Sushi was next and, while it was good, it wasn't particularly fresh or imaginative. The \"Western\" beef was rare and delicious while the lamb was cold and filled with fat. The mashed potatoes were excellent along with the green beans. No carrot cake (my absolute favorite) and the pecan tart was okay, but nothing more. I also enjoyed some delicious cheeses. It was a nice experience, but not one I'd sign up for very often. With four more of these \"hotel Sunday brunch\" places in Singapore, I'll need to shop around for a better experience.",

You are sitting next to all of the first growth Bordeaux (Margaux, Latour, Lafite, Mouton Rothschild), lots of second growth, also DRC, Gaja and more - truly creates a special mood for the wine lovers. We had dinner family style - excellent crab cakes, chicken wings, a couple of salads, followed by steak, pan-fried chicken and salmon with French fries, Brussels sprouts and a few other side dishes. Dessert included a number of different sorbet, ice creams and more.Excellent service, both dinner, and wine.I definitely recommend the restaurant, but probably having an expense account would be a significant plus.",

    "text": "Review for soft launch of Beyond Burger:Day 1:How was the plant based Beyond burger? Yes, it was good for the novelty. I love food trucks and love the vibe here, but for $10, seems like they only cooked the patty and bun.... As a meat lover, this was overall ok. I was very surprised by how half the burger felt warm and the other cold. The patty, when eaten alone, didn't have much taste. The sauce, however, went well with the patty. Texture and color was also not close enough to beef. It had ok chewiness but not what I wanted in a beef patty, not dense enough? Color was very very red as well. Also, the veggies were not cooked so the onions were too raw for me. the veggies made the patty cold too quickly. And the cheese was mild in flavor and kept breaking into small pieces. Melted cheese in a burger please!!!! Day 2:Get the classic! The Asian don't need to bother. The sauce was a dry paste so it didn't really cover the patty. Didn't taste wasabi or siracha mayo. The patty still has a funky aftertaste, definitely did not fool me to think it was meat. The slaw had not much taste, should be pickled for more flavor. The burger was much smaller than the classic. Sorry my dear friends who I've misled to try the Asian. For those who try tomorrow, go for the classic! At least the cold veggies problem is solved. Overall the beyond burger patty had good chewiness but was very dry. You need a good vehicle of melted cheese and lots of flavorful sauce to enhance the experience. Personally, it doesn't satisfy my meat craving, nor was it better than veggie patties I get from Trader Joe's or the classic Indonesian seitan. P.S. the burger shrank from day 1. I can eat 1.5 of them or even 2. Went with my friends for dinner round 2 cos it was just not satisfying. And everyone was so desperate for a drink, why? There's not supposed to be any MSG in the patty!!! \u00a0Food truck ends 8pm on 18 Aug. beyond burgers will be going for $25 from Monday at the Mezza9. #futureofprotein #futureoffood #grandhyattsg #mezza9 #plantbasedburger #alternativeprotein #drklingeats #istillprefermeat #mockmeat2.0 #wheredoesyourfoodcomefrom #grandhyattsg #mezza9sg",

The food was delicious and much needed to soak up the preceding wine and cocktails. I was surprised at how expensive the oysters were, but this is Singapore after all. Food was faultless and on cue. The salmon and greens were cooked to perfection. I loved the open-planned kitchen and of course, the Penfolds wine display! I think I tried some wine too, though this was nudging me closer to my threshold for the night. Dessert was gorgeous and I left well and truly filled and sated.",

For a fairly reasonable price, you can indulge in a 3 course meal at lunch with coffee/tea thrown in at the end!The bread they served was pretty good - possibly a ciabatta, with a roasted capsicum/pepper dip. I had the sashimi salad, market roasted fish, and tart of the day. The sashimi salad was alright - it was a little too salty from the amount of soy sauce they dumped on it but was otherwise very generous with the raw fish. The market roasted fish was beautifully cooked but was extremely tiny! Just one slice of fish (I had snapper when I was there) with a couple of vegetables. I originally intended to just have 2 courses but it was so small, I was forced to order dessert. The day I was at Mezza9, their tart of the day was pear. While the ice cream served with it was dismal (strange vanilla flavor, creamy but eh), the tart was actually pretty good. The pastry was nice and crumbly, and it wasn't too sweet overall.I'd go back for their 1 for 1 deal, but otherwise don't really see the point of spending all that money here.",

It was $125/person with tax & service charge, which sounds crazy but it is worth every penny. This includes unlimited Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut champagne, which they top up every time you take a couple sips. You could also have bloody marys, mojitos, red or white wine. I'm usually not a fan of buffets as the food doesn't tend to be the best quality, but this one is different - top-notch food that was constantly refreshed. While vegetarians will have less selection than meat eaters, there is definitely more than ample food for everyone's tastes. The buffets included a raw bar of crab claws, oysters, even caviar. The cheese table was exceptional - high quality cheese with accompaniments like quince or honey fresh from the honeycomb. There was a Japanese section with many types of sushi & sashimi (including vegetarian). There was a Chinese/Malay section with dim sum buns, meat on a stick, and many different seafood stir frys. The roast section had many options including wagyu beef sliders. The roasted vegetable sides were also plentiful. You could have eggs made to order. Plus there was a salad bar. And the dessert table went on for days!We sat for 3 hours enjoying countless glasses of champagne and leisurely working our way through all the stations. It was definitely a treat! (And you wont need to eat for the rest of the day)",

    "text": "I went here for a Sunday brunch and it was quite crowded, many foreigners and many large groups. This is a great place for many types of diners and the restaurant is so large you can easily enjoy a quiet intimate corner for two, a private dining room for a large family, a big round table for a couple of families or any other type of diner.A real drawback, and perhaps it was just for this brunch, but they seem to have squeezed tables into every possible space and even places they shouldn't have, so you were often having to wait to walk through narrow walkways or trying not to bump seated guests while getting around someone getting food. I even saw a table setup at the hostess stand in the front.A big selling point for us was their family friendly atmosphere and they did not disappoint in this area. They have taken one of the above mentioned private dining rooms and turned it into a kids \"camp\" staffed with at least three \"Counselors\" who do a great job interacting with toddlers to teens. This is a free service that allows the adults to relax, talk, enjoy their meals and try many of the different selections. And there are many different types of food to choose from, I've been told that the 9 in their name refers to the nine different kitchens. There is Sushi, Yakitori, general asian, western, seafood, dessert and others I probably missed. Because of their show kitchen concept this isn't a buffet where the food questionably comes out in chafing dishes prepared in the back; this is food being prepared right in front of you and then often being refreshed into the serving dishes as you are taking. The food preparation doesn't get much fresher, especially for a buffet.I think almost everyone should be able to find something to eat, although I didn't see an Indian section or dedicated vegetarian food; and there wasn't a traditional western breakfast items at this brunch, egg station etc...None of us took part in the champagne part of the brunch, but there were bottles popping everywhere and I saw many other drinks, wine, beer and cocktails going by; and they gave us free flow of coffee and soft drinks as well. Often you ask at a buffet for a beer or a soda and you're told it isn't included, it looks like they will serve you any drink you ask for, and your bill will only reflect alcohol or not.Speaking of the bill it is very expensive to dine here, over $135 without alcohol. This wouldn't be a regular weekend activity but for a group with kids this is a great place to get together for a special occasion.",

    "text": "You can be certain that the team at Mezza9 takes their desserts seriously when you discover an exquisite menu devoted wholeheartedly to desserts. Since September last year, this menu featuring five desserts and a cheese platter, has been introduced and adds on to the existing cakes/pastries at the Mezza9 shop. What's better way to indulge in their DESSERT PLATTER ($32++) that offers a taste of everything after a satisfying Italian dinner at Pete's Place! Does this look like a hot piping Souffle? In fact, this is a frozen Grand Marnier Souffle \u00a0that is no less potent than the bottle of liquor itself. Every spoonful oozed plenty of boozy goodness that I constantly reminded myself to handle this with extra care to minimize spillage. Much has been raved about the astoundingly creamy home-made ice cream and this mixed pool is no exception. The smooth, rich Papua New Guinea vanilla bean and Manjaro chocolate ice cream sat in contrast with the eye-poppingly tart Passionfruit sherbet and zesty raspberry sherbet, creating quite an exciting taste experience that would appease gelato and sherbet fans at the same time. There is a bonus that is not as showy as the curvy nut tuile perched at the top--bitter cacao nibs inside the intense chocolate gelato. Mezza 9 Deconstructed Pavlova ($16++ for ala carte) The cloud-like crispy baked meringues were taken down a notch on sweetness with the sourish kick from the sherbet and berries. Dessert flower pots are no longer any novelty but the Flower Pot ($16++ for ala carte) here is probably one of the better ones in town. It is not spammed with mousse or any cheese cake but a superbly executed caramel sea salt ice cream that enrobed the palates with toasty notes of burnt sugar. To be more precise, the caramel flavour was perfect, something that very few can mastered well (most are either overdone or underdone). Besides the flower pot, the Grand Cru Chocolate Mousse ($16++ ala carte) is my another favourite in this platter. After all the bright flavours, this chocolate jar proved to be a pleasantly bitter sanctuary that soothes the taste buds. I emptied the entire shooter of dark chocolate sauce and sank myself in the blissful chocolate bed.  A divine finish for the divine desserts",

    "text": "I completely do not get the previous reviews of this restaurant. Conveniently located in the Hyatt hotel, this restaurant, while elegant in decor, does nothing much to dissuade me from my prejudice against hotel restaurants. I sat at the chef's bar, which certainly has its own unique level of ambiance. However, the service was very inattentive, nothing close to the reception one should receive when paying these kinds of prices for food in Singapore. I'm fully willing to concede that this lack of service was primarily due to me sitting at the chef's bar and being by myself, but that doesn't entice me to ever return. In terms of the food, I had the grilled fish market selection of the day, which was a tuna steak. Nothing to write home about - not bad, but not anywhere close to the best I've had. This is served a la carte style, so I also ordered the Chinese broccoli to accompany. Again, decent but not great. The best part of the meal was the glass of Pinot. Excellent choice there.",

    "text": "Been here on two occasions - but let's start with the food. Normally, the gauge of a good restaurant is how dedicated they are to the number of items on their menu - the fewer, the more concentrated their efforts are to perfecting them - but prepare to spend a good 10 minutes deciding on what you want - they cover all the meats - steak, whole chickens, all kinds of fish, pork, seafood, on the grill, raw, stewed, steamed, fried, blanched, in all forms, shapes, sizes, Asian, Western, or an amalgamation of all the above! Went for the Irish Organic Salmon, fennel, lemon confit 200g ($38) with a side of saut\u00e9ed spinach with garlic (+$9), and MAN did it pack a punch! The salmon was cooked perfectly to my liking - just slightly orange on the outside and rare and succelent on the inside, so it wouldn't flake to the touch of a fork, and the spinach was gut-wrenchingly beautifully done - so tasty, that a gourmet Popeye would have his eyes popping out just at the smell of it.The selection of wines were also very seductive - from all regions, the obscure ones, the famous ones, the celebrity ones (that can go above $500 a bottle!), Argentinian, Chilean, imported from Bordeau... if you're looking to please someone who's extremely fickle at menus (and you're not sure if a certain place will be the right fit), Mezza9 has all the right things (giving you all the right reasons!) to come here. Did I mention that the restaurant is humungous and the furniture and furnishings, perfect? This is too much for me. Too perfect. :-)",

    "text": "Very consistent bar, food, desserts. Basically that sums it up.I've been visiting Mezza9 at the Grand Hyatt for a few years already but just recently I though again what good concept they have and how a good kitchen and quality management can make all the difference.Service is usually pretty good as well and I never had an issue getting a table here.What I like in particular is that you can order all different varieties of food and not just one particular cuisine. Sometimes you just want to mix and mingle your dinner options...Good spot!",

    "text": "I don't usually eat at hotel restaurants while on vacation however Mezza9 became my go-to spot. \u00a0The service is punctual and there were a ton of staff. \u00a0Unfortunately there was a bit of a language barrier at times. \u00a0The restaurant encompasses a huge open space with open kitchens which creates an interesting energetic atmosphere.The menu is mostly a selection of Chinese, Japanese and Thai favorites with a smattering of western items. \u00a0I gravitated toward the Thai menu after hearing one of the chefs is Thai and had probably one of the best beef salads and tom yam kungs I have had anywhere. \u00a0Amazingly fresh and flavorful with unmistakeably high quality ingredients.The only downside to Mezza9 is I left Singapore broke.A safe choice if you are in the mood for spending a relaxing night at the hotel, but obviously not the most exciting restaurant in a great city known for an amazing food scene.",

    "text": "Mezza 9 is the restaurant in the mezzanine of the Hyatt Hotel. It's a beautiful open kitchen concept with chefs cooking right in front of you. There is Japanese, Chinese and Western cuisine, served mostly family style. The service here is very good and the food is great as well. My favorite thing here though, would have to be their dessert. Try the dessert sampler for two (which is really more like for 4?) which is a platter of about six different types of desserts. Make sure to leave room for this! The restaurant also has a small shop that sells truffles, some pastries and cakes and kitchen and home wear. Check out the attached Martini Bar which serves some of the best martinis in Singapore.",
