However, the hawker center was a bit too hot and I couldn't properly enjoy the food with all the heat and sweating...",

The sauce is a nice blend of soya, chili and vinegar.This stall at Hong Lim is run by the nephew of the Michelin-starred Tai Hwa at Crawford Lane. The queue is definitely shorter at this branch.",

    "text": "My favourite bak chor mee in Singapore! (but... I haven't tried the one at Crawford Lane) I've eaten here quite a few times (when the BCM craving strikes, approx once every 3 weeks) and the quality of the food has always been consistent.Nice, springy noodles (go for the mee pok!) with a generous serving of minced pork, pork balls, fried flatfish, dumplings and just the right amount of fried lard. I especially love the fried flatfish, haven't seen it appear in other BCM places. Very salty on its own but goes well with the noodles+vinegar in the dish!However, they don't seem to be open for as long as the other stalls in Hong Lim food center... (have gone at about 7pm only to see that the store was closed :| ) Make sure that you check the opening hours before heading there!",

The quality of the noodle is pretty good... love the springy texture and it is loaded with ingredients (dried fried flatfish, pork balls, liver, minced pork, mushrooms and handmade dumplings). You must love vinegar as they are rather generous with it in their noodles. \u00a0The soup is rich, meaty and flavorful.",

    "text": "I was at Hong Lim Market and Food Centre on a Sunday afternoon with the initial intention to eat the famous Outram Char Kway Teow. Unfortunately, the Char Kway Teow Stall was closed for the day, as was the case for many other stalls there as well. My friends and I could not decide what to eat and made our choice the typical Singaporean way - by heading for the stall with the longest queue at Tai Wah Pork NoodlesThere was a queue of at least 7 people in front of us when we started queueing and the wait was long (and excruciating since we were all rather starved). The uncle cooking the noodles is quite old and hence, speed isn't the shop's forte. I have to say that the noodles were cooked to perfection - great texture and very springy, and that sorts of justifies the wait. They are also rather generous with their lard servings so for those who love those crispy pillows of lard, this stall would make you pretty happy. However, the sauce combination used was a bit bland for my taste and hence isn't a favourite of mine.",
