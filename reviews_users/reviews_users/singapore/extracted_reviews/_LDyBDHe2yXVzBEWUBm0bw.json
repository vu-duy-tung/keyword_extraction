    "text": "Came by on a Friday night with a friend, and they do take reservations online! This place is clearly one of the hipster fusion-tapas places, with decent food. I finished two bottles of house sake by myself. They told us they had some credit card payment issues and everyone had to pay by cash, which made us panic a fair bit, but they resolved it quickly. Given this place is quite pricey, I think they really ought to have a backup plan PRONTO if their machine fails again.We got a bunch of things to share; chicken liver (not bad), hamachi carpaccio (YUM), bone marrow (not bad), brussels sprouts with bacon (not bad), octopus (surprisingly tender), risotto (soso) and my favorite, the duck breast on mash, which oddly tasted of Maccas' curry sauce; delicious nonetheless. Would return, but this is on the pricey side.",

    "text": "I loved this place! Tapas with a Japanese flair--not to mention, the great cocktails! I think everything I've tried has been delicious. The winners, though, are the bone marrow and chicken liver! Not for the unadventurous tastebuds, but trust me, you'll love it! It's butter, but better....The only con I see with this place is that they do NOT accept reservations. And request that all parties must be present before seating. LAAAMMMEEE. Indeed, this is one of the reasons (and probably the main reason) why I tend to frequent Humpback and other restaurants in the area more often than Neon Pigeon. Of course, if you arrive before 7:30, you should be able to get a table..but meh...sometimes you don't want to run the risk! Do give it a try if you're in the region and don't mind waiting for a table",

Top notch bartenders make great cocktails. Loved the atmosphere and decor and music. There were lots of good-looking people, a good mix of expats and locals.",

    "text": "I'm very tempted to give this place one star. Terrible, arrogant staff. Which is a shame because the food was actually quite good - I'll get to the good after the ugly. Singaporean restaurants aren't known for good service staff but this place takes it to a new level. One particular smarmy little eye-rolling git got my blood boiling. 1 - As this place has small and large plates, we asked if he was sure one dish he brought us was the large version, as it was pretty tiny. This was the first *eye roll* \"Trust me\" of the night. 2 - Waitress (different staff) tried to take a plate away when there was clearly food still on it. When we protested she said \"ok ok I was just asking\" 3 - Checked the bill at the end of the night and they charged us for a dish they never brought. When we told The Eye-roller, he basically called us liars by saying \"No I'm sure I brought that, it was the one with \"the sauce\" on it\". Yeah great description genius! Trust me I'd know if I ate Brussell sprouts!! Eye-roller eventually relented and took it off the bill. 4 - Asked them to split the bill onto two cards, two-thirds on one card, one-third on another card. I know this is not convenient, but they refused saying they can only split it 50-50. \u00a0WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?? If you can split it 50-50 you can split it 60:40 can't you?? Instead The Eye-roller stood there making some lame excuse about the system being down blah blah. Ok after all that, we actually enjoyed the *cough* overpriced *cough* food. The highlights were the ribs, the duck breast (surprisingly went well with katsu curry sauce), and the duck bao. Korean chicken was also good. Don't bother with the Bag O' Potatoes. Seriously it's even worse than your aunt's bad potato salad at an Aussie BBQ that no one touches. Not even the flies.",

    "text": "Neon pigeon serves Japanese fusion food in a small plates/ tapas style. Although it was only open for a week when I visited, it was packed! And it looks set to be one of the trendy places that all yuppies will flock to in the months ahead.I liked the drinks. They have an interesting selection of japanese inspired cocktails and some japanese beers that are not commonly sold in Singapore bars. And as for the food, there were some hits and misses. I would recommend the smokey eggplant with lotus chips!Service is great; friendly and efficient. They implement a no service charge system and suggest that you tip according to how you feel. The restaurant/ bar was packed and the noise level was not really conducive for dinner. I guess I am just getting too old! Hence, I would probably come back for the drinks more than the food. It seems ok to be in a noisy bar than a noisy restaurant...",

Bone marrow and ribs were awesome but the other dishes we tried were unspectacular. I would definitely go back for the ambience and friendly service but at the price of each dish ($15-20 for a small plate and for 2 pax 7-8 plates are recommended) and not every dish was that tasty, I'd prefer to go for drinks next time instead.",

    "text": "Went here for an early weeknight dinner on an in-the-know friend's recommendation and thoroughly enjoyed it.Of the eight-odd dishes we tried, the veggies were the real stand-outs: butter braised mushrooms and smoked eggplant with lotus chips. One of the fish dishes was a little underwhelming, but the others more than made up for it. And with a solid selection of beer and sake, various light cocktails, plus a few wine options, there are drinks to suit everyone in the party. Perfectly spaced tables: close enough to feel buzzy, but with enough room that you didn't have to worry about annoying conversation-bleed from the neighbors. Perfect for a date or a sophisticated girls'/boys' night out.Only downside: you'll be paying (gentrified) Keong Saik Road prices, making it more of a special occasion destination than an every Friday sort of joint, at least in my price bracket. That said, it was a more diverse-looking crowd than I would have expected.What really made this place stand out for me was the friendly and attentive, yet zero-pressure service. As service charge isn't automatically included on the bill, make sure to tip the attractive and hard-working waitstaff!",
