This was my favorite dish of the night. The cedar wood fried rice really seemed like cha sui fried rice... The fragrant salt chicken was good flavor but was rather dry... Maybe some chopped peppers and garlic and scallions would have helped. Didn't enjoy the kungbao monkey bread mushroom. The dishes were a but on the small side. Overall a good experience where I for I wasn't eating meat.",

    "text": "Enjoyed my meal here. It's a good place to stop for lunch if you're sightseeing in Chinatown because it's right next to the Buddha Tooth Relic temple, a huge tourist drawcard. I happened to go around Vesak Day so it was super-crowded and they didn't have any seats available inside. Luckily, I was able to get a seat at a tiny, rickety table outside, and even though it was hot and sticky out, I had a nice view of the temple and it was nice people-watching too.They have both a Chinese-style menu and a Western-style menu here. Everything's vegetarian but not everything is vegan. I ordered a curry, but they accidentally brought me the shakshuka. It looked nice but it comes with egg, and as a vegan I can't eat egg, so I had to apologetically tell them I couldn't eat it. They apologised profusely for their mistake and brought out the correct dish in a hurry. They were really nice even on such a busy day for them.Reasonable prices, too.Definitely recommend this place for some Chinese food (or Western food!) in Chinatown, whether you're vegetarian or not.",

    "text": "We enjoyed this meal! My vegetarian fianc\u00e9 said it was the best food he had eaten in a while. First, when you walk in, be sure to find the staircase and go to the 2nd floor (the first floor is a different restaurant). They have air conditioning, and it wasn't set too cold, it was just right. The ladies were pretty nice (we did laugh when our server told my fianc\u00e9 he couldn't have sugar for his hot tea because it's not good for the body...she was totally serious). The menu was very extensive and we loved that they would tell you a name of a dish, then give you a description of how they make it. So, you would know that the inside of some piece of mock meat was tofu or veggies or mashed potatoes, and what it would be coated in (like a crunchy fried coating or a fried tofu skin). It's worth noting that all of the \"meats\" are vegetarian, so you can't accidentally order something with meat or fish. We ate the Peking duck, the BBQ pork ribs, and the sweet and sour pork. My favorite was the BBQ ribs, which were so yummy with some rice. The Peking duck was tasty, but nothing like real duck. They served it with lettuce to put it in and sweet chili sauce. The sweet and sour pork wasn't too sweet, it was nicely flavored. The meat nuggets were perfectly fried and not too firm like some we've tried at other places. We were very happy, and would definitely come back next time we are in Singapore.",

You can even eat some comfort foods \"long lost,\" like satay, mutton curry, or other varieties of faux meat dishes that don't taste \"fake,\" as they sometimes do elsewhere. I highly recommend it for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike! The bottom line is that it's just great food from great people!!",

    "text": "Nice peaceful upstairs restaurant just a block away from the Smith Street hustle and bustle. Seems to be popular with the locals after a temple visit. A pot of loose tea is $5 but really lovely. The chrysanthemum flowers plentyful and fragrant. The menu has many faux meat and seafood dishes as well as a nice selection of vegetables and medicinal soups. All come in different sizes.The single meat dish that I miss since becoming a vegetarian is crispy duck, so chosing the faux version seemed like a no brainer. Not only was it crispy perfection but it was almost impossible to tell from the real thing. The lemon sauce was tangy and not too sweet. I love that their steamed rice is whole grain.There are several desserts to chose from, some of them contain milk, so be mindful if you are vegan. The sweet taro delight was different but I enjoyed it very much. It was a giant sweet potato dumpling in warm \u00a0coconut milk. Not too sweet.Now for the not so great part. The spiced beans I thought were complimentary ended up being $2 when the bill arrived. It's not right to charge for something I did not ask for. At least they should let you know up front. They also charge $0.30 for the moist towel in addition to the 10% service charge.Finally, the service also lacked. Both waiters were standing around without clearing my plates or asking whether wanted anything else. I finally flagged them down after sitting over empty plates for 10-15 minutes. The food is five stars all the way but they need to improve the service.",

    "text": "This is the best vegetarian restaurant I've eaten so far. My family visit them frequently and we always visit Buddha Tooth Relic Temple after that. They are located at Sago Lane you will see it on the right hand side if you approach from South Bridge Rd. The entrance is a door leading to staircase. The dining areas are on the second and third floor. Yes.. you will have to climb up the stairs.The portion is not huge. When we ate there (with my family) we order about 4-5 dishes for the 3 of us. The portion is suitable for sharing so if you have more people you will get a chance to taste a good variety. I really love their olive fried rice... yummy. My son love the hot-plate mushroom. Another dish that I'd recommend is the Seaweed Beancurd soup, it is a clean soup and it's very tasty. The dishes there are not oily so it is suitable for the elderly who don't want to eat oily food. Some of the dishes are their homemade recipes so do ask them about these. The waiters and waitresses are friendly and helpful and they have been there for a while. The owner is a very nice gentlemen and I think his daughter is running the place now.Our bill came up to $50-$60 most of the time for 4-5 dishes. You should give it a try if you are up for vegetarian food.",

    "text": "Our first dish was the baby choy sum. What was interesting about eating this dish to me was that even though they weren't soft, I still really liked them. This was my aunt's and my favorite dish. The veggies were only stir fried, but it had a really good wok taste / flavor. Even though it wasn't soft, which is what I like eating, the vegetable still tasted fresh, good, and healthy (it could do with a little less oil though, I like to have as least as possible amount of oil in my food since I was raised in a household that used more water than oil to cook the vegetables). We got the small portion of the baby choy sum. If I end up coming here again, I would definitely get the medium portion as opposed to the small.There was a vermicelli dish's notation said: served on birthdays, new years, and special occasions. Sounded kinda mysterious to me, and was then instantly sold since I wanted to try some this \"special\" vermicelli noodles! I consider my first Singapore visit / trip to be a special occasion, so what better way than to celebrate this visit with some special longevity noodles?? The noodles were more on the tame side. I wasn't crazy about the baby bok choy since it was rougher than I would like it to be. The noodles were cooked well and tasted good with those flaky things on top. Unfortunately, the menu didn't say what the flaky golden brown things were... So I, myself, can't tell you what they are. o.O If I come again, I would try another noodle dish instead of getting the longevity noodles again. I just wanted to try what the big deal is about this dish. My verdict of these noodles? Really not a big deal. Thus, I'd rather try something else next time.The sweet & sour veg. fish concludes the last dish of this meal. To my surprised, I actually liked this dish quite a bit. I don't like it as much as the baby choy sum because I've just always been a big vegetable fan, eater, and lover. I was surprised that I liked this dish because I usually hate eating \"vegetarian meat or seafood.\" I only got this because I like trying sweet and sour food, haha. This sweet and sour sauce and dish paired nicely with the longevity noodles. So I ate them together, a lot. The baby choy sum paired well with the noodles too, but in my opinion, leafy greens pair well with everything, anything, and even alone. I would get this sweet and sour veg. fish if I visit again.I had a good experience here. We came around 11:30 a.m., shortly after the restaurant opened. Thus, the restaurant was empty when we first got in, and then a few other groups came in a bit later. Still, I get the sense that there aren't many vegetarians in Singapore, that's why I think the restaurant was on the emptier side even though the restaurant is nice and spacious, especially for a restaurant in Chinatown! I do think the small baby choy sum was on the pricier side (it was the best tasting but smallest dish), while the sweet & sour veg. fish and noodles were fairly priced. Our lunch total came out to approximately $45 SGD.",

The service is also attentive but not overbearing (which is an important factor for me). The menu is really quite long, which is good because you have a lot of variety but bad because it's hard to make up your choice! All in all, all the food I tried was nice - nothing was bad, nothing was exceptional, but they were all pretty good. The first and best dish that we tried is the Mock Lemon Chicken. The texture - achieved through the use of soy protein, did approximate that of tender chicken, and it was infused with a delicate lemon flavour, and drizzled with a mayo-like sauce. It came terrifyingly close to the real thing and I wouldn't mind eating this on a regular basis.We also had the Dou Miao with Golden Mushrooms, which was cooked perfectly and the vegetables and mushrooms were nested in a flavourful broth. Next, we also had the Fried Olive Rice, which was quite satisfactory - the olives imparted a nice flavour and the overall taste was awesome.Black Pepper Monkey Head Mushrooms Overall, this is a definitely worth coming back again for the awesome vegetarian treats!",

I think it's quieter on weekday evenings. Vegetarian food can be quite simple/plain-tasting or sometimes flavoured with additives to mask the tastelessness . The food here however tastes really healthy without compromising on the flavour. I usually start of with the Local Spinach soup before going to order a series of dishes to share amongst 3-4 people. They have a crazy amount of options on the menu but my favourites include the Mushroom/Tofu box , crispy fragrant lotus roots, and dou miao with golden mushrooms.I think given the wide variety of dishes , the efficient service and the reasonable price , this is one of the better vegetarian restaurants around. You can expect to spend around $25 / person for a full meal.",
