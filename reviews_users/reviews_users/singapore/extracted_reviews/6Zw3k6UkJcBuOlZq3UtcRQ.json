I would personally go for the Prata which is of course their main business but there are many other dishes like mee goreng, Indian Rojak and more. From savory to sweet, they have it all. I've yet to try their ice cream pratas but it looks promising. My usual order would definitely include the plain Prata or kosong as the locals call it. It's smaller than the usual you get outside but it's a buttery crisp and denser as well. I would say it's a crunchy Prata. The curry is my favorite out of all the pratas that I've tasted in Singapore. It's thicker and savory, not as watered down or acidic like some. Order the papadums to go with it. Simply pick it up from the counter and then the servers will charge you when your meal is done. Free tissue paper is available at the counter too. The standard varies at times but I could usually count on them to provide me with nice pratas. Hop on over to Salted Caramel for some ice cream if you still have space. :)",

The plain prata (made perfect, not overly crispy, yet crispy enough) & chicken curry (this is a side order and comes with a whole chicken thigh piece) are a match made in heaven! Sure, parkings a little toughie and the floor of this place is kinda oily (you can literally slide around like you're ice skating), but what can I say - that's how all the best, most authentic places are!",

I usually get the egg and onion prata and a lime juice. Special mention goes to the lime juice here. It's real calamansi limes, sugar, ice and water. It's not that fake neon stuff common in Singapore now that burns your throat going down, it's the real deal. (Please, don't ever change it guys.)I guess I should also mention this isn't healthy food. But it is real food. A couple times a year won't kill you. It's also a great place to bring out of towners for an authentic Singapore meal away from the CBD. Unless they're snobs they'll probably dig it.",

    "text": "Prata galore! Looking for variety in your prata needs? Yea this is definitely the place! my mind was blown with all the choices, as usually every place is for me in Asia in general. Not gunna lie though, it confused me seeing \"nasi goreng masala\"? It looks like some fusion of indonesian/indian thing going on so i was a bit confused. Anyway, that dish is pretty freakin' spicy, but still good none the less. don't get me wrong, I'm an \"ang mo\" who can take more spicy food than your average \"ang mo\" no doubt, but this was a bit spicier for my liking. The biriyani was really nice! Better than the nasi goreng masala dish.Oh, and how's the prata? Uuhhh, the bomb! i've had the cheese, regular, onion & chicken prata and everything has been fan-freakin-tastic! crispy yet fluffy, chicken curry is excellent for dipping. Now for the vexing qualities of this place. One gripe, the inflated prices! it's increased like 100%! just the year before when I had come to singapore, prices for the nasi dishes and biryani dishes were a little over $3 and now it's gone up to $6+ a dish! Eeesshh wtf?! Also, service doesn't seem to be consistant. The first few times I ate here it was fast and friendly, but the last time (it wasn't even packed mind you), the service was rather rude and slow. Will I go back? No doubt! Will I be happy for dishing out 100% more for my meal?! I'll be sticking to some of the cheaper items to spare my wallet from crying a little.",

    "text": "Supper and roti prata tend to be synonymous in my family and when one of us gets the craving for one or the other, The Roti Prata House at Upper Thomson Road used to be a given. However, I feel that the standard of the prata has been on the decline these past few years, along with the bigger crowd that throngs the stall in the late hours of the night. Perhaps they are finding it difficult to find the balance between quality and quantity but the pratas I have eaten here recently seem to be hinting to me that I need to find a new place for my prata fix. The prata used to be crisp on the outside, yet light and stretchy on the inside. However, recently, the pratas have taken on more of a biscuit like texture. Occasionally, it is so hard that the prata just breaks apart with a poke of my fork. It does not help that the price of the prata here are not cheap either. They have also become more oily.Accessing the place can be a challenge if you do not drive or live around the area. Parking is also another issue, and battling with the supper crowd can be a pretty frustrating affair.",

If you ever had crispy pancake in Phuket or Krabi, that is the exact texture of the crispy prata at Upper Thompson. These pratas are a little heavier compared to your regular ones so start with one order!

We came here after a hike at the nearby Macrtichie Reservoir and we were starved.My group of four ordered one of the thin roti pratas which was basically with a crispy shell, biryani chicken, cheese and mushroom roti prata, and a banana roti prata, and some milos.Overall, I don't tend to like curry foods but this was such an exception. My friend told me the cheese and onion roti prata was quite typical and dipped in their curry sauce, I thought it was pretty delicious. The thin roti prata that we got was strawberry flavored I believe and that was pretty solid as well. Very crispy on the outside and flavorful. Honestly for me, the curry is what made the roti prata for me. Roti prata itself is good, not something I super love.I do, however, really love milo. For those of you who are unfamiliar, milo is a Nestle branded powdered chocolate milk drink but mmm it's so good. A glass of milo to go with your roti prata--prime.tldr; my first time having roti prata so maybe I'm not the best opinion to trust, but I thought it was pretty yummy!",

From sweet to savory, you'll be spoiled for choice and even bewildered by some of the combinations. (cue chicken floss prata)First off, the paper prata is addictive! Super crispy, it goes so well with an extra order of chicken curry! The cheese and egg prata is also indulgent in itself. Lay on the calories and just indulge. The rice and noodle dishes are pretty legit here. Had the maggi goreng chicken masala and the nasi goreng mutton masala and a special shout out needs to go the meats.The fried chicken breast was surprisingly moist despite its fried exterior. The mutton is absolutely tender and a sponge for the spices it had been marinated in. Paired with the spiced fried rice, it was just a delight to eat. Ok it's a dive so the toilets are...well skip them altogether but with a dive comes food at low prices and at The Roti Prata House, the food is pretty yummy to boot.",

    "text": "Late night supper? - look no further! The Roti Prata House is a familiar supper haunt that's easy to get to both day and night (looking for parking space might take a while though). You'll definitely be spoilt for choice with the number of variations of prata that they have here from the usual (think egg, cheese etc.) to some really odd choices for the adventurous.My usual order is always the cheese prata - definitely not deviating because the once that I order cheese egg prata, I was really sad. I love the cheese prata here because even 10 minutes after being served, the cheese is still nice and oozy. The table usually has plain prata and maggi goreng - I would definitely recommend the plain prata if you love the crispy, somewhat greasy type of prata. Curry top-ups are always available to you, which is awesome news for a curry guzzler like me! My only gripe about this place is if you're there when it's really crowded, service can get extremely, extremely slow - which is the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that, this is a great place especially because it's near my place and thus, really convenient for a quick late night supper run.",

Curry sadly seems to have deteriorated and leaves much to be desired.I don't usually bother with anything else on the menu. Everything else I've tried so far (including drinks) is so-so, so why bother when the prata is *this* good. Head next door to one of the ice cream spots to cool down after.",

    "text": "(I feel the need to rant and share this so that other people won't experience the same unhappiness that I did) Guys, DON'T GO TO \"THE ROTI PRATA HOUSE\".The service was SO bad. The waiter spilled curry all over me and he was SO unapologetic about it. My dress, bag and phone were all stained with curry and as I type this, I smell like curry LOL. Initially, I kept calm about it and told him it was okay because deep down I recognised that it was both our faults. He let go too soon when I haven't received the plate properly. It was unfair for him to take the blame alone. But I lost it when he told his supervisor that I FLIPPED the plate. Like what the FUCK??? He pushed ALL the blame onto me. It was a cowardly thing to say and he didn't even apologise for spilling curry ALL OVER ME. When my dad pointed this out, all he said was \"sorry OKAY, everyone makes mistakes.\" Insincere, cowardly, unapologetic and a disgrace to the human race. I understand that he doesn't want to lose his job but giving a sincere apology was the least he could do. He was lucky that we let him off with just some chiding, without asking him to pay a compensation fee. It was enough drama for the day and not worth the extra rise in blood pressure. His supervisor was insincere and obnoxious as well, and was super impatient when taking our orders, telling us to \"HURRY UP\". It wasn't as if there were many customers in the shop because we visited past lunch time. Basically, the service overall was like SHIT and it's really not worth the visit unless you want your mood ruined. There are many other prata shops out there with better service and prata, like causarina or the springleaf prata. Just a warning, so you won't have to suffer the same disgrace and unhappiness that I did.",

I love the texture, crispy yet able to munch on that piece of flour! Brushed it with the free curry served together, it's heavenly! Beware, the curry is quite spicy. Order yourself a cuppa Teh Halia (my favourite!) and you will feel better.Still one of my favourite prata place, cause it's near home! :D",

This shop offers a wide variety of pratas ranging from plain prata, egg prata , bomb prata to tissue prata. The plain prata is very different from the common prata shop you find , it is very crispy and goes well with their fish curry. If you don't the extra calories, do try the prata bomb. The sweet milk prata is definitely going to make the day for sweet tooths. This will be one option to consider for supper along the streets of thompson road.",
