Special shout out to the wagyu cubes that came with the salad. All the food were tasty and hit the right notes of my pallete But The speed at which the food is served is disappointing.. We spent 2 hours there. Not sure was there something wrong or the taste of the food needs to sacrifice time.",

    "text": "CM-PB or Contemporary Melting Pot & Bar lives up to its name as it offers quite a range of dishes, both western and local (fusion) as well as plenty of drinks. \u00a0They even have sushi although I haven't tried it yet. \u00a0What I have had so far has been decent, but nothing has wowed me. \u00a0I've been here 3 times with a group, as it's a fave with my office. \u00a0The thin crust pizza is always a good bet for sharing, as is the burrata and prosciutto salad. \u00a0The burger is also quite good although at $28, it seems a bit pricey and if you add an egg, then it's $32. \u00a0The tomato crab pasta however was not as good as some of the other versions I have had in this town, e.g. latteria mozzarella in Duxton. \u00a0The beer selection could also be better - Kronenbourg on draft and a few predictable choices by the bottle didn't win me over. \u00a0Overall, it's a nice setting, especially outdoors, and it's a good choice for groups, and perhaps some light bites and basic drinks. \u00a0But not really for fine dining or drinks.",

    "text": "I enjoy sitting al fresco on a cool evening, chilling with friends with a cold beer in hand and good live music (songs from the millennium and my era!). The food here is quite decent - the black pepper crab pasta is quite tasty though might be a bit much if you're eating it on its own. The pizza was quite decent - I liked the wagyu beef with sweet onions and mushrooms, and the calamari and chips with truffle mash also quite yummy.Food is a little bit pricier at about $25++ for mains, but I would come back here again. Free parking at Dempsey (whee!) - there's a larger carpark hidden behind if you can't get any lots at the main carpark, plus I love the ambiance of this place.",

    "text": "I came here looking for more bites after a meal and was tempted into their desserts as well as truffle fries calling out my name. I know it is also a popular place for their drinks (love their mojitos!) and was pleasantly surprised to see that they offer breakfast options too. Mark this down for your next Sunday dining spot.The strawberry shortcake is paired with yuzu in its execution, consisting of a scone like cake infused with yuzu and paired with a raspberry-yuzu sorbet. Very interesting combination of flavours and the sweet and fragrant notes of both fruits paired together worked for me. It's sort of like a twist to the popular strawberry-orange flavours.The truffle fries are really good, I liked that their fries were thicker but not too chunky so you have a good amount of crispy and soft potato inside. The truffle oil was really fragrant and the shaved parmesan cheese added a great salty tinge to the flavours and bite. This one is really good!I've head many more of their dishes way back when they first opened and was impressed. Will go back just to try them all again and properly document them!",

    "text": "CM-PB | Contemporary Melting-Pot Bar, I love the name of this place. It is crafty and humorous at the same time. This place is kinda like a caf\u00e9/bar/bistro that mainly attracts people that are looking to relax, chill out and just have a good time. This restaurant embraces the all-in-one concept, being a great place to bring family for breakfast and branch and even experiencing happy hours last until 9pm with your buddies. For the weekend breakfast, children will have free cereal. The truffle fries are another thing to definitely come for, some say there are even the closest contenders to P.S caf\u00e9s.This restaurant must be tried out personally; you won't ever get the full taste just by reading reviews, viewing photos, and hearing opinions about. It is all fusion there, you get some really interesting stuff.",

    "text": "I've been here twice, both times on Friday night and it was packed, so a reservation might be wise. Both times I sat outdoors and it has a casual and lively vibe (if at times it felt like it was teeming with slightly too many people). I love the mussels with Parma Ham Cream and my friends are fans of the mussels with Tom Yum. These are the two things we order whenever we go. At $30 for a big pot, we got one each and were left stuffed. There is a live band that plays music inside, and they're pretty decent, so that's a nice accompaniment to dinner. I'd say that because of the noise level and the crowd, it's the kind of place you head to with friends and not a first date.The only cons about the place is that it is slightly on the pricey side, getting a cab is a bitch if you don't drive and it's a little out of the way.Otherwise, if you're looking for somewhere laid-back on a Friday night, this might be an option.",

    "text": "In 2011, I used to frequent CM-PB at least once a week. It's no longer the default hangout of my friends and I, but it still remains one of our favorite places to go to. They serve good and affordable food and drinks without being pretentious and the staff are warm and friendly. What I love most about CM-PB is that it is comfortable for any occasion. We would bring our laptops (free wifi and power plugs!) and work there all day (it's relatively quiet before dinner). It's also good for any meal. My favorite dishes include the black pepper crab aglio olio, wagyu beef chili and lobster and crab \"tacos\" (note: they are actually dips with nachos). Their waffles and burgers are also popular among my friends. I haven't found any item on the menu that I did not like. It's also great for after dinner drinks. I love their ginger fizz, old fashioned mojitos and lychee mojitos. The bartenders are also very obliging with drink requests. One of my favorite cocktails came out of asking for something with lychee and choya. CM-PB is also a favorite for pre-gaming nights. Umm, our favorite bartender, has given us 10 free shots on more than one of our pre-clubbing stops there. They used to have good live music too (especially when 53A was still playing there). I don't go for the live music anymore but the bands are usually enjoyable. There are huge pluses for being regulars too! CM-PB gave me a massive bag of presents when I was there on my birthday, which included speakers, skin care, a tote bag, and more. Also, CM-PB gives out free soup at around midnight.",

I ordered the fish and chips, the menu says halibut but it's dory which I was told that it changes from season to season. The fish was oily and under cooked so I move on to the wild mushroom soup, one spoon full tells dishwater in a bowl so I send it back and now I sit here broken hearted hungry and everything else that goes with disappointment. At least the beer is cold. New mushroom soup arrived nice very nice thank god for redemption.",

    "text": "Another one of Dempsey's gems, CM-PB is a hip and chic joint that offers decently priced drinks and food for the young and trendy crowd. Surrounded by the lush greenery, CM-PB is a very conducive environment for short getaways from the concrete jungle that is Singapore. The all day breakfast option is decent and much better than the international and local menu and there's a live band performing during happy hours. Depending on your preference, it's much more airy to sit in the al fresco section then to remain cooped up indoors. They also have a complimentary \"Soup of the Night\", which is a fairly nice touch, as we found out about during our last visit there.",
