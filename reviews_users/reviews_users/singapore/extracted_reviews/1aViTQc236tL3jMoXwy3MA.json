Personal favorite is the dim sum basket which is a modern twist on the classic dim sum items (hakao, shumai, etc.). The dim sum are all creative and delicious. Other main-stay items are good as well although not particularly stand-out to be worth the price tag. Very nice ambience though. Good for chilling / meet-ups",

    "text": "This was hands down my favorite meal I ate during my trip to Singapore! There are a lot of good restaurants in Dempsey, but this one is definitely top dog.They serve up delicious \"Asian Fusion\" (Westernized Chinese) food here and absolutely phenomenal drinks. All the dishes were packed full of flavor and the best part was that they all had unique, distinct tastes. Fortunately I came here with a party of 7 and had the opportunity to try several different dishes; I can say with certainty that I enjoyed every single one. In my opinion the only negative is that this spot is quite upscale, so I would definitely only come her every now and then for special occasions, rather than dine here regularly.Favorite dishes:- Szechuan pepper chilli chicken: I expected this dish to be super spicy, but instead was quite surprised to find out it was more of a sweet 'n' spicy and tangy flavor. The chicken was nicely cooked and the sauce was just perfect. Really enjoyed this one. We also order the Tofu version of this dish for the vegetarian at the table and it was just as delicious. - Wok breath rice noodles with snapper: The noodles picked up this amazing smoky flavor from the Wok and the oyster broth was rich and delicious. The snapper was flaky and soaked in all the flavors from the broth. - Five spice lamb ribs: WOW! I have never eaten ribs that were so tender and perfectly cooked. They tasked smoky, sweet and spicy and were fall off the bone good. They do have a slightly numbing feeling though, so if you're not a fan of that sensation then stay away from this one. - Crispy duck steamed buns, White skin siew mai, Scallop crab & scallion dumplings: All three were excellent. Perfectly cooked and full of great flavor. Each were severed with a unique sauce which paired perfectly together. The drinks were also extremely good. I tried the Imperial Caipirinha, the traditional Brazilian drink. But this one had an Asian twist and was served with muddled lychee. The Old Fashioned was excellent, just the right amount of sugar and smokiness from the bourbon. The perfect drinks and flavorful dishes led to an amazing dining experience.",

    "text": "When I first joined the workforce (trust me, not that long ago!), takeout options were typically limited to pizza and Chinese food. So after a long workday, I sometimes find myself craving a takeout and I often end up ordering from Chopsuey Cafe. So this review is for the delivery service, not the actual restaurant - obviously the food comes from the actual restaurant but I can't comment on service or atmosphere.I am addicted to the mudcrab fried rice, I simply love it, to me it tastes exactly like how fried rice should taste like in my book. And it's wild rice, so I can pretend it's semi-healthy! The sweet and sour pork is also pretty tasty and so are most other mains I have tried. The only dish I found a tad disappointing is the prawn toasts, which is unfortunately one of my staples for a Chinese takeout.The fact that it comes in \"authentic\" Chinese takeout containers* is a huge plus for me. Not only are they giving me that familiar feel, I also find it is easier to eat out of when sitting in your sofa haha.I have ordered many times from them and the quality of the food is consistent. Add in the fact that they typically throw in chocolate chip cookies as a freebie and it's easy to understand why they are one of my favorite takeout places even in times when there is a wide variety of options for food delivery.*for those who have no clue what I am talking about, these containers are apparently called Oyster Pail. Google and you'll see what I mean.",

Shoutout to our waiter Angie who recommended the right dishes and portions sizes! We ordered steamed dim sum, crispy duck pow pockets, chilli soft shell crabs, charred chicken rice noodles, beer, juice. Total damages were 140$ as expected. The charred chicken noodles were a clear winner and other dishes were good as well My ONLY complaint was the bun with the chilly crab! Chewy and disappointing. That lost them one star. Was in a good mood so didn't bother pointing it out to the staff. I am happy to revisit and change my review if the chef promises me better buns for the chilly crab",

It's not quite fusion - it's basically \u00a0Western/Americanised Chinese food, not that there's anything wrong with that but one should go with the right expectations.The honey ginger chicken which has a very sweet sauce/glaze, and the signature Chop Suey vegetables, which includes brussels sprouts and broccoli are both delicious. Had desserts on a previous visit and remembered those to be excellent too.Food's pricey, though. So get your wallet prepared for that too...Staff are great, very attentive and service is quick and up to standard.The only miss was a Sweet Pork Belly Bites starter which had a flavourful sweet glaze but the little strips of pork belly were too thin and had been cooked to petrification. Stone. Hard. When it's pork belly, that's enough to make you cry.",

    "text": "By the same people as PS Cafe, Chopsuey offers family-style Chinese food, just a little fancier. I'd say it's a little pricey for Chinese food that you can otherwise get elsewhere for half the price. However, I think it's more the concept you're paying for and sometimes, that's okay. Perfect place to go to with a bunch of girlfriends - think, Tai Tai lunch - (as opposed to having to go to a fancy white-tablecloth-tea-pouring Chinese restaurant) this place has the right amount of trendiness to it, with the same good Chinese food. Now, not quite the place to take your grandma nor the right place if you're a tourist looking for real authentic Chinese food. Like I said, everything here is family style. So it would probably be wise to go with a few people you're comfortable sharing food with. While we were here, we got the Deep Fried Whole Red Emperor Fish, Steamed Paper ShaoShing Chicken, 2 Veggie dishes and the Chili Chocolate Cake. Everything was really good. The Red Emperor Fish was filleted and deep fried to perfection (I normally don't like deep fried fish because of how dry it can get but this was not at all). The Paper ShaoShing Chicken was good too, healthy, if that's what you're into. The veggies weren't too salty or oily. And the Chili Chocolate Cake was heavenly, rich and oh-so-chocolatey. A nice addition to Dempsey Hill!",

The food is quite yummy for what \u00a0it is, which is a sort of Asian fusion by way of those Western Chinese takeaways that every student becomes intimately acquainted with and takes full advantage of but never actually can taste again once they leave campus. This place is reminiscent of that but sexes it up with a strong sense of fun and style. The food is decadent, delicious and made with a well judged amount of spice, tang and yum. Whilst purists may scream bloody murder but Chop Suey is not trying to be \"authentic\" it's trying to class up those dishes we've come to know and love living overseas and who can really argue with such a pretty and well judged attempt at doing so.",

    "text": "As oxymoronic as it sounds, Chopsuey Cafe is as authentically bastardised as it gets. So judge it on its own, as a commingling of American culture and Chinese cuisine, and temper your expectations of Chinese food as you know it.Service was faultless: upbeat, efficient, and sincere. And knowledgeable about the menu enough to make excellent recommendations.We had:1) Crispy Duck Pow Pockets ($17): pillowy-soft steamed white buns jammed with sliced duck confit, pulled roasted duck, julienned vegetables, and drizzled with a tangy-sweet bean sauce: a must-try.2) Szechuan Pepper Chilli Tofu ($18): a vegetarian variant of kungpow chicken, comprised beancurd squares wok-fried with blackened dried chillis, garlic flower, pickled radish & ginger, mushrooms, long beans, and cashews in a peppery szechuan sauce. Skip this, it was middling and forgettable.3) Crispy Crackly Organic Egg with King Prawns ($18): a fuyong omelette of sorts, was laced with holy basil and chilli for a subtle heat, and drizzled with honeyed soy for extra oomph. Lovely, albeit a little oily.4) Honey Ginger Chicken ($24): ginger-marinated chicken wok-crisped and then tossed with honey, ginger root, sesame seeds, and curry leaves; reminiscent of sweet & sour pork. I can see why a Caucasian palate would like this.5) Chopsuey Chopsuey ($16): a medley of seasonal organic baby vegetables sauteed with holy basil. The smoky char was evident, as was the delectable crunch.6) Wok Breath Rice Noodles with Snapper ($26): fish hor fan dotted with silver sprouts and spinach, and drenched in a rich oyster sauce gravy. It's not the memorable hor fan I've ever had, but I liked the smoky char coming through every bite, and appreciated that the sprouts were relieved of their heads and tails properly.7) Vodka Cheng Tng Cocktail ($19): didn't like it. The sticky sweetness of the cheng tng only exacerbated the bitter edge of the vodka, instead of balancing it.",

Very nice actually. The food is fusion chinese. And that's what makes it interesting. The flavors and textures are Chinese but not exactly. The chef mixed herbs and spices to make it different from traditional Chinese fare. Flavors are strong. Nothing subtle about it. The strong flavors and sauces require you to accompany the dishes with rice. The food was good and fresh, however prices was a little on the high side. Service too was good and attentive. Overall I would recommend paying a visit particularly if you what a change of typical Chinese food.",
