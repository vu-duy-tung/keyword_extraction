    "text": "This is one of the \"go to\" places for fish soup for me. Just like other local dishes, there are different requirements to what makes a \"good bowl\" of fish soup in Singapore even to locals. I'm ranking this among the best based on soup taste and richness. It has a very \"home made\" and robust flavour in the soup and I love the \"sour chilli\" that comes along with it that just makes it that much more appetising. The secret is not to just simply use the chilli padi with soya sauce. In fact I don't see a need for soya sauce at all since the soup is already so tasty. Use the sour chilli as a dip and watch a taste full of explosion of sourness with the fish and egg that soaks up all of its rich soup along with the spinach doused in umami flavour. The problem with this old Coffeeshop is its limited seating and it gets warm. Long queues are to be expected during lunch time crowd so avoid that and come earlier for a light brunch instead.Women in Singapore seem to think fish soup isn't as fattening compared to other hawker fare and is a common work lunch favourite among them.ProTip: Bring your gf here on a rainy Saturday morning for brunch and she'll love you for it. Also if you're the slightly more adventurous type, ask them if they have fried fish eggs to add to your already awesome bowl of fish soup. I",

    "text": "Seriously the best bowl of fish noodles out there. A mix of sliced fish and fried fish, in a flavorful soup. The best part is they serve it up with a deep-fried scrambled egg that soak up all the soup broth. \u00a0Tip: they are willing to customize each bowl, thus the long line. I hear orders of \"no milk, less veggies, more egg, only fried fish, only white fish, thick bee hoon, thin bee hoon, fried ee-noodles....\" Ok, if you are right behind an order of 6 different permutations after standing in line for 20 min, you would be tempted to start throwing daggers with your eyes.Yummy.",

    "text": "This is my all-time favourite fish bee hoon soup, ever. Nothing else I've tried compares! It's been here for ages - it's been about 8 years since I first saw it, and it's still as good as it ever was.My favourite is the Fried Fish Chu Mi Fen (thick bee hoon) soup with milk - the soup is absolutely tasty and I always make it a point to finish it. There are options of just sliced fish or a combination of the two, normal bee hoon or ee-mian, or having the soup without milk or the bittergourd version. What makes this special is the fried egg that is mixed into the noodle soup, so delicious, you can order a bowl of it separately as well if you love it.The store auntie who takes the orders has an incredible memory - no matter how many orders and combinations you give her, she always gets your order right, great because the queues can be quite incredible during lunch time - it takes so long because each order is individually cooked and so many people come here. The best times to go would be rather early (11ish) or late (2pm or so) if you want to avoid the queues. The coffeeshop is also quite small and old, so getting seats is another challenge in itself.highly, highly recommended!",

    "text": "This stall is located at a place called Luk Luk Eating House, a very old and 70's type of coffee shop with a few other stalls such as duck rice, claypot rice. It might be a turn off when you first arrive as it is really kind of dirty and the queue is so long during lunch breaks that might make you change your mind. Seats are also a big problem as you will see people standing beside tables trying to 'reserve' them once the people sitting there are done with their meals.When you do finally get a bowl of fish soup, it looks different from the normal fish soup with a slightly off-white colour. There is also a fried egg which this stall adds to the fish soup noodles, that makes the dish special. The egg i tried was a little hard though and i felt that it was not enough for the soup. There is also an option to add the sliced bitter gourd, but since i am not a fan of bitter things i did not go for that.Overall the soup was average not really the best fish soup noodles i have tried here, but still acceptable. Service was average as well, but i think i will not go there specially for this dish again due to the long queue factor.",

    "text": "Thick fried fish slices + tasty soup + deep fried egg (are you seeing a theme here) + oodles of garlicky chili sauce = winI tried having this with the yuan yang, or sliced fish + fried fish, but their fried fish is far more delicious, so that's how I like it. The soup is made even tastier when I drizzle their chili sauce in it. Hot soup with garlic and chili makes for a cure for the flu, no? The office workers in the neighbourhood all have the same idea too, so either go early or late--this is not so much to avoid the queue as to avoid a too-long queue. Uncle moves really quickly, and in a pinch the coffee shop has emergency tables they can open, but hey, we can be flexible with our lunch times for good food, no?",

The soup was tasty, adding the fried egg was definitely the way to go, but the bee hoon was pretty tasteless for me - I'll skip the bee hoon next time and just ordered the fish soup with extra fried egg and extra fried fish. The location is pretty convenient for me since it's pretty close to all the attractions, but I like the Holland Village XO Fish Head Bee Hoon's soup better.",

The soup with the milk, the tasty fried fish, served with a good portion of spinach is really awesome for an afternoon meal. The lunch time queues are long but well worth the wait!The great surprise of this dish is the scrambled egg that has been deep fried, it soaks in all the broth. Usually I ask for extra eggs as a side dish.Have it with rice, ee-mian, the thick or thin bee hoon, it's all good. A must-have if you're in the area.",
