    "text": "If you visit Singapore, but don't go to food court, then you short-changed your trip and didn't get a full experience. I 110% implore you to look into going to a food court when in SG. It's as down-to-earth and local as it gets- well, some food courts are more local and some are more touristy, but you get the point. Bukit Timah is my favorite food court in Singapore. It's very old school. There's a small wet market downstairs, and \u00a0the second level is where the food court is. The Singapore Laksa from Terry Katong is excellent. I found the broth to be very robust with chili flavor. Still not as delicious as Malaysia laksa (haha), but still absolutely delicious in its own right. Also, the carrot cake from Seng Kee Carrot Cake is a nice sharable side. Also, get the Hailam Chicken Rice. I got mine from Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice.",

The Beauty World MRT station is right outside too, and has a covered walkway all the way to the doorstep. A must if you love Singaporean food!",

    "text": "Sin Chew Satay Bee Hoon \u00a0Stall #162They are known as the worthy replacements of the now retired Ming Kee folks at East Coast (Ming Kee was crowned Street Food Master in 2007). Their sauce is perfectly balanced, it is sweet, spicy, savoury, nutty and yet smooth. \u00a0The cured cuttlefish is softly chewy. The lean pork, prawns and cockles all comes fresh, just slightly pink. The bee line here day and night is a proof for their diligence and craft. They sold out at 9pm when we were there on a sunday night!Check out the satay sauce covered bee hoon. I know for sure, that the next time I order this, I will have to top up for more stay bee hoon sauce! The bee hoon portion is enough for 1 hungry person or also enough to shared amongst 2. It comes with 2 prawns and sizeable pork slices.Sin Chew Satay Bee Hoon ($5.50) and Kang Kong cuttlefish ($3.50) is always one of the rave about stalls that make it to the must try list when visit the food centre.The sauce with the kang kong and cuttlefish is sweet, similar to that of the sweet red sauce that you eat with yong tau foo. The cuttlefish was delightfully chewy with lots of bean sprouts to crunch on with every bite.Overall, Sin Chew satay bee hoon has its uniqueness in the taste, those prefer the creamier gravy and less pungent in the peanut flavor may please with the dish.Xie Kee Hokkien Mee \u8b1d\u8a18\u798f\u5efa\u9762 Stall #174Probably one of my favourite Hokkien Prawn Noodles around. The noodles are so wet, even after waiting for 10 minutes, the noodles aren't dry! The noodles are cut so small that you can polish up this plate with just a spoon. For $3, you get 2 prawns and sufficient noodles for 1 pax, but if you're hungry go for the bigger servings. The noodles itself was soft and very flavourful.The sauce is very addictive and I was so tempted to get more. They are very generous with the sotong (squid) and the squid was delightfully chewy and together with the prawn mee sauce, it was very enjoyable.All in all, if you're in the Bukit Timah Food centre, do not leave without trying a plate of this!",

Fried Carrot cake is frequent with long queue. many stalls here selling this cuisine, you need to go to the correct one located at the corner stall on the third row facing the road, you will never forget the egg taste that blended well with white carrots cake. just another row in front is the famous Penang fried kway teow, the chef was previously a high rated chef in hotel line. so see what you can taste at a lower price as in hotel restaurant. Need to mentioned the long queue Satay Bee Hoon & cutter fish Kang Kong. both are not to be missed. Fried Oyster Omelet is still in the original Singapore taste is hard to find now, you can get it here at the last second row. Chinesr Satay are famous here, fish soup, goa hiong, rojak, fried kway teow etc are all in original Singapore taste here. you will never regret to dine here. A place not to be missed.",

    "text": "Xie Kee Hokkien Mee (#02-174): You know the food is good when they tell you \"no customization\", even when you're willing to pay for it!! Haha. I'm talking about the Hokkien char (or as Singaporeans call it, Hokkien Mee). There are two stalls but I always go to that particular one which the apprentice is a boy of late teens or early 20s. If you're unlucky you'd have to wait for 30minutes just to buy a $3, $4, $5 or $6 worth of noodles. Is it worth it? Please look at my rating for the stall - this was in spite of the semi-smug reply about no extra egg, and long wait in the muggy Singaporean weather. I live close by so I like to takeout (or \"tabao\") my food to eat in the comfort of my a/c-ed home. Yes, it may be a little soggy but I kinda like it a little soggy, that's when you get the prawn/shrimp stock beautifully infused into the noodles. The sambal paste is pretty good too. All in all, it's darn good, despite not entertaining my extra egg request (they batch cook). Yum yumSoon Kee Coffee & Tea (#02-200): There's nothing really special about it, pretty standard offering, except they have a nespresso machine. Price is decent $2.50-$3. Thunder Tea rice - I'll update this another time.",

Been a customer of theirs since 1999 when I moved to Singapore for school.Second reason, food of course. I recommend getting the Pad Thai noodle (Tasty Thai Hut) and the boneless duck rice set here. Great price for great taste. Fried carrot cake and Chee Chong Fun (plain) is good too. I realized that they sell Terry Laksa here too when I walked around the food center one day. There is also a bread store which I highly recommend (opposite the boneless duck store) for its fresh baked goods and price. Better than branded bread store I shall say.Third reason is because of the tailor store and another store that my family bought prepaid cellphone cards from (Rarely visit these stores).This market had also been remodeled to give a better outlook which attracted more customers like myself and others. Will continue supporting the businesses till we leave the Bukit Timah Area :)",

Wasn't sure what the final noodle dish was but was mostly eaten by my friend - fine by me given that I didn't like it!Nice banana shakes and good lime juice. My favourite dish was definitely the chicken rice though. The layout is awkward; seating is cramped and far less room than maxwell, for instance. Prices are fine though, and the dishes come in healthy servings. Bring a couple friends, \"chope\" a table, and send everyone out to grab a dish!",

While the wet market below is abuzz in the morning, the food centre above is pretty crowded throughout the day on weekends. I love the place for its variety and the fact that there are many hawker stalls that serve quality food. My favourite foods from Bukit Timah Food Centre include the ngoh hiang and fried bee hoon from zhong zhong fine spice and the pasta from Pizzaria Creation. The mutton soup stall in the same row of stalls as zhong zhong fine spice is pretty awesome too, but I can't remember its name off hand unfortunately. My only qualm is that the walkways between the stalls and the tables are very narrow and on the Sunday evening when I was there, trying to get from one row of stalls to another proved extremely difficult, especially when there is a queue at one of the stalls. The human traffic jams can be pretty frustrating and unpleasant when it gets really crowded.",
