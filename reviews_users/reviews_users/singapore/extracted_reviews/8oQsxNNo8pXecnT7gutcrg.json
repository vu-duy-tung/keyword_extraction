Food was overall quite good but not spectacular. Favorite dishes were the chicken, Lo Hei, and the fish. Quality of ingredients and excellent and the food was well-cooked but don't' think it was worth the $200/pax given the lack of wow factor. Set was quite big and we were all stuffed by the end of the meal",

    "text": "Despite the uneven reviews, we went for brunch...and are so glad we did!The building and the entire Cjimes complex are visually appealing and harken back to times long past. The room is well spaced, with a comfortable feeling (see pic).The food was absolutely delicious.We had a half Peking duck which yielded ten little pancakes in which slivers of the skin and meat were nestled. As with most purveyors, the remaining meat was then taken back to the kitchen to turn into a polished fried rice dish (we could have opted for noodles).We also enjoyed:- Roasted crispy pork. These crispy little cubes were absolute heaven! I ordered the same thing later that day at another well known restaurant...no where near as good as these were. I could easily opt for a big plate of these for my last supper- Fried silver fish. If it weren't for their tiny black eyes, you would assume a plate of Mickey D's fries!- Flaky pastry with shredded turnip in a crazily shaped dough- Steamed Shanghainese dumplings (nearly impossible to coral onto the serving spoon or grab with the sticks...you might ask for a fork, particularly if you're in a hurry)- Panfried stuffed red chili, green chili and eggplant ...There was NOT a miss in the bunch!While I feel we were well served, I can appreciate some of the service related comments offered by other yelpers. While hard working, staff could be a bit \"smoother around the edges,\" and interactions were sometimes abrupt. They were constantly ensuring our tea cups were full...if I were a bit more jet lagged I might had minded the frequency. Language was uneven across the staff, such using the wrong word or our needing to repeat..but, again, we really didn't mind.To the contrary one of our many servers was very polished and extremely customer focused, having done a great job. Among a myriad of duties (including rolling a table through the dining room), he was on point for the Peking duck experience!I can only speak to the midday dim sum experience, but we feel this was a home run and a memorable experience...a definite recommend.",

    "text": "This place is exquisite! I can definitely understand why it is a Michelin-starred restaurant. It is within walking distance from city hall/raffles city areas. It is located in a little \"restaurant village\" called the chijmes. The outside area is a beautiful garden theme. You will walk in to an elegant building where they will escort you to your table either downstairs or upstairs. There are very many exotic yet edible sea creatures in tanks stacked in three rows towards the end of the downstairs dining room. The servers are a little familiar with the English language; however, most items in the menu are pictured as well so ordering isn't too bad of a task. Food was wonderful- each dish was refreshingly tasty. They also have an in-house restroom, which is also a perk. I would definitely try this restaurant again!",

It also tastes quite like what you imagine that to taste like, too - salty, yet indistinct, and generally you don't know if you want it in your mouth. And yet, two of us had a second helping out of curiosity and (mostly) disbelief. We agree that we actually almost like it.\" Think you know what I'm referring to?Find out at:junkasia.com/2018/06/06/\u2026",

A large dining area which means you can actually get a seat here (as opposed to most 10-15 seater places with stars which are booked out months ahead). Loved the braised pork in chinese wine, and the braised vegetables which included some unknown to me veggies but with excellent texture. Also got the crab dumplings which were ok.The bad:The service wasn't up to the standards I was expecting from a Michelin star place. Very unattentive, not refilling your water, taking forever to give the drinks, also they were not able to explain a lot of the dishes very well.",

Peking duck was crisp with great flavor, pork, tofu, soup... all was excellent. I didn't see the menu and the server spoke mostly in Chinese so I didn't quite get the name of food.Service was excellent, she was attentive, served next food just when we were finishing one, kept coming back to pour more wine, changed a plate for each dish served.I likes they prepared two chopsticks, black one is to pick food from shared plate and white one to eat from your plate. It was a pleasant evening with great food. Highly recommend for business dinner.",

Far from the best, but sitting comfortably above the mediocre line. Everything arrived promptly, which is always key for two reasons: dim sum ought to be served pipping hot, and more importantly to maximize variety at any given moment.The space was nice enough, a bit tired, but comfortable and pleasant with a nice weekend crowd. The kind of place you could invite fellow yummy mummies or future in-laws to.Service - everyone was friendly and adequate though they didn't give me much else to say about that. Verdict: I've added Lei Gardens to our Return list, which isn't bad considering there are only about 3-4 other places on the list.",
