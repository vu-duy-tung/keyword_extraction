    "text": "I heard a lot of good stuff about this place from my friend, especially the Malaysian food. Hmm, I want to say 3.5 stars for service and 4.2 stars for food. There was a queue for my party of 1. At times I felt overlooked as well, even after being sat at the table and ringing the bell for service. They were busy on a Wednesday night, maybe short staffed? It's a good thing they have an efficient ordering system. You mark the item number on the ordering pad and press the bell when you're ready. I ordered the nasi lemak with beef rendang. It was delicious. The rice had a coconut flavor and complemented the curry very well. It was pretty good combo for the price too. I also ordered the cendol. It was also really good, great for the dessert too. I almost ordered a second. It's best to make a reservation at this place! Also use the restroom and wash your hands before because the restrooms are in the mall outside. Will come back for sure.",

Came with a good number of prawns of a good size, bean sprouts, egg and koo chai (chives).So was the crayfish crispy kway teow with chives and green leafy vegetable. This is in gravy.Everything was served piping hot.Heard their nasi lemak is good too.Prices are reasonable. Not noisy.Reasonably good ambience. Nicer than the one at Suntec City. Char kway teow here is also better than Suntec City.",

The \"The Tarik\" milk tea was perfect.Efficient ordering system too (make selection on paper, then press a button for attendant).",

Sorry, I was half expecting it to be bad since you really cant replicate hawker/ street food in a restaurant. Well, apparently they managed to do it pretty decently. I wouldnt say that the food is wow. It definitely isnt up to your best street food experience. But hey, it is decent enough for me to want to order it again.I had the hor fun with white chicken. It was pretty good (but I dont like breast meat boo). The chendol with soy milk and red bean drink was very yummy. We were served an appetizer of coffee bun which was delicious since it was freshly baked. Thumbs up!",

So yes, my colleagues brought me here for lunch at Plaza Singapura to get a first taste.I have to say I was very impressed with the service. They even have a button (like a doorbell) placed on each table if you require assistance. Famished, I ordered a rice meal. And my oh my, the serving could have lasted me the whole day. They had a big bowl-sized scoop of rice, a runny fried egg (just the way I liked it), a crispy fried chicken leg, and sambal'ed ikan bilis. Taste-wise... I can say that I have definitely tasted better. But still, I think I will give them a thumbs-up for everything. My two other colleagues ordered something noodle-y. Can't really recall what they had. Probably laksa and some vegetarian noodles. They too had enjoy their respective meals and had no complaints.One of my colleagues ordered their scrumptious coffee buns that I admit to have regretted not getting some for myself. Thing is, I can never think of my future hungery self when I am feeling fully bloated with food. Ah! Maybe next time.",

    "text": "Having been known for its rich, affordable papa-style Malaysian dishes, Papparich now introduces their all-new Papparich Plus at Plaza Singapura and OneKM Tanjong Katong.The Kampung Fried Rice $10.90 may have humble origins but is no way short of flavours. Shreds of kangkong, julienned chicken breast, squid with a sloppy fried egg plopped and crunchy ikan bilis, the grains might not look refined but won our hearts with the arresting wok-hei aroma and well-seasoned taste. The Sweet & Sour Crab Meat with Fried Rice $11.90 is Papparich's founder, Rich Tan's interpretation of the Singapore Chilli Crab. An experimental work that missed the mark for the sauce was too sweet and lacked depth. For those who used to the tangy Assam Fish Head, the Red Snapper Curry Fish Head $34.90 may lack the punch. But this Indian-Middle Eastern inspired fish pot is no less intriguing and mesmerizing. The clever use of 22 spices such as kunyit, buah keras (candlenut) and biji halba (fenugreek seed), bolstered the coconut milk-based curry broth, giving it a full-bodied, robustness. Not keen on the fish head? there is also the fish fillet version. It's sort of a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu encounter with the Ayam Masak Merah $12.90, which uses similar ingredients and cooking techniques like the Chinese Stir fry pork Gu Lu Rou (\u5495\u565c\u8089) . The adoption of chicken thigh instead of pork levelled the tenderness but the flavours of the sauce could be teased out further.The two unstoppable dishes were the Sambal Aubergine $9.90 and the Four Heavenly Kings in Sambal Belacan $11.90. Deep-fried till beautifully blistered on the skins, tossed and coated in Sambal hot chilli, the Sambal eggplant is a truly venerable rendition and the BEST I've encountered so far. The Four Heavenly Kings, represented by ladyfingers, long beans, eggplants and petai, faced off one another in a spicy formidable battle intensified with the deadly yet assertive belachan paste.",

    "text": "Saw this name when cruising to Malaysia about a month ago and keep seeing or hearing the name in Singapore so decided to try out on a Saturday for lunch. Arrived at Plaza Singapura around 1pm and managed to park the car within minutes.Reached the store close to 1pm and surprisingly the store was not crowded. In fact it was half full. Get seated pretty quickly and upon seating, my family and I were given menus to look at.As a newbie at this chain, I was not aware that there are electronic bells attached to the set of cutleries. I was also not aware that there were notepad (a list of menu) with pencil on the middle of the table. So, yes, if you are a newb like I do, please take note of that - bell to call upon the servers and notepad to order the food and drinks (just like in a Chinese dim sum restaurant).Upon browsing the menu, the dish that caught my eyes is R-04 (Super Rich set) and Mango Mania for the drink.The dish came out much quicker than expected (within 10 minutes). Super Rich set consist of Nasi Rich (Nasi Briyani), fried chicken, braised beef also known as rendang, sweet & spicy squid, a piece of potato, half of hard boiled egg, lady finger, papadum (crackers) and chili (sambal). I like all the small dishes besides the lady finger (don't really like the sticky texture inside it). The portion was rather big. Was expecting a smaller portion but managed to consume it all. I have to give credits to the squid as it was well cooked and it has a chewy texture that I love. Overall, it was a great combination.For the drink, Mango Mania is blended mango slush with longans, watermelons and nata de coco (coconut jelly). The overall taste is perfect for my liking.Will definitely come back to this place for food as well as the ambience. Selamat makan (Enjoy your food - Bon Appetit)!",

    "text": "Serving greasy Malaysian street food at hearty portions and reasonable prices, it's little wonder the chain restaurant is frequently packed.Unsurprisingly, service was awful; we never got served any water, getting a server's attention was an impossible task, and just about every wait staff sported a glum grimace. I'd asked to hold off the parsley/spring onions/coriander, and they took off ALL of the vegetables...my noodles missed their beansprouts and kangkong.Notwithstanding the woefully lackadaisical service, the Malaysian fare at PappaRich was pretty commendable. We'd been craving the Hokkien mee back in Penang, and PappaRich's rendition did well in scratching that itch.We had:1) Chicken Satay (8.90 for 6): so succulent and flavourful, it rendered the accompanying peanut sauce redundant.2) Pappa Prawn Mee ($9.90): a lovely blend of rich shrimp stock and chilli spice, generously studded with fresh prawns and poached chicken slices. The robust broth was wonderfully comforting on a cool rainy night.3) Pappa Fried Mee ($8.90): imbued with the smoky accent of the wok, was equal parts sweet and spicy and savoury. It wasn't the most outstanding, but it passed muster.4) Pappa Chicken Chop with Curry Sauce ($12.90): beautifully crisp skin. I liked the creamy curry gravy, but thought the fried rice rather pedestrian and fried egg slightly overcooked",

The fruit with rojack sauce was slightly less successful, an off combination of radish, tomato, cucumber, pineapple and apple mixed in a sweet hoi sin-y peanut-y sauce. Perhaps just tourist noobs, but it was a little too heavy for our liking.",
