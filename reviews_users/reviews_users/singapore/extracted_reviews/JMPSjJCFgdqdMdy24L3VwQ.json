We washed it down with the mango lassi and the salt lassi (not quite sure what it is).Food here was served quickly, with clean cutlery, air-conditioning, and a generally spartan but clean environment. The food was delicious, and on the spicy side. If you don't take spicy food, this place is probably not for you. We saw a few Indian families having their dinner here, and we grossly over-ordered. The drinks were not too bad - I enjoyed my mango lassi because it was thick and they weren't stingy with the mango, but my companion said his lassi wasn't very authentic. We also got a thosai and it was freshly made, with lots of chutneys to eat it with. It could have been crispier, but I guess they do naans and dishes better at this place. Great place to share food with a group.The whole thing cost about $70.",

A tad disappointing when we had to scrapped for meat while the gravy was spicy and delicious. Nice clean and recently renovated place. All in all, price a bit on high side.

Anjappar is my favorite Indian restaurant. When I say Indian, I mean Indian--none of that funny Malay food cooked by an Indian. The Indian food I'm used to in the States is North Indian, and all the South Indian, I've tried, I didn't like. Until that is, Anjappar. Granted, the palak paneer isn't the best I've tried but the butter chicken, chicken tikka, and mutton biryani are to die for! Their naan are also great--not too thick and not too thin. Try their daal as well! I've brought Indian food haters to this place, and I swear, I gave them some butter chicken, naan, and a bit of biryani, and they never looked backed! The butter chicken here is really THAT good. If you're looking for Indian food in Little India, this is def. the spot! Forget what you hear about Banana Leaf and come here instead!",

They even managed to serve me beer in a warm dirty glass. It pains to see the name of my beloved chettinad cuisine being tarnished by these imbeciles. I would recommend everyone to stay hungry than eat here.",

The best part was a variety of curries/sauces/veggies that came with a bowl of rice. But even better was taking the delicious garlic naan and dipping it in everything. Maybe all Indian cuisine is this good over here in Singapore. But from where I am from this was outstanding. Chicken, variety platter, beer, rice, garlic naan cost $36.

The staff was not extremely friendly and, at times, they were inattentive. \u00a0Also, our naan was forgotten. \u00a0We had to remind them. \u00a0By the time the naan was brought out, we had almost completed our meal.I enjoyed the ambiance. \u00a0It is a large open space. \u00a0While not lavish, it is definitely a step up from many of the places in Little India. \u00a0There are certainly some touches denoting this is an Indian restaurant.The food was all very good. \u00a0I did think the entr\u00e9e dishes were small. \u00a0 There really wasn't quite enough of each for two people to properly share. \u00a0I thought the presentation was lacking. \u00a0I didn't expect anything fancy. \u00a0But the bowls were not neatly filled. \u00a0It just looked like the food had been ladled out without any care.Mushroom 65 \u00a0- This appetizer was quite nice. \u00a0The earthy flavours of the mushrooms combined nicely with the mix of spices.tinyurl.com/khm95puOnion Pakkoda - This cousin to onion bhaji was delicious. \u00a0I could eat a boat-load of it. \u00a0It was crisp and full of flavour.tinyurl.com/nyehz6hButter Chicken - Tender chicken in a wonderful mild sauce. \u00a0This was a very good rendition of butter chicken. \u00a0tinyurl.com/kqty839Aloo Gobi Masala -This is an Indian dish that I have really only recently began to appreciate. \u00a0I enjoyed their version. \u00a0The vegetables still had their shape and texture. \u00a0The flavour profile was mild without being bland.tinyurl.com/la7rh59Prawn Masala - This was my least favourite dish. \u00a0Don't get me wrong. \u00a0It wasn't bad. I enjoyed it. \u00a0The prawns were just slightly overcooked and there were very few of them.tinyurl.com/leaxa54Garlic Naan - While it arrived late, this was very good naan. \u00a0It was freshly prepared and there was loads of fresh garlic. \u00a0The texture of the naan was perfect.tinyurl.com/knqxqs5Receipt (Dinner for 2) $56.85tinyurl.com/kgqyxhgOverall,- I would say that Anjappar Authentic Chenttinaad Restaurant is about very good Indian food served in a nice space. \u00a0The service may not be perfect but would not deter me from returning. \u00a0If there weren't so many other Indian restaurants to explore, I would certainly be a regular.",

I was also particularly impressed by how fast the service staff entered our orders into their PDAs, which presumably then gets sent directly to the kitchen and they never got anything wrong.I could probably gorge myself silly on the masala butter chicken and garlic naan alone but the good sense in me told me to try other stuff on the menu as well. Mango lassi was creamy and just the right balance of sweetness and acidity.The fish curry was \"tua kong\" (really really good), extremely spicy for my moderately tolerant palette but so worth it. Briyani is also good here and the atmosphere is vibrant and lively, exactly how I like to have my Indian food.Parking is of course a nightmare but circle the block a few times and you're bound to get lucky.",
