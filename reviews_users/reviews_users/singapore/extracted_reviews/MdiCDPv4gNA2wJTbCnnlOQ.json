    "text": "This is a pretty good place to get a quick taco. While it's not gourmet or anything, the tacos are pretty satisfying and actually quite authentic. They use corn tortillas and not flour tortillas like many Mexican places in Singapore. They don't load the taco with mozarella cheese so it really isn't the jelat tex mex fare you get most often.I also kind of like the bar concept they have going on. You can watch your sever preparing your taco and it's fuss free and quick. Senor Taco is kind of a strange mix of tacky - Orchard Towers and LCD TVs blasting pop music - and pretty damn satisyfing tacos. Perhaps they could improve on variety but I really won't complain because they offer pretty authentic Mexican tacos in Singapore, where finding Mexican that isn't tex mex is like looking for a needle in a haystack.",

The tortillas are delicious and the sauces are fresh with options from medium to super spicy. Our server was friendly and provided great service. The only main drawbacks are the area- being located in Clarke Quay you have to deal with higher than usual prices and the occasional table of obnoxious people. Speaking of tables, ours was really sticky but we were so happy to have found tacos that were close to the level we were used to back home we looked past it. We will continue our search for good quality Mexican food at reasonable prices but will be happy to return there again.",

    "text": "Se\u00f1or Taco is an alfresco taqueria located in Clarke Quay. Seating is bar-like, with people perched on high-standing stools along similarly elevated tables. Upon our arrival, one of the chefs came out to take our order, and he told us about the place, including the fact that this is the first taqueria in Asia. I tend to take all such claims with a healthy pinch of salt, but I'll accept that all other Mexican outlets I have come across do tend to sell more than just tacos! Tacos were quite cheap at between $2.50 and $3.50 a taco, with fillings including grilled pork and beef. Quesadillas were also available, and cost between $4.50 and $5, depending on the fillings. I had a grilled pork taco and a beef taco, and that turned out to be too little for me. The tacos could be devoured in three bites! The pork was delicious and the beef was a little on the dry side. So I ended up ordering a vegetarian quesadilla to supplement my order, and the tortilla was nice and soft, and the cheese not too overwhelming. I also had a strawberry magarita ($20) here. You have two options: a double shot or a double double shot of tequila. Yes, that means four shots. I opted for the single double, and that in itself was pretty strong. Thanks, you've successfully added this place! Se\u00f1or Taco isn't the best place I've ever had Mexican food, but it is very reasonably priced, considering I had a decent meal and drink for about $30. It's not a great place to sit if you're dying from the Singapore heat, but, if you're used to it, it's definitely a more affordable alternative compared to the neighbouring outlets.",

    "text": "Avoid Avoid Avoid If it were possible to give a place zero stars i would have. We got 4 tacos, a sizzling beef fajita, a corona and a coke zero for a whopping $76ish~ The price cannot be helped especially in the clarke quay area but the food was bland and service was truly unacceptable. Tacos were tasteless and only rescued by their provided range of sauces. Their signature al pastor taco was sparsely filled and the pineapple topping was mildly fizzy- the taste you get when pineapples are on the verge of spoilage. My biggest problem however, was with the fajitas we were served. We were seated next to two men who similarly ordered the sizzling fajitas but the vegetarian version. We then noticed that the waitress had mistakenly served them our plate of fajitas as it had beef on and also that one of the men had distractedly started eating off that plate. Another waiter having noticed the serving error removed the beef plate from the table next to us and proceeded towards the far end of the restaurant to inform the same waitress of her error. The next thing we saw was the very same plate of sizzling beef fajita that was removed from the table next to us then being served to us despite it having already had a bite taken out of it!!!!! When swerved i asked the waitress directly if it was indeed the same plate and she reassured us that it wasn't, but unless the kitchen managed to work some magic in the span of less than a minute or the plate in her hands had telekinetically switched i'm pretty sure we were served the same plate of fajitas wrongly served to, and eaten by, the men next to us which is grossly unhygienic and unacceptable. \u200d This sort of service coupled with bad quality food and overinflated prices makes for a place that doesn't deserve even a star.",

The corn tortillas are authentic but are a little on the dry side. Same for the marinated pork/chicken. The meat was overcooked and rather dry. However, the sauces are definitely authentic.Perusing the menu, there were also a couple of authentic-looking central Mexican dishes that looked good to try, but I didn't get the opportunity on this visit. I saw enchiladas, sopas, quesadillas. The menu is available on the website.One problem is the atmosphere, where they played mostly outdated 90s and 00s house and pop music at ear-splittingly loud levels even on an empty mid-week night...Quality and taste-wise, the tacos are okay, bordering on meh. But at around S$8/pop, I'll have to find a way to limit my taco cravings and eat something else instead...",

Coming from LA I do admit that I set a high bar for Mexican food. We ordered the chips with guacamole (probably the best dish of the meal), tacos (which were not bad but should come in smaller sizes in stead of one single huge tortilla), enchiladas, salad (which I do NOT recommend). Drinks were A-OK :)One thing I have to say about the service: They cleared our plates even when we said no... Which was a huge turn off. It is not like there were people queueing so I just didn't understand the rush.All in all it's probably worth a visit, just one though unless food quality goes up.",

    "text": "If I had to pick one type of food that's been difficult to find here in Singapore, it would be Mexican. In a country where great food from all walks of life is fairly easy to find, my one criticism would be trying to locate a decent Mexican joint with traditional tacos. I had a hunch that Singapore would probably not have many options for Mexican, seeing as the countries are miles apart. I knew after moving from the states that I would have to curb my Mexican cravings, which I've learned to manage since Singapore offers other great varieties of food. At one point though, I hit a wall and needed a taco fix. After searching high and low, I did manage to find a place that I can somewhat rely on now when I need a taco fix. Senor taco in Clark Quay offers decent tacos. Granted, I have had way better in my life, but again, I'm in Singapore and I knew I had to curb my expectations a bit. The beef and pork tacos are nice, and the different hot sauces they offered were quite decent. The service was nothing to brag about, but I wasn't expecting top notch service at a place like this. The only drawback was the loud music they felt they needed to blast. I enjoy my fair share of hip-hop, but I don't think you need to blast it as loud as possible on a Tuesday evening. Also, if you have kids, it might be best not to bring them here as they don't play the \"clean\" versions of these songs. If you don't care that your young ones are exposed to explicit lyrics, then it won't be a problem. The tacos at the Orchard location were actually tastier and the service was great there. They also didn't blast the music to the point where your ears felt like bleeding. The only drawback there is it's right behind Orchard Towers, and well, I don't really need to explain what you'll see there while dining at the location.",

It's conveniently located in the middle of Clarke Quay, which is great if you just want a bite to eat while people watching, but if you're seriously in the mood for some good tacos, do yourself a favour and walk 5-10 minutes over to Super Loco over on Robertson Quay.",

No matter how drunk, how strong the craving is for mexican, or how cheap the prices look, Do Not Give In.Possibly the worst taco in all of Asia (and there are a lot of crappy mexican joints gunning for that title). Head over to the Senor Taco in Chijmes for a better experience, or pony up some cash for a Lucha Loco speciality. Whatever you do, don't fulfill your dreams of carne asada or carnitas deliciousness at this pit stop for college drunks.",

    "text": "Clarke Quay can be very expensive. Sometimes you want something cheap. And if you're drunk, you want something greasy. Senor Taco is open late to satisfy your craving for greasy Mexican. Tacos are authentic -- corn tortillas with meat, extra for cheese. Topped with cilantro and onions. What I like most is they bottles of sauce (chipotle sauce, guacomole sauce, super spicy, etc). Considering that guacamole is very expensive in Singapore, I just drown my tacos in the green guacamole sauce. It's not real guacamole, but it's got the taste.Tacos are $2.50-$3 SGD each, and you can order 1 for a snack or as many as you want. \u00a0A cheap way to satisfy the Mexican craving in Singapore.",
