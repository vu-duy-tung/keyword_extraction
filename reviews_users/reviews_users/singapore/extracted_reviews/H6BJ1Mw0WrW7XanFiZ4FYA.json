But that one visit is never enough because their cakes are just so addictive!The decor for this place is just the cutest and brightens up my day when I walk in and see how beautifully the cupcakes and cakes are displayed. But it definitely is not all just show, cause the cakes take just as good as they look.My personal favourite is the Ferrero Rocher cake. It looks intimidatingly rich and I hesitated when I first bought it. I couldn't stop eating it after my first bite - moist, light, flavourful and not too sweet. Also, their icing is the only icing I have ever been able to bear eating. It's unbelievably creamy and light while having the perfect amount of sweetness. I also highly recommend their tres leche. PRO TIP: If you like sea salt chocolate, pick up one of their large sea salt chocolate chip cookies for just $1.50. It made my day.",

    "text": "\"Yet another one joins the fray...bet this one won't last a year...\" I said to myself as I scrolled through ladyironchef 2 years ago, back when cupcakes were all the rage. Well, I stand corrected. Recently got my paws on 2 boxes of these delicious cupcakes and I can finally see why this establishment is still as popular as when it first started out!The sponge base is fluffy and moist throughout, making it enjoyable down to the last bite. Each cupcake is topped generously with cream of a specific flavor that never fails to complement its base. I personally like how fluff bakery manages to stay competitive by regularly introducing novel flavors with aesthetically pleasing toppings, I.e.: the Bandung flavored cupcake, salted caramel shards embedded on a generous swirl of cream cheese! Certainly, each cupcake is a work of art and a sight to behold! Protip: Come early to avoid being disappointed as the popular flavors are known to sell out quickly.",

Their cupcakes are made fresh everyday and there is a limited amount sold per day. So if you really crave for one, be sure to be early and not late, before someone else before you steals that last remaning piece.",

    "text": "Located right in front of the bus stop opposite the primary school is Fluff Bakery, according to previous reviews, you could only get one dozen cupcakes per person. But now, I guess who doesn't want extra business, THERE'S NO LIMIT to the number of cupcakes you can buy! But they do sell out.We were queueing at 1120am and we were the 5th in line, here's the queue at 1145am and at 1245pm, the queue was just as long too, even though the bakery had been opened for 45 minutes.Just 15 minutes before opening, a staff comes out to write the variety of sugary treats that they will be selling today.Everything sounded so good, as you read down the list, and as you peer through the glass window, you can see them for yourself. I JUST WANT A SUGAR OVERDOSE RIGHT MEOW!The nutella red velvet and salted caramel are always available, it's the remaining 4 that rotates.Being the fifth in line, as we walked in, we had a good choice of what we wanted to try.As we were cafe hopping the whole day, I couldn't order 2 of everything to bring home. OR I would've! I did see the girls in front of me order something like $60 worth of cupcakes. Each cupcake is priced at $4. A heft price tag on a cupcake. But it's worth sharing, to simply eat one whole cupcake by yourself will engulf yourself in pure guilt and sugar high!1. BandungI loved the bandung cupcake above all other cupcakes in the world! The frosting itself had the sweet aroma of bandung. The cake itself was subtly sweet and in the center core was a jam of bandung. Of the 3 cupcakes we tried, this was the least sweet and I could not get enough of it. You will not feel gerlat, or heaty from this cupcake unlike the other two.Check out the bandung in the center. It is simply heavenly!2. Dark Chocolate Cookie Dough Liquid CheescakeThe dark chocolate cookie dough on the top was really hard, I could tell it was frozen for a bazillion years before getting topped on top of this cupcake. The cake itself wasn't too sweet, but the liquid cheesecake inside was a bit salty. A good blend of the cake itself. 3. Triple Nutella Hazelnut BrittleOkay so for a sweet tooth person, I don't like overly sweet stuff and this cupcake was too sweet for me. This was a bit of a let down, being that I loved every word in the name of this cupcake. Right in the center you have the traditional Nutella which is always sweet, but compared to the other two cupcakes, it was SUPER DOOPER sweet. It was beyond sweet, I starting digging for my water bottle, which I had misplaced. Nonetheless, I do give them credit for this cupcake.My conclusion is, the reason why people love Fluff bakery cupcakes is because of their interesting and creative flavours and because as people queue up for these cupcakes, THEY ARE FRESH!",

    "text": "Heard about this from my friend but had not have the chance to try it out till today.Reached the place at around 11.20am even though they start their business at 12pm. Saw some staffs came outside to update their menus (on the blackboard and on the glass window) before it opens. And they also added cupcakes on their cupcake racks. I was number 5 on the queue and it was not as bad as I expected. The staffs opened this store up punctually at 12pm and at that time, crowds started forming behind me. The store can only accommodate 4-5 people at a time as it had only a small walkway for you to enter and exit. First batch of people went in and they bought quite a number of baked goods (from tarts to cakes to cupcakes). And yup, they carried a number of boxes while they came out.It was my turn and I entered the store and just got the Triple Nutella Hazelnut brittle. They gave me a box for one cupcake. After taking orders from me and packed my cupcake in a box, I queued to pay at the cashier section. It was very orderly manner and it was fast and efficient. As there was no seating available, only take-outs, Mel Y. and I headed to another place to consume the cupcakes. Mel gotten the Bandung Cupcake and the dark chocolate cookie dough liquid cheesecake.We tried all the cupcakes and have to agree that the Bandung one was the top among the three cupcakes we purchased. We also agreed that the cupcakes are perfectly moist and flavorful. Inside the cupcakes there are also other fillings. For the cupcake I chose, there were nutella fillings inside it. But I have to admit that the cupcake I purchased was pretty sweet for my tastebuds even though I am a dessert junkie.They rotate the flavors around and kept two flavors the same every week. Do check their Facebook page to see the latest updates on the baked goods they serve that day. They also managed to sell the baked goods pretty fast (2-3 hours). So if you do want to come here to give it a try, I recommend going there and queue up early. :)",
