    "text": "Let me just start off by saying that this is the best service I've ever received in Singapore. I've never had wait staff be so kind or accommodating to me, especially when I'm one of those pesky caf\u00e9 patrons who are there for the wifi. I'm definitely a demanding customer at times and they've always worked with me and with a smile! Once I was seated, I needed an outlet and they found a table with one, unplugged the diffuser that was currently using the outlet, and helped me move my things there. This kind of hospitality and problem solving is definitely rare in Singapore. The food here is amazing as well. I had their King Caesar Salad and was expecting the same bland grilled chicken that every restaurant serves but no, this chicken had crackly skin and was delicious and flavorful! I also ordered a chammomile tea with longan and expected it to get a pot with a bag of nice tea inside. Nope! I got a clear pot full of the individual ingredients. I've never received tea like that at a caf\u00e9. It was such a pleasant surprise! Finally, finally, I must give a shout out to their music. Whoever put together their playlist would have probably been my best friend in high school because it is such a random assortment of music I love but haven't heard in so long like Jennifer Love Hewitt's \"Bare Naked\" or \"Back to the Beginning\" from the Anastasia soundtrack. I have never been in a place where I actually know the obscure songs. The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's so great, it makes it difficult for me to explore other places in my neighborhood because I'm happy to go here every time I need to work out of the office.",

    "text": "Nice place to chill around the Farrer park area.Passed by this place once and wanted to head over for lunch but unfortunately my friend chose another dining site instead.Came here at 2 pm on a Wednesday after lunch and stayed more than 2 hours here. The door opening was pretty small and the door was tough to push. And the waitress helped me out and guided me to a seating which is brightly lit. Was also given menus to look at (the interesting part was when they gave me alcoholic menu to look at). Without much hesitation, decided to order a slice of cake and tea in a teapot. Headed to the counter to see the available cake slices for the day and Thai milk tea cheesecake caught my eyes. For the tea, I headed for fruity tea and hence I ordered blissful berries tea.The Thai milk tea taste was pretty mild but the cheesecake was silky and smooth; not too sweet either. Price wise it is reasonable for a decent slice of cake.The berry tea was strong (depending how long you soak the tea leaves) and it has strong smell. I tend to go for a stronger aftertaste so I consumed it when it was darker in color. The tea came in a clear glass pot so you will see the color changes overtime (from the tea leaves) and you will see the floating berries as well.Service was alright here. More servers to cater to more customers. So one will be greeted and served pretty quickly.Love the antique touch in this cafe. It is also a good place to hang out and chill. Small touches added to increase the vibrancy of the cafe. I'll come back to try out their mains another time.",
