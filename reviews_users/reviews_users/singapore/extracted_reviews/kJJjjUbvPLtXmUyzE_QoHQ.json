    "text": "A few hits. The rest so so but overpriced. What's good:Dried fish crispsDried cuttlefish - but we love this kinda stuff and my friend said oh like the one we had in Hanoi on the streets. Of course that portion was much bigger. Beef wagyu skewer (3 cubes) $40. This was yummy and melty and succulent.Eggplant with shio - Pretty bland. Regret ordering this.Eggplant with white miso - This was quite enjoyable.Gingko nuts - This was very tasty but my friend said similar to NanbanteiSweet potato - I told my friend to forego this but she wanted to try. Utterly boring and tasted like plain steamed sweet potato and overpriced.There were a few other items but I can't remember them now but the minced chicken with cartilage on a stick with onsen egg was one of the best items in terms of flavour, texture and good value.Kinki fish - this was kinda disappointing as it costs $88 and the chef burnt the cheek and jaw early! I saw it from where I was sitting and told my friends but it was partially obscured so I didn't say anything to the chef. My friends said hopefully it was just the edge of the jaw but when it came it was dry on that side and the cheek meat was shriveled up. No apologies from the chef or restaurant although this was noticeable and in fact I saw when the chef had seen it black the first time because he quickly covered it with foil and sprayed water under the foil repeatedly and kept checking and looking at it (prob hoping for the burnt bits to be steamed off). For the price and the calibre that this restaurant is, they really should have just rejected it themselves. In the end after trying it, my friend called the server over to tell him and the moment he saw the black part he knew. I told him that look we accepted it because we are nice and don't want the chef in trouble, but it's not because we are clueless that the cheek is supposed to be an important part! He apologised..As it was the end of our meal, he asked us if he could clear the plates and said \"we have fruits for you\". So we said ok. Slices of melon were brought out and we later saw on the bill that they were charged to us at around $12 a slice!! We felt cheated but it was my friend's birthday and we were treating her and she seemed a bit disappointed in the food also, so we didn't want to kick up a fuss and bring the atmosphere down further. Also, we had to rush for our next appointment.",

    "text": "A very touristy place which is open very late and thus was the only reason we frequented it.You choose from the items laid out in front of you - fresh fish, seafood, vegetables - and the chefs will prepare it on their grills. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about.The food is fresh, yes, but I do not like being recommended the most expensive item there is without being told. We actually wanted a specific fish but were recommended another one - only to find out that this particular one made a dent of S$ 90 in our bill. Needless to say, the total bill was pretty astronomical, for an \"ok\" meal.I do expect to be told the cost of anything that is recommended to me so I can make an informed decision. We did not think of asking the price as it was a small fish and honestly just trusted the guy (we've dined at exclusive places where something like this has never happened to us). What he had actually recommended was one of the most expensive fish on the planet (Kinki, or thornhead).We were pretty upset and vowed never to set foot in here again.",

    "text": "Food was perfect, simple and beautiful. We had never been to anything like this before so was a wonderful experience. The downside is that pricing is not transparent and to be honest completely off the scale. \u00a0We were charged for obligatory sides like fruit and small greens (for 2 people came to 22 dollars alone and is apparently standard practice in Japan) so be aware of this. We did pick the most amazing wagu beef stick \u00a0(3 \u00a0x 1 inch square pieces on a stick) which was 40 sing a pop! If we had known (and we most likely should of asked but they were not giving to much away) we would of not requested it Lolz. Would give this 5 stars however it's the pricing transparency that lets it down for us as our pockets are definitely not that deep for a Saturday night meal en route back to Australia. 250 sing including taxes was a little unexpected for a small meal and we couldn't help but feel slightly ripped off.",

So i thought ok...lets do this. \u00a0Called up made a reservation for 3 and i was there at 6pm and was the first. \u00a0I was greeted Japanese style (kinda reminded me in Army where you are supposed to acknowledge orders given) by all the staff but i notice one thing peculiar - the staff if i am not wrong are all Japanese. \u00a0And in my mind I told myself \"you are gonna get it!\".Family came shortly after and i went on an ordering binge. \u00a0I ordered 3 orders of each of Shrimp, Beef, Asparagus,garlic, onion, \u00a0Mushroom, Sweet Potatoes, Fish, Scallop and can't remember the rest. \u00a0take away is everything is grilled to perfection! \u00a0The beef especially hits the spot as it was crispy on the outside but perfect medium rare on the inside....then comes the home run the bill. Not sure if i could read everything i ordered but it came to i remember $640 without alcohol :). \u00a0oouch to the wallet but salute to the skill of the chef. \u00a0i could never replicate that even if i try for years.take away is... if you got a business dinner and want to impress this will be the place to go instead of heading to japan. \u00a0On a personal level i would hold it back and go for shirokane tori-tama at Robertson Quay.",
