    "text": "Ok, I get it now. I understand why the queues here are out of control.I've heard so much about this fabled, no frills sushi place in the most random location inside Far East Plaza. My husband and I are not the types to want to queue for food; we'd rather go to a place that's less crowded and costs more than to wait for cheap but satisfying bites*.Luckily, we had some time to kill on a Saturday so we decided to give it a shot. I ordered the aburi salmon roll and \"normal\" chirashi, while Miguel got the premium chirashi**. On the menu, it mentions that the chirashis will be a 15-minute wait.We get the aburi salmon roll first, and mm MM MMM it was delicious, melt in your mouth amazeballs! However, when the chirashis were delivered, they immediately stole the show. I felt like I was attending the funeral of all the fish from the SEA Aquarium. Look at how many (dead, beautifully cut up, fresh) fishes are in there! I must admit that we came in \"medium hungry\", so we actually had trouble finishing our food. (No worries, we eventually did, as we knew it would be horrible to waste amazing fish like that.) But I'm pretty sure if I came in hangry, I'd be fully satisfied after a chirashi + aburi salmon roll.I still wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes in the queue for this place, but I will no longer judge those who are willing to do so!*Also, one of us is the impatient type. I won't say who.**For dem basic bitches, they also have a basic chirashi. Apparently, the fish will be cubed instead of sliced.",

I just pulled up my yelp app, typed \"sushi\" in the search bar and this spot popped up. As a bonus, it's only a couple of blocks away from our home. My husband and I decided to meet for lunch so we decided to try The Sushi Bar. We walked in a little after 12:00 and were seated immediately. The service was very prompt and attentive. We both ordered the miso soup. It is the best miso soup I have had since moving to Singapore. We decided to split some rolls. We ordered the spicy tuna maki, soft shell crab and due to the yelp tips, the salmon alburi roll. The spicy tuna maki is a very simple roll, but absolutely delicious. It was probably my favorite roll out of the three. The soft shell crab roll was wonderful as well. It was also presented beautifully. The salmon alburi was probably my least favorite of the three. I did not love the texture, but it was still tasty. We left the Sushi Bar feeling full and satisfied. The best part? We only paid $44 SGD for 2 soft drinks, 2 miso soups and 3 rolls. We will certainly be back! Thanks for the suggestion fellow yelpers!",

I came here for dinner, ordering the famous salmon aburi sushi, wagyu skewers, salmon kabuto miso pot and the scallop carpaccio. The ambience is definitely mediocre but the taste of the food is able to make up for it. The prices are pretty reasonable unless you move up the scale and go for premium stuff, that can set you back about $75-$100 per person. Otherwise you can get away with about $50 per person. They don't stinge on the portions and the food is worth the wait after you have ordered. The crowd here tends to be young, 20s to 30s and somehow you don't really see a matured crowd.",

Anyway, big tip - you can now do SMS/whatsapp reservations! Awesome. There is always a long line when I go, and then I'm very thankful for having made a reservation. Lesson learnt from the first time we tried to walk in.. This gem is hidden in an obscure part of Far East Plaza - I can never remember how to get there and end up wandering around the 3rd floor. But just follow your nose :p Or else, come up the escalators which are nearer to Goodwood Park (as opposed to the escalators nearer to Grand Hyatt) and I think it should be on that side..Aburi salmon roll ($14.50)! Aburi scallop roll ($16.90)! Scallop mentaiyaki ($13.90!) All the flame grilled goodness you could ask for :) And mayo. Although thankfully there isn't an overabundance of it, I think Koh Grill and Sushi goes heavier on the mayo.Chirashi ($24.90) is usually a gd deal too! Comes with a fair amount of fish and seafood. 3 Kind sashimi ($14.90) pretty gd deal too, fish slices are fairly large.Oh, top up your own tea/water service. I mean, no extra tax and GST, you gotta serve yourself man :)",

I'm impressed by the young chef behind the Sushi Bar and his team of young and enthusiastic staff. Can't be too harsh on them given that it's really a small restaurant and it's always packed.

It was good but still not great. \u00a0Another thing I noticed was the lack of hygene in the handling of the soy sauce dishes. \u00a0The guy stuck his thumb right on the top surface of where people pour their soy sauce. \u00a0Some people may not care or pay attention to details like this but this germaphobe won't be returning here. \u00a0They set \"The Sushi Bar\" way too low to be enjoyed by this foodie.",

The restaurant was extremely hard to find, no one knew where it was and we were misdirected 3 times before we finally found it on the 4th floor. Once we got in we were quickly seated, and the servers promptly gave us tea and took our orders. They were very friendly and helpful, giving us suggestions on what to order and portion control. We ordered a small sashimi sampler, 3 rolls from the chefs recommendation menu, and wagyu aburi sushi (best idea ever!!) The sashimi was super thick and delicious, but I have to say my fav was the wagyu melt on your tongue aburi sushi and the scallop roll. Made the trip well worth. If you have a couple if hours to kill and an urge to go on an adventure, give this place a try! Itll for sure satisfy your starving stomach after the treacherous journey to get here.",

The fish was amazing, the tofu bowl - the broth especially - was very tasty and the scallop carpaccio divine.I found my favourite beer (Suntory premium) and the service was very friendly and fast. The interior is modern, but more on the functional side. Anyhow, you do not come here for the furnishings, you come here for sushi. I wouldn't take a first date or celebrate my anniversary here, but I'll certainly be back for their delectable sushi and good service, at a price tag that doesn't involve cringing when you see the bill.",

There is a promotion where you get 3 rolls for the price of 2, and my companion, by some oversight, ordered the prawn, soft shell crab, and salmon rolls, which all happened to be aburi-ed. I loved the rolls, but three aburi-ed rolls which sort of taste the same after a while, for 2 people, are a bit much, and hence we struggled to finish the rolls, which resulted in a fair bit of waste. We also got the normal chirashi, a portion of salmon sashimi, a pitan tofu. The chirashi was topped with thickly sliced fish of various varieties, and the rice was sufficiently vinegared. Yum!My favorite was the pitan tofu. Tofu is actually a misnomer as they use egg custard as the tofu, and then top it with century eggs, flying fish roe, spring onions, and shredded surimi. I really liked this.Prices here are very reasonable for what they are. I guess this is the Singapore version of hole-in-the-wall sushi, tucked in a corner of Orchard Road. They should probably have a sake shot promo, just to value-add.",

The salmon is torched so this dish is suitable for diners who are not into raw food. The ingredients go well together. The unagi avocado roll was a rip off in my opinion. I understand that unagi is not cheap but not a lot of it was given and 5 pieces of sushi at $17.90 before tax were not worth it. The other sushi rolls had more portions and value for money. Only cash or nets is accepted.",

But after we found it and waited in line, it was so worth it!I had the normal churasi don plate which was a nice selection of fish, including salmon, smoked salmon, tuna, scallop, egg, salmon roe and another one I can't remember! All are top quality and generously sized pieces. Husband had the smoked salmon roll, some salmon sushi, and two hand rolls. The hand rolls were like deconstructed cut rolls with a twist.If you want to go exotic and get premium sashimi, you can do this here too.

Hidden on the 4th floor of Far East Plaza, a mall that needs some upgrading to compete with its rivals. My first impression of the place is this must be a low cost type Japanese restaurant as its interior and menu matches to my impression but the cost of the food is at a different level! I ordered the Normal Chirashi Set (A bowl of rice with a mixture of assorted meat) that cost $24 to try out since I was told how good the food is. When my meal was served, my eyes \"popped\" out when I saw the portion of the meat, it's probably the most generous portion I come across in Singapore so far. My first bite of it has made me craved for more. While engaging a conversation with my friend, I can't help but to enjoy every bite of it; multi-tasking at the same time. (Eating 70% and listening 30%) It was that enjoyable. I had the Chawamushi (Steamed egg) and that's pretty decent, so for the $30+ I paid for the meal, it's certainly worth the enjoyment. Like they say, sometimes it's good to spend more for good food, this is one example.",

You can taste the smokiness of the seared salmon and it is not too overpowering. The sushi has a good balance of fish and rice. The presentation is good. The premium chirashi is equally satisfying. Lots of fresh seafood and too little rice though the amount is just right to fill you up. The premium chirashi has seasonal items (uni, prawn and maybe others which are not included in the regular chirashi) and so is the price. Mine was $38.90 which I felt was reasonable given the 3 pieces of uni and sheer quantity of fish. I loved the aburi salmon and salmon belly in it. It is crowded during lunch time, so you will need to wait to get a table. They lost our reservation though, so we took the counter seats until a table was free. For a small place, there are 6 people in the tiny kitchen slicing and dicing and cleaning. It is a decent, no frills sushi bar focusing on fresh and good food. I will go back again.Oh, you can also request for fresh wasabi which is $4 extra. It is definitely better than the usual wasabi which is made from powder/paste.",

The Chirashi comes with an eclectic assortment of fish including: salmon, aburi salmon (my personal fav), tuna, yellowtail, swordfish, scallop, fish roe and tomago. The fish portions are thick, so you won't feel short changed after finishing the dish. My only complaint, if any, was the small layer of rice underneath the sashimi. I'm a huge sushi rice eater, so this could be a personal complaint. Fortunately, this was easily remedied by ordering an extra order of rice.I'm a huge fan of the Sushi Bar, almost to the point of obsession. The lines are long, but It's worth the wait, trust me!",

Quality-wise, I thought that it was on par with more expensive places like Sushi Tei or Itacho sushi.Everyone orders the aburi salmon rolls- and with good reason. These were fantastic! The salmon was perfectly-seared and came in thick slices, and the mentaiko mayo on the top of the rolls complemented the rest of the ingredients well. For both dishes, the fish:rice ratio was 2:1, which was impressive considering that it's usually the reverse in similarly-priced places.Wasabi was better than the usual but lacked the clears-your-nose-immediately spiciness of the freshest kinds.

There is a long line outside and all parties must be present to be seated, but it is quite worth the wait. They just opened a new outlet on level 3 of the same building but offers only 80% of the menu. We opted to wait for a table, and it only took 10min on a Sat night at 645pm. The salmon and salmon belly sashimi are generously sliced and rather fresh. The famed salmon aburi roll did not disappoint, while the sirloin steak was tender, juicy, fragrant and perfectly grilled. It reminds me of the steak at New Ubin seafood which I absolutely love!We also had the \"upgraded\" miso soup - some salmon fish/head soup which was very sweet :)Enjoyed my dinner very much and definitely looking forward to coming back again!",
