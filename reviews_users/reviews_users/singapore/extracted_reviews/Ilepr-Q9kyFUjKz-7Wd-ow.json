Service not great I sat at bar for 7 mins before anyone asked me if I wanted anything , and I was one of 3 people sitting at bar. Beef obviously frozen not fresh. Super market \u00a0has better beef \u00a0, medium rare means juicy pink Center. Not Gray mushy. I won't be back.",

Seems they directly import 80/20 USDA Beef, (80% beef, 20% fat), mission critical for the juicy output. Grey Poupon mustard, a +. It is expensive, all in S$20.95 for just a Cheeseburger, bar served me a cold 'sky juice' for free, (and I would have screamed bloody mercy if they hadn't). And to their credit, it wasn't tap water. Very convenient to Telok Ayer DT Line. I'm not a fries fan, so passed on those as well as a $4 bottle of Dasani! Landlords victor again, damned our Singapore Inc. is expensive.",

    "text": "The burger joint has come toSingapore and while it in some ways is better than the original (good selection of beers!) it is worse in other ways (longer lines and worse value for money). It has stayed true to the original in the way that it is sort of half hidden, in this case in a back alley with the characteristic burger sign guiding you to its location. The place is fairly big and while slightly chaotic with orders being accepted at the food counter and then beer orders at the bar (but if you're lucky or ask nicely they may accept your food order there as well). The burgers are very good and to me are at the same quality level as the original burger joint and the beers are also excellent. What is however my main objection is the price level - count on 30+ SGD for a meal and easily well above 40 if you want beer and anything other than a basic small burger and fries. Still the prices are clearly displayed so just a matter of deciding whether worth it. It is one of the better burgers in Singapore so I will probably try it now and then.",

    "text": "Decent burgers hidden from view along Gemmill Lane.The address may state Amoy street, but you should enter via Gemmill Lane. The Singapore edition of Burger Joint attempts to recreate that greasy, divey, hole in the wall NYC experience with a hidden entrance, with only a neon burger sign pointing the way. The interior is also decorated similar to the New York outlet.I found the burgers OK, with the ingredients fresh, the patty suitably juicy and with the necessary toppings but still lacking that distinctive taste. S$25 for a double cheeseburger is also a bit expensive. I also got the boozy (baileys) shake, which was rather thin and arrived in a small cup that set me back S$15.This place has been open less than a week and I think that they still need to get their operations ironed out. The line was extremely long, but not well managed. The trash cans were located near the front of the line, causing people to mill about and add to the crowd at the counter. It took a good 20 mins or more to receive my burger and shake.Overall, it's ok if you're coming in late in the evening, without the wait. But otherwise it's not worth squeezing with the hungry hordes to get your burger.(Full disclosure, I've not yet been to the actual NY outlet, but I'm comparing it with other burgers that I've had on the West Coast such as Umami, Super Duper, Shake Shack, Five Guys and In-N-Out.)",

However, if you bother actually looking and once you found it, you are in for a treat. Once through the door, you see heavy curtains blocking off a side of a restaurant and leading you to the area where you are to order your food. According to my friend - menu is what you usually get in the US, with the basic burger and add ons. This was after work on a Friday (meaning I get off work slighly earlier) and the place was fairly packed. You order at the counter and you collect the paper bags of food at the counter and there are tables. Burger was slighly smaller than what I expected it to be but it tasted good. Fries were decent. It comes with a price tag though - for a burger that size, I paid $19? Soft drinks were about $4.50-5.00. Not the cheapest, but heck, they do a decent burger.",

The beef - US beef, good texture and flavor, and 2). Real American cheese, melted and gooey; and 3). A bun that doesn't dissolve - sorry I really can't stand all of the burger joints that use a brioche. \u00a0I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with the works, which was a bit messy but totally worth it. \u00a0It's a bit pricey - about $32 for burger, fries and a soda, but that seems to be the going rate around here. \u00a0And actually, it does double as a true speakeasy, as they have a well-stocked bar with a decent whiskey selection and craft beers. \u00a0As I am in the area quite frequently for bar hopping, it's nice to also find a great burger place as well. \u00a0Amoy Street keeps getting better and better!",

    "text": "Hell. Yes. Best burgers in Singapore hands down.The Singapore edition of the Burger Joint from Le Parker Meridien New York did not disappoint. A bit pricey (about $15 for the burger alone) but definitely worth it. Juicy, USDA grade beef cooked however you want it, and made to order. There's also a full bar with a great selection of IPAs and a few lagers to wash down that beer with. If you're into whiskies, the bar has some American whiskey brands stocked.Regarding decor, this one tried to replicate how the one looks like in New York, with the graffiti on every surface (you can add some yourself) and the booths. The entire place is quite small, and can be packed during meal times, but it's worth it if you can squeeze in. The only negative is that sometimes the orders take a while, because there's only one grill at the back, so you can wait up to 15-20 mins during peak times. I've been here multiple times and brought friends since it's opened, and it hasn't disappointed any of us. Definitely come down and try it!",
