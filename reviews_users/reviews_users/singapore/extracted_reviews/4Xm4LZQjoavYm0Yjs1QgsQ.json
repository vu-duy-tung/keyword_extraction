    "text": "Wow! I can't believe that I found a Din Tai Fung here in the middle of Marina Bay Link mall. I came on a Saturday and surprise surprise the place was relatively empty. We got a seat immediately at 7pm. Contrast this to Tampines Mall or Wisma where you have to wait at least a good 30 minutes before being ushered during dinner peak hours.That already bumped my rating for this place up a little, and I realised they have fancy schmancy stuff here that perhaps can't be found in other Din Tai Fung outlets - for one the Truffle Xiao Long Bao. It's really pricey at 3.80 per bao but I suppose it will probably have a great aftertaste. The price put me off a little so didn't try but I would certainly recommend anyone to give it a go.I had the duck crepe thingy here and its really good! The duck aroma immediately fills your mouth the moment you pop each piece in, and it goes down really well when paired with fried rice.Service is a bit slow but staff are really helpful and courteous so this place gets a five-star from me.",

    "text": "There may be other, cheaper, places to get dumplings in Singapore, but I particularly appreciate the vegetarian options on the DTF menu. Vegetarian does NOT mean mushrooms or gooey tofu here. Not that there is a ton of variety, but they do the few vegetarian items that they do very well. The steamed vegetable dumplings are light and tasty. I love the plain noodle bowls with sauce over them. I believe the dan dan noodles and the noodles with peanut sauce (or house sauce or something) are vegetarian. At minimum, they are visibly meat-less. \u00a0 Admittedly, it is tough to get the staff to stick around your table long enough to answer detailed questions about the menu or ingredients because the place is constantly busy. Language has also been a slight barrier for me at times in cases where I want to know exactly what is in a dish. There are plenty of plates of lightly sauteed greens on the menu. Yawn. But the surprising favorite in the starters category are cucumbers dressed in some combo of vinegar and soy sauce plus lots of minced garlic. Ridiculous to order simple cucumbers in a restaurant! But I can't always resist, plus I prefer the dressing as a dumpling dip far more than the soy sauce-vinegar-ginger combo I can mix for myself at the table.",

Cos let's be honest, I don't know about you, but for me eating xiao long bao alone for a meal will never made me satisfied. Yeah yeah I know. I am a girl with a big appetite and I like varieties. I love that though Din Tai Fung is a chain restaurant, but they always maintain their standard really well. The food taste-wise is always consistent. Service is okay - not bad, but def could be improved. Please keep in mind that DTF is always crowded. So come at weird hours like 2.30 pm or 4.30 pm if you want to avoid long queue.They take reservation if you have 8 people or more in your group.",

    "text": "On a recent trip to Singapore, did my pilgrimage to the local DTF. Partially, because you can never get enough of what may be the best Xiao Long Bao dumplings in the world -- but also as a fan I wanted to compare to the Taiwan and L.A. versions.I will say that they aren't QUITE as good as those two. Mainly because, I understand, these are franchises rather than direct original family owned like in Taiwan and L.A. Also, they've opened a mind-boggling number of them in Singapore. We were eating in a DTF that was mere blocks from another branch in an adjacent mall.Even considering that, it is still 5-stars, because even a lesser XLB dumpling from Din Tai Fung by far trumps the best from anywhere else I've ever had. There is no comparison. I also am an advocate for the thinner, lighter skins they use versus the more traditional thicker wrapping. It highlights the filling.I will say the Singapore restaurants (and Taiwan) have somewhat larger variety than the L.A. branch. However, the juicy pork and juicy pork and crab are unbeatable so it's \"gilding the lily\". Actually, I personally didn't like the truffle dumpling -- which seems to be only available in Asian branches -- very much. I also had the opportunity to eat some other, non-dumpling dishes since my in-laws like the variety and I have to say that DTF also excelled in those as well. Of course, while well executed, these dishes aren't the revelation that their XLB are. I will shamelessly quote another reviewer, Mel P., because they said it perfectly: \"Din Tai Fung should be some kind of universal translations for 'best dumpling ever'\".",

Wow, I can't stop saying Wow!The restaurant is crowded, but the service is excellent. +++ Pork dumpling in the spicy sauce: Head down for this one. If I ever mentioned the pork dumpling in spicy sauce is good at So.Cal, I probably never had any better until this one shows up. The flour dough is thin and smooth, meat is juicy, tender, fresh and tasty and the sauce that goes with it is lightly seasoned, but it wasn't bland.You can taste every single ingredients in the bowl. Mr.Q and I ordered 3 times from the same dish. That's how good it is. +++ Truffle xiao long bao: \u00a0Normally I am not very fascinated about truffles. However, \u00a0this time the truffle did work together with the pork bun. The pork bun has a nice aroma of the truffle and also the freshness and the tenderness of the meat filling. Mouth watering when I try to remember how I bite the xiao long bao open and have a sneak peek inside, trying to not drop the xiao long bao while admire it. \u00a0A excellent must try dish.+++ Xiao long bao: The flour dough is thin, the soup broth is the bun is tasty and the temperature of the soup is just nice, It didn't burn my tongue. The pork filling is juicy, tender and fresh. +++Duck roll: Smoked duckling meat in a crispy layer of the spring roll. The duck meat is lightly smoked, chewy(in a good way) and salty, but the green onion and the crispy spring roll balanced the tasty salty duck meat. \u00a0An excellent dish.--+ Oriental salad in special vinegar dressing: Crisps greens and soggy rice vermicelli. The sauce wasn't overpowering the salad. However, there wasn't anything special about this dish. -++ Crab meat xiao long bao: It tasted similar to the xiao long bao, however the crab meat texture is a little bit dry and the broth in the bun is a bit lukewarm. +++ Steamed red bean bao: The flour dough looks puffy. The bun was fluffy and the filling were lightly sweetened. \u00a0The aroma of red bean and yam is strong and the filling were moist. It wasn't chunky at all.  +++Lemongrass juice was exotic and interesting. It definitely gives you the coolness in the super hot city.The only cons that I can think of this place is \" Dear manager, please get rid of the Christmas decorations from last year\". I highly recommend this DTF for all my Yelpers, if you have the chance to visit Singapore, it's a must go.",

    "text": "Woohoo! First SG review!What to say except that the dimsums were fabulous? My friend and I ordered quite a lot of food actually, maybe too much, but it felt so right as we were eating these dumplings! We tried steamed dumplings with vegetables, pork, shrimp and crab. Also, we tasted the dates filled with rice and the chili wanton soup. My absolute favorites: the shrimp, and then the veggies.Then, we gave a shot to the sweet dumplings and were absolutely amazed by the coconut peanut ones. As for the red beans, they were not too sweet but the peanut was particularly flavorful. Also, we tried the almond and sesame pudding: quite odd to say, but the almond tasted a bit artificial while the sesame's bitterness was just perfect. Overall, excellent dishes for about $60.Only complaint: the service. I don't know if it's considered normal in SG, but the waiters exclusively spoke Mandarin and the bill was also in Mandarin. My friend who lives here was also shocked, so I guess there could be room for improvement.I guess I'll go back for sure just for the shrimp and the peanut. Except if I find another dimsum place that has even more outstanding flavors!",

    "text": "What more needs to be said about Din Tai Fung? The chain leaves Crystal Jade in the dust. Honestly, why do people in Singapore still go to Crystal Jade? That's the kind of crazy they don't even have medication for.I, for one, am not a fan of the truffle xiao long bao (this may be controversial). I'm an XLB purist (I don't even need vinegar or ginger) and believe the truffle flavour overpowers the awesome minced pork & fat flavour. Din Tai Fung makes a good, solid, dependable basic XLB and you should order like 20 as soon as you sit down. Per person.Apart from the XLB, I like the pork chop fried rice, the drunken chicken and this prawn pancake thing they have (I forget the name of the dish on the menu). Why people still order dan dan mien here is totally beyond me also. It tastes like nothing but peanuts, people! Check out the braised beef soup also, it's a gem.This particular DTF is an excellent venue for dinner because there is like, never a queue. Imagine walking straight into a DTF without taking a ticket or having to stand uncomfortably, propped up against a mall fixture, in a sea of people waiting for your number to pop up? A magical utopian wonderland, you say? No! It's Marina Bay Link Mall! Where nobody goes in the evening! Lunch, however, is a different story.",

    "text": "I'm take to this franchise and am attracted to DTF whenever I am overseas and come across its iconic red sign with Han letters. I'm also always quite surprised how so many Americans like the food here. It's interesting to see different form of their XLB - chicken instead of pork in the Indon one. I was always fascinated with the XLB that had assorted colors. It almost makes the meal look like it's something to play with - pink, green, yellow, etc.Other then the delicious pork XLB (they actually don't place the ginger in the soy sauce and eat them in Shanghai itself!), I usually go for the lamian (noodles) or fried rice when I am at DTF alone or not with a large group of friends.The lamian is pretty plain, but it's springly and soaks up the broth and tastes so good in your mouth - just plain noodles and broth. The soup is clear and slightly dark, with a thin layer of oil at the top. Scoop up a while eating the noodles to quench your thirst or if the chilli is too hot!I'm generally a happy man when I get fragrant fried rice with succulent prawns. Add some chilli for a kick!This outlet is pretty good but the people in the Raffles City one seem to one you to hurry up and finish your meal so they can prepare the table for the next guests. They charge for water too, I think.",

They wouldn't unless your glass was empty and would only refill one person at a time and left unless you specifically stated to refill everyone's glass.

    "text": "This place is so addicting!Many things have been said about their classic pork dumplings, but they really are the best! \u00a0the dough is not too thick or too thin, the meat is a perfect flavour, and the dumplings are steamed to perfection! \u00a0Little balls of heaven! :)I also love their fried rice - the egg fried rice is the best I have had yet, and tastes perfect. \u00a0I have fruitlessly tried to get good basic fried rice and have found that this place does it best.The garlic chili wantons are great as well, and come in a very tasty dark chili sauce. \u00a0They also have a small variety of vegetables which are enhanced by some garlic/sauce and taste very good. \u00a0I have tried the other varieties of dumplings, such as the vegetable ones and the pork and shrimp. \u00a0They are good but in my opinion, the classic pork ones are the best. \u00a0The vegetable ones seem a bit dry and the pork-shrimp ones have very thick dough.The food comes super fast when you're eating in, and of course seems to take longer when you're waiting for it as a take-away! \u00a0I am super addicted and don't mind the wait, because they make everything fresh. Regarding the setting - it's located in Marina Bay Link Mall - so basically in an underground tunnel which is also a shopping centre with various shops/cafes. \u00a0Its not the most relaxing ambiance, but I very much doubt people seek this place out for the amazing setting - the food makes it worth it and the restaurant itself is big enough where you can feel a bit removed if you don't sit right by the window.Overall, great food and consistent quality!",

    "text": "OK White guy alert here!! \u00a0I loved the place but I am not a connoisseur of Dim Sum. \u00a0Though, now I think I know what I need to know to at least write a review. The net of my experience there was that they are FAST and FRESH. \u00a0I don't know if that is a good thing in a traditional Dim Sum eatery but for us it was great. \u00a0They had a few entrees that were from a traditional kitchen, think of teriyaki chicken in a sushi restaurant. \u00a0The food came in shifts like sushi can and it was ALL GOOD. \u00a0Not great to me but it was good. \u00a0I would go back and I would wait in line to eat there.",

And you can watch them making your dumplings, so interesting and cool. Must go, must see and must try!We also loved their seaweed salad, vegetable dumplings, steamed veggies and one of my favorites - vegetable and tofu salad. Doesn't sound that great but tastes amazing.",
