    "text": "Affordable, authentic and delicious. Since I popped in here with some girlfriends I've brought at least 2 other groups of friends on other occasions and recommended Big Mama to many! I love the budae jigae - chock full of ingredients, and I love that it's quite spicy with a strong kimchi taste. I've unfortunately tried other places in SG where it tastes incredibly watered down, or just like instant ramen. Love the rice cakes too. The best part of korean restaurants are the unlimited banchan, and we especially loved the japchae (!). Any restaurant that serves japchae as an appetizer almost certainly becomes a favorite. I've also tried the kimchi seafood pancake here, and it's huge and shareable between 3-4 people if you're having it as a side. I loved how it was filled with squid and other seafood too, and also thick enough. The ambiance is not the main star here, but at least I didn't emerge smelling of korean barbecue as some places lead to. I actually really like the lively, chatty atmosphere. Service is also prompt. Reservations are required perhaps a week in advance if you'd like to eat at prime dining time (eg 7pm). We ended up only getting a 8pm reservations & had drinks & fries at another joint down the road. It's walking distance from Tiong Bahru MRT and not difficult to find at all",

    "text": "So my friend recommended this place for the 8 of us to indulge in some casual dining and to chill out, and the signature dish, the Dakgalbi, which is charged at $18/pax. Basically it's this giant stew-like pot of korean rice cakes, vegetables and chicken that they cook on the spot (or at least they show you that it's cooked on the spot), and yes it's really good! Disclaimer: Unfortunately, I'm no Korean and neither have I stepped onto that island before so I can't tell whether it is authentic. Nevertheless, the soup/gravy was relatively spicy (I'm a relatively light spicy eater) but it tasted good. The chicken meat was succulent and the rice cakes were chewy - again, I don't know what should authentic cakes taste like, but I definitely liked the chewy texture. We also got the Suyuk, but I felt that it was relatively expensive. It's basically strips of pork belly served with thin slices of cucumber, radish and beansprouts and 2 types of sauces. And you eat the pork belly with 1 condiment and 1 sauce. Well, if you want to kill your curiosity or if you want to see how a traditional Korean food looks like you can try it, but I don't think it's that value for money.Overall, there was 7 of us actually eating, and we paid about $30~ per person and we got away relatively full. So that's the price range you are looking at. But we sat there for around 2 hours (oops :X) This would be a good guide. Note: Water and Korean sides are free flow! (yay!)Bigmama offers a nice, casual ambience and we felt like we could talk alot without disturbing the other customers. The staff is friendly and service was nice. However, during the busy period, the wait-staff might be a bit lag, but that was fine.This shop is conveniently located, and is a mere 5-10 minute stroll from Tiong Bahru MRT. We went there on a Wednesday night at 6.30pm and it got pretty crowded by 7-8pm. Do reserve if you want to come in that timing because I'd noticed walk-in customers getting turned away because of lack of space.Good news: I just found they have a website so you can take a look at the menu before going bigmama.sg/#!tiong-barhu\u2026 (nope, I'm not paid to share this)Overall, I would like to bring other people to try this readily accessible, yet good food.",

For dinner, this branch almost guarantees seats cos the office crowd wudda gotten their fix over lunch. The atmosphere is very different compared to the Kim Tian branch, more upclass versus the latter's family-restaurant feel. Recommended for a group of 3-6 so you can order more items to share!",

The vegetarian pancake was quite appetising and I was quite pleased with it.",

    "text": "I finally tried Big Mama's Dak Galbi at Tiong Bahru! For a Tuesday night and they are fully occupied, that's impressive. We had to wait half an hour for a table. We ordered the Dak Galbi which tastes really so so if you have been to Korea and had Yu Ga Chicken Galbi. Of course, the cold weather in Seoul helps as well. We ordered 2 sets for 3 girls to share. It was sufficient if you are not a big eater as the portion is small and they have very little other side dishes added in such as the rice cake and vegetables. However, for the big eaters, do not worry. You may request to add rice at almost the end of your dakgalbi for them to fry with the red sauce and seaweed!!! The seaweed helps to make the fried rice tastes soooo much better I must say! The rice was the life saver or else I would have to go McDonalds afterwards! Hah Another this, sukyu was at best, 3 star as it is thinly sliced and has the sour sauce and spicy sauce to dip in. Makgeoli was undoubtedly good! Service is good. But, 3 star is given as it is like a home-cooked meal served in a restaurant. However, I will come back to try other dishes or as and when I crave for dakgalbi.",

So Bigmama is a favorite go-to restaurant. Their dakgalbi is flavourful and perfect for a rainy day. \u00a0It gets really busy, so make sure to make reservations. \u00a0If you have a spontaneous craving for it, your best bet is to drop in for a lunch there (definitely not dinner). \u00a0It's so good, you'll probably ending up over-eating and regretting your life..but that's not always a bad thing =P",

    "text": "(Read in \"The Most Interesting Man In The World's\" voice) I don't always eat Korean food, but when I do, I prefer Big Mama.No seriously though, this is probably the only Korean restaurant I can think of that I've been to in Singapore! I only come here for lunch when my colleagues have a Korean craving, and it gets the job done. Located on Kim Tian Road, I would say it's about a 5-7 minute walk from the Tiong Bahru MRT.It's been a while since I've eaten here, so I can't recall the exact dishes that we normally order. All I remember is that they are the ones that can be shared between 3-4 people. What I thought was unique was that some of the shared dishes are served in one of those pans attached to hot plate. At least the food will never be cold! Last time I ordered a la carte and tried the beef bulgogi; it tasted perfectly fine to me. All the extra fixins that usually come with a Korean meal (like kimchi and those glass noodles) are also all okay.There's not much in terms of ambiance here, and the TV will most likely be showing some random Korean TV show. However, this is a good spot to check out with friends, as most of the tables cater to groups. Since I don't eat a lot of Korean food, I don't have anything to compare it to, so for now it's just a-ok.",

The jeon was overcooked and greasy. We didn't try the dakgalbi that people seem to enjoy, but I'm guessing we probably wouldn't like it. The flavors are more local than Korean, which works well for the local clientele but it was not what we were looking for.",

    "text": "I dragged a group of friends to Big Mama's after reading a review on it on a famous food blog (maybe Lady Iron Chef) and had a very mediocre experience there. I can definitely say that this is not the best Korean food in Singapore, nor is it authentic (I have had a ton of Korean food in NY/LA). \u00a0It's good, but not fight the crowds, drool at the corner of your mouth good (not by a long shot).Make reservations on a weekend because it gets really crowded here full of large groups. \u00a0I guess most of these diners prefer home style Korean cooking, because there are fewer grilled options here. \u00a0The most popular dishes here are the soups, dak galbi (chicken with cabbage and rice cakes), and the sliced pork belly. \u00a0The pajun (pancake) was crispy and passable and the kimchee fried rice had nice bits of kimchee. \u00a0The dak galbi is the best dish of the dishes I've tried and while it had many more ingredients than traditional dak galbi, it is hearty and satisfying. \u00a0The sliced pork belly is ok and comes with different types of pickles. \u00a0The odd thing is that the waiter insisted on choosing our pork and sides and put it on our plates. \u00a0The panchan consisted of good kimchee, spinach, bean sprouts, potato salad, and a salted fish.The prices for the meat and portions can be a little high at S$25+, but it is within the range for typical Singaporean Korean food prices. \u00a0I'm craving Korean food, but likely will try a few more places before coming back here.

    "text": "Dakgalbi!! Spicy chicken, cabbage, rice cake, sweet potato matchsticks cooked in a bbq pan thing. I really wanted to try this since I didn't get a chance to while in Seoul. I would've liked it to be spicier, but my family liked it well enough. $15/pax, 2 person min. order. Highly recommend the option of adding $3/bowl of rice to be fried with the remaining 10% of the ingredients after you're mostly done eating the main dish (chicken etc). They add some seaweed/sesame oil (i bet, that's why it's so delicious)/pickles in the same pan and cook the rice with the remaining ingredients. SO good.. We only ordered one bowl of rice to be added and it was plenty! $18 grilled mackerel was delicious, very juicy. My brother says it was so good because it was fresh fish! Nice spicy/vinegarish dipping sauce to go with.Seafood pancake ($15) - AWESOME. Really crisp and thin, kind of like a pizza. Didn't have that much seafood though, that I could make out. Same dipping sauce as mackerel, also yummm.Side dishes - jap chae (korean vermicelli); kimchi; lotus root in some creamy sesame dressing (yum!); ikan bilis (expected it to be sweeter, this one was kind of salty - family loved it though!); spinach (just steamed or something); some sort of jelly in light chilli (yum too! very light)It was a little hard to get the attention of the servers, they were pretty busy running around. Reservations must be made for wkend! Good Korean food and for good prices :)",

    "text": "This is good Korean food for Singapore, this is as authentic as it can possibly get (so far). The reason im giving it a four is bc its the best ive had so far in singapore. If this were in LA or Korea, 2 or 3 at best. I had the jjambong and it was below average but the banchan (side dishes), pork, and tofu soup were good. But let me tell you, the portions are tiny. I know most SG people are rather skinny but the portion of pork (for $25) seemed like a rip off. I think its a strange concept for me on how expensive korean food is here bc it literally should have costed half of what we normally pay for. But, i cant complain. Im in a different country where the majority of people here arent korean so you gotta deliver to the masses. My hunt continues to find the best tasting jjambong here!",
