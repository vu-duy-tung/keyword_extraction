There is no AC, credit card machine, dressed-up waiters/kitchen staff, just great desi food.I got the lahori tandoor with a garlic naan (Total: $6). The chicken was mildly spiced and the garlic naan was hot and fresh. Finding seating may be difficult at times since this place is so popular with locals and the number of seats are limited by the outside space. FYI....be prepared to eat with your hands and wash them afterwards. This is how this type of food is meant to be eaten so don't complain about lack of utensils to the staff.",

    "text": "It is without a doubt that the naans here are great. I had the butter naan and at first glance, I was skeptical as I could see the naan dripping with the liquified butter. Not something I would order if I knew it was so high in the cholesterol. When I tore the naan apart, it peeled easily. The texture was soft in the inside but mildly crispy on the outside and it was actually much better than it looked. Even when consuming it without the curry. I also had the chicken masala to go with the naan. This curry was sweet and not spicy. The chicken in it fell off easily from the bone, which is exactly the way I like my meat - stewed for a long time and soft and light on the palette. The curry could have been a little spicier to give it a kick. The teh tarik here is just average and we ordered siu dai to preempt an often too generous dosage of the white matter from the drinks maker. I had a coffee to go too. First time having Indian coffee and I can only say that Indian coffee isn't something I'll ever order again.This place is cheap! You can get all the North Indian food you want - masala, chicken, mutton, naan (all types), fish, whatever here at an affordable price though I hope I haven't spoken too soon less they raise prices. Moderately crowded, all the seats were occupied at 8pm on a weekday night. Will definitely come back to try the other stuff!",

I kept eating anyways despite my tongue was burning more and more after each bite. But the best part of it was the cheese and garlic naan. Hands down or thumbs up or however you want to call it, best naan I've had...for now anyways until I visit India in the future.",

I've tried them all in Singapore and this is the undisputed king of kings. Packed to the gills at all hours...even past midnight into the wee hours of the morning.

(That's what they call themselves, despite the political connotations!)Geopolitics aside, this is THE place in Singapore to go to if you want fluffy, hot naans. Delicious, and always fresh off the tandoor -- always. They take their leavened breads very seriously. I've been coming here for years and I've never had a cold, stale one. Or one that wasn't delicious.It occupies an entire kopitiam unit at the junction of Serangoon and Desker Roads, so it's bustling, all the time. The staff are efficient, personable and funny; the drinks a touch too sweet, as any north Indian/Pakistani place would be. No night time adventure to nearby Mustafa Centre is complete without cheese naan, chicken kadai, dal fry, pepper fish, haleem and nihari (the latter two sell out early!). It's not quite restaurant-standard clean, but the food is; the surroundings may not be. But sometimes I think sitting in the back alley beside Usman, devouring desi khana, is my quintessential Singapore experience. Especially since they don't make this any better elsewhere in this country except in a private home.",

There are tables setup outside, inside you will find the food counter. If you are ordering To-Go you can order at the register, if you will be dining in move to the far end and place your order.There was one family in front of me, after they placed their order I placed mine, I ordered Chicken Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Briyani Rice, and Onion Naan. I also ordered two bottled waters. The gentleman taking the orders didn't write them down but he repeated mine and got it right. The drink coolers are to the right of the counter, go get whatever drink you ordered and bring it to your table.You can see one of the staff making your Naan to order. The food soon started arriving, everything was very enjoyable. Something else I liked was the price, probably the least expensive in the area.Your order has been written down and your cheque is waiting at the cash register. When you are ready to pay just go up to the order window and tell them you are ready to pay, you will be asked where you were setting, point to your table and they will know which cheque is yours.",

The chicken was tender, flavorful, and juicy. You can taste the turmeric and cumin in the biryani rice. Glad I opted for this rather than plain white rice. I ended up not getting any naan. There is a pitcher of water on each table. Seems like no one in Singapore drinks iced water. Thankfully I had a bottle of cold water w/ me because we came straight after work. Super delicious.

Waiting time is short too. Seen all patrons are satisfied with the food and servings portion is just nice too. Will definitely come back with friends.",

    "text": "Warning: 1. Come here if you like to eat with your hands. They don't like to let you use their cutlery. 2. If you sit outside, the stench from the drain may overpower the taste of your foodOk, so this grotty joint isn't the cleanest or the cutest place. It's on the corner of the notorious Desker road in little India. You'll get ambience alright. It's really quite a hoot sitting there and seeing/smelling the real world of Little India. Until your food arrives that is. You'll be blown away by the fluffy naans. Butter, garlic, or garlic and cheese or sesame naan, so many choices, too few carb calories to have. Then there is the palak paneer. Massive fan. Their version is dark green almost black. But omg with the cheese naan, you'll be having the most satisfying dinner/ supper yet. Washed down with a masala chai, you would then wonder why you haven't been here before. Simply good. I recommend taking a nap after a meal here. Bliss!",

    "text": "As everyone has said, they have one of the best naan in Singapore. Their Palak Paneer (made to order) is not creamy at all but very well made. The chickpea is like the one that you get in an authentic Indian or Pakistani dhaba.The best dish is the karahi chicken which is only made to order and takes close to 20 minutes as its prepared from scratch for every order. A must if you have the time or can do a take away as well.Should try their special chicken fried rice which is very flavourful with large amount of chicken, sauted onions, tomatoes and green chillies.Didn't bother trying any drinks as there is nothing out of the ordinary and are normal items.",

    "text": "The cheese naan is phenomenal. The mattar paneer was kinda lame, paneer was tough n flavorless. Felt overpriced at $9 or $10 for a small dish. Masala tea was ok, not very spicy n blander than I'd expect for an Indian place. The neighboring table got some kind of steaming vegetables that smelled awesome. \u00a0I would definitely come back for the naan, and want to try their cardamom lassi.",
