    "text": "The best hawker stall food in my entire trip is here at Jian Bo Shui Kueh. It's located to the left corner immediately as you enter the 2nd floor of Tiong Bahru. You can't miss it since there always seems to be a line there.The shui kueh doesn't look like much at first. It's just steamed rice cake topped with a pile of radish with seasoning. However, the topping is amazingly delicious. In fact, it was one of the only food I finished on the entire trip and went back for another order.Plenty of people also stop by to get it to go. I was tempted to take a 3rd order with me but had to refrain. If I'm ever in Singapore again, I would definitely be back to eat this.",

    "text": "I already had so much food but I couldn't leave Tiong Bahru without having tasted some shui kueh, which apparently here, is the best you can get in Singapore. And who told me that wasn't wrong: this has been by far, the best shui kueh (\"water cake\") I ever tried here in town. The history of Jian Bo Shui Kueh located in Tiong Bahru hawker centre apparently goes as far back as 1960. The shui kueh is topped with \"chye pooh\" (preserved radish) that is sweet and nutty at the same time. The cake results to be soft and smooth, and is well complemented with the chilli that doesn't overpower the whole taste, working very well with the salty and browned chye poh. A unique delicacy!",

The texture of the steamed rice cake is smooth and light. Topped over it is Chye Poh condiments, and this is the best part of the dish. This shop's chye poh differ from the rest in that you can taste the dried shrimp in it. The others does not add this stuff. That the main difference here.However, this condiment is too oily. You can see the excessive oil dripping down the shui kush and the pool of oil when you are done with it. Otherwise the review would been 5 stars.",

    "text": "There is, in my mind, no better Chwee Kueh than Jian Bo's. \u00a0 Chwee Kueh is a humble dish that given time and evolving tastes may fade from the Singaporean culinary scene and from the face of the earth. \u00a0Panic set in yet? \u00a0If you are the foodie that you say you are, your pulse should be racing and the vein in your temple pulsing right about now. \u00a0 \u00a0Well, ok, I may be overstating the case somewhat, and if the lines in front of Jian Bo are any indication, then Chwee Kueh is safe for now.Chwee Kueh is cakes made from rice flour and then steamed to creamy semi-firmness. \u00a0This simple cake is traditionally accompanied by two condiments, \"chye poh\" and a savory chili paste. \u00a0\"Chye poh\" is a salty, buttery, umami-laden concoction that has wondrous and magical powers on the human palate. \"Chye poh\" which actually refers specifically to one of the main ingredients of this condiment, preserved diced Chinese radish. \u00a0Although technically a condiment, the \"chye poh\" is in my humble opinion, the star. \u00a0Chwee Kueh lives or dies on the quality of the \"chye poh\". \u00a0Jian Bo's version is outstanding! \u00a0The diced preserved radish is stir-fried with sesame seeds and I suspect in sesame oil. \u00a0This elevates the two-dimensional saltiness of the pickled vegetable, giving it all kinds of interesting new flavor profiles with nutty, toasty and buttery notes. \u00a0Absolute genius. \u00a0I'm not the only one who thinks so, customers typically request extra servings of the condiment. The fine folks at Jian Bo are more than happy to accommodate cravings for their famous condiment. \u00a0At $3 for a small container, you'd be hurting from the gouging if this wasn't just simply phenomenal! \u00a0I usually just pony up because the \"chye poh\" will also elevate another quotidian standard, \"chye poh neng\" or \"chye poh\" omelette, although frittata is more technically appropriate. \u00a0The \"chili\" or \"hot sauce\" is the spice that wakes up the palate. \u00a0This is also good, but a certainly less famous member of the entourage, just like Johnny Drama, full of wannabe angst, with anger management issues. It's dried chilies stir-fried with dried shrimps...what's not to like?? \u00a0The ratios of condiments with each cake are hotly debated and a matter of personal preference and orientation. \u00a0At the end of the day, you find what you like, make your peace and keep your mouth shut about whether you think this is better than your cousin's mix. \u00a0It's not as contentious as Jameson versus Bushmills, but it's pretty close.At the end of the day, it's all about visiting a Singapore landmark, Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre, ordering up 10 of these lovely creamy rice cakes for less than $4 (at the time of this writing), and enjoying each cake doused with a heaping helping of the aforementioned \"condiments\" and letting the lied of legacy flavors play soothingly in your head. \u00a0And may I make so bold as to suggest an intermission of a sip of local milk tea and then letting that music continue to play to an audience of one.Of course, there's also Hai San and Tiong Bahru Fried Kway Teow in the house, so remember to leave enough room for a whole orchestra of flavors to flood your head.",

Served with finely diced cai pok (preserved radish) and satisfyingly spicy chilli, this was one of the only foods my grandmother would indulge in without any inhibition, and she was very picky about her food especially when cancer robbed her of her appetite.But when I bought her Jian bo chwee kueh and ate with her in front of the TV, it was one of our happier moments when I realised I finally found something delicious enough to make her feel like eating again.Jian bo chwee kueh stands out, not only because of its fast factory-precision serving line that Ford would be proud of, so long lines move quickly and everyone has a chance at getting their guilty pleasure for only $1.20 (4 pieces). The rice cakes are soft and moist, and the cai pok is fragrant, fried with sesame and dried shrimps. It has all the right bits for perfection.I never eat chwee kueh from any other stalls since I found Jian bo, because that would be like cheating, with an uglier person.",

It's best to avoid this place on Sunday mornings, people from all over the country flock here to have Sunday lunch and as a result, queues are long and seating is sparse.

This stall has been around for a long time, I remember visting this stall at the old tiong bahru market when I was a child. It was already very popular since then! The dish is basically rice cakes served with Chai po (turnip meticulously chopped, prepared and fried), and eaten with chilli on the side. It's served on a brown paper (very old school). There's more than one stall in Tiong bahru market that serves this dish so be sure to check the unit number!
