    "text": "The passion of several entrepreneurs, who has worked in various sectors including F&B, advertising, hotels and even in fitness lead to the formation of an industrial-chic cafe called My Awesome Cafe. Most of them, including the owner Franck Hardy, has brought their expertise in working in restaurants, caf\u00e9s and hotels over (and yes some even worked in Michelin-star restaurants / caf\u00e9s before!).Located below the creative agency Mangham Gaxiola, it occupies the what previously is Chung Hwa Free Clinic and specializes in all-day breakfast, salads, sandwiches, coffees, teas, beers and liquor. They are also the only place in Singapore to sell Mexican Coca-Cola for the long term (read: Coca-Cola with Cane Sugar! The first being Omakase Burger but was only available for a limited time)The food menu is rather diverse!And the drinks menu! (they have Mexican Coca-Cola here!)The Croissant with Scrambled Eggs and Smoked Salmon ($8++) is easily one of the better tasting breakfast food out there. The croissant is filled with strips of cheese and the smoked salmon, which was smoked to the right texture and taste. The scrambled eggs, however, tasted slightly more like an omelette instead but still maintains its moist texture.The coffee served here are blends made from Columbian, Brazilian and Sumatran beans. The Latte ($4.50++) is full bodied and maintains the strong taste of the roasting process. Anyone who does not like bitterness may not like this even as the right amount of milk is added into the coffee.In overall, this place will surely attract the crowds with their passion and patriotism to the food and service served here. If you are around the CBD / Tanjong Pagar / Telok Ayer area, why not pop by this place? I know I would, and will try the Mexican Coca-Cola the next time round!",

    "text": "I like this place. It definitely has its kinks to be worked out - every single [3] visit something on mine or my friends' orders has been wrong. But when pointed out the issue is always quickly resolved. People make mistakes - it's all in how you handle them, I say. The salads are great for lunch or a light dinner, though on the pricey side ($15++, addt'l $3 for cheese on the My Awesome Salad making it $18++). Still tasty enough for me to order the salad on every visit, I just can't make this a regular weekly stop for lunch.The happy hour specials are good for the CBD in my opinion (somewhere ~$35 for a bottle of wine, if memory serves, and something for beer and bubbly too). I wish you didn't have to queue up by the kitchen in order to pay at the end, as I feel massively in the way of the staff running back and forth with dishes of food which I could knock into. Not sure I can think of a more efficient process given the layout (and it does cut down on the time to pay as there's no need to flag down a server to get your bill) - just something for the cafe to consider.",

Same experience as prior reviewer that the proprietor does a good job but the other waiters were a disaster.

The meal had a very light European feel to it. I had the ham sandwich which was served open face on baguette with a piece of very good ham on each slice of bread. The side salad was very nice and the yogurt & granola with pin alp slices seemed odd, but really was a nice side / ending to the meal. I had a great cup of tea as well.If I would have realized how close I was to Chinatown, I might have passed this place up for some cheaper fare, but I'm glad that I didn't.",

Their menu is ridiculously complicated, it's almost as if you'd have to solve a puzzle to get a meal, but not even a fun one because the food was terrible. My friend got a cold salad instead of the sandwich form he asked for. When he asked the waiter to change it, their suggestion was to put the salad inside some bread and call it a day! My acai icecream tasted like dirt. The beer was ok but I had better. What was worse, when we asked for the manager, he came and didn't even know what was in the menu.

Everything no the plate was perfect and just the way I like them to be, very very fresh. \u00a0Oh and you get to top it with a few pieces of brie or goat cheese. The pesto on the slice of bread that came with the salad was also super yummy! \u00a0We also ordered the acai, healthy super food dessert alternative, it's basically acai berries beaten and blended into a sorbet like texture, refreshing and delicious. \u00a0The price is not cheap but is completely justifiable by the high quality of the ingredients. I will definitely go back to check out their other offerings like their sandwiches and shakes. \u00a0The place gets filled up pretty quickly during lunch time so get there early. \u00a0Some nice outdoor roadside seats where u can enjoy your food while people watching. The decor is pretty interesting too as it occupies the former site of the Chung Hwa Clinic and they have retained the sign. \u00a0Inside the vibe is undoubtedly industrial. \u00a0Although it actually makes the places looks less genuine (thanks to all the fake heritage stuff around the shophouse area) and lowered my expectations for the food. But i guess don't judge a book by its cover?",

Upon closer inspection, it is anything but. Expertly placed assorted knick-knacks and lit with rainbow-coloured lantern lamps, My Awesome Caf\u00e9's eclectic factor ranks high.Food-wise, the Chicken Lasagna didn't quite hit the spot as the portion was a tad too small. Try the Organic Watermelon Juice for a refreshing drink or the Awesome Coconut Ice Cream - great for cooling down in Singapore's hot weather.Choose from a couple of square tables or opt for a high table-top to do your work. Almost every table has a power socket close by and their Wi-Fi signal is pretty strong. Our planned 2 hour stint turned into a 5 hour affair! It can get pretty quiet on a Sunday night, given that the surrounding areas are office buildings, but hey we are not complaining! A great spot for work or for a chill night out with buddies.",

It wasn't very busy, maybe 50% full. Took forever to order, they forgot to bring out entire our order and brought the bill before complete meal was brought to us. The server dropped food off at the table and bolted, couldn't ask her for anything. Such a bummer because it is a cute spot.",

    "text": "Very much a regular here for a couple of reasonsFirstly the service is excellent, no matter how busy the guys/girls are there to helpSecondly the bottles of wine and platters are great value for an evening of good conversation, great atmosphere, great quality and great price.Vodka Cocktails as the night kicks on are wicked. Lunches are good too but I do find them a touch on the higher side for good value. Still excellent quality but a not as good a value which is the only reason I am deducting half a star. 4.5 stars - highly recommend",

    "text": "Came here on a Monday night, and this place was bathed in red light, from the red lanterns on top. Felt like I was in a bad Hong Kong movie circa 1980s. So, the food. I didn't have any drinks 'cept water here. I had an Awesome vegetarian salad, which wasn't super awesome in terms of taste, but awesome in terms of size. It was HUGE! On a bed of mesclun greens, was half an avocado, a boiled egg, some grilled eggplant (which they substituted my hated bell peppers out with), tomatoes, and brie cheese. I found the salad impossible to eat alone, and my companion had to help me out. The salad was also bathed in a very oily dressing, which I quickly tired of.After my very huge salad, I wanted something sweet, so bread and butter pudding it was. Nothing to shout about, 3/5. I did like the ambience here, with the remodelled school desks, retro yet industrial feel, but the red lights.have.got.to.stop.",

The owner Franck cane around checked on us and treated us to a complimentary piece of cake as a treat. They have free wifi so I finished some work over an iced Latte. It doesn't get much better,I will be back weekly!",

My two previous visits were two to forget, but the place is outside my front door and one of few in the neighbourhood open on Sundays; out of convenience Ihad to give it one more try. Service was prompt and the food was good. \u00a0The ambiance is excellent and the popularity of the place, \u00a0and the fact that it was in a startup phase, \u00a0might have something to do with my previous poor experiences of the place. The proprietor seems to have managed to get a stable and properly trained staff. \u00a0I'll be back again.",

    "text": "Had walked past this place a few times and read about it online but had never had the chance to visit. Actually, my first thought when I heard about this place was \"what a corny name for a cafe\". The Chinese name is a literal translation, which doesn't really help... But maybe they are trying to be ironic in a hipster way that I'll never understand? But corny name aside, the food was good, so I shan't harp on it.We had the My Awesome Salad and the Parma Ham Sandwich (with brie added on). I loved the sandwich, the bread was soft and warm, yet crispy on the sides. They were generous with their ingredients and it was very tasty. Same for the salad, it came with a large serving of smoked salmon, roasted chicken and tuna mayonnaise. My only gripe was that the avocado was a bit raw. We were here after spin class down the road so it was a good thing that their food portions were huge- we were starving! It was a good deal and really unexpected as each dish is only about $15-20 on average.Decor is... Interesting. Red paper lanterns galore, high stools made of pipes, desks turned into dining tables. The air conditioning (either that or the very powerful fans) was adequate, but just barely. SUMMARY: quirky decor, very good bread, portions are huge for the price ($15-20). Would visit again!",
