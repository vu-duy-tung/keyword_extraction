I quite liked the fried yam on the special menu.The normal is excellent as well. You can't go wrong with staples such as Xiao Long Bao. You can even have xiao long bao with truffles if you feel like being fancy. I also like the chili crab bao, as well as all the dumplings here. The fried rice and fried vegetables are good too, I am a huge fan of the dou miao. This location is pretty big. There is usually a wait but the lines move quickly.If you have never been to Din Tai Fung, you are missing out!",

It has a number of branches in Singapore with Paragon outlet as the flagship outlet in Singapore. The outlet was also one of the largest in Singapore with a private dining room. I reached the outlet just before it opened for business and could spot about 10 people waiting outside the restaurant. I was swiftly showed to a table. The staff also kindly provided me with a bag basket to put my handbag, plus a cloth to cover it. Hot tea was served without asked, and was chargeable at $1++.Steamed Custard Bun \u6d41\u6c99\u5305 ($2++)The bun was served pipping hot. The skin was thin and smooth with its filling flowing out easily like lava.Steamed Assorted Bun Infused with Truffle Oil \u83cc\u83c7\u5927\u5305 ($2++)Similar to the Steamed Custard Bun, the skin was thin. It was nicely smelled of truffle oil. The chopped mushroom filling was juicy and flavourful.Deep-fried Handmade Tofu with Water Chestnuts & Mushrooms \u9165\u70b8\u7d20\u8c46\u8150 ($8.60++)Served with sweet chilli sauce.The tofu was quite crispy on the outside. Inside it was soft and different from the usual tofu. It was packed with shredded black fungus, shiitake mushrooms and water chestnuts. The black fungus and water chestnuts gave the tofu a unique crunchy texture. The mushrooms gave a earthy taste to the simple looking tofu.Steamed Layered Red Date Cakes \u67a3\u6ce5\u7cd5 ($4.80++ / 2 pieces)The simple looking cake had a kueh kueh texture, being sticky and chewy. It had a kind of unique sweetness.Overall the food was not bad. The tea was refilled often. Although it was just 11am, queue was already formed outside the restaurant.",

Din Tai Fung is very famous for their steamed pork dumplings or xiao long baos. Awarded one Michelin star and ranked as one of world's Top 10 Best Restaurants by The New York Times, the signature dumplings at Din Tai Fung consists of really juicy meat and melt in your mouth skin. Oh and each dumpling includes at least 18 folds. I have tried many such steamed pork dumplings in many restaurants and no one does it as well as Din Tai Fung.  Of cos Din Tai Fung (DTF) was also featured in Anthony Bourdain's show \"Layover with Anthony Bourdain- Taipei\".  Today I have also tried the Steamed Chicken Soup. It was light yet savory. The soup was supposedly simmered for a period of 6 hours to attain perfection. I have ordered many other dishes at DTF over the years but they did not leave much impression. So I would definitely stick to the steamed pork dumplings DTF is famous for and maybe the soup next time.",

OUR EXPERIENCE:- Our 2 local friends treated my wife and me to a very nice Xiao Long Bao feast here on a Wed afternoon! As expected, there was a long waiting line. But, the restaurant managed the line nicely and orderly. The area outside of the restaurant was quite pleasant and it was nice to see the kitchen staff in action through the large glass windows, while waiting anyway. \u00a0It took us less than 20min wait to get our table. The dining area is more spacious than I thought, with a neat and comfortable setting. We had 5 orders of Xiao Long Baos (- 3 \u00a0with pork/truffle filling; 1 with Crabmeat; 1 with Vegie filling); plus 2 side fishes. Total ~S$80; all scrumptious! \u00a0The service was excellent: - Our orders were brought out piping hot; tea cups and water glasses kept full throughout; empty dishes promptly cleared away; wait staff pleasant and helpful.My wife and I like the setting and service in this branch better than those in Taipei and Los Angeles. The quality and variety of dishes are typical of Din Tai Fong fame, however. After such a fabulous experience, our friends then told us that there were 7+ DTF branches in Singapore!

Even though not all the tables were taken up, we still had to wait for about 5 minutes. 2 groups of diners were ahead of us. Service was good. We were warned the xlb and other dishes would be about 10-15 minutes wait, and only the \"xiao cai\" would be served immediately. But the xlb came within 10 minutes. I like that. Warn the customers and then serve the food earlier than expected, making it a good experience. Our tea was topped up very often without us having to ask. It had been quite some time (probably a couple of years or longer) since I last dined at the Paragon outlet and it had expanded since then. There were more tables available and I guessed people do get seated quickly despite the perennial long lines during dinner time. That was always daunting and explained why I hardly dined there. The xlb was still as good. Thin skin with a flavorful soup, enough to fill my spoon, and yummy meat. The fried rice was not as good as remembered though. It used to be really fragrant and just made you want more. Today's version was a bit wet, the rice stuck together and was quite a disappointment. The dumplings in vinegar and chili oil were average, mainly due to the thicker skin, so they were more chewy. I would say focus on the xlb and xiao cai, the others would be quite secondary.",

Complained to the manager, but he just stood there and said \"ok\" then left and never came back. Came here with a high expectation but disappointed in every possible way",

    "text": "A friend and I met with our children at Din Tai Fung tonight. \u00a0We were seated rather quickly considering the crowd. We ordered a lot of dumplings, spinach, and dates. Our food was delivered timely and it was delicious. There is lots of room for improvement in the service department at Din Tai Fung. My friend and I ordered a bottle of wine to split. The waitress brought us the bottle and two glasses and just set it on the table and left. Fortunately it was a screw cap so we could manage to pour our glasses ourselves, but needless to say that is a training issue. We also had to ask for water six times. Yes, you read that correctly, SIX times. Our children were thirsty, we wanted water and we asked for it six times. It was finally brought to our table. The food is very tasty, but the service is lacking.",
