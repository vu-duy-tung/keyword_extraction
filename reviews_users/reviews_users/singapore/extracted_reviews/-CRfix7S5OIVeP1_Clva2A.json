A little secret in the dinning community.Lots of Pratas (Indian pancake) with unconventional fillings. Delicious. Wide variety of drinks, sorry no alcohol. Pratas were just right. Not to hard or soft. I had the Mutabuger, a Mutabak with a meat filling all wrap up. I also had a Prata with chili. There are other fillings too. They too had Nasi Branyni, an Indian rice dish. I did not try that because I am staying away from rice. Will definitely patronize it again.",

    "text": "Found a feather in the murtabak.Told the waitress.She looked at the feather and told me to wait.She told the manager or the Chef (the guy behind the glass).They looked our direction then carried on with business.The dosai was good though.The murtabak was ok but the ground chicken was bland (and feathery (-_-)). The curry with the murtabak is really watery and flavourless.The chicken masala was ok.The coffee and tea is good. It's good to get a big cup of coffee.So overall, the place is ok, probably below average. There are much better places around for sure.I'd give two or three stars for an average place but since the service is so bad and the chicken isn't cleaned properly or the Chef doesn't look at the food he is cooking I have to give a one star.",

Can't get any better than that!It was my maiden voyage to Springleaf, and though it was tempting to try some of their crazy prata concoctions I stayed true to my principles and stuck with their plain prata. (To assess the greatness of a prata place, I truly believe you gotta see how they do their plain before all else!)Their plain prata is not greasy, rather it's crispy and thick. Fish curry was good too, not too spicy which is the way I like it.Can't wait to return and try something more adventurous!",

    "text": "This shop name is quite a familiar name among local singaporean prata lovers. I used to frequent the first outlet they have at upper thomson road / Sembawang rd when I used to live in Yishun and had a car! This outlet im reviewing however, is the outlet in the east of Singapore near Siglap, Jln Tua Kong.To say that a place sells good prata, it really depends on their prata kosong (plain prata) and not their other fancy schmancy pratas you get these days - \u00a0and this place sells a very good prata kosong. Crispy but chewy with every bite, and not just soaked in oil.Since I already love their normal kosong prata here, today I came for their novelty pratas which I believe have made some headlines for all the right reasons over the previous year - The Plaster Blaster + MurtaBurger!The plaster blaster is a prata version of an egg's benedict and the Murtaburger is actually a murtabak but with ramly burger beef patties inside as a filling! Both very sinful but good! Definitely not for the health conscious but you can definitely consider this a \"cheat day\" for me!The place can get a bit on the noisy side, don't say i didnt warn you! :P3.8 Stars",

    "text": "This place came highly recommended by my mum, a very trusted food guru in my family, but I was quite unfortunately disappointed by it. I eat Prata very often...I'd say much more often than I should for my health. The three stars that I'm giving is almost purely for ambience and novelty: the air-con, above average prata place cleanliness and the extensive menu (portobello mushrooms on Prata?). However, a nicer place means nicer prices, so expect the food to be a little more expensive than your average prata house. For the higher price, the Prata is no crispier than the place we frequent at Simpang, nor is the curry better. In fact, the curry's the worst out of every place I've been to, even the generic Prata stall in the Coffeeshop near my house. It is so bland that we always order a separate curry (masala chicken $7) to go with our Prata instead. It puzzles me why we would go to the extent of doing that, but half the family likes the place so that's that. If you live in the area, are feeling adventurous and need a quick hygienic snack, feel free to check out this place and get the fish curry instead if you can. One raved about prata is their mozzarella and portobello option, though I've personally never tried it. If you're just looking for a good simple crispy plain prata and don't mind coffeeshops, do look elsewhere.",
