The wine list was extensive and, at the same time, downright ludicrous. \u00a0The lamb with mint sauce was cooked to perfection. \u00a0Ahi tartare was executed properly enough. \u00a0I don't know if this is where I would recommend someone to go in Singapore for a nice meal, but it did the trick. \u00a0They could do without the creepy framed pics of celebrities on the walls. \u00a0We spent several minutes trying to identify Katy Perry. \u00a0She looks like Zooey Deschanel, and I was thinking Marion Cotillard...",

Everything from the little cheese poppers (in lieu of bread), right down to the impeccable service, this place is a dream to dine at! Try the lobsters! It is surprisingly delish. They also slice up the lobsters with deft, orchestrated simultaneous strokes. Dessert is also a do. Yum yum yum!!!",

We started with the appetizer of bone marrow flan, it was creamy and flavorful and please do share it. No one should eat this entire dish alone. We also shared the steak tartare which was also fantastic but the serving was good for two. So two appetizers for two pax was too much. We ordered the US Wagyu Ribeye and the seasoning, texture, and doneness were perfect. I was blown away. I tried the different sauces they provided which were good but I prefer it without any sauces. We thought of ordering a side dish but wanted to save space for dessert.For dessert, we shared the souffle and it was the perfect exclamation point to a delicious dinner!",

Besides that, the souffle and the creamed spinach is a must-have when you're there.Regarding the ambiance, I find that the dining area is rather dark and probably due to how the restaurant is layout, the noise/sound bounces off the wall which kinda make the place really noisy/loud when people start chitter-chattering the night away (which make it hard to carry conversation properly). However, the bar area is just perfect. To be honest, I rather be sitting at the bar area to have my dinner than the dining area.(Nonetheless, I can't wait to head back there for rounds of G&T already.)",

    "text": "Awesomeness !! This review is overdue and I finally found time to write it.I visited the other CUT locations as well and am a regular here at CUT Singapore, in particular the one in Beverly Hills. I found the whole setup and service here in Singapore much warmer and more pleasant with better service as well. If you are used to cold shoulder service, think again and visit CUT!The seating was nice and a short notice table was not a problem though not sure that is because my name popped up in their computer. The staff was and is always polite, professional and naturally friendly. A 5* experience. Note that it is a pricey experience as well though, think 350-400$ for a two person meal. But worth it!!!You will be presented with the various options of meat and the server explains to you what the specifics of the meat are.I personally like the 'Bone in Filet Mignon' medium rare paired with a nice red wine. This time we chose an Argentinian Malbec, a pleasure to drink. Note that I'm not even pretending to be a wine expert at all - I just like to drink what tastes well (to me) and so far Argentinian wines did not disappoint me in any way. The young lady who presented the wine was super friendly as always.The steak came, together with the sides which this time consisted of mushrooms and spinach.The highlight ladies and gentlemen is the dessert. Have the chocolate souffle and you with either foodgasm or die and go to heaven (or a combination of both) right at the table.So if you are looking for your perfect dining experience, come here and you won't regret it!Enjoy ~S.",

I got the USDA New York sirloin with Argentinean Chimichurri sauce, potato puree, and creamed spinach. The sides were exactly what I expected. No surprises there, but archetypes of a high-end steak restaurant. The steak was what surprised me. Perfectly medium-rare, tender, with a smoky, crispy sear. I felt like I was in Chicago. Sure $88++ is not cheap for a 12oz. steak, but considering the market, it's a good deal. I've had some terrible steaks for not a lot less.",

    "text": "CUT holds up with the best steakhouses I've been to in the USA, Australia, and Europe. We started our meal with the bone marrow flan. It was fantastic - it was rich and buttery. The garnish went perfectly with the marrow on top of a nice piece of toast. I was impressed. Additionally, the complimentary selection of breads, rolls, and breadsticks were all pretty impressive - it's hard not to fill up on them, but you should resist.For our main, I split the porterhouse for two. Not cheap ($178 if I recall), but between two it's actually one of the cheaper menu options. They carve the steak table side, which is a nice touch, and it is served with an assortment of complimentary sauces and mustards. The flavor of the steak itself was fantastic and exactly what you would expect from dry aged meat. The steak had a fantastic crust and flavor from the garnish of thyme, butter, and garlic. The meat was amazingly tender and nearly collapsed with each bite.For sides we had the onion rings and broccolini. Both were delicious and perfect accompaniments for a steak dinner. However, they obviously were not the most memorable parts of the meal.Service was truly fantastic here. Any request or order we had was met almost immediately. Even our order of onion rings came out a little late (maybe 5-10 minutes after the rest of our order) and they gave it to us on the house. Overall the meal was pricey, but by comparison to other restaurants in Singapore and taking into account the quality of the food and service, I didn't feel overcharged.",

    "text": "My brother warned me into coming to this restaurant. He went CUT in LA before and he said it was an underwhelming experience. The steaks were too 'modern' and even a bit pretentious. But I still want to try a modern steak house, and I haven't been to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant before so curiosity got the best of me.The appetizers were alright. I've tried the oysters, pork belly, warm veal tongue, and they were all very decent.But the steak that I ordered was an extremely huge letdown. I've tried and fell in love with Snake River Farms beef before when I was in the US. Theoretically, what the breeder seek to accomplish is marry that wonderful beefiness of American beef, with the luxurious marbling of Japanese beef.I was ecstatic when I discovered that they were gonna serve that beef in CUT Singapore. Even before flying off to Singapore, I already knew what I was gonna have for my steak.My favorite cut of the meat is the rib eye, particularly because of that fat, decadent layer up top known as the rib cap. When my Snake River Farms rib eye came, I was shocked with horror. It came WITHOUT the rib cap. I thought I was just unlucky, and during my 2nd visit, I ordered the same thing, only to face the same nightmare for the second time. -_-The rib eye itself was not that good too. It was too dry, and too chewy and was a great injustice to a Snake River Farms beef.I don't think I'll be back to CUT ever again. There are many better steak houses in Singapore and I'd rather go to Ruth Chris' or even Morton's instead.",

I have an incorrigible sweet tooth, and it aches for this behemoth of a chocolate souffle. their other desserts are pretty much up there with the best I've had locally, but it's the souffle that shines - there's some magic in the substantial lightness, and all the textures and temperatures in it. I could wax lyrical all day (and I've done it once before), but really, just look at it - chocolate sauce dribbling down the side while creme fraiche and ice cream sink their slow way into that airy nest of chocolate.but you've heard me say all this before - so I'll try to spare you further expostulation. suffice to say that the standard's consistent, the chocolate deep and satisfying - well worth any gym-rat behavior. we also managed two other desserts this time - a deconstructed banana cream pie of creme brulee, chocolate pearls and a caramel banana ice cream; and a chocolate hazelnut marjolaine cake with caramel popcorn and salted popcorn ice cream.both were pretty good - and I especially liked the the chocolate-hazelnut slice (though I might be biased as a newtella addict), though the accompanying popcorn seemed a little staleish. small detail though - we lapped everything up. the place is dark and intimate, service friendly and efficient - and really, the prices aren't low but I'm more than happy to spend it here for the quality and portions. most definitely my favorite place here. ----------------------------------------------old review:utterly fantastic and wholly incomparable bliss-out desserts at this famed steakhouse in marina bay sands. I have unashamedly fallen in deep mire with this place - it's now my go-to for indulging in sweets, and I'm afraid that it might just become an uncontrollable habit.I've wanted to come here for a long time - and while I'm bursting with adjectives, let me objectively say that the souffle was high, fluffy, barely deflated even after standing, and when eaten with the chocolate ice cream and creme fraiche on top - was a revelation in deep dark chocolate and that gorgeous play of hot and cold. truly, this ranks as one of the best mouthfuls I've ever had.",

    "text": "5-star food at 5-star pricesSingaporeans are passionate about their steaks. It's not uncommon to find $100 steaks on the menus of many high-end restaurants. At Cut though, the prices go significantly higher when you throw in the tempting array of appetisers, sides and mains - which are done well, if you need to justify the bill. A hearty dinner for two with wine will reach past $500 easily.When you're mulling over the menu, the waiter will trundle over a meat trolley filled with American cuts in white napkins and Japanese cuts in black. The service is absolutely impressive - if you are familiar with Morton's you'll know what I mean.For wagyu lovers and first timers, I highly recommend the Tasting of New York Sirloin - it includes Kobe style from Snake River Farm (120g), USDA Prime corn-fed (120g), and Japanese wagyu from Shiga (60g). As you can guess, these are pretty tender and marbled choices, so if you prefer something more robust, try the Angus ribeye or such. It's a real meat market here with just about something to suit everyone. Wolfgang Puck pops by to Singapore about once a year. so don't expect to see the man himself - instead, he's got a whole crew of stellar managers and chefs from the US to oversee this jumpin' joint. The music's rather loud but we're told it's the way they like it in the States.",

    "text": "Being a vegetarian, I will admit that I have only ever been to the lounge area at CUT. But I feel no shame in reviewing the place despite my clearly \"incomplete\" experience, because it is just that good.What can I tell you about the cocktails here? I don't want to recommend a specific one... I'm sure your tastes differ from mine. But I will say that they are all intricately prepared and most of them will blow your mind. Should I talk about the Rough Love, a combination of gin, umeshu and champagne, is served in a large wine glass, with a giant cube of ice. A single raspberry sits atop that ice cube, and remains there until you finish your drink. The drink looks like an expensive pink diamond ring. A delicate balancing act, both taste wise and architecturally. Or should I tell you about the time my hubby asked them to make a penicillin, and I sneaked a peek of the bartender pouring Domaine de Canton in the drink? \"It's not going to be the same..\" I muttered under my breath, disgruntled. It wasn't... but it was amazing. Or should I mention that they barrel age some of their cocktails? The negroni that I ended up with was softened and rounded off having spent some time in the cask, and it tasted timeless. I guess I could go on and on. The main reason to recommend the lounge at CUT is the fact that their bartenders are great artists, and they have a great passion for the art of making good cocktails. And if you ever do go, don't forget to order a portion of the butterscotch apple dessert -- it's the bomb.Singapore has many cocktail bars, but a few great ones. I count the bar at CUT and the one at Tippling club as the only ones to understand truly what it is like to create a balanced cocktail, time and time again.",

    "text": "One-star Michelin steakhouse in MBS. Expensive high quality steak. Had the trio of beef to sample different cuts - New York Sirloin, Wagyu, and USDA Prime. Both the NY sirloin and the USDA prime were top-notch but the Wagyu was a let-down. Definitely had better wagyu beef elsewhere...Portions are small, especially when considering the price. So overall the steak alone would be 4 star.Starters are amazing - we ordered the saut\u00e9ed mushroom and patatas bravas - definitely one of the best starters I have had in a whileIf you don't eat beef, the pork chop is excellent - juicy and tender with a very good complementary sauce. Large wine selection but unfortunately sommelier wasn't the most helpful. We asked for a red wine recommendation and he basically pointed to so many that it misses the point of being a recommendationService was really slow and not attentive / definitely not what we would expect from this type of restaurant. Mediocre service counters the 5-star starters to give a 4* rating.",

He now ranks amongst the best chefs/restaurateurs in the world, and \"Spago\" in LA is an institution that has found worldwide fame, now present in many locations, Singapore included. Another venture of his is CUT, focusing on steak. We booked there for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed it tremendously.As there are many other reviews raving about this place I'm trying to keep it short, hoping to contribute to a coherent picture.Service is very friendly, efficient, and, which I always find refreshing at \"celebrity restaurants\", authentic. No snobbishness, just smiles all around, staff greeting repeat customers with true joy of seeing each other again. A rare trait at this kind of place.Interior is modern/elegant, darkish, with great lighting, and the wonderful celebrity portrait photography by Martin Schoeller featured in the entire location and on menus.Food is delicious- I won't go into detail, we had crab/shrimp cocktail starters, steak and dessert - and it arrives pretty fast, which we did not expect with the restaurant being very busy.The wine list features a great many choices and we really enjoyed our Pinot Noir from California. Prices for wine are on the steep side, but I guess this isn't news to anyone in Singapore..I really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics (e.g. David Bowie) and contemporary (e.g. Coldplay) - a daring choice but a good change from \"the usual\". Toilets are very sleek and very clean, and so big!I cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall, which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting Gucci post-dinner.. (didn't work for me but one can always try ;-))",

I ordered a nice glass of red wine with help from their sommelier. I also got the ribeye and the potatoes. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, medium rare. And it was a nice cut. Those potatoes were fabulous! Roasted, smashed, then crisped and garnished with lots of savory onions! For dessert, I splurged and got the chocolate souffl\u00e9. Oh. My. Goodness. This is literally in my top 3 desserts. Ever. It was just pure delight and not too chocolatey. When the souffl\u00e9 arrived, the waiter topped it with melted chocolate, a dollop of whip cream, and then topped it with more chocolate. Gah! I also got a glass of sweet red wine, which was a nice accompaniment to the souffl\u00e9. I'm drooling now as I think of that delicious meal! Enjoy! Oh! And I almost forgot! They gave me a long stem red rose and a box of homemade chocolates. They were fabulous! I didn't see them give them to the guys at the table next to me so thanks for making my day!",

    "text": "I recommend making reservations because as a walk-in, they are most likely going to seat you in the lounge where shoppers gawk at you through the window as they walk by. Not a great ambiance, all things considered. The steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it. I wouldn't order it again, truthfully. The menu is pretty straightforward. I wanted the porterhouse so Jerry and I ordered the portion for 2. Little did we know it's 1 piece cooked and divided in half. I wanted rare and he wanted medium-rare. It was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it. They then walked over to Jerry to confirm his medium-rare wishes so they can continue to cook it. I got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items. I forgot what it was but I remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste, presentation, and quality of the food. The bone marrow was tender. It melted in my mouth. It was so rich, I felt guilty as I was eating it but it was too good to stop. I wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though. The porterhouse was tender. Their house made steak sauce was delicious. The steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so I kept adding. Finally time for desserts. I was the only one that wanted desserts. I ordered the chocolate souffl\u00e9. Knew that it would take at least 15 minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out. The portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but I don't share when it comes to food so I enjoyed it, orgasmiscally until it was all gone. Their crime fraiche was thick and creamy, the chocolate sauce was rich, the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w/ the huge, decadent, and delicious chocolate souffl\u00e9. Service was impeccable. 10% off for MasterCard users. Thanks for allowing us to expense this!!! Love my company.",

I've even frequented CUT restaurants in other locations including Los Angeles and Dubai. But for some reason, the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best CUT but also one of the best restaurants in Singapore.What also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection. Their cocktails definitely among the best in Singapore - fresh ingredients and creative \"mixology\" similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff (the only ones I've found in SG so far that can even compare to the creations here are Bar Stories on Arab St. and Nutmeg and Clove on Club St.). You can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy - my favorite is Duke of Earl - a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin. Also love their \"spiked\" Thai Iced tea. :)Anyways for the food, their Kobe beef is unreal. Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of their steaks.Lastly, their dessert. They also have the best dessert I've ever had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Baked Alaska which has kaya ice cream inside. UNREAL!!!!!!!!!! Make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons - drinks, steaks, dessert. Every person I've brought here ends up loving it as much as I do and for good cause. You won't be disappointed. :)",

And orgasmic. How they made carrots, Mac & cheese, mini Kobe burgers, fish tacos, & potatoes (all separate dishes) taste like culinary heaven is beyond me. The bartender and servers were courteous & lively which definitely amped up the atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.",

Ordered the U.S. filet mignon, UK ribeye, Hokkaido scallop carpaccio, creamed spinach, & wild mushrooms. The cook on the filet mignon was great! The portions were just right for my boyfriend and I. Though we were stuffed at the end of the meal, we couldn't help but try their desserts. The kaya baked Alaska was to die for! It wasn't too sweet, so it was perfect !!Also had the sweet wine & port.",

    "text": "I really don't have much negatives to say about this place despite it being twice as more expensive than the LA version, which usually annoys me. \u00a0From what I recall, they had some kind of discounts if you make it before the happy hour ends. We came here for our anniversary dinner few months back, and the service, atmosphere, and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration. I am a bone marrow fan and it didn't disappoint, unlike the one in Osteria Mozza across the street (though I'm also a long-time fan of that restaurant). It was juicy, flavorful, and exactly messy and authentic as the ones I'd eat in New York. \u00a0D usually gets the RIb Eye, and I get the Filet Mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish, and both were on point. \u00a0On the side, caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair. Overall, a place to go in Singapore when you're missing some good quality meat in your life!",

ExcellentThen we had the steak that was shared. \u00a0Heaven Wine was ok , on the expensive side. \u00a0They won't allowed us to bring our own ! \u00a0A bit of a downer We finished with sweet port n chocolate souffl\u00e9. A highly recommended place if u are willing to spend at least $200+ per person.",

    "text": "CUT is on the playing field with the top tier of steakhouses in the world, offering top cuts of beef imported from the leading beef nations including waygu beef from Japan.The menu and the atmosphere were certainly more of what I would expect in a West Coast or Las Vegas steakhouse (no surprise)--contemporary, minimalist furnishing and decor. \u00a0Small plates with a modern cuisine flair, like shrimp cocktail with a wasabi panna cotta and delicate yuzu sauce. \u00a0The US Angus filet I had was absolutely spot on and delicious.The wine list had a pretty good range in the by-the-glass selection and the bar had a good variety of cocktails--classic and innovative both.Stylistically I prefer the 'old school' New York/Chicago style steakhouses (this I would not categorize as \"Traditional American Restaurants\")--where the emphasis is on the excellence of the ingredients and mastery of basic dishes that compliment the centerpiece of the meal. \u00a0So while I enjoyed my experience, the match goes to other team--particularly when one considers that this player has a bigger paycheck than who it's up against.",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong, this is a great restaurant BUT I would never recommend it to anyone as it is massively over priced. The food is excellent and the service quite good. I had the pork belly as a starter and it was melt-in-the-mouth perfection. My husband and I shared the porterhouse which was delicious and perfectly cooked. The onion rings are excellent as well, exactly the way you always hope they'll be but rarely are. I had the S'mores for dessert and loved them. The wine menu is seriously extensive as is the cocktail menu. I loved the music but not sure that the Ramones would be to every diner's liking...But $900 for dinner for two at a steak house is far too much in my opinion. The mark-up on wine is huge. I just can't justify the cost.",

    "text": "The exterior of the restaurant was intimidating but thankfully I had the courage to walk in and order a drink at the bar. Because, it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life (sorry for the exaggeration).The bar menu was reasonable in price (not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu ). And, they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn. And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet. Their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.I am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich-sounding cocktail concoctions. The super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and I ended up with a drink called Dying Love (I may be mistaken but sounds like it). The drink was visually gorgeous - a raspberry resting on a slab of ice, floating on a pink sea. Similar to the movies Titanic and Life of Pi.From the bar menu, I ordered the mini steak burgers, 4 small ones on a cute white plate. While they are small, trust me, they are enough to fill you up. As an added bonus, they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu. So, it's a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending 100 dollars.All in all, Cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants I've been to. I have yet to try their fine dining area. But from my initial experience at the bar, I am sure I won't be disappointed when that time comes.",
