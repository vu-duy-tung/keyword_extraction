    "text": "I've been here a few times over the years and it's been consistent about two things: it's high price for honestly, pretty mediocre food. Tonight, was the final straw. A couple of friends and I were in a pinch and went in to grab a quick bite. My friend paid $9 for tofu, fish and rice from the (not so) econo-rice stall. I had the faux ayam penyet and veggie from Sumber Ayam ($9) and it made me sick. I went home and exploded from both ends. NEVER AGAIN!",

    "text": "It's a Food Republic. So you know it's gonna be pricey. That being said, there are a couple of stalls I come back to. The yong tau food stall has old school soup properly brewed with soy beans so that the umami is there. I like that they separate the fried ngoh hiang on a plate for you without you having to ask. The roast meat stall is not cheap, but if you're a big eater, the twin roast set meal with dumpling soup and poached veggies is just the thing. It's about $12 but you can pick a combi of duck, char siew, roast pork or chicken. The dumplings are good - sturdy stuffing of meat with identifiable and reasonably sized shrimp and crunchy woodear in HK style. The Toastbox is like any other Toastbox and it has a good selection of egg tarts, probably targeting the office workers in the neighbourhood who pop by for tea. I'm always baffled by why everyone queues at the Toastbox for coffee. The drinks stall is also Toastbox owned and operated - hello? Food Republic owned by them? So you can skip the queue and get your coffee fix from the drinks stall too.",
