    "text": "This seemed like a legitimate Southern Italian trattoria. The food was all fresh and simple. The seafood stew was great and about $12 cheaper than the normal ~$30 it tends to cost elsewhere (e.g. Pasta Brava). The spaghetti amatriciana was very nice. The best thing was the ribeye steak though with mushrooms and potatoes, which was extremely well seasoned and cooked and seemed like a lot of food. This is easily the best steak I have seen in Singapore at that price point. They also have gelato from Alfero, which is amazing. I will probably bring my family here when they visit.Service was a little avoidant but the food was good enough to make up for it. Only real shocker when the bill came was that the focaccia (pizza bianca) cost $12.80. It was really good and possibly worth it, but that is disproportionately expensive relative to the other items.",

We had a fairly attentive waiter, though he did once miss refilling our glasses.Don't be put off by the relatively high price of the appetisers, the portions are correspondingly generous. Our pastas and pizzas were all well done. Not too salty, very fresh and comfortingly homely.Overall, quite satisfying but slightly pricey.",

My friend and I had about an hour to spare for dinner before rushing off to a nearby venue to catch a performance. It was a wet and dreary friday evening around 630pm. The restaurant was actually pretty empty but the atmosphere was still warm and cosy cos of the lighting and deco. We quickly ordered our mains and didn't had the time for any appetizers nor dessert due to the rush but we thoroughly enjoyed our mains!Upon our order, a complimentary appetizer was served. Dont really know what's in it but its on a slice of crispy bread and it tastes great. Our mains were fantastic too. I ordered seafood pasta and my friend, a beef baked pasta. The portion was large and the ingredients were generous. Totally worth the price that we're paying. We left feeling a little sad cos we didnt had time to try the dessert, would have loved to spend more time enjoying our food and try more stuff.Would make a point to go there again!",

    "text": "There is a chill in the air when it comes to service at this restaurant. \u00a0Dined on a Saturday around 7:20pm slightly ahead of our reservation time. . \u00a0As it was early the dining room was empty. \u00a0We were seated quickly and provided menus. \u00a0A female member of the wait staff asked if we wanted a beverage. \u00a0WE ARE NON DRINKERS so we said water would be fine.The waiter comes over to our table and my partner and I ordered Tortelloni and Lasagna for our mains. \u00a0Again we were asked if we wanted wine or cocktaI with our meals. \u00a0Again we politely stated water would be fine and that we would be adding dessert at the end.The decision of no wine or cocktail did not sit well with our server. \u00a0He took a bottle off the table and presented our order to the kitchen. \u00a0Food arrived promptly but no follow up from our server.There were additional staff on the floor whose jobs it seems was to wisk plates off the table but all it felt like, as a customer, \u00a0was rushed service. \u00a0THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC. \u00a0It is a shame that all the effort is offset at \u00a0the front of the house.When we finished our entres we decided to close out our check and leave as fast as we could. \u00a0We went up the street for an after dinner coffee and dessert. \u00a0We did hear a few voices saying good night on our way out of the door.This was our second time visiting this dining spot. \u00a0The first time was a late night coffee and dessert. \u00a0That time also the food was very good but the reception staff was short and unwelcoming.Twice is enough for Lafiandra. \u00a0There are alot of excellent mid priced Italian eateries in Singapore to spend our money.A word of note to wait staff. \u00a0We were two business men dining with company support. \u00a0Support does not mean they cover wine and spirits. \u00a0That is okay by use as we are former spirit consumers. \u00a0I know it lends to a lower check but we should not be made to feel less than welcome because of it.",

Easily enough for two people to share. \u00a0Pastas similarly great servings and consistently well done.

I arrived at 10:10 and was told the kitchen was closed. Restaurant closes at 11. Maybe it's normal to close the kitchen that early, but seemed odd. I was old I could have lasagna or pizza, so picked the former. It was pretty good, but would have preferred marinara sauce vs the cheese sauce it came with. Also, closing an hour in advance wasn't awesome. Would recommend based on what I had access to.",

I figured a nice Italian Trattoria would figure out how to get good tomatoes, but no, the tomatoes were even worse than you find in Fair Price.
