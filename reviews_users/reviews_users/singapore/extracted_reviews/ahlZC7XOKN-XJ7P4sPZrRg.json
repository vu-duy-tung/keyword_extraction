    "text": "Perched on top of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, KU D\u00c9 TA is definitely one of the best views of the Singapore skyline you can get. A lot of tourists do not realise that while it costs $20 to tour around the Skypark, it makes much more sense to instead get a drink or meal at KU D\u00c9 TA, and with the receipt you can gain access to the Skypark as well. KU D\u00c9 TA is separated into two sections, a restaurant with a Skybar, and a club lounge on the other side towards the swimming pool. KU D\u00c9 TA restaurant is a modern Asian cuisine concept with a social dining aspect where we are encouraged to get a few dishes to share in the middle, which is a typically Asian tradition. My favourite dishes: the tempura yasai roll which was a beet and cream cheese sushi that was fried tempura-style, aburi salmon sashimi that had delicious salty miso notes, their signature crispy sticky baby squid and the seared yellowfin tuna steak which came with was separated into two: one with a lime seasoning and the other with a shishito pepper seasoning, with a huge blob of avocado sauce in the middle that was utterly delicious. However, the MUST-TRY is the desserts. Their signature Apple & Honey is not as simple as the name implies - it is a visual feast as well as a taste that was a sensory overload, which was surprisingly not overly sweet. A pleasant surprise was the Wasabi Ice Cream, which was really palatable and easy to eat even to some of my friends who usually do not take wasabi. Overall, the meal was not light on the wallet, but it was definitely in tune with their motto: 'A lifestyle less ordinary'.",

I was fortunate enough to be one of the first few people to go there when it was officially opened and I went back again to check out the service, and I must say it really isn't that awesome. There's a wide variety food and drinks on offer, though it's nothing much to shout about as they're all fairly decent and not exactly worth the price you pay. The views though, are a whole other matter, and if you haven't been there, you should pay the place a visit, and have some drinks instead. Do take note that you'll be standing as the tables are reserved for diners only.",

    "text": "I REALLY wanted to love this place. The view is spectacular and the restaurant space is gorgeous. The food, however, was terrible. We had thought that at 21 dollars, the mizuna salad would be a little more than just a bunch of citrusy greens with flavorless crumbs. The pork belly lollipops were lacking in flavor as well. My husband's beef tenderloin was, in his own words, \"disgusting\". My roasted salmon was below average. The fried rice was bland and oily. Even the cocktail I ordered had some unpleasant notes to it. Because we had met the minimum spend, we decided to skip dessert because we had no reason to expect that it would be worth paying for after the disappointment of the previous courses. The taste just wasn't there and we were still hungry when we left. It's just a bunch of trendy ingredients used in a way that brings nothing out of them on the flavor front.Overall, it seems like the chefs at KU DE TA don't feel they have to put in any effort because everyone is there for the view anyway and the minimum spend takes care of everything. As great as that view is, I'd never go back to this restaurant.",

    "text": "The view is certainly five stars and the food maybe 4.5, but the service was just barely there. We had a reservation at 8:30 pm for six people and were seated promptly. Ordering the wine and cocktails was an effort because we couldn't really find the waiter. There is a lot of fan fare around the menu presentation, putting little lights on so you could see in the semi-darkness, but beyond that we were waving down anyone who came near us. Food was great. All sharing style--we had raw oysters (not much can go wrong), the beef carpaccio was nice simply because the cut of beef was to die for, sushi rolls were pulled-from-the-sea but we had to ask for more wasabi, sashimi salad was very nice. The lamb was tasty and cooked to perfection, the seared scallops were overpowered by some overrout foam perched on the top, the pork belly was fabulous, perfectly seasoned and the grilled halibut was a real treat. For dessert, the garam masala cake was a sweet ending to the meal as was the chocolate fondant. Sounds like we had a lot (I didn't even mention everything) but really just small bites and pretty much everything was delicious, but without distinction for the price. You pay for the view and it's worth it. Singapore at your feet is very delightful--the 57th floor overlooking everything--ahhhhhh. Make sure you bring plenty of Sing dollars!",

    "text": "I know, I know.When you think Ku De Ta... you probably let out a wistful whistle, and gush at how awesome the view must be.For me, that was EXACTLY IT... but not much else.I was there as part of \u00a0a big party - 12 of us for a cousin's birthday, so I thought we'd be able to try lots of stuff. After all, the server did remind us that the restaurant concept was built around sharing plates. Being a big-ish party meant we ordered a fair amount of food, and we waited with glee for them to emerge from the kitchen, and as the appetisers rolled out, I did a little cheer on the inside - I was super hungry! But then I realised.... we got sushi? It kinda looked like a California maki, except it had a ton of roe on the top. Pretty... but boring. Then came the vegetable tempura (meh), cold spinach (meh) and a squid tempura? That was pretty tasty. It wasn't all bad, there was a pretty amazing salad - great dressing - with an amazing COLD sliced pork belly. Now this was a cold sliced meat, and in the words of many (who might have been speaking about other things...), that belly? It seriously just melts in your mouth. The chilled meat had this gelatinous texture that was quite a distinction. So that was pretty good.The entrees though... were the bulk of the let-down. I'll be brief. The good? \u00a0We had some well-seasoned lamb.We also had some prime Angus, and duck that didn't taste like duck, and I don't think in a good way. We had some garlic chicken? Mum wanted some carbs, so we had fried udon, but it appeared and tasted like phad thai, and it wasn't even good pad thai. Felt like someone tried to be too Asian. But this is Asia, you argue. But what do you say to sesame seeds on almost everything?Time for dessert, and we were hoping for redemption. Beautiful plates. I got a steamed palm sugar cake dish, but my cake... was kinda dry. the other elements were tasty though - a quenelle each of salted caramel and hazelnut cream, and some puffed rice for texture? The Bounty cake wasn't bad either, and I think we enjoyed the extra scoops of coconut ice cream and lychee sorbet best. Those were made on premises, so they get points for that.At the end of the night, the view is the most redeeming. It's always amazing to see a city skyline from height, and our city's skyline is rather pretty indeed. Come for the view - that, at least, deserves the trip.",

Pros:1) Great panoramic view of Singapore. 2) Cocktails were excellent and the bar puts a unique twist on some of the classics (ex. Adding charred orange and cherry to an old fashioned). Cons:1) After 6pm, they enforce a dress code, which requires pants for men (in a roasting Singaporean climate!)2) We were there around lunch time on a not-busy week day and service was slow.",

    "text": "I read all the reviews before walking over here from the Pan Pacific. Most of the are spot on but I think it depends on your own experience.First, I made reservations 2 hours before. I was surprised it was that easy but it was a Wed night. To get to the restaurant you must wait in line at Tower 3. If you have a reservation or going to the bar they will give you a red entry ticket. The elevator only goes to the top so there is no stopping. When you get out there are numerous people around to ensure you get to where your going. But most important ensure you do not get access to where you're not supposed to.First, the wait staff is out of this world. Never had an empty glass, always attentive, napkin in lap 3 times, amazing! \u00a0The staff gets 2 stars alone. Second, the food. Eh. I ordered the Salmon and it was just \"ok\". This place is ala carte so when ordering Salmon, you only get Salmon. I had to order a bowl of rice just to make sure I felt like I was eating something. Half star for food only because I the Salmon was that of a chain restaurant. My salmon, a bowl of rice and water and it was over $S100. So yes, it's expensive.The views from this side of the rooftop bar is not that great. You have to go to the Lounge for the stunning views. Read my review on that as well. So other than being expensive for what you get I say 2 stars for the service, 1/2 star for the food and a half star for the location.",

    "text": "This review is mainly for the food at the restaurant. Let me start by saying that the view and ambiance is amazing, which is what you're going to pay top dollar for because the food is horrendous. I was there last night and basically spent $350.00 dollars just to be fed tablespoons full of salt and lime. Everything was topped off with buckets of salt like it's going out of fashion. I had to go back to my hotel and order a 2nd dinner because there was no way to eat the disaster they were trying to feed everyone. Bottom line: be smart and enjoy the view with some drinks....but save a lot of money by eating elsewhere. I know I'm personally never coming back here and am making sure no one else I know wastes their time or money here either!",

    "text": "In short, not worth it.We went up there because we heard the view is good. I was immediately stopped by the lady downstairs because of my shorts. I didn't want to disappoint my group so I went shopping for a pair of pants in the casino mall. Everything was expensive there. I wish there was a Costco or Walmart. But even the usual brands such as Gap cost at least twice as much as in the US. Finally I found a cargo pants at Guess marked down from S$120 to S$40 (~$32). I wouldn't pay $10 for it if I didn't have to go to the top.When we got to the top, first thing we noticed was that the bar area is separated from the observation deck and guarded. To see the view, you have to look beyond the observation deck, which makes the view from the bar obscured. The bar area is tiny and crowded. It turns out if you are only having drinks, you have to stand.A small beer costs S$16 and a small cocktail costs S$23. I've had way better drinks. They make the $20 martini on top of the Park Hyatt Shinjuku so worth it. We had seven people including two little kids. The first thing the waitress asked us was why we ordered only five drinks. BTW Singapore's legal drinking age is also 21.I walked around a little trying to catch different views. When I walked back to the bar area, I was stopped by a waiter asking if I was going to buy a drink.The view on the top, even without being obscured, is not that great. You can go to many high grounds (and free) in Hong Kong and have way better view of the skyline.I think they made one fundamental mistake - that is in order to stop a few lookie loo, they pissed many paying customers. Very different from how things are done here in the US.",

This restaurant is a perfect place to end your Sky Park experience. Although you can only dine inside via a reservation, you can take advantage of their bar. Our Sky Park experience ended with a noon cocktail. My mother had a rum-based orange drink while I had a vodka-based peach drink. I know it may sound weird, but surprisingly, it felt really good. The drinks were mixed well, we weren't able to taste that overwhelming alcohol. Just plain tropical refreshing goodness. Yes it was pricey but once in a while, it doesn't hurt to indulge.Aside from drinking, if you have something to celebrate and wish to do it on top of the world, Ku De Ta is just a phone call away to make your reservations",

Infinity pool on top of one of the tallest buildings in Singapore! I was impressed for sure! Far more than I expected.I didn't try the food, and the drinks were insanely expensive. I came here to watch the sunset while having drinks with friends. It was a mix of classy, casual, business, and elegant all at once. There were people who had been at the pool all day, others who were there for an after work drink, guests of the casino downstairs, and tourists like me \u00a0all in the same place. It was a beautiful view and setting. We would have planned to stay longer but had tickets to a music show the same night.A must see!",

    "text": "After reading some of the other reviews of this restaurant on Yelp i was hesitant to try it. Being part of the Marina Bay Sands extravaganza, i knew it would be pricey, but i also knew it could be quite an unforgettable experience- and it did not disappoint!My friend and i had just been on a holiday through Germany and Switzerland over the Christmas and new year period, and had a few days in Singapore to thaw out and recover somewhat from our jet lag. Being the last night of our holiday, we wanted to do something memorable and a little bit fancy. After being recommended by friends that we \"must go to The Raffles and have a Singapore Sling\", and being slightly disappointed with the result, we decided to rely on our trusty Yelp app and see what else Singapore had to offer. Ku De Ta promptly popped up on the list, \u00a0i had heard about the views from the sky deck previously from a work colleague so flicked through some recent reviews. By booking in to the restaurant we didn't have to pay the usual $20 to get to the sky deck, so we went up early and had a drink at the sky bar. We were greeted quickly by multiple friendly staff, and very soon we were sipping on cocktails and taking in the view- and what a view it was! With 180 degree uninterrupted views across the city and the bay, i would've been quite happy to pay the $20 for the view alone. It really is fantastic.The staff at Ku De Ta are brilliant. They're attentive and friendly, and go out of their way to make you as comfortable as possible. The menu is designed in a way that you are inclined to order a bunch of smaller dishes to share, so that's what we did.We ordered about five dishes to share, and all of them were exceptional. The mushroom, the pork, the scallops- all perfectly cooked, the flavours were balanced and there were a nice combination of different textures too. The dishes were all plated with care, it was obvious the chef had thought of all aspects of the dining experience when creating the menu. I suppose the only downfall of the whole experience was the dessert- the flavours were surprisingly bland after such fresh and enjoyable combinations in the previous course; and yes, the wine and other alcoholic drinks we ordered with our meal and afterwards at the bar were really pricey. But, from what i could tell, alcohol anywhere in Singapore is pricey!All in all, it was an amazing experience, the views were phenomenal (especially once the sun set), the wait staff are friendly and attentive and the food although not the cheapest around, was delicious, well presented and creative. Would i go back next time i'm in Singapore? Absolutely! For a special last-night-out meal and a fantastic cocktail with the best view of the city- you can't get better than Ku De Ta! I'd probably skip the bottle of wine with dinner to save a couple of bucks next time though... ;-)",

KU DE TA is directly adjacent to the infinity pool, so you get amazing views looking into the city while youre at the bar. The service, however, is terrible. It may have been so bad at the particular time I went because there was a private party, and many of the servers looked occupied with that. We sat ourselves, got our own menus and had to go to the bar to order. The menus looked old and the pages were creased and unprofessional looking, the drinks were expensive and we had to ask 3 times for glasses of water. In conclusion, you pay for the awesome views. That's it. You don't pay for nice menus or impeccable service. I was disappointed to say the least. I would even venture to say that if I go again to see the view and the service is just as terrible, I'll take my photos and leave without getting a drink. Ku De Ta, you get 1 star for the view, 1 star for the drink selection ($40 sangria for 2 people) and wasabi chips.",

He informed us that we'd have to pay to get to the deck for the views and that it was worth it to go up to eat. He called the night before to reserve a covered table on the patio and we got an excellent view from the corner of the deck. We both ordered the brunch ($98 each), which included oysters, salmon sashimi, tuna tataki, prawn salad with glass noodle, cucumber salad, prawn and vegetable tempura, and miso soup in addition to a main course selection and juice, coffee, tea and soft drinks. I ordered the donburi (pork belly, mix vegetables with chili garlic, teriyaki). I was very pleased with all of the food, but will say it was definitely a Paleo cheat meal. I did my best to avoid the tempura, rice and soy-based food, but know that it was impossible to avoid completely. The gentleman who seated us was very nice, but other than that, the service was lack luster and one woman was borderline rude.I thought it was a unique experience with a really gorgeous view of Singapore, and the people watching was awesome. This is not a place that we will frequent because on top of the expensive spread, parking wasn't fun and neither was navigating the mall to get there. But...If we have guests in town, this will be a must, along with dinner at the Equinox restaurant on the 70th floor of the Swissotel.",

The best time is around 6:30 pm to catch the sunset. Cocktails are over $20 but at least they are good. The food which is Asian fusion with a heavy emphasis on Japanese is equally pricey but high quality and delicious. Service is impeccable. All dishes are shared family style. Can you buy yourself about 5 meals in Singapore for the price of one cocktail here? Sure you can and I normally have an aversion against grotesquely overpriced shi-shi places but the breathtaking view is one that you'll remember a lifetime.",

Literally the only reason to give it a 4 instead of a 5 is service in consistencies but all in all its a killer place!My favourite on the menu would definitely have to be the black miso cod, however they seem to change their menu quite frequently, which I like, but means you have to check before you order because that 'beef dish you liked last time' may not be the same one anymore!

    "text": "Ce la vie, french word for that's life. Okay so let start out with the location, this club is located at marina bay sands tower 3, there be a reception right at the lobby where you get checked in and you will receive a card if your on guestlist to be given to another reception counter at 57 floor. If you felt like you had a hard day of work and your urban scape kinda person, the view up there is amazing at night no doubt. What makes it amazing it is because its not fully glass caged like your in a fish tank. For members they have sofas and rectangle tables to kick back and relax on, but if your not there are plenty of standing tables near the entrance where you can enjoy your favorite drink, view and music.Interior, there nothing much to describe really, when you walk into the club its pretty dim setting, so there nothing fancy much you can see.. Pretty standard sofas by the side of the dance floor for you people who feeling rich, you can ball all you want. Its not really big, sits max 4 each side. The feeling you get is a very beach setting in a sheltered environment but its actually a open air club. You can't really feel the air con if you're vividly dancing around like a bunny to impress some girls.Dance floorMy favourite segment, they have a really huge space for you to glide around which i really love. But it get crowded too early and especially the crowd there are mostly expats in the 30s and we asian are small built, best part we are dancers so we dont need a football field to bust a move.ServiceThe servers are efficient, polite and professional. Although the orders took awhile to reach it makes up for the service we had. The only set back we had was the door bitches, i believe they can handle the situation better by being more approachable, smiley and not by living your stage name as a door bitch. We had some issues with the guestlist as they miscalculated or some information was not communicated properly but it was all good in the end.Conclusion It is a definete place to checkout, chill have a beer or whatever you feel like.. Or dance till you drop retarded.",

Highly recommend anyone heading to Singapore to go for just one drink and soak up the incredible view.",

Everyone had a difficult time just getting drinks. \u00a0When we finally got our drinks, they were watered down and gross. \u00a0I didn't get gin and tonic, I think I just got tonic minus the carbonation. \u00a0When we converted the bill, we realized we paid about $22 per drink. The crowed was mixed ethnicity, beautiful young people who work in the city, business guys in button downs, models, a few tourists, and older people (I'm guessing they're guests of the hotel and got in just like we did).We got on the dance floor for about 10mins and it was just too crowded. \u00a0The music was pumping and the DJ was really good, but the space was just too small. \u00a0The bar takes up about 1/10th of the entire rooftop at the top of the Marina Bay sands hotel. \u00a0The next day when we went to the pool, we saw just how small it was. \u00a0I guess there's no limit on the number of people to cram into an outdoor bar with a view.",

Of course the views are impeccable since it i the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, but the food was average and over-priced. \u00a0Both my husband and I were excited about the miso black cod they had on the menu, but it turned out to be such a small portion and the fish was not cooked well. I think we paid almost $200+ for lunch for 4 of us and weren't even drinking. \u00a0We did a have a few drinks at their bar the night before, and now that I recall those were very pricey as well- guess you are paying for the views!",

Cocktails around S$24 which I thought was reasonable, service a bit patchy due to new staff being on.Worth it for the views and it was lovely on a Sunday afternoon. Great DJ - bit of soul, classics and dance so a cool brunch vibe and I could have stayed longer. Dress code then is casual but post 5.30pm, formal dress (no shorts for men) is stated on signs at the bar. Cocktail was good - Royal Smile I think, it was slightly sour but refreshing and just what was required. I would go back on my next visit.",

My friends and I were out all day being tourists and didn't realize that this place had a dress code. Thankfully, we were able to get in with our comfy gear on (tennis shoes, jeans, regular tops/jersey) since it was complimentary Ladies Night and that we all happened to be girls. However, we did get quite the stare down from the hostess and security that made us feel quite uncomfortable. Despite us being a bit under dressed, we made the trek up to the roof top bar. Unfortunately, the observatory deck was closed to the public but you could still wander around the bar area and see the city through various spots. Tried to take some pictures but there was just too many people clustered around the areas where you could peek out to see the view. As for the bar itself, it took a really long time to even put in an order (given that this was a Wednesday night) so my friends and I just left. Throughout our experience, we kept getting stopped by the staff to ask if we were going to drink and the pressure to buy something is pretty strong here.Overall, not quite worth the time to visit this place if you're only here to see the city view.",

Again, the portion was very small for that price. However, the warm chocolate cake was excellent. I would only recommend this restaurant if you're keen on the view!",

You should probably try the Mushroom Dumplings and a fish dish with a really delicious broth (I can't remember the name), together with the chilli corn and the crushed potatoes. They are the starts of the show. The desert platter (L) also not to be missed! However, some dishes were underperforming, like the Bombay Potatoes, which were sort of bland, \u00a0and the Korean BBQ Chicken, which was a tad too sweet. That's why 4 stars and not 5. Beautiful plating and great ambience especially during special times like F1, NDP or NYE. If you're up for the price, I strongly recommend this place for you.",

I did not have food but I met friends for drink and all of the drinks were pretty awful if I'm being honest. They were over priced as well. I think one was $22 and there was absolutely noting special about it. Service also left a lot to be desired. Seems like we waited forever to get the few drinks we did order. I'd go back just for the view but I'd probably just order beer (Singapore doesn't really have good beer) next time. This would be a good place to go with friends being that you don't have to pay to get in and the atmosphere is relaxed.Not so humbly submitted,Michael C.",

The food was subpar. Steak was cooked to correct temperature but the overall dish lacked balance. Sides were overpriced (ordered the potatoes and rice) and those fell flat too.Our water glasses were never refilled. There's a shortage of wait staff to adequately service their respective areas but management knows people will still come even with poor customer service.

The view was amazing, with all the lights of Singapore and the Gardens by the Bay; that's undeniable.The service was terrible. The servers were nice, but the restaurant felt severely understaffed. It took forever to flag down anyone. One of the girls in my party had a slight cough and needed water, but it took over 15 minutes and us asking several times before we actually got the water. It also took a while to order; instead of the waiter coming to take our order, we had to ask to order. The food itself was decent but definitely expensive for what it was.

You get a voucher that you can use toward any drink or food. Most specialty cocktails are about $25.00. The food is also a constant recommendation by locals.We went just before dusk; the Skyline view was absolutely stunning. No trip to SG is complete without a trip to MBS for the breathtaking views. We could've stayed here all night gauging across the beautiful Skyline. \u00a0However, shopping the 22 shopping malls on Orchard Rd. Wasn't enough, I had to endulge inside at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. That two level CHANEL Store was calling my name, and I knew I would regret not picking up some macarons and tea from TWS.",

The modern Asian influenced menu was surprisingly tasty. \u00a0We had a large group so had a set menu. \u00a0Everyone in our group commented on how tasty the dishes were. \u00a0The wine selection was also decent, as were the creative cocktails. \u00a0Every dish was packed full of amazing flavor. \u00a0The service was incredible. \u00a0The views were breathtaking. \u00a0The views from here definitely beat the Singapore Flyer. \u00a0The sunset from the top was jaw dropping. \u00a0There is nothing like the twinkling night lights of the Singapore skyline.",

    "text": "So I was both disappointed and pleasantly surprised by Ce La Vi - yes, at the same time. First off, when I made a reservation for dinner the website made it look like the tables were private from the bar area where anyone can walk-in but instead we were seated in an area that was attached to the bar with people on both sides of us. It was marked off with some potted plants and red velvety type ropes but it was definitely not private and you are still pretty much in the bar. To their bonus, they do a good job of keeping the bar patrons out of the dining area as several tried to enter but it is a little disruptive being right next to the bar. I was pleasantly surprised by 1) the view which was absolutely stellar. Even better than the viewing deck below as it's completely unobstructed. We were just in awe at how gorgeous it was, and 2) the food. Yes, I had somewhat of low expectations of the food as when a place has some sort of gimmick (i.e. view) the food isn't always their focal point. However, the food here was really impressive. The standouts were the foie gras - prepared perfectly seared and topped with yuzu jelly pomegranate reduction (heaven!) and the roasted lemongrass chicken with eggplant, zucchini, & a kaffir lime green chili sauce. Ce La Vi is definitely worth a visit if you are staying in Singapore or at Marina Bay Sands. It is a little pricey but very worth it as the food was delicious and the views are second to none - just don't expect a private evening. ;)",

    "text": "This place is also a club. It used to be called Ku De Ta. It has a a really good vibe and I must say I love it. There is a night club nearby and this place classifies as a pre bar or club because it closed at 11pm. They serve some pretty nice drinks with a good view. I wish they did not have to close early. Singapore has a good night life and this place rally seals the deal. I usually drive up in the bottom floor and pay the parking fare before coming here. If you want to go somewhere else after 11pm then that is the best thing to do. \u00a0They have a live DJ that plays anything from familiar song remixes to total EDM. You will not regret this place. There is a great bird of the South side from the premisesDrawback: hope you like long elevator rides because you will need it to come here.",

    "text": "As you've probably guessed, you pay for the view. Purchase the $20 entrance fee on the ground floor, and you can redeem it for drinks at C\u00c9 LA VIE (if you opt for the observation deck, which apparently has a 360\u00b0 view, you pay more and can't put your payment towards drinks. The observation deck was closed the day of my visit).The bar was peppered with tourists and their cameras that afternoon, but since we weren't pretending to go for the drinks, that was okay. We snapped photos of the bay along with everyone else and slowly sipped our drinks (the cocktails pack a punch--I had the Penicillin, a whiskey concoction). We weren't tempted to order food (though the pizza served on a chopping board did smell appetizing), afraid it would look better than it tasted and wouldn't be worth the price.Bottom line: if you're new in town, pop here for a leisurely afternoon drink and enjoy the view.",

    "text": "CE LA VI offers incredible views of Singapore whilst wining and dining. Making reservations was a simple phone call away, and getting there is quite easy. I mean, you can't really miss the Marina Bay Sands hotel!Although we made reservations, we still had to wait a few minutes for our table to be cleared. This gave us the chance to check out the attached bar/club. This was where we got the best views available to restaurant patrons. (There is an even better observation deck, but that's reserved for hotel guests only.)We also got drinks while we waited as well. As other reviews state, everything here is overpriced, but it comes with the territory so set your expectations (and budget) accordingly. The only real complaint from our visit is that the bar staff got confused and tried to charge me twice for the drinks. It was resolved quickly, just in time for us to be seated.We were comfortably seated outdoors on an elevated and covered area. This was probably for the best as other tourists and visitors crowd the perimeter tables to try and get the best photos of the skyline - something you don't want to deal with when you're trying to enjoy your meal.Service was attentive, although it could've been a little quicker. Food, much like the drinks, was overpriced, but still pretty good. I expected to be blown away, but don't quite remember any exceptional bites.Overall, it was a good meal and a good experience. Just be sure to adjust your expectations, consider the experience and value as a whole, and you'll have a great time.",
