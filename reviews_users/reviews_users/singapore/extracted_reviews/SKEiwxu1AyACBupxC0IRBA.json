    "text": "MOST HORRID DINING EXPERIENCE. We ordered the blackmore steak which we wanted in medium rare but the person who took our orders said that it can only be done in medium. So my sister and i decided to try it since he said that it is the most popular steak there. When the steak arrived we realised that it is well done and the meat was extremely tough. \u00a0We were directed to the Chef and he said there is not supposed to be a doneness for this steak. We asked for a change of steak since we were given the wrong information of the doneness on the steaks. The steak was replaced without them saying much but we were given a rude shock when we asked for the bill and had to pay for one additional steak. In total we paid 4 steaks for 3 of us besides all the other side dishes that we ordered. We only had one bite out of the one which was cooked to well done btw. When the bill came the Chef told me that AFTER they served us the replacement steak they cut open our steaks and one of it was cooked to the \"correct doneness\" - which I don't know what they meant cause there is not supposed to be a doneness according to the Chef and therefore they will charge us for one of the replacement steaks. \u00a0It's definitely not the chef's fault BUT HOW RIDICULOUS?! WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!",

    "text": "$45 bucks for a Lobster Roll! Holy jeepers. So much for those $5 lobster roll I used to have during my vacations in Maine. You'd think these lobsters flew first class to Singapore, looking at those prices. \u00a0Prices aside, Market Grill has the Best Lobster Roll in Singapore! The bread is perfectly battered and beautifully crisp on the outside (toasted brioche roll). Personally, I'm not a big fan of large chucks of celery in my lobster roll, which is oh so common in the US Northeast. I find that celery overpowers the lobster. Fortunately, there is none of that in this lobster roll. The lobster is without question, the main attraction. You'd figure that to be case when an entire lobster (500grams) is stuffed into the roll. The lobsters themselves are as fresh as they come with a full storage tank of live Maine lobsters ready to be eaten. I must confess these lobsters are on the \"thin\" side, probably because they've had to travel half around to world to get here. Hehe. Typically you'd see a layer of white fat on the meat, which I Love. Nevertheless, FRESH lobster in Singapore is good enough for meThe one disappointing dish I did have was the Duck Rilette - rich preserved duck meat. I thought it was dry, boring and a little bit tasteless if you ask me. Contained in a small glass canister, I just felt that it was sitting in the fridge a little too long with all the nutrients and taste sucked away. You also get a handful of bread slices to come along with the pate like dish, left you wanting more.5 star for the lobster roll, 2-3 star for the Dick Rillete and 4 star for the price (you are getting fresh lobster, so I'll give them a bone for burning a hole in my wallet!) ;D",

    "text": "A lobster craving sent me searching for the best lobster roll in Singapore. It's funny how i've not had any in Singapore but i didn't want to set myself up for disappointment after having some really awesome ones in NYC and Boston. So when the option of The Naked Finn failed me for dinner (they only serve the rolls during lunch), i headed to Loh Lik Peng's The Market Grill.Gf ordered the Crispy Pig Ear ($18) behind my back when the Buttermilk frog legs were not available. This is a dish i would never order. Well thankfully it only tasted like fried skin and the soft bone wasn't that hard and crunchy.I should have simply insisted on having the Cod Croquetas ($19) from the start. They're these sinful balls of Spanish paprika spiced Atlantic cod and fluffy potato balls that are battered and deep fried. I liked that it has a nice spice to it and it's paired with this wicked and pungent aioli (which is amazing).The Atlantic Lobster Slider ($45) is made from a whole steamed live lobster of approx 500gm. The meat is chilled first and then tossed in herb mayonnaise before being served on a perfectly buttered and grilled crustless brioche bun.I found the roll a little bland on the first few bites. Perhaps it was the claw meat which wasn't quite coated with the sauce. I'm a fan of the salty buttered hot roll at Neptune Oyster in Boston (that is in a league of its own). That said, the light touch on the seasoning allowed the sweetness of the lobster to come through. It's not as perfect as Neptune's but it's ok. The fries were ridiculous though. I mean who doesn't know that the fries hold almost an equal weight as the lobster! Tsk. These were cardboardish and the equivalent of a fat MacD fry.The Chargrilled Whole Lobster ($45) 500gm seems like a pretty good option too if you would like to get your hands dirtied. This is served with clarified butter lightly infused with garlic, brightened with a squeeze of lemon, and sides of salad and mashed potatoes. The burgers are all the rage at The Market Grill as well but i was kinda disappointed with the lack of seasoning on the patty. Granted that my CW Breakfast Burger ($23) came with 150g chuck meat hand-formed patty was faulty and grilled to medium rare perfection and a patty could hardly go wrong with bacon, sunny side and cheddar cheese but somehow just underwhelming compared to the lobster roll. More overeating ensued with desserts and we went with the Rum Banana Pockets ($15). Think gooey dark rum soaked bananas encased in a crispy pastry and topped with a crunchy nut crumble. Of course there must be ice cream and the rum and raisin was satisfying with the hot mix.Overall a decent dinner at The Market Grill. Will head back for lobster roll minus the fries.",

    "text": "I know you're looking at this one star review and thinking, \"Another super pretentious person got mad because the waiter dropped their napkin.\" I use Yelp a lot, and trust me I am not one to really complain. The only reason I am writing you this review is to save your cold hard cash. This place is too expensive to waste your money on - especially in an area of Singapore absolutely stuffed with good food. Okay - that's my warning, now onto the review. I went here explicitly because I had heard that they had amazing hamburgers. I am from the South of the U.S. and take hamburgers quite seriously as a matter of fact, so I was very eager to give this a whirl. Also before I start this review I will say that this place looked nice and the wait service, although pretty novice, was polite. I think they spent all their money on rent though. I had the breakfast burger which cost $26. I would like to point out that the DB Bistro burger in NYC, arguably the most famous and luxurious burger of all time, is only $35. So for $26 I was expecting a pretty darn good burger. The burger is served with a side salad and french fries. The salad was pathetic. Some mixed greens with a single slice of tomato. I thought it was the burger toppings for a moment. The french fries were also not bad, but mediocre. At the Market Grill you can watch them \u00a0make everything in front of you. A good fry should be fried twice - pretty much common knowledge if you make fries. This was definitely not, and they were the mushy fries you would expect at a quick home-style drive through in the U.S. There were also only eight fries served with the burger. I was so surprised with how meager the portions were I actually bothered to count them. Heinz ketchup was on the house. Now onto the burger - not bad. Not great. If this had cost 8 dollars I would've been pretty pleased. The burger meat tasted a lot like meatloaf though and not grilled charbroiled deliciousness. The cheese was quite good on the burger and the bun, if indeed hand made, was also decent. The burger wasn't exactly large, and charging $26 for it is absolutely laughable. Deciding that I was still hungry, but willing to give this place one last shot I ordered some carrot cake. This is when the place really showed its true colors. If you ever want to evaluate a nice restaurant, order dessert. For $14 I watched one of the cooks remove a plastic wrapped slab of carrot-cake from a freezer, and then proceed to micro-wave it (with the plastic wrap on it). He then put a small dollop of pre-made whip cream on top. Finally he reached into a freezer and literally scraped the last remnants of no-name generic vanilla ice cream from a plastic pint with the crunch of tale-tale freezer burn. Placing the plate in front of me I had one bite of the cake and one bite of the ice-cream. Horrible. I mean really, I never complain about food and usually just pay and leave and let my absence and further word of mouth recommendations speak for themselves, but for the price of everything I had to tell the waiter. I asked if the chef was there and she said yes, then approached him, had a quick chat and came back. The chef never approached me to ask what was wrong. She offered a different dessert and I told her that was fine, no thank you, and that I would still pay for my dessert. They didn't end up charging me for it and the waitress apologized and asked me what was wrong with it - to which I explained the situation. I live in this area and you're out and about and want some good food here is my recommendation - go across the street and get a curry fish head for $8. It's damned good. Or - if you want a big portion of real American cuisine go up to Ann Sing hill to Jerry's Grill and order BBQ Ribs and pulled pork. You won't be able to finish it all and it's the real deal.",

    "text": "This is definitely a pricier choice for lunch in the CBD, but sometimes I like to have a nice lunch with service and good quality food. Two of us sat at the bar area where you can watch the chefs prepare the food. We weren't too hungry but wanted to try this place, so we ordered a cod fish burger and a Caesar salad (not the most exciting choice) to share (and later a banana rum pocket for dessert).We sat in front of the guy prepare the salad and the dessert, and they definitely were trying to stay efficient since they had a process down. This guy mainly took care of salads, another guy made burgers/fries, and some other guys made the other stuff including steak. It was a good thing we sat at the bar area, because the time between ordering and seeing our food ready was a bit long...and also between finishing your entree/ordering dessert and receiving it. The ingredients were already somewhat prepared, but they definitely still prepared the full dish on the spot and took special care in plating the dishes. Our lettuce for the Caesar salad was nicely cut from one head of Romaine lettuce and neatly stacked. The banana rum pocket had to be wrapped and then put on the stove, baked, and plated with some rum ice cream and crumble.The food was definitely high quality. The cod fish's texture was so fresh and light. The taste was ok though...if they could add more distinct flavor...it might just be perfect. The Caesar salad however boring of a salad was refreshing. Banana rum pockets also felt more special because we saw them make it. I would say the food is not out of this world...I can't say I've had that feeling since living in NY, but this place is good.We got hungrier watching them make the roast beef salad that seemed to be popular and the lobster slider (they have live lobsters). I wish the slider was called a \u00a0\"lobster slider roll\" or \"lobster roll\" like on the US East Coast, because I imagined tiny hamburgers. We'll definitely come back again and try other items on the menu. It's definitely not a regular lunch place given its price tag -- we spent about $60 for 2 ppl (1 salad, 1 burger, and 1 dessert), but it's good quality for $. and worth the occasional lunch treat.",

So I only really like one out of the five new places that I visit. Market Grill is that one.I had the dishes everyone raves about: the lobster slider and the CW Bleu burger. I don't think a great deal more needs to be said. They were both amazing. The place doesn't take reservations (of course) but I found it easy enough to get a seat here for dinner on a Saturday. Food was served quickly, as was beer (thank goodness) and service wasn't perfect but was good enough.I can't resist giving the five star review though. The burger and slider were really that good. Tuck in, people.Oh and by the way, one word about the prices: they're really quite reasonable as far as current standards go. Twenty bucks and change for a burger of that quality is a very fair deal indeed.",

I hoped on the hipster bandwagon in coming to this restaurant - but I couldn't resist. the myriad reviews coming out were too positive and too curiosity-inciting for me to ignore, and I'm glad this place more than lived up to they hype. the food was delicious, the ambience cosy - I only wished the prices were a little less on the high side.let's start with the obvious. obscure location, check; portlandish aspirations, check; old-school that never happened here, check. and yet, this place is endearing - the tables aren't too cramped, there's just the right amount of people for a pleasant hum in the air, and I have a soft spot for great design, even if it has vaunted provenance in a school of thought I don't belong to.to cut to the short of it - there are far too many reviews about this place - the food was fantastic. we had the lobster (of course we did), and while rather small - the flesh was sweet and succulent, dripping with delicious seafoody brine.but even better than the lobster, was the dreamy cut of steak we had. we had the bavette at medium-rare - it came pink and juicy and tender and beefy. and with silky caramelized onions atop, and a petite jug of complexly savoury gravy - this was truly silence-inspiring cooking at its best.we finished with their rum banana pockets. this was the weakest dish - the pastry a little too thick and oily, though at least the bananas were satisfyingly soft.so - we came (somewhat) for the lobster, but we'll return for the beef. they have a real charcoal grill and the cooking truly is expert. and the place is gorgeous and intimate, pretensions aside.we had a surly indian waiter - not hipster cool but genuinely unpleasant - which marred the experience somewhat, but the other female waitresses were friendly and pleasant, and the food came well enough. come here for beef (I have hopes for their other grilled meats), then go elsewhere for dessert. but really,in all, well-deserving of the hype.",

Don't mess up the standard sides and serve alcohol.I was expecting some good beef to match the sexy looking fridge they had behind the counter. But everything on the steak section of the regular menu was grain fed except the ox tongue, which I love but wasn't in the mood for. So I ended up getting a \"grass fed rib eye\" off the chef's recommendation list, medium rare. It came medium rare alright but it was also lukewarm and lacked the punchy beefy flavor you'd expect from a non-feedlot cow. My steak was also under seasoned so I did the horrific and asked for the salt & pepper shaker. In addition, my fries were soggy, though the side salad was fine. I started to hear that Chinese jingle my friend likes to sing...\"gua gua gua\".The other half had a chicken burger and it's probably the reason I didn't rate this place a one. It was a very bare burger but the chicken was tasty and hot off the grill (which makes no sense with the steak,no?).Nail in the coffin for me was the service, though it's not the fault of the servers This place is very understaffed considering it was a Friday night and I saw at least 3 covers being done at the bar alone. There were 3 women serving probably 50 diners at any time, which explains why when I asked for water twice, it came almost 25 minutes after I sat down. If the folks who own this place wanted me to drink more beer, it would've worked if my pear cider didn't cost $18 and Jigger/Flying Squirrel wasn't around the corner. Whenever we could get service, it was decent. Would I return? Even if I didn't have to foot the bill, wait an hour for a seat.... maybe just once to assess whether I visited on an off day.",

There are 5 things in the menu that is not available. The mains are quite pricey for what it is. Would not recommend going to this place.",
