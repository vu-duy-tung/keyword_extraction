This, way I was able to order both the black pepper and chili crab. \u00a0Overall, I thought the finished dish did not due justice to the quality of the crab. \u00a0I'm not a big fan of pepper, and found the black pepper crab had too strong of a pepper flavor. \u00a0The chili crab was too sweet. \u00a0I would probably give a five star had I ordered the butter garlic crab. \u00a0Not sure if there flavor is up to par or not, but the excellent quality of the crab and affordability alone earn Chinatown seafood a 4 star, considering my ignorance on what this dish is supposed to taste like.",

Here are reasons NOT to go here:- You can have the same food for 1/3 of the price in other coffee shops (the restaurants with the plastic chairs) around singapore. Therefore, i classify this a tourist trap. Note: I'm living in singapore 2.5 years.- twice I've asked to sit here just to have a beer and people watch. They refuse cos they want to clean your wallet of every cent purchasing their over priced average food.- when I did decide to go in ( in the past I will not go in again) I found the staff extremely rude. - there is one staff lady who is not fit to be a waitress. I've seen her shout at people and I've been victim to her shouting too. Please read the other reviews I've read them all and many mention this rude employee.- I've had 1 meal here. If your idea of a good night's meal is to suffer verbal abuse then please disregard my review- it's a pity that such a crappy, rude and over priced place can take such a prime spot in Chinatown singapore. I hope in the future a nicer place will replace this restaurant. Then, myself and family can enjoy a rest there after walking through Chinatown",

The only reason I was there was because my husband's colleagues decided to go there for beer. They drank a lot of it. In fact, they ordered several buckets of large bottles of Tiger beer that the waitress kept filling, so no one actually knew how much they drank!

I know i've been told a lot other places which is far north and in the HDB area, i just never got a chance to try them while i was there. But this one located in Chinatown is good/great enough for a night out, there are many bars' pubs nearby. Easy!!It is a bit touristy, but who cares!! you got the best spot for people watching and a big pint of beer cost only $8\uff1fI've been craving for their chili crab ever since i left Singapore sooooo much :(",

    "text": "Update...The shrimps were either steamed too long or from frozen stock...Have to agree with Phillip and Tommy...we came early around 6 pm for dinner, ordered the large (1.2kg) chili crab (S$72) stream garlic shrimp, fried rice, Singapore rice noodles, scallops and broccoli, everything came luke warm...just wondering if it's a Singapore thing... by the way, each fish came about 5-10 min apart, the shrimp has not arrived after 20 min from the last dish... it's 6:57pm still waiting for the shrimp!",

    "text": "Crocodile in black bean sauce. Whats that you say now? Yes, yes it was. \u00a0 This place is in the middle of Chinatown Singapore. I would like y'all to please remember that Im a tourist, I did kind of touristy things.Ive gotta say I loved the nonchalance about this place. \u00a0Sit down, order 500ml Tiger beer. You WILL need an ice bucket for that. Singapore only has one season. Sweaty. \u00a0A stein like mug. That beer is 5 Singapore bucks. If youre Aussie that about $4.80? how can you go wrong. We went to this venue twice. The first time we sat down because we were absolutely beat from the humid humid weather in Singapore and needed a cold one. \u00a0We didn't eat, but we met a local guy who claimed to own the clothes shop diagonally opposite. Thats the thing about this place, it's kind of like a beer garden, but in a really busy thoroughfare, you can easily meet people. Ex-pats and locals alike. We did our best to blend in, but somehow my Tattoos were always either pitch point for the cunning sales people of the shops here, or a convo point for the local regulars.The food: There was the obligatory fish tanks full of crabs and fish. \u00a0We ordered Scallops with garlic and broccoli and the Crocodile. also special fried rice which to be frank was one of the best Ive had. period. \u00a0Very cheap, Very tasty. I would go there again in a heartbeat it I was ever in town again. Dont be put off by the very casual aspect of this place. I just considered it like a beer garden pub with a very busy frontage.",
