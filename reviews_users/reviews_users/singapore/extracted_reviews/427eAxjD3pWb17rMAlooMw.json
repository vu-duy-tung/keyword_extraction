    "text": "Two times in two weeks... fair to say I like this place! A massive fan of yum cha/dim sum, I thought Singapore would have a tonne of yum cha options with clear favourites to choose from... \u00a0I was right on the quantum of choices however I've found that there are no clear favorites from the locals I speak to. Well let's just say this is my 'claire' favourite so far. The roast pork belly, the duck, the har bao, the char siew pao, the rice wrapped in the banana leaf (name escapes me right now!) and the scallop dumplings are my go-tos. Mmmmm mouth watering at the memory... My gripes? Ask for soy sauce and you get the most miniscule serving to share amongst diners, water is not readily served, and when we turned up with a birthday cake and asked them to bring it out for us later, they just put it right next to the birthday girl about a minute later rather than keeping it hidden away...?Despite my initial concerns that the prestigious location of Raffles might mean a premium on standard dim sum pricing, I was pleasantly surprised to find it fairly 'un'posh and actually quite reasonable. First visit was $30 pp (and way too much food), my recent visit was $20 pp (and I was pleasantly full). Don't expect to dilly dally there for long though... they have two sittings of 75 minutes each so don't be late! They will also ring you about 3 times to confirm your booking (even when I made the booking the day before). All in all, I think this is quality and consistent dim sum.",

    "text": "Oh oh oh, Royal China at Raffles hotel, one would expect that a meal in restaurant located in a hotel so rich in history would be an unforgettable and regal experience... Unfortunately the food was average, the service subpar and the atmosphere nothing special.I called a week upfront for reservations but they had no availability on my first date of choice, nor on the second date so I went with the third date (which was three weeks later). I was surprised to see that the restaurant not completely full.I came for the aromatic crispy duck as I as this was one of my favorite dishes at Chinese joints in London so I was expecting a much better version or at least a good version but the duck was dry and chewy.We also had a few dim sum dishes: fried beancurd roll, har gow and egg custard buns. Since it was the last days of CNY, we could only pick the more upmarket versions (see pictures) as the normal dim sum menu was not available. To me, the dim sum was not bad, the fried beancurd roll was pretty tasty but I did not find them more special than regular dim sum so it was not paying the premium for the CNY versions.The service was just lousy, in general the waitress was unfriendly and snippy, when the dimsum arrived I asked for chili and soy sauce and they gave me soy sauce only, so I had to ask again (why don't they serve it automatically in the first place?). I had to ask for the check three times and when I asked the third time, I got the response: oh, you mean you want to bill (patronizing tone). Maybe \"bill\" might be the term more acceptable in Singapore but: a) if she did not understand the first time, why did she not ask? and b) no need to be condescending, I am assuming that this place is frequented by a lot of tourists so I guess I am not the first one who asked for the check. Additionally we were charged for the dried fruits on the table which we did not touch but honestly I was too fed up by that time to argue over a couple of dollars.As Royal China is located in the Raffles hotel arcade, one would also expect it to have the same atmosphere and greatness of this historic hotel but again, it fails to deliver. Former glory would be the right word to describe it. It looks posh when you first enter but when you look closer you notice that the furniture and decor is not very well maintained. Tip: do not look at the carpet, it is plain filthy.Sorry to say but the only word which comes to mind is: disappointing...",

    "text": "Food is good, but not exceptional. However, we had absolutely horrendous service. The manager himself took the orders for our party of 6. After serving 4 dimsum items, the waitress said that was all that we ordered. We listed the other items which we ordered and she said she will add them in. Again, the items came out short and the manager came back to clarify and we added them again. This happened a total of FOUR times. And each time, there is no real apology and there is a total nonchalant attitude.We simply cannot understand how a restaurant in Raffles hotel can have this level of service. At the end of our meal, we commented that we did not want to pay the service charge. The waitress left with our credit card without saying anything, and returned a box of pineapple patries, but with no waiver of the service charge, nor real apology. No wonder the place is half empty when we settled our check at 1pm on a weekend.Ok, Royal China, I think there are better dimsum restaurants who appreciate our business.",

    "text": "Wow. I started this review on the 10th of September and I still haven't posted it.Well I'm overdue for a review post (it's been A WEEK) so why not work backwards.Caveat: this review is based only on their Sunday dimsum lunch menu.I have no idea what the food's like on any other day or at any other time as all three times I've been here have been Sunday afternoons.I don't get why people say this place is 'posh'. Okay it's in the Raffles Hotel. It's got that posh Tiffany blue. But beyond that the decor's not more posh than other hotel-located Chinese restaurants, and the prices are actually not that expensive.You can pretty much stuff your face (and your belly) at a reasonable $30-40++. And trust me, if I can get full on that amount, you can too.I adore their 'char siew sou'. It's crumbly, buttery, and very addictive. The char siew paus/buns are of course, also good, but if you have to choose, go for the sou (puff). The egg yolk custard buns are mmmmhmm good. They're not for everyone, but I don't know many people that don't like 'em. It's more a matter of are you okay with them or do you LOVE THEM. I love them.The various cheong fun (rice noodle... rolls?) are also delicious and I particularly like the scallop filled ones. If you like prawns, the prawn filled ones are also top notch. The quality of seafood in general is always very good actually.Don't miss out on ordering roasted pork or duck, it's definitely done well, and if you're a group of 4-6, half a duck is just enough for everyone to get 2-3 pieces and still have space for more off the dim sum menu.The porridge here is also decent, though frankly I'd recommend you save the stomach space for more unique items. :)",

When you step n you will feel at ease with the white and blue decor that the restaurant has, compared to other dim sum restaurants which are rather rowdy this one was more classy.I had the usual siew mai and har gao which was really juicy and fresh, the har gao was great with thin skin yet not too soggy. The chee chiong fun is a must have on your menu too with a few options such as the char siew, prawn and scallop all added into one dish on your plate. It was really unique to try all in one bite.Overall i felt the food was ok good and fresh quality, service wise however was on the average side. Had to wait awhile for a few of the dishes we ordered and when they finally arrived the waitress did not apologise or seem sorry at all. I must say the food is still worth a try though.",

I walked very slowly up the stairs: no one wants to go into a posh place and already be sweaty (right?). And of course you slap your forehead and say, Marcus, why didn't you take the lift? Or the escalator? Well, I didn't really look around for them, so I don't really have an smart answer... okay how about I WAS WORKING UP AN APPETITE?On that note, I was suitably hungry when I stepped in, so ordering food was the fun part, and there's SO MUCH GOOD STUFF. they do a pretty good Zhar Leong (you tiao in cheong fun), and all their classics are pretty solid too. Make sure you get the carrot cake (I think there's an XO chilli version available), and the Fu Pei Yun (minced prawn in fried beancurd skin) was awesome too. They did the simple things right, and that meant we were happy, chubby bunnies.Leave with a good taste in your mouth - get the Liu Sha Bao. Here, they flavour their custard with a bit of mango, so there's that sweet/salty finish, which was good enough to remember, and certainly good enough to talk about.For our table of eleven, we ate well, and didn't pay more than $30 a head, and all things considered, I thought that was pretty dang decent.Now I just have to make sure the food coma doesn't affect my memory of where that lift was...",

    "text": "Royal China is a slightly quieter, classier option to the usual bustle at dim sum restaurants. Situated in Raffles hotel, there's an air of tranquility and quaintness as you try to find your way to the restaurant (I still get lost constantly, the hotel grounds make me feel like I've been accosted by time and travelled back to the colonial era).With dim sum starting at just $3.60, the pricing is extremely fair, and flexible -- depending on how many are dining, base prices (always multiples of the number served in the basket) will be adjusted so there will never be one extra siew mai that has to be split three ways e.g. ask for 4 siew mais and pay $4.80 instead of $3.60. The century egg porridge served here is one of the best I've had at the dim sum restaurants in Singapore, tasty and just the right consistency/size. Char siew su is also one of the things they do very well here, a thin honey-glazed skin of flour holds tender sweet-and-savoury char siew, definitely one of the better renditions around.Book ahead to avoid disappointment as they are very popular on weekends or you might find yourself sitting near the doorway if you don't have a reservation. Don't be put off by the seating limitation (they have two seatings for brunch, approximately 1.5 hrs each), it's just the right amount of time, and I really can't see myself not being satisfied after 1 hour here. Service is prompt and food is always served hot, I'd come here any day over Red Star.",

The menu here is extensive, and the fare, delicious. What is most surprising is that the price is actually fair. The egg yolk custard bun is revelatory - oozy salty goodness dripping down your fingers and over the soft fluffy bun. The special cheong fun is very interesting - I haven't had a fried version till now. Also, look out for the specials that are sometimes available. I remember a garlicky pork rib dish that had deep fried curry leaves and chili padi - the fragrance was amazing. Siew mai is not bad, with mushrooms and a single wolf berry adorning the top very prettily. The har gao, on the other hand, is rather pedestrian. Seating takes quite a while, especially if you are coming for the second service. As a result, the front of the restaurant where the reception counter is, gets rather crowded with people milling around. This is especially so on weekends. Still, the robin egg blue hues and pretty decor do serve to calm one down.",

As we entered the restaurant, we noticed the fabric wall coverings were tattered and ripped, and the paint on the ceiling was peeling. We should have been more astute and left before being seated, as it was 7:30 pm on Saturday night and the large dining room was, at most, one-quarter full. We chose a mid range set menu and ordered drinks. The food arrive at a snail's pace and was nothing like the quality we get at a low-end San Francisco restaurants. The abalone's flavor was lost in too much sauce and meat found in a couple of courses was questionable. \u00a0A representative from a local alcohol producer offered free samples table side, then tried to persuade us to purchase the $200 bottle. A large group arrived, turning the staff's attention to them and causing a painful delay in the presentation of our remaining courses. We opted for our check instead of the included dessert and regretted wasting our taste buds at Royal China.",
