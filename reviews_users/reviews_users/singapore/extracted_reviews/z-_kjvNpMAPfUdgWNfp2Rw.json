As a super fan of roasted meat, I tried many places in Australia, China, Honking, Singapore, US etc. - this is simply that BEST of the best I've ever had. The soup is very nice too, and you get to eat some vegetables - so your mom will be happy. Not sure if there;s any public transportation to get there. We came by uber all the time and it worked fine. Avoid peak hours such us lunch hours for a better eating experience if you can.",

I have heard the standard has dropped ever since this place (recipe and all) has been sold and the meat are mostly cooked in a central kitchen. It was not very crowded when I was here after the peak lunch crowd. I forgot what they were famous for (duck? roast pork or char siew?) and just ordered the char siew and roast pork rice ($5) and it came quickly. It was a generous serving of white rice (more than I could finish) with gravy over it. The roast pork was good, with delightfully crispy skin. The meat could be softer though.The char siew was a surprise. The chunky slices were tender and moist with fatty bits at the bottom and sweetly charred on the outside. It was definitely the highlight and I could not remember having something like this anywhere else. So if you can only have one meat, just remember it is the CHAR SIEW which is the must order dish. The prices are similar to food court though the quality is way better at those nondescript run of the mill stalls.",

It is wonderfully fatty, charred, and sweet. You eat it with rice and the sweet sauce that comes with it. I am convinced that bliss can indeed be bought (and eaten).The ambience of the place is un-airconditioned and no-frills, but the char siew makes do for all that is missing. You'd be a fool not to come here.Also, be warned, it wasn't cheap (three meats and rice with a refill of char siew plus drinks for 5, 70$), and it is perpetually crowded. We, a party of 5 came here at 1130 on a Friday for lunch, and golly, it was crowded by 12.",

The skin was not crispy and meat was dry. Some parts of the duck was nice so it seems like the cutter mixed both old and freshly made duck. The roasted pork was similar, some pieces of the pork skin was tough while some was crispy. Luckily the char siew was excellent just like before.The price has gone up, so stick to char siew.Was there on a weekday at 12.30pm, was surprised to be able to get a table (in fact several to choose from).",

The queue still snakes onto the road and there's a mix of army officers (no idea where they came from), office workers, old uncles and aunties and then us the odd young couple out.Then again, there is no discrimination when it comes to roast meat. How can anyone not like the crackling glossy skin of the duck or that buttery melt in your mouth fat that is so irresistible. A soup, 3 kinds of meat and 2 plates of rice cost us $27. Pricey but worth it. The duck may be a little dry but the char siew is to die for. The black caramelized dark sauce is great on the meats and on the rice as well. I absolutely dig the rice which is moist and really fluffy. You must order the char siew. It's fantabulous. The salted veg duck double boiled soup is also a great accompaniment to the meal.",

I'm not sure it's worth quite that much, but their char siu is the best I've had since moving to Singapore, and come to think of it, may be better than any I've had in New York too. \u00a0Every piece is basically half-meat, half-fat, with this perfect burnt-but-not-overly-burnt crust that has just the right amount of salty, sweet glaze. It's ridiculously good. They have all the other usual roast meats and roast duck, but those all seemed fairly average to me. \u00a0You come for the char siu, and you eat an unhealthy, unreasonable amount of it. You'll pay a premium for this goodness, spending ~$15 per person, which is pretty pricey for a portion of roast meat and rice. But in addition to the char siu, you also get to see the owner's equally amazing perm as she chops away. She also tends to yell a lot at her staff, which is pretty entertaining as well.",

The roast duck and roast pork belly are hit and miss really, since I've stopped ordering that when I'm there, just focusing on the char siew and their boiled soups as accompaniments instead.

    "text": "Is Their Char Siew Shop Worth $3.5 Million? Singaporeans should be familiar with this story - The Kay Lee Roast Meat Joint is selling their business for $3.5 million - the amount includes $2 million for the recipe and $1.5 million for the shop space at Paya Lebar. Owners Betty Kong and husband have received bids of up to $3 million, but they will not accept a cent less. Their children did not want to take over the business.I wanted to wait till the hype dies down to find out if this is really worth $3.5 million. On a weekday afternoon at about 2.30pm, there were still about 6-7 people in the queue. The inside of the shop, which looked quite run-down and a blast from the 80s, was fully packed.I could not help noticing that despite being 6th in the queue - it took more than 20 minutes before we could even order our food, partly because people in the front were taking away packets. But more because the lady boss Betty, was cutting their meats really, really, really slow.The meats were indeed very delicious, my favourite being the char siew for being quite original in taste, and tender despite being lean. The roast pork belly is crispy and decent, while the roast duck is on the dry side - it needed the sauce. I actually thought the winning formula is in the combination of three sauces - the dark Hoisin sauce, brownish duck sauce and pinkish sweet chilli sauce that gets passed from table to table.",
