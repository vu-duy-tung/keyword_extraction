    "text": "My uncle took my brother and I to Gayatri to enjoy some Indian food since we don't get much of it back home. We went in on a Monday night at around 6:30 pm. We shared the Butter Dosa, Butter Chicken, Paneer Butter Masala, Appam and the Murtabak (sp?). My favorite was the Paneer Butter Masala and my brother's favorites were the dosa and appam. The service was good. Our waitress was friendly and helped us when figuring out what to order. I actually enjoyed the food so much that I returned the next night to take my grandma to try it. We ordered similar items to the previous night, but also gave a two vegetable dishes a try. I'm not sure what they were called but I didn't care for them. The service was a bit slower than the night before but the restaurant was much busier.",

    "text": "This restaurant's food started out great but fizzled out later. Let me explain.My friend and I ordered two dishes. One small fish head curry and one mutton briyani. \u00a0Both dishes appeared very quickly and the fish head curry was served in an earthen bowl on top of a small gas burner. Very nice.The briyani was excellent and the mutton was not too soft not hard. The spices were sufficient and not overpowering nor over spicy. The fish head curry was also very good with nice amounts of meat on the fish head. I guess the size of the order was the size of the head and not the serving bowl.After about 15 mins of eating, the rice of the briyani became cold and hard which might have indicated the rice was not fresh but reheated. The small burner was slowly evaporating the water and made the curry super salty that made it impossible to continue eating. This made ending the meal disappointing.Service was pretty good but there were times we had to flag down a server for service. Another nice thing was the banana leaf used as a plate. It was a bit of a hit and miss.",

    "text": "Gayatri was highly recommended by my pal who enjoyed Indian Food and during one of the weekends where we were around Serangoon Area, she suggested to show me her favourite Indian Food eating place since young. Out of curiosity, I followed her. I didn't realized that Gayatri is just located by the side of Muthu's Curry Restaurant and good thing about it is that even though the place is crowded, it is less commercialized.We did not make any reservation and was lucky to grab a seat for two. Service was friendly and accommodating.Instead of having plain rice, we ordered Briyani Rice set that comes with 2 vegetables. Empty plates were given to us with chargeable wet tissue.Servers will then go around topping up rice and sides (cabbages & gourds). You can let them know the portion to be placed on your plate without wasting.What's good about ordering like this is that the vegetables are free flow and you are free to request for refill upon finishing them.We requested for chicken as well as fish curry to pair along with our Briyani Rice.Butter chicken was great in its fragrance. The chicken were char-grilled and cooked with garlic, ginger, onion and cashew nut gravy. \u00a0Gravy was luscious and yummy, also a good alternative to pair them with the rice.Butter Chicken - $8.50 (Small)Comes in two sizes, small or large. They were not too spicy and with excellent texture that give full hints of freshness in their Sotong.Sotong Masala - $6.50 (Small)Easing the amount of spice, it will be good to have a cup of Lassi, a popular traditional yoghurt drink. I enjoy the glass of Lassi as they were refreshing and not too sweet.Mango Lassi - $4.50With many of my Indian friends mentioning that Gayatri Restaurant is a better choice, I can't agree further. I hope to be back for more food one day.",

    "text": "I've tried many dishes at Gayatri, and honestly, none of them are worth mentioning. the food is pretty average, and can be a little pricey for what they are serving.The only thing I come for nowadays is the Fish Head Curry, and I normally have that with Briyani rice or just plain rice.I love the fish head curry here. It comes in a large pot, still bubbling, full of spices and amazing herbs. The curry is thick and spicy, with a hint of sourness that balances the whole dish nicely. It also comes with lots of vegetables and pineapples in it.I can tell immediately if a fish head isn't fresh, and I've never had a bad fish head here. The meat remains moist and tasty, and the gelatinous parts of the head area \u00a0real treat.To quell the fire in your mouth, you can have the free flow onion in a yoghurt sauce, or try the mango lassi, which is also pretty good. It's not too sweet, and it takes some of the heat off.They have a promotional price on Mondays and Wednesdays for fish head, so make sure you pop in for that deal!",
