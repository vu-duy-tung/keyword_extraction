    "text": "Tsuru-Koshi, I will admit, was one of those secret places I try not to tell people about because the food is really good and seats are always in short supply when I'm hungry. Selfish, I know. My love for this joint however, has started to waver a little and in my own twisted way of thinking, I'm hoping if more people patronize the shop because they know about it, they'll tighten up the quality standards and everyone benefits.So why do i like Tsuru-Koshi? It's the only udon specialist restaurant that I know of my side of town (it's sad but true, but that's the crabby restaurant landscape in Singapore). It seems like a classic Japanese restaurant transplant that I imagine had some amount of quality control done by the OCD Japanese owner or his Singaporean equivalent. The noodles have always been cooked on the cusp of al dente and the tempura items fried crisp. Lastly, the prices are decent given where the restaurant is located and the portions for quality.What's wrong now? The restaurant is still by far the only means for me to get remotely Japan-standard udon in Singapore, short of going to one the high end places worthy of a business lunch. This place wouldn't stand out in Japan by any means, but for Singapore, it's great. However, on a visit yesterday, I noticed the cooks have become sloppy. The Asu Asu Tan Tan udon I normally order came in a little mess of a bowl - with the minced meat chucked to one side, the noodles un-artfully dunked in and the soft egg broken. The tempura sides we ordered - pumpkin, ebi and the fish cake tubes - left oily kisses on the tenshi. The latter is a cardinal tempura sin in my book. If I wanted a sloppy fry-up, I'd head to Smith's.So yes, this review is strange in that I am none too pleased about what's happening in the kitchen. But, the udon still beats the competition by far. So do me a favor, stop by and grab a bowl or two regularly and tell them to step it up, please? Or tell me if you know of any worthy alternatives.",

Prices are NETT.The broth was a little on the salty side but hey, it's good value. Do note that the place is NOT free seating, so they claim.You're supposed to place your order at the cashier and then be allocated seats.Good luck having their staff enforcing this though.We were waiting for our seats when another party of 2 and 4 who also placed their order just sat down on the just vacated tables. Staff made no effort to get them to requeue.Now, maybe it's because another table cleared up in time and we still got our seats within the following 5 minutes , but what's the point of having such a policy if no one is gonna enforce them? Perhaps this incident is a one off and happened because the manager was not around and their staff were either elderly or with special needs and thus were not equipped or confident to deal with such cases.Final VerdictFood Value: 5/5Food Quality: 3/5Service: 2/5Total: 3/5",

    "text": "One of the stalls in the Takashimaya Food Hall. I had the tonkotsu udon with char siew and kariage. The soup was very satisfying. The char siew was tasty and had two bones which were tiny but I would prefer the char siew to be boneless. The kariage was crispy and the shrimps were fresh. Serving was not very big but enough to fill the stomach. One thing to note is that you have to order first before being directed to a table. This is probably to prevent customers from hogging a table. Haha.",

The food was presented well and the salmon sashimi looked and tastes fresh. The tempura didn't come with any tempura sauce which was a little upsetting and the udon was pretty tasty though I suspect it was mainly MSG as I felt quite thirsty after that.",

The cold one is especially great for a hot afternoon. Simple pleasures.",

I've stuck to noodle bowl + onsen tamago ever since. Forget authenticity; this is not the place for it. But I can't stand soft noodles, and I don't need to worry about that here. Now can we have more fixins, please?",

    "text": "Tucked inside the food hall of Takashimaya basement is Tsuru-Koshi, an udon specialty store. The udon soup variety here is great with the normal soup base, dried fish soup base and something known as the chinese hot sauce which is a little like zha jiang mian. The last time I got the kitsune udon which was not bad, though the tan-tan men which is the one with the chinese hot sauce, is better. My friend had the cream soup base and enjoyed it, although I did not like the creaminess of it. The service by the auntie at the counter is very friendly and warm, and we received our noodles quickly. The price is inexpensive, at about $6.50 to $9 for a bowl, hence being incredibly affordable compared to other foods around the area. It is a simple, no-frills place to eat at expensive Orchard Road and a delicious option too.",

So it is more of a mid afternoon snack or a light meal. And a much healthier option compared to the other fried snacks that are sold in the takashimaya food hall!",

My only complaint is that for 9 bucks, I was expecting more noodles. It's a good size for most girls in Singapore I think. And the egg was pretty good.
