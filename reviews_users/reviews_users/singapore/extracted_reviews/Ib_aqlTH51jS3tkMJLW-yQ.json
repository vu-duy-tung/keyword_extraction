    "text": "We came here being quite disappointed with the Indian cuisine available around other popular eateries in the island. We had heard good things but were worried that it would also turn up in disappointment.We were very pleasantly surprised. This is exactly what we were after, and not only at a reasonable price but with fantastic service.The flavours were not bland at all, but rich and very aromatic. The level of spice was great, not too overwhelming but rather enough to complement the food.We will definitely be visiting again, and expect that we will be visiting regularly throughout our stay in Singapore.",

Chinese dishes cooked with Indian spices, extremely difficult to find even in India and certainly outside); moderate prices; Halal-certified. You'll be spoiled by the different varieties of dosa and biryanis. Not terribly refreshing, but surprise, surprise - one of the most flavourful Indian food in Singapore! Even if you don't plan to shop at Mustafa, worth a trip!",

It is in a really strategic location I have been here once and this is your typical grab and go Indian food. I highly recommend it if you are in a rush. It is the right place to satisfy an Indian food craving. The place is not too shabby. The kabobs are actually quite good it does taste better than how I had it in the USDrawback: the food is a bit on the medium price side. It doesn't fit well. The food gets cold easily so please get it while it's hot. This place can feel real empty. I was expecting a really lively place bur the reality shows me that it's not that good.",

First, we were really excited to be exploring Little India and especially Mustafa Centre going - with all the endless goods available within. Second, we were both craving some form of Indian-influenced-cuisine and got ourselves through the Mustafa maze to the entrance of Kebabs n Curries the moment they opened at 11 am for lunch.We wanted to try the buffet based on the previous Yelp review but was advised by one of the servers that it would take an estimated 30 minutes to 1 hour before it would be ready. Famished people don't wait...that's a fact...so ala carte it is!I wanted to be more excited about the food but it was a rather disappointing $50 meal.Paired with the runs and rather bland flavors...I'd say skip this place altogether and go for one of the mom-pop shops in the area instead. Oh yeah, if this is how bad ala carte gets...I can only wonder if their buffet standards have also dipped since the previous review.Yelp 100: 23/100",

I like the curries - both indian and pakistani. \u00a0The Biryani platter is good value for money too.Try the tea at the end of the meal.

There is an indoor and outdoor area - where the open wooden deck overlooks the bustling Little India street. Food wise, the menu is dominated by North and South Indian staples. The mango lassi ($3) garnished with dried coconut sprinkles is one of the best in town. Other good things to try would be the garlic and butter naan, or tandoor spiced chicken on skewers.

My auntie had this spicy chicken and veggie dish which was just too oily. The taste was there, but damn that excess oil killed it. The price was also pretty reasonable. I did enjoy the environment though. Its on the rooftop and the fans provide a nice little breeze. But I think if it were any hotter outside it would be a little unpleasant to eat spicy curry and be in a hot restaurant with leather chairs. Not pretty!",
