    "text": "Can't believe that I forgot to review this when I had been going here for quite some time already. iO is definitely a hidden gem in the Hillview neighbourhood, but once you tried it, you would feel that the long travel there is all worth it.iO serve various italian offerings with some Chef Specials that is rotated every once in a while. My recommendation from their menu would be the meatballs and eggplant parmegiana for starters. They tasted really great that I have always ordered them whenever I'm around. Another thing you should get would be their pastas. Their pastas are just really good and I don't think it's commonly offered in other western restaurants here in Singapore. Other than that, you should try their Chef Specials. They are significantly more expensive than other offerings but it was well worth the price.If you happen to have a sweet tooth, maybe it's wiser to come down on weekends since they have more selections of desserts on weekends. Price, I would say were quite steep. However, it was all justified by the responsive and cheery staff (never before I encountered staff that would still make small chats with you in SG despite how busy it was), chef that actually bothered to go around and ask us about our opinions, great food and ambiance. Overall, I am happy to give this place a 5 stars. Good thing to note (as I believe others have reiterated countless times) is to reserve your seats beforehand, they're pretty busy around dinner time!",

I always have the pig's ears pasta for lunch here with colleagues, and have had a taste of other pasta dishes and appetizers here. While you can't go wrong with fried seafood or bruschetta with truffle paste, the food here is safe and on the pricey side.Meat and fish mains come up to about $30-$40 which I feel is pricey for the location which is very out of the way. Now that HillV2 has stopped their shuttle bus from my office to their mall, I doubt I'll be popping by on purpose for my Italian fix.",

I would not recommend iO Osteria where so-called \"friendly\" waiters are deceitful in conveniently leaving off the price of a dish 3x more expensive than the dish we were about to order. There are better authentic Italian restaurants in Singapore that do not have to resort to such tactics to stay afloat!!!",

I was there on a Saturday night and it was full (so be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointments!). You can choose to order the pastas on the menu or opt for classics by telling them what you want. I would highly recommend the pesto pasta (not on the menu) which consists of generous servings of pesto sauce and parmesan cheese. Service was pretty good and I would highly recommend this place!",

The seared snapper was also solid, and next time, I would love to try some of the meat dishes as well. \u00a0There is a short wine list, with an interesting choice for house wine, where a full liter will run you only $48. \u00a0While it doesn't drink like a fine barolo, it's a great bargain, although I wish \u00a0they wouldn't chill the red wine. \u00a0Overall, while the prices may not seem very cheap, the portions are generous, especially when compared to my fave - Osteria Mozza. \u00a0Definitely worth a visit and also with a larger group!",

The ceiling to floor windows help greatly with making the place appear big, and inviting. The place is always full, lending a nice 'bustling' atmosphere. Despite this, the staff are all attentive and very friendly, with the owner and chef helping out with front of house from time to time.I personally recommend sticking to the 'street' type food - the pizzas and breads are good, especially the schiacciata. The starters and pastas are decent. The only secondi we ever tried over several visits really disappointed us and resultantly, have stayed away from them. So far desserts have been hits and misses! Generally a relaxed place to have a casual meal with friends.",
