    "text": "Probably the awesome reviews here on Yelp set a high expectation. In short, good food (not great), horrible service, and loud ambience. The started off on the wrong foot. We got there right at the time of our reservation, we were asked to wait, and after some time we are told that because they have too many reservations they are giving us a table in their other restaurant next door (Masa) where we could order of of their menu. We go to the place next door, and again we are asked to wait. This time, slight better, because they invite us to seat at the bar to wait... The bar attendant stares at us and ignores us... Even after we greet her. Guess what we want, you genius? \u00a0Ask yourself what do people at the bar usually do... Manage to order two beers somehow. We are seated. The table setup is awkward. It's one of those typical, nice Japanese private booth. But it split in two right in the middle with a flimsy curtain, which lets you see through some and lets you hear everything happening at the other side or the table--not hard, since they are seating inches from you...The appetizers are typical Japanese, but ruined by some Chinese influence. \u00a0For example, classic Japanese chilled tofu with soy, and addition of deep fried onion on top, just to mention one. The meat is awesome, and that's the only reason to come to this place. Not cheap, definitely. \u00a0Everything, but the meat, will take ages, so be prepared...",

    "text": "If you're thinking that only in Japan you can satisfy your yakiniku cravings, then freight not! Yazawa is easily the number one spot in Singapore to satisfy your yakiniku cravings. Although its abit pricey, the quality of the beef easily makes up for the cost. YES, it is that worth it and YES, it is THAT good. Never did I expect to eat yakiniku of this quality in Singapore. It's just as good as the ones in Japan. Worth to go during special occasions and a definite must try.My family of 3 paid about 160 per pax for about 7 different servings of beef together with one soup and a salad. Trust me, it is not recommended that you order too much meat, as the meat is very savory and will get very 'gelat' if too much of it is eaten. Aim to order about 120-130 per pax. Food such as this is best enjoyed in smaller quantities.I highly recommend ordering the wagyu steak and at least 2 servings of it. Its easily the best dish of meat you can get there. The level of marbling on the steak is truly amazing. The words 'it literally melts in your mouth' holds very true here. The last time i had such an experience was with fatty tuna belly in Tuskiji fish market all the way in japan. Aside from that, the dish i recommend would be my personal favorite, ox tongue! The meat is both chewy and soft at the same time, giving it a unique texture which i really enjoy.",

    "text": "So a friend brought me here because she said it was the best place to have beef.... and oh boy was she right.Just you know, this place is expensive. It's as expensive as having a meal at Cut or Mortons. But I have to say that the quality is just as good or even better. Yakiniku they call it - this was my first time having it. I ordered the Yukke to share as appetiser. Aesthetically it is an automatically eye pleaser! It's hard not to whip out your hp just to take a picture of this beauty! It's raw marinated beef with a perfect yolk in the centre. It tasted very fresh and was the gateway for more great things to come! At this point of time we started to get even more hungry! The waitress was pretty helpful and patient in explaining and recommending the different cuts for us. In the end we settled for Zabuton (short rib), Jo Kalbi, Tenderloin, and beef tongue. I'll admit it.. I enjoyed them all! I love beef. The colours of the marbling even before it's cooked is enough to send you to cloud 9! As you place it on the grill for only a few seconds, you can see how the fat bubbles off the meat and melts and cooks so evenly! BOOM. It's like heaven in your mouth. Being a guy, I also need my rice! And the rice here for 3bucks a bowl was definitely worth mentioning. Good quality indeed!The waitress will also come by quite a number of time to change your grill to a new one too! Very impressed with that! Being my first time here with really good meat, I didn't try much of the sauces as I really wanted to take in all that bovine goodness! But I can tell you that even if you used any... U really didn't need to use any of the condiments much at all! If it weren't so expensive... Id give it a full 5stars! But I can at least see why it costs so much. I think maybe I've found a new place to come to instead of the usual Cut or Mortons if I'm craving really high quality steak. Definitely not a place you'd come every other month for people like me but if you enjoy your beef or wanna impress a chick who loves beef for her birthday or a special occasion... THIS WILL NOT DISAPPOINT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Oh and I just remember one slight grievance... They do tend to seem like they're rushing you out a bit the minute u finish everything and don't seem to be ordering anymore. I think they could improve a bit more on that to try to at least be a little more discreet given that I spent practically $200 per person in the span of under 90mins!",

    "text": "ever had that inspiration to immediately start writing a review when you are still dining at a restaurant?my yakiniku yazawa experience was just that!call it first time first love.but i'm sure this place will stand the test of time in our relationship.service was really attentive and they actually anticipated your needs even before you ask for it.a pair of scissors magically appeared when they saw that we were struggling to cut them udon with fork and spoon.quick presentation of food upon ordering and quick clearing of empty plates as and when the moment presents itself.clear explanation of the different cuts also helped a lot in making informed choices. even the chef personally made the rounds to check up on us.for a yakiniku place, it sure is way less smoky than i anticipated.their top notch extraction system is key!as soon as smoke forms at the grill it gets whisked away without even reaching table level.here, smoke never gets in your eyes!the quality of meat is class indeed.the instruction of a recommended mere 5sec grilling per side is testament to how good their meats are.if looks could kill, their raw meats will at the very least get you drooling!pure and simple shio instead of tare seasoning will further maximize your enjoyment of their premium cuts.no kobe here but their wagyu is decadent enough.the japanese wagyu trumped the australian, needless to say.both very well marbled but a more intense taste from the jap.but the price of the jap is also more than double that of the oz.tongue is always a favourite of mine and here it does not disappoint.the japanese wagyu cubed superior cuts of various parts gives more bite and stronger concentration of flavours.ala carte side dishes distracts but at the same time completes your meal here.the gyuniku tataki is a real delightful combination of colour, taste, and texture.the maitake mushrooms, our token vegetable dish, are sweet with just a hint of chilli.and for some strange reason you require carbo fillers, they do a mean hot udon noodles served with stewed wagyu and also a minced wagyu beef japanese style curry rice with sunny side up.no lingering smoky smells but lingering memories remain.can't wait for our second date!:)",

    "text": "Our new favourite yakiniku joint.The meats were exquisite, even if the meat-centric menu was decidedly limited. Unlike Aburiya, Gyu Kaku or Ito-Kacho, there isn't a variety of seafood, or vegetables to break up the monotony of regular meats like beef, pork and chicken. Most meats are marinated with tare, or shio. I personally prefer tare seasoning, it's got a little more dimension than just salt & pepper.There's just 2 types of beef, all wagyu of course, of Australian breed, or the in-house proprietary brand Yazawa beef. The Australian wagyu is a little more tempered, whereas the Yazawa beef is extremely marbled. If you prefer your meats with a little more body, I suggest you take the Australian wagyu over the very rich Yazawa beef.Note that there's a 2-seatings for dinner policy, which the service staff will inform about when taking reservations, and/or also while seating u. On the upside: service was akin to a Korean-style barbecue, where u needn't bother with the grilling because the wait staff will be on hand to do so.We had:1) Edamame ($8): ridiculously expensive, but they were fat and juicy, beautifully seasoned with sea salt, and served refreshingly icy.2) Tori Momoniku ($16): bite-sized morsels of juicy chicken thigh marinated in tare sauce. Must-try.3) Mangalica Pork ($22): delicious slivers of chuck roll simply seasoned with shio (salt) & pepper so as not to detract from the natural sweetness of the meat4) Ton Toro ($16): medium-thick cuts of pork neck glazed with tare. These were so awesome, we had like 5 plates between the 3 of us. For sure a cannot-miss.5) Australian Wagyu Jo Kalbi ($28): premium chuck rib cut, steeped in tare. This had a fuller flavour, while exquisite threads of fat lent succulence.6) Yazawa Beef Misuji ($48): an exceptional precious cut at the corner of the shoulder, mostly because it was more fat than meat. This was glorious and indulgent and sinfully rich.7) Yazawa Beef Rump ($46): a smidge more delicate in marbling, so while it was decadent, it wasn't as heart-palpitatingly so",

    "text": "Yazawa is a Japanese yakiniku place located in Robertson Quay. It's probably my favorite yakiniku place in Singapore. They serve beef of amazing quality, and great side dishes as well.I usually start with a cold chicken ramen. It's nothing like your usual ramen. The noodles is not the usual yellow egg noodle, but it's some sort of jelly-like, chewy noodle. The broth is light, topped with sesame oil & seeds. And instead of chasiu, you have this sliced chicken thigh instead. The combination sounds weird at first, but it's very refreshing and just arouses your appetite for the beef.As said above, the beef that Yazawa serves are of the highest quality. My favorite cut is the Japanese beef shoulder. It is very rare and you should call the shop days in advance to reserve it. They also have the Australian beef version, and while it's decent, it just won't blow your brain like the Jap version. Other than that, the thick beef tongue is just wonderful.Tbh, the other beef that Yazawa serves is great, but it's just not as good as those 2 cuts I mentioned. But you won't be disappointed with the overall yakiniku experience you'll enjoy in Yazawa.",

The tongue and cube steaks are good ones to try as well as the \"3 second\" cuts. The service staff is very helpful and knowledgeable about the cuts, which ones to order and how to cook them. In addition to the melt-in-your-mouth meats, the side dishes are also quite tasty. Our favorites were the Japanese-styled kimchi and the Yazawa (house) salad. The prices aren't cheap, but still reasonably priced given the quality of the meat that is served. All in all a good value and must try for yakiniku aficionados.",
