    "text": "wholesome, chichi, yummy-mummy-abound buffet of antipasti and salads at this cafe in the rather-tough-to-get-to shangri-la hotel (they serve up some fantastic mains too). I have finally made my way to this place, and it couldn't be sooner - the food is light and clean (on the palate; hygiene here taken for granted) and varied in both flavor and color, and there's a relaxing vibe to this place that lends itself to lazy weekend brunches.great service too, and reasonable prices given the quality and type of food served - it's worth the drive/ trek.shangri-la is one of those chains that's sort of familiar and posh without trying too hard - and it always has this languid vibe about it that's rather reflected in this restaurant - filled with lunching ladies in flowing dresses, set by the pool side.the mostly mediterranean-styled food is laid out on a long, gorgeous wooden table - many different flavors and all well-balanced-and-seasoned - but it's a light flavor profile that seems much better suited to women. but to bulk things up, the lunch sets also offer the option of an additional set course - anything from fish to beef.my main courseof \u00a0fish was properly seared - the skin was suitably crispy, the meat flaky, and the little salad on the side of baby carrot and corn was plenty tasty.but you don't need the main course - we were just being greedy - the salads are pretty much sufficient for a satisfying, sating weekend lunch, without any of that usual heft that necessitates a post-meal siesta (though you can still take one, if you're so inclined). delicious food - tastes and feels almost like you're in a leisurely holiday town - well worth the almost unbelievably reasonable price for lunch.",

    "text": "Head on over for a taste of the crisp and refreshing flavors of South Italy over at The Waterfall, Shangri-La Singapore. Chef de Cuisine Marco De Vincentis has curated a refreshed menu with 27 new a la carte creations and six new desserts including homemade pastas, fresh seafood and Southern Italian signatures.Fresh and seasonal produce is the highlight at The Waterfall, using authentic cooking methods and heirloom recipes. We enjoyed the Manzo Black Angus Marinato salad which features marinated Black Angus beef with pine nuts, rocket and pecorino cheese, drizzled with a delectable honey balsamic.Canestrato Pugliese e Pomelo was a refreshing mesclun salad with black olives, canestrato cheese, white balsamic dressing with fresh pomelo wedges for a citrusy tang; The pastas are made fresh at the restaurant and you can pick from one of the 18 different flavors; and there are also egg-, dairy- and gluten-free pastas as well! New highlights include Spaghetti Al Nero Di Seppia, Scampi E Datterini, homemade squid ink pasta flavoured with rich scampi sauce and cherry tomatoes with a hint of chili for added spice. I enjoyed the garlic seafood sauce but the pasta was a tad overcooked imo. For mains, The Baked Pink Snapper was delicious. I loved the sweet firm flesh with a nice golden crust all around and that pretty herbed mashed potato lightly tinted pink with beetroot juice. The caveman sort can go for the Slow-cooked Lamb with verbena-scented celeriac root puree, and Bistecca Alla Fiorentina with rosemary oil accompanied with baked potatoes.Other than the refreshed dessert selection which includes cakes and cookies, there's also a gelato section by Alfero Gelato! Love love love their super intense gelato. You must certainly have the nutty Pistachio, salty sweet Coconut Sorbet, nutty Bacio, and more. There's a special Waterfall flavor that is specially created by Alfero. A la carte dishes at The Waterfall are priced from $14. Expect other Italian favorites of cured meats and artisanal cheeses, as well as handmade pizzas!",

    "text": "It seems the breezy little spot is fast discarding its image as an in-house-guest-only destination, and coming into its own. The Southern Italian fare is excellent; hearty and soulful yet refined. Although the restaurant was a full-house at the revisit, service was surprisingly efficient and gracious.We had:1) Spaghetti alla Chitarra con Ragu di Crostacei ($29) - homemade chitarra pasta laced with shrimp and tossed with garlic, chilli, and extra virgin olive oil, and lemon: it's very saucy, but that's the best part, aside from the swimmingly fresh prawns and perfectly al dente pasta. So good, you'll ask for a spoon to wipe this clean off. 2) Spigola all'Acqua Pazza ($36) - Neapolitan-style seabass served with cherry tomatoes, olives, and capers, in a white wine sauce: exquisite and delicate. I only wished they'd drown this in more of that white wined broth, it was that outstanding.3) Agello Arrosto con Timo e Patate ($36) - roasted lamb rack flavoured with thyme and served with new potatoes and sauteed vegetables: the husband thought it was lusciously cooked, and robust in flavour, I thought it was too full-bodied.4) Sharing Dessert ($32): great sampler of their greatest hits. In descending order of preference, I liked the Tiramisu, Ricotta cheesecake, Biancomangiare, and Profiteroles",

    "text": "If you still recall, I have reviewed the dishes at Waterfall Cafe sometime in August. Today, I brought my sista to make a discovery on their less-known breakfast menu. Naturally, only in-house guests will pop by for a breakfast but we drove our way there intentionally.With a third of the menu presented with egg dishes, I was coaxed into having an egg white omelette by Kelvin who succeeded in uplifting my energy level with a light touch. I would think that the egg Benedicts make a good classic morning dish for most but you could opt for a more refreshing plate with a negligible 17 calories (approx) in each absolute white. I liked the finished egg with a soft curdy interior loaded with confetti mushrooms, fresh tomato dices and a handful of baby spinach. The 2 egg whites melded to form a very consistent texture and fastened with gold trimming that crisped in each mouthful. The opaque mass is made lighter with a less noticeable seasoning. If the notion of a perfect omelette is a moist and tender yield, then this came close except for some traces of slight weeping. Not to worry about the empty spaces in your stomach, it can be easily filled with the accompanying saut\u00e9ed mushroom, a few baked potato wedges, some green salads tossed in vinaigrette; along with 2 crusty toast.For a more elegant egg dish, ask for eggs in varied Cocotte version; Chorizo, Mushroom or Roast chicken that comes with toast as well.If you are game for a eggless morning ritual, then the Pancakes and Waffles make good options, other than Asian selection - Chinese rice congee and Nasi Lemak. Here, I am trying out Buckwheat waffles. Instead of chowing down nothing but a few traditional buttermilk pancakes, these rustic-looking girdle cake not only serves for healthier option but a new wholesome taste. As we know, buckwheat contains no gluten and so it can be quite tacky when buckwheat flour is called for in a recipe. Without ruining the dish, this old-fashioned recipe has evolved into a fashionable fare with crispier outside and a more complex texture. I fear having that intense earthy after-taste often found in the Japanese buckwheat soba, this one was more easy-going. Rather than an airy dough, the buckwheat cake makes a coarse statement with a dense texture. One may frowned at its dull appearance, but the caramelised banana and a swirl of gula melaka make it a toothsome dish. Don't pass up the opportunity to have one.",

    "text": "More reviews at DanielFoodDiary.comOne of Singapore's top hotel, tropical greenery, poolside view, dim yellow lighting, colonial interior, comfy furniture, lovely chocolates and desserts... checked, checked, checked. The mains consist of healthy yet creative and colourful-looking dishes inspired by Mediterranean flavours, created by Chef de Cuisine Stephane Cocu. The Seared Sea Scallops ($24) in hazelnut crust, crushed potatoes, port win jus sets the tone right - light pan-fried, crispy on the outer crust, and fresh and moist on the inside. Easily the most memorable dish of the evening. I had the Atlantic Cod ($38) which is served on barley risotto, an interesting take as most would have been cooked with rice. The barley gives the dish a light sweetness, and has slight foam which adds a more varied texture. Probably two can share this if both are light eaters. Full review: danielfooddiary.com/2012\u2026",

I did find it tough to find Paleo options here, but the place is pretty gluten-free friendly. The ambiance is lovely, especially on the patio in the evening overlooking the pool. The lighting is soft and the fans along with the breeze make it pretty cozy. The place is a bit pricey, but if you're staying at the hotel and looking for something convenient, Waterfall Cafe hits the spot.",

Well, the Waterfall Cafe have certainly managed to work out the kinks. The slow-baked veal cheek and grilled Iberico pork chop together with Parma ham and chorizo that I had certainly made me realize that eating healthy isn't impossible, just pricey. But I have to say, it's worth every cent you spend here. Not only is the food good and healthy, you get to enjoy a pleasant balance of class and casualness that the Shangri-La is renowned for. A great place to have a first date.",
