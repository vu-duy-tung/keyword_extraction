    "text": "I've eaten at this cozy place on Killiney Road so many times that I'm surprised I haven't written a review yet. The food is delicious, especially the rendang chicken. It's spicy, but not enough to scare me away. Following the Paleo lifestyle \u00a0doesn't allow me to use rice to help with the heat, so I'm always sure to grab a lime juice and a water. They've got many different kinds of chicken to choose from, and also have a rendang beef that I still need to try. They've also got a variety of cooked vegetables, gravy and fried eggs to round out your meal. I found this place a bit intimidating when we first moved because I was going to have to order at the counter and try to pronounce some of the names of these dishes, but have no fear--pointing seems to work just fine for me!",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday evening, for two, place was rather empty, so just order, grab a seat, and they will bring the food to you. There are no freshly made drinks except lime cordial, so I guess it was between lime cordial and teh botol.We got rice and a few things to share: Assam fish, beef rendang, sweet potato leaves, fried tempeh, and deep fried hard boiled eggs. Man, the food here is SALTY! I would rate everything here as average, and the sweet potato leaves were quite old, and also dripping with salt. Tempeh was over fried and slightly burnt, and the Assam fish was nice and spicy, but was let down because they used poor quality catfish that was inherently salty, which brought down the dish despite its great sauce. The saltiness of everything here was quite evident to us on our extra order of rice, given both of us aren't huge rice eaters. The cost came up to about 30 for two of us. I don't think I'd come back, my hunt for great and inexpensive Indonesian food will probably continue...",

    "text": "I second what Yelper Lyna Y. wrote - everything I ordered was on the salty side. I do like the food as it has a hint of the homestyle smokiness or rempah in the dishes. Unfortunately the saltiness just marred the whole meal as I needed to eat plenty of rice just to tone it down. The chicken rendang is definitely one of the better ones around as the chicken is still moist and not hard and dry. I do like the decor with its posters of Marilyn Monroe and other famous stars of the yesteryear. Then you get a bit of museum feel with old Peranakan style tiles motifs on chairs and around the restaurant. Packets of crackers hanging from the ceiling to be sold. An old ice kacang machine sitting on top of a shelf. Pretty nostalgic.",

Now, good rendang is hard to come by in Singapore and I must say I was quite disappointed. The rendang sauce was salty and lack spiciness. The cut of beef was too lean and dry. Hajah Maimunah at Jln Pisang is a much better deal.",

    "text": "Opened by and named after Malaysian singer M. Nasir, Warong M Nasir is a cozy little eatery that is worth raving about. The high ceiling, wooden furniture and well-lit setting create a warm and welcoming ambience. With a wide display of kuehs and other dishes, I decided to go with the one that looked the most appealing - the Nasi Padang. One cannot help being drawn to the spread of nasi padang dishes. What I remember to be the most outstanding is the beef rendang, with a perfect balance of spices forming an amazingly fragrant dish. Other recommended dishes include sayur lodeh, tauhu telor, and tapioca plant. For the brave-hearted, you can try the ox tongue, which has an acquired taste and texture and definitely does not appeal to everyone. Those with a low tolerance for hot and fiery fare will be up for a challenge, seeing that they are that generous with their spices. However, just eat the dishes with the generous portion of steam rice served and there should not be a problem.",

The ingredients (shallots, chilli peppers, lemon grass, turmeric, coconut, and galangal and meat) are simmered for up to four hours for the meat to soak up the goodness of the spices, and the result? Tender chunks of beef (or chicken, goat, or lamb!) that are just unforgettably oh-so-yummy.",

It's a standard self-service restaurant with interesting art d\u00e9cor and a variety of traditional nasi padang dishes (on the pricey side, but never more than $12 for food and drink) on display. \u00a0 I generally come here during off-peak hours such as weekends and evenings and order my standard sayur lodeh (vegetable curry), begedil (potato) and a fried egg - simple but delicious. When I'm bored with that routine, I add chicken curry, rendang or fish to my dish. Be warned though, it can get pretty spicy!I top my meals off with a teh o peng that's actually pulled pretty well and not too sweet. They also sell 'teh botol' - the diabetes-inducing sweetened tea drink from Indonesia that I love dearly. Being half Indonesian-Chinese (trying to gain street cred here) I can say that this place is one of the better Indonesian restaurants in Singapore. I tend to avoid it after 8pm though, as all the good dishes are usually sold out by then and the offerings are meagre.",

The place is distinctively balinese in decor, painted in warm inviting hues of dark tangerine and has various paintings hanging off the wall that you can purchase. But the food is really what is so stellar about this place. The minute you step in, you are greeted by an array of dishes tucked into a two-level glass cabinet - tangy assam fish, rich sayur lodeh, pan-fried brinjal strips with sambal. Absolutely spoilt for choice and so far, none of the dishes have ever disappointed me. Wash down this rich and comforting meal with a cup of iced teh botol, a sweet and fragrant jasmine tea popular in Indonesia and you will feel all set for a nap.",
