The interior is decorated in a comfy French bistro feel. Service is good. Food here is generally good and fault-free, if a little boring, but one comes here for classic bistro fare. Prices run a bit high, but a place so convenient right in the middle of town, with generally good food- it's nice here.It's not super romantic, but it will do.",

    "text": "This used to be a great place to get lunch, with dishes that did not compromise and served very French, traditional food at an unbeatable price. I hadn't been for a year or two and booked it out of memory for the sheer reliability of the place.Sadly the menu has been noticeably thinned, as have the portions. Some of the cooking is still there, but the spirit seems gone. The chicken consomme on the other hand was a bit of a joke, like getting the soup with your chicken rice from the local hawker, except with a quarter as much chicken flavour (if all you are serving is clear soup it should, at least, be flavourful). The menu items generally have gone from great but locally more challenging Escoffier-ish French bistro food to the same popular steak and fries you can get anywhere (at a premium too). The classic bacon stew in a Creuset pot is gone for good, and sides now cost more than dessert used to, instead of being included.The price has jumped to an incredible 40++ for 3 courses, which puts it above Gunther's which is (French, not Singaporean) Michelin star worthy (the RSW Sentosa Michelin Guide is not really a Michelin guide). The wine prices are on par with fine dining places like Whitegrass or Jaan; but the tables have no white tablecloth to justify the premium.I should say the service is as good as it's always been. That part hasn't changed.I do not know what has happened at the Les Amis group but I have other options for a French lunch and will exercise them rather than return. BdV of old, you will be missed. On the upside, congratulations on a website that now works.",

You may come here after a day of shopping and it still feels like you are in some quaint, little alley with the dark red facade that you see in Paris. The braised beef cheek and duck confit are my favourite. The braised beef cheek has this home-cooked flavour comes in the creuset pot. The duck confit comes with tasty mashed potato that you will indulge in even though you are pretty much filled to the brim. The coq au vin was just an average dish to me. Service was exceptional that night that I went to celebrate my friend's birthday. They kept pouring drinks before we asked for water. I personally think it is commendable in Singapore. We didn't order dessert that night, we will be back for sure but I am not sure when.",

The stews are generally lovely and the specials (once you'd gone through the standard menu) are what makes the trip exciting.

The desserts were creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, hazel parfait and the choc tarte with raspberry sorbet. \u00a0All fantastic! \u00a0 And the set lunches came with cuppacino not one of those house blend coffee. \u00a0So all in all a fabulous lunch and the sleepy spell is kicking in again. \u00a0Oh yes....since i work around here there is this senior gentlemen that sits and the corner seat everyday so perhaps the quality control boss",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner date at Bistro du Vin.First, I want to say that I am pretty confident this is a restaurant that would normally warrant more than two stars. \u00a0Sometimes, the stars do not align and I have to review the experience I had.We arrived for our 8 pm reservation. \u00a0We were told we could sit where we would like. \u00a0The restaurant was considerably less than half full. \u00a0We selected a four top. \u00a0We had presents to unwrap. \u00a0Plus, we usually order lots of food.Our server came over and told us we had to sit at a two top . First, he was insistent. \u00a0When I stated the restaurant was less than half full, he finally acquiesced. \u00a0 Frankly, this is not what one expects at a restaurant of this caliber. If this had been the only set-back, I would probably of noted it but not overly factored it in. \u00a0But, it wasn't.After we were seated, we looked at the menus for quite some time. \u00a0I decided on a wine and set the wine menu aside. \u00a0We decided on our food & placed our menus aside. \u00a0Early on, we were brought water. \u00a0However, quite a bit of time passed before our server approached the table to take our order. \u00a0Our food order was taken at the same time as our wine order. \u00a0Once again, if this was isolated I would have chalked it up to the server just giving us some time opening opening presents.The restaurant is quaint with a very casual feel. \u00a0There are lots of art pieces on the wall supporting the French themes. \u00a0It's a nice comfortable room.At times, the service was good. \u00a0However, as noted, there were issues and there were lapses.The food ranged from inedible to very good.Complimentary Bread - There was a warm sliced French bread supplied with butter. \u00a0We liked it. \u00a0We liked it a lot. \u00a0We liked it to the tune of two refills.tinyurl.com/b5pvblbMussels - We were initially going to have one of the charcuterie options. \u00a0However, when we saw the mussels on the specials board, we changed our minds. \u00a0More accurately, she changed our minds. \u00a0These were some of the best mussels I've had in Singapore. \u00a0They were simple. \u00a0The mussels themselves had a very clear straight from the ocean appeal. \u00a0The only real negative was there was very little broth.tinyurl.com/ahrh246Baked Burgundian escargots (6 pieces) with garlic herb butter - These were also good. \u00a0As escargots often are, they were served piping hot. \u00a0The herbs were overpowering though. \u00a0There was very little of the delicate flavour of the escargots remaining. \u00a0They had really just become a textural spoon for the garlic herb butter.tinyurl.com/bjldev6Lamb Shank (slow-cooked with white onion, cherry tomatoes confit & crushed potatoes) - My dinner companion ordered the lamb shank. \u00a0I tried the lamb. I found it to be quite bland. \u00a0She used the term \"not bad\" to describe it. \u00a0The presentation was rustic home-style. \u00a0tinyurl.com/atg5ftbCoq au vin (braised in red wine, with carrot, mushroom, pearl onion, bacon & mashed potato) - This was a reasonable interpretation of the dish. \u00a0As you expect, the chicken was extremely tender. \u00a0The mushrooms & pearl onions were the stars though. \u00a0The first brought earthiness and the second brought sweetness. \u00a0In the pantheon of my experience with coq au vin, this would fall directly in the middle. \u00a0The whipped potatoes were a nice addition.The presentation was very much inline with the rustic expectations of coq au vin.tinyurl.com/au4kvqqSouffl\u00e9 au Grand Marnier with vanilla ice cream - This dish has a twenty minute wait. \u00a0We eagerly awaited its arrival. \u00a0In a little over twenty minutes, it was brought to the table. \u00a0However, immediately, we could tell there was something wrong. \u00a0There was a strong smell of scrambled eggs. \u00a0Upon tasting it, the only flavour was that of slightly overcooked scrambled eggs. \u00a0We did not eat it. \u00a0We did eat the ice cream. \u00a0I do not know how a chef could not have smelled the tremendously overpowering smell of eggs. \u00a0This is one of the top three things that can go awry with a souffl\u00e9. \u00a0It should have been spotted in the kitchen. \u00a0This dessert should have never made it to the table.It did look very pretty though.tinyurl.com/beturaqReceipt ($274.24):tinyurl.com/avtksn6When it came time to get the bill, we waited for awhile. \u00a0We did not see our server. \u00a0We finally had to flag a different server. \u00a0After providing my card, someone returned to my table and explained that \"all credit card access in Singapore was down\". \u00a0 They said they could place the charge at a later time. \u00a0However, I had cash and decided to simply pay.Overall, the food was inconsistent. \u00a0It did not always meet my expectation of a fine French bistro. \u00a0Plus, the dessert was inedible. \u00a0There were hiccups in the service. \u00a0I do think it may have just been an off-night. But I have no way of knowing and I do not plan on returning to find out.",

Started with the pan fried foie gras (a top up of $6) and the duck rillette. The foie gras was a little overdone, and the duck rillette is tasty, but I am just not much of a duck rillette person. It reminds me too much of spam.Main courses were the ribeye (the daily special and a top up of $10) and the sea bass. I like the ribeye much better than the sea bass, which was much too oily.Dessert - have the crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It has vanilla bean in it and it wasn't too sweet and the perfectly thin and crisp caramelised top. The poached peach with lemon sorbet was a cheap shot. The peaches were the canned fruits and not fresh poached peaches. I felt cheated.I guess the lunch deal is a good value deal but I would probably go ala carte next time, or go for dinner where there seems to be more daily special choices.",

Checkered table clothes, waiters donning aprons, the unpretentious menu... it's almost like they airlifted this off a sidewalk in the chic district Montmartre in Paris!Over here at the Bistro, they dish up a mean, solid portion of fries. Straight-cut and cooked to a light golden brown, and as thick as your thumb, each bite delivers crisp, lightly salted skin and moist, steaming potato mush. These fries are delectable and divine, but those hoping for dips or seasonings will be disappointed as not much more is done besides some light salting, but they make a great accompaniment to the tasty broth in their Coq au Vin (rooster stewed in red wine sauce).",

The atmosphere is the same of that of a humble taverne and so are the prices. But the food...simply amazing!Simple food prepared to perfection. My favorite is the chicken which is cooked so tender that it melts on your tongue.They have a lunch set which is also valid during the weekend, which goes for around $35 dollars for 3 courses.

    "text": "The escargots were fine but their duck confit was disappointing. Very very disappointing. I do like the decor of this place though. Nice and cosy. Their service staff are polite and attentive too (well trained and was able to suggest a suitable wine to pair with the food). But their rather lacklustre main and dessert just doesn't really warrant their price and hype. May just be a really off day for their food but it will take a lot of convincing for me to return for their dinner.",

    "text": "Bistro Du Vin is a classical French restaurant that specializes in French cuisine. The setting is that of a typical French bistro; being there gives me the feeling of being transported to France. The set lunches are at a reasonable price of $30++ per person, and each set lunch comes with an appetizer, main course and dessert. There are 6 items each for appetizer, main course and dessert to choose from. I picked the pan-seared foie gras with pickled shallots and eggplant for starters and it was heavenly. The foie gras was marvelously caramelized on the outside and yet the inside melts in your mouth when you bite into it. The sourness of the shallots also complemented the dish by making it more appetizing. For mains, I had the French Duck Leg Confit. The skin was perfectly charred and crispy while the meat was juicy and succulent. It is one of the better Duck Confits I have tasted. The portion of the serving was also just right.Finally, came the Cr\u00e8me Brulee, which was light and fluffy. The caramel one top was slightly burnt which added a bitter taste to the dessert. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. The meal was really worth the money and the service was great as well.",

    "text": "Bistro Du Vin, the one restaurant which made me fall in love with french food all over again. The experience was entirely amazing. Having been to Paris myself, I know exactly how the ambience of a cute little parisian restaurant is supposed to feel like and my, how they replicated it well. Everything that they served as bursting full of flavour, from the huge and meaty simmered pork leg to the fresh and warm french bread that crackled beneath our finger tips as I broke off bits of it. I particularly found the stewed beef delicious. The way the meat just melted on my tongue into a mouthful of flavour was absolutely blissful. As a Burata cheese connoissuer, however, I must say that I was rather disappointed when they served our order of Burata cheese in a small dish, cut up and mixed with oddly cut tomatoes and rocket salad. It did not come in the usual generous portions that other restaurants serve it as. In that sense, I found it quite unsatisfying. But apart from that, the dining experience was just lovely. The waitress suggested just the right amount of food for us, leaving us full, but not bloated, with well cooked food.",
