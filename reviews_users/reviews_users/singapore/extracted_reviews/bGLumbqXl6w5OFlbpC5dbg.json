    "text": "This is a good food court, largely due to the location in East Coast Park on the beach. This food court is mostly known for their seafood and probably satay. There is a large seafood selection from many stalls with an assortment of preparation styles, and one whole side of the area has stands with separate satay grilling stations. Unfortunately, other than seafood and satay, your selection is pretty limited, there are other options but the selection and variety is limited.The seating does tend to be full most times so you will need to spend some time looking around for your seat.The stalls are a bit aggressive as you walk by, but I didn't see anyone harassing anyone at the tables.",

Come with a group, split up and grab your food from different stalls, and then hunt down a table to enjoy the feast together.",

Yes, food is the stuff of my dreams. Many families spend their weekends here, first cycling/roller blading, playing in the sand, picnic-ing (yes, also eating) or what nots, and finish up with a fabulously sumptuous dinner here by the beach. Mine was no different, and I spent many weekends growing up here, eating up a storm, with sand still between my toes. Over the years, the place has seen a number of facelifts (thankfully), and cleaners hustle about cleaning up tables so you can get a seat relatively quickly. Some of the stalls have been around for ages - places like Haron Satay (stall 55) rank among my dad's top five satay stalls across the country, and I remember the same old man fanning the embers of his charcoal pit for years now.If you only have limited eating capacity, make sure you try the Cheok Kee duck rice (stall 29) - my number one pick!",

I came with a couple of coworkers after work and we shared:1) Chili crab2) Beef and chicken sate 3) Grilled stingray4) Calamari 5) Chinese broccoli6) Carrot cake (savory not sweet kind)7) Teh Tarik (pulled milk tea)The Teh Tarik tea was not sweet and aerated really nicely through the hand pulling technique. This drink is usually way too sweet for my liking and good at the first sip but hard to finish. This version is best one of these I had while in Asia. \u00a0The sate has a nice bbq flavor and were juicy and not dried out. Sate in Singapore and Indonesia is really a step above what I have had in other places. Eating the real thing almost makes me not enjoy them outside of south east Asia. Singapore's iconic dish is the chili crab. The sauce is fantastic and pairs really well with the fried bread for dipping (analogous to curry and naan bread for Indian food). This dish is the only one that is expensive. Value for money isn't there like everything else but if you have never had it before you need to have it at least once. I never had stingray before and probably wouldn't have ordered it if I came here by myself. However, I am glad I tried it. The taste and texture is similar to fish. \u00a0This is something I definitely would order again.Squid, carrot cake, and veggies were also very good but not extremely memorable.",

    "text": "I cannot say how much I love this place. The last time I was in Singapore, I came here and had my first Chili Crab. OMG it was so amazing. My trip to Singapore would not be complete without a visit here. My husband and I were here around mid April so it was not so hot but I can see how warm it can get. It's a hawker style food court with a good amount of parking. We got here early enough on Saturday and Sunday night so was able to get parking. Remember to bring your own napkin, paper towel, or wet wipes. First thing you need to do is find a table/seating before you do anything else. Once you find a table, then go and walk around and find your food and drinks. \u00a0I don't know about the men, but the women's bathroom is a bit interesting. The toilet paper roll is out by the sink so you will have to grab some before you go in to the stalls. Apparently you're not suppose to wash your feet in the sink, according to the sign. A lot of the times, the guys who sell the drinks will come to your table to ask you what you want to drink. Fresh sugarcane and coconut juice is the way to go. We ordered about the same things both nights just before we came back to the states. Chili crab, stingray, satay (pork, beef, chicken), simple vegetables. Everything is just perfectly seasoned, nothing else to say. The chili crab, just the right amount of spicy, some egg, little bit of tomato sauce. I love the little baked buns they provide so you can dip all the sauce that comes with the crab. They use mud crab which we don't have in the US so even though I bought the sauce packet, it won't taste exactly the same. If I lived there, I would totally bring that sauce home and mix with rice. This is where the locals go. I love it here and hope to be back soon.",

Okay, maybe it has something to do with wanting to visit this part of Singapore, and upon discovering a food village, decided that a trek here would definitely be worth it. Anyway, like most of the other food villages I've been to, this one is pretty cool, and there are definitely a lot of options available to you. Like the other ones, the stalls generally specialise in one style of food, and the options are dirt cheap. They also have a number of drink stalls, including one that sells some rather exotic beers. Once again, a trip to Singapore is wasted if one doesn't pay a visit to these food villages.",

We arrived after 7:00 pm and it was extremely crowded; almost standing room only. I did enjoy the waterfront scenery, but it lacked the friendliness grew accustomed to elsewhere in Singapore.

He ordered us to throw it away and dont leave it there. The younger fella changed the drink to a young/green coconut unwillingly. Should rename suay suay! :/Im giving a three stars because this is a good food center but only this particular stall is terrible.",

    "text": "This is one of my favourite hawker centres in Singapore, located at the heart of East Coast Park. Going there without your own transport is inconvenient as public bus is only available during public holidays and weekends and to get there without splashing money on cab, you can take a public bus to Marine Parade (Laguna Park - nearest) and walk to the underpass behind this residential area. Do note the nearest MRT station is Bedok but there are future plans for a MRT station near the park - watch this space! What impressed me about this place is the variety and quality of food! If you want true Singapore food, this is an option for you. After enjoying your meal, you can take a stroll along the East Coast Park, rent a bicycle or do any other beach activities, as long as you enjoy that matters. For me, I love walking along beaches. Taking in the fresh air, enjoying the waves and ships passing by. There is also a Bedok Jetty which you can buy your food from the food centre and have it over there. Weekends will be very packed especially during the non-hazy period, so for tourists, I recommend this to your list of 'to-do in Singapore'.",

    "text": "I LOVE this place. It gets crowded at times, but never unbearably so. It's so lovely to sip coconut juice or sugarcane juice, rare in other heartland coffee shops, and most importantly, the carrot cake!!!! Carrot cake ($3-4, $6 for combined black and white) is my all-time favorite Singaporean food, and the store in the Lagoon is my all-time favorite stall. It's close to the famous duck rice store and the A1 curry puff store: there are only a handful of carrot cake places in the whole food village, perhaps only this one. I'm always surprised that not many people know about this place, and I'm not even sure how my parents first heard about it. I always order the white one, and I love how crispy and delicate and soft it is. One order includes several rectangles of the rice cakes and egg combination, instead of one whole square as other hawkers tend to prefer. They're packaged into styrofoam boxes (with holes punched into them so that they don't get soggy), instead of the usual brown paper wrappers, which makes it perfect for take away. I'm usually a fan of the black variety with sweet sauce, but the white ones here converted me. It's a good portion that fills you up, but I'm always longing for more after I finish eating it. The wanton noodles and previously mentioned duck rice are also solid choices here. I've also heard the traditional porridge is a good pick. The wanton noodles come in quite small portions, so it may be worth upgrading to a medium or large size if you have a larger appetite. I personally love ordering the wantons in soup and eating that with the carrot cake! Always one of my first few stops when I'm back in Singapore!! I'm clearly missing it so much now.",

We decided to squish in and take turns ordering as to not lose our spot.My friend and I ordered the stingray and fish & chips. F&C was good, but stingray was absolutely AMAZING. It came served on a banana leaf and covered in a delicious spicy sauce, along with onions and scallions.I wrapped up my meal with some sugarcane juice from the drink stand in the middle of the Food Village, and an hour later, I walked away completely stuffed and as happy as can be.",

Well, I gotta say, it is pretty hard to control yourself whenever the wisp of bbq smoke wades past the tables. Sambal Kangkong, Stingray, Oyster Omelette, Hokkien Mee are the usual standard fare. Definitely also look out for the Otah stall which sells many different types of otah, from the usual nonya and mackerel types to chilli crab, sambal sotong and even salmon ones. I'm always a little surprised to see lots of ang-mohs here with the families and drinking beer. Guess they've immersed into our local hawker culture ;)",
