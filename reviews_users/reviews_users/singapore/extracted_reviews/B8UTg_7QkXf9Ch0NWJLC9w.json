    "text": "The service here is fantastic! Although there are only 2 servers on the weekends, they manage to be patient and serve all the customers well. They are quick and friendly too. Checking with us if the food was okay. The food came quick, and it was fantastic. I ordered the Tom Yum Seafood Pasta, their speciality. For the price, I got a huge plate of creamy pasta. There were so many clams and large prawns in it. It was definitely tasty, and slightly spicy with that tom yum twist.Beers are really cheap here. A pint of Hoegarden draft for only $9.90? Good place for drinks after work.Also good for big groups as splitting would be easy. There's no hidden cost, all prices are NETT. No service charge no gst, makes everything better.",

    "text": "Starting with humble beginnings with 49 Seats (this is how they got their name) at Kreta Ayer Road in 2012 and now they have move to a bigger shop space in Orchard, Centrepoint. 49 Seats are known for their Western Fusion Asian dishes at affrodable pricing.Interior was casual with a good similar industrial chic look that contains bright hanging lights, metal chair. What caught my attention was the items that was sprayed coated in silver that sticked onto the wall. Totally Creative! Initially I thought they were just the usual props made especially for decorations but as I touched it, I realized they were all recycled items. How interesting with plastic cups, spoons, forks, plates, egg trags and even egg trays.Tom Yum Seafood pasta is rated as A spicy lover must try. Looks like this dish is highly raved because of its uniqueness. The Tom Yum was served cream base with seafood like mussels and prawns. It packed a good punch of sweetness, sourness and spiciness in every mouthful of spaghetti. This is in fact semi spicy and the bestseller here.Tom Yum Seafood - $14.90Another recommendation on its menu will be their Seafood Marinara and a good alternative if you are not keen in spicy Tom Yum. Pasta is pretty tasty with mussels and prawns paired with tomato sauce.Seafood Marinara - $13.90Adding $4.90 to my pasta for set of additional soup of the day and 1 soft drinks. I had the Cream of Brocoli with garlic bread by the side of the double layer bowl. The soup was not quite hot, however still able to warm up the tummy.The environment did leave a good impression. As we were only there for pasta, we have not tried out the other western food dishes. It will be good to be back again.",

    "text": "The food is pretty good and prices are decent ($16+ per pax inclusive of soup of the day and a soft drink/ice lemon tea at $4.90) with no GST and Service chargeHad mushroom soup and it was rather watered down. Nothing impressive. Ar least it isn't canned Campbell's soup. It also comes with a piece of garlic bread. I would pass on the Beef bolognese, flavour was way too herby, not in a good way, like as though they tried too hard to make it unique. Do try the Classic Carbonara. it comes with a generous serving of pork bacon, like really really generous. cream sauce is also fresh and tastes great with just the right amount of salt. Thw service however, needs to be brushed up. The waiter/server seem to have this air about him that just gave me and my girlfriend bad vibes when he was explaining the set meal options to us. hey we are customers, not your kids or juniors. Also insist in sitting inside even if they tell you they are fully booked and you have to sit outside. was told the reservation would be in an hour but my Gf and I finished our meal in 20mins. yet when a party of 6 walked in just like us, they managed to get seats inside on the \"reserved\" \u00a0tables. disappointed that they are so inconsistent on thisWould come back again as it's one of the better options in the Tanjong Pagar/Outram Park food places.",

The ambience is good but is a no when it's crowded , it would be super noisy and it'll not be romantic anymore. I saw many good reviews about the seafood marinara so I wanted to try it out , I thought it would be normal to the others but wow , when I tried , one word ; AWESOME ! I just love the flavor of the rich tomato base . And is worth it cuz they give the portion just nice for you . And the pasta is just too QQ and soft . The prawns is cooked perfectly . But I don't quite like the ice lemon tea , cuz when I tasted , is like its comes from the normal can . I thought it would be homemade . But overall 10/10 ! I would love to takeaway the pasta if possible !",

    "text": "Named for the number of seats available in this whitewashed, industrial style pub/diner hybrid, 49 Seats is more known for its happy hour that runs daily from 4pm - 9pm than its food.Meeting up a couple of friends there for the first time, the place was mostly filled with people who were enjoying a quick pre-dinner drink or just getting started to get sloshed with alcohol. For me, it was the food on offer that captured my attention. I had the Sirloin Al Scampi ($19.90) which was done according to the done-ness I wanted and tasted wonderful. And the prices are pretty affordable as well. It's a pity really that more people don't discover the food they have and go for the simple pub grub to go along with their drinks.",

    "text": "Overall a place that looks better than how its food taste. It takes good skills to do good Asian fusion and unfortunately 49 Seats does not cut it. After hearing good reviews about \u00a0the Tom Yam pasta, I decided to give it a shot and big mistake, Tom Yam is better as Tom Yam soup. The pasty base just did not blend well with the pasta at all. I can't even remember the ingredients in it as well. I was pretty put off but thankfully it was happy hour and the cheap drinks made up for it and I guess best of all I didn't have to pay so yea for all that it was a two star experience but if I had gone there solely for a meal, it might have been one stat or below. The place looks inviting with its dim lighting but more emphasis should be placed on the food.",
