    "text": "This buffet seems impressive at first glance, but you're probably better off going elsewhere. The price seems a bit expensive, but you get a free flow of fruit juices so it isn't that bad after all.The variety of food on offer is pretty good, though it pales before the Line (certainly I didn't see many of the premium items other reviewers mentioned, though it might be because I was there for weekday lunch). And they had the horror that is chicken ham and none of the proper stuff.The food quality on the other hand is slightly uneven - some dishes were good, some were mediocre, but most were alright. Overall the food quality was below what you would find at a premium buffet in Singapore.For example, the Indian curries were bland (though the tandoori chicken was really flavourful, yet the tandoor fish and lamb were forgettable), and the naan was not very fresh. The other food sections followed this pattern. The many duck dishes in particular were all slightly overcooked - possibly because they had been stewing in the buffet section for too long.The desserts on the other hand were the most disappointing part of the buffet: the waffles were dry and overcooked ,and some of the cakes were dry too. Meanwhile the ice cream had a few ice crystals in it, and the flavour was only alright (not quite premium level). None of the desserts had the wow factor.On the up side, the service was good - they took away plates quickly, and quickly folded my napkin though I wasn't away from my seat for very long (and the restaurant was quite crowded).",

The flavour and the sauces of the Hainanese chicken were quite authentic and good. However, the texture of the chicken was somewhat on the tough side, not tender enough. The decoration and service are similar to what one might expect from a modern, international 5-star hotel. Quite good, but within expectation.",

    "text": "Say hello once again to one of the best buffets in Singapore! Melt Cafe at Mandarin Oriental, Singapore is back, prettier and better with their all-day dining buffet offering.Melt Cafe got it right by tantalizing us with the extensive dessert and patisserie counter right at their doorstep. But if you are savory sort, you're not that far away from the fresh seafood counter where you'd be greeted with neat stacks of shellfish and crustaceans, sashimi, sushi, and cold cuts. While people were distracted by the seafood (which is quite the standard fare at buffets), i went exploring and found the a la minute Japanese Wagyu beef Shabu Shabu live station. O.M.G. Way too many servings of the tender beef over flavored Japanese rice.At the Chinese food live station, there's the super rich Boston Lobster laksa (though we didn't quite taste the lobster), and not so Drunken Herbal Prawns.A small roast and carving corner presents decent meats which were quite juicy despite it being on the buffet counter. Cook-to-order pastas can also be customised with a choice of toppings and sauces.Melt is known for their Indian cuisine and it remains a top favourite. Their freshly made naans are the best! Ask them for the cheese ones, they are really amazing with the different types of spicy curries and Tandoori meats.There're also the European and Asian spreads which offer a variety of soups, vegetables, rice and meats. The garlic bread is perfect with the white wine mussels! Head outdoors for some alfresco dining amidst lush greenery while enjoying a special barbecue showcasing grilled lamb and beef steaks as well as seafood and roasted vegetables during dinner. Save some space for the desserts! I was crazy about their freshly made crepes with filled pastry cream (ask for more), topped with the rich and creamy ice cream (loved the chocolate and vanilla). Of course cakes and chocolate fondue cannot be missed. Skip the macarons though, you wouldn't get them in your mouth anyway because they crumble so badly (just as well). The cheese selection, though small, was decent. The price is fairly reasonable imo.Lunch: $62/pax (Mon - Sat)Dinner: $78/pax (Sun - Wed), $88/pax with bbq (Thu - Sat)Sun Brunch: $98/$158/pax (latter with free flow Veuve Cliquot champagnes, wines, cocktails, beers, juices and soft drinks). Overall, quality over quantity does it for me. Melt Cafe is definitely a decent and affordable buffet option in the city.",

Local favorites like nasi lemak, roti prata, fish ball noodles, assorted congee and exotic fruits nestled among galore of pastries, breads, meats and desserts...one is surely spoiled for choices. Everything tastes authentic and scrumptious. The restaurant is run by managers who do not hesitate to greet and assist and their staff who gives prompt attention and superb service. If not for our dinners already scheduled for the duration of our stay, we will not hesitate to try their dinner buffet as well. We're sure it will be equally delectable.",

Great service - the waiters are always paying attention and ready to take your plates, refill your drinks, refold your napkin, etc. The food was very good for a buffet and really a huge variety. The seafood station for your shellfish was constantly refilled by the staff - fresh and cold as you would expect. There was a noodle station, an indian food section (lots of choices), chinese food, bbq section, sushi, salad, cheese, and of course dessert. The dessert section was quite expansive and there really was a lot of variety. Everything looked good so I would recommend to come here hungry!! The fresh fruit juice station was also very nice.

    "text": "I struggled about what rating to give this one, and finally went for 3 stars, which I interpret strictly as \"A-OK.\" \u00a0Let me tell you why. \u00a0The positives:There is a pretty good selection of dishes: sushi, salads, cheeses, made-to-order pasta and noodles (both Western and Asian styles), carving station for roast beef and chicken, hot dishes (in Western, Chinese, and Indian style). \u00a0Most are pretty good. \u00a0The sushi was good by buffet standards, especially the salmon. \u00a0The Indian dishes were also nice, as were the lamb shank (western) and roast beef.There is also a juice bar over by the desserts and fresh fruit. \u00a0I like to mix mine to get a P.O.G. (pineapple, orange, guava) in homage to the Hawaiian favorite... although P should be passionfruit instead of pineapple, it's still good. \u00a0Unfortunately you have to ask every time which juice is which because the carafes aren't labeled and they change position.The decor is nice, giving adequate light without being glaring. \u00a0The service was mostly friendly and efficient. \u00a0Whenever we got up for another round, a server would come and fold our napkins for us. \u00a0This is a nice touch. \u00a0Our used plates were cleared off generally promptly, and the busser was polite in asking if we were finished with a plate. \u00a0The wait staff overall were pleasant and in good temper, too.The negatives:We went for lunch on a Friday, with a reservation at noon. \u00a0We arrived at 11:59 (yeah, I checked the clock on my phone) and were asked to wait because the buffet doesn't start until noon. \u00a0Um... OK. \u00a0We weren't the only people there, but there certainly was plenty of room for the few people who were waiting.The desserts were not as impressive as we expected, despite the apparent selection. \u00a0The waffle was awfully spongy without any crisp to it (even when it just came from the iron). The cakes were stiff and dry (even ones that should be cream cakes). \u00a0The panna cotta was salty. \u00a0The one highlight was the apple crumble with vanilla ice cream... which isn't exactly haute cuisine.The chocolate fountain is actually chocolate sauce, not molten chocolate: that is, after it cools it stays liquid. \u00a0I'm not saying it was Hershey's chocolate syrup, but it was rather reminiscent. \u00a0I think if it were better chocolate, it should harden as it cools, but not quite like the chocolate candy shell they use at Dairy Queen. \u00a0By contrast with Melt, the chocolate fountain at the Rose Veranda at the Shangri-La hotel is really chocolate-y rather than syrup-y.Lastly, the price is fairly high for lunch at $68++, which comes out to about $80 per person (although you get 15% off if you pay with the right credit card). \u00a0This is pretty steep, even with the broad selection. \u00a0On top of that, the only beverages you get are a glass of water and the juice bar. \u00a0Seriously, no coffee or tea to go with dessert? \u00a0You are charging that much for a cup of coffee? \u00a0No.Summary:We enjoyed the meal and ate a good amount, and we appreciated the decor and service. \u00a0The desserts and charged caffeine were letdowns. \u00a0We would consider returning. \u00a0Still, I'm not ready to call off the search for the ideal buffet lunch.",

There's your usual seafood counter brimming with the freshest lobsters, crab legs & claws, scallops and freshly shucked oysters. Then you have an outdoor BBQ station that serves up wonderful mini wagyu beef burgers, tenderloins, lamb racks and grilled skewers! If that isn't enough to whet your appetite, you just have to pay the other stations a visit. One of the highlights, apart from the free flow Veuve Clicquot, is the Belgian waffles and crepe station that makes the best desserts to have after pigging out on the amazing fare on offer.",

    "text": "This ranks at the top of my list of buffets around Singapore. I've been here around two to three times in the past year and they've never failed to please me. Always leave this place stuffed and happy.Attack the seafood first would be my recommendation on how to start. They have a great variety, from salmon and tuna sashimi to crab and lobster to smoked snow fish. ALL are great and I particularly like the snow fish better than the sashimi. Oh and did I mention there are also oysters on the menu?Next, move on to the Indian food. I hear that they are famous amongst the Indian community because the quality and variety of their Indian food is really top-notch. Personally I love the Tandoori meats.Near the Indian food spread is a cooking station that serves up some really lovely pasta with lots of condiments thrown in. Customise it the way you want, I normally go for a mix of carbonara and tomato base.The Chinese food section is pretty decent, I would highlight the crayfish from this part, can't really remember anything else that I had from this side of the buffet line.And finally, saving what I feel is the best for last (and how things should be) is the dessert line. They have THE BEST Bellgian waffles I've ever tasted in Singapore. Made right on the spot when you place your order, there are just so many things you can plonk onto your waffle that you should make an attempt to try them all. The clotted cream is really well done, it feels home made rather than something bought from a supermarket. Ditto for their ice creams as well.Other desserts worth focusing on are the panna cotta and some of the cakes.Will definitely be back here.",

    "text": "probably the best buffet I've had in singapore - in short: high quality food - not the best in themselves, especially if considered separately \u00a0- but very good for the fantastically large range on offer. even better than the line at the shangri-la, which has seen standards dwindling in the past years. heavy sticker on this one too, but we waddled away overstuffed and happy - so perhaps an occasional treat?they have a lovely garden outside near the barbecue area - very lovely. there's a lovely spread of bread and salads on offer; the cold seafood section was rather fresh. I rather like the barbecued section - though it was a little occupied (pitiful singular waiter grilling up everything), everything from the roast pork to the seafood made us happy.they had a european section with stews and loads of vegetables - something very often missing in buffets. a decent indian section too - but I think straits kitchen wins out here.and a nominal section of east asian offerings - chinese cooked food and a japanese section. the sushi was rather paltry though - I'd say to keep the space for something else.there was a rather fantastic dessert spread here though. the long of the short is that the desserts span cakes, mousses, little mignardises and modernesque dessert-in-spoons, fruit and a cheese board. and a waffle maker.layered mousse cakes, apricot tea cakes, american-type carrot cake, a berried trifle and local kueh kuehs - my sister went a little nuts over their tiny spoonfuls of dessert \u00a0- I think there must have been more than ten on offer.I was quite impressed with the cheese counter. it was small but satisfying, especially since none of us had much space left for cheese anyway. a pretty good range of fruit too that was frequently replenished.the restaurant isn't super modern, but rather homey old-school, good for large family dinners; it was noisy and vibrant, and everybody was kept happy with the spread of food. it is probably one of the more expensive buffets, and so wasted on me - but if you have a decent appetite, this will do right.p.s. I've got probably a million photos on the blog if you want to check it out before you visit.",

    "text": "I have heard many good reviews about Melt at Mandarin Oriental Hotel from my friends. So I decided to organize a team bonding dinner with my colleagues to Melt. The moment I walked into Melt, I was fascinated by the wide varieties of food. There are a wide spread of seafood. I think the snow crab leg alone is totally worth the money for. The freshness and sweetness of the snow crab is totally fabulous. Not forgetting about their oyster dip with lemon and Tabasco. Thumb ups! We went on a Friday. So there is an outdoor BBQ station that will grill up mini wagyu beef burgers. The wagyu beef burger is very juicy. You would definitely be craving for more after the first serving. I would have to say for the price I'm paying for, Melt is really worth a try if you want to go for a great buffet feast.",

    "text": "Amazing buffet! (AND a la carte menu available)Usually, I am NOT a fan of buffets; however, Melt is VERY clean, VERY well organized, NOT cramped and includes an unbelievable selection of foods from around the world... All in one place!I don't think I have ever had such personal (remember your name, beverage, likes, etc.) kind of service at any other buffet! Servers are always smiling and always trying to anticipate your needs, wants and desires. KUDOS to the management and staff for setting the service standard very high ... AND maintaining it! Breakfast is included with your Mandarin Oriental Hotel room.Lunch (i didn't try it, but wished I had!)Dinner: Menu or buffet is excellent... Chinese, Indian, English, American, Japanese... they have it all! \u00a0Prepared well and appealing to the eye! Be sure you're hungry!Thank you, Melt!",
