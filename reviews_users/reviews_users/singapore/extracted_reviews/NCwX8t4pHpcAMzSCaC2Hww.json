    "text": "The decor alone was enough to pique my curiosity and want to give this place a try. I have returned many times since for the food. As you make your way down to the restaurant, you are greeted with various Swiss-themed characters that actually move. Once you enter the restaurant, the food takes over.Everything is presented well, you can choose what you want and then give your card to the person serving at that station to add to your bill. At the end of your meal, you present your card to the cashier and pay. The concept is good and there are many options to choose from though paying for each item as you go can add up. My favorite thing is to choose from their special promo- they have one for lunch and dinner- you get an entree plus a homemade drink. At lunch it is only $8.90, quite a bargain, though it does go up some for dinner.They also have tasty sandwiches and other treats available upstairs. All in all, still a good value and worth giving them a try.",

Scope out the place because the servings are large and the options aplenty. Paella, crepes, wood burning pizza, veggies, soup, \u00a0Caesar salad, sandwiches, sausages...the list goes on. They are great marketers for a number of reasons--1) they give you a card to swipe so you can keep going back and purchasing things (small lemonade was $4.50) and then you have sticker shock at check out; 2) there is a great play area where, after you have spent $10.90 on one of their kid meals, you can safely dispatch the children to play; 3) it's located under a mall at least two floors down and it's cool (with the Singapore heat you'll pay almost anything for relief) and 4) the food is fresh, fresh, fresh. $92.50 for three adults and one child for lunch, and I'd do it again. It's nice to have some not-so-Asian food and you get it at Marche.",

    "text": "I like the concept of Marche, always have and probably always will. It is actually quite like a cooler version of a food court where you are given a card to pay for food from the various stalls and then you settle the bill in your card before you leave. Of course, it is far more expensive than a food court as well and serves primarily Western food with quite a few Swiss dishes such as its popular Rosti. When it comes to outlets, I still prefer the one at Vivo City. The food at the 313 outlet, particularly the rosti, is not as good as at Vivo City. The rosti is usually overcooked and the queue is usually very long depending on the time of day. An average meal comes up to about $25 and so far, I don't feel that it's worth the price. The pork and chicken leg we had the last time was rather dry. I do, however, quite like their selection of breads in the bakery outside.",

The one dish that screams Marche till this day would have to be the Rosti with the spiral sausage or smoke salmon. I have not found or tried better Rosti so far. A huge dash of sour cream and extra chives and you're good to go! Yet another dish that has stood the test of time would be the savory crepes. My personal combo would be salmon, mushrooms, cheese and salad all packed into the crepe. This is a fairly heavy dish and is perfect to share between 2. The only downside however is that drinks are on the pricey side with fruit juices costing almost $8. If only there was ice water on the house. Overall a great place to enjoy a hearty meal!",

Not that I minded cuz I grew up on it but variety is the spice of life.Anyway I walked by the Marche by Movenpick so I decide to try it. I walked into the downstairs restaurant and was given the lunch specials for the week and a credit card. I was a little confused but soon figured out the process. Simply go to any of the food stations and order your food, drink or dessert. Hand over the card and the charges are added into it. Then find yourself a table and start eating. When you are done walk to the exit and hand over the card to the cashier. He will figure out what you owe and after paying you are on your way.Firstly the process was easy enough to figure out by watching others. Secondly some of the food stations can have pretty long lines and you might have to wait a while for you turn. Thirdly, the food was pretty good but a little too salty but that could be the dish I ordered (Swiss Rosti with salami and tomato chutney). Fourthly service is mostly absent as it was all self serve.I would give it 3.5 stars if I could and I would try some of the other dishes next time.",

    "text": "I've been to Marche in 313 Somerset a few times now. You'd never know there's a massive restaurant with a ton of variety lurking one floor beneath the bakery emitting heavenly smells. You go inside and take the stairs to the right. You are greeted at the bottom by someone handing you a card at the bottom. You will use this card at all of the food stations you decide to order from. They put the information on your card and you will use it to pay at a station as you leave, so don't lose it!Now for the food. I haven't seen this kind of variety anywhere else besides MEDZ's in the basement of Orchard Central, which is no longer open. The produce is really fresh and they offer filled crepes, salads, veggies, and meats ranging from fish to chicken and steak. You hand them your card when you order and they either hand you the food or tell you how long the wait will be. You go grab your food from the same station if there is a wait. You also seat yourself, and seating is plentiful. I did venture down here one day for lunch during the weak during the peak hour and it was a bit crowded and daunting, so I recommend hitting them during slow times if you don't love crowds.They got something for everyone and are good for large groups or just a solo dining experience. They made it very easy for me to follow the Paleo lifestyle! Worth checking out.",

Different primarily because (a) cuisine-wise - so not Asian; (b) decor-wise - like I was at a luxury-type family camp; (c) price-wise - up to three times more than the usual Kopitiam; (d) location-wise - not only in town, but buried deep under like a bunker...freaking awesome; (e) atmosphere - casual, relaxing, family-friendly, with a *BEAST* A/C that made me forget the infamous Singapore heat; and (f) experience-wise - worth doing at *least* once (in my case, just twice).Both times in this...\"Western-styled Kopitiam\"...was a breath of fresh air. Each of us were given a card (the kiddos were particularly excited about their \"credit cards\") to use for keeping tabs on whatever dishes we ordered within the establishment. It's so easy to get carried away...just order something, pass the service staff your card, get swiped, pick up your dish...and head back to your table to eat. However, *please* don't lose this freaking card. I asked the lady at the payment counter and a lost card was like $150'ish. (Come to think of it...can you imagine if a whole group goes in, charges all cards with a drink each, and then spam orders everything else on just one card and then \"loses\" it? $150...? Only? Sure! LOL, okay, please don't do that...this is Singapore afterall...the consequences will...s-u-c-k!)So while the decor, location, and overall atmopshere were all great...they failed to shine in the most important area: le' food.The food was just okay. It was presented so well on the plate...but was just so...okay. It tasted fresh and the quantity was decent...but the taste was just okay.Okay, just okay, get it? Only 3-stars...because this place is just okay...especially when my own tab came up to $70+ both times. (Oh family, what I do to hang out with you all...)NOTE:No pictures at or around the stalls. The service staff were pretty quick at making it *very* clear.Yelp 100: 56/100/My-last-3-weeks-in-SG",

My partner really loves the rosti with smoked salmon though. It is best not to go during the lunch hour or dinner unless you don't mind constantly queueing for the table, then the food and drinks. However, local people don't mind queuing and I suppose they get used to it in the hawker centres and have become their culture. I won't go there for a relaxed meal unless it is not in the busy time and it is far from ideal when you have children in the group.Another thing I want to highlight is that this place is also good for vegetarian and health concious people as they serve organic or food that are preservatives free and the ingredients of the food were fresh.",

As you descend the stairs down to the restaurant, a friendly worker will hand you a card. From there, you decide what you want to eat, drink and how much you want. When you add things to your tray, you hand the worker behind each counter your card which keeps tabs of what you'll be consuming. I usually go during lunch, since their special can't be beat. $8.90 for a meal + one of their handmade drinks. Seeing as their drinks are usually $4-5, having them include it in the lunch special is a steal. Their lunch menu is updated every week online and they usually offer four different options every weekday. I've never been disappointed with my meal at Marche. My go to drink is the pineapple lemonade which goes perfectly with many of their meal options. Their rotisserie items, Swiss rosti, and pizza selections are always a safe bet. Be sure to grab one of their free apple card candies on your way out, and also stop by their bakery upstairs. Their beignets, rolls and sandwiches are also a must try.",

    "text": "Marche is a Swiss restaurant that has a unique concept. Unlike other conventional restaurants whereby you order, pay and consume, each customer is issued a Marche card. They then enter the restaurant and order their dishes from the various stations. These include fresh fruit juices, other beverages, roasted dishes and soup. The rosti is absolutely delicious. Image this; sinking your teeth into strips of potato dripping in butter sauce. You can choose to eat this alone with a dollop of sour cream, or with sides like smoked salmon or sausage. After dining, simply swipe your card at the exit to get your total bill, pay and proceed to exit. If you're not in the mood for a full meal, the Marche bakery offers a wide selection of breads at affordable prices. All breads are baked on the spot, with rows of freshly baked crispy breads in the background. Truly a feast for the eyes. But at the end of the day, the most important thing is the taste, which also did not disappoint. The Rosti-Bacon roll is delicious and fragrant, but a little too hard for my liking. Try the swiss-hot-cross bun that are soft, fluffy and slightly sweet. Perfect for a light afternoon snack. It also offers a variety of pastries and open sandwiches that are drool-inducing just by looking at it. The fruit tarts glisten attractively with fresh fruits packed atop of the pastry. Complete your afternoon pick-me-up with a hot cup of tea, coffee or even canned drinks if they suit your preference!",

Nevertheless, i still go for my standard choice, Plain Swiss Rosti with Sour Cream, this is a must try in Marche. One of their signature dish. Always in long queue when u head into Marche.The crust is crispy and together with the sour cream, thumbs up!I will always order their mushroom soup as well. Nice thick mushroom soup. Now, it's the dessert time. I'm always a fan of Marche's waffles! Together with the best ice cream in the World, Movenpick ice cream, best combination you could ever ask for. Totally fabulous!Even though, Marche is a bit pricey. It is really a good place to hang out with your brunch of friends.",

I am quite partial to their rosti.. I mean seriously, you've gotta try their rosti at least ONCE in your life. Who the heck goes to Marche and not eat their rosti? Their desserts are tons of misses (don't get me started on their bread and butter pudding.. oh the horror..) .. the only thing they got right are their crepe desserts and their Movenpick ice cream sorbet (which are heavenly). Their soups and pasta are delicious as well.. and their crepes.. mmm.. do give Marche a go when you want something a little bit unique.",

Overall, I did enjoy my food, but kind of expected something better than what I was given.I like the unique concept of how to pay later and all transactions in the restaurants are made via the Marche card. Word of caution here, DO NOT or rather, NEVER lose that card. You pay hell a lot more than what you will be eating if you lose it.The must try at Marche are the Rosti and Soup! I wouldn't recommend desserts there nor a place to chill and hang out. If you must, head up to Blue Mountain Cafe, located in the same mall for drinks and coffee.",

Obviously everyone knows about the rostti from Marche. Its gotta be rostti with smoked salmon for me. The crepes are pretty great too and so are the soups. The pizzas here - I would give a miss. I like my pizzas with the tomato base. What they do here is places tomato slices under the toppings. Honestly, I don't know how that adds any sort of flavour to the dough. So just a heads up.",

The decor deserves a mention as it just adds to your curiosity of what new might be in store! The well placed wines, fresh vegetables and fruits only fuel your hunger. Going with a family of 6-7 people is great so that people can order different stuff and you get to try more dishes. Also, do not just go to the restaurant and stand in front of a counter and order. Just when you look up and think \"Heyy!! Let me have this..\", \u00a0the counter ahead might be just as promising. So just go around the whole place, counter by counter, \u00a0take in the sights and make a mental note of the must haves.The chicken crepe was the finest dish I had at this place and the strawberry cake won it in the desserts section. Definitely take the Thai coconut if you never have.. the sweetest thing ever! Seafood pasta was okay but I wouldn't mind if it had been a tad bit creamier. Chicken wings were good but I have had better. The good thing was that the items are prepared in front of you! Definitely try the fruit juice section.. Amazing fruit juice at this place.. Sweet crepes are also available and I liked the one my sis ordered.. With banana and chocolate inside! All in all a super place to go when you're hungry and a must try in Singapore!",
