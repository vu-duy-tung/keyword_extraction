I figured, there's no line outside the \"line starts here\" sign, which indicates this place must get fairly crowded. I decided to check them out.The dish is really simple as it only comes with one egg, a piece of pork, noodles, and broth. The egg is perfect. That's the only way to describe it and it's the restaurant's saving grace. I just don't think the price scales with what you get. Ichiran in Shibuya and Shinsengumi in LA's Little Tokyo tastes so much better compared to this pricey ramen. Would I go back? That's a solid maybe.",

    "text": "An interesting departure from the usual ramen. Tsuta's famed Michelin one star (Tokyo edition) shoyu soba highlights a very refined, clean tasting yet satisfying broth with excellent flavor profile. The addition of pureed truffle in oil may not appeal to some but lends an earthy dimension to the soup which was good to the last drop.The finely stranded noodles are reminiscent of soba but unlike buckwheat noodles, it has ramen's elastic/al-dente texture and were cooked perfectly.The accompanied bamboo shoot was soft/fresh tasting and coupled with the julienned green onion, delightful to partake. Duck wonton add-on had large soft pillowy skin although the meat did not appear to be hand-chopped and thus lacked the mouth feel of typical wonton.Char Siu, the weak spot in this otherwise sublime dish was not melt-in-the mouth tender and disappointingly unremarkable.",

    "text": "After visiting Ichiran in HK, did not think I would find a place to top that ramen experience...until I visited Tsuta! First night in SG and found this place just a couple of blocks from Hyatt where we stayed. There was a bit of a queue, about 10 deep, but they are nice enough to provide seats for those waiting. Our wait time was about 45 mins as the restaurant is not that big.Once we were in, we placed our order through the touch screen, but the wait staff is there to assist with any questions.We all selected the Shoyu soba noodles. The seating area is in a circular bar like setting with the kitchen front and center so you can watch the masters create your bowl of soba.The broth by itself was very good, but once mixed in the truffle puree, my taste buds and mind was blown! Like I stated in my Ichiran review, this Tsuta broth is only equaled by Ichiran, but with the truffle puree (and I have a truffle fetish), I would say this beats Ichiran by the slimmest of margins.Highly recommend and wish they open a location in the SF Bay Area!",

    "text": "So So SobaFinally! After over a year of it's opening, over a year of waiting, looking on enviously at the crowd queueing up, after a year of anticipation, I finally had the opportunity to try Tsuta and it......disappointed.Don't get me wrong, I still think it was a fairly good bowl of noodles but for all the hype and build-up it came with, it didn't quite hit the \"one sip of the broth and the heavens opened up\" mark. Because we were there at 3pm on a Wednesday afternoon, the restaurant was empty. The service staff was friendly and explained to us their signature dish and the steps to order. Ajitama Shoyu Soba ($16.80 + $2.00 for 2 Yuzu Wantons)The soup was very fragrant. You could smell that rich umami from the Shoyu and the hint of truffle oil was prominent as the hot soup brought out the fragrance of the truffle. The soup was light and had that prominent taste of the Shoyu that just about lingered as an after taste. Strangely, I may have actually preferred the soup without the truffle and felt it could have used an additional punch. The noodles were interesting though. Because of the mix of wheats and flours, as well as how thin it was, it felt almost like skinny ramen / Mee kiah (the thin yellow noodles normally eaten with Minced pork noodles). I did feel that because the noodles were thin and straight and with the soup being fairly light, it didn't quite pick up the soup as you ate. The wantons were alright? A little pedestrian and it really made me feel like I was having a bowl of wanton Mee soup but the star of the bowl had to be egg. It has to THE best ajisuke tamago I've had..... EVER! The egg was cooked to perfection, with the yolk being soft and sticky and the flavours were amazing! It was sweet, salty and had all these subtle tastes blended into a beautiful, harmonious ballet of flavours Overall, this bowl of noodles left me very confused. When I first left the shop I didn't think it was fantastic. When I started writing this post I felt it was slightly above average but as I wrote, I felt certain elements deserved more praise while certain didn't live up to expectations, so for now, I'll give it a 3*. I have this funny feeling I would head back, just to give it a second go but this time, I'll try the Shio and I just might end up giving Tsuta 4*s.",

The outlet was quite small and could only sit 18 at the counter. Order was taken through the self service machine. There was no queue as we reached the place past 9pm. The place was just half filled. We were showed to the end of the counter with water served to us.Ajitama Shoyu Soba ($16.80)Char Sui (1 slice), flavoured egg, bamboo shoot, leek & truffle pureed in truffle oil Selected the original version.The soup base smelt quite nice of the truffle, with a hint of it in the taste. The soup was surprisingly light in taste and not salty, just nice. The noodles was cooked just nice. The char sui was tender and tear easily. The egg had the beautiful yolk flowing out easily, while not salty in taste.Ajitama Shio Soba ($16.80)Char Sui (1 slice), flavoured egg, bamboo shoot, leek & green olives pureed in truffle oil Selected the original version.The soup was made of a chicken-seafood blend, with additional of Okinawa sea salt and Mongolian rock salt. The soup base was lighter than the shoyu version, with a very distinct minty taste.Overall it was quite refreshing light and simple version of noodles soup without the fancy add on. There was none of the too salty soup base which I heard about.",

    "text": "I've heard many things about Tsuta. When you have a Michelin star ramen come to town, it's not something people keep quiet about, ever. I've heard it all, 1 hour queues, too salty, underwhelming, the worst ramen I've ever had. Despite this, I felt like I needed to try it to decide for myself. When I got there, there was pretty much no queue and I got a table within 5 minutes of arriving. You place your order on one of those vending machine (much like in Japan). In case you're not sure about what you want there's a staff member there to help you. Although on the menu it states soba, I can assure you it's the ramen with all know and love. Food didn't take long, and with the kitchen in plain view, I was very excited. You could see them even scorch the chashu for the rice, which made me think I should shave ordered that instead. The decor is a very sleek old style ramen bar.I ordered the shoyu soba, which a less salty broth after being warned about it by everyone. I will say it's passable. I paid about $22-23 for the ramen with egg and chashu, and I'm not sure if it's worth it. The broth is still salty, despite it being a less salt variant. I'm not new comer to ramen, having eaten my way through Japan last year, almost exclusively in ramen. I feel the Japanese like a salter broth but this was nothing special. The noodles were well cooked, and the egg was eh. The chashu is really good though, with well-marbled pieces of meat, with the torched marks not unlike the one for the rice dish. Overall, Tsuta was underwhelming for having a Michelin star. Will I come back? Probably not at that price point. Is it worth a try to weigh in on the world famous ramen? why not.",

Hawker stands are perfectly fine with great \"homemade\" taste at a student's price.I heard about Tsuta when I was watching a news clip on the news. A Michelin Star ramen place in Singapore? Of course I would have to seek and and try no matter how long the wait will be. Sure enough it was a good 40 mins sitting outside in the heat waiting for a seat in their small \"traditional\" ramen set up facing the chefs. Sure didn't hold too many people. Good part. The soup base was very clean and clear of any oil or other substance. Had a slight clam or oyster type of backend taste. Needless to say the broth was darn good. They used really fresh Bambi shoots compared the the can ones most other ramen places serve (theirs were not rectangular but \u00a0uncut). Ramen texture was good. Mine had two thin slices of pork that didn't have too much flavor and one egg. Overall good gourmet ramen but for the die hard ramen lovers looking for flavor and many toppings, this place ain't it. Overall, always have to try at least once but I would think twice of going back if I had to wait more than 15 mins for a table. Lots of hype but I was underwhelmed but he experience and what they get for the price.",

The noodles are really soba and made of buckwheat, the soup is clear and extremely flavourful without being too thick (I had the shio noodles), the vegetables were really fresh, and the char siew had just the right amount of tenderness. Service was friendly and efficient. I came at 11.30am on a weekday, and there wasn't any queue. You order and pay at a kiosk before sitting at the counter, so it can be pretty fast.

    "text": "The ramen was good but for the wait time, I would rather go somewhere else. They have less than 20 seats and they're all at the bar... which makes it extremely difficult if you are dining with a large party. I got there when it opened and there was already a 20+ people line on a weekday. The line was extremely slow due to the seating set up. When it's finally your turn, you order from a digital menu, pay, and then wait some more inside to get seated at the bar. After you get seated, the cooks wait until they have a few orders before they really start preparing your ramen noodle dish. I got the regular shoyu ramen with an egg (only comes with one slice of pork). The place is called tsuta Japanese soba noodle but the noodles tasted like regular ramen to me. The broth was warm and was a lighter taste than the typical fatty pork base soup. The pork was not anything special. One bowl without extra add ons is definitely enough for a meal. Not sure it's worth the Michelin star hype.",
