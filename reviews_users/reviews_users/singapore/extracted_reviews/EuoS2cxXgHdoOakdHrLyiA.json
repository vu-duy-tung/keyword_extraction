    "text": "Decent selection and ambience for a hotel buffet. Rise is baby-friendly to boot for family gatherings. Check out their daily specials. I came on Seafood night which is a Tuesday I believe. That works out great for me since I do like to feast on all things from the sea. Starting out with sashimi, oysters, scallops, mussels, crab legs, and octopus from the raw bar, it was the perfect way to start the gluttonous meal when paired with Mediterranean mezze and fresh salad. A variety of global cuisine in the hot section including local faves like black pepper crab and roast duck to Indian Kerela fish curry to Spanish paella and slices of prime rib. All decent but not necessarily memorable. I stuck with the raw bar more. Some desserts to cap off the meal. I was unimpressed with the pastries but thankfully the \u00a0fresh fruits like mango and dragon fruit plus zesty sorbets ended the meal on the right note. Service was attentive and friendly. Asked to be seated deeper inside the restaurant if the night is a romantic affair as it's dimmer and away from the tourists visiting MBS. Also believe there are discounts if you are part of the rewards program.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed, the worst tasting buffet in Asia I've ever had. Do they not have a chef tasting these things? The muesli was the only good thing. I had pastries, the Chinese food, Indian food, dim sum, breakfast. The muesli was the only good thing. This place needs a new chef & needs to retrain all of their cooks. It wasn't cheap for the poor quality. Asia is famous for amazing breakfast buffets, this place needs to step it up.",

    "text": "Average buffet breakfast, typical to what to be expected from a 5 Star hotel breakfast.They have two omelette stations. They have an Asian station and an international station. I got all of my food from the international station. They also have pastry station for all of the sweet stuff. It got crowded after 8am but not overly crowded given that the seating place is really big. They open at 6:30am and close at 10:30am. Marina bay has 3 other breakfast buffet restaurants I believe not sure if they serve different food.",

    "text": "Being one of the more expensive buffet's I've been to, I was expected the food to be much much better than something like a Golden Corral.The food was better, but not proportionally better given that the buffet was almost 5 times more. The buffet environment was beautiful, given that it was in the Marina Bay Sands area. There were tons of food choices, but none of the main entr\u00e9es jumped out at me. Everything was just okay.My favorite part was probably the desserts. They had this huge circular dessert bar where the desserts were located on the outer table, and the chefs were in the center preparing new desserts. They had everything from chocolate pieces with nuts to chocolate souffl\u00e9s. Willy Wonka would've approved.Wouldn't recommend this buffet, your ~$70 SGD is better spent somewhere else.",

    "text": "I passed by Rise many times but it never occurred to me to dine there until recently. As it was still within the 15 days of Chinese New Year, the price went up by $10 because they were serving some CNY dishes. Errrr....the only CNY dishes I saw was a plate of yusheng in the salad section and 3 types of snacks in the dessert section (prawn rolls, kueh bangkit and something else). There was a wide variety of dishes with many sections - Asian, Indian, Western, pasta station, salad, cold cut appetizer, cold seafood, Japanese, soup and bread, dessert plus cheese and fresh juices. I love the Western dishes - braised veal cheeks so soft and tender it melted in the mouth. Rigatoni was cheesy and rich. Broccoli au gratin was equally good. The giant red snapper was very fresh and the meat was not too tough. The beef cubes in the Chinese section was a bit tough, especially when compared to the veal cheeks. But the broccoli and mushrooms were big and juicy. There was a honeycomb with honey dripping. Love this. The other place I have seen this was at Swiss Cafe at Swissotel the Stamford for morning breakfast. The juices (apple, orange and mango) were ok, but I preferred the fresh juices at 10 at Claymore (apple, orange, grapefruit and pineapple). The selection of cheese and freshly baked bread/rolls were very tempting. Olive roll, sundried tomato...shallot bread...yum. For the Japanese section, there was cold soba, some sushi which did not look very appetizing. The sashimi (tuna and salmon) was fresh and good. The cold seafood include crabs, prawns, mussels, clams, the usual suspects. I like the cold meat section with smoked salmon and seafood terrine. There were also smoked trout and other fish and cold cuts. The rojak was also pretty good with crispy you tiao. There were 2 local soup dishes which were made to order - laksa and fish ball noodles. Did not try those so could not comment on that. Desserts - the cakes were good, looked like what you could get at SweetSpot, the dessert coffee place in MBS. What blew me away was the warm stuff - sticky toffee pudding, chocolate souffle and bread and butter pudding. The bread and butter pudding was \u00a0the highlight. It was moist and sweet with a surprise dark chocolate base at the bottom. Topped with vanilla sauce, it was sublime. I had the rum and raisin ice cream to go with the pudding and it was generously laced with rum. As the place is pretty big with high glass ceiling, you do not feel hemmed in at all. The only \"drawback\" would be the sunlight if you dislike being in the sun. Otherwise it is a bright and airy place, nice for a lunch date.",

    "text": "Kudos for the food varieties. Colour and texture looks appetising but unfortunately it is too dry from my perspective. Sashimi looks beautiful but it is not as fresh and chewy as it looks. Main dish wise I'm disappointed. With the 1 for 1 voucher it is is worth to try I guess..Next, dessert. Mochi is chewy but the inside is not appetising. I tried a few dealer and I think the small plate of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is the most appetising. The pudding like cocktail is good too with longan, blueberry and strawberry. Gelato sorbet - mango and strawberry is good too. Overall I still into the desserts here than the main course.Parking- you can park at the hotel or the shoppes area. For the shoppes parking, park at the central and walk to the left and left till you see the MRT sign and follow the sign board towards the hotel. It is in Tower 1. Open space concept that you can hardly miss. Bon appetit!",

A few years back I would have given this place 4 stars, but this year wasn't as great and I would probably think twice about paying ~$40SGD for their breakfast buffet. There was a lot to choose from.. Western, Indian, Chinese, juices, cereal, breads, noodle bar, omelette station, porridge, bagels, etc. but nothing really stood out as really amazing. Service was ok, except for when they accidentally cleaned our entire table (took our tea, utensils, napkins, everything) thinking we had left.. Even though we still had other food on the table. I can get a lot more satisfying food for $40 from the hawker stalls.",

Breakfast - plethora of options.As it is the complimentary option that comes with staying in a regular MBS room, this place is super crowded in the mornings! I don't know about everyone else, but the last thing I like in the mornings are ravenous individuals shoving me to get ahead in line for food.Sky on 57 has less options but makes for a more dignified experience, IMHO.2. Late night supper - for late night munchies. It serves up a decently extensive dessert/food menu past midnight. Not gourmet, but does the job when you are hungry and stranded on the island known as MBS.3. Drinks - now, this deserves 4 stars at least! Good selection, bartender was knowledgeable enough.",
