They don't charge for GST and service, which is a plus point.My favourite items on the menu are the salmon cream pasta, the all day big breakfast and the sharing platter (their sides are really awesome). The salmon cakes are also worth a shot.Service staff are really friendly and as the management is social-media savvy, checking in on Foursquare can unlock you discounts and special offers!",

Food can be a little pricey ($120 for 2 mains, 3 sides, 1 pitcher of lemongrass drink and 1 dessert). Food is acceptable.",

Ordered a half platter \"I see seafood\" platter and it came with 3 measly pathetic small prawns, insufficient fries, 4 exact calamarai rings and charged $36 for it. This place is seriously in bad decor, overpriced and mediocre service. I don't see any reason to visit here at all. East coast is littered with places with better food and better ambience than this place. Don't bother coming here.",

    "text": "The setting is very casual and relaxing. It was almost like eating at a coffee shop at the old housing estates. The good weather calls for some alfresco dining, Also, i noticed that the seats inside do kinda smell of food but the diners don't seem to mind. The first thing that caught my eye was obviously \"All Day Breakfasts\". Breakfast is one of my favorite foods. Runny Salmon Scramble-Up ($12.50)- Creamy scrambled eggs topped with lots of smoked salmon, warm toast by side. This was heavenly. The eggs were runny as promised and had a rich creamy texture to it. The salmon provided the slight saltiness that the dish required. Only downside is that the salmon didn't seem very fresh? Didn't have a very nice bite to it? Not chewy enough i guess.My Juicy Shrimp & Roast Pumpkin ($14.90)- A rich pink sauce of tender baked pumpkin, shrimp and whole oven-roasted garlic cloves. The linguine was more on the cooked side but the plus point is that it makes it really easy to swallow (trust me that's a good thing). I was basically gobbling mouth after mouth of pasta. The sauce was light and not too sour, perfect base for a pasta marathon. I could go on eating this forever.Knickerbooker Glory Sunday ($12.50)- Vanilla gelato with Peach Melba, almond stracciatella, sea-salt dulce de leche & jaffa truffle bar. Was a crazy ass dessert. Every mouthful is a burst of flavors and the mixture was absolutely exhilarating and surprising. Some orange, then chocolate then REAL vanilla ice cream (with vanilla beans!) followed by the taste of sea salt caramel and then hitting the sweet notes with the Peach Melba again. This is a must try.",

    "text": "The ambience and decor of the place isn't great, doesn't have a very welcoming feel nor is it stylish - the concrete walls are painted in terracotta and left plain with wooden tables and chairs being the main decorative item - resulting in the noise bouncing off the walls and echo-ing around the cafe. \u00a0The food however is pretty decent - the burger and wedges were good, moist and tasty although the burger could have been a slightly bigger portion for its price especially when you compare it to the big breakfast your neighbour is having next to you :P \u00a0I had the ugly salmon cakes which were pretty good - the mash they used in the cakes were very buttery and tasty, but it could have done with some batter and extra time in the pan - and also some cheese I think. \u00a0Although simplicity in cooking is the key, these salmon cakes lacked a little depth in its flavour. \u00a0Otherwise no complaints, great portion size, and the salad that came with it was fresh.What I found slightly strange was the iced mocha that I ordered - it really wasn't milky enough, as you could tell instantly from the colour. It didn't taste bad, just not what an iced mocha is really! There was an overpowering taste of chocolate / cocoa powder - bit too much for my liking.",

It's also a pretty good place for gatherings as they do cater to large group settings too. I think it's best if you called to reserve instead.I would recommend their soups and desserts. It not only tastes good, it looks good too! I love how they will spend time and effort in plating their food before serving it to you. A good place to try out if you haven't.",

But once you discover it, you can be sure you'll keep going back for more. Wait staff and friendly and very efficient, always popping to check if you need something and even when they're at they're busiest, your orders come decently quickly. Being a pet friendly joint, you can expect many of our furry friends lazing around while they're owners enjoy their meal. The biggest draw, for me, has to be their decently prized all-day breakfast sets that are huge on portions and good on your belly. The perfect place to nurse your hangover in fact.",

It's a home-y fun place where I can meet up with friends and just chill out (while stuffing our faces, of course). One of my favourites is the Bangers and Mash -there is also the Ultimate Bangers and Mash but I have never had the guts to try it! The last time I was there I also had the high tea set of four slices of cake + tea/coffee. It was dessert overload, but I regret nothing.They're also active on Twitter, which means that if you follow @thegardenslug you can be constantly tempted with photos of food and updates on their specials. We once even made reservations for a table via Twitter!",

The shop has an interesting name and logo, and it would be hard to miss the shop.This bistro restaurant menu is pretty simple to understand and the deco and interior design are cosy and warm. They provide free wifi and some reading materials for people who wish to laze their afternoon away. Food to try is their fish and chip, the fish is tender and juicy, very well prepared, the crust is crunchy giving the extra texture. And do try their signature chocolate popsicle ! It looks just like a popsicle but it is in chocolate flavor. It is even served with an ice cream stick.The owner is friendly and the price range is affordable, definitely a great place to chill out with friends \u00a0or date with you loved one.",
