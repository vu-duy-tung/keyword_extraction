    "text": "This is a value-for money food joint that serves fusion western makan with good taste. We had* Ayam Bakar - which to me is essentially fancy satay on a plate. It has the raw onions (slices), ketupat (cut into smaller pieces and satay sauce spooned over the meat. I found the sauce a tad too sweet and the chicken chunks not as tender as I would like it. Not bad but not a dish I would order again. * Arrabiatta Prawn Pasta - I originally wanted marinara sauce with Chilli padi. The lady at the counter looked at me funny and asked, \"So you want Arrabiatta sauce yah?\" Heh, I trusted her and yes, it was spicy tomato sauce. I found the pasta a tad TOO al dente but the prawns were large and fresh and beautifully grilled! Very happy with the pasta overall. * Truffle Fries - daughter insisted on having this and the serving is a large serving of hand cut fries with generous mix of truffle bits and slices to give the whole pot of fries adequate taste. * T-Jar - their version of tiramisu. Theirs is not with sponge cake but a denser chocolate cake. The jar is a pretty substantial size and one jar was enough for my family of 3. They have other very tempting mains that I don't have enough stomach space for which I wanna try the next time. The",

    "text": "This kind of place reminds me of saveur, good quality food for a cheap price. Why a 3 star? Well there are small things that overall lowered the experience a bit. First the tables are awful. They are very light and wobbly which makes you feel like your eating during an earthquake. Add to the fact that the tables are really dirty. Maybe I'm ocd but there is a good portion of dust and food crumbs accumulated on the second bar. Then the water I was given had some kind of food crumb floating around. HmmmmOn the food, the ayam bakar is nice but they serve it with cold cubes of compressed tasteless rice(ok I suppose this is the traditional way to make but don't like). It's better to just leave that out. The cremoso which is a carbonara says there is egg yolk. When we asked the waiter he didn't see understand what we are asking which is if it's mixed in the sauce. He took the dish and returned with the same dish. Some places have the egg yolk on top(Concetto). It's good. It's very good. But actually Concetto does it better. You order and pay at the counter which is ok since they don't charge gst and service fees. I still think I would return back to try other things. I hope the venue is upgraded by then.",

    "text": "A new cafe opened just last month, 'Krave Cafe' is definitely a place to reckon with! Small yet cozy, it fits around 9 small tables. Apparently run by a local celebrity Chef Sufiyan and friend, Chef Helmi. Both the chefs were there when we lunched in. Honestly, I could not recognise their faces since admittedly, I do not follow Malay celebrities/shows. Sorry, chefs! It was my colleague who pointed them out. I'm impressed that they were quite friendly. Coming to the food, I must say, whatever I've tasted were just tip-top fabulous! It was my colleague's 2nd time dining there and she insisted that I try that place out. The place was quite full when we reached there. What impressed me next was how fast we were served. Noted that none of us ordered a big course meal, since we just ordered some fried snacks and desserts. We ordered the Chempedak Creme Brulee, Mars Attack and the fried Otah-Tah. The creme brulee was nice. Each serving has one chunk of Chempedak flesh inside. I just thought that it would have tasted even better if it was sweeter. But my colleague thought it was just right. *shrugs* To each their own, eh? 'Mars Attack' was served in a cup of halved bars of Mars chocolates, battered and dipped fried, served with vanilla ice-cream. Nice! I liked it. Too bad they didn't do it with Snickers bars instead. Always preferred those to Mars. Coming to the Otah-Tah... bloody hell! On my first bite, I finally understood why I was coerced into coming to this place. They were marvelous! For you locals, you know what 'Otah-Otah' is, no? Well, these were dipped in a specially seasoned batter and fried to perfection. I was hooked. They served them with a small serving of mayonnaise. You can easily ask for chili sauce if you prefer that instead.All I can say is that next time, I will definitely not refuse an invite to this cafe again.",
