    "text": "Surprisingly empty when we visited on a Sunday afternoon at 12. Menu is intriguing and every plate was exquisitely plated - I watched the adjacent table order the granola with yogurt and fruits and it was extremely prettily plated. I had the eggs en cocotte ($19), which was satisfying but not mind blowing. Eggs were nicely poached, and I liked the doubanjiang hollandaise. The truffle mash was slightly hard and flavorless though - was not a fan. I really liked the jamon soldiers; they went really nicely with the luscious yolks. My friend had the chili crab scrambled eggs ($20). The corn cakes were creamy with intact corn kernels in them. The scrambled eggs tasted more like chili than the chili crab sauce (which probably contains more tomato). Also tried their interesting-sounding Organic Chai Soy Almond Latte ($7), which was not bad, but slightly too sweet for my liking. Total bill came up to $49.",

The food menu has a few good items albeit a bit short, nothing to really write home about.In a nice location with good outdoor seating. Great view of the creek right next to the bar. Laid back atmosphere in the evening.Great beer list, broad selection. Enough to keep you entertained on repeat visits. Cocktails could be a bit better.",

    "text": "We tried this place after reading reviews of how pet friendly it was in a Singapore Pets magazine. The following day we took one of our dogs to the Pet Expo at Changi exhibition centre. For a dog that was born feral he really did a great job coping with the huge throng of people and pets. After a couple of hours my patience had worn out more than his had and we decided to reward him with a trip here. Parking is at a premium in this area, so I left the old girl \u00a0( my old Merc) with the valet parking attendant and watch him smoke the tires off into the distance. As we walked up, a member of staff told us that the NEA had paid them a visit and they were not allowed to be as dog friendly as they would like to be or the magazine article said. Oh Well. Not the best of starts.We got a table, actually an oil drum right on the edge of the outdoor area and perched precariously on some uncomfortably high stools with the dog just outside of the \"official \" \u00a0restaurant outdoor area but close enough that many people paid attention to him. Anyway, back to the Tuckshop, yes the seats were uncomfortable but the place has a very good vibe and the Archipelago beers selection went down a treat. The Summer ale being our particular favorite. We just ordered appetizers to eat, Pan Seared Ribeye Tataki with Tomato Salsa and Poppodom and the Chicken Curry. Both were instant favorites for a return visit with hopefully the Roasted Chio Bak with Spice and Vinegar. Dip being back on the menu. We had left room for dessert, which is a choice of four different ice cream sandwiches served with a shot of Baileys with Milo Dinosaur powdered on the top. I had the marshmallow while my wife had the mint. Both were perfect with the Baileys and Milo Dinosaur powder being an unexpectedly good flavor of dessert. Our dog attracted lots more attention from both Locals and Expats as well as the staff who throughout were friendly and efficient without being too attentive. Shortly afterwards we summoned the Valet Parking attendant and before we knew it the old girl screamed into view. We headed home after having enjoyed our day, but not quite as much as our dog did. Note to management: please get the approval you need to make the Tuckshop pet friendly.",
