    "text": "Nice pub right in the middle of Clarke Quay to grab a whiskey and people watch. Interestingly enough, they have a minimum age for the interior area. To add to that, the minimum age is different for male versus female. *mind blown*Nice assortment of whiskey selection, but don't expect anything rare. Like all of the drinking establishments around Singapore, prices are going to be fairly steep for a stiff drink. Service is good and the staff kept the drinks flowing pretty well all night. They had a live band here playing pretty good cover of top 40s plus some classics. Pretty good vibes and there were a few ladies dancing, but most of the action seems to be next door at one of the adjacent clubs.",

I am not sure why one would go all the way to Singapore for a Scottish themed bar and restaurant, but the natives like it so, whatever. I enjoyed myself, but I was on a first date and it went well, even better later on :-)She helped me understand why the airport code for Singaporeis SIN;-0",

That's pretty damn steep.There was a live band which wasnt that great. Then again, we sat outside so maybe thats why the audio wasnt good. I did like that they had a TV screen which projected the band performance indoors though :)Service was slow too. Pretty sure there are some better bars around!",

    "text": "Located in a pretty happening plaza in Clarke Quay. There's lots of lights and modern looking buildings in the area. I stopped by on a weekend night to go drink with some Singaporean friends.The bar was pretty busy but the hostess put us on a small table outside immediately.There's some kind of promotion going on with Guinness, but it was very confusing because a Guinness girl would come up to us and only take orders for Guinness, then relay the order to the bar. Except for that we already had a waitress so those orders were ignored and we had to go through our normal waitress again. Huh? What exactly is going on here?There was a live band, which was alright. You could see them displayed on video screens outside. I heard some other band while I was going to the restroom, but they were TERRIBLE. I'm not sure whether it was the same band or the band from the neighboring bar which had a shared bathroom.I got a ginger beer cocktail which was alright. As always, alcohol in Singapore is pricey, I think mine was somewhere right under $20. Service is slow and it's hard to grab their attention. I think there is better in Singapore!",

    "text": "Touted as a Scottish pub, the most Scottish aspects of this place are the extensive whiskey list and the kilts worn by the staff. \u00a0I must say, however, that my experience with Highlander was pretty positive. The pub grub was delicious, albeit being expensive and marred with small portions. We had the Kobe Beef Burger and Whiskey Prawns, and enjoyed both immensely. The resident band was playing that night, and, while they were certainly not playing music I would normally enjoy (i.e., Evanescence!), they were great performers and their high energy was infectious. By half past eleven, the dance floor was filling up and the atmosphere transformed into party mode. As with most watering holes in Clarke Quay, expect to pay premium prices for the booze and food. Also, Clarke Quay is not always the most conducive place for a casual night-out, what with the hoards of bar-hoppers brushing against your table as they move along to the next stop, and the loud music coming from the surrounding nightspots. It is certainly fun, but you have to be in the mood for a riotous time.",

    "text": "Probably the only place in Singapore you can find Haggis being served, Highlander is unique in that both the food and drinks on offer are great. The selection of malted whisky is quite comprehensive and they also happen to have a very nice selection of Kentucky bourbons, something you don't really see much of here in Singapore. The food is great and you should really try their shepherd's pie, which is served piping hot and filled with chunky meat fillings. Service was friendly and very brisk, you don't have to really wait long for your drinks to arrive, even when there's a large crowd.",

This place has one of the worst service staff teams I have ever experienced in singapore. Time and time again I have been served by black-faced waitresses who toss menus at me and seem to have an attitude if I dare ask a question about the menu. The second time I ever came here, i ordered a dozen kamikaze shots to share with two others.. I shot six shots one after another (because they weren't strong I downed them like juice). Six shots in 15 mins should be lethal, I felt nothing. Drinks are pretty watered down if you order anything that isnt straight up.Dont get wrong though, the live band is pretty good and the manager is very sweet. But my goodness, dear waitresses please smile and be a bit more hospitable.  One star for the band and one star for the atmosphere.",

And for me, it's Highlander in Clarke Quay.I mean, theoretically, this place should activate my gag reflex immediately. It's prime Clarke Quay real estate and going here on a Saturday night is a little like having a ringside seat at a vomiting competition.But, for the same reasons, it's a pretty great vantage point to see carnage comparable to a monster truck derby. And it has the added benefit of an ample smoking area and a really good whisky list.So sometimes, when I'm bored, and it's late on a weekend, and all the usual options just seem too much trouble... I'll come to Highlander, sit and chat with friends over a good single malt and watch modern society at its absolute worst. Bliss.",

Service is rather prompt though i dont blame them for 5 minutes slower to get my drink. This bar tends to get more crowded as night throttles on.  Love the performances! Thats what we are there for.
