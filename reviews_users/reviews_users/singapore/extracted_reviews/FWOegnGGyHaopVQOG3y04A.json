    "text": "One of the few places in Singapore that you can order and be completely assured that everything is vegetarian. The main attraction here are steamboats with your choice of broths (I liked the mushroom and the Tom Yum broths) with a large buffet table of fresh items like vegetables, lotus root and tofu to add to your pot. There had to be over 10 types of sauces to choose from, from chili sauce to peanut sauce--I combined a few of them and they were delicious. Also available were unlimited baskets of vegetarian dim sum which is hard to find, though I have to say, the dim sum was not spectacular. Service was very friendly. We had to travel quite a ways to get here but thankful to find a vegetarian restaurant.",

    "text": "Old school vegetarian Chinese cuisine in Liang Court. Food generally tastes ok with some dishes better than others. We particularly like the taro/yam dim sum and soup. Overall, comment would be that there was too much flour-based items / mock meat and not enough actual veggies, tofu or mushroom. Price-wise is what you would expect from a sit-down Chinese restaurant",

At times it felt that the restaurant is mainly for group of people and not individuals. On the website it say Smart casual is the dress code but saw people in shorts. Ambiance is very good.",

    "text": "This quaint highly rated vegetarian restaurant in the Orchard Road shopping district does a very nice job with local produce and with a Chinese flair. \u00a0I've had two business dinners here and the quality of food is consistently high. \u00a0Both occasions we've had the set menu (S$55 pax) which was 6 or 7 courses. \u00a0The restaurant is primarily aimed at vegetarians but will veganize even the set menu when asked. They do serve beer but not hard liquor I'm told. \u00a0We enjoyed fresh juices tonight. The building in which they are housed has been under construction for some time now. \u00a0Hopefully they'll be done soon. \u00a0Otherwise I may need to purchase a hard hat. Credit cards taken and reservations are suggested. \u00a0Enjoy.",

    "text": "Oh I love this place :p Actually, it seems like I love most vegetarian places! Lol. Perhaps cos they have to be more creative with food for it to be palatable to people. Not very cheap though.We arrived on a Friday night around 8:30pm or so.. Still had to wait a while for a table! Their soups were excellent - bamboo spinach soup with enoki and vermicelli (mm!), and white asparagus soup with mushroom, potato and celery bits. $7 and $11/serving, respectively, if I recall correctly.Our appetizer order of vege satay ($16 for 4 gigantic sticks) came first, actually, I think. Skewers of mushrooms, peppers, beancurd skin, water chestnut.. Quite filling. And delicious peanut sauce :p I love peanut sauce!I think my favourite out of all the dishes was this phyllo pumpkin roll - SO GOOD. phyllo is amazing. and so is pumpkin!! Came with some sweet (maybe also pumpkin? or mango) sauce.Edamame beancurd w mushrooms and xiao bai cai were very interesting.. The sauce had something that I couldn't identify, but was delicious! Gave the mushrooms a different flavour. Very soft beancurd, different texture thanks to the edamame.Side note - we were at a 2-person table and there was a family at the table next to us (it was quite close by) and this kid was so intrigued by us/our food. A little creepy but kinda cute :p",

    "text": "Yum! This is my favorite Chinese vegetarian restaurant because fresh vege is at a max and mock meat is at a minimum. there is a small selection of dim sum available for takeaway, but really, the thing to go for here are the fresh stirfries--fresh lotus bulbs are sweet and crunchy, there are more varieties of mushrooms (that never saw the inside of a can--monkeys' head with chilli is a favorite). They do try to bring in fusion elements but those are a bit of a hit and miss--try them anyway, just don't let the waitresses oversell.If you can't decide what to eat, there are good set menus for pairs and larger groups. It is a bit difficult to find though--if you drive, just park on the 5th floor and find their entrance direct from the carpark. Otherwise, find the Liat Towers lobby behind Hermes and take the lift.",

    "text": "I had a healthy phase about 3 or 4 years back where I tormented everybody with my sudden fascination for all things vegetarian. So for my birthday, my mom decided to make reservations of at LingZhi for the family dinner - that \u00a0meal probably convinced quite a number of people that being vegetarian was not impossible.Mock meat is probably a word spat on in this restaurant. Instead, they emphasize a lot on using fresh and natural ingredients to create flavourful and tasty dishes. Crispy mushrooms tossed in a fresh salad, lightly saut\u00e9ed lily bulbs and egg noodles with crunchy vegetables - you get all the flavour without the guilt. Price-wise, it is reasonable in terms of the quality of food we got. My only lament has nothing to do with the restaurant but my visit got me thinking that we have very few places in Singapore that offer such standard of vegetarian food at more affordable prices. \u00a0A pity.",

Wonderful selection of mushrooms and veggies. They even have a few cooked dishes in the buffet line as well as some nice desserts and definitely try the herbal Yuzu tea.",
