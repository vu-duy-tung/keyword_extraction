    "text": "Best bang for your buck in this category. Isteaks has zero atmosphere, after all it is a converted hawker but this is the best cheap steak in Singapore to me.Both served at location or delivered at your house, the quality of the food is pretty consistent and the prices are wallet friendly, which explains the often long line during weekends.In addition to the steaks which are good for it's price (surely you can't compare with high end steak houses), I like the fact that they offer a wide variety of sides. Downside is that you need to pay for water.I have not tried any of their non-steak dishes but with their decent steaks and considering their name, I stick to what I know is good.",

    "text": "Place seems clean but they charge $.30 for a glass of water. Doesn't matter that we both bought a drink each already, I despise places like this, places that charge for plain water. So one star.But I have to bump it up by a star to two because they did not charge service charge as patrons queue to order and pay, get their own utensils and drinks (compared to other places who have the gall to charge 10% service charge and make you do all that).Ordered large plate of chicken (one piece or mushroom chicken and fried chicken) with side of fries and corn and one carbonara. The fried chicken was good but way way too oily. The mushroom chicken (grilled) was decent. The fries were not bad and corn was good. The carbonara was pretty decent (taste and al dante noodles) except my wife didn't want any of it. Found out why when she gave me some, it was very fatty and the fatty parts were rubbery hard! We ordered coffee and iced tea, both not bad.Overall it feels like an \"atas\" (\"above ghetto\" in English) food court/centre western food stall.",

I'm glad the quality and price remained after the move from the hawker stand. \u00a0I recommend getting the steak sauce on the side or not at all - why ruin a good steak with some sauce?",

I may not have noticed what the beef patty tasted like. I may go back to check out the steak, though. You never know. (PS: Has anybody ever had this happen: you walk into a restaurant in Singapore and they look at you and go \"Yes?\" My recommendation would be to take a crazy wild guess and assume people want to eat.)",
