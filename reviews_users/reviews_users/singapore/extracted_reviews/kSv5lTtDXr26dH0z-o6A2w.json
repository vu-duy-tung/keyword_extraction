The portion given for the noodles is rather generous (for both the noodles and the meat), and would definitely make a filling meal. They also have a number of interesting sides such as the fried intestines, duck tongue, and other animal parts (organs!!\u00a1) which may take a little courage to try but will not leave you disappointed!",

I work and live near by, and seriously, this is place is the most \"authentic\" Cantonese restaurant in the area. It's not too expensive either, another plus.The first time I was here, I had dimsum with my colleagues. A few of them have been here qutie a few times already and highly recommended the BBQ pork pastry. Now, don't get confused! There are 3 different types of BBQ pork on the dimsum menu, but the pastry is the one you should be looking for! Buttery and flakey on the outside with hot-pipping BBQ pork on the inside. The fried shrimp bean curd here is quite nice as well. The typical shuimai, hargow, and coeng fen (my dimsum must-haves) were mediocre for Hong Kong standards but surprisingly good (aka no leftover frostbite) for Singapore standards. Sadly, dimsum is only offered during lunch times. I've also had the congee here, which was quite nice. The price tag seems a bit steep at $7-9++ a bowl, especially when comparing to the hawker center across the street ($3), but hey! you get what you pay for...meaning, there's AC. The congee here isn't too thick or watery and can be personalized to your liking. I selected the Two Treasure option: century egg and sliced fish. Overall, a simple reasonably priced restaurant that I'll stop by whenever I need to get my congee and dimsum fixed on. P.S. Please don't criticize my spelling of shuimai, hargow, and coeng fen--all taken from the dimsum article on Wikipedia :D",

The portions are quite small.The restaurant was about 20% capacity when we dined and there was a lady that pretty much just stood there by our table watching us eat. Talk about awkward.None of the waitstaff spoke English - a bummer for the Chinese-challenged bunch, myself included.Must come back and try the dim sum but for the regular dishes, probably not worth a re-visit as you can find similarly good stuff for half the price and twice the portion not far away.",

Reservations are highly recommended. Otherwise be prepared to queue or be turned away.We had:1) Deep-Fried Beancurd Skin Roll ($5.20): crisp and juicy2) Steamed Pork Dumplings ($5.20): bouncy, plump and juicy.3) Steamed Diced Mushroom Dumplings ($4.20): my favourite dim sum item here, delicious in an earthy, chunky and chewy way. 4) Steamed Glutinous Rice ($4): soft, moist, and choc-a-bloc with minced chicken, salted egg yolk and dried shrimp. 5) Steamed Custard Bun ($3.90): oozy and smooth with the most miniscule grainy texture, was a very good rendition indeed. Despite the fact that my heart belongs to the chocolate-laced version at Lei Garden. 6) Century Egg & Lean Meat Congee ($7.20): a comforting bowl of delicate baby-smooth gruel, and loaded with wobbly century egg quarters and pulled pork.",
