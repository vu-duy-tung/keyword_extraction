    "text": "The cafe is quite capacious; allowing for a 40-50 patrons, I figured. An environment that suits group gathering, children & family and alike. Ladies will be delighted to couch in one of the comfy cushion sofa, available only a few; otherwise join others at the typical dining table. Without the aid of a waiter, patron will march up to the sandwich/bread/cake counters for their orders and pay at the cashier. The varieties are far from broad (Donq provides a wider selection) and the price may be a little steep for some while you may still find a few comparable to local bakeries. You may like bottled puddings as dessert or some dazzling cake slices. The desserts counter housed a couple of 5-6 tempting cakes, available in whole and slices. Unlike the US, Singapore outlet does not bake any green tea cake which I asked and neither could I find any sweet potato/pumpkin range. From what I gather, the bread range is no less different from its US outlets but in addition, it also featured a few from its sister brand Paris Croissant such as Monkey bread, Green Olive Boomerang, half Chocolate Ring et cetra. I pace up and down, scanning through the display counter over 3 times before placing my orders with the staff, mostly Koreans.Everything looks petite in size and this Rolling Chicken Sausage (S$1.90) is not spared. It makes a good bite-sized if variety is what you are looking for. I regretted buying only one, otherwise I could enjoy more of its intense smokey flavour and that crispy sausage skin. I'd highly recommend anyone to get one trying. \u00a0 Peanut fans will be celebrating with this palm-sized crumbly looking Soboro (S$2.30). If you think it is gonna be another plain sweet bread and pass up on this one, you will be regretted. Instead of sugary, there is a faint saltiness in them; the way I love salted caramel with a lesser degree of brine. The peanut bits add crunch to the buttered crumbles atop the bun. The light savory mixture came unanticipated though the bun can be a bit drying out in texture. If you are looking to rotate your candied peanut butter bread, this version is a good switch. Now I see why it has been a hit among the Koreans who care less about the 290kcal each.",

After ordering the adorable-looking Camembert Cheesecake and 2 lattes, I was given a buzzer and shoo'd from the register. When I asked about forks, I was hastily told they were \"around the corner\". However, they were out of clean forks and it was tough to get anyone's attention to get more. I was surprised the cheesecake is actually a very fluffy variety of cheesecake surrounded by yellow cake and topped with whipped cream. While there was a slight cheesecake flavour to it, it mostly tasted like whipped cream with the texture of a traditional yellow cake. Also, it was still frozen in the middle, so Im not sure how fresh they were or if the case was just too cold. The coffee eventually got delivered to the table (but you have to get your own sugar). It was so bitter it was undrinkable. Blech",

The bread itself has a crispy crust and a soft center, the best part is the crust does not get soft the next day. It retains its crispy chewiness. A star from me. Another favorite of mine is the cheese stick. The skinny dough stick is coated with emmental cheese and makes a great savory snack. The pain au chocolat, baton sucre and condensed milk cream bread are all equally good. So far I have not been disappointed by their breads and buns. I have not tried the cakes or desserts or proper food so can't comment on those.",

Depending on the day, the queue can be big but it gave me a chance too look at their savoury items.Once I sat down, the tiramasu was as good as I expected and a espresso coffee helped to wash it down. But how can I leave without trying something savoury.Back to the cabinet, I picked up a croissant for breakfast the next morning.Light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness.

Seriously - where have I been?So so so many of these baked goods are amazingly tempting, and we had many over the past week. I blame my visiting aunt, who was really just being nice when she brought over the first lot. Cinnamon buns, croissants, egg tarts... All flaky, all delicious.We visited again yesterday and not only bought us a bag-full of other stuff, including a very affordable cheese tart (under two bucks!) and a mini-loaf of not so awesome chocolate bread (okay so there was one dud, but only if you crave mega sweet, mega chocolate-chip-filled slices). And then we sat down for cake. Oh that cake.Fluffy earl grey cake, crepe-layered cake made into tiramisu, and a lemon tart/cake... hamazing.",

There were cute bottles of PUDDING on display, who can resist pudding?! It was slightly expensive though, $4.50 for one bottle. There were pastries and bread too, at the glass counters, the price range was a little up-market but still comparable with the cafes in town area. After all this is Wisma Atria (they replaced Din Tai Fung). It was near closing time but the staff was still friendly, maybe because it has just opened this week? I will definitely be back to sit down and try their pastries proper.",

    "text": "i like this place i really do but the price sets me back. \u00a0for e same amount i could probably have a nice meal in a fancy place. there is no order when e place is pack as this place is free seating, there is no need to queue for a table at e entrance. you can simply find e seat you like, stand there and make e diners at e table feel uncomfortable so they can leave right away after e meal. 1. e chicken and tuna with avocado sandwich is awesome. everything goes well together and comes in sliced into 4 slices in a cute cardboard box. 5* for packaging. (about $9)2. tiramisu pastry. soo goood. must-try for tiramisu lovers :) might end up a lil messy tho. i have cocoa powder all over my mouth and table. note to self : wear a bib when having this.3. seafood chowder in breadbowl. \u00a0e chowder was OK, im more impressed with e bread bowl. its kinda hard, not sure how to eat it as i find it hard to even cut it with a knife. \u00a0dying to sink my teeth into it, e barbarian side of me came out so i picked it up and bite it. *mmMmm* i like e chewiness of e bread! chuck e chowder and just give me e bread!4. strawberry and banana fruit smoothie. its good but for $9...... my wallet is screaming. im a fan but ill only come back if i have cravings for e tiramisuuuu!",

    "text": "Korean Bakery Why Seoul Expensive? Paris Baguette is finally here in Singapore! It has over 3500 stores in Korea, US and China. None in France though, go figure. (Wheareas PAUL is really from France.)Because it is newly opened, its self-service ordering system, service crunch, and lack of seats due to its popularity may throw you back a little. Customers were looking high and low for the menu sheet, only to find them lying around somewhere. Somewhere.Indulge in a lazy afternoon with its brunch items, the best seller being the Cheese Omelette With A Difference ($18.00, and what a name). The omelette with spinach, gruyere and feta cheese is quite cheesy and yummy, plain in its own way, and heartily satisfying. The cakes on my table - a strawberry cream Mille-Feuille, impossibly cute Wahaha Chocolate Cake, and Peach Tart (between $6.50 and $8.50), are extremely pretty to look at, but not so pretty to eat. Some dry, some lacking that delicate touch.",

    "text": "I mean, can they do anything wrong??It's hard to point out one particular must-have here at this oddly named Korean bakery, but you know you're in for good food when you're buying from a shop with an awful name. I've tried several of their pastries and cakes, mostly on takeaway, and I find that I'm always willing to come back because of their sheer skill and artistry in making them. Everything seems to be done so simply, yet tastefully, with that bit of creativity injected in it - the result is a definite good experience.One down side is that the prices can be pretty steep for what one may consider as an 'upmarket' bread talk (or a korean Tiong Bahru Bakery). Their mango pudding thing set me back about $4.50 for a pretty tiny jar, which was good but pretty expensive anyway. One cake I do remember though is this layer strawberries and cream crepe cake, which is really a whole crepe sliced into triangles and stacked on top of each other in the form of a cake. Surprisingly, it doesn't fall apart as easily as I thought it would, and it tastes really good too!",
