    "text": "Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place, as trying to locate a stall inside the overwhelming Chinatown Complex hawker center can be a daunting task. This place does not disappoint. I had 10 steamed XLB which costed me $5.50 SGD ($3.82 USD). As I slurped each of the delicate and succulent XLBs, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the broth has a sweet umami flavor. The skin was tender but strong enough to keep all the fillings in without breaking when I picked up the XLBs with my chopsticks. Many reviewers have compared this place's dumpling to DTF - an unfair comparison given that DTF is a huge global franchise. In my opinion, this place is way better than DTF. I would not hesitate to come back again and again.",

We went to Chinatown complex looking for the Good Beer Company but since it was dinner time thought it would be great to get some food too especially because we were in a gigantic food court.After walking around the food court for 10 mins, I found this little shop selling xiao long bao. The couple at the shop were hand making them as you order. They were selling them at 10 XLBs for 5.50 Singaporean dollars (incredible!) I ordered 10 to share with the hubby, we finish them in 2 mins and went back to get 20 more! They were delicious and much cheaper than restaurants like Din Tai Fung...etc.Totally recommend going there if traveling in Singapore!",

The xiao long bao are great, but you HAVE to try the potstickers. They take a little longer to fry up, but definitely worth the wait. The spicy dumplings are a close second. The hawkers are really friendly and never turn anyone away when they are trying to close. (Although once the sign goes off you'll only get xiao long bao.) I've noticed that there are a lot more fellow ang moh in the queue with me lately. Probably no coincidence that so many reviews start with \"I was going to Good Beer Company and...\"",

    "text": "All-in-all, Din Tai Fung still wins in my opinion, as I prefer the flavor of the DTF xiao long bao filling. The skin here was somewhat inconsistent, and if you weren't very delicate and careful, it would break, letting the soup leak out. Everything is clearly handmade fresh here though; you can see them hard at work in the hawker stall kitchen, making each dumpling one by one and steaming the baskets. Of course these are not as aesthetically pleasing as DTF, but if you're looking for soupy dumplings at an affordable price then this is the place for you.We also ordered one bowl of beef noodle soup, one plate of pan-fried dumpling, one plate of boiled dumplings, and one plate of szechuan spicy wonton. For a group of six, the total was just S$7pp! The beef noodle soup was very delicious, and I'd definitely order that on its own again. The pan-fried and boiled dumplings were excellent as well. The pan-fried is probably more unique and requires more effort to cook (also more unhealthy). The szechuan wonton is a unique flavor of vinegar and spicy oil, and it's not for everyone. It might be an acquired taste, but none of us foreigners were really a big fan of the szechuan spiciness with vinegar.",

I'm a huge xlb fan - used to go to the crystal jade steamboat and xlb buffet for both the steamboat AND the free flow xlb! & I've just returned from Taipei where I tried the original Din Tai Fung. My conclusion: this is comparable with DTF quality xlb in Singapore, for a better price point. The skin is paper-thin without being overly soft or breakable, and the soup folded inside the dumplings is tasty and steaming hot. We thought that the filling is more generous than DTF or other places in general (and the dumpling are similar sized), and similar-tasting. The dumplings are also made-to-order, which means you have to line up for a longer time as you wait for it to steam (or pan fry if you order guo tie) but so very worth it. Obviously it's in a hawker center so the atmosphere is nothing special to speak of, but it's great for a no-frills meal. It makes me sad to think that something so simple and so good and so cheap can't be found easily in the US :( P.S I gotta try this Good Beer Company everyone's mentioning :p P.P.S. The store is #02-135 for those struggling to find it as I did: it's near the edge of the complex! And across from Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken store of Michelin fame.",

Well, nearly 99% of the time because they tend to get over-hyped to the point that making small mistakes become so unforgivable. After all, the endless banter causes your brain to think they are PERFECT because of how they are marketed right?This probably explains my utter distaste towards Din Tai Feng (especially the two overcrowded spots in LA that supposedly has the best dumplings in the freaking area). Don't get me wrong, they are decent. Quite good at best...but nothing mind-blowing. So when people keep saying that Din Tai Feng is the ONLY to-go spot for GOOD dumplings...bile begins to form in my mouth.Fast-forward to Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao...you'll find two very friendly and hardworking PRCs (wanted to say Chinese guys but changed it PRC to purposely address the current stereotype and say these guys are freaking AWESOME; they should be culinary ambassadors) kneading dough and forming Xiao Long Baos (hereafter, XLBs) one after the other with their magical fingers. They don't even need to boast awesomeness and screw themselves up with a swollen reputation because witnessing them furiously at work to keep up with the line is enough indication that they ARE.Now one of two main reasons for visiting Chinatown Complex (the other being the Good Beer Company) and having their XLB on several occasions after Cindy Q. introduced it to our little gathering, I can safely say that $5 for 10 XLBs that taste great and pairs well with strong beers...is \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"/Definitely-recommendNOTE: I've had it 5 times so far (20-30 each time) and the best time is usually dinner after a long line. Why? I went at lunch and my 20 XLBs came from the chiller and the dough was a bit dry and chewy compared to the ones I've had during dinner where it goes straight to the steamer freshly made.Yelp 100: 36/100",

Not that I'm complaining, it was totally worth it! The wait actually allowed me to watch how the guy makes his tasty little packets of love. So I'm not a big fan of xlb that are very soupy - I know, I know, don't lynch me! - it's just my preference (and don't get me started on those tang baos). But don't get me wrong, the meat filling isn't dry by any means. I find them to be full of balanced flavor between pork and flour skin. For a little variety try them in different combination of sauces (soy or vinegar only, and mixed) and with/without ginger. Try with ketchup ... ok, just kidding. The other nice thing is the reasonable price of $5.50/10 pieces, come on. Great taste for a great price, go give this place a try.",

I ordered the XLB and spicy pork dumplings. Both were super delicious. The couple owners were so nice and helpful too. They made me feel very welcomed at their food stand.",

    "text": "$5 for 10, whether it be xiao long bao, guo tie, boiled dumplings or steamed ones.I was meeting Jireh H and Amanda L for a drink at Good Beer Company. I was early and craving dumplings, decided to walkabout to survey the offerings. Started seeing many tables had big bamboo steamers on them. Finally found the dumpling shop run by 2 cheery China guys.I started with an order of boiled dumplings. Once the others took a taste, they started really getting into it. We ended up ordering a few more lots of xiao long baos and an order of guo tie.The xiao long bao has a certain sweetness to it, I think it's Chinese wine. These and the pot stickers (guo tie) seemed to be the most popular ones when we were waiting for our orders. I prefer the xiao long bao and boiled dumplings to the pot stickers as I find the stickers a bit heavy because of the oil from frying. The dumplings are already quite resplendent with meat juices inside. People were ordering dumplings to takeaway in multiple boxes.I give 5 stars not because these are the best I've ever had but they are very yummy with a bit of a unique taste and well worth the price. There's also not much of a wait despite them being made up on the spot. You can see the guys rolling the dough and filling them while waiting..free entertainment!",

The pan fried dumplings and Shanghai spicy noodles were also fantastic. An excellent meal for two for $14 SGD. Pair with some Tiger beer for an over the moon street food experience. Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!!",

    "text": "After an hour into waiting in line for one of two Michelin star food stalls, Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle, we decided to pick up some soup dumplings to tie us over. The dumplings were fresh (they actually make them in front of you), juicy and the skin wrapper was delicate and thin. These were better than any that I've had at Din Tai Fung or any other soup dumpling restaurant, and it was only $6 for 10. Definitely worth checking out while you're in Chinatown.",
