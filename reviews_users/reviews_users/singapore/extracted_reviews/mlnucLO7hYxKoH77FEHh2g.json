The selections here is good as almost all the most popular hawkers are here. Set up is clean and great to come here during summer because of the air conditioning!I know it might be a little more pricey and might not be the real hawker centre experience. But for me the food here beats anything I have at home!",

Most of the places I have gone to sells the same dishes for about $4 while here all the food is is $7+. The crappiest part is that the food isn't even great. It's merely passable.Unfortunately, this place is convenient, clean and nice, and has a large variety of food to select from. I got the balastier bak kut teh at first and was extremely unimpressed with it (altho one must note that i've not tried the real stuff on balastier road so i'm not comparing to that one). The meat was chewy and the flavour did not go through to the meat. I've had a different version of this that was way better. I ended up still hungry and went to another stall to get some dimsum, but it was also not impressive. The dimsum is old and overcooked from having sat in the steamer for too long. The flavour was on the side of bland.Nevertheless, overall, the place is okay. Convenience, choice and cleanliness brings it up a notch from a two star.",

This posh-ly designed food court is full of options to suit your current craving.When I came here for the first time, I was amazed and in love with the chandelier and seating. Then with my succeeding visits, It feels cluttered. Especially with the crowd. I love their food selection here but with the layout of the place, it's really difficult to find vacant seating unless you look really close. When in a food court-a crowded one at that-it's a must for any alone person to be able to see a vacant seat so they can quickly chope it.With their food selections, it is definitely an \"A\". But with the layout, referring to convenience, it's on shaky ground.",

It is a pretty nice place to dine in, if not for the cleaners who are full of angst. They make the environment a little less comfortable to dine in. Also, the food is a little too overpriced.

And then Food Opera...where do I even start?Oh, I started at Lam's Signature and ordered the Abalone Noodles. It came topped with egg, pork, fishball and a skewer of abalone & scallop. You get to choose your noodles - I had no idea what to get and had the cashier choose for me. Whatever it was, it was hella tasty.Next stop was a juice bar...called Juice Bar. They make fresh juices. I ordered what the person before me ordered: the lime which nicely complemented my meal.My hubby had Hainanese chicken from Sergeant Hainanese Chicken Rice. I think he enjoyed it. I never got a chance to snap a pic of his dish.I love you, Food Opera.",

    "text": "If you're looking for relief away from the sweltering heat that is Singapore everyday and delicious food, look no further than Food Opera. This is a food court located in the B4 level of ION Orchard Mall. The comfort from the air conditioning here comes at a cost - the food is more expensive. But, it's worth it because we do have some winners that are worth trying. The first food item was their laksa. Next to the Chinatown Complex Hawker Center, the laksa served here is my second favorite in Singapore. It's less creamy than its hawker center counterpart, but the flavor was still just as intense. Notes of coconut, shrimp, lemongrass came through wonderfully. I ate this laksa twice during my trip. One because I really wanted AC, and two I love, love, love laksa. My cholesterol levels were definitely not good coming back home from this trip. Lol. The second food item was their BBQ grilled chicken. Whoowee, this was so delicious! You can actually see them grilling the chicken wings over an open charcoal flame, and that flavor just gets absorbed into this chicken. The wings were smoky and had a wonderful char. The skin was crispy and it was still juicy in the middle. But, the wings were quite small, and one order was expensive (like $1 per wing). The third food item was their Teochew fish balls in soup. The fish was fresh, pounded into a paste, and boiled into fish balls. The quality was definitely there. Great texture and flavor. Plus they had very hot chilis in soy sauce as a condiment. Spicy as hell. We tried other food and drink items here, but they weren't good enough to be mentioned. Maybe an honorable mention would be their ayam penyet. Definitely not as tasty compared to the one at Tekka Center, but the chili sauce coating the chicken was definitely tasty. I just wished the chicken didn't taste like thick fried batter on the outside and unseasoned chicken on the inside. I still think this was one of the better food courts to come to that served good food in the comforts of a mall. Give this food court a go. At least you won't be sweating like a dog here.",

We browsed around the food stalls before making a choice.Stalls that we tried:-Stall #5 \"Li Xin Teochew Fish Ball Noodle\": I got the fish balls with egg noodles (5.50 SGD). They offer a few variety of noodle choices and I picked egg noodles. It was pretty good and filling.-Stall #6 \"Ice Shop\": My dad and I shared the grass jelly dessert and there were a few toppings (3.30 SGD). There were red beans, tofu pudding, and mochi balls. Delicious and refreshing treat.-My dad got the chicken and rice set which included a small plate of stir-fry Chinese broccoli and soup. I don't know what stall it was from and I think his meal costs (5-7 SGD).We came during lunch time and it wasn't crowded when we arrived. The food court was getting busy when we left since office workers and tourist would dine here during lunch. So, I recommend coming here by 12:30pm.",

I stumbled upon Food Opera after 10:00 pm on a Saturday - \"shop until you drop\" was an understatement for me this day. I had bags in both hands from Pull and Bear, and Lovissa, to Mango and ZARA; I was famished. Thankfully, there were still a few vendors serving patrons. I ordered the seafood Char Kway Teow from Thye Hong - Singapore Fried Prawn Noodle. This was an inexpensive meal at SGD $6.80 (about US $5.00). Unfortunately, in this case I got what I paid for. The Char Kway Teow just wasn't good. On a positive note, this is a very nice and clean food court with ample seating. I wish food courts in the US looked like this. It's a great way to take a break from all of shopping you're sure to do at ION.I knew the food wouldn't be as good as hawker food such as Lau Pau Sat or Maxwell St., but this stop was purely out of convenience. Next time, I'll just continue my stroll down Orchard or Patterson an take my chances on street food vendors. There was a pizza vendor that looked really good; the deep dish made me salivate. Worse case scenario - the McDonald's is always open!",

It's definitely more upscale and cleaner than most hawker centres and each place takes credit cards and debit cards so it makes it easier for everyone if you don't carry much Singaporean currency on you.",

Not wanting to go out very far for food once we checked into the Marriott (literally right across the street via the underpass and MRT station), we got our first meals here. Compared to the food courts in the US, this place was incredible in terms of variety and quality, so much so that you'll need 15 minutes just to walk around the area to see what you want to eat. We went with some Singapore standbys:Chicken and rice: chicken was very moist, and love the chicken flavor of the rice itselfChar kway tow: nice stir-fried taste in the noodlesHokkien mee: ok, but I wish it wasn't so watery or soupyAll in all we spent about 30 SGD (22 USD) on our first meal. While you can probably get better, cheaper food elsewhere, it is also nice to have a convenient and air-conditioned place to eat. Remember to bring your own paper towels and wet knaps.",

    "text": "In the busy shop infested ION the food option is the Food Opera (FO), a concoction of \"pricy cheap\" eats, but, compared to home much better quality. \u00a0I began my food journey in Singapore here. \u00a0FO had my head spinning like an exorcist baby in a candy store! \u00a0All the choices and visuals (love the giraffe and horsey animal statues scattered about). \u00a0I found myself in a choice panic. \u00a0Should I have congee? Or Laksa? Fish ball noodle soup? \u00a0But wait! \u00a0Do I want something chill like Ice Kaching? \u00a0Or roast pork? \u00a0What's hungry man like me to do?!!!I wish I had this problem at home in the US!After thinking hard. The floating soy sauce with red pepper floating next to the cash register at 3rd Generation Laksa won my attention. \u00a0I immediately realized my painful 15 hour flight to Singapore was worth the suffering.While I cannot say it's the best Laksa in Singapore or the best prices ($S7 for a large bowl) this type of flavor and quality is nowhere to be found where I live in California. \u00a0I love the energy and vibe of FO. \u00a0It's fun to watch other people walking aimlessly and unsure of what to eat or the workers or those seated and what they chose to eat.I also tried the Rojak (spelling?) salad which composed of cool vegetables, fried doughnut (bread used in congee/jook), pineapple mixed with crushed dry nuts. \u00a0I thought it was too sweet but it was refreshing.As an encore, I had in iced Kaching w/Ice Cream for $S3.80 (maybe $3US?). \u00a0It was very refreshing with the shaved iced mixed with red beans and some kind of red jelly thingy. This dessert is located at a stand in the FO called \"The ice Shop.\"Word of warning, although there is good quality here, there may be better options elsewhere at other hawker centers. \u00a0This is just the beginning of my food journey here so I will use the FO as a barometer for other places. \u00a0Needless to say, I ate so much here that I was able to walk and shop for about 7 hours. \u00a0I've also had the Fishball noodle soup which is pretty decent too. \u00a0It's at the \u00a0Teochew Fishball Noodle Stall.",

I am torn between giving it a 1-star (which I really want) or 2-star (just because not all stalls are bad). The goodIt is really hard to think of something good here, though I guess it is pretty spacious (but gets filled up real quick) and looks clean with some art pieces scattered around. The not-so-goodGenerally very high prices for local street food. You can definitely get much better local food at lower prices in the usual food centers or coffee shops. But in the Orchard Road shopping belt, the choices are limited, unless you trek to Lucky Plaza, Cuppage Plaza, Far East Plaza or Orchard Towers and even Ming Arcade (really cheap and good nasi padang) for much more affordable local street food fares. Even though the stalls are supposedly the best, I am sure many will beg to differ. Somehow when the food is no longer cooked by the original owners, the standard is not the same. So you are paying close to $10 for something you can get for $3.50-$5 in the Orchard area or $2.50-$4 in the neighborhood area. The absolute worstOver-charging by not following the prices listed on the board. The worst offender is the stall selling nasi padang (Malay food). It has happened to me twice!When I asked about it, the staff just said \"oh the price listed is wrong, they just increased it\". This happened a few years ago. Recently I ordered from Luk Yu Teahouse (dim sum and Chinese dishes) stall. The prices listed are not also accurate as GST is not included. Now you know in Singapore, most prices include GST, or if it doesn't, it is always stated exclusive of GST. So I got a rude shock when the bill was not what I thought it would be. And this was for take-away. Although the amount is small, I just do not think it is right. After all, it is about the principle. So I guess I will go back to not dining there again, unless I really have no other options.",
