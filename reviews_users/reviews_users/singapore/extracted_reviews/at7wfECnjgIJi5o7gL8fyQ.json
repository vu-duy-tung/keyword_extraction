The decor is amazing and the vibe is 1930s casual.. add in some of the best burgers ever and you have one helluva place! I had the kids burger (dizzy rascal), a bit of the \u00a0burning man, some cracka lacka corn, and house fries. The dizzy rascal was just the perfect thing for me. Tasty and not too meaty. I had a bite of the burning man and it had a real spicy kick to it. The corn.... well, it was definitely \"cracka lacka\" flavorful. The fries were the only that were boring... but whatever. You can't win them all. I'll definitely be coming here again though!",

    "text": "The best burger I have had thus far in Singapore! \u00a0Far better than a burger from Omakase in 3 major ways: 1). The bun is not soggy; 2). The beef was perfectly cooked - nice pink Medium; and 3). You could taste the bacon, as the slices were thick and smoky. \u00a0Naughty fries were also like a meal in itself. \u00a0The fries were interesting shaped - like long thin slices, and topped with chili beef and a spicy b\u00e9arnaise sauce. \u00a0Awesome. \u00a0 Now for what I didn't care for - the room, which looked like a tea room and not really my style. \u00a0And do not order their home made cola - it tastes nothing like cola. \u00a0But they have some beers and decent wines which go far better with the burgers so we shifted strategies. \u00a0Definitely go upstairs to the bar -1939. \u00a0Not sure if I should be breaking this into another review, but they definitely have a nice selection of booze and wines and their cocktails are solid. \u00a0 The Brooklyn was spot on - not too sweet, and they did a perfectly solid version of an old fashioned with Rittenhouse 100 rye. \u00a0So far, in the uber competitive burger world in Singapore, Potato Head is my fave - far better than Omakase or db Bistro.",

    "text": "Finally! After so much talk about Potato Head, I've managed to pull a decent excuse off my exercise regimen to come savour the burgers here.... and fries *ahem*.My friend and I came on a Sunday evening, and the good thing is that the place was not crowded; it was easy enough to get a seat. The problem is that it is located in Keong Saik, which means parking is always a problem. Hence, you can get a seat, but most of the time you're not gonna find parking.Tried: Rambo and the Burning Man burgers. They are very delicious, although I wish they were bigger. The buns are baked from whole meal, making this a little more healthy compared to the sin I'll be ingesting.- The Rambo burger is mutton/lamb, which they managed to mask over the gamey taste with lots of spices and I believe... a blue-cheese kinda sauce? I might be wrong, but it sure tasted like it. The combination of the sauces and spices sure gave it a pretty unique taste.- The Burning Man, now we're talking. A nice slice of beef patty well grilled with mayo and ketchup, topped with Californian jalapenos to spice up the taste. It was good. However, the burning man's jalapenos has some serious zing into it, which was fine for me but not for my friend... you have been warned!- Also tried the Naughty Fries, which are basically fresh but soggy potato chips slathered with a generous dashing of cheese sauce and beef chili (the Mexican kind). It literally was one of the best cheese fries I had so far.Rants: Wish the burgers could be bigger. The sizes of these burgers remind me of what you can get from MacDonald's (no not the big mac). That's the reason why I had two burgers instead of just one. And the prices of each burger is kind of expensive ranging in the $20s, without any side dishes or fries or salads etc.. Burgers are tasty, but the pricing still leaves a bitter taste. You have been warned!Raves: The whimsical theme of the d\u00e9cor leaves a nice chill-out location if you're into these kind of things. Food is very tasty and makes u craving for more! Oh the top floor has a nice rooftop bar which oversees much of Keong Saik.",

I've eaten burgers from Singapore to San Juan, from Stockholm to Santiago, and this is a delicious burger. I had the burning man. Extensive cocktail menu which was delicious.

The food here is super expensive. Like 25 dollars for a burger the size of my fist. My sister ordered the burger and I was so shocked at how small it was. \u00a0It was literally a slider size. \u00a0I ordered the wings, which were meant to be appetizers but I got them as my meal. They weren't your average buffalo wings. The sauce on the outside was a spicy sweet chili sauce and there were spring onions and deep fried onions as garnishes. The outside was crispy and the flavor was unique. \u00a0They were probably the cheapest thing on the menu so I was actually pretty satisfied with my meal. The rest of the people that I went with got burgers and I felt so bad for them because of how much money they had spent on the smallest burger ever. Go here for average burgers if you don't mind over paying for them.",

    "text": "Okay, I get it.I've never been to Potato Head in Bali, so I guess I'm missing out. But Potato Head Folk in SG definitely has that trendiness factor that you can't ignore. Keong Saik Road address? Check. Renovated shophouse? Check. The \"You're not cool enough to be here\" vibe? Check.I still wouldn't wait 2 hours to get in, but if you have the opportunity/luxury to visit before peak times, I will admit that it is quite a lovely experience.I started out in the lounge (\"Studio 1939\"), and it's totally my kind of bar. It's one of those spots that makes you wish you could chill there all day and make it your office. The backlit bar is really cool, the decor is pleasing to the eye, and the cocktails are strong (but expensive.)Then I transferred to the second floor (\"Three Buns Burgers & Cocktails\") where the food was being served. It seems like the theme here is upscale pub grub and fun cocktails. I tried the Baby Huey, and it was a messy, juicy, and sweet burger. Maybe a little too sweet. Like BBQ sauce sweet + a little more sugar than normal. I enjoyed their American pop culture reference cocktail names like \"Mary J Blige\", \"Kris Cross\", and \"Gin and Juice\" (laid back- with my mind on my money and my money on my mind!)Not sure how long they'll be able to sustain this buzz, but it's definitely a spot you should check out if you have a chance. Their music choices are actually pretty good (mix of old school and American rap) and any selfie taken here and uploaded on Instagram/Facebook will make the rest of your friends say, \"BO JIO!\"",

    "text": "From the people who brought us Potato Head Club in Jakarta and Bali, comes the smaller, quainter \"folkier\" version here in Singapore. I like the multi-level venue that offers a different experience depending on the mood you're in.On the bottom, it's a casual outdoor spot where you can take away a burger or scoff it there and then. Past the charming door hosts and up the quirky stairwell painted by Melbourne artist David Bromley, you'll come to the dining area where Burgers and fun pre-mixed cocktails are the order of the day. The staff here are delightful, making recommendations and having a bit of fun with customers. I love their colourful shirts and great attitudes. The burger I tried was pretty bloody delicious, though a little soggy on the bottom by the time I got through eating it. Next time I'd skip the sauces as not only do they create the soggy bun, but they add unnecessary sweetness for this savoury lover.One level up and behind a big black door is a colonial feeling cocktail lounge. Here it's about serious cocktails, both the old school and the modern classics as well as some Potato Head creations. I settled on a Martini and loved the glassware and the delightful handkerchief-like placemat it was sat on. If downstairs is for the young at heart, this space is for proper grown ups... or those of us who like to at least pretend we are.Up one more level and there's a rooftop bar. We didn't experience this as it was a scorching day and I felt as if my face might melt off. On a cool evening, this might just be the pick of the bunch. Guess I'll just have to make another visit, right?",

    "text": "Was here for the September instalment of the Yelp brunch. I'd picked this place as it promised good food in an interesting location, and the decors (designed by some Australian guy with a fear of flying...) had been much hyped about.Good things first: The decor was really quite impressive. We were seated at the Three Buns restaurant (second floor) and blue floral designs decorated the walls with artfully mismatched furniture and quirky statues, lending a whimsical vibe to the area. Most guests are seated in comfy-looking couches surrounding low tables, but our group of 14 got the large communal dining table in the middle of the room. The stairwell featured checkered tiles and more interesting statues/paintings, and the bar on the third floor reminded me of a 1900s Gentleman's bar- dark woods, heavy furniture, the most amazing collection of liquor in bottles of every kind. It was amazing and one could really appreciate the planning put into the design of this place.HOWEVER, the food was just ok. Yes, this is a burger joint, but we were a bit disappointed that they didn't really have any decent alternatives for those who were craving something else. I mean, usually there would be at least 2 sides which could pass off as a decent meal on its own? But anyway, most of us tried the Baby Huey (beef patty), Honky Tonk (chicken), 4 stories (double beef patty)... The verdict was that the Honky Tonk was the best due to the excellent pairing of the buttermilk chicken fillet and tangy coleslaw. We tried the Naughty Fries (potato spuds with salsa and a hell lot of parsley) and Sticky Date pudding too. My fries were alright, luckily not as bad as the one that Natalie had. The Sticky Date pudding was good but the portion was TINY for $8.Bad things last: The service was pushy and hurried. We had a reservation from 1230-1430, and while we did take SOME time to order, there was this guy who kept on rushing us and telling us that we had to get out by 2pm... He must have said it at least 4 times in 10 minutes. (Turned out that they got the timing wrong, we left before 1430 anyway) Yes, I know that you're popular, yes, I know that you have tables to turn, but it could have been conveyed in a less authoritative tone. I'm not sure if they even apologised after we informed them that they had gotten the end-time of our reservation wrong.Would I come back? Maybe... But a return visit isn't near the top of my agenda now.",

It would be a different story if this was Potato Head in Bali where you're captive in one club without other food options, but there are plenty of nearby eateries where you could get better bang for your buck. And the fries? Meh. They're not even fries. The food did not impress me one bit.I still regard the decor as top-notch and the rooftop area is still one of the best al fresco dining areas in Singapore.",

My Siak Daiquiri tasted like detergent. At $25 a pop, I expected a decent drink. Something refreshing. It was just full of syrup, stingy with the alcohol and just a bad taste altogether. I was bummed because it's such a lovely looking place. So I gave it a chance and asked if I could change my drink because I absolutely hated this dishwater. The server refused saying it was just probably not to my liking and they couldn't help if I don't like it. They would however add more yuzu syrup to make it taste better. I appreciated that gesture but I did not appreciate her reasoning. Some people sitting next to me overheard our conversation and told me this happened to them earlier too and they were told nothing could be done. So they left most of their drinks untouched. What a pity. Everyone just writes it off as bad customer service in Singapore. But I say, it's a top down issue. If the management don't educate and empower their staff, service staff will never bother to make savvy decisions on their feet. Until then... Drink up your lousy drink!",

    "text": "One of the best burgers I have had in Singapore only because I haven't been able to find a half decent burger around. We had the Burning Man ($24) - the burger in itself had an overpowering taste of the Jalapeno relish. The bun was nothing special - it neither reduced or enhanced the taste. Left me needing a huge bottle of ice water to wash down the taste.Honkey Tonk ($18) - the chicken was done impeccably well. Was crisp, tender and moist. Again, the bun was just a filler. Personally, not a fan of chicken burgers but the execution of this was pretty good. Likely to go back for this one.Finished off with a Sticky Icky Wicky ($8) - was moist and was not too sweet. Coupled with the fresh cream topping, it was nice and balanced and easy on the palate. The ambience was great. The entire Duxton Hill area has a nice vibe to it and I loved the setting of the entire place. However, the service was really bad. From the girl at the counter who was in an extremely sour mood, to our server who cold shouldered us the whole night.",

    "text": "*Great environment, but the food, while very tasty, is expensive for small portions*Invited a group of friends to join me for a casual dinner, and we all agreed that while the food here was really tasty, warm and full of flavor, the portions were far too small to justify the big price tag. \u00a0The cheapest burger, ~$15, was the kiddy burger, and the most expensive one was the $35 truffle burger. \u00a0Most of the other burgers ranged from $20-$25.It's strange because since the burger join is so close to a few different bus stops and MRT stops, it's easy to get to, and the atmosphere is great. \u00a0Chill music, nice wallpapering and overall a nice environment to go with friends or for a casual date.I'd love to give this place a 5-star review for their tasty burgers, but the food just isn't worth the prices they charge.",

I like that they take a different approach to food and drink menu and what they serve. Not typical Singapore where everything is essential the same..However, the execution of the food was just ok. I had the burning man burger which was spicy (which is great) but not alot of flavour and too much bun. Had the home made soda which was not all the good, but i like they don't go traditional. .

It was pretty packed when we were there (11pm-1am) but you can definitely find standing room.The drinks are AMAZING but also pricy. Cocktails average about $25.

They are called the Three Buns with a space serving gourmet bugers and cocktails, also for taking aways.Stairways between the levels are all hand painted with murals and hanging with art pieces.On the third level where we dine in the lounge bar as the dining room in level 2 was fully reserved. Atmosphere is definitely better if you are in the search for vintage seating, leather couches to chill and have catch up conversations with friends over for some snacks and cocktails.If you enjoy alfresco dining, head up to their rooftop setting where you grab a good dining environment with herb around.Their artisanal buns were freshly baked by local baker daily. Even their sauces, pickles and garnishes were made by their own chef with love. Priding their food with best quality prime beef and lamb from Australia as well as UK, be rest assure to sit back and enjoy the burgers. Do not be too shy to request how you want your patty to be done, be in medium or well done. Even if you are looking for different diet like protein style, they can provide patties to be wrap in lettuce instead of the buns.Baby Huey - $18The toasted demi brioche buns was airy and light, sandwiching 120g of prime beef patty together wtih cheese, lettuce, 'Notorious T.O.M. sauce', pickles & spiced mayo. Yummy!Baby Huey - $18Fun Boy Three was classified as burger of the month. With its name after the 80's pop band, grab it when you see it as they won't be in the menu for long.Fun Boy Three -$25This rich gourmet burger features 120g aged beef patty, roasted portobello mushroom, garlic, miso butter, smoked cheese, double ketchup, truffle aioli in toasted demi brioche bun. If you were to asked me to choose 1 between the 2 burgers, I would give this more voteFun Three Boy - $25Just 2 burgers with nothing else in our orders cost us about $55 in total which we thought was hefty to our pockets. If you don't mind splurging once a while for quality burgers, these gourmet burgers are actually good. However, do remember to make a reservation before heading down to avoid disappointment",

    "text": "I came here for the September YUBE, and our organizer kindly made a table reservation for us, which the waitstaff bungled up, and told us we had to leave by 2pm, when in fact, the reservation was made specifically till 230pm. Very unprofessional - really ought to do their homework.Aside from that glitch, everything service related was great.This place is beautiful and very Instagram-worthy. We didn't go to the ground floor, but Three Buns, which is the second storey, thankfully, air-conditioned. I don't think the ground floor is fit for eating fried, greasy things, for lunch.I got a Honky Tonk burger (chikennnn), and Nik T got the Four Floors burger (moooo). We got em to slice our burgers half and half, and boy I'm glad we did so, because I was going to order a Four Floors too.Four Floors was essentially two 100gm beef patties, instead of their usual 1 x 150gm beef patty. There was nothing memorable about the burger, despite the double cheese, triple onions, \"Notorious TOM\" sauce, and miso mayo on brioche. They didn't ask how we wanted our burgers, which was kind of strange. Our burgers came medium rare and pink, which is how I like em, but who knows? Someone else might like well done.Honky Tonk was the better of the two burgers. Buttermilk fried chikn patty, a very delish and tart coleslaw, hot sauce, miso mayo on a sesame seed bun. Did I like it? Yes. Was it better than Four Floors? Yes, sometimes less is more. The coleslaw made its presence felt, which made the burger very refreshing, despite the fried chkn. I have noticed that that tend to slather sauces on the burger buns, making the buns very soggy. We shared a Naughty Fries (bearnaise and beef chilli on fries), and I felt that it was especially naughty, given that the potatoes they used were probably green. My first bite into a Naughty Fry made me wince because of the sour and bitter. I tried a couple of other pieces, and some pieces, on and off, had that taste. Not cool. Meh.I had a Tom Collins to drink, and WHOA! It was strong, which was good, and made me laugh a lot. I didn't like that they used paper straws. Very annoying, as halfway through my drink, my straw went soft. Nobody likes hard things that go soft.Would I come back here again? Maybe for drinks.",

    "text": "Extremely hip and extremely pricey burgers and drinks in the former Tong Ah (\u6771\u4e9e) Eating House building. Now owned by guys that started the Potato Head Beach Club, kaya toast is nowhere to be found on the menu. I found the burgers pretty good even by American standards, with the brioche bun suitably soft, the beef cooked medium-rare and paired with a sauce that tasted like siracha and Tabasco combined. I was particularly amused by the names given to the burgers like \"Burning Man\", \"Rambo\" and \"James Brown\". The \"naughty fries\" are basically an interesting rendition of chilli cheese fries. The building is located at the intersection of Keong Saik Road and Teck Lim Road. It consists of 3 floors and the rooftop bar. The kitchen on the 1st, the restaurant is on the 2nd, the lounge (Studio 1939) on the 3rd and the rooftop bar right above.Formerly a red light district, the Keong Saik area is rapidly gentrifying, the next hip 'hood. I used to occasionally stop here to enjoy a kopi and very good kaya toast at this corner, and watch the world go by. In the evenings, they used to serve pretty decent \"zhi char\". (Kaya toast and zhi char have moved 50m away, see other review)I was particularly impressed by the restoration, attention to detail, and lighting of conservation building's facade, highlighting the 1930s art deco motifs. The restored spiral staircase inside also makes a good photo. It is said that the owner of Tong Ah Eating House sold the building for a cool S$8 million. That explains the high cost to enjoy my burger in a restored conservation shophouse. Burgers are now where I used to enjoy a kopi and a kaya toast or two. I do miss the old days, but a good beef burger is also definitely welcomed.",

    "text": "We came here in a group of 11 with reservations made. The food (mostly burgers) on level 2 (Three Buns) was good but not worth the price. I shared the Smoking B-Boy which was 150gm of beef patty with bacon and cheese and fried shallots (bawang goreng). The fried shallot was nice, gave a different dimension to the beef. For $28++, you just get a burger and nothing else. No sides or anything. I had a lemonade jerk which came with slices of grapefruit and lemon. It was fizzy and not too sweet. I could taste the slight bitterness of the grapefruit. I tried the sticky date pudding which was not bad but came in a tiny container. I nicked a bit of the \"chili fries\" which was also not too bad. The food is generally ok, but the service could be better or flexible. To be fair, it was only one wait staff who was that. The others were quite lovely. I was taken aback when the said wait staff flatly refused to do individual billing even before we ordered especially when we were a big group. Many eateries have started doing individual billing as it just made it easier for everyone instead of wasting time trying to figure out the cost. I have also been to places when they can spilt the bill even when it was just 2 persons dining. They need to play catch up in this aspect. The same wait staff was also very adamant about us hurrying up (close to 30 minutes of our arrival and we were settling in and looking at the menu, taking pictures and just trying to decide on what to order) in placing our order and telling us we need to vacate in an hour time. Again we were stunned. Never have I been to a place where the staff would actually say that. Usually if there is a time limit on the table, they would inform us once we got seated. Not after 30 minutes and then saying we have one hour to place order and eat. Thank goodness our efficient organizer kept the email reservation where it clearly stated our timing. It was for 2 hours, and if the kitchen cannot handle big group orders, then maybe they should not impose a time limit in the first place. And the place was fairly empty when we were there, definitely not full house with a line waiting outside. Another wait staff spilled my drink (too generous and filled to the brim) on me and my cloth bag (my ipad is inside!) but he was so apologetic and concerned that I just waved it off. And thank goodness it was a cloth bag so it was totally washable. I am not sure if I will return as the burgers were not spectacular (I would rather go to Roadhouse or &made or DB Bistro) and that antsy eager beaver wait staff certainly marred the experience in wanting us to just order, eat and go.",

    "text": "So far a big plus on the interior design of this place. It's like a hole in the wall gourmet food shop. This place is a throwback and has tons of anachronistic fixtures surrounding the place. From the \"Hamburglar\" figurines, the giant boombox in the corner and to the hits playing on the speakers from Krs One, what's not to love dude.Since I was sick I couldn't try the cocktails. So I opted for the ginger ninja, which I was surprised to see was made to order. Lots of ginger spice so it was awesome, could do with less sugar though.I had a burger the other day so I opted for the Honky Tonk, chicken sandwich. It did not disappoint! Looking at the menu , I just love the clever names they gave to their items.It's definitely worth a come back for me",

I ordered the Truff Ryder( a little more expensive than the other options, but so worth it!) and my friend got the Baby Huey burger, which she enjoyed very much too.2, The interior design. We had a great time by just looking at the murals in the building. 3, The service. Staff were friendly and prompt to help, thumbs up.I'm definitely coming back again!",

There's a rooftop bar. It's a cool place. But on the two occasions I went there, I found myself being pretty disappointed with the food. Overall all I can say was that the food was nothing special. It was not terrible but not quite worth the 20+++ price tag for a burger. The homemade cola and all were pretty undrinkable to most of us who ordered it. The service was bleh as well. I ain't gonna say much about this because I used to work in F&B and understand how it gets on the flip side. But bleh. Could be much better overall. It's alright. Nothing super and not a place you'd return to twice with the options we have in Singapore today.",

    "text": "Last week, I mentioned to a friend that I wanted to give Potato Head Folk a try. \u00a0He warned me it wasn't a good value. \u00a0After visiting this afternoon, we have to agree.I'm still a little baffled by the recipes and execution because the \"ingredients\" are all there. \u00a0Cool ambiance - either at a table along the shophouse sidewalk or upstairs in the retro/trendy/children's booked themed dining room. \u00a0They get high marks for location and the decor. \u00a0A look at the menu will make your mouth water. \u00a0It's loaded with gourmet sounding American burgers and grub, fresh ingredients, and trendy sodas and cocktails.Two of us had the Baby Huey Burger ($20), Burning Man Burger ($24), iced lemon tea ($6), Ginger Ninja carbonated soda ($7), House Fries ($5), Naughty Fries ($10), and a side of LL Kool Slaw ($5). \u00a0The total was $82. \u00a0Ouch!The small but weighty \"full flavoured\" burgers were served on brioche buns. The \"bespoke artisan\" buns (ugh!), while soft and fresh, bring absolutely nothing to the party. The Baby Huey, \u00a0their most standard cheeseburger, \u00a0was nothing to write home about. \u00a0The house sauce overpowered the beef. \u00a0 \u00a0It was however, leaps and bounds better than the Burning Man - \u00a0ruined by the overpowering flavour of the jalapeno relish. (and we both love jalapenos!). My friend looked unhappy with the Burning Man and offered me a taste. \u00a0 Thank God I only had the one bite because it \u00a0was UNEDIBLE. \u00a0Toppings should compliment the beef, but here they rule the roost. \u00a0And really not in a good way.The Naughty Fries were delicious. \u00a0The beef chili topping had great flavour and just the right amount of spiciness. \u00a0The twice cooked house fries could have been cooked longer during the second fry to crispen them. \u00a0They were under temperature, under crisp, and had a mealy texture. The lemon ice tea was sweet and refreshing. \u00a0The Ginger Ninja carbonated soda lived up to its description and definitely packed a punch. \u00a0After one sip it left me thirsty and needing water. The worst thing on the table may have been \u00a0the generous portion of LL Kool Slaw. I Love Cole Slaw and with high hopes of a gourmet slaw, I knew we had to try it. The cabbage and carrots were crunchy, but the one note celery flavour overpowered the other ingredients \u00a0 Nothing gourmet, cool or refreshing about this - just a big bowl of celery and vinegar flavor. \u00a0 We each had a bite and left the rest (approximately $4 worth) untouched.The Good: \u00a0The ambience (indoor and outdoor), the friendly staff, the Naughty Fries, and the lemon ice teaThe Bad: \u00a0Small hockey puck-like, dense, one-note burgers were each overpowered by the house sauce and jalapeno relish. \u00a0The bland brioche buns, The Ginger Ninja (Dear God!) \u00a0left us gasping \u00a0for water. \u00a0The one note celery slaw recipe needs reworking. \u00a0Mealy twice cooked house fries should have been crispier on the outside and fluffier on the inside.The Verdict: \u00a0Afterwards, while rushing out to buy bottled water at the nearby 7-11 (to wash down the burning $82 worth of celery flavoured regret), we discussed the lunch: \u00a0Cool dining room. \u00a0Overpriced mediocre food. \u00a0For half the price, \u00a0it would have been halfway acceptable. \u00a0But for $82, we agreed there are much better \"gourmet\" burgers in Singapore. Late this \u00a0afternoon, I SMSed our friend who warned us about the poor value and got a reply of \u00a0\"Told you so!\". \u00a0Oh well.",

    "text": "Based on my record this is my 4th UYE and it's potato head ..... 1st thing which I wanna talk is about the decor ... OMG I'm really loving it alot. I feel that the owners do put alot of effort on the decor it's so artistic and garden feel. As you can see I have a busy taking photos ya.We are seated at the 2nd level which is name as the 3 buns. Today we had around 13 pax and we are placed to seat at a long table. We are chatting and checking out the menu and the service crew interrupted us and say \"there's another booking so you have to placed your order and finish up at 2pm\"I find that this is kinda rude attitude for the service staff. It seems that we are obstructing them doing their business. Steffi is the organiser for this event and highlighted that she book it till 2:30pm and requested the staff to check and they came back and replied they have made a mistake but the attitude was bad. Not remorseful at all. Haiz .......Anyway, I don't wanna harp on it anymore. 3 buns serve burgers and the price is ranging from $15 to $28. Most of us would find a partner to share a burger as it seems that everything was so nice. Cindy and I shared the burgers.1) Baby Huey $20 which comprised a 150g beef patty with cheese, lettuce, pickles and spiced mayo. I had my first bite on the burger and it taste like a normal beef burger to me and nothing to wow about. The sauces are spread over the burger and it turns out to be alittle soggy. I don't fancy soggy bread and it taste awful to me.2) Honky Tonk $19 a burger with buttermilk fried chicken, coleslaw, lettuce, hot sauce and den miso mayo. I had my 2nd bite on the burger and it taste totally different from my 1st bite from baby huey. This burger is simply much better. The fried chicken is so crunchy and crispy and the condiments simply blend in well especially the season lettuce. This is simply awesome. 3) Ginger Ninja $9 is a drink with Ginger and soda concoction. I'm a Ginger person and i love the fragrant of it. i find this drink refreshing while other yelppers find it taste like teh halia. After our meals we are busy checking and the service crew are also busy clearing the table. I feel that they are in the rush. I would like to give them a 4 star but the service is really not up to the mark. At the end of the meal we requested for the bill to be splitted but the reply was no. Anyway we just paid our shared and poor sonya has to be the accountant. I may or may not re-visit this place again as the attitude of the service is really bad.",
