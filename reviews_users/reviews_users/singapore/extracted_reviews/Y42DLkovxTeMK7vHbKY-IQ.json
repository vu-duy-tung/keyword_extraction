    "text": "Most fun coffee shop in the world! \u00a0There are obviously less expensive more tasty coffee options around but where else can you drink your face off? \u00a0Literally. You go in, pay 5-7 bucks, order a Cold Coffee (hot doesn't work so they warn you), then you take a selfie. \u00a0The outcome is your selfie in the actual drink! \u00a0Not on some plastic lid but actually in your coffee. \u00a0What voodoo is this? \u00a0The coffee itself was just ok. I've had coffee all over the world so I'm a bougie snob but who knew my face would taste so damn just Ok! \u00a0One of those places in the world you must come once, take a picture/video, lick your face, then call it a day. \u00a0Tip: Please don't BATHE in cologne or perfume. \u00a0Seating is very limited, cramped, and itimate. \u00a0Don't be that guy who smells and over compensates with scented oils or whatever the heck that was.",

    "text": "People love taking selfies AND drinking coffee so why not put the two together? And so Selfie Coffee was born!Located on Haji Lane, Selfie Coffee definitely fits the hipster bill of the area - besides the hashtag in the name, the cute nature-print theme of the outside continues inside and upstairs where there are many spots for photo opportunities and that perfect Instagram pic. Surprisingly when we came on a Saturday morning there were no other customers so we had the top level and our choice of the upstairs seating to ourselves. While they offer both hot and cold drinks as well as desserts, the main attraction is the selfie coffee. You can only do the selfie coffee with the cold drinks, so we went for a basic iced Americano. They have you use a provided phone to take a selfie on the spot to print onto your drink, then give you a buzzer so you can wait outside or upstairs. When it was ready (voila!), our photo was presented on top of a thick layer of foam/cream...until we poked our straws through our faces, that is! It's a cool concept and a fun thing to try with friends or your significant other. The coffee was also not bad. Good for the novelty and the selfie aspect definitely draws you in, but for the price, a return visit is probably not necessary (especially since the woman who served us was not particularly friendly either...).",

This shop is located on a long street full of bars and souvenir shops. There is so much to see here. The walls on the building has lots of cool graffiti artworks to take pictures too. This shop is very small but it have two floors. A must stop for all tourists when visiting in Singapore.",

Remember that they do not have toilet paper or soap in the restroom so be prepared with some sanitizer!Price? Little pricey at around $10 per item, but they include the picture printed on your coffee & compared to American branded coffee sold in Singapore (Starbucks, Peets) it seemed pretty reasonable.Location? Cool alleyway, a little difficult to find the place unless you're actively looking for it though.Overall? I thought it was great, but really a one time thing. Nothing really calls me to return unless one of my friends wants to try it. Super cool idea though & I'll be sure to tell my friends to visit if they're ever in town!",

And yes, the selfie foam is edible! I have no idea how they do it, but it never fails to impress me. I've only had the iced/frappe styles, but each time I thought they tasted pretty good.However, I have to deduct 2 stars because of their bathroom situation. I noticed there was no toilet paper left so I went down and alerted them, only for the employee to say: \"Oh, we don't supply toilet paper.\"So... you're not going to even try to remedy the situation? I just found it a bit odd, considering they charge over $8 for these coffees, they're running their AC at a comfortable temperature, and they probably pay heaps of rent as they're on popular Haji Lane. There are no excuses for not having toilet paper on the premises.Thank goodness for 7-Eleven next door, which had tissues I could buy. Because when you desperately have to take the Browns to the Super Bowl, you'll do whatever it takes! (Yes, I went there.)",
