    "text": "One of better Indian restaurants in Orchard Road area. The d\u00e9cor is more rustic, and the food is not as refined as at the 'celebrity' Indians (like Rang Mahal, Song of India, Punjab Grill, Yantra) but it is much more satisfying - like a good old traditional French dish at a top bistrot vs. a beautifully-plated and highly-technical one with emulsion at a Michelin-starred restaurant. The vindaloo is one of the best you can have! I like extremely spicy food, but did well to follow the advice of owner Sandeep Sachar and ordered it with 6 chillis (on a scale of 1 to 10), otherwise I wouldn't have been able to savour the different subtle flavours in the curry. Fragrant biryani and excellent garlic naan. Warm and attentive service staff, who share Mr. Sachar's passion.",

Get the Malabar Fish curry here, but i'm sure most of the other dishes are delicious too!---- SET LUNCH ----Pappadum: 4.5 starsCrispy, light and addictive, and the three sauces all taste fresh and delightful.Tomato Coriander Soup: 4 starsHeavily spiced with coriander, parsley and perhaps pepper too but tastes light and slightly sweet, pleasant.Malabar Fish Curry: 5 starsThis is amazing. Might be the best curry I've had in my life, and I grew up in Singapore. Delicately tender fish fillet, I hate when people overcook fish in curries but this was perfection especially with the fresh grated coconut in the tangy santan curry. This is apparently a Kerala-style dish. Cannot recommend this highly enough!Okra: 4 starsSlightly bland spicy but they give you so many ingredients... tomato, cherry tomato, onion, ginger and the okra! Tastes very fresh and healthy.Yellow Dal: 4.5 starsGarlic Naan: 3.5 starsSuper fragrant, quite greasy and crispy but slightly bland tasting. I've had better naan, but even average naan is yummy!Set lunch is such a great deal, it was S$17 for all of the above! If you order a la carte the Malabar Fish alone would be $20 (for a bigger portion of course).",

    "text": "This joint brings you higher end (and higher price) Indian food than what you'd normally get.The lamb samosa was a large Punjabi style one, chock-full of minced meat. It was crispy and quite flaky.The chicken mulligatawny soup was both sour and salty. I'm not sure how to describe it but it had a pleasant taste. Then was Bharwan aatish khumbh - tandoori Mushrooms with nuts and cheese. It had a wonderful mix of flavours and a rich nutty taste. It was a bit sweet - which the manager had informed us about when we ordered. So it's not for everyone.We also had the murgh korma - chicken in a slightly sweet, mild rose cashew sauce. I was surprised by how mild it was. It seemingly had no chilli, and just a bit of pepper. I could even taste the rose. It was very pleasant and more subtle than Indian food usually is (though it'll probably be derided by purists). One thing to note is that a good cut of chicken was used, whereas lower end Indian places use cheaper cuts. This isn't necessarily a good thing, since the meat loses some moistness and flavour.To accompany our dishes we had butter roti and lachhna paratha (layered paratha). They were pretty good but they were not hot and the former did not have any palpable liquefied butter. In short, they were a bit old. I told the manager who claimed all the food was made only upon ordering. Well...We also had mango lassi which was excellent with a very intense mango taste.The service was not so good unfortunately. I asked for water and the server forgot. Only when I told the manager did it come. The mushrooms also only came upon my reminding the staff. Also the restaurant was a little bit warm.Overall this place is alright, but not very good value.",

This is a great bet if you're looking for traditional Indian. What really makes this place so great is the service. Everyone was so nice, and attentive. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Singapore and highly recommend.",

Staff are friendly and attentive.There is always some cheesy Bollywood movie or music video playing on the drop down screen in back, but it somehow adds a whimsical charm to the place.While we haven't really been blown away by the vegetarian offerings, like channa masala and dal lentils, the meat offerings are well cooked and nicely spiced. I highly recommend the lamb chops masala. Dishes are served with rich, velvety sauces. I suspect a lot of ghee goes into these offerings. As a result, the wife and I usually choose to walk home from Curry Culture to battle the inevitable food coma.",

    "text": "I was visiting Singapore on a conference trip and had craving for some Indian food. After reading lots of great reviews about this place, we decided to dine here on a Friday night. Getting reservation was easy as we were here an hour before it's closing time. We were seated promptly outside and the server was quick enough to take our orders. We had samosa and papdi chaat as our appetizers. The papdi chaat was better of the two.. very tasty with right amount of tanginess, spices and chilly! The samosa was also good but I enjoyed the chaat more. I often judge an Indian restaurant by the kind of chaats they make. I was in the mood of having some cocktail which will be spicy yet having the good liquor .. the waiter knew perfectly my want and served me the India summer- cocktail with whiskey and spices.. it was the perfect drink I needed on a Friday night. A must try drink if you enjoy some spices! The main course- aloo paratha, Channa masala, tandoori roti and aloo gobi was spot on.. very tasty, flavorful and true to its kind. Definitely fabulous dining experience. The service was excellent and a perfect ambience to have dinner with friends. Next time will love to try non- veg dishes as they seem to be excellent!",

Here the Waiter bent over backwards to accommodate hubby and we throughly enjoyed the curries!! Desert we ordered Kulfi ice cream, this should be melt in your mouth creaminess but it lacked essential flavor and had a gritty texture? But if it's curry your interested it's a nice spot off Orchard Rd amongst bright traditional shop houses were you can take in the atmosphere and relax",
