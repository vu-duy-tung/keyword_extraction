    "text": "Came during prine lunch time. There is the ability to order while standing in line if you know how. We ordered from our table using our phone: salmon, fatty salmon sashimi, tuna, eel sushi, crab and avocado roll, soft shell crab hand roll. We experienced one potential glitch and someone was there to help us immediately. Tables were equipped with big jars of ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Menu is beautiful and in 3 languages, photos of everything, and a corresponding number to order. Table equipped with a drawer that has the plates chop sticks and napkins in it.Now for the food: the Edamame was inconsistent, some perfect; some overdone.Miso could have clams soak longer. Crab not crunchy in hand roll.Sashimi was good.Place was crowded and service is friendly and efficient. This is located in a food court type area but is a full restaurant.",

    "text": "WORST EXPERIENCE! Restaurant was empty when we got there, and the staff told us that we had to download their app to order, or they would not give us a table. The staff was extremely unpleasant. Once we had finished our food, we read that there was a promotion in which they would give customers a free icecream for every 20$ spent. We ordered ours, and the waiter pulled such a face at us, that we almost felt bad to order it...they offer promotions to customers, but really they just want you to leave your table asap and hope you forget your icecream.They charge 1$ for icewater too. Not that its ilegal, but its surely something cheeky that only few restaurants do.Im surely never going back. I eliminated their app as I was walking out of the restaurant. I wouldn't recommend this place to absolutely no one.",

Oh did I mention that the tables are so close to each other it reminds one of being in the football stadium on match day? Have fun sitting next to a family with kids with zero upbringing . Good opportunity to check if your ear drums are tip top or not . Service? ... not even gonna touch on that.",

The roasted sushi are delectable and not commonly found in other sushi bars or restaurants. We arrived at 8.30pm, queued for 10 mins, ordered and waited 10mins for the first dish and 15 mins for the second and another 15 mins for the third etc. We ordered 8 dishes by the way so the wait was overbearing. Salad was served second last.We had to catch the waiters' attention to refill our tea. Two of our orders were sold out, the waiter dished out which orders were sold out and left our table before we could even have a chance to select something else. I did not even catch what he mentioned was sold out.They don't smile or anything. But well the food is good so perhaps visit only when you are not rushing anywhere.",

While ordering on the app is a little unconventional, the sushi was great! Most Westerners will be surprised by the lack of creative \"rolls\" on the menu, but there are really a lot of authentic options and more than a few fish I had never gotten to try before. The staff was nice, food was good. Great experience - highly recommend it!",

However, the waitress serving drinks could have come around more regularly to refill the green tea.Wallet wise - 2/5. Very expensive sushi rolls. The cheap ones such as the 60-70cents one were sold out by the time I had gotten a seat. I was standing in line for about 20-25min.Will be back again because of the good food, but probably not in the near future!",

    "text": "If the item is cheap and good, often, you will attract a huge crowd in Singapore. This is what happened when words get around that Itacho Sushi dishes out limited 40 cents sushi that are tastier than those on the sushi conveyor belts. Don't be 'mislead' by that item as it is the only item that cost 40 cents and depending on the time and branch, it tends to be sold out fairly quickly. In fact, my recent visit to Itacho I realized that have reduced the quantity of this item per customer from 4 to 2.They have a rather extensive menu for one to order from. \u00a0The sushi are delicious but often rather pricey. \u00a0Even if you are not a raw food lover, there are a lot of dishes for you to explore. You can even order from their lunch specials. \u00a0From time to time, you can order some of their seasonal catch and specialties.",

With sushi starting from just 40cents, and covering a large smattering of options that can leave even a seasoned sushi diner like myself confused, it's easy to go crazy and buy everything off the menu. Perennial favourites are the roasted scallop sushi and the grilled fatty salmon. Both are a must-have every time I visit and I never have just one! The rest of the food on offer are pretty decent as well, but I feel their sushi is what they excel in. The Bugis branch is probably the only place you get to enjoy the sales item that includes the 40cent salmon skin sushi, which I've never had the chance to eat elsewhere in their other branches.",

Everything else on their special menu is simply irresistable too - from the scallops to the duck. The Wagyu beef \u00a0is slightly expensive but definitely a must try. The avocado salad was yummy too.They also serve your fare of typical Japanese cuisine at a price which is competitive as compared to that of Sushi Tei. Good deals are sussed out by Singaporeans, so be prepared to queue for a seat at this popular establishment.",

The funny thing is they don't really need to do much else other than pick your order sheet up since they make you do the actual writing down of the order anyway. Too much work, I guess.

I think one of the reason make the queue unmovable is because the space is squeeze and only serve with limited seat compare to other store.When I have been here for first time, the order colour forms and the menu is my nightmare. At least 4 colour order form with different categories, I was spending at least half an hour to explore the menu and fill in the forms.Honestly the sushi here is a bit expensive like one bean curd sushi is one for one dollar. All the sushi here really value for money and fresh, unlike other revolving/kaiten sushi they only serve the dishes when you order and the food is serve without delay.",
