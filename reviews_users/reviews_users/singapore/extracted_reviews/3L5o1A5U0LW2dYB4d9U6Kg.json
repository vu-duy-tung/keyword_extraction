    "text": "Great place for various dark beers, meads, perhaps a shade too many IPAs, occasional knockouts like the Heretic porters. Best selection in town, most of it international. Great beer munchies made in a microwave. Who needs food, anyway... They have a loyalty card system, though won't honor cards older than a month... So don't forget one in your wallet like yours truly! \u00a0An excellent no nonsense place for beer lovers. Great for an evening pint or catch up. Wish they'd update their website regularly or have emailed alerts whenever they tap a new keg. Pretty much the only place I go to now for beers. Happy to see more outlets opening up. Great deal on growlers to fill and take home for parties too... Or to drink alone while you sob that they've run out of the Heretic Chocolate Stout!",

Wide selection of beers to choose from, and \u00a0at affordable prices!They're having a promotion for the whole of march; $10 for all beers, and house wines. Here for the food? Would recommend looking elsewhere; mostly finger food that have been microwaved. Go early cause it gets crowded",

    "text": "Ok, I haven't reviewed TAP because everybody else seems to have already. \u00a0I really don't feel like they need me to bolster their already soaring cred with my humble review, but anyway, here are my two mites...As mentioned in my other reviews, the craft beer scene in Singapore is at its most delicate and vulnerable, with hawkers of craft, tentatively putting out new shoots into the beer-naive firmament of Singapore's drink atmosphere. \u00a0 With more than a few customers genuinely inquiring what an India Pale Ale is, it is a gentle time for those venturing into the market to deliver craft beers to thirsty or curious Singaporeans. I have always given 5-star ratings to those who are brave enough to venture out into the harsh unforgiving and often times brutal arena that is F&B in Singapore armed with little more than a burning desire to bring you what they believe to be good to eat and drink. \u00a0They absolutely deserve all the feeble help my timid Yelp can give them!Ok, so TAP...lTAP is brought to you by the same folks that brought you Thirsty, the lovable \u00a0neighborhood bottle shop that carried a very good collection of American craft beers which when they first started ran afoul of my taste buds when I got a six pack of \"old\" Blue Moon. \u00a0The stock is certainly a lot fresher than it used to be and besides being a good thing in and of itself, is also a fair indicator of just how much more Singaporeans are interested in and therefore more willing to fork over serious money for craft beer. This is a fairly recent thing and a very good thing for food and drink in Singapore. \u00a0Sit at the bar at TAP, or visit Thirsty or The Great Beer Experiment or Druggist and you'll hear more than a fair share of requests for IPAs, something that I have some mixed feelings about. While I am happy that my fellow Singaporeans are exploring the wide and wondrous world of beer and venturing outside their comfort zones of the national-brand lagers like Heineken, Carlsberg, and Tiger, I am a concerned that the IPA is going the way of single origin beans in Singapore, being smothered by that miasma of hipness and being slowly and smugly co-opted as a symbol of sophistication by hipsters. \u00a0I suppose I really can't knock anything that keeps those kegs actively rotating, and the last thing anybody wants is a beer yenta sitting next to them at the bar...so I'll shut up and sip my beer.As mentioned before, the beers at TAP are disproportionately well-represented by American craft breweries like Stone, Modern Times, Lost Coast and occasionally Mike Hess. \u00a0This being Singapore, the key is to capture the attention of walk-ins as there are no \"regulars\" to speak of, customers that come back regularly for the same thing, so TAP keeps the lineup interesting and it keeps changing. \u00a0 At the time of this writing, they just hosted a UK takeover with some very decent ales, some of my personal favourites being the Pale Fire by Pressure Drop, Fourpure's IPA, Cali by Tiny Rebel, Bibble by Wild Beer, Pompelmocello by Siren and the very gravid, very ponderous Tsar Generation 4 by one of my all time favourite UK breweries, Buxton.As I think I mentioned in my review of NickelDime, it is a very nice coincidence that all these places that have ales on tap in Singapore are carving out their individual niches, so you can get some of the most highly rated beers from all over the world in a very small space. \u00a0Anytime you have that kind of varietal density, it's a good thing, a happy event, a righteous happenstance.",

Anytime I need a good IPA west coast IPA from tap...this is the place to go.Gentlemen, do take note that this place is also in the shopping areas in the city hall area, so man a great way to past the time on your next shopping trip with the lady. The food was only so so....but who cares!!!! You come here for beer and beer you will have!Had great conversation with the workers, not only super knowledgeable and true beerheads, they also knew a lot about the industry so some nice bar conversations..I will be making frequent trips to this place",

Cons: $sgd 14 beer during happy hour.Lack of attentiveness to customers; waited 10 minutes before finally giving in and asking for another beer. Not acceptable when there is four employees working and we are the only ones sitting at the bar. Staff was not knowledgable with the exception of maybe the owner. Singapore has many options when it comes to beer and this establishment just doesn't stand out.",

    "text": "Just moved to SG from the beer havens of Chico, California (home of Sierra Nevada) and the San Francisco Bay Area. I've found a few great craft beer places here so far, but none have matched the service we ultimately got at Tap last night (to be fair, I've not yet tried Smith Street, but it's on my list). The bartenders, especially Thomas, are laid-back but pretty attentive, full of expertise and great tips for beer choices, and happy to recommend local beer events, etc.I especially like that they cluster a handful of different beers from each of a handful of breweries rather than just a random assortment of single brews from all over the place; so, for Modern Times (San Diego), you can try their version of 4-5 different types of beer, from IPAs to stouts.Prices are high, but given the location, selection, and quality, that's a small price. Definitely going back, and I'd haunt them on the regular if I didn't live out near West Coast.",
