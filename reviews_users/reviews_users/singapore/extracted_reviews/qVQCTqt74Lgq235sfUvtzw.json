The meat patty is succulent and juicy, complete with fresh vegetables, cheese and burger bun! I enjoyed my food FRESH, and this did not disappoint!Food ordering is techy, head up to the tablets and tap what you need for the day! When your food is ready, number will flash and head over to collect it from the friendly service staff. There are classic burgers which you can choose from, or build your own burger! The sides are fantastic too! We ordered the onion rings which are crispy and oily. But well, there doesn't seem a way which they could drain the oil off the rings.TBB is a franchise co from Fatboys, by Singapore DJs, Vernon A and Justin Ang famously known duo as Muttons! I love how people open eateries with the concept of sharing the food they love.Definitely be back again as I'm a Fatboys fan too!!",

They cured that craving. It's set up kinda cool; you build your own burger on an iPad. They have pretty much all the typical toppings from what you would expect as well as some sauces I had never heard of. I went with the bacon cheese burger with truffle mayonnaise based upon comments I had seen on yelp. The size of the burger was good sized, probably a bit more than a 1/4 pound I had to help myself to some ketchup upon receiving my burger just because it wasn't an option offered on the iPad menu/ordering screen. The fries were also great! Certainly the taste of Americana I was looking for! Next time I'm in Singapore I'll certainly eat here. Another nice \"western\" touch was the 90s Brit-pop and American grunge music. Prompted me to loiter a bit \u00a0bit after I was done.",

    "text": "The Burger Bar by fatboy's concepts. I think they grew. From the reviews I was expecting a small, nook in the wall but it was much bigger and could seat way more than 12 patrons. Low ceilings and 3 high speed fans make sitting on the long bench a breeze. 4 more booths for a less communal affair. Simple, minimal frills but still well themed. Reminding me of a 50s diner. I can like that.The burger. Up for review, the bacon cheeseburger. Lovely, juicy and tender patty. Bacon and cheese blend well. I much prefer this beef to bun ratio. The juiciness of the beef will soften the bun but everything is well contained. Default is the burger by itself which is great if you're not that hungry. Or go with the assortment of side orders and appetisers. Enough said.\u00a0This guy cares about the product. No corners are cut with the condiments. Heinz ketchup, French's mustard. A corner to wash your hands and clean up after your meal. These lovely, small touches get a big plus from me.\u00a0Highly recommended to get your burger fix here.",

I recently had burgers in NYC at both the Black Tap Craft Burgers and the Burger Joint (in the Parker Meridian) and this burger was so much better than either of those. Based on reviews I tried the Truffle Fries. They were a little too much for me. \u00a0I think I would have preferred them plain since they were so perfectly crisp and did not need the extra frou frou. They also served Hoegarden draft in ice cold mugs which was greatly appreciated as I dealt with the sweltering humidity. If I am back in Singapore I will return!!!!",

This outlet is a pint sized version of your typical Fatboy's establishment, as there are only 12 seats available.They don't have any specialty burgers here; the concept is more build-your-own. The iPad ordering system is pretty straightforward and efficient. Even though Miguel and I ordered separately on two iPads, they were able to combine the orders seamlessly so we could pay one bill without any problems. Love!I ordered a cheeseburger on a brioche bun, no other extras- amazing! I thought the patty was dense and filling, and the brioche bun held everything perfectly even though the patty was very juicy. We also had an order of onion rings and I was amazed at how they were perfectly breaded and crispy.Unfortunately, the drinks from the cooler weren't cold that day (not sure if it's because they were just put there, or if something was wrong with the cooler) but we appreciated that the staff was upfront with us and let us know before we ordered. Other than that we were happy with our experience and wouldn't hesitate to come back again!",

Various options are included free of charge with extra add ons if you want to get fancy. I was really excited about my burger prospects when I placed my takeaway order and was drooling watching someone eat their burger and fries while I waited for mine to be done. When my turn arrived, my fries were drool worthy but my bun was completely soggy. Perhaps this wouldn't have been an issue if my burger had been eaten right away instead of needing to wait about 15 min to be enjoyed, I will try dining in next time. The only drawback there is that seating is very limited so if you go during a popular time finding a spot can be a challenge. Overall, my burger had good flavour, I will give them another go.",
