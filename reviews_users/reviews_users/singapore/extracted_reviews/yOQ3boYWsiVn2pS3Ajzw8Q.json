    "text": "Awesome Singaporean food. Our MBA group came here for lunch, and the food was delicious! Staff service was excellent as well, I'm surprised to see very little reviews on this place.Food: Delicious, and cooked very well! I can't remember all of them, and no! I did not have the time to take pictures, since everyone including me - ate all the food in a hurry. Green Truffle Dumpling: Never in my life have I seen green steamed dumplings! I live in Houston, and I like to think we are diverse in Asian food. But Singapore has got us beat! The dumpling was sticky, fat, and delicious! The mushroom was so aromatic as well. Fried Rice: Didn't try it, however everyone else gobbled it up!Shrimp paste wrapped in fried bean curd skin: Crispy outside, steamy inside! Black Crab Chili Buns: My goodness, I crave these little guys! They're absolutely stunning and in a way they look exciting. They look like pure black buns in a muffin/cupcake cup. When you bite into it, you get this sweet flavor from the bun with a hint of spiciness from the stringy crab. It was silky smooth, and delicious. This is their signature dish, and would recommend everyone trying it. I even tried to find online recipes, however I cannot! Mango pudding: Delicious, it was almost like a mango cream/milk jello, with mango bits inside of it. It was sweet, cool, and refreshing.Service: Very quick, most of the folks at my table were not familiar with the dishes and they came by to explain to them. I also asked for serving spoons, and they promptly gave them to us as well. These guys are excellent and super attentive.Come to this restaurant, you won't regret it!",

    "text": "Greatly underwhelming. Welcomed by two deeply non-motivated front staff with the older gentleman being borderline rude asking twice about reservations and making a great long scene looking for the (massively easy to spell, Japanese 4 word first-) name - when I pointed it out myself.We were 5 seated at a table for 10. We converged on one side of the table to get some conversation going.. must have looked kind of funny actually.The food: Soft shell crab: an oily sponge, please don't order.Chili crab: next to no crab meat, the worst sauce ever experienced in S'pore. Glutamate with some spices or colouring, it tasted so bland and awful we let nearly all of the dish go back. The buns we ordered were a disappointment, too.Tofu with mushrooms and greens: very niceBeef: actually the best dish (in a seafood restaurant)Waitstaff was very friendly and efficient but food and ambience subpar and way too expensive.",

My husband was looking forward to eating chili crab but was very disappointed. He said there was very little crab meat and the sauce was just not great. We also ordered asparagus and mushrooms which was also a disappointment. I also did not find the restaurant to be very clean and the service was lacking.",

    "text": "Strictly a review for dim sum.I was pleasantly surprised with how delicious the dim sum is at this place. I ordered the truffled mushroom dumplings, the chili crab bao, and their bbq honey pork in pastry. My favorite by far was the truffled mushroom dumplings, they are extraordinary. So delicate and full of flavor. \u00a0If you love mushrooms and truffles, you'll be pleased. The chili crab bao were just okay. \u00a0A bit under-salted, not as flavorful as I expected. \u00a0I wish they would pay more attention to how they make these. \u00a0I used them as a taste test to determine whether I would return to try their chili crab, after tasting these I think I'll pass. The bbq pork in pastry was really good. The best I've had so far. Huge chunks of meat and the bbq sauce was not overwhelming. It was perfect. Service was great, prompt and attentive. Note, they do charge you for the tea and wet napkin even if you don't touch it. But it's only $1.80 so whatever... I pick my battles.",

My biggest knock on SG so far with their crabs is that they just are not that meaty. You can all make the best chilli sauce or whatever but if your work your fingers to the bone for very little meat, we not have a good time. Room and table was nice after I requested we move from the cramped waiter station when the place was practically empty.",

    "text": "I was visiting Singapore for a few days and at the top of my list was the famous chilli crab that Singapore is known for. My research pointed me towards Jumbos, No Signboard and Long Beach. A few others popped up here and there, including Red House. I didn't think much of this one, but when the day I decided to venture out to get my chilli crab fix turned out to be a stormy day filled with rainstorms, I had to choose the easiest to get to. Red House was a mere two blocks from my hotel so that was an easy choice.At 1:30PM, the restaurant was still filled with families, tourists and businessmen having lunch. Dim sum was apparently still available as most of the tables were eating that. I noticed one table next to me with the crab - and only two people. That made me feel a little bit better, as I wouldn't be the only one making a mess of myself during lunch. Chilli crab, to say the least, can get a bit messy.I ordered the smallest crab available, which was still over 2 lbs. An order of mandou was standard as well. The staff brought out everything I would need to conquer my crab - claws, crackers, water with lemon, wet naps and a bib. When it came, I knew there was NO WAY I was going to finish it. It was HUGE. And then I had a taste of that slightly spicy, very sweet tomato sauce and had to sigh. It was easily the best taste of my entire trip. I did not intend on finishing it - I swear. But before I knew it, the entire crab was gone. The staff was surprised, I could tell. They were watching me eat through the entire meal, which was fine as my water bowl and teapot was constantly replenished. This meal was not cheap - my crab alone was $60 USD. But so, so worth it. It was the perfect meal to end a 11 day foodie adventure.",

Unlike my last experience at No Signboard which was ultra touristy to the max!Wok-fried and Tossed in Black Pepper \u9ed1\u80e1\u6912\u8783\u87f9 was just finger licking delicious! The sauce was really balance without over powering the freshness taste of the crab. The crab is meaty and full of roe at the same time.... Sambal Kang Kong \u53c1\u5c9c\u5e94\u83dc recommended by our friendly waiter was full of fresh from the wok taste. Just a touch of spiciness from the sambal sauce.As stated, crab and seafood is not cheap but just worth having at least once whenever I am in town. Hopefully, that will be soon!",

    "text": "So disclosure is that I didn't ask my husband how much the bill was bc I didn't \u00a0want it to affect my feelings about this place. The service is a bit gruff and reminds me of Chinatown restaurants in ny. Which is fine if the food makes up for it. And it totally does! Razor clams that are huge with some amazing garlic noodle topping. And the crab! I didn't care that I got it all over my rings and my elbow and hair and clothes and face. If I wasn't so full I'd drink that sauce straight up. Had one fried bun which was so soft and hot and yummy. But mostly just ate crab like a savage with my teeth. Using the crackers when necessary. Sweet and slightly spicy and messy and sticky and delicious. My favorite Singapore dining experience of the trip. My friends had some steamed fish and it looked nice but I had no room left to try. They chose the Sri Lankan crab and not sure why but so much sweet meat. Love chili crab!",

We had no trouble walking in and getting a table straight away. In fact it was near empty at 6.45 so I was wondering if I had made a bad call to pick this place. Service was excellent and the staff were very attentive to anticipate our needs. Menu is fairly extensive and the captain was knowledgeable in his recommendation. We decided to have white pepper crab and the baby squid with a stir fry of baby Kai Lan in mince garlic. Serving portions seem small but it was just right for two eventually as we didn't have much leftovers.",

The other highlight was a very drinkable bottle of white burgundy on special for S$65.
