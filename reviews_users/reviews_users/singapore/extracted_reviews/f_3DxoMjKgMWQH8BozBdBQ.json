    "text": "Looking for some casual yet amazing Indian food? This is the place. To start, you have to get the cauliflower manchurian appetizer, I have to resist licking the serving dish. Main courses I enjoy include lamb vindaloo, Tikka chicken, all the paneer dishes and your have to get a mango lassis to wash it all down with. I'm also a fan of the cheese naan, damn, it is tasty! Maybe not particularly a low calorie meal, but so worth it. Service is always friendly, waiter remembered us as soon as we walk in. Outdoor seating available to people watch or inside for some nice air con. I also like they always are playing bollywood numbers on their TVs, good stuff. Located on Racecourse Rd, maybe a 4 minute walk from Little India MRT. I like to eat dinner, then check out all the outdoor shops along the way.",

Everything was good, especially the lamb which was very tender. Final bill, including a beer, was $60, so not cheap but still worth it. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Having decided to have a few days stopover in SIngapore en route to India, I decided to get into the Indian food groove by visiting the main drag in the Indian district. Just a few blocks from the Little India MRT station, I noticed Aromas of India and checked out the menu, which was well laid out with a colored map showing the regional origin of the dishes. The restaurant is decorated simply, avoiding a bit of the overbearing decor in the neighboring establishments. Things started very well with exceptionally light and crispy spinach pakora, and progressed nicely with a really tasty gobi Manchurian. Rounded off with a creamy, spicy dum aloo and some wholewheat naan and a local Tiger beer, this was a genuinely exceptional meal with strong and distinctive flavors. Great friendly service and fair pricing makes this a restaurant to visit again!",
