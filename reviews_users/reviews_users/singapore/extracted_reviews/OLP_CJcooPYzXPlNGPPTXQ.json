    "text": "Currently going through a lot of Singapore withdrawals (I was in Singapore for 6 months in 2016) and what better way to relive my experiences than to write a review about one of my favorite places to go to for happy hour lol. Like many spots in CBD, The Black Swan is quite a fancy. Right when you walk in, it almost feels like you're walking in to a 5-star hotel especially with its elegant furniture, extravagant interior and semi-dimmed lighting. But when you go to the Powder Room, it feels like you just walk in to a ballin speakeasy. The room is pretty dark and has nice velvet couches, perfect for a more intimate setting.I've only come here for their Happy Hour menu and had their $2 oysters, truffle fries, calamari, and sliders. For the most part, I thought their bar food was quite decent especially for the price. The $2 oysters were always a huge hit in my book. Happy hour prices on wine and beer are pretty similar to most places but with its very sophisticated atmosphere, I feel like the happy hour drinks are more worth it here compared to other places in CBD. Place gets packed pretty fast so highly do recommend calling beforehand to make a reservation (especially if you want to be in the Powder Room). Service is pretty top notch as well. I've come here close to when HH was ending and the server still let me place my order and wasn't stingy about it. There was another time where one of the servers let me charge my phone by where the sound booth was.",

I had $12 French fries and it was one person portion.To be fair, this is where you enjoy atmosphere from the service and the decor rather than portion of of the food and drinks.

    "text": "The Black Swan is all about the 1920s sophistication. Think fine European classic dishes served in an equally classy and Art Deco building (The Quadrant) at Cecil Street. What i hear is that the bar is rather spectacular for an after work drink but don't miss out on their food! The Black Swan recently updated their menu and it now features classics such as Chicken Velout\u00e9, Steak Tartare, and Duck Leg Confit We hear that the Head Chef watches his team like a hawk to ensure the traditional preparation of these dishes are adhered to. Starting with the Raw Bar, the Black Swan Seafood Platter ($148) is a good starter to go with the selection of martinis and cocktails with its mix of Alaskan king crab, oysters, Maine lobster, Obsiblue prawns, Uni, and clam ceviche.If hot is more your thing, then pick some from the Small Plates selection. I highly recommend the Chicken Velout\u00e9 ($18), a comforting and luscious soup of poached chicken chunks, fried maitake mushroom, and Pain de aisses.The Steak Tartare ($26) uses coarsely chopped beef from USDA 365-day grain-fed cows and is served in a tangy bbq/ketchup and mustard marinate. This is more American than European i think but yummy nonetheless. Great with the toasted bread! Alaskan Snow Crab Salad ($24) features generous chunks of briny snow crab. This was a refreshing dish with the avocado, mango, orange, grapefruit, and citrus vinaigrette mix.Bigger plates will fill you up. If you're coming in a big group, i'd highly recommend that you make an 2 days advanced booking for the Roasted Suckling Pig ($148). Only baby \u00a0Spanish \u00a0pigs are used here and the tender meat is brined for 24 hours, marinated with herbs and then sous-vide for 6 to 8 hours before being roasted to crisp perfection. Love love love this and the tangy pickled vegetables that accompanies it.The Black Swan also has daily specials, which give you more reasons to come back every day of the week. Monday Special is the Tournedos Rossini ($50) which is a glorious 150g tenderloin topped with seared foie gras. Real truffle sauce with shaved truffles accompanies this decadent dish. We thought this dish tasted quite Asian due to the use of peppers as part of the bed of saut\u00e9ed vegetables. I wouldn't miss the Thursday Special, which is the Lobster Thermidor ($65). Yummiest whole Maine lobster, flesh removed and diced, then mixed with Mornay sauce, gruy\u00e8re cheese, and baked in the shell. Comes with fries too. Apparently you can switch it to truffle fries without extra charge. I may have been drunk by then so i can't be exactly sure if i heard it right. HAHA.Desserts are a must! The Black Swan Fireball ($22) is set ablaze tableside with Grand Marnier, the decadent chocolate sphere melts to reveal a tempting centre of vanilla ice cream sitting atop a tangy berries compote and crunchy chocolate pearls. Full of theatrics i must say but it was fun and tasty too.If you're for a more standard dessert, the Dark Chocolate Dome ($16) of Valrhona Guanaja, Vanilla cr\u00e8me, and seasonal berries would suffice.Back to drinks. Wine and Dine with with Bar Manager Gerardo Callipo, who will come around with his martini trolley. Cocktails are prepared tableside and we had more smoke and fire to round up the night. Don't miss the interesting The Black Cow cocktail which is a vodka made from milk. This is served with an English Cheddar cheese that is also produced from the same milk.Powder My Nose ($19) is a lady pleaser. Yummy mix of salted caramel vodka and apple juice, passion fruit and hints of mint. Sweet dreams are made of this!B.B.King ($19) is a spicy banana-infused whisky with smoked maple syrup, barbecue bitters and a little sorbet made from banana that has been soaked in the whisky! This was kinda spicy for me though. Coffee lovers would dig the Caf\u00e9 Royale ($19). I can't say no to espresso, especially when paired with a salted caramel vodka. The vanilla and cinnamon foam was turned into ice cream with the liquid nitrogen. Woot woot!The current Happy Hour Menu is available from 5-8pm on weekdays, with the offer of $21 for a glass of champagne and a pair of freshly-shucked oysters. Coming up in December, the Happy Hour Menu will be replaced with a $2 menu for oysters, and $11 for selected beer, wine and house-pours. More reasons to come back to The Black Swan!",

    "text": "We walked from 28 Hong Kong to the Black Swan last night for dinner. It's located in a building with a rounded wall entrance and is pretty easy to spot. It also had a roaring 20's vibe, similar to 28 Hong \u00a0Kong and it's servers were rocking dresses and pearls. The menu had a wide variety of options and would be great for a group of friends with diverse tastes. We started with the artichokes and bacon. It wasn't what I expected because the artichokes looked more like potatoes. The side is pretty hearty (pun intended) and is a good dish to share.I ordered the burger medium with no bun or cheese and cheated with the fries. It was cooked perfectly and ranks high on my list for burgers in Singapore, as I've found a good one hard to come by.Hubby ordered the pork chop and we split meals. Best of both worlds! It was prepared well--not to dry. The apple sides were delicious and the portion sizes were good.I was also very pleased with the service. Definitely worth checking out.",

    "text": "One a little bit of cocktail evening I decided to check out the Black Swan in the CBD. \u00a0It occupies a nice older rounded building close to Raffles Place MRT station so easy to reach. It has plenty of space inside and they have made a good job of creating a pleasant environment to have drinks in. Despite it being busy I was pleasantly surprised that we were promptly seated and handed menus and the staff also made sure to keep an eye on us and were there right when we were ready to order. The cocktail list was pretty interesting but perhaps a bit too much fruit and sweet to me but sampled the Good Night Good Luck and it was not at all bad and price level at 19 SGD is a bit lower than many other places. All in all good and I would not hesitate to visit again but it also failed to excite me.",

    "text": "We were originally headed for the Powder room, which is a separate lounge inside the Black Swan. It is run by the same owner, so the cocktail list is pretty much the same. Unfortunately we were misguided by false information on their website and the Powder room was not open on a Monday. So we went for the second best thing, the bar at the Black Swan itself. It is a pretty venue, so I didn't mind, as long as I got my cocktails. The Black Swan is located in a 1930's Art Deco space, the former home of the Kwangtung Provincial bank, so it is worth visiting just for the look of it.The drinks list is original, not your average Mojito but not as innovative as some of the other places I have reviewed (like Operation Dagger). I went for a Pie in the Sky with apple, rhubarb, orange bitters and some bubbly; and my date for the Salty Sea Dog with house spiced-rum, ginger syrup, orgeat, fresh pineapple juice and angostura bitters. Both drinks were good, but perhaps a bit uninspiring after the week of crazy innovative cocktails in the speakeasy scene of Singapore. The prices were not that bad though with 19 SGD being on the lower side of what we had paid for our drinks in the past week. A friend of ours who came to help with the sampling opted for a beer as he was not too fond of the sweet flavors clearly dominant on the drinks list. Fruity is not for everyone.You can also order food at the bar, and they seemed to have some Happy Hour oysters on promotion. We had just had dinner (and I don't really like oysters anyway), so we skipped the snacks this time, but in general I like having the option to eat something in between my cocktails. Perhaps next time I can try out the food menu.We were not that impressed, so we skipped the second round of drinks (and headed for Hong Kong 28). I am not saying the drinks were bad, but they were just plain boring in look and flavors compared to everything else we had had that week. In general the bar is nice, and I could imagine sitting there with colleagues after a long day at the office (if I worked in Singapore). This is definitely the place for groups as there is much more space than in many of the other cocktail spots in the city. However there are better places if you look at quality or creativeness of drinks, so depending on the company the Black Swan would perhaps not be my top choice.",

    "text": "So I found a splendid reason to visit The Black Swan - to celebrate my partner's birthday.Since it was a new place that was brimming with reviews left right center and since both of us have yet to try this swanky new place, we decided to give it a go.Service was beyond compare. I made a reservation on chope's website and as I wasn't sure if they had received my reservation I did the typically 'kiasu' Singaporean thing and texted the restaurant's direct reservation hotline. I also asked if they can prepare a surprise birthday cake for my partner. I got a reply call within 5 minutes of me sending the text which left me dumbfounded - the waitress was polite, accommodating and warm. What was great was that instead of replying with a text, they replied with a personalized call instead. Two thumbs up! Somehow, I wasn't able to find the place easily, coming out of the wrong end of Raffles Place MRT and I called the restaurant to ask for specific directions. I was given clear directions and my call was given a warm reception. Upon arrival, we were expected (I guess from my call) and was ushered to our seat. The waitress was knowledgeable and gave us excellent recommendations on food choices. We ordered starters of Crab Salad, The Black Swan Burger (for me), Duck Leg Confit (for him) and a glass of Silver Lining to share.Verdict:- Crab Salad ($21) - Generous servings of crab sprinkled amongst bits of avocado, mango and orange. The entire dish was doused in a sweet, zesty citrus vinaigrette which provides a lip-smacking finish.- The Black Swan Burger ($26) - A juicy, tender and thick beef patty checked all the boxes for me as a self-declared beef-tarian. Combined with melted cheddar, eggs, bacon and lettuce, it's all I want in a good burger. The fries on the side were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - just how fries should be.- Duck Leg Confit ($36) - Apparently this dish was cooked for 36 hours (or so it says on the menu description). Evidence of this can be seen where the soft duck meat literally falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. The addition of fresh thyme provides a refreshing, minty lift to the entire dish. From time to time, our waitress would check in with us and asked if we needed any thing. I thought this was a good touch but she wasn't intrusive at all. Some might not appreciate this service (especially in Singapore), but we liked it.At the end of the meal, my partner was given a surprise (to him) birthday Chocolate Lava Cake on the house. Prior to that, I told them I wanted to prepare a secret birthday surprise for him and given them his name. The result was lovely! Some of the servers came over and sang a birthday song, to his embarrassment.I guess the hubbub of the place was about how Gatsby-esque it was but to me it was incomparable to the food and service.Tip: If you are hoping for a really quiet, romantic dinner place, skip this place. It could get a tad noisy from 7pm - 8pm from the happy hour crowd seated at the nearby bar. The noise, however, died down from 8.30pm onwards.Otherwise, please do make a reservation and try out this place!",

But the hubbub was largely about the concept and the design, two things that were a complete letdown.The place is supposed to be modelled on Gatsby but I saw no Gatsby elements here. What primarily struck me was the aircraft hangar size of the establishment, the relatively impersonal service, the typical office-worker clientele and the total lack of character and heart. Also, the cocktails were pretty terrible.Just another place to drink after work, I guess. What a waste of a wonderful old building.",
