Perfect for the hungry hippo.The black soup comes recommended. Service is typical Singaporean nonsense.I lived in Tokyo for over a decade and am a purveyor of good ramen. 5 years ago there were only mediocre places. Now you have this, Ippudou and Tonkotsu King. I'd say the latter is one of the best.",

    "text": "3.5/5 Simple eats and okay variety. I think the ramen was alright. We were actually looking for another ramen restaurant but couldn't find it and this place was here so we decided to try it out. Their menu is pretty good with decent number choices of ramen. Pretty basic but I liked that you can choose your broth, white, black, red. (Original, garlic, spicy) and tsukemen you can even choose miso. We went it and ended up being toward the end of their lunch special. So I'd say a perk of this place is their lunch specials which is nice. You order on a iPad and that's about it. So I feel like the service charge is less worth it considering they weren't that attentive either. I got the lunch special kuro char siu ramen with the sushi. Sushi was lackluster and not worth it, rice was mushy and very petite. I think the broth should have been hotter and a little more flavor. Tip/ for normal noodle orders you can add more noodles (5 topups) for no extra charge Tip2/ check out their lunch special if you don't feel like a super large meal",

Three types of soup base: white (miso), black (soy sauce), and red (spicy). Each soup base come with two types of meat you can choose from: cha siu or pork belly. Very typical Ramen joint. There are also a small selection of appetizers and you can also order extra soup.The soup is thick and delicious and the portion is perfect. The price compared to the rest of singapore food prices, can be a little steep. Around $13 for a bowl of ramen, plus tax, plus service charge of 10% brings you up to almost $15. Their tea is only $1 and it's refillable. Cold or Hot.The best part is that despite it's authenticity, it was not salty, like normal authentic Japanese Ramen. I like that.I was quite happy.",

Yay!\"My second visit to this restaurant yesterday evening ended like this - \"Geez, the soup was so bland it was almost tasteless. What on earth happened? They ran out of salt?!\"We planned to have dinner at Marche's next door but decided that a rainy Monday evening calls for a piping hot bowl of ramen goodness - comfort food for my soul!At 830pm on a Monday evening, there wasn't any crowd as expected. We \u00a0were seated quickly, placed our orders in a jiffy and had our bowls of ramen brought to us all within 10 minutes. Speed of service - Not bad.I ordered the 'White\" Cha Shu Ramen and my partner ordered the \"Red\" Cha Shu Ramen. Upon tasting the soup, I requested for some chili oil or chili powder. Both arrived in good time and I added a sprinkle to my bowl. 5 spoonfuls in, I realised that their standard has really dipped to an all-time low. The springy-ness of the noodles which I loved on my last visit was missing, the Cha Shu was too salty, my Ajitsuke Tamago (Japanese Marinated Soft Boiled Egg) was cold and the soup was at best lukewarm.My partner's \"Red\" Cha Shu Ramen fared slightly better. At least his soup was more tasty compared to mine although his Aitsuke Tamago was cold as well. We are not fans of salty food but we both agreed that the \"White\" Cha Shu Ramen has seen better days. My guess was that they ran out of salt and that the usual cook was on his Annual Christmas Leave.Would I come back here again? Not in the near future. Give me Ippudo any time!",

    "text": "Trotted to Menya Musashi, I managed to beat the dinner crowd and witnessed warriors in their most remarkable swordsmanship. I owe it to Ms. Eunice Quek from The Straits Times where her review on the restaurant was published. How amazing that we are now so spoilt, luring so many well-known ramen stores from \"The Land of the Rising Sun\". Located in the civic district, almost down-town of our state land, the restaurant anchors on the first floor of Raffles City Shopping Mall. Since the complex is huge, one may experience difficulty in finding their way there. The restaurant is prominent by the main road. To be specific, if you are travelling along North Bridge Road, alight at the taxi stand and it is right in front of you, on the left hand side of the mall's main entrance. (Refer to the map below, it helps you navigate!)I am attracted to overall dark ambience with huge swordsman pictures and their open kitchen when I arrived. Most importantly, there has been no delays in acknowledging my presence at the entrance. Greeted by the staff, I got to my table briskly.The dinner started off with a plate of Gy\u014dza, the only side dish on the menu. The pot-stickers were marvellously chewy. The underside of the skin has been perfectly pan-fried, resulting in all those crispy bites! The meat and vegetables fillings remain moist and tender, they are smackingly good. 5s are never enough. The noodles are served within 15-20mins upon ordering (in the background, you could hear the chef yelling out loud as he pull the noodle when its cooked) , and it arrived at the right time when we are done with the Gy\u014dza. My take on Tsukemen? Here it goes: The most raved-about noodle appears uncluttered and glossy with pieces of chashu and leeks nicely arranged, topped with a half ni-tamago (egg). It taste al dente to me, some bite resistance but not leathery and are toughly cooked. It is not hard but firm. This is distinguishable from its \"wet cousins\", having noodles served in the soup. To ascertain my findings, I took a sip on the soup white chashu ramen. Indeed, the noodles from the white chashu ramen (soup-styled) are softer, less chewy. However, I prefer the former which I reckon it has to be so to dip into the bowl of thick broth. For the broth, Tsukemen dipping soup which comes separately, is more robust and thicker than the soup ramen's. It taste a bit more salty and goes perfectly well as you dip the noddle each time. The soup base for white chashu ramen is milder. At this point, I have already fall in love with Tsukemen even though it seems less popular, noticing only 2 out of each 10 diners ordered it.The evenly sliced chashu is tender and contains a good portion of fats. It has a good soy-sauce roasted flavour although it takes on a typical ramen accompaniment. But Menya Musashi does not ace in all aspect yet, for once, I find that the ni-tamago (soft-boiled egg) has been done poorly. It didn't match my expectation, a good ni-tamago should comes with a squishy white and runny yolk. However, Menya Musashi has a dry yolk and not oozy. It is very unfortunate but the noodles and broth still make the cut. To make your ramen eating more enjoyable, you will need to finish up quick enough. I experienced lumpy strands in my bowl while a thin layer of film has formed in my broth. I chose to believe that it was the collagen in that soup that are causing the film anyway. More evidently, I would think the air-conditioning is the main culprit.",

    "text": "I've had my good share of Ramen in the past, and Menya Musashi in Raffles City is pretty good, but not entirely memorable. I would recommend it if you are in the area and craving ramen like I was! Craving fulfilled! I came here with my brother and we ordered and shared the: Black Mori Ramen (S$17.90) Curry Ramen ($14.90) + Octopus ($3.00)Tiger Beer ($6.90)Total after Service Charge & Taxes: $50.25 (Not too bad!) We came early (before noon) and luckily the restaurant was fairly empty, so we were served rather quickly and got our meals within 15 minutes. The Black Mori Ramen was definitely interesting and had strong, but not too overpowering flavours. The meat was a little too fatty for me that I gave most of it to my brother to eat. The Curry Ramen was rather good as well, but not mouthwatering like some other famous Ramen places I have eaten at. However, I would choose the Black Mori over the Curry because the curry was a bit too heavy.The Octopus wasn't anything special, so I would spend the $3.00 on something else such as the eggs or more pork cha siew. This place became PACKED later in the afternoon and in the evening, so come early too avoid the crowd! I would possibly come here again to slurp a different bowl of ramen, and have an enjoyable walk around the not so crowded Raffle City's Mall.",

The soup was also a gooey mess that didn't taste of anything.If the service wasn't so hopeless I may not care as much.

Along with two other friends, we joined the dinner queue and ordered while at the queue. We were seated and served our bowls of ramen rather quickly. Each of us ordered a different type of soupy ramen, red, black and white, instead of the tsukemen. I had the red spicy ramen which was a spicy rich soup that was intensely rich in flavour. The ramen noodles were cooked well, and I liked that there was a choice of meat between the leaner pork belly and fattier rolled pork loin. The soup was a little too rich and I have definitely had better ramen broths for about the same price.I would definitely go back again to try the tsukemen ramen or if I was craving ramen when I'm at Raffles City but I will probably not make a trip down specially for their ramen.",

    "text": "I have always craved for Tsukemen, and when Menya opened I was hoping that this will be The One. While I was tempted to push to limit and go 5 times noodle, I refrained from the gluttony and just did 2 times, since I was rather hungry when I walked in. There wasn't a queue but it was decently packed with people. They do offer ramen, but it made little sense to me to even think about that with Tsukemen calling out to me. I ordered and it came, and I was in heaven dipping my first batch and sliding it into my mouth. The broth is think enough, savoury and thankfully not too gelatinous. Everything was great even though I usually prefer the hot noodle variation, which is not offered here. The thick meaty broth was as apparent as the nice bonito base, not too oily just the right balance. The only gripe I had was the end, where I had hope to slurp up my broth like a soup. Hot water from a flask was poured into my soup bowl and though it was still tasty, I would have rather had hot soup rather than hot water. Still, no complains since I got my craving satisfied and it is fairly priced.",

    "text": "Menya Musashi is located in a unit near one of the numerous entrances that Raffles City Shopping Center has. Opening to great fan fare due to its enormous reputation in Japan, the restaurant has quickly established itself as one of the go to places to go for ramen. Decor wise, Menya Musashi is nothing exceptional. A slightly stale smell lingers in the air - though if we are being honest here, most ramen shops have the same smell too, in varying degrees. The ramen here though is absolutely delicious. I tried the Black Tsukemen dish - side note: the restaurant gives you the option of \"upsizing\" the noodle size by up to 5x! This dish comes with a mountain of ramen noodles, and a small bowl of dipping sauce by the side. A refreshing change from the usual soupy ramen you get in most shops in Singapore. The dipping sauce was flavourful and toothsome - it was easily the highlight of the dish. Super yummy, and I can safely say that Menya Musashi well deserves its reputation for serving awesome ramen.",
