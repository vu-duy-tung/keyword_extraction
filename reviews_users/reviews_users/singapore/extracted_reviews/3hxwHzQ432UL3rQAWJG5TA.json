    "text": "Searching for Ramen Santouka is almost like a treasure hunt in The Central - attempt to reach it from another location in the mall other than the escalator near it, and you'd almost always lose your way. Though, upon finding it, the journey almost seems inconsequential as you peel back the curtains to reveal the treasure within. Springy, handmade noodles served in a thick, flavourful broth topped with tantalizing slices of cha shu (roasted pork) await the curious adventurer, and delving into the tantalizing layers of each mouthful reward the palate like no other. Few ramen places can compare when it comes to the combination of both affordability and taste.",

Typically, most people like the soupy ramen but i prefer dipping ramen. \u00a0The noodles are thicker compared to the ones for the ramen. It comes with a thick broth that tends to be too salty to drink but you can dilute its saltiness with tea and drink it as a soup. Oh yes. Don't forget to pair the ramen with a plate of their pork cheek slices. For dipping ramen, there are very few places that serve that in singapore so whenever i am in mood for dipping ramen, Ramen Santouka is the place I will go.",

It's very pricey if you go for the top end pork, however, and it does feel kind of strange to pay 30$ for what's supposed to be a homey low class dish. There's usually huge lines here if you go at the wrong times, but turnaround is usually pretty fast.",

    "text": "Overall I was really impressed with this place. Based on others reviews I ordered the ramen (shoyu) with pork cheek and a side of the soft boiled egg tamago thing. The service was super quick - but should be since all the ingredients are already cooked. The ramen broth was very substantial, more like a soup than a broth. Taste was excellent, and I'm sure a lot of that great flavor comes from the oils floating in the broth. This is one of those dishes that if you don't finish it (you should finish it though, it's really good) and put it in the refrigerator it'd probably have a healthy layer of fat congealed on the top the next day. Also known as Good Flavor. The pork cheeks, contrary to everyone's comments, does not actually melt in your mouth. There is a little chewing required, albeit not as much as, say, a pork chop of the same size. The cheeks are really flavorful. Fat, pork and salt, how can you go wrong? Everyone loves bacon. \u00a0Either you love it or you don't know you love it. \u00a0But you do love it... This is bacon for kings. I would eat the cheeks off these pigs any day. The egg was also good (for a hard boiled egg). I liked the creamy center. The marinade used to flavor the egg is very subtle and not overpowering. \u00a0I love them, I should have ordered another. This place is kind of difficult to find - at least it was for me. But if you are stubborn (like me) and have ramen on the brain (like me) you'll get there. \u00a0I had to walk through a different restaurant just to get there. \u00a0And then on my way out I felt sorry for all the fools eating at that other restaurant. \u00a0They should've gotten ramen.",

    "text": "Our favorite ramen place in Singapore has got to be Santouka. S declared this the best ramen in Singapore even before we tried several other popular ones like Marutama and Ippudo. The verdict still stands though. The Santouka brand, which was started in 1988 in Asahikawa, produces the best Hokkaido ramen on our little island. Despite the secluded and hidden corner in Central Clarke Quay, the queue gets pretty crazy during meal times due to the small capacity (it's about a 25seater) and insane popularity. I think it has only gotten better with the opening of a second outlet at Cuppage Terrace. If it's your first time to Santouka, i highly recommend the Tokusen Toroniku Ramen (S$19.50 for shio/shoyu/miso, S$20.50 for Spicy Miso). For that price, you would get a dish of roasted pork cheek and a bowl of springy and curly yellow noodles. Sides sold separately. The jowl meat is the most precious and delicious part of the piggy. It's only about 200-300g per pig (duh, they only have 2 cheeks!) Very richly flavored and tender! This texture has been likened to fatty tuna. I would say the meat is more firm (this is pork not fish you know).Best ramen still. Ippudo doesn't come close.",

And I've been there multiple times, in peak periods yes and no, and they were all great gastronomic experiences. Look at the picture of the pork cheek I've taken. I call it angel's wings for a reason. The texture's so soft and feathery, it melts in your mouth, instantly warming you up from the inside and taking you to the heavens. The taste of the meat is distinct, the moment you eat it, it's there in you for life. The soup's thick and heartwarming, the flavours are well-mixed and the noodles have a springy consistency that keeps you going after many spoonfuls.The eggs are another level of genius. You HAVE TO buy the extra eggs to try.There's free plain water that comes in a JUG for you (woots!) and if you can, get the seats that overlook the Singapore River. In this way you can check out the great night view outside and also turn to your left to revel in the open kitchen - the mastery of the chefs. If I've got one complaint, it's that too many know about this place and I wish the queues weren't so long every time.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews.",

Space is a scarcity so expect long queues should you visit at peak timings. Service is brisk, efficient and straight to the point. And having had the chance to dine at Ramen Santouka in Harajuku when I was on a holiday, I can attest that the service levels and taste are all exactly the same. One must-have dish is their speciality 'toroniku' or pork cheeks ramen. The pork cheeks come on a separate plate with condiments from the ramen (available in 3 different soup bases - shio, shoyu, miso) so you have the choice of pouring everything in or dipping them in one by one. (i recommend dipping - it just tastes better!) Having tried most of the other ramen joints that have sprouted up recently, I can safely say that no one else comes as close as Ramen Santoukawhen it comes to taste, service and quality of the food served!",

As usual, I was presented with a great bowl of ramen with really thick and savoury soup. However, there's one thing that I would like to say: the quality of the ramen isn't that consistent; sometimes the noodles would taste somewhat \"alkaline\", and other times the soup was not as savoury as usual. But suffice to say that when your luck is good, you'll be eating one of the best bowls of ramen in Singapore.

I was quite impressed because the soup is very flavorful! The only downside is probably that the char siew / pork was extremely tough. We expected a more tender meat but... I was left un-glamorously gnawing at my meat.Anyway, my boyfriend has a huge appetite and we were both quite hungry, but the Large ramen was too much for him, and the Medium was wayyy too much for me :( We couldn't finish the noodles!! I would say the large is good for sharing?We also had a BBQ pork bun each ($3), and it was really really yummy. It kinda looks like the Chinese kung ba pao! It's also served with a mini-sized cup of tea, which tastes like a normal Chinese tea. Please go to my blog to see photos!! I don't quite know how to describe it.Overall it was a good experience :) the ramen is really good but I wouldn't say it's the best in Singapore!! If you're bored you can check out my blog (on my profile) to find out my favorite ramen place ;)If we're in the area we'll definitely come back when we have a ramen craving :) it's delicious and quite worth the price!

Tried shio and shoyu broth and I prefer the shio because its cleaner tasting and is less salty vis-a-vis the shoyu. The portions they give for the noodles are huge! I was starving and yet couldn't finish.Only reason why this place didn't get a 5-star from me was cos its slightly on the pricey side and there was a long queue (so if you're starving think twice about eating here)",

The fat's not even oily at all, and spitting/cutting out the fat would just be a waste of all that lusciousness And as for the rest of the bowl, no complaints.

Best part of the set is that it comes with a side of pork cheeks (super good. specially imported from the US. it literally melts in your mouth) 2. Chicken gyoza- LOVE! although I've tried the pork one and think it's better. - nicely pan-fried. comes out with a think slightly crispy skin. super succulent and juicy inside (careful when you bite it! it's hot).",

Fortunately, this place is one of the few that I would have no hesitation in queuing for. The dozen or so times I have visited on a weekday evening there is a long queue, thankfully the table turnover is high, so the wait is never more than 15 minutes. I am a ramen lover, and for a decent bowl outside of Japan, this place is my normal go-to when those cravings become unbearable. \u00a0Being a Shio Ramen fan, I'll be honest in having no idea what the other items are like. Though saying that, the pork cheek!! Wow!! Such a deep rich complexity combined with a soft tender texture. \u00a0If you dine here you must must must try it! Service is almost invisible during busy times, though a great tasting bowl of ramen and pork cheek makes up for those short fallings. Jump in the queue and you won't be disappointed.",

Despite the crowd, service was good as the staff were efficient without being brusque. This really is a get in, eat, get out sort of dinner though so if you're looking for a more relaxed pace, you're better off elsewhere. It really is all about the ramen at Santouka. While Santouka really does serve up a good bowl of ramen, I do think there are better ramen places out there. I've learnt, though, that ramen preferences can be very subjective. So while I found the ramen a bit too chewy on the chewy-springy spectrum, some of my other friends loved it. And while I thought the broth (the Shio broth) was super tasty, some of my other friends thought it was a bit too rich and salty.But we all did agree that the egg was tasty, though the yolk a bit too gelatinous. And the pork cheek was fantastic and and just the right proportion of fat. The portion is quite large though. So if you're ordering the pork cheek ramen, I would recommend ordering the smaller portion if you don't have a huge appetite.",

Its depth of flavor really sets this place apart from other places.The sitch: I suspect I reaaalllyyy enjoyed this lunch because the place was empty (super late lunch) and the servers were still so super friendly and attentive throughout. I imagine the eating experience would be very different at peak hours when you are basically sitting on top of the person next to you.

I left decently full but found the shoyu ramen to be too salty. Also, the salty and fatty pork cheek added to the saltiness. The atmosphere was nice because you can look out onto the river. The only issue was the waiter consistently kept trying to upsell add-ons to the ramen and dishes to multiple tables around. It was annoying the upsell table by table and then the customers would just say no question after question. They should know when to stop asking in my opinion or just not be so aggressive with the upsell. Which is why I decreased my review from a 3 to 2 stars. Not the best ramen and for the price I could try another place rather than returning. I'll have to update this review when I try other ramen in Singapore.

    "text": "Located in the purple zone and also a corner of Central is Ramen Santouka. This was their first outlet in Singapore. Their second outlet resides in Cuppage Plaza in Orchard Road. Santouka's founder Hitoshi Hatanaka opened his own ramen shop at Hokkaido in 1988 because he was unsatisfied with all other ramen establishments. Its thin-noodle ramen with elegant broth topped perfectly with mouthwatering slices of char-siu pork and pickled plums gained popularity in Hokkaido immediately. Now in 2015, there's outlets of Ramen Santouka all across the globe and my friends even mentioned the outlet in LA, tasted better than the outlet in Singapore!Looking through the menu you realize that you get to pick your soup base. Be it, Shoyu (soy sauce flavour), Miso (soybean) , Shio (Salt flavour), or Kara-Miso (spicy soybean at $1 more). The dining area of Ramen Santouka is a rather elongated one, that stretches into the kitchen. The chef is able to see every customer who walks in and walks out. And for every customer that walks out, the chef will say thank you for patronizing them. It is very typical of Japanese ramen shops in Japan to be small and compact, so that the chefs are also able to witness the customer's experience with their ramen.Miso Ramen (Medium ) $13.50+I went with my lone favourite Miso. I admit, the bowl looked small, but it was deep. After my first few dips with my chopstick, I realized I was looking at the chance of skipping Beard Papa for desserts later! The broth itself was thick and you could see a thin layer of oil swimming on the top. It wasn't too gerlat, as much I managed to drink quite a bit of the soup. The noodles are the winner here. They are extremely springy. Similar to that of maggie noodles and yet without the waxy exterior that instant noodles give you. The texture of the noodles were consistent throughout the entire serving. \u00a0The bambo shoots here were also crunchy and since they absorbed all the flavour from the soup, they sure were tasty!The two glorious slices of char siew weren't fatty at all. Instead they were tender pieces of juicy meat, that again, absorbed all the goodness from the soup.I enjoyed my bowl of ramen as it didn't have me craving for water like the ramen from other competitors which are ladden with MSG leave me.",

It was great... broth and noodles where perfect and I ate everything.I'm giving it a 4 star because of the price point... I think it was on the expensive side and ramen isn't expensive. Also it took me awhile to find the location as it's hidden.If you're in the central or clarke quay and looking for ramen come back here.I'm a fan!",

Never one to waste. My friend had the normal miso soup base, apparently it taste just as good. The gyoza is surprisingly moist inside and the skin is very thin. I think they got the balance right.The service is prompt and attentive. Too bad they only allow downsizing of the noodles but no upsizing. I love good noodles so its a bit disappointing.The afternoon sunny view of the river is a bonus. I bet it looks better at night with all the Clarke Quay neon!",

While other broth pales in comparison, or stinks of pork bones that I seriously considered conversion of my religion, santouka has a delicious soup base.Strangely enough, I could do without the pork cheeks. I am just contented with the soup.It's nice and rainy now. coming to this page is agony to my tummy :(",

I guarantee you will not be disappointed. With so many options and only 1 stomach, I had to make very smart and wise decisions. Every food choice is strategic. It has to be the best if not why bother. There are tons of ramen places in San Francisco Bay Area. However, I always tell my friends nothing beats the options and quality available in Singapore. Outside Japan, I think Singapore is probably the only country with the most ramen shops per square mile. There is fierce competition. I researched and read reviews, strategically planning which ramen shop to go to. Santouka was my final pick! Oh boy!! I was blown away. The egg was perfectly cooked. Nicely set egg white and gooey, soft egg yolk. The shio broth was flavorful and not overly greasy. You can pretty much drink up all the broth and not feel coagulated fat swimming in your stomach. The noodle texture was great and it did soak up some of the flavor from the broth. The pork jowl ... OMG ... and OMG one more time!! one bite and I felt my life is now compete! Well seasoned and cooked perfectly. It tasted better than the pork jowl I had at Lazy Bear recently. I've been to Japan numerous times, ate many bowls of ramen. I must say I'm in love with Santouka ramen.",

I also like how the noodles are chewy. I also recommend getting the spicy soup if you want a kick for the broth. For the rest who prefer a combination of rice and noodles, definitely order their set meals which serve up a generous half portion of ramen and a half portion of rice. Highly recommended!",
