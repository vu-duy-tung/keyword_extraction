It's right next to the river boat tours so you can watch people, and watch boats coming in and out.I did stick around a bit longer and went for their big sampler and fried rice. It's basically everything on their menu all on one plate. All good stuff and they give a lot of food.It's still hot even under their covered outdoor seating, but at least some of their fans still work.",

We got the platter filled w/ fried delicacy that were mediocre at best however, the fried chicken wings and egg rolls were good. + chicken wings had a crispy exterior and juicy insides+ egg rolls were fried perfectly A rather extensive menu and prices weren't too bad considering this is a major tourist area. Service was great, the food came out pretty fast, and I sincerely wish they reconsider the water offerings. They looked at me weird for wanting iced water.",

And my half priced drink came in a half filled glass. Appetizers were boring at best. The light fresh spring rolls were the best but the sugar prawn was made of cheap pur\u00e9ed something that may or may not have been prawns and the chili crab dip was just a bowl of liquid with little actual crab. The disappointment if the night was the much vaunted lemongrass beef tenderloin which was just a bunch of dry tasteless beef. No lemongrass we could discern and completely void of any redeeming value. Save your money and have a great meal at any of the hundreds of places in the streets behind Boat Quay.",

There is an indoor area which is open to the walking path, basically opened wide doors, and a nice verdana on the water-side. The decor is fetching with dark, blue tones with a sprinkling of Vietnamese-ness.As for the food, I recommend STAY AWAY from all soups and noodles. How you churn out mediocre pho and bun bo hue is beyond me. All else is 4/5 stars - fried rice, spring rolls, and other appetizers. Although good food, as I said it's on the pricey side.BOTTOM LINE - go for the ambiance of Clarke Quay, the food is OK but do not expect top-shelf Vietnamese fare. I've eaten better on the streets of Saigon.",
