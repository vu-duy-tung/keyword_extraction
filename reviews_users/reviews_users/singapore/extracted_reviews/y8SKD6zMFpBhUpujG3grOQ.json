    "text": "This reliable restaurant recently renovated, revamped the menu, and increased prices. All is well, as the food is still good and some of the new items are interesting (lots of charcoaled dishes, like tofu or youtiao), although certain additions are not great (eg. cheese prawns). However, for some reason, service has become quite chaotic. Items take forever to come out of the kitchen, mixing up of orders, etc.",

    "text": "Gosh it feels like Crystal Jade has been here for ages now. Remembered having beef brisket noodles here when they first opened perhaps almost 20 years ago? I think it's still pretty decent. Had dim sum breakfast here and enjoyed the food. In particular I enjoyed the crispy carrot cake, siu mai, deep fried stuff tofu skin, and the liu sha bow. Their take on a Teochew rice cake was interesting - took a little while to get used to the sweet and savory. Service is adequate but terse to say the least. Guess that's what happens when you've been around for a while. Air-conditioned second floor opens at 11am but you can get seated in the open air section before that. All up, Crystal jade in HV is still a dependable spot to grab a meal if service with a smile is not a requirement.",

Expect uninspiring Cantonese food, but a far cry from what you get in Hong Kong.I had the stir-fried Chinese spinach with minced garlic, the shrimp dumpling noodle and pork and chives dim sum. Nothing notable either way about the spinach. The dim sum tasted like it was just thawed, the skin was sticky and soggy, and did not tightly wrap the filling. The noodles weren't great either, it lacked a the springy bite one expects from Cantonese style noodles, while the soup base was very bland and one-dimensional.",

    "text": "I don't usually eat at Crystal Jade but this outlet is in a Holland Village and therefore is quite convenient for someone who lives in the area. The restaurant reminds me of the cha chang teng's in Hong Kong with quick service, noodles & congee and of course, dim sum. Note that this restaurant is different from Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao, which I believe a prior reviewer has reviewed here.Crystal Jade to me is all about char siew wonton noodles and dim sum. They do a pretty mean Hong Kong-style char siew noodles, with just the right amount of \"al dente\" that mee kia should have when topped with some thick sauce and a generous serving of roast port and kai lan. The dim sum is hit or miss. I like the char siew soh (roast pork in a very, very delicious and flaky pastry) and egg tarts. The siew mai and friend prawn dumplings are ok. I do love the pei dan chok (century egg porridge) because it is done the right way, stirred until the rice breaks to form a smooth congee.Prices here will not break the bank and the auntie servers are quick.I would say try to come after peak meal hours as you can end up waiting quite a bit for seats. The auntie we had today was really knowledgeable about the menu, very courteous and very intuitive. She topped up our water without us asking and offered a pair of serving chopsticks when our spinach with eggs arrived, saving us the mess that would have happened if clumsy old me tried to ladle spinach in broth. Kudos to Crystal Jade for hiring older folk - they look like they like their jobs and the restaurant seems to run well.",

    "text": "This branch of Crystal Jade seems to be the only one that offers Xiao Long Bao buffet style. If you've been living under a rock so far, Xiao Long Bao's are little soup dumplings with pork meat and various seasonings. But the main feature that made this dumpling famous and popular is how the thick broth soup explodes in your mouth after that first bite. We would have visited this branch a lot more often if we could, but the sad fact is their location does not fit many table and seats, so 50% of the time, our reservation would be rejected. They have several timing slots for each buffet session, each lasting 2.5 to 3 hours, so its best to give them a call to make the reservation way before the actual date, especially on weekends! Seating is usually brisk since all patrons are already allocated with a queue number. You get to order your preferred items from a list and can continuously order throughout the meal until about 20 minutes before the end of the session. Food is good and ingredients are quite fresh, but of course, remember to get their XLBs! It's a safe bet to order 20 and go from there for 2 people!",

    "text": "We came here for dinner and are glad we did, though I would recommend arriving early. We came around 9pm and half of the dim sum menu was sold out. We had BBQ pork bao, pork and chive fried spring rolls, broccoli with oyster sauce and garlic, duck congee, and steamed shrimp dumpings. The food was delicious and with generous sized portions, we left feeling absolutely stuffed. The bao and spring rolls tied for my favourite dish of the evening- the bao was moist, the spring roll was crispy, and they were both bursting with flavour. Our bill for everything came to S$40 which makes a return visit on the agenda.Service was a bit chaotic though very friendly and eager to serve. You had to flag someone down anytime you needed anything but they were always polite and the food came out together and hot which can sometimes be a struggle when a restaurant is busy. I would recommend this restaurant to friends and will definitely be back again to try more dishes.",

The brisket what there was was nice. However the serve was small and the service a little grumpy. A smile will not kill you or I would have murdered thousands. The bits of beef were tender and tasty however I am not keen on eating 4 lumps of fat with no meat. So I had two nice bits of beef. The soup was bellow average. The vegies nice. Noddles perfectly done and once a again a very small serve. I had the dry version. I have walked by this place many times and was very curious. I finished work early and thought I would treat myself. Turns out it was nothing special and I recommend a meal at the hawkers across the road for a better value and more smiles.",
