Many people will drop by either to dine in or take out.Being a half Teochew, I will say the fare is common in my home and maybe that is why growing up, we usually do not dine out at Teochew porridge place. This is probably the 3rd or 4th time in my life that I have actually ate in such a place. I would say it is good wholesome food which is very familiar to home. So if you or your family hardly cook, then this place is a Godsend. But if you get such food at home all the time, it is not impressive, and you definitely will think twice about spending $20 for 2 persons for a plate of fish, mei cai kou rou, 2 meat fishballs, cold tofu, braised tofu and hard boiled eggs.",

As I walked up to order, the authentic experience kicked in: the uncle spoke to me in Teochew, and I had no idea what was going on. I gingerly started in my stuttering Chinese, with the occasional Hokkien (I know, wrong dialect, but that's as close as I can get), and then the girlfriend came to the rescue; she of Teochew origins (on her mother's side), with the brave and direct pointing and nodding. If only I'd known...To be honest, the selection didn't look so hot, and maybe it was the unfamiliarity, or maybe it was just full of stuff that I didn't eat - I'm not Teochew at all, so this is my usual palate/cuisine.In any case, we over-ordered the pre-requisite amount that we do, and while the food was all tasty, I couldn't help but have a longing for my Beo - and I felt like I was cheating on my food! Horrible feeling, let me tell you, but it was what it was.Glad to say I've tried this one, but my heart belongs to another.",

    "text": "First and foremost, this is my first review here and a little background is I came here with a craving for Teochew porridge. So once here, the food here i find in terms of portion for 2 is lesser than say if we had in Bukit timah Teochew porridge. But this doesn't really concern is as we can order more dishes, saw someone order the \"Chang\" before us while in q and we decided to order also. So the person reccomened \"da Chang\" and we realize that we don't like the taste of it. As for the rest of the food we find it slightly above average. (Remember we were hungry in the first place) one thing to note is that the drinks stall sells \"Cheng ting\" in a cup and some other Chinese drinks. Which is a plus point for me. All in all, we ordered: bittergoud, fish (Chang Yu), lala, and the \"da Chang\" is 19.50 with two porridge and a rice. Realize that the portion is small I added a fried beancurb and a porridge which is 1.50. So total is 21 dollars. (Will attach some photos if I can. :)",

I can't say this enough but I think this passion was probably cultivated from years of sitting around the dining table, with a whole spread of dishes before me - my chopsticks hovering mid-air, uncertain what to to add to my steaming hot bowl of porridge.My family shifts their loyalty every few years from one Teochew porridge stall to another for some strange reason that I am not let in on. And for the past two years, it's been Ah Seah. It's quite hard to review the the dishes at this stall because there are just too many of them. Expect the usual fare of fresh steamed fish, duck simmered in dark sauce and soft cabbage stew - they do it quite like how a grandmother would make them, and that's a thumbs up. Bring a whole group along, that's the best (and possibly the only) way to get the most out of having Teochew porridge.",
