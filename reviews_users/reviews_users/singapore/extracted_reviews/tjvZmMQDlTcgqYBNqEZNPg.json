    "text": "While waiting for my friend to be done with work, decided to come here as her office was located opposite this store.Came here the second time before writing in this review. The first time I came, I had savory bread - Bacon Focaccia. It looked good on the display section and it was even better after they used the oven to heat it up. It was also filling and I just had one piece of that for dinner. When I was about to leave, I bought the lemon meringue. It wasn't as good as I thought it will be as I consumed it hours later. The second time I came, I had the Raspberry Croissant. The server also heat it up before serving. I asked for a to go bag (brown bag) so that I am able to taste the croissant in bites instead of using fork and knife. The raspberry filling was so amazing. On top of the croissant there were powdered sugar and almond which made it sweet and crunchy. The texture of the flakes was just done perfectly. Service was excellent. The servers will repeat the order of what you are getting one more time for accuracy. They also greet you upon entering this cafe. Every time I come here, people also started to rush inside here to buy other kinds of breads or pastries. They also serve main courses as well as soups. Definitely a good place to hang out during the rainy days or during tea time. Will be back for more soon :)",

I had asked for something that they didn't have because it was so close to closing time, so I chose a ham and cheese bread and a focaccia instead. They were delicious! They warmed up the food for me to take back to my hotel, and I also got a free croissant because I had bought 2 breads. Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was prompt and friendly.",

All were tasty, but I would say the baguette was most impressive especially because I had it when it had just come out of the oven \u00a0(still warm)! Seating here is limited and the tables and stools are small. Best for solo or duo seating. \u00a0Terrible place to come with a large group.The employees were very friendly and helpful and I liked their music selection too. Would come back again next time I'm in the area!",

    "text": "You have my heart at baked anything, and i can never say no to freshly baked breads, pastries, cakes, you name it. It's the smell of butter and sugar probably, both of which i cannot resist and that resulted in a shopping spree when i stumbled into Bread and Hearth, a new artisanal bakery in the Keong Saik/ Chinatown/ Ann Siang area. Bread and Hearth prides themselves with using pure butter and quality ingredient. There is absolutely no shortening used, as highlighted by the friendly staff. French Normandy butter and flour goes into making these quality pastries.The Matcha Orange is a bread roll with a nice matcha fragrance and the flavor is lifted by the refreshing chunky orange peel. The Honey Chocolate bread ($3) was porous and very bouncy. Even though it said Honey Chocolat, it wasn't sweet at all and it actually had a salty taste. That said, i still like how it was flavored nicely with the dark chocolate chip bits. Do add some honey to it after you toast it. I swear it's divine.The Bacon Focaccia ($6.50) is exactly that kinda bread that i'd want for a breakfast. The fragrance was taunting me during work the whole afternoon and i finally succumbed to my weakness and took several bites and boy was it satisfying. It's the perfect savory snack. I would eat the foccacia even if it didn't have bacon on it. The Cream Cheese Sesame ($2.80) turned out to be a sweet treat instead of a savory one! Think dense creamy cheese with a nice sweet pastry crust peppered with smokey sesame seeds. Yummy! Another must try is the Bostock which is more than 50% cake i swear. Bread and Hearth also does sandwiches and coffee and they do have a nice enough spot for lunch/tea.",
