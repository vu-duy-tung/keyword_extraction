There was a special Chinese New Year menu but she explained they are willing to do a lot of different dishes that may not appear on the menu. But no dumplings at dinner time. We ordered off the menu: a half roasted duck on the advice of a co-worker, Ong Choy with garlic sauce, Fried Rice, and Fried Prawns with Passion Fruit. The duck and shrimp I would absolutely get again. The rice was ok and the Ong Choy kept me from feeling guilty since it was a vegetable! It was all so good I went back the next day for lunch and dumplings!Lunch: \u00a0We ordered Shrimp Dumplings, Pork dumplings (spicy), Pork buns, Egg tarts, Deep fried shredded yam, and a Suckling pig and meat combination which consisted of pig, duck and shoua chicken. \u00a0Wow! Everything was excellent. This was one of my favorite places and best dim sum. Next time, I'd skip the yam so I could eat more egg tarts :)",

    "text": "Ma Fu Yuan (\u6ee1\u3000\u798f\u3000\u82d1) is a chinese, specifically Cantonese restaurant located at Intercontinental Hotel Singapore.My brother made a reservation for us today for dim sum. I do not remember if I had dined here before. I have definitely stayed in this hotel as well as had afternoon high tea here at their lobby lounge eons ago. My memory is getting fuzzy in recent times, I might have eaten in this chinese restaurant but anyhow that would be a long long time ago. So this review is the same like heading to an establishment which I do not know much about, not sure what to expect especially when the restaurant has a current standing of 3.5 stars on yelp. Not a good sign :(Oh well, I did tell myself if the lunch turned out to be bad, I can blame it on my brother, hehe even though I love my little brother very much.So how was the lunch? This restaurant definitely deserves more then a 3.5 stars. I am giving it a 4. The staffs were all very attentive. Service was top notch. The staffs even went and returned with tiny chairs so that some of us could sit comfortably with purses next to our plush chairs. Service would definitely earn this restaurant a \u00a05 stars but how about the food. Let's see..Prawn & mango roll - A+ Definitely my favorite! It's crispy on the outside, prawns and mango were fresh)duck meat spring roll with yam - B+ The combination was rather odd to me. My brother likes it though but since I am the one writing this review, this will be a B+ dishPrawn dumplings - A. A dish no respectable restaurant in Singapore should messed up. Prawns were fresh and dumpling skin thin and soft (what a good dumpling should always be. Minced pork dumplings with scallops - A. Like the prawn dumplings, they were good, as expected. Rice roll with BBQ meat and coriander - A+ This would be my #2 favorite dish. The meat was so tender, the rice roll was so soft. The coriander brought everything together. It cost a little more than other dishes but totally worth it.Honey glazed BBQ pork buns - A. The buns were fluffy, the meat inside was savory. Maybe my expectation is too high, or simply, if any decent Cantonese restaurant cannot produce good bbq pork buns, they should close the restaurant and maybe sell shoes. Why shoes? Errr.. I don't know. Perhaps, shoes just go by sizes and perhaps width too. Ok, my jet lag is still lingering, can't think properly but any smart person will understand what I am trying to say here.Yam Croquette - A. They were good, but not enough to make me want to return and order the same.Chilled Mango Sago with Pomelo - C. Usually a dessert at the end of any meal would made me very happy, just not this one. The dessert had too much sugar in it, not much mango pur\u00e9e. I declared at the table I could make this at home and taste a whole lot better, that would just mean this dessert completely failed. I still could not understand why the dessert turned up to be so disappointing.I left the restaurant feeling unsatisfied and that was the reason why I took off one star here.",

From now till 31 May 2014, Man Fu Yuan is serving some glorious dishes from the good old days, made using good quality ingredients and special and laborious techniques. Now here are some favorites from the Nostalgic Menu. The flavourful Mixed Beef Stew with handmade beef balls \u725b\u4ec0\u725b\u4e38\u7172 ($28 per portion). I love how the meat is tender and savory. The beef balls were succulent and had nice chunks of water chestnut in them. This is the perfect comfort food.Tea-smoked Pork Belly Char Siew \u8106\u76ae\u53c9\u70e7 ($24 per portion) takes centre stage, featuring pork belly marinated in a combination of Chinese rose wine and barbecue sauce. It's fatty and decadent but hey YOLO. I loved the Hong Kong Style Steamed Pork Belly in Shrimp Paste \u6e2f\u5f0f\u54b8\u867e\u9171\u84b8\u82b1\u8089 ($28 per portion). This is another comfort dish and i can fully identify with the flavors though i've never had this dish before. Salty, stinky and oh damn delicious. Give me another 2 bowls of rice.Pig Trotters with Vinegar \u732a\u811a\u918b \u00a0($28 per portion). The meat was well braised in plum vinegar and you can smell the sour perfume from far. The dish is on the oily side though. Ended dinner with some Hashima. It typically comes served in a coconut but Chef wasn't too pleased with the coconut that day.If you find these flavors familiar and are craving for it now, Man Fu Yuan's A Taste of Nostalgia Menu will be available as part of a rotating a la carte menu available daily till 31 May 2014. Do call the restaurant to find out if they'll be serving your favorite dish before heading down!",

    "text": "Man Fu Yuan, which means \"Garden of Prosperity,\" is one of Singapore's finest Chinese restaurants, serving classic Cantonese cuisine. It is a perfect place to impress both your business associates as well as your grandparents.Food : We really liked the trio of dim sum, which showcased both traditional handcrafted dim sum and novelty items with a twist. The old school \"hum sui kok\" (deep-fried glutinous rice dumplings filled with meat) were delightful golden parcels that were both chewy and soft on the inside and crisp on the outside. The chilli crab tart removes the hassle of eating the popular crustacean dish by encasing its meat in buttery pastry crust, while the scallop rice roll is presented in a deliciously deconstructed manner.One of Man Fu Yuan's signature dishes is the stewed noodles with lobster, with good reason. Steeped in a flavoursome stock made from lobster, clams, and mussels, the al dente rice noodles are a perfect accompaniment to the juicy chunks of lobster stir-fried with ginger and spring onion. Another favourite would be the deep-fried salted egg yolk buns - the best we have ever tasted! Imagine biting into a deep fried mantou (bread) and having hot salted egg yolk oozing out like lava and filling your mouth. We were at a lost for words.By the time dessert came around, we were stuffed, but we absolutely couldn't resist the tantalizing hue of golden orange calling our names. The cream of Japanese pumpkin topped with coconut ice cream and black glutinous rice was surprisingly light yet velvety, providing a wonderful finish to our meal.Ambience : Great for business lunches with its blend of modern and traditional Peranakan touches.Service : Excellent!",

    "text": "proper good cantonese cooking at this old hotel standby in bugis. this place used to be a family favorite (we're talking more than five or six years ago) - and then they switched chefs, standards dropped, and there was that case of food poisoning on the news - all of which meant we stopped coming here.but we decided to give it a go recently - and I can't be more pleased to tell you that the food is as good as it used to be, and it deserves its reputation as a cantonese stronghold reinstated.the thing about these grand hotel-located chinese restaurants (such as summer pavilion), is that they are judged against a more stringent yardstick - and allowed to charge higher prices for fulfilling that potential. so when they're good, as in this case, it really is some fantastic cooking.we started off with a bowl of winter melon soup each - intensely-flavored consomme with a round of melon, crunchy prawns and bits of scallops. we always order this when we come here, though it used to be served as an entire small gourd with soup within - this is a smaller serve, but beautifully done all the same.our mains started with a plate of sweet-and-sour monkey head mushroom: decent, and I suspect would have been impressive if we don't often order a better rendition at lingzhi (where the larger cuts of mushroom have a meatier texture).we were blown away by the sauteed beef with garlic chips though - so tender, and beefy, and that black pepper sauce just coating the cubes (without any of that gross gloppiness).these were followed by a claypot of braised beancurd sheets and vegetables - I love vegetables anyway, but these were tender and more savory than you'd associate with meatlessness.a plate of chicken steamed with wood's ear and salty fermented beancurd was undoubtedly homey - and rather anaemic on the plate apart from that bright garnish - but delicious all the same.a couple of us finished with dessert - hashima served hot in a coconut shell, as well as a bowl of cheery pumpkin served with black glutinous rice and ice-cream.good food doesn't lend itself to much description - this place serves as up expert cantonese food, and its always-posh decor makes it great for bringing the parents or impressing guests.",
