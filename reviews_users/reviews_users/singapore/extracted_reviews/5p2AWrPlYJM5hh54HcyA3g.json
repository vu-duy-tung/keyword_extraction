    "text": "tldr - good food but unacceptable service at this price point.My family visited on 7th July 2018 on the strong recommendation of a relative (we were planning to visit the other well-reviewed Greek restaurant in Singapore).It is true that this is one of the two Greek restaurants in Singapore worth its salt (or olive oil). Signature Greek items were very well executed - the taramosalata was rich and creamy without being overpowering. Of the items we ordered, we thought that Bakalaki did a better job on some while Blu Kouzina (the other Greek restaurant) did a better job on others. Overall, high-quality food.The service, however, was abysmal. I would have written it off if the poor service occurred once, but it happened four times - it was difficult to get anyone's attention to (a) get water refilled, (b) order additional items, (c) ask for the dessert menu, (d) pay.In fact, there were a few occasions where some staff walked by us to the shelves near to where we were sitting to do their thing, and they seemed to take extra care to avoid eye contact with me. The unnecessary delays added up and by the time we received the dessert menu, we decided to skip dessert.One possibility is that we were seated near a large group and the waiters were busy with that group. However, the maitre d should have assigned waiters accordingly. At Bakalaki's price point, this level of service was not acceptable.",

    "text": "The food is good but probably less so than my other favourite Greek in Singapore. Most items were ordered were good, from the starters to mains to desserts. That said, the service here can be greatly improved. We made reservations more than 2 weeks in advance for a special occasion for 10 people. Yet, when our party arrived (10 minutes earlier than reservation time), our table had been given away. We knew this because we were told that our table was prepared but they were accidentally given away to a group of tourists. We had to wait for tables to be vacated, cleaned, set. We were initially squeezed into 2 tables, that was then extended to 3 when some other diners left. The service recovery was poor. I would be reluctant to return, especially when treated impatiently when the fault lies with the restaurant.In addition, the acoustics at this place is bad so it is not recommended for intimate/romantic dinners.",

All of the Greek places I tried before this place seemed to me that they were serving middle eastern food poorly prepared. This place is different!We went with the mixed meat platter for two and everything they had was good. I specially enjoyed the spiciness of the beef sausage and also enjoyed the lamb chop the most. The meatball is really good as well. The chicken yorio and the kebab are ok but nothing special. The portion is good for two people and you should order one starter if you aren't planning to eat dessert. We opted to eat dessert and ordered baklava and they gave us Greek yogurt on the House. The baklava was just ok nothing special. I would skip dessert next time but the meat there was really good.Highly recommend you reserve a table given it was fully reserved when we arrived and sat on the bar side",

    "text": "My Big Fat Greek Dinner It's been a while since we went to our favourite Greek restaurant (we shall just call it the old place) and I was shocked when I discovered that the entire management team had changed. After some quick research by the wife, we discovered that they've ventured out to open Bakalaki Greek Taverna at Seng Poh Road and we knew that we had to head down to give it a try. First impressions. It felt like being home again. The warm greeting from George and Christos is always something to look forward to and we loved how Bakalaki felt a lot like the original place at Upper Bukit Timah (with a lot more space). Saganaki Kefalotyri ($16.90)This simple looking dish has always been one of my favourite. This beautifully pan fried Kefalotyri is not overly salty and melting with goodness. Topped with a squeeze of lemon and it brings out the richness and flavours of the cheese wonderfully. Perffffferrcccctttttt! Best eaten hot! Horiatiki ($20.90)Definitely one of the best Traditional Greek salad around. The wife who doesn't normally enjoy raw salads really love the Greek salad here. The Cherry tomatoes used are amazingly sweet, mixed with the freshness of the cucumber, pungent-ness of the onions, the saltiness of the olives, creaminess of the feta and the brightness of lemon juice made this salad an absolute delight to have! Pita Bread ($2.90)The pitas here don't look like much but they are so so good. Light, almost fluffy, they go absolutely perfect with the dips (5 different dips) that are available. That hint of salt added a nice dimension to the pita while the oregano gave it a nice, earthiness to the pita.Dips ($14.90 - $15.90 for single portions or $16.90 for 2 half portions)We went with the 2 half portions for the variety and tried their Taramosalata (Cod roe dip) and the classic Tzatziki (cucumber and Greek yogurt). A little strange not seeing Hummus on the menu but at least it got us trying something different. The tzatziki was fantastic. Light, refreshing and a real palette cleanser as we moved from dish to dish. The Taranosalata on the other hand really packed it punch! It was wonderfully rich, salty yet had this brightness to it because of the lemon juice. And I might get murdered for this but it went perfectly well with not only the pita but with the potato and grilled octopus tentacles. Paidakia ($32.90 for 3 pieces) The lamp chops here are a must have and a favourite here. The lamp is wonderfully marinated, ensuring that, for the lesser fans of lamb, there isn't that overpowering smell of lamb. It's perfectly seasoned and the knife cuts through the meat like butter. It had the perfect amount of meat to fat ratio, ensuring the lamb chops remain juicy and succulent. For those who used to frequent the old place and know how good the lamb is, the ones here are as fantastic!Htapodi ($32.90)Another favourite and must have is the grilled octopus tentacles. A lot of love and care goes into cooking octopus tentacles (legs), ensuring that they come on tender and succulent. Grilling them alone isn't enough and it often takes and hour or so of braising. The octopus here doesn't get any more perfect. Juicy, succulent, tender, it is absolute bursting with the flavours of the mediterranean. \u00a0A must have, whether you're a regular or visiting for the first time. Thanks to Christos, we managed to try 2 new desserts on their menu.Rizogalo ($11.90)This creamy rice pudding was really quite a surprise. It looked really heavy but was actually very light, not overly sweet and perfect after a flavourful meal. Loukoumades ($14.90)Little puffs of sunshine. These little traditional Greek doughnuts and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Drizzled with honey and dipped in the chocolate at the side, it brought a little burst of happiness with every bite. Overall, I loved the hospitality of Bakalaki. It feels like you're being welcomed to a great big Greek family dinner every time you're there. The ambience is very nice and open and with a fairly open concept, it doesn't feel stuffy or stifling and makes for a very comfortable dining experience.",

The food and service were both impeccable and left me in high spirits the rest of the day. I especially enjoyed the grilled octopus, which was juicy, soft and flavourful! The dips were also nicely paired with the warm toasted pita bread that was peppered with some herbs and coarse salt. The house wines added a nice touch to the meal as well.",

    "text": "they have easily displaced blu kouzina as my new favourite greek restaurant in sg!the spaciousness, airiness and welcoming thematic decor takes them a notch above the competition even before you get a chance to differentiate their plates.and as soon as you take that first lick of taramosalata off the olive oil glistened pita you will want more, asap.a greek salad like none i have had in greece, really fresh, generous and a good balance of texture, colour and acidity. just a little heavy on the salt, in my opinion and a common thread when it comes to the meat dishes.the pan seared greek cheese smoothly rounded off my selection of appetizers.so the eye is bigger than the stomach? the staff will beckon you not to over order.portions err on the excessive side, so under order if you must.i wanted both the meat platter and the seafood platter but was knowledgeably adviced against it by our more than helpful server.he gently steered us away from the meat platter and we ended up ordering the seafood platter with a lamb chop main to supplement my carnivorous desire.yes, grilling is definitely one of their strengths and the lamb chops stood no chance.devoured within seconds of arrival, medium rare and tender as one would expect.but the seafood platter is the highlight and i am glad i listened to my server.it's just less of the same and a better variety with more varied cooking methods.the whole sea bream is easily de-boned and demolished from head to tail.crispy calamari pieces were quickly snapped up like savoury popcorn.while the more mature octopus satiated the more adult palates.their version is lightly charred for a fuller flavour yet with a baby butt tender bite.the two big butterflied prawns was easy fodder even for non skilled peelers.was left craving to try some other meat and the beef skewer souvlaki was quickly nominated to fill just that void.the longish wait however detracted somewhat from the enjoyment when it did finally arrive.best order all at once.if you are lucky enough, a complimentary dessert of greek honey and cinnamon doughnut balls with chocolate dipping sauce will comatose you.efkaristo bakalaki!",

We over ordered our food and finished off every morsel of it. My mom and I are vegetarians and unlike a usual dinner outing, we could eat almost everything on the table (except for a meat platter ordered by the rest of our group and was raved about). Don't forget to eat the desserts (or at least the yogurt with honey!!!) - you won't regret it. The food is so fresh and make with excellent ingredients that you won't feel anything but light and ridiculously happy after eating it :)",
