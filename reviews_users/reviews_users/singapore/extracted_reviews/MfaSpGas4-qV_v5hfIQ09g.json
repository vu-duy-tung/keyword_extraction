    "text": "My fav restaurant to get my Thai food fix! Nara Thai at ION Orchard lose way big time to this humble establishment. Lunch set at $5-6, you'd get a delicious dish at a generous portion. The atmosphere here is very busy esp during lunch time, and thus can be quite noisy. However, you must try their thai ice tea here at $1. Really nice Thai Ice Tea at a very cheap price. I come here so many times for lunch (due to close proximity from my office) and taste wise they are very consistent.My favorites are their pork basil rice + egg (S$6) & garlic pork rice (S$5). If you don't mention anything about the spicy level, by default their pork basil will come out very spicy (at least to my taste it is indeed very spicy), thus, if you don't have a high spicy-ness tolerance like me, adjust it accordingly.Service wise, the servers all are very quick to serve you - may it be tending your table or cleaning up a table for you. When it comes to pay to your bill, if you're in rush, just go up to the cashier and pay there. It'll be faster that way.",

The pork knuckle was tender and melt in the mouth. Delicious. The iced Thai milk tea is very good.",

Prices are good and even with a bottle or two of Singha beer is unlikely to break the bank. Larb Nam Tok is my favourite - good meat and spicy enough. This restaurant is also popular with the wife and kids (Popya -spring rolls- work well for the younger ones).",

    "text": "This is a review of dinner with a friend at Bahn Beer Thai Restaurant in Golden Mile Tower.We went here on the recommendation of my friend. \u00a0Good recommendation!This was one of my better Thai dining experiences in Singapore.The ambiance is relatively basic. \u00a0It is neat and organized though. \u00a0There are numerous photos of notable people who have dined there on the wall.tinyurl.com/q6hax6fThe service was very casual but relatively friendly and functional. \u00a0We were quickly seated. \u00a0The restaurant was less than half full. \u00a0Our order was taken soon after. \u00a0It wasn't long before our food was brought to the table. \u00a0Do not expect an in-depth service here. \u00a0They will not be coming over and asking if you enjoy your meal or anything like that. \u00a0But, they get the job done and this is very much aligned with the service I expect at Thai restaurants.The food ranged from good to very good. \u00a0I would actually say that most of it was very good. \u00a0While nothing fancy, all of the food was well presented.Food Collage Photo:tinyurl.com/orgfuxwBecause it was his recommendation, I asked my friend to handle the ordering.Fried Pork - These were crispy little bites of fried pork. \u00a0With a dip into the sauce, they made for delightfully tasty morsels of fried pig. \u00a0One odd thing, after we had almost completed the entirety of this dish, the server brought over a different sauce for the dish. \u00a0tinyurl.com/nq872szThai Sambal Greens - This was the weakest dish. \u00a0And not just because they were greens. \u00a0They actually tasted quite good. \u00a0They didn't have the hot kick I expected. But they were flavourful. \u00a0I found them to be very tough and this made them difficult to eat. \u00a0I had to resort to some quite untidy eating with hands.tinyurl.com/q4kfhzcChicken Curry - This was very good. \u00a0The chicken was tender. \u00a0The vegetables were prepared well. \u00a0Even though I could see the chili oil, this dish also didn't really have the heat I expected. \u00a0I did really enjoy it though.tinyurl.com/qhtqk5lSeafood Fried Rice - I am not the biggest fan of fried rice. \u00a0Rice is one of the few foods in the world that I prefer the non-fried versions of. \u00a0However, I did really like this fried rice. \u00a0It wasn't \u00a0overly oily. It was perfectly prepared. \u00a0Unlike some seafood rice, there was a delicate nature to the flavour of the seafood in the rice. \u00a0It didn't simply overpower the dish.tinyurl.com/ohy6rglLime Juice - They have a nice lime juice. \u00a0I do not know if they prepare it or not. \u00a0It had a very mild flavour and I found it refreshing. \u00a0I also thought it was a good match for the strong flavours of Thai food.tinyurl.com/ocohyyy.Price (Dinner for 2): \u00a0$61.62Overall - I found this to be an enjoyable dining experience. \u00a0The quality food is certainly the anchor of Bahn Beer Thai. \u00a0The service and ambiance are both relatively standard. \u00a0It is the type of place that I would consider returning to. \u00a0Because of its location, it might be more of a neighbourhood favourite than a destination restaurant. \u00a0But if you do not have a favourite Thai spot and have a strong hankerin' for some Thai food, you might find it worth the trip.",

    "text": "Once you get past the smell and overall dodgy feeling of Golden Mile Tower, Beerthai is a relatively decent restaurant for a mix of Thai & local Singaporean food.They offer a mix of authentic Thai dishes (Green Curry, Pad Thai etc) with a select few local foods (Chicken Rice etc). The food is quite cheaply priced although not as cheap as a food court. I ordered the Green Curry fried rice with a fresh Thai coconut and came in just under $10.The interiors are nicer than other restaurants in Golden Mile, by nicer i mean at least the chairs match the tables. Seems to be a good place for a quick work lunch if your office is on Beach Road and judging by the variety of food on the menu I'd definitely come back a few times and try out some other dishes.",

    "text": "There is a lot of Thai food in Singapore. \u00a0Bold, sweet, salty, sour tastes - what's not to like? But not all Thai food is created equal and this is my favorite Thai restaurant in Singapore.Golden Mile Tower is a dark little patch on Beach road with charter buses to and from Malaysia and other locales. It is next to Golden Mile Complex which is essentially a little Thai Town. \u00a0But Beer Thai is a standalone restaurant a stone's throw from the other Thai restaurants and it is a little easier to find seating here.The food:Expect all of your authentic and typical Thai dishes including pad Thai, pineapple rice, olive rice, fresh fish cakes, mango salad, and a selection of curries. \u00a0This is mainly Thai food and there aren't many local dishes, unlike what the previous reviewer stated. What makes this place stand out is the fact that each of the dishes is executed well and has more of a bold flavor than you would get at a Thai Express; the fresh herbs and ingredients are really highlighted here. \u00a0A standout dish is the steamed fish with house sauce - the house sauce is a bean and chili sauce that pairs beautifully with the fish. I also love the chicken green curry, green curry rice, and morning glories (listed as kang kong). I haven't tried the \"Lord of the Seas\" fish extravaganza, but supposedly it has won an award so I am curious about the dish. \u00a0Any meal ends well with a mango sticky rice, but this dish can run out quickly.The interior is average and the service is fine. \u00a0Many of the waitresses are Thai but understand English well enough. \u00a0I won't come back for the decor, but will come here again for the reliable, flavorful food. \u00a0But don't just take my word for it - the Thai Embassy has used this restaurant for catering (which is why we have tried it in the first place!)",
