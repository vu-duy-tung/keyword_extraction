You order at the main counter, serve yourself water and cutlery, and they bring your food to you. We had the mentaiko salmon pasta, the salmon pho and the salted egg mochi w ice cream. For the price, portions of the mains aren't particularly large, but maybe the restaurant's strategy is to leave room for dessert! The mentaiko salmon pasta was done perfectly. Al dente pasta, al dente salmon and creamy mentaiko. Mmm mmm mmm! The salmon pho, is a completely different dish. The broth and noodles are delicate, but the salmon was a tad overdone. Otherwise, it's a really nice dish. The salted egg mochi was ah-mazing! I dont know if any other restaurants do it, but it's definitley a heart stopper. They also give 3 mochis, so be prepared to fight if sharing between an even number of people!",

    "text": "Simple yet satisfying menu. The highlight for most will be the mochi balls with surprise runny filling inside, however, the savory items are worth a try too! The opening hours on a Saturday was surprisingly late at noon, but I'm glad my sister and I waited for its opening. There was no wait and we got promptly seated. The menu consists of 5 major components - risotto (rice), pasta, waffles, dessert and drinks. You pick your favorite and then head on over to order at the counter. We tried the mentaiko prawn pasta, that comes with a free drink. The mentaiko flavor was hit the right spot, the pasta was cooked al dente and the prawns were bouncy and chewy. The lemongrass chamomile tea I chose to go along was strong and intense with lemongrass, so might not be suitable for folks who are sensitive to its taste. The truffle fries was not anything special - freezer fries, thinly cut. The truffle smell is good but did not have much truffle flavor, as in many other restaurants. The highlight of the meal is the dessert! We got the salted egg yolk mochi balls and cookie butter ice cream. The delicious cornflakes gave amazing texture to the smooth ice cream. I would say the salted egg yolk could be saltier and the cookie butter ice cream was sweet enough without honey. I enjoyed the mentaiko pasta but it's quite small a portion, good for customers with small appetite. My favorite was the mochi salted egg yolk balls and I would be back to have more! My sister and I really enjoyed the industrial design and benches in the restaurant. Cozy and rustic. I would say the two person seat near the door was a little stuffy so try to sit closer to the inner restaurant.",

It is known for its thick toast and waffle.Classic Honey Toast ($12.90)butter & honey baked pain de mie, honey yogurt ice-cream, berriesThe thick toast is served thick and crispy. Just nice with the honey and ice-cream. The sour taste of the berries is balanced by the sweet honey and ice cream. Overall not bad except for the raspberry which tastes frozen.Blackcurrent Lemonade ($4.90)It looks quite cloudy when served. When fully mixed, I could not taste the lemonade in the drink. It tastes more like a soda drink. None of the grape flavour too.Overall not bad. The place is a bit dim in lighting, so difficult to take photos even when sitting by the window.",

    "text": "Cool ambiance, ok-only food. We stumbled upon Stateland while trying to find the famous Bugis Village. Stateland Cafe presents \u00a0a cool, inviting and hipster interior. The pictures of desserts on their menu looked pretty promising so we stepped in to try it out. Unfortunately, the pictures looked much better than the way the food tasted. We ordered a watermelon shaved ice dessert and an earl grey donuts with soft serve. The earl grey donuts had a very fragile and light taste to it, and the soft serve also had a light creamy taste that vaguely reminded me of Momofuku milk bar in NYC. The watermelon shaved ice dessert looked smaller in reality compared to its glorious pictures on the menu. But, there was more flavor in it, and tasted like a frozen watermelon smoothie. Stateland Cafe's got the cool vibe. All it has to do is give a little more punch in its food and it'll provide a much better experience.",

At the moment Brother Bird is also housed in the restaurant, \u00a0which is great because it means I barely have to move for soft serve. The lemonade drink wasn't perfect though. Definitely needs to be more tart, sour and lemony!!!",

    "text": "We went to Stateland Cafe yesterday after reading Ladyironchef's post about the best waffles in Singapore. Stateland's ambience is pretty similar to most of the small \"hipster\" cafes in Singapore - dim lighting, uncovered ceilings, eclectic decorations that seemed to be randomly put together to give a rustic, simple vibe. The menu was more interesting. There were not many things on the menu, but the choices sounded delicious. I was intrigued by the unique waffle flavours and opted for the Red Velvet Waffle. My partner took the Bacon and Eggs Waffle.The Red Velvet Waffle looked impressive, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and raspberries set atop drizzles of cream cheese frosting and dark chocolate sauce on a red waffle base. The first few bites were confusing. I couldn't recognise the taste at all. The waffle had a yeasty, metallic taste that had me doubting my choice. A few more bites into it helped to ease my concerns as the familiar bitter and savoury taste took over. It helped to combine all components in one bite to fully savour the waffle. It was good, but I would try other things on the menu next time.I prefer the Bacon and Eggs Waffle. It had a good, earthy taste that kept me wanting more. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and the onion cream sauce, infused with the smoky bacon aroma, added another dimension to the flavour. Two thumbs up.The prices were a little on the high side, though I wouldn't call them expensive. At $14.90 for a waffle dish, it's higher than most other waffle places, but the flavours are definitely unique.",

    "text": "Given what I went through to get Sunday brunch in Kampong Glam, Stateland deserves 5 stars.Initially, hubby and I went to Maison Ikkoku, but they were already fully booked by 10 AM. Trusty Yelp app pointed us to Working Title, where apparently the chef was running late which meant the sole person running the F&B portion was unable to cook breakfast.Almost ready to quit and just eat something at Bugis, I decided to give it one more try and check out Stateland.Available seating? Yes.Fully functional cafe with chefs eager to cook breakfast-y items at 10:15 AM on Sunday? Yes.Pitchers of water available for water guzzlers like my hubby so the waitstaff won't be bothered? Yes.Migs ordered the French Toast, which was covered in a berry compote of sorts. Looks too sweet in the picture, but trust me, it was perfect. I decided last minute to go the savoury route and had the waffle with the bacon and onion cream sauce. It sounds really weird and looks crazy but it actually turned out being wonderful. The waffle was firm enough to hold the sauce, but not burnt or overcooked. The bacon and cream sauce was balanced out perfectly with the sweet sauteed onions. Throw in some decent cappuccinos and brunch near Arab St was saved. Stateland, if you keep this service up, I'll love you long time.",

Cafes here are quite common as well in the area, such as La Marelle, CAD Cafe, and even the recently opened Elffin &amp; Elffin. Stateland Cafe has become the newest addition to this area. Also operating a online macaroons business called Flag &amp; Sac, this place serves all-day breakfasts, pastas and desserts.The menu here is rather simple, and reasonably priced.The coffees here are made using the Terra Firma blends from Papa Palheta. The Macchiato ($3.90) provides a single shot of espresso, which has a slightly acidic and bitter taste.The Latte ($4.70) tasted strong and firm with the right amount of milk added.The Belgium Waffles ($10.90) comes with a chocolate ice cream, fresh fruits and Stateland's waffle sauce. This is possibly one of the best waffles coming from a cafe. Crusty on the outside, soft and moist on the inside, this goes well especially with the chocolate ice cream.This place is a great place to come to for their coffee and food after some shopping within the area, so if you are around the Kampong Glam area, this should not be missed!",
