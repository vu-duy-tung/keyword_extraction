    "text": "The Hainan Hokkien Mee stall B1-34 serves $4 no nonsense hokkien mee. It's the dry version, and it's quite good. Not the best I've tasted, but I think it's just preference. They could've had more eggs in it, and a better balance of the beehoon and yellow noodles. Beehoon overpowered the noodles.The Sugar Cane stall at the level 1 was okay. If you want the small cup size you gotta mention it, otherwise they'll give you the $1.5 cup by default. Also, their barley drink doesn't have the barley bits, I was fooled by their pics.The char kway tiao stall at 01-37 was pretty good. It was too sweet (from the soy sauce) in my opinion, but the chye sim (leafy green veggie) was perfectly cooked, and the cockles were fresh. So if you like your sweet soy sauce, you'd love it. Comes in 3 sizes, $3, $4 and $5.Gotta try the other stalls. But this hawker centre still hasn't beat Amoy FC.",

Sad to say some stalls are no longer operating like the clay pot rice ( there is another stall but not original) and goodies like Salim Satay.",

    "text": "Ok, yes there is shopping upstairs, but this place is really about the hawker stalls below. Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite spots to chow down in Singapore and not just because the likes of Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern have feasted on Sup Tulang to their red fingered delight. (order this baby and you'll know what I mean by \"red fingered')No, the reason I stop in here as they really do have a nice selection of hawker stands, so you can have a Singaporean smorgasbord with little or no effort. But for me, it is all about the Sup Tulang or Red Bone Marrow soup. A dish so tasty that it stirs my primal caveman to the point that I almost feel like hunting and gathering,,well almost. It really is a gluttonous experience as the Sup Tulang's \u00a0red dye gets over everything. Yes, you can try to suck out its marrow with a straw, but I tell you that you might as well surrender, wearing something to which you can afford to say goodbye, and go for it. Basically, you and your clothing are about to be stained in red, and the Sup Tulang mark will stay with you all day long. In a way, it was my Red Badge of Courage, for it marked my courage to dive into Sup Tulang's yumminess at the same time marking my shame for being such a messy glutton. I wish \u00a0that I could have figure a better way to manage its red deliciousness, but not all the bubble tea in Singapore,\"will sweeten these little hands.\" Oh well, maybe next time I will bring a body bib.",

    "text": "This is next door to my office and so we eat here quite regularly. Perhaps it is because I am familiar with it, but it is my favorite hawker centre in Singapore. It has a wide variety of food options on the basement and first floors, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Japanese, Western, Vegeterian, and more. I really think this one has it all.During lunch the seating can get a bit crowded, but a table can usually be found, even if a few minute wait is needed. Fortunately, none of the stalls harass you about where you sit and what you order, not allowed anywhere but common in many centres. It isn't air conditioned, but the fans are plenty and even on the hottest days it is quite comfortable even in work clothes. Now, onto my favorite and recommended stalls, in no particular order:B1-35 - Chicken Rice, I think one of the better ones in Singapore, the chicken is served hot and the chili is nice as well. Unfortunately, this stall has been randomly closed on different days in the past year, and when it is open, it is a long wait to get your food, walk up, get your order on the list, and sit waiting for your food to come out. Fortunately the delivery lady shuffling along in her slippers will go anywhere in the basement. $3.50 for a standard set which includes soup, but no veggie.B1-56 - Claypot, this is in the basement corner near Beach Road. It has always been good, never any bones, and handles special requests such as no fish or chicken only, easily. This stall is closed on Thursdays. This does take a while as well, but will also serve anywhere in the basement. It is $5 for a single serving.1-70 - Roasted Duck/meats. This is my standard Char Siew stall cheap and tasty, $2/3 depending on size, and comes with soup. The chili is good and the service is very fast. I get stuck in a rut and haven't ordered their other dishes, but my coworkers like the duck and mixed meat orders as well.1-73 - Local Noodles. I haven't eaten here, but co-workers and my wife will line up for this uncles food and they aren't the only ones, it always has a queue. It is closed on Mondays.Those are my suggestion for the stalls to visit, but there are many more to try as well.",

The (cockle) char kway teow stall was very standard though. They mixed two different types of noodles together and it ended up resembling someone's food scraps. Tossed it after a few tentative bites. This place is probably one of the more run down food centres. Went primarily because the claypot rice there had good reviews and for the overall \"local\" experience.",

This place should be called 'Golden Mile Food Centre and Camping Market'.Any self respecting Singaporean male citizen worth his salt would know about this place. Affectionally known to everyone as the 'Army market\", Golden mile food centre is centrally located in the 'town area' of Singapore.Every weekend, national servicemen flock to this place to pick up extra supplies that they might need for all their outfield needs. Granted, this is not an easy place to shop. There are many field camp supply stores that sell things at different prices and haggling here is part of the fun. You would need to have a guide that knows the general pricing. A 'blur' serviceman or a tourist might not get the cheapest deals.Quality of the products differ here and there and it's safer to ask different stalls for pricing to aid your purchasing. A true SIngaporean 'rite of passage' landmark for the boys.",

    "text": "Golden Mile Food Centre, full of famous food. But in this review, I'm going to review their upper levels, the one and only infamous \"Beach Road Army market\". The army market is famous for the sale of army related items. In this case, it is not rifles, bullets, night vision goggles. It is more of uniform, camping supplies, insignia sewing services etc. Traditionally, this place has been the one-stop for all servicemen, especially recruits who are looking to purchase cheap items for use in camp. They sell a wide variety of items such as bags, \"black tape\", rank, garters, boots, uniform etc. While they do have a wide variety of items, they do not sell the army standard issue items, meaning that the uniforms are of a different manufacturer despite looking alike. So an advice for servicemen is to check the products thoroughly and consult if they can be used in camp (especially when it comes to parade items such as their \"smartest 4\"). Now, the huge turn off about this place is the harassment of some stall owners and the can't-be-bothered attitude of other stall owners. I find that the harassing stalls are the more irritating ones as they tend to harass you by asking \"what do you want today?\" and then introducing random items to you as you walk pass. This does not help if you're walking down the stretch of stalls that have Malay teens as their sales assistants. There seems to be some discrepancies in pricing as well and you might be overcharged for certain cheap items such as camouflage creams. It will be best to know what the standard prices are before bum-rushing into any stall and ordering everything off the stall. As much as it is the place of cheap army related goods, there are still some stalls trying to rip customers off (especially if they see you have no hair and wearing black-rimmed specs). In addition, I would like to emphasize once again that these are not the standard army-issue goods, so their quality can be shady and product appearances might vary. Name tags might have different fonts, uniform might have different color tones, etc. These are the discrepancies in quality that might cause a poor serviceman to receive extra guard duty for not having parade-conformed uniform.Overall, I find that unless one absolutely has to, one should avoid purchasing from the army market and seek to get their supplies from Chevrons @ Jurong east.",
