    "text": "Bergs has uniquely flavoured burgers that you can't really find anywhere else. Their patties are made fresh and some served with a special bergs sauce that's really juicy and adds flavour to the burger.What I love most about Bergs is the variety - there's a lot of options to choose from - and also the portions which are huge. I had a large berg once for lunch and totally skipped dinner for that day because I was just too stuffed. In my opinion, the best thing on the menu is The Berg, their house specialIf you come here for lunch be prepared to have a food coma right after :)",

    "text": "A place for gourmet burgers, at either 4inch or 5inch (berg size) sizes. This is a bit pricy although the burgers are tasty. It would have been more value if a side & a drink are included in the price. The Alamack fish burger $15.50 berg size) is crispy on the outside & tender on the inside. You also get a big leaf of fresh lettuce, onions, and Mayo. I would ask for more mayo on my burger. This place fills up very fast during lunch so grab a seat first while someone else orders. There is seating available inside as well as outside.",

    "text": "Actually I thought it's not exactly a gourmet burger, but yes a decent burger.Gourmet burger has gradually changed its definition over these years with many creative and gigantic burgers serve around the world. I feel that the burger does not justify the usual price tag. Thankfully, there's paid app which entitles 1 for 1 in this outlet, and lunch specials at more affordable rates. I won't pay for its usual price.Had dinner with 3 others here, and we ordered fries and onion rings for sharing. Chunky fries were served, and the onion rings are those frozen type u can get from supermarket, extremely nice kind.My order of grilled chicken in spicy portuguese sauce was great! It's spiciness is just right, and the meat patty is well flavored. Very big serving, and I had a hard time finishing up almost half a burger. I will order the smaller serving for sure the next time round (friend ordered a bigger burger for everyone since I was dining with 3 men)! The burger buns are thick, too thick! This place serves alcohol too, but I didn't get it since it's just Monday night and the week just got started.Conclusion, I feel that it's more like a fast food restaurant with bigger burger and alcohol, than a gourmet burger bar.",

    "text": "I loved the burger I had here. The Berg size is HUGE, so perhaps next time I'll try their regular sized burgers.I had the Crickey Too burger which comes with bacon, beetroot, cheese (Edam?) and their special sauces. The burger was fantastic, the bun was very nice and firm and kept the monstrous burger together nicely. \u00a0This is probably my new favorite burger joint in Singapore.The reason I can't give it 5 stars are two-fold:1) The bacon in my burger was not cooked properly. It was half-cooked. You know when you bite into bacon you want crisp. My bacon was like biting into a piece of rubber and when I pulled, the whole flimsy piece of bacon would drag out of my burger. Disgusting!2) My wife had the Berg burger and we both swore it tasted different than my patty. Our burgers should have both had the same patty but her's had middle-eastern spices and could possibly have been lamb. We told the guys and they swore up and down they were the same patty. We even went so far as to ask him to taste the patty and he still said this is how the Berg burger tastes. We were skeptical.Sad thing is, we'll probably be back as they still have darn good burgers!An order of chips is $5.50 but they are nice big thick pieces of steak fries as they are called in the states. They were slightly over-cooked but still tasted great.Our meal was like $35 for 2 burgers and an order of fries. Pricey!",

    "text": "Bergs is a gourmet burger place around the corner from my office. It's a pretty simple set up - line up and order, pay and then wait for your burger to be cooked. Somewhat similar to burger shacks in the States. The buck stops there however, as Bergs aims to be a gourmet grease fest for burger lovers. I've tried the Morning Glory and The Berg and my goodness the portions are huge and greasy. The Morning Glory comes with bacon and hash and they definitely fry them good 'til their dead. The Bergs homemade ice lemon tea is pretty sweet so I suggest diluting it. The restaurant is set up for casual dining so you will usually end up sharing a table and bench with someone. If you're too busy to eat your food sitting down, they can brown bag your burger for the office. If you like big greasy burgers and a food coma in the afternoon, this place is for you.",

    "text": "There's a Berg's just across the road from my office, and we've walked by many times thinking it was too expensive for us to have it for lunch more than once a fortnight. Once we did try it after craving for burgers, but hating how greasy and unhealthy the usual fast food joint meals always made us feel after eating, and it was a pleasant surprise. The burger patty was fresh, soft and not greasy at all, with a well seasoned taste that wasn't overly artificial or drowned in sauces like the usual fast food joint burgers. Their burgers were also a lot larger in size, and just a burger without any other sides like fries or wedges filled us up completely. Berg's offers a small alfresco style dining area for eat-in customers, as well as take-away service. That aside, we did try their wedges once, and it goes well with the tartar sauce that they provide. As with most gourmet eateries, it's the attention to detail that I like most, like how their wedges are prepared with a slight sprinkling of hot chili powder.",
