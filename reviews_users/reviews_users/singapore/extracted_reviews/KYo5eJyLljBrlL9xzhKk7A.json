If you feel that enjoying your European meals from air-conditioned Restaurants or Malls is too mainstream, try visiting here for a different experience, also skipping the additional service charges.The Swiss Farmer Platter is good for sharing for about 2 - 4 pax and consists of the Bavarian / Germans Staples like whole crispy pork knuckled, 2 selected German sausages, Achar, mashed potatoes, harsh browns and darkbeer sauce for pairing. From the look at it, the Asian Cuisine had somehow influenced the \"supposed-to-be\" German platter as the sauerkraut that I'm looking forward to has been exchanged for our Asian Achar. Portion are large and definitely economical as compared to the usual ones.Schweizer Bauern Platte (Swiss Farmer Platter) - $40.66The scene-stealer was perhaps none other than that salivating big pork knuckle that were cut into pieces. Meat was moist and fare better than the chain German Bistro that I had visited. Meat was marvelously tender and best to go with the given sauce.The Bavarian Pork Sausage was perfectly served in its plump texture and lend a good savoury bite with its juice bursting as we sank our teeth into them.Though those shredded potatoes that make up the Rosti may not be as fine as what we had from Marche, it was more fragrant and not very oily. Together with the platter, we topped up this at $5.50 only.Rosti - $5.50Having good memories from Hofbr\u00e4uhaus M\u00fcnchen in Germany, I had the Hofbr\u00e4u original. This is brewed by the brewery in Germany and the acquired taste was refreshingly light to go with some good german food! While for my guy friend, he prefers something stronger in flavour and went for the darker beer.Original Weiss Beer - $11 (1 Pint)Paulaner Dunkel - $11 (1 Pint)Stew K\u00fcche may not replace the restaurant environment and have limited seating but you can still call in for reservation. Overall, with menu being extensive, I find that its a good alternative if you are looking for more German Food options in Singapore.",

It might look like a typical coffee shop from the outside but all the food here are good even two wings and Eskimo are here! Pork knuckles and bubble tea! Can't go wrong with that! :) and so we ordered the squid ink pasta and 1.3kg pork knuckle total costing $40 but it was more than enough to share between 3 people :P we even had extras to take home! I think there might have been a kitchen cock up because we waited over an hour for our pork knuckles and we watched patrons that came later than us get their pork knuckles before us... It was quite aggravating and by the time the pork knuckles came.. I had already digested my stomach walls!!! Oh well! At least the squid ink pasta came out within 10 minutes of ordering!!! I would recommend making a reservation!",

    "text": "I came here 2 times before and the main attraction here for me was that they served Hofbr\u00e4uhaus Bier. Unfortunately when I got here at around 6+ on a Saturday evening, they ran out of it.Well, somehow they were probably having a lot of pork knuckle orders (I understand why) and our mixed grill order came first. The meats were ok, I guess for the price, it is fair. Next came the salad which was lettuce based with cucumbers, cherry tomatoes and onions. And then the wait began, we finished those 2 dishes in about 20 minutes. We kind of have to check on our order 3 times and about 1 hour 15 mins later, our pork knuckle order with sausages came. While the pork knuckle was hot, just cooked, the \u00a0sausages, hashbrown and potato mash was cold. Which means they prepared everything way before the pork knuckle and served it cold. The pork knuckle was cooked a little too long, the meat was very dry and the skin was hard rather than crispy. I must say that it was a very disappointing wait when this is the final result of it.Well, I'll probably give them one try again (Hofbr\u00e4uhaus bier being the main reason) and hopefully the pork knuckle experience will be better and they didn't run out of the bier.",

    "text": "Interesting proposition: a Swiss-German stall in a kopitiam in Bukit Merah. It's accompanied by its neighbour, the awesome burger stall De Burg.The sausages are above average. Better than many a fancy Swiss/German bar or restaurant downtown including some more famous ones, but still a long way to go before it is as great as it can be in... well, Germany? I haven't had the pork knuckle or oxtail stew yet, which is what they are famous for. Every time I am here I eat a huge burger and then I can't move for the rest of the evening, what more eat a pork knuckle. But they also sell Archipelago beer. And any place that sells beer and pork and is in a kopitiam gets a huge thumbs up from me!",
