    "text": "Parking around here was pretty scarce. Even the carpark at 112 Katong was full!!! Bergs has a Aircon portion and an outdoor part. Of course we opted for the indoor seats! Aircon was not strong so it helped that we dressed 'cooling'. I had the Berg with Cheese and I must say the overall taste was really good. I love their mayo, I think it's made fresh from scratch as I had not tasted mayo like this before. Hubby and I noticed that the beef patties are actually rather thin and dry, if not for the awesome sauce, I can imagine the burger being lacking in taste. Not sure if I would return as there are now many burger joints who would give Bergs a run for their money.",

    "text": "A super solid burger joint! Burgers are on the greasy side, so for the dieters out there, this spot is perfect for cheat day. I've only tried two burgers here so far, only because when I find something I like, I stick with it. The brekkie burger comes with a juicy patty topped with a fried egg, and is a good one to try if you're hungover and need some fuel to get you through the dreaded morning after. My go-to is the Berg with cheese. You get to choose from edam, swiss, or blue cheese. I wish they could offer cheddar, but usually swiss gets the job done!Add $5 and you could get a side and a drink. I did this the last time I visited and ended up not being able to finish my burger. A good outcome, I guess!",

    "text": "Updating my review. I am officially hooked and torn between this place and Fat Boys Burgers. I think Bergs is slowly winning my heart. Not sure what it is. Maybe it's their special sauce (ew...you sickos...I am sure they don't do anything nasty) or how they grill/cook their burgers or toasted buns...something is quite addicting. Try The Berg when you are here and you will know what I mean. Why not 5-Stars? \u00a0After In-N-Out, how can you give 5 stars to any burger place??? \u00a0Seriously!",

The steak sandwich was drowned in sauce. The cheese wasn't even melted (that's how HOT the ciabatta was). I sent it back, and they brought me a well done steak when I had asked for medium rare at the time of ordering. I left after 2 bites. I'm never coming back here.",

As an American living in Singapore I rarely eat western food in restaurants here for two reasons: the local fare is SO good and I am accustomed to being disappointed (I wouldn't expect a good pizza here anymore than I would expect to find good laksa in the Bronx). \u00a0But after a bit of shopping today decided to indulge a craving for some comfort food so stopped by Bergs. \u00a0I had the Berg and it was really, really tasty! The quality of the beef was great and the toppings were fresh. Service was really good as well. \u00a0I will absolutely go back. \u00a0In addition, it sits in one of the most fun places to visit in the east and it was nice to sit outside (even with the light rain) as they have a nice, covered outdoor area.",
