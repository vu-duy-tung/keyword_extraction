Old wood furniture and smells from the open kitchen is something that always amazes me. Pizzas cooked in a traditional wood fire oven. And pastas made to your liking. My go-to place for Italian food.Whilst the food is good, be prepared to wait a long time to get in, the service isn't particularly good. So be prepared. But I'm sure you'll end the night pleasantly. I hope. Try it if you're around the area!",

    "text": "Al Forno definitely has a fan base, and I respect that. We stopped by during a public holiday and the restaurant was packed, so without a reservation we took a table outside.As there are a lot of Italian restaurants in the area to compare to, we chose the caprese salad to start. I went the pizza route by ordering their Pizza Al Forno (a specialty) while Migs tried one of their squid ink pastas.I wasn't too impressed with their caprese, considering it was $18. Their tomatoes were nothing to shout about, and the black olives didn't add much flavour either. I would've preferred kalamata olives instead.The Pizza Al Forno was very filling, and my takeaways fed me for 2 meals afterwards! It's halfway between a thin crust and thick crust. Toppings included mozzarella cheese, sausages, ricotta cheese, and spinach, yet I still felt that it could've had more flavour. Either a better tomato sauce, a good olive oil, or perhaps some red pepper flakes could help take it to the next level.Unfortunately service was very hurried and clearly the staff looked overwhelmed with all the guests in house. Once our food was served we could no longer get anyone's attention to deliver our check so we had to go in (twice) to get it.Not exactly the best first impression, but I'm willing to give them another try.",

I remember my fondest dates here with my then-boyfriend-now-hubby and the food is STILL as good!Focaccia Blanca - we wanted a starter and its nice. Think it as a pizza base without the sauce and ingredients. It's fragrant and goes well with soup. It's also a hit with the kids.Calamari - the squid rings are nicely battered and fried but I would have liked them seasoned more. Though the rings are tender and crispy, its a little bland for me.Pizza Alforno - our first time ordering pizza. I love how moist the pizza tasted with the feta cheese and spinach toppings!Pizza Con Carne - essentially a meaty pizza with ham slices and salami slices. Hub likes it enough.Spaghetti Cartoccio - my all-time fav baked spaghetti with seafood. They serve it in a tin foil that you cut open to reveal its goodness. The seafood is fresh and generous in amount and the spaghetti cooked till al dente even when baked. Al Forno remains my favourite Italian restaurant of homage.",

I had tagliatelle with tomato and lobster, kids had pizza, hubby had calzone, a friend of mine had meatballs penne. Everybody was happy with their meals, the portion also generous ( too much for my 13 yo kids). Mine pasta was fresh, well cooked, fresh sause also.Service was good and fast. Will definatelly return here and added this place to my list to go for dinner:)",

    "text": "We came here for our company holiday party. Thank God I didn't need to pay a single penny bc if I did, I would have written a nasty review. Well, one that might be nastier than this one. Disgusting. Seriously, I don't think anyone at our table finished any of our food. Well, except for the appetizer consisting of mozzarella + Parma ham because to create that bad version of that dish would make this restaurant an Olive Garden. Al Forno hasn't hit rock bottom like Olive Garden, but it's close. Some things that were wrong: 1. My colleague's parmesan eggplant was just soaked with cheese - which in my opinion means that it wasnt fresh. The taste test proved my suspicion to be true.2. The seafood spaghetti (their speciality) was tasteless. I had 3 bites and was fed up. My colleague gave it a tried and gave me a face after his one bite. Yuck.3. My colleague's halah order was a simple take out box. They didn't even take the time to present it nicely. Fine, fine, BUT we had to ask at least 3 times to bring her food! Muslims need to eat too! 4. The service! Ugh. We had to repeat our requests many, many times. I'm not going to get into service in Singapore, but you know what I mean. The winning grace was the pizza, which I've had much better elsewhere.There are so many other better restaurants on East Coast Road. Pass on this one. Just pass.",

And that was not because the Chef tried to make the food light or bland it's just that nothing seemed to click , it was just ok...It should have been 3 stars, the extra star is for the dessert (tiramisu) & coffee and the overall ambience since you do get the feeling of being in rustic (in a nice way) Italian tavern, but the prices btw are not of a rustic tavern!",

I suppose the food's that good cos the chef is italian himself.I'm an east coast kid so obviously I;ve been to Al Forno's countless times and everytime I'm there, the food's just as good. It really doesnt matter if you order pasta or pizza and some other main course. The food is well cooked and you're greeted by classic italian flavours in every bite.One of the starters that I particularly enjoy are the clams in white wine sauce. They weren't sandy (which is very imp) and the sauce was white wine sauce was delicious. I'd highly recommend it if you're a seafood junkie.",

Not wafer thin crispy, not overly bready - it's the right balance of crunch, chew and char. I only ever order pizza when my go to pizza maker is around - he's the Italian dude in a thin white tee, with more hair on his arms than his head. It's a wonder why the pizza oven hasn't burnt off all the hair on his arms yet. Other go to orders are the clams and spaghetti cartoccio. The pasta, served in a giant aluminum foil pack erupts a cloud of seafoody steam when opened. If that's not what dreams are made of... Wait, I take that back. That's what MY dreams are made of. I'll usually get a bottle of proseco as well, if I'm in a celebratory mood. Prices are not gentle, but not extravagantly placed either. Don't expect to be served limoncello even if you spend a bomb though; the owner only reserves it for his friends.",

When I was studying overseas, pasta was our instant noodles and so I'd never think of eating pasta at a restaurant knowing how easy it is to cook it. Yet, whenever I think of Al Forno, my mind immediately conjures up tasty memories of their seafood pasta and I almost start salivating. I don't like seafood, so I usually have just the spaghetti and sauce but the fragrant tomato-based seafood sauce is so good that we usually try to waste as little of the sauce as possible. There isn't a single portion for the seafood pasta, so you would probably have to share it if you order it. We often get it delivered especially if there are many people around. An average meal costs about $25 - $30 per person, but the food tastes deliciously home-cooked almost like it was by an 'Italian grandmother'.",

Here is where my family would turn to when everyone's too lazy to cook our dinner and we'd like to dig into some seafood and pasta. I've dine in as well as ordered home delivery and either way the food taste just as good. Home delivery is only for the houses in the east from East coast Road to Tanjong Rhu Road. What's good here and will always be ordered at every table or at least every order in my house is Spaghetti Cartoccio. It is a tomato based mixed seafood pasta with the additional touches of flavour with capers and olives. The result is a rich and flavourful sauce and a good amount of seafood. I usually will request for more spaghetti as there will always be too much sauce and ingredients left! With this and a pizza, a dinner for 4 is settled. Do take into consideration the cooking time and order early if you can. Otherwise just head down and enjoy a nice dinner out with friends!",
