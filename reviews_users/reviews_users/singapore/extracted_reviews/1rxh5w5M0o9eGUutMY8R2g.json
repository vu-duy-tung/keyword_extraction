    "text": "We were in the are and decided to visit the place for lunch. Surprisingly it was not crowded. Just a couple of tables occupied. So we had our choice of table which was one overlooking the waterfront with natural lighting. After looking through the menu, we decided on the 3-course lunch set (S$30++) which includes a choice of soft or tea/coffee. We had iced thai milk tea and iced tea with lime, which were rich and not too sweet.Chives CakesThe cakes looked and tasted like the teochew style ku chai kueh \u97ed\u83dc\u7cbf (chives steamed rice cake). The version here had pan fried to give it a crispy crust. Felt that the skin was tab too thick. Wish that there was sambal chilli sauce to go with it.Cured Pork FrittersLight and crispy on the outside, but the filling was too little to make an impression.Kanom Jin Noodle served with Mash Prawn CurryThe prawn was minced quite finely. Although the sauce tasted more on the sour side, but one soon got used to it. Served with raw greens such as bean sprouts, long beans, cucumber, and mints.Chicken Biryani Thai Style with Tomato & Herb SoupSurprisely the dish did not use the long grain rice which was usually found in biryani in Singapore. The rice was flavourful and went quite well with the sweet tomato sauce. The chicken loooked dry and charred but was quite tender.Mango and Sweet Sticky RiceThe rice was soft and chewy, although it was be better had it been served hot. Topped with the juicy sweet mango and crispy crunchy mung beans.Durian Ice Cream with Sesame WaferThe sesame wafer looked like the Beehive Cookies (Kuih Rose) \u8702\u7a9d\u997c which was usually available during festive season. It was light and crispy, which gave a savoury taste when accompanying the rich and creamy durian ice cream.Overall the food was great and the place was quite relaxing to be around.",

    "text": "Long Chim means \"come & taste\" and serves up Thai street food by celebrity Chef David Thompson. Being a frequent visitor to Thailand & a fan of both their local street & restaurant food, this was something to look forward to in Singapore. LOCATION & AMBIENCE 3.5/5Located on level 2 of Marina Bay Sands (MBS), together with a few other fine dining restaurants, Long Chim's entrance can be easily missed. Rather than at the signboard, the entrance is at a colourful stained glass wall about 30m before it. Just before the entrance, one can look down to the entire MBS casino floor with the smell of tobacco smoke wafting up. Whether it helps to whet one's appetite is subjective. The restaurant itself is bathed in the warmth of strategically located lighting mimicking inverted glass funnels, giving it an air of sophistication. After passing the bar, you are greeted by a circular dining area fronted by a \"street food cart\". At the back of the restaurant are where the food is prepared, while to the right are another row of cosy dining tables overlooking the MBS \"basin\" & foyer outside. While I was trying to take in the overall ambience, I kept thinking back to trying to figure out if this was a restaurant trying to serve street food or a street food place trying to be a restaurant. FOOD 2/5After the build up from the ambience of the restaurant, the food that was served fell far short of expectations. The steamed plain white rice was dry & clumpy, the vegetarian fried spring rolls ($13) was too salty (even with the accompanied chilli dipping sauce), the grilled long eggplant with steamed egg salad ($24) was very sour (the only thing nice from it was the steamed egg with runny yolk), the green chicken curry ($24) portion was small with just a few chicken pieces & the green curry gravy (or sauce) could have been slightly thicker & stronger taste wise. The Thai iced milk tea ($10) was good & not too sweet. We decided not to proceed to try the desserts for fear of any further disappointment. SERVICE 3.5/5The friendly staff are at hand to attend to your requests. Child seats are available on request, crayons are also provided, together with the kids menu, to be drawn on.VALUE 2.5/5People will go to any place if the food is good, be it a push cart by the street or a restaurant. Unfortunately, in this case, I do not intend to return to savour the street food there.",

    "text": "Against popular opinions, I would have to say this restaurant was not impressive at all. Set within the casino atrium and having Chef David Thompson to helm up this fine little (ok not so little) establishment, I do not think it was unreasonable to walk in with the expectations that it could be somewhat close to Nahm. Of course I wasn't expecting a Michelin star standard but..... \u00a0Their Pad Thai was too oily, most of the other dishes were average. The only memorable dishes I took away with for the night were their chive cakes (so good) and seaweed soup which kind of shows how mediocre the standard is. If I blindfolded myself, I would guess that their Tom yum soup was from Thai Express maybe (some mid class franchise across south east Asia- somewhat comparable to Panda Express in the States). Their cocktails are acceptable but nothing to scream about. Happy hour menu was Bottled chang and Leo. Asking me to have bottled beers (rather than draft) at a fancy place is just a no-no for me. Service wise was a mix of both. We had good service in the beginning but waited almost an hour for our second round of cocktails and my friend had to ask twice just for a glass of water. I know the concept behind this restaurant is just a fancy version of street food in Thailand. But there is just nothing special about this place. We paid close to S$700 for a group of 9.",

    "text": "Long Chim is a Thai restaurant opened by David Thompson, chef at the celebrated restaurant Nahm in Bangkok. \u00a0While the concept is a little different, there are some similarities with mixed results. \u00a0At Long Chim, the theme is street food, and there is a wide variety of dishes from curries and noodles to salads and stir fries. \u00a0There is a $30 version of pad thai which was flavorful but too greasy and I would say that in general the food tends to run on the oily side but also a bit saltier and sweeter as well (sounds like Thai food in the US). \u00a0There is also an option for set menu where you choose from a choice of appetizer, a set of seafood or meat mains, and a dessert. \u00a0Actually, the set menu is a nice way to explore various dishes but it is a little pricey at $69 per person. \u00a0The standouts from the set menu included the pork skewers, wagyu beef, and the watercress. \u00a0The durian ice cream still packs a punch, so I preferred the Thai tea ice cream, which was a perfect ending to the meal. \u00a0Also, they have happy hour until 8pm with a selection of $10 cocktails. \u00a0 They all run a bit sweet, but goes well with the food (the bpk is fun - flaming cocktail). \u00a0Service is solid and the servers were quite helpful. \u00a0The dining room is dark, but trendy and with a nice view of the Marina. \u00a0Overall, I enjoyed my visits here. \u00a0It's not quite Nahm, but it does work on its own level. \u00a0Food can be a bit pricey but overall spend was reasonable given happy hour prices for drinks.",

    "text": "This is the best Thai food in Singapore. Well, for most of the dishes anyway. I will get out of the way the two that I recommend avoiding: the Padthai (I know! How disappointing to have a miss on the most famous of Thai dishes) and the baked duck. The Padthai was too sweet and the noodles were overly al dente. The baked duck was nothing special. Pretty bland duck that you dip in to sauces to add flavor and the sauces are one note hits too. On to the good! The decor is sooo cool, IMO. The tiles are all imported from Thailand. Lends a Super cool vibe to the restaurant. The bathroom is pretty unique too. You'll just have to go check it out for yourself to see what I mean.The pork and rice cake appetiser is a must try! But you have to love spicy food. It's one of those dishes that takes you on a rollercoaster of regret, acceptance, love and repeat. The heat is intense to say the least. The fried tiger shrimp were simply delicious. Cooked to perfection with a mildly sweet and slightly tangy flavor.They sometimes do an in-house durian ice cream that tasted like a durian fluffy sugar/milk cloud. And the banana roti cake is a religious experience. (Side note, the first time I had it there they kind of burned it a little and I hated it. The subsequent times it has been cooked to perfection.)Definitely give them a try if you're at mbs and jonesing for some yummy ( but expensive) Thai food.",

Leave room for the durian ice cream. The main negative about this place is that it is extraordinarily overpriced.",

Big surprise here is the amazing bar staff who will create anything you desire, just tell them what you feel like. In terms of the food, expect BIG flavours here, much, much bigger than standard restaurants. You have to try the Chiang Mai Larp starter. My goodness. This little number will blow your head off. Once you get past the Chilli, the taste is phenomenal. It's a roller coaster of death with a pleasant finish (i.e still being alive). If you ask, they occasionally have Beef Massaman, but it's not on the menu. Staples like Pad Thai, Wagyu Beef Skewers are also not to be missed. We love this place and have been about four times. Great with kids, better without. Will be back again soon.",

We especially enjoyed our starter which is:Prawn cakesMains of:Grilled fish, vermicelli with baked prawns, mashed prawn curry & green beef curryAccording to my friend, Thompson's food is an old-school version of Thai food that does not appeal to the young, more modern Thai palate. \u00a0Old school or not, what his team (Thompson does not cook here) are doing at Long Chim is top-notch, and at these prices (around $10 for entrees and $20 and upwards for shared mains), one could hardly do better.Anyway, I think Long Chim is a great addition to Singapore's restaurant scene. \u00a0Thai food in Singapore generally has a bad rep, which I suspect is largely to do with the inability to source the super-fresh produce and other ingredients which make Thai cuisine such a joy. \u00a0Long Chim has made a genuinely impressive start and I hope it will set a new bar for Thai cuisine here.",

    "text": "This place is yet another in the trend of celebrity chef restaurants. The great chef of the hour in this instance is David Thompson, who is an Aussie chef famous for his take on Thai cuisine. He has a couple of restaurants in Sydney, and Nahm is his Michelin star restaurant in Bangkok. With a resume like that, we were expecting a really impressive evening.Location: On the waterfront area, in the Casino/Mall complex. Great location because you can walk around the park before or after dinner, see the Supertree grove by night, and you'll have a decent view of the Marina Bay during your meal, depending on your table.Decor/ambience: The place has really beautiful design details in the color scheme, tiles, light fixtures, etc. But it feels mass-manufactured and inauthentic. Like a chain restaurant. Oh wait, it basically is a chain restaurant.Drinks: We had a couple of cocktails each. They are low on alcohol and *very* high on sugar. Despite the interesting ingredients, there's no real craftsmanship in these cocktails.Food: We did the set menu, which is just a selection of items from the regular menu. The chef selects items for your table. I was disappointed with the food because the flavors oscillated between bland and blow-out-your-palate spicy. That being said, we had a couple of starters that were nice, and the mango sticky rice dessert was the best I've ever had.Overall, there was absolutely nothing going on here that isn't done better (and significantly cheaper) at a food stall. The problem with celebrity chef restaurants is that, well, they have the name of the chef but not the chef him/herself.",
