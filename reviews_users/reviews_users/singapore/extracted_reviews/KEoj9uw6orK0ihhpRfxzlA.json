Luckily there's space and they're opened till 10pm. It's expensive wanting to sit here and look cool.. I gave the coffee a miss because I'm not shelling out 9 bucks for coffee I'm unsure of. The food is good.. Expensive but...you are paying for location to be seen. And it isn't that bad.. The food I mean. Had the papardalle pasta ($24)with slow roasted beef cheeks, stewed in a ragout style and little kales and mushrooms. The atmosphere is seen to be seen and somebody needs to tell them they need to equalize their music.. Too dang sharp to hang out there now :( They offer lots of variety in snacks and coffee. Would I come back? Nah.. Not really. To hang out with friends yeah I could.",

The lighting is a cool soft-hue but sufficient and the shelves have a neat organized array of stuff.I had a quest of looking for different chai to try around the island and I was able to check this one off of my very non-solid list, lol. It was mentioned that it's made in-house so those are always curious to me... It was a nice chai latte and also had nice presentation from the simple art and the popsicle stick laid on top with some sort of spice dashed on it for taste (cinnamon, nutmeg... not sure, could also be the chai powder). Whatever it was, I just dumped it in, stirred it up and drank it. Perhaps like anything with powder, it's best enjoyed warm and regularly stirred, 'else you swallow clumps waiting for you at the end. ;) Anywho, this was a nice subtle--if not lacking--chai latte. I probably should've checked about cinnamon and nutmeg [and sugar], which I always enjoy mixed in.Staff was good and felt welcoming.The chairs at the window bar, where I sat, are sort of neat molded wood stool types. The backrest has a height adjustment but the wing nut screwed on wanted Hulk strength to loosen... ;/ These types of wood chairs are SO comfy with the right setting.",

    "text": "Sunday brunch, the holy grail of the weekends. If you're looking for a well-located place, this is it! Ride the escalator located outside of Mandarin Gallery (on the side nearer to H&M) and you're magically transported right to The Providore's doorstep. Definitely magical because once you step through those doors, you leave the humidity of Singapore's weather outside - which was what we were looking for on a really sunny and warm Sunday afternoon. We were quickly seated as there was no queue and relatively little patrons when we arrived - there was a queue when we left, so my advice is to really get there a little earlier though the accepted is a late Sunday brunch. All I have to say is the early bird catches the worm! Service was quick as well - we ordered drinks first, and subsequently they actually came round thrice to ask if we were ready to order food! Iced Latte as usual for me, while the partner had a Musk Earl Grey Tea. The iced latte was nothing to shout about, it's just habit that I have my morning coffee. The musk earl grey tea smelt divine and tasted great as well - earl grey tea served with slices of citrus (lime, lemon and orange slices to be exact). After much deliberation, I ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese - it was yummy, but overall a disappointment. While the lobster and pasta tasted great in the cheese sauce, it was cheese sauce. My standards of great mac and cheese start and end with the macaroni being engulfed in gooey cheesy goodness. This one lacked that, the cream sauce was thin with a hint of blue cheese - a more creamy rather than cheesy version of what would've been perfect because the sauce really tasted awesome. The partner had the Ham and Cheese Toastie, which was totally awesome - made me regret not ordering the steak sandwich instead because of a ham and cheese could be elevated like that, I would really loved to have tried what they could do with steak and bread. Unfortunately, we probably will not be back here unless a twist of fate brings us back to The Providore - he found this place for brunch at 3am in the morning through Google and glad to say, he decided on his dish based on photos posted by fellow Yelpers! Overall, it was a good experience with speedy service but I wouldn't be back here again for brunch - maybe to buy alcohol as they have a selection of wines and spirits that aren't frequently seen around.",

The Roasted New Potatoes with Rosemary and Romesco Sauce was well sauteed and roasted to perfection, its enough to be eaten on its own. Have it, however, with the Romesco sauce for a mild spicy and tangy taste. The Spatchcock Chicken is a chicken that had their backbone removed so that it can be flattened before roasting it with lemon & thyme, garlic & shallots, verjus & Creme Fraiche sauce. This resulted in a crispy skin and each piece of chicken tasting juicy and flavourful. It is one that must be ordered here! The Red Velvet Cake had disappointed a bit. The cake did not crumble easily, the taste of the cake were alright, but the taste of butter/cheese was in near absence in the cream used. Nonetheless, the quantity was enough to delight both of us.",

After taking our order with relatively few hiccups the poor and unbelievable service started. The table next to us waited and hour for drinks which never came. As we sipped our coffee for the first hour I decided to check on the status of our food. A very wonderful server (I think named Edward who can def find a better place to work with his warm character) asked if we would still like our food as there had been a problem in the kitchen. He went to get the manager at my request as he checked the timing of our order. The manager first refused to speak to me because he was busy. Then informed me it was my problem because I came at a busy time. When I said it had been an hour and I had seen other tables turn over multiple times he yelled \"well if you want your food I need to go work\". When the food did arrive one dish was over cooked, one was undercooked and there were egg shells in the eggs. I asked for the manager and he yelled \"what do you want?\" \u00a0I asked for the card to his supervisor and he yelled fine. Edward tried to apologize as the manager stormed off. We did not stay to eat eggshells....",
