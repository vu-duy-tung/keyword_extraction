    "text": "Soon Heng RojakHDB HubToa PayohI was number 15 in the queue.25 Minutes before I received 2 packets (sauce packed separately) and 1 plate for me.It is too sweet. Told the woman taking the orders but unfortunately talking to her is like talking to a wall so one can't be sure if she heard or not. She heard that I didn't want turnip and taupok but not the less sugar part. It was still cloyingly sweet. So sometimes she hears and sometimes she doesn't. Don't bother repeating because she wouldn't answer anyway. So irritating. I like the rojak except that it's too sweet.The takeaway packets came with sauce separated (you must make a request).Verdict: Not as good as Hoover Rojak (Whampoa Market) when the old man was still around but is better than his son's.",

I was swiftly able to get my hands on the famous rojak.At 4 bucks, I got a large serving of cucumber, benkoang, juicy pineapple, tau gay, puffy taupok and crispy you tiau doused with a delicious sticky sweet sauce and celebrated with nuts all round. It is a sumptuous side to my main and also a little too much for two, hence I overate .",

The auntie preparing the Rojak seemed to just throw everything into the mixing bowl, but you'll be amazed how she got all the proportions right. I love how the cuttlefish compliment this Rojak. No wonder there's one plate of Rojak on almost every other table, and the long queue at the store during lunch time. Will Rojak be the next Singaporean dish that Gordon Ramsay will challenge? ;)",

(no, im not exaggerating. )this is probably one of the last places where you can get a bang for your buck, 2,50 SGD yields a decent portion, tell me if you can find another stall that serves the same amount or more for the same price- it's rare. my advice? go for the 4sgd size. extra chilli. you wont regret it.",
