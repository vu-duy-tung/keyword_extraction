I really like the lobster tails starters, and everything was generally good. The prime rib was so juicy and large, I felt so guilty eating one by myself, which I nevertheless shamelessly finished.I do like this place, and liked my window seat! I do feel a little funny that my friend's vegetables on his steak were skewered on little forks suspended over his plate. I also feel a little funny that this place has a lot of pomp. Good place to impress a girl, I spose. (haha) Decent food.Oh, we also had the house-branded wine, which was okay as far as generic wines go.",

    "text": "A cut above the rest.Lawry's The Prime Rib, what more can be said about it. Since opening its doors in 1999, Lawry's has been THE go to place for prime ribs in Singapore. With its English style setting (ironic considering the restaurant started in Beverly Hills), it's wait staff dressed immaculately and of course, it's iconic silver cart, Lawry's has attracted thousands, maybe millions, of hungry carnivores looking to get a dosage of their prized, USDA, 21 day aged Prime ribs. However, with tons of Steak houses like Wolfgang Puck's Cut, the much more affordable Aston's and the rise of restaurants like The Prime Society and independent restaurant's like Cocotte, \u00a0the question remains..... Is Lawry's really still a cut above the rest? If you're looking for a good generous slice of meat done different from anywhere else than... Yes. We've seen how steaks are done at most restaurants. In a pan, on a grill, all beautifully seasoned and seared off in perfect 200g cuts of sirloin or ribeye but till date, no one quite does it like Lawry's (at least i don't think so). The menu at Lawry's (lunch menu) is fairly simple. No 50 item menu, just a few selections for each course, but be warned, their prime rib lunch which comes with a salad, mash and Yorkshire pudding is more than enough for a meal. This round however, we decided to go for the Festive cut. 220g of their renown prime rib, served with an additional side. We did however thought we'd give their appetizer a shot since it was only for a $19++ top up. Pan Seared Hokkaido Scallop and Shrimp. This was a very beautifully presented plate. Very different from the one you'll get with your ribs. However, sad to say, the presentation was more beautiful than the dish itself. The Shrimp was over cooked and slightly on the rubbery side while the scallop, which was nicely cooked, was very \"stringy\" (apologies for the lack of a better word). It was hard to cut through and chew and while you could tell it was cooked well, the knife somehow wouldn't slice through smoothly as you'd expect when eating scallops. What bothered me most about the dish though was the mango salsa that came with it. While it was a mango and strawberry salsa, it was very very sweet. The mango had cancelled out all forms of acidity from the strawberry and what you were left with was a salsa that was neither vibrant or complimented the seafood above it very well. So much so that all natural sweetness that should have be showcased by the prawns and scallops, was lost in the salsa.Signature Spinning Bowl SaladWell.... I've honestly had better salads. While it's a decent salad, it certainly didn't blow my mind and really tasted... Well... Rather ordinary. Plus point? The croutons are great! Festive Cut Prime RibsThere's no doubt in my mind that the quality of the meat has changed. While it's still delicious and tender, the meat wasn't as melt in your mouth tender as it was when I first tried it a few years ago. The vast difference in the tenderness between a medium and medium rare was very obvious. That said, it was still a good piece of meat to have. While the meat was good, the sides that it came with sort of bothered me. Mashed Potatoes, a little too starchy and heavy for my liking. Buttered Peas (for myself)As good as buttered peas can get. Peas were decently sweet and nice buttered. Creamed Spinach (for the Gf)Very thick and very rich, just the way spinach should be done. However, flavour? A little flat. You get a heavy dose of cream but don't get any depth in flavour, be it salt or a tinge of acidity to balance it out. Yorkshire PuddingPlus Point? It's HUGE! But, that's about it. Having spent most of my holidays in England thanks to having family there, I've spent my entire childhood enjoying restaurant and home made Yorkshire pudding. However, this Yorkshire pudding sort of misses the spot for me. My aunt uses lard to coat the strays to ensure it crisps without burning but there was that prominent burnt taste in the puddings here. While the overall texture is still nice, the flavour just misses the mark for me (maybe it's because I've been spoiled by the original home made versions). Overall, this is a very tough call for me to make. I still rate the meat a 5 but some of the other dishes didn't quite hit the mark for me. Will still give the restaurant a 4 because of the ambience, the meat, the showmanship. The only qualm I have is, whether Lawry's needs to modernize. While the meat is still good, the way it's served on a plate and the overall feel of the restaurant does somehow feel comfortable yet dated, if that makes any sense.",

    "text": "It took me a while, a long while, before I finally tried Lawry's. It has always been on my list but somehow I never made it there till recently for its 15th Anniversary celebration. A friend was enamored with the special dinner menu and as he was leaving Singapore soon, we made it a leaving do. I think many people dine at Lawry's for special occasion as the pricing is a bit on the high side. There were a few birthday celebrations when we were there. We were also given a complimentary slice of cake together with picture taking (print given on the spot with the soft copy being emailed a few days later) as I mentioned it was a farewell dinner. That was really nice and a good way to remember the occasion.The dinner set menu includes - King Salmon Gravlax- Spinning Bowl Salad- Hokkaido Scallop Vol-Au-Vent- Roasted Prime Beef Ribs - Chocolate SurpriseI liked how the salad was served with a chilled salad fork. The coolness made the salad very refreshing even though the veggies were quite ordinary.The beef was medium and fabulously pink. I had the creamed spinach which was nice but not mind blowing. The yorkshire pudding was fantastic, fluffy inside and crisp outside. I believed they made it right before serving it. The dessert was good too. The salmon and scallop were nice but not that memorable. I would go back just for the prime ribs. That is after all their specialty. The place has a lush yet cozy feel. A bit of the old world charm with its wood paneling and carpet. It is not so intimidating quiet that you feel strange talking nor is it very noisy that you feel like you are in a fish market. It is indeed a fine place for a special occasion.",

The Service, with waitstaff (female) in chambermaid outfits acted as professional, and really outdid the waiters. The staff attentively, served us, replaced our silverware, and served our plates correctly (served on the left). Every dining need was taken care of by the staff.The Food: A wonderful little show by the staff who spin your salad in a giant bowl, almost in front of you, was entertaining. Though we didn't eat the main course of steak, the white cod fish was cooked to perfection, the additional lobster we ordered was grilled perfectly, as well. The side dishes like mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding tasted great, too. Our dessert (creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and pecan brownie) were perfect, and our host ordered a third dessert, for us to share, a NY styled marble cheesecake, which tasted like home.When in Singapore, stop by Lawry's for a great meal!",

    "text": "This place is full of comic factors. It's like dining in a theme park. For reals. Me and the missus walked past the restaurant and I made the casual comment about the fact that I've never tried this restaurant before and then we decided to check out the menu and vibes. The fact that it looks straight out of the 80s was probably the sole comic factor that lured us in. We thought it would be funny. It turned out to be hilarious indeed, and then a little sad. Almost fell off my chair as soon as we were seated, when I saw how they dressed their waitresses in chambermaid uniforms. I mean.. Seriously??!!! Surely it's against some HR policy or Moral and Ethics Code of the restaurant association?!! It was both funny and sad at the same time. We ordered roast beef and steak. It comes with salad. But they didn't tell us that the salad comes with the chambermaid preparing it in front of you with a little dance number. I mean... It's intense. Me and the missus had to channel all our willpower to stop ourselves from laughing out loud. It was hard. Surely this restaurant belongs in Disneyland or something. Surely. The food? It felt like food that you get in a Hard Rock Hotel, or on a cruise. Which to be honest is super aligned and on brand to the vibes of this place. So you can say it's authentic and brand consistent cuts across all touch points. Only problem is that they position themselves as a premium prime rib place, and at a price point to match. They should completely target the cruise dining scene. They'll be big.",

For Singaporean appetites, English Cut is adequate unless you're a carnivore who craves more meat. The \"performance\" of food preparation and faux \"english dining room\" decor is the novelty here, where the waitresses are dressed in tacky uniforms, they spin and toss your salad in a large metal bowl, and a guy dressed as a \"chef\" with a fake medal hung around his neck rolls the prime rib out to your table and carves your serving of meat infront of you. Service staff are well trained and very attentive.I've tasted salads better elsewhere, and the \"special\" seasoned salt is the same thing stocked on the shelves at the grocery for US$1.99. The USDA Prime Rib is decently good, but not mind-blowingly amazing.Unfortunately, Lawrys is extremely pricey here, and I have no idea why. The meat is good, as in US$40 good, but not SGD$120 good. You're better off stepping into Lawrys in Vegas or LA instead.",

    "text": "LOVE THIS SO MUCH. You will find many places in Singapore and all around the world professing to do the 'best steak ever' (hello Hawksmoor), but I have found no where to be as reliable as this in serving up a quality cut. Admittedly, I have only ever had the Lawry's Cut, but that's mostly because I have never found any reasons to get anything else. The Lawry's Cut comes with a side of salad in a spinning bowl, which is as much a highlight for me as the steak itself. The whole meal is served to you via a little cart, even the salad, and it never ceases to fascinate me how that spinning mechanism can be so simple, yet so elegant, and then mix the salad so perfectly. The croutons are as crunchy as you would want it to be. Best salad ever. Following the salad, prepare for the most glorious cart of meat to be pushed in, and choose wisely. Have it medium-rare, or medium at most. I have decided as a personal guideline that the more expensive the steak, the more rare I should have it (without going to extremes), reason being that fancy places tend to take pride in the freshness of the meat, so you want to be able to taste as much of that as you can get. The serving is sizable - even for the meat lover I am, this plate was a challenge to clean up - and the meat practically melts in your mouth. This finest specimen will come accompanied by the smoothest Idadho mash and a wonderfully prepared Yorkshire pudding to cap off a terrifically English feel to the experience. Worth every single penny.",

The boyfriend and I have been walking past it when it was in Paragon going \"One fine day, we shall come here and eat.\" True enough, we eventually did go there and eat on our anniversary. Firstly, the ambiance of the place is classy. We got a seat by the window side which was lovely. Our first course was the spinning salad, which was supposedly their signature dish. A waitress dressed in a maid outfit rolls a trolley to the side of your table and does a sad little dance while spinning the salad bowl in ice and tossed the salad. I personally feel, other than that dance.. there is nothing quite special about the salad. Our main course came soon after, the chef rolled a trolley to our table and slices the beef in front of you. Cream spinach, corn and mash potatoes were served on the side. Yorkshire Pudding was also served for you to eat it with the gravy. So here's the verdict, the beef was ok. But the Yorkshire Pudding was lovely! I had like two servings of that because it was good. I am not a big fan of greens but at Lawry's I surprised myself by finishing all the cream spinach. All in all, Lawry's is lovely for the ambiance, great service and well.. alright food. It is worth a visit at least once in a blue moon.",

    "text": "Easily one of the best steakhouses in Singapore , \u00a0Lawry's the Prime Rib is the to-go place should you crave meat and want to impress your client or date. That's if cash isn't an issue. While it may be pricey, I've never been disappointed once considering the number of times I've been there. The service remains impeccable as always and while there's a slight change in decor ever since they shifted over to Mandarin Gallery, the food remains spot on. Newcomers to Lawry's should give their signature Prime Rib Dinner set a go and request for the Lawry's Cut (250g of the most popular cut). But please remember, if you're going to have steak, make sure you have it at least medium-rare, or you won't get to enjoy the lovely steaks as they should be!",

    "text": "Very nice ambience. Great service. Food is good. Roast beef is sliced according to your preference. Medium should be the most cooked you should request. \u00a0Beef could be a little more tender. Suppose to be USDA Prime and aged, but I have had better. Nonetheless the flavor was excellent. For starters we had the crab cake. Good but then in have had the best in Chicago. So could have had less filler. Crust a little hard, but I'm being picky. The brownie desert was very good. I'd pass on the trifle. No flavor of rum at all. \u00a0Price is on the high side. Overall a very nice experience and would return for a special occasion or with a special someone.",
