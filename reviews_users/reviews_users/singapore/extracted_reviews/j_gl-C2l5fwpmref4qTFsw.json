    "text": "Decided to grab an easy lunch at Crossroad Caf\u00e9 today. Entrance to the caf\u00e9 is located along Scotts Road (not inside the hotel). I have been to Crossroads many many years ago, it looked different then. I am sure it has gone through renovations and upgrade since. If anyone is worried the caf\u00e9 would be too hot for comfort, there is no need to fear. There were huge ceiling fans and in fact it was really comfortable dining there. Trust me on that since I am always so scared of places which have no air conditioning in Singapore. FOOD 5/5Char Kway Teow - This is a local dish which comprised of flat wide noodles with eggs, vegetables, fish cake, huge prawns and squids. I know the locals may cry foul with anyone eating a local street food at a 5 star hotel with 5 star pricing. I beg to differ. The portion of my Char Kway Teow was huge, the ingredients were fresh and the caf\u00e9 was generous with the prawns. Mmmmm... Yummy!Lychee Iced Tea - I never have a Lychee Iced Tea. Very refreshing!! I really like it :) AMBIENCE 5/5Despite the caf\u00e9 not being enclosed, it was not warm. There were huge ceiling fans mounted and it was rather breezy siting under the fan. It was like me sitting in a resort restaurant except we were in the middle of the bustling Orchard Road area. This is probably the best caf\u00e9 in Orchard area for people watching. I have no interest in people watch, I only like to look at the food I am eating, lol!!SERVICE 4/5The staffs were nice. Service was what I expected from a 5 star hotel like Marriott. Took a while to holler down a staff to get my check at the end of lunch though. Also, the bread should come before the meal and not together. Hence, the one star off. Overall, Crossroads is a great place for a nice, relaxing lunch. Bonus for people who like to people watch.",

I had a BLT.... how to you mess that up?! It has 3 main ingredients between two slices of bread... food was not fresh... bread, lettuce, tomato wilted and stale. And the bacon had a not so fresh flavor to it. Everything was cold. They completely forgot about my husbands food with no apologies. The rest of the party was finished eating by the time his food came. We confronted the manager a dark skinned man with zero management skill, he just hovered over us, mumbled something.... sorta argued back a little as we signed our credit card slips. He was not managing this place, many people we getting annoyed at the service and he just stood behind the podium like we was gearing up to give a speech. He was managing absolutely nothing. Did not ask us how out food was, but asked us for our money. Great service starts from the top and he sets the bar pretty low. I was going to give this place 2 stars until we interacted with the manager... promptly removed a star with enthusiasm.",

Roughly $18-22 per cocktail. The vibe is good, but it does get quite stuffy and hot ever now and then.After a few cocktails, stumble into Tang's for some shopping. Just don't shop for shoes bc you (or rather me!) will trip and fall. \u00a0Tip: Tell the server before ordering that you're planning to share! You're not supposed to, but sometimes they'll close one eye and grant you that favor ;))",

    "text": "Upon walking past Crossroads Cafe one morning I noticed a sign offering a discounted breakfast buffet for guests who were willing to sit outside. S$32++ was the price - still not cheap but better than the S$50++ it would have cost by sitting inside. Let me start with the positive. The selection is absolutely amazing. If you can't find anything to eat, then we need to have a different discussion. Their cappuccinos are from Illy - their beans are of a high standard and drinking coffee becomes an instant pleasure. As for the issues. Everything has sugar in it and is made extra sweet (roti prata, yoghurt, bircher m\u00fcsli, etc.) - aspartame-laced, perhaps. Not the best for you or your body. In addition, they use genetically modified (GM) oils to cook their dishes. When their omelette Chef started taking the canola oil can to spray on my eggs, I almost lost it. I tend to (try and) reeducate people on the risks of these GM foods, yet the Chef tried to convince me that it was indeed healthy (does that mean everything is booked with Canola Oil??). The scenario turned somewhat comical when the caucasian Chef - overhearing our conversation - sprinted over to the station and immediately confirmed that the dish could of course be made just as I requested. So I am happy to report that they understand the risks but I guess in order to maximize their contribution margins and minimize food cost, they look the other way. If you don't care for your health for at least one day a week, eat here!",

Average. People watching: excellent.Eating: was looking for something quick and easy on my last night in SG. Scanned the menu and saw NZ Wagyu Ribeye for S$70. I was interested! Ordered medium and got a nice medium with nice grill marks, about 20mm thick. Was the juiciest steak I have ever eaten, including other Wagyu! Every bite was juicy and rich. The Chilean Cabernet whose name I have forgotten was a pricey (S$25/glass) but good accompaniment. The frites were standard, thin cut 5mm square fries. Such a great piece of meat deserves thicker, hand cut fries. Next time I am in SG and have a hankering for steak, I will come back here.",
