Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but at lunch only pasta, paninis and salads are available. Mains (a limited list) are served from 3 pm - for what kind of client\u00e8le?",

I was there on a Sunday afternoon and it was pleasantly quiet. The ambiance is relaxing and there's ample seats. Flat white was not bad. The enoki fries was a tad oily.Didn't try anything else on the menu. They had quite a selection of cakes on display too but I was too full for anything.I'd go back if I happen to be around the area.",

    "text": "I don't agree with the other reviewers so 1 star to make the reviews here on Yelp seem legit. I went a few months ago, and I thought the service was not amazing, and food was horrible. In my opinion.My friend ordered salad with chicken and she said the chicken was way too dry and forced herself to eat the salad. I had a pasta with meat and tomato sauce and I just couldn't eat any of it. It felt to me like they just microwaved meat and hence the tough meat, and pasta was not fresh it was just not up to the standard that I was expecting. I also ordered a coffee but nothing beat ronin or punch in that neighborhood in my opinion. Therefore I haven't gone back ever since.I'm writing this review because I am looking for other cafes and restaurants nearby this neighborhood since I just moved here. But to see this place on top of Ronin made me think the reviews are not legitimate, especially with only 3 other reviews. So let's be real. It may be good enough for locals, but as an Asian who was born and raised abroad, I personally don't like it, but give it one try, as I did, and decide for yourself.",
