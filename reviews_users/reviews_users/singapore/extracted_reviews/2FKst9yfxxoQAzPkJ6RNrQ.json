    "text": "I haven't been to People's Park in some time so the mall took me by surprise while I was tying to find my way up to Lepark - hodgepodge of businesses from travel agencies to massage parlours...Like some have mentioned, you have to take the lift to the 5th floor and walk up a flight of dingy looking stairs to get to Lepark. What wasn't mentioned was that the lifts shutdown at midnight and the main door out is locked. It took us some time to find our way out - guess we should ask the Lepark staff the best way to get out the next time. Lepark offers a good selection of beers and ciders, and only 3 bottles of wine - 2 white, 1 red so you know which poison to choose. The guy behind the counter was very friendly and offered good recommendations. Food selection is varied as well. I really enjoy the laid back vibe of the place and it wasn't crowded on a Saturday night. Perfect. We only had the truffle fries which was mediocre so we'll be back to sample more.",

I was sort of expecting good beer company but at least the venue is cool. Honestly the food wasn't good. Some of it was really bad.",

    "text": "I came for late lunch on a Saturday. \u00a0I was famished and happy to see that the place wasn't so busy. I was curious about Lepark after seeing other reviews here. I ordered salted egg yolk soft shell crab sliders, plum sweet potato fries and a lemonade. Total cost 30 dollars. I love all things with salted egg yolk, sweet potato, and soft shell crab and fried stuff. But this meal was really disappointing. The soft shell crab was not warm and tasted like it was fried in old oil. The sweet potato fries were just so-so, and for 10 dollars, not worth it. I'm sticking to my favorite shilin for my fix of sweet potato plum fries. The slider portion was good, enough to share if you're not very hungry. I was very hungry but struggled and forced myself to finish it and not gag from the oily taste. Hours after the meal I could still taste the oily fried aftertaste and had uncomfortable indigestion the whole night. Not coming back here though I guess if you just want the vibe, you could go for drinks.",

    "text": "Lepark, the name says it all. It's a place to lepak, which I was told means chilling, doing nothing, loitering in Malay. \u00a0It's also at \"le parc\" or \"the park\" coz it's right on the rooftop carpark of People's Park Complex. \u00a0Ok, perhaps a bit too much on the pun but next time you are tired around Chinatown, you know there's a hipster sanctuary right on top of the buzz. \u00a0And guess where? It's right on top of People's Park, above all the steamy Chinese snacks and mainland migrant workers. \u00a0For $10 - $15 you get a craft beer or a cocktail, there is also a number of finger foods to choose from. \u00a0Best of all is the live music. \u00a0The past weekend was their soft-opening and the place attracted a healthy crowd. \u00a0I have to admit it was quite a fun experience listening to country while gazing at the Chinatown landscape and the People's Park rooftop. \u00a0There were also a bunch of people practising yoga outside. \u00a0Guess the hipsters are invading China town? \u00a0To get there, go into People's Park Complex and find the elevators in the mall, go to the 5th floor, turn right on exiting, go through the wooden door to the stairs and go up to the rooftop. \u00a0If you have time, go explore the mall in the People's Park Complex, it's a market place in there!",

You'll get a great view of the Central Business District if you walk out the caf\u00e9, especially in the evenings at dawn.It's a pretty surreal place too. Right atop People's Park Complex - where your mum would shop for tour packages at a travel agency, do cheap manicure, or change money.",

They had asahi and another german beer on tap. What was awesome were the numerous bottled craft beer going from $10 to $12. There was finger food sold too and groups of people gathered in the dining indoors with their coteries of friends (old and new) making for a very lively atmosphere.At the open space outside, people were enjoying the breeze, puffing on their cigarettes, beer bottle/cups in hand, watching a black-and-white screening of an old cantonese movie. When that ended, the swarm congregated around the stage area swaying to beats of a rock band and also to a female vocalist.The event could not end without a rendition of 'Stun by Vegetable' song.All in all, good fun to hang out with buddies on a Saturday night",
