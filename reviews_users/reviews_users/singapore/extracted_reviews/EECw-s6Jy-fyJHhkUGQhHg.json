Times like this, I really feel the urge to hug the chef and thank him or her for doing things so impeccably awesome.the lemon tart wasn't overly acidic and had a sweet sour curd that brought a high end to my meal",

It serves freshly baked produce like croissants, tarts, pies, breads and \u00e9clairs. For those who hate mornings but enjoy breakfast, Paul's Bakery has all day breakfasts too, among other savory bites. The usual teas and coffees are also available to accompany your meal.The price can be on the steep side, so do be prepared to fork out a hefty sum, if you plan on having a feast.",

    "text": "My friend hates it that I affectionately call it LAO PAUL. She thinks it's undeserving of one of the most famous bakeries in Paris. Sigh. How else to express my love?If you've been to Ngee Ann City in the past few months, or have frequented Kinokuniya, Paul is impossible to miss. The eye-catching artisan decor stands out from the modern lines of Takashimaya. According to their spokesperson, \"Everything from the breads to the decor is authentic to the standards set in other Paul bakeries worldwide.\"The food was reasonably tasty, most of their pastries (Millefeuille nature especially) were crusty and not overly sweet. I liked their mini macaroons, so *powerpuff* and noms. If you like pastries with a tinge of sourness, try the fruit tarts. Price is a little steep but within expectations. There are promotional sets such as ALL-DAY-BREAKFAST sets, baker's basket; mostly priced below $10 to make it worth your while. I've been there a few times, service has been good. Once, there was an enthusiastic waiter whom we inquired with on closing hours.Him: It's 10 officially but we stay on till the last customer leaves.Me: What if the customer doesn't leave?! Him: We have our methods.LOL.It's easy to emulate the tai-tai life sitting at Paul's, sipping on chamomile tea. Pretty nice respite in the middle of Orchard Road.",

    "text": "I hope they'll work to improve the quality of service. \u00a0After seeing long queues on previous visits to the mall, we were happy to be seated immediately. \u00a0As other reviewers have noted, the service here is spotty. \u00a0My friend and I each ordered an entree. \u00a0His Salade Nicoise arrived immediately but there was an additional 12 min wait for my Tartine Boeuf to be delivered. \u00a0This type of delay is a common problem in lower quality Singapore restaurants and there's no excuse for it other than managers who do not train their staffs to western standards. \u00a0In western cultures, it's rude to begin eating until everyone has been served. \u00a0All western style restaurants in Singapore need to institute a system in which no entrees are delivered to a table until all entrees are ready in the kitchen. \u00a0 Then all entrees are delivered at the same time. \u00a0This is not a difficult system to implement.This is the result of service by committee when one waiter is not assigned to a table. \u00a0The committee of servers are not insuring the overall guest experience - instead they are blindly taking orders and then delivering the food when it appears in the kitchen window. \u00a0No one takes ownership of the table.While waiting for my food, servers tried to give me 3 other entrees which belonged to nearby tables. \u00a0US restaurants use a numbering system that assigns each table and seat a number. \u00a0 When the item leaves the kitchen the server knows to precisely deliver it to Table 12, Position 2. \u00a0This eliminates the need for the waiter to \"auction\" the plate at the table. \u00a0For me, this is the clear separating line between the amateurs and the professionally run restaurants.My Tartine Boeuf was delicious, but I can't make sense of the $7.50 lemon ice tea that was nothing special. \u00a0Usually when you pay so much for an iced tea, there is a simple syrup offered for sweetening. \u00a0My friend says his Salade Nicoise was bland with not enough dressing. \u00a0(I had 12 minutes to look at it and it looked bland) The Good: \u00a0My Tartine Boef was delicious. \u00a0The two take away bakery items (chocolate torte and elclair) were also good.The Bad: \u00a01. Servers who don't know the correct pronunciations of the french dishes, 2. A system that does not guarantee that all entrees are delivered to a table at the same time. \u00a0Of course a salad takes less time to prepare. \u00a0Don't deliver it until the longer prep items are ready. \u00a0Managers - this is not rocket science!!3 Servers who \"auction\" the wrong entrees to you unsure of who the food belongs to. \u00a0Again, this is easily resolved with a numbering system - using both the table and seat number. \u00a0An international clientele in a restaurant that offers a supposedly \"upscale\" experience deserves better.4. Some tables are so close together that you feel like you're dining with strangers.5.Bland salad, $7.50 iced tea??!! \u00a0No syrup.Total for 2 entrees and 2 beverages: $60+The Verdict: The 10 min+ wait between entrees being delivered is the deal breaker. The prices are too high for such amateur service. \u00a0Will not be returning",

    "text": "Have you been caught in the \"waiting\" glitch? And when I mentioned Paul Bakery, what is the first thing that comes to mind? Nope, not the fresh loaves loved by some, nor the bewitching patisseries they offer. It is the less celebrated service standards experienced by many. Not sure if I was in luck, I have had enjoyed good hospitality which I have reviewed earlier. While many were overjoyed at its opening, Paul was plagued by unhappy voices. They have been drawing big crowds since the day they opened, which I have never doubt. Despite the lapsed in service, I am still seeing people making beeline at its entrance after peak hours. The main dining hall was bustling with high tea enthusiasts - conversations echoing the room. J suggested we take one of the tables outside the restaurant for a quieter time, much to what I agreed. We managed to get one with the help of a waiter - polite (checked). Without spilt seconds, another waiter came with 2 sets of menu and giving us ample time to decide (checked).I hold the menu in my hand with great anticipation. Unmistakably, it was given a face-lift with a range of newer creation - still the French classics but now, some with a local twist. New faces includes specialty sandwiches: Pan Bagnat Club (S$16.90); open sandwiches: Salade Crevettes Mangue (S$19.90), Croque Truffade (S$19.90) - a simple toast topped with cheddar cheese, B\u00e9chamel sauce, truffles & mushrooms which most suits anyone with a less complicated desire. Then comes the Haute dishes: Hachis Parmentier (S$23.90) - a dish of minced beef/chicken mixed in buttery pureed potatoes and tossed with onions & herbs. This time, a young lady dropped by to see if we are ready to order which I requested she check on us after a minute which she did so accordingly (checked). During the wait for the meal, glasses of water are served and refilled automatically (checked).I am most curious to examine this new open sandwich to see if it is capable of spicing up my day. Having learned that the concoction took the team months to perfect, I am hoping that it passed the mark remarkably. Served with a handful of crisp seasonal side greens, this Tartine Poulet Curry (S$17.90) comes with a unique flavor rarely seen in a French bistro. Making a bold change to the regular Poulet Citron in the previous menu; this one has a nice but mild spicy marination. Though I find the coarsely chopped chicken meat a bit chewy and dry, the spices did distract my attention from the less attractive bird. The curry jelled quite well with the cheddar along with the crunchy diced zucchini and tomato, of which, the mass emits a strong and lingering flavor in each mouthful. Overall, the combination is a success for its balanced flavor, without a fierce domination. I was told that it has been well-received by many non-locals for its subtle curry taste. While it tasted good, I feel that the Campagne bread needs less toasting time, to avoid having a hard and edgy crust that bruised my gums. If you ever spotted me tearing - the underlying cause is not the curry, sure thing. But what warms me, is the hospitality that comes from the heart. This has never occurred nor I heard from others who have dined at Paul in the past, but today, I am having waitress coming up to me, asking if the food tastes good (checked).J was seen enjoying the Pan Bagnat Ni\u00e7oise (S$16.90) - a specialty sandwich made with Pain de Mie bread using tuna mayonnaise topped with rings of red onion, tomatoes and piling up high with fresh salad leaves and slices of boiled eggs. The burger appeared in its clean defining look, not a messy setup like a drenched American version. Accordingly, it pleases J who is won over by its fresh texture and natural taste, less obscuring. We selfishly eat our own dish, each singing in approval. We have nothing to complain about, if anything, it has to be the dessert.Prominently pictured under the dessert section, I refused to flip the page, trying to nail down one Pandan treats. J gave a good laugh and left me with the decision rights. Should I point to my left or allow it to swift to the right, my eye ball swinging in pendulum. I had wanted a Pandan eclair but wish badly for the Pandan Millefeuille. J saved me from that ripping agony, chose the French puff pastry on my behalf. In less 5 minute, the Napoleon dessert arrived. My first impression - terrified. I felt intimidated by its unnatural green hue, the icing fondant has been awkwardly fabricated - simply a vanilla glaze. It left me wondering if the dish descriptions in the newspaper are reported correctly - the recipe has a Pandan-infused paste? Erm, we didn't taste any Pandan flavor throughout, but a stronger gula melaka (palm sugar) custard cream, much to our enjoyment. I liked the puff pastry for its light, crumbly texture though not ultra flaky and stacked up with a thick layer of creamy paste in the middle. The cream is smooth but slightly over-candied and a bit weighed down.",

Sipping a hot cup of coffee and biting into a warm butter croissant on a chilly winter day in Paris was the most memorable experience and I thought I could relive it here in Singapore at Paul Bakery. Although the seating was really cramped, the interior of Paul did remind me of Parisian patisseries. The chandeliers, French paintings and even the waitresses in white chef hats really simulate the setting of French restaurants. Food-wise, there were a few hits and misses. The highly recommended Chocolate Mellefeuille was a let down because the pastry was not crispy but limp instead. The chocolate flavor was good though, rich and not overly-sweet. The Praline Macaron was great, crusty on the outside and filled with creamy rich praline. The Caneles have a really good texture as well. The service was slow, probably because they were short of staff. It was difficult getting the attention of the waitstaff and the food took pretty long to arrive.",

Paul in Paris was magnifique too! These were all before Singapore has its own Paul located at Ngee Ann City. The ambience at Paul Singapore is entirely different than those in Europe. I like the warm cozy feelings I had experienced at Paul in London or Paris which unfortunately did not happened here. It was not bad here, just different. Few weeks back I had breakfast at Paul with my friend whom I used to go to school with. I opted the Petit d\u00e9jeuner chocolat set ($9.50) and I chose to have a Au pain du chocolat and a cup of chocolat viennois. Both were really good. Finally I got to have a decent hot chocolate beverage after having a bad one here at Starbucks in Singapore. Service was good too. I just wish more thoughts to be placed in the design of the menu. A bit cheap looking to me.",

I could tell that they KNEW I was looking at them, but 1 of them chose to serve another guest 2 tables away who were all Caucasians. That table didn't even ask for any service. The other younger Indian guy, who was talking to his friend earlier, pretended to be busy when his friend left. He continued to tidy a table for 5min with his BACK TURNED away from me. He then walked out of the shop for 2min for god knows what reason. How blatant! Fine by me if you'd prefer to serve a caucasion male over a young Chinese female. If you want to bring your culture and serve only older white Males, then Singapore is not a place for you. \u00a0That aside, kudos to the other two waitress, one of the Indian waitress was busy earlier, but approached me thereafter when she was done serving. Thank youUPDATES:the young Indian guy just keeps hanging around the cashier doing nothing on a Sunday . \u00a0To the boss, you're making a loss hiring him. And to the other Indian waiter with beard, your smug attitude won't get you anywhere in life.Only managed to take a pic of the smug waiter, not the younger one.",

Got a window seat which is good.Ordered a Crepe D'orange & a beetroot juice:- Service was alright. Quite attentive, asking whether I want warm or cold water, & whether I want ice cubes with my juice. - Beetroot juice was ok though pricey. Guess it comes with the territory as Paul Bakery is situated \u00a0strategically at one of the most prominent shopping malls in SG.- Crepe D'orange is no ordinary crepe as its the most sorry looking crepe I have eaten in my life .. Just 1 strawberry split into quarters. I was utterly shocked that they served it in this manner. The crepe itself was quite tasty, so in a way, it redeemed itself a bit.All in all, I'm disappointed with the eatery, and will think twice to go back there again. Maybe, just maybe, I may try their breads to see whether they are any good.",

Now, my biggest complaint is the poor quality of coffee and pastry. After a hectic day of shopping, I just wanted to sit down and get a nice hit of caffeine. But I really can't get pass the weak coffee that tastes so diluted. Tried the blueberry and chocolate tarts - crust is too thick and hard and the filling is nothing to write home about.

    "text": "The repertoire of 26 new dishes include hearty salads like the Salad de la Mer ($20.90++), a seafood salad that would make an ideal satisfying light lunch option with plump shrimps, mussels, octopus and creamy avocados. The zesty grapefruit and in house french dressing lends the greens a bright zesty flavour that resonates with me. Both main courses reflected the simplicity of French cooking and natural flavours of fresh, seasonal ingredients. The Longe de thon ($29.90++) was essentially a long steak of seared tuna whose core remained pinkish and tender, adorned with white sesame seeds. Magnificent in its own right, the fish fell out of sync with the sweet cranberry sauce and the side of tangy roasted seasonal vegetables, which were so appetizing that they could possibly steal the limelight of the plate. On the other hand, the Confit de Canard ($28.90++) may be an old-fashioned French classic but never fails to please the palates. Rubbed with herbs and cured in duck fat for one day before slow-roasted for 4 hours, the unctuous duck meat, albeit tad salty, streaked off the bones in strands.It might be quite a distinct version from most of the crispy-skinned versions here but the duck is fragrantly meaty and not greasy. The same side dish of roasted vegetables did complement the duck but perhaps pairing it with some chestnut velout\u00e9 with mushrooms may inject some variety? New iced teas like the Rosemary lime or Lemongrass Ginger were great options to refresh the palates and get one ready for desserts. However what piqued my curiosity was the beguiling Macaron Drink ($9.50++) shown below. Available also in Raspberry, Vanilla and Chocolate, I opted for the Pistachio flavour. Predictably a sweet maestro of pistachio macarons speedily whizzed to gritty bits with milk, it turned out to be less sugary than the original macarons, tempered to a balanced creaminess with a characteristic texture. Leaning gingerly against one another, the golden Waffles ($13.90++), as sturdy as the Pyramids of Egypt, were understandably more similar to the light crunchy Brussels waffles than the dense, chewy Liege waffles. Yet too much of a good thing may warrant a concern to oral pleasure as these square parcels were rather rigid inside-out. \u00a0 Above all, I am heartened that Paul stays true to its boulangerie roots and delivers the promised quality in their forte areas, the bread. Out of all the new dishes I've tried, the Tartine Boeuf ($19.90++) secured a special place in my heart. A touch of herb cream cheese, hints of tart balsamic vinegar and a smattering of soft caramelized onions on succulent sirloin steak is all it takes to bring the humble countryside bread a whole new level. Even the starter basket of crusty baguette (below) sprung to life with just a slight dollop of its creamy unsalted artisan French butter.",

There is also a take away counter, like a traditional bakery with many tasty items calling out to be taken home. This take away counter presents another odd policy/system that should be better thought out. There are items at the take away counter that aren't on the menu, and you can't order them if you are dining in. This is such an odd decision, it is the same restaurant/kitchen the food is already prepared, sell the item for a dollar more and laugh all the way to the bank; yet they would not serve it. Speaking of serving items, our drinks arrived much after our food, and many follow up requests, even a freshly baked waffle came before Ice Lemon Tea.

Also try not to go with too much of an expectation.My friend got a breakfast set while I had the crepes. They were nothing to write home to and with the choices you get in SG now, I hardly think just doing the basic works. Also, I hardly feel that way, but the quality of the food made me feel that it was really overpriced.I was genuinely looking forward to trying the desserts since Paul is famed for their bakes. Am a little disappointed to report that both options I picked - lemon meringue tart and another pastry - were lacklustre. Moral of the story - listen to your foodie friends when they tell you not to bother with a place.",

When you call to place you order, it looks like they are making you a favor. \u00a0And good luck if are with a stroller! \u00a0Two star instead if one, because the good is still great.

    "text": "The worst cafeshop which somehow has been extemely overated more than it deserves. From the service to the food quality, there is no reason why this cafe still exists.. Even in a prime location such as Nge Ann City/Takashimaya at Orchard??! It is such an embarrassement to French cuisine which highly values its cooking quality with long heritage.We ordered a simple baquette sandwich which came with a mushroom soup. The sandwich was plain and lack of freshness while the soup was salty, like it just came out from an instant soup packet, and the accompanied bun was like a 1-week old bread which was hard like a rock. Goodness, that was really injustice considering the price we had to pay for such a below quality. For the sake of culinary world, do something about the food! Improve and stop serving less-thought and low-quality of food to the hungry shoppers.",

I had to ask while flagging a waitress down to get another drink after my glass had been empty for quite some time. To make it worse, I had to remind her much later that I hadn't gotten my drink yet.If you have nothing else on your agenda for the day, then I would say go here. The menu is great. \u00a0However, the service is slow and spotty.",

Strawberry Tart for hertinyurl.com/93aqdwgChocolate Sundae for metinyurl.com/8hty8a4Both desserts were fantastic and both were eagerly engulfed.I would not hesitate to have dessert here again.",
