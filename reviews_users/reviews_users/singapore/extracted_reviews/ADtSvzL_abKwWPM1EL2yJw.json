    "text": "I understand that Blue Ginger may be a bit of an institution for Peranakan cuisine and I can see why. A particularly easy place for Westerners to dine as the menu is varied without being too extensive, and the descriptions are well written with certain items identified as special recommendations. The price level is higher than what you would expect at a 'local joint' but less than those of many of the other 'westernised' eateries' we visit. We enjoyed every dish we ordered, but stand outs were the whole sambal fish, the chicken rolls and the prawns. The whole fish is a little intimidating when it first arrives at the table but just get stuck in! The sweet sambal over the crispy fried skin... dericious! I also am a sucker for sago pudding with gula melaka... not bad here, but the sago had congealed a bit more than necessary and I prefer it without the ice shavings. Service is polite and attentive. Decor is a bit dated (I thought) but in keeping with a traditionalist theme and \u00a0far from off-putting. Their wine and beer list could probably be widened a bit more, especially wine by the glass. We spent $60 per person for starters, mains and two drinks each. I think this is a great place to bring visitors to give them a taste of peranakan cuisine. Next I want to try Peranaman and then off to Melaka for the graduation of peranakan cuisine!",

Food is unique fusion -- not all the flavors worked for us -- very strong fishy tastes on some items made them almost inedible. Service was unhurried but efficient -- but we found ourselves looking for the waiter because the pauses were long. Worth a visit if you are looking to try something different, but, thinking back, there are many other worthy restaurants in the same neighborhood, so I'd skip it next time -- not on the \"must visit\" list at all.",

The portions are just nice that it fits into the mouth comfortably in one go and melts neatly into your mouth in one superb food orgasm.Everything else is spicy spicy spicy and the dessert sweet sweet sweet. Didn't help that our group had a diabetic and needed something not sweet. Not much options for him there. Not even fruits. So don't bring any diabetic friends and relatives there.",

I had noticed this restaurant a few times from the Kamayan across the street and went to eat there today with a friend, and yes: this place is really good. The cuisine is described as peranankan (the mixure of chinese and malay that is typical for the singapore chinese), but I suspect this is a means to present a cuisine that is really a fusion of the different cultures of Southeast Asia. No matter: the result is excellent. I had chicken in an Indonesian sauce based on nuts I did not know but that were delicious - chocolate like (ayam buah keluak), and my companion had pork knuckles braised to perfection in another herb mix (babi hong). Both tasted delicious and I certainly go back for more. Even the rice on itself was perfumed in a way I didn't recognize. All in all, we had an excellent meal - the best I had in this area of Singapore. And the prices were - by European standards - certainly affordable. It is however safe to make reservations: we were lucky to be early.",

The preserved pickles were one of my favorites...cant stop gorging myself. Next came \u00a0Otak, grilled fish cake, which i dont get to eat living in the states. This is one of my favorite dishes, but I'm not impressed with the texture served by the chef...kinda mushy and lack flavor. The Juhu kangkong was excellent, something different from what I've tasted before. Ayam Bush keluak is my sister favorite, unfortunately is the least appetizing on the taste totem pole for me. The black nuts tasted like dark chocolate...i think is an acquired taste, just not for me. Telor cinchaluk, look and taste like omelette, is just ok. The soup, bakwan kepeting, is definetely a must have if u like soup. Is out of this world!! Ikan masak Assam gulai is very good, but I would prefer the king prawns than the fish. My sis asked if I prefer the prawns or fish, told her prawns, and she ordered the fish!! I felt the servers were rushing us which i tootally understand due to the size of the restaurant. Overall, it was a good dinning experience.",

Jerry became my great eating out partner. \u00a0Service was friendly and the place was clean and modern. \u00a0No complaints.",

My sister introduced me to the very traditional food here, we got: 1) Kwuh pie tee cups - outside was pretty good 2) beef rendang - it was good but a little bland for me 3) tamarind prawns - the best dish I had, love the flavors in this 4) white wine - do not order 5) otta otta - interesting and worth an order Portions are quite small but there is unlimited rice and pickled veggies.",

    "text": "This is a review of a delayed birthday dinner with a friend at The Blue Ginger. \u00a0This is an update to a previous review. \u00a0Since, with \u00a0the exception of kueh pie tee, I had completely different dishes this time, I thought it was worthwhile to write a new review.Plus, the second \u00a0time around, my overall experience was more consistently \u00a0positive.Obviously, the ambiance has not changed. \u00a0So, I will mostly pull from my previous review. \u00a0I also have now included interior photos .The room is stylish. \u00a0There are beautiful accents and warm colours providing the room with a warm and comfortable home-like feel. \u00a0It is a pretty small restaurant and the seating can be a touch cramped. \u00a0I am relatively large and this doesn't help the situation.tinyurl.com/b3r7c7qtinyurl.com/bh2tzmqAn additional positive (at least for me), is that, on both visits, they were playing Pink Martini. \u00a0This is one of my favorite musical groups and not one that I would expect to find playing in a Singaporean restaurant.The service was more consistent than my first visit. \u00a0The staff was attentive and very present. \u00a0They checked often to insure things were going well. \u00a0I also thought the \u00a0meal was better paced. \u00a0They were all very friendly, polite, and professional.The food ranged from good to extremely good. \u00a0The food was also nicely presented.Mixed pickles and sambal belachan are provided on each table. \u00a0However, these are not complimentary. \u00a0There is a small charge. \u00a0The rice is also included in these charges. \u00a0Throughout the meal, the rice is served as needed.tinyurl.com/askhol5tinyurl.com/c7j6nqxKueh Pie Tee (Shredded bamboo shoots and turnips garnished with shrimp in pie tee cups) - This was very good. \u00a0The cups were perfectly fried and the fillings were fresh.tinyurl.com/bg5v54lNonya Rolls - They were quite delicious. \u00a0They were super crunchy. \u00a0The yam added a very nice sweetness that typical spring rolls do not have.tinyurl.com/afmeak2Ayam Panggang \"Blue Ginger\" (De-boned chicken thigh and drumstick flavoured with coconut milk rich in exotic spices and grilled) - I am lucky this was one of two great chicken dishes I've had recently. \u00a0The chicken was so moist and tender. \u00a0The flavours went so well together. \u00a0The coconut, dash of heat, and other spices just took this chicken dish over the top.tinyurl.com/cgbkzd3Beef Rendang (Tender beef cubes prepared in rich coconut milk spiced with ginger, lemon-grass, lime leaves and a dash of curry powder) - This is the best rendang I've eaten yet. \u00a0Now, I've not had that many. \u00a0But this was a very tasty dish. \u00a0There was just loads of flavour. \u00a0There was a richness and almost a smokiness to the flavours.tinyurl.com/a49u8jdNonya Fish Head Curry (Red snapper with ladies fingers and eggplant cooked in a traditional home-style curry) - The only specific request my friend made was she wanted the fish head curry. \u00a0This was my inaugural fish head curry. \u00a0I am not sure what I was waiting for. \u00a0I have no idea how this stacks up against other fish head curries. \u00a0I do know it was extremely good. \u00a0The seasonings in the broth were amazing. \u00a0The fish was tender and flaky. \u00a0Some way, the spices did not overpower the delicate taste of the fish. \u00a0The vegetables were crisp. \u00a0The okra did not have even a hint of the slipperiness that can so easily develop with okra. \u00a0This was just an all around great dish. \u00a0Visually, it was also quite appetizing.tinyurl.com/a87tetsReceipt ($102.75):tinyurl.com/c8r7pexOverall, this was a very enjoyable dining experience. \u00a0The food was consistently well-prepared with very substantial and well-balanced flavours. \u00a0The attentive and friendly service combined with the warm and inviting room to compliment the food perfecty. \u00a0In my last review, I was rounding up a bit. \u00a0For this visit to The Blue Ginger, I am providing a very solid four star review.",

    "text": "Looking for a 'landing pad' that perfectly encompasses the worldly influences of Singaporean food culture, decades of gritty history, and charming old-world architecture and interior design? Well, this is my definite bet for the perfect place to go (and you can tell, because you will see visitors gathering in large round tables from China and the 'west' grinning from ear to ear, clamouring about the toothsome splendour that is The Blue Ginger). The Beef Rendang is something that is on par with your friendly neighbourhood makcik's best efforts... chunks of beef in a dark maroon gravy (careful! it's so good that you might find yourself licking the plate clean) that's been sitting in a stew enriched with shallots, chilli peppers, lemon grass, turmeric, coconut, and galangal for more than four hours... Servings are larger than at the Grandma's Restaurants on Orchard, where they are puny and never enough, and they come up to about the same price-tag (and taste a LOT better).Other must-orders are the Otak-otak (shiok as hell!), with the lemongrass so freshly potent that your nostrils will be flaring in pleasure, and the Deep-fried Brinjal in Sambal... I'm getting hungry for Blue Ginger all over again!",

    "text": "A friend was visiting so I wanted to take her to a Peranakan restaurant. \u00a0My usual favorite Candlenut was fully booked (it was Friday night alas!) so I called Blue Ginger on the recommendation of a Singaporean friend and got us a table.The restaurant is set in a shop house in Tanjong Pagar, a good place to take visitors. \u00a0Renovation is simple, and so are the dishes, they have a feeling of home-cooked fare to them - unpretentious, not fancy but delicious, definitely a day-to-day staple. \u00a0We ordered the kueh pie tee, the bakwan kepeting (soup made of pork and crab meatball with bamboo shoots), beef rendang, kangkong and a seabass cooked in a spicy tamarind gravy. \u00a0I would say everything turns out to be pretty good, just like what fine Peranakan cooking should be and the prices are reasonable and definitely cheaper than Candlenut. \u00a0The only complaint I have is the pork and crab meatball with bamboo shoots had somewhat of a pungent smell to it. The food is definitely above average but I would say that it lacks the surprises I get from Candlenut where I feel the presentation of the food and the combination of ingredients and flavors are all perfect. \u00a0It is definitely not bad but is also not my go-to place. \u00a0Nevertheless, it's a good option considering the lower prices in general.",

I was there a few years ago and was so impressed that I went back recently. \u00a0There were many local diners on the night so it is a sign that the food is good.

It was a bit more expensive that the food centres, but the food was tasty, authentic, the ambient was great, and the service was great.",
