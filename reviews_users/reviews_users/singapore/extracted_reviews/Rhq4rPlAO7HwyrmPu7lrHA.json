You are create with a coffee martini as a welcome drink. I had a raspberry sour type drink and then a delicious New York sour with smoke blown into it and a cute marshmallow garnish. I was hungry and got the sirloin as a snack. The entire staff was highly attentive as I also kept finishing my bowl of crackers and it was instantly refilled. I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "The Other Room is a very cool newish bar in an unexpected place - off the lobby of a hotel and the Marriott Hotel at that. \u00a0But they are doing some amazing work here with both infused liquors as well as barrel aged Cocktails, so it's definitely worth seeking out. \u00a0Plus, if you ever needed a break from shopping on Orchard Road, this would be a great place although it is open only in the evenings. \u00a0Anyway, upon arrival, I received a welcome espresso martini which was served in an eye drop bottle! \u00a0Very cool although I opted not to use the tincture and went straight for the bottle . \u00a0I tried one of their bottle aged cocktails - Boulvardier - which was really good, as the barrel aging helps smooth out the Campari just a bit. \u00a0It was also served with a beer back, which made it doubly enjoyable. \u00a0I also tried one of my usual drinks - a Vieux Carre, which was also executed very well. \u00a0Overall, I loved the drinks, the concept and the excellent service here. \u00a0And it's also great to see a new cocktail bar that isn't on Hong Kong or Amoy Street. \u00a0There is a small food menu as well, which I didn't have a chance to try. \u00a0But there will be a next time, and definitely looking forward to it.",
