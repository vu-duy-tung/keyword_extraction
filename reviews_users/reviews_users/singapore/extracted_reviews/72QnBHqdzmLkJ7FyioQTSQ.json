Skin of duck is very crispy, but sauce was not generous. We had to ask for extra sauce however was told that additional $1 is required. Wasnt reflected on our bill though. Give the fatty pork (\u4e1c\u6ce2\u8089) a miss. Mixed vegs for balancing our meaty meal and its a good mixture of nuts & vegs. Pork floss prawn is rather dry but prawns are fresh. Very family friendly place, baby chair & utensils provided. Air con is rather strong, good to bring an outerwear if your child is not used to lower temp. Bill comes up to $190. Portion is good for 5 full tummies.",

Laced with herbs with a really crispy skin, the meat is tender, fragrant and really sweat. Pity the sauce that comes with it is limited, and they charge you if you want extra. I usually get the duck, together with the spinach with three eggs to make a meal out of it, and I always leave satisfied. Prices are affordable and half a duck will be just right for two people.",

    "text": "A Chinese restaurant that was named after the antique way of calling a waiter to your table was definitely interesting in my book. The dining experience here was quite satisfactory as well. The over d\u00e9cor of the restaurant very closely followed an old period drama style teahouse that we often see in dramas, with the waiters themselves dressed in character. The menu items were of course very traditional, but their specialty was the roasted duck and also their soups. I loved their high quality broths that were boiled for several hours at a go for sure - all of them were thick and not greasy at the same time regardless if it was a meat or vegetable based soup. The duck dish was amazing, and nothing like those roast duck rice that we often order at the local kopitiam. This was thick juicy slabs of duck, with a layer of soft fat covered with a crispy top skin roasted to perfection - best duck ever! Price point is a little higher than I would expect, but if you avoid dishes that are common or can be found for cheaper at a coffee shop, then you should be fine.",

Simply awesome. Even when writing the review now, i'm craving for this. Definitely must-try dish in Dian Xiao Er.Together with the roasted duck, i would order Seafood Fried Rice with XO Sauce. The fried rice is filled with seafood like prawn and sotong. Very generous of them. Fried Rice is pretty spicy because of the XO Sauce. But i simply love it.",

I should really head back there soon and get a refresher of more dishes!",
