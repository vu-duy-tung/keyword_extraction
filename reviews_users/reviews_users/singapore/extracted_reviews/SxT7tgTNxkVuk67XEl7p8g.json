The decor is pretty sweet, especially the clear roof ceiling at the back of the cafe, the fairy lights and the adobe walls. Came here twice on a weekend night and a morning. There was already a crowd so we had to queue a little. Tried their breakfast menus as well as their deserts. Both were good, but nothing great in my books. Price is reasonable of course due to the quiet location.I have to commend their staff, particularly a male staff wearing black frame glasses, couldn't get his name. Excellent service, always with a smile and cheery attitude! Also orders were quick.Would definitely come back again, likely shooting for non-peak times again.Not sure if we caught a one-off experience but the quick service was a plus.",

Love the carbonara with bacon, the creamy white sauce taste homemade, poached egg is well-cooked, spaghetti is Q, portion is just right. Love the waffle with chocolate ice cream. The waffle may look simple and plain, but that's the beauty of it. It is perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and airy on the inside. Goes really well with a scoop of chocolate ice cream. One of the best waffle I've ever had.Love the hot chocolate (70% dark chocolate). Rich and creamy and taste like a bar of dark chocolate.  Love the chicken nuggets. Crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. Overall, service and ambience is good, menu is well categorized for easy ordering. Just hope that they show a list of food photos on the menu so that those who has not been there before, know what to expect and order from the menu.",

However, i find most of them pretty inexperienced. They had 4 choices for 'soup of the day' which really should be soups of the day. We had the mushroom soup and it was quite pleasant. Beef cottage pie was not available so we thought of going for more desserts since there was a rave about it here.Waffle is a must; come early for it so that waiting time won't be long. When asked what was \"eton mess\", the staff said \"choc cake\", and what was \"blackout\", she said \"choc cake\". Could have been a little more specific and professional in this. In the end she recommended the blackout which was a total disappointment because it's just a very moist chocolate cake.Price is on the high. For the service and the quantity of food (the $5 chicken nugget comes with literally 5 piece of chicken karaage), i will only return if i am seriously craving for waffles. Else, nah.",

Period.A rising star in a little hideout, Jalan Riang, it's really not that difficult to find with the cute red and white vintage beetle parked right in front of the shop. You might actually have better luck locating the Cafe than an empty parking lot!My fave there gotta be their Rootbeer Cake.Who in the world will think that rootbeer infused chocolate cake would taste so good! With a scope of vanilla ice cream, the combination is just like a regular rootbeer float just that instead of drinking, you are actually eating it.The salted caramel truffle has a touch of chocolate bitterness that fuses with the sweet and salty caramel. Rich and tantalising, it's a really cool chocolate treat! If you can't get enough of the chocolate, try their chocolate molten lava cake. There's seriously more \"molten chocolate\" than cake in this dessert. Havent had the chance to try their savoury dishes but their desserts are definitely good enough for me. ;)",

    "text": "Until now, I still do not know why this place is so popular. Ironically, the desserts did not impress even though Wimbly Lu is famous for them. \u00a0 The Hazelnut Butterscotch Blondie ($4.50) was too dry and chalky with rancid untoasted nuts though the butterscotch sauce was rich and sweet. I don't understand the logic of molten lava cakes \u00a0$6without ice cream or creme anglaise sauce but I know some do. The version here is very rich, dense and luckily not too sweet. However, the cake texture was still dry as compared to Domino's or Morgansfield. \u00a0 The Chocolate Tofu Cake $6 did not taste anything of tofu but I guessed the ingredient blended into the mousse did help to give it a smooth, creamy texture. However, the biscuit base was stale and not crunchy as described by the staff.   With a crisp texture and some even noted a resemblance with cereal taste, the signature waffles with one scoop ice cream ($8.50) was the better ones that day. I wonder if the salted caramel ice cream came from Salted Caramel at Upp Thomson though. But it was too small a scoop for the size of the waffles.Mediocre Cheese Toast Melts which can be skipped Another recommended item was the Chocolate Root Beer Cake $6. Think layers of root-beer-infused ganache intersecting with chocolate sponge. I like chocolate and root beer. But the combination of both tasted strange.Blackout Cake $6Bottomline, a cafe that is simply over-rated. Perhaps it is crowded because the seats are limited. My companions were generous to comment that the ambience was good, for instance the settings such as the red bricks tiled wall and lightings. But I tend to ignore ambience and focus on the food. Given the substandard quality of the chocolate desserts, I would not fancy a return.",

    "text": "There's a lovely conservatory-style area at the back of the caf\u00e9, preceded by a dim but cosy seating area facing an open kitchen/bakery and chocolate display cabinet.It was raining that day, and I actually suspect that they redecorate according to the season or occasion! My evidence: the staff were visibly buzzing around inside before they opened, and they could have been tweaking the decor! Also, I've seen pictures of the caf\u00e9 filled with little hearts, all posted in February, as well as other similar pictures with Halloween lanterns. I'd be very impressed if they actually hung those raining clouds to reflect the weather outside! It really added a fantastic touch to Wimbly Lu's intimate and personal setting.To make sure that my friend and I were having a legitimate lunch and not just stuffing our faces with desserts instead of having a proper meal, we ordered a double seafood and cheese toasty ($6) which was so-so.Me made our next choice from having read other reviews and recommendations - waffle with salted caramel ice cream, plus a topping of maple syrup. ($8.50)This waffle was pretty much perfect, it really hit that criteria of a crisp exterior and fluffy insides. From what I've heard, every single waffle served is just as perfect! Talk about quality control.The salted caramel ice cream was delicious - flavourful but not sickeningly sweet. We definitely could have had a bigger scoop. The maple syrup was a good choice of topping as well.Now I'm no expert on sticky date pudding, as this was my first one ever. I've got to say that it was delightful! Warm, gooey, sweet, and addictive. I only got to taste dates in my last mouthful, though. I'm not sure if sticky date puddings have to taste strongly of dates.It would have made more sense for the dense, rich pudding to come with pouring cream or ice cream, but it didn't, so we ordered an addition scoop of honey cinnamon ice cream. ($3)The cinnamon taste was a little stronger than expected, which was a surprise, but a good one - like apple pie in ice cream form! There wasn't much taste of honey, it was probably used mainly to sweeten. The ice cream flavour didn't go that well with the pudding. However, the texture was perfect in my terms. Not too icy, yet not too heavy and gooey - somewhere among that blissful in between. We found ourselves craving more of that honey cinnamon ice cream!With service charge, the bill came to somewhere around $25 in total for the both of us, which is pretty reasonable for the great atmosphere and food. Wimbly Lu is definitely somewhere I'll return to for a relaxed dessert experience the next time I visit Singapore!",

But we loved the ambiance so much that the food didn't really mattered all that much after awhile. I would recommend you stick with the \"safer\" choices then sit back, relax & enjoy the place. Read a book. It's a beautiful way to spend a lazy sunday afternoon :) The food (desserts) 1. Root beer cake - We saw many tables order this + It was highly instagramed + It was a chef's choice... so we went against our gut feeling (which was warning us that root-beer & chocolate will probably taste weird) and order it. Sadly, our guts were right! This tasted pretty strange! I am a fan of root beer and chocolate. But not both together. Lesson learnt. 2. Waffles with salted caramel ice cream & toffee sauce - Since we went for a risky choice with #1, we decided opt for a safer choice with the waffles which was not bad. Average. Safe. Expected. My only complain was the toffee sauce which tasted nothing like the sticky, rich brown toffee sauce I expected. This was a translucent, honey colored liquid which tasted more like a cheap syrup than toffee! The salted caramel ice cream was also more salty than I'd prefer. 3. Honey lemon - Ok4 Scones - A good safe choice. Served with cream and jam... just the way I like my scones :) Service - Great.",

I think it's the perfect corner to take off your inhibitions along with your shoes and sit cross legged on the mat. You can do that while enjoying a yummylicious dessert.There's quite a selection of sweets but Wimbly Lu place quite a large emphasis on their chocolates. Caught sight of the Root Beer Float Cake, which has a slice of moist chocolate fudge cake soaked in root beer and ice cream and good ol' choc fudge. It's a dessert in a dessert! I don't know why this didn't appear on my table but then again it's really lousy judgement on my part for letting S do the ordering. :P Heard that this is pretty awesome.

We ordered the following: waffles with salted caramel ice cream and maple syrup, truffle fries, banoffee pie and iced and hot honey lemon for beverages. My verdict: nothing worth mentioning except the banoffee pie was really good! Not overly sweet with generous amount of banana and the digestive crust was nicely salted, so all together was \u00a0pleasant!",

    "text": "\"Just go for the desserts, skip the real food.\"That's what I heard about Wimbly Lu. Well what happened was we had dinner at Fat Cat, and then we hopped over to Wimbly for desserts! A friend on Instagram also recommended their Orange Flour-less Cake, and someone said their Waffles are good. My neighbour told me about their molten lava cake and smores pie, which is then what we ordered. Chocolate overload!The molten lava cake was not as sweet as I expected though, which is good. Still gave me a sugar high (ok perhaps it was the smores pie) but the chocolate quality is detectable to be better than average. With the smores pie, it is a layer of granola crushed bits, with a huge chunk of chocolate, and molten marshmellows. Super decadent. super sweet.The place itself is very whimsical and nice. I really liked the decor, especially the ceiling fairy lights and the adobe walls. It was quite packed on a Sunday night as people lined up to sit for some coffee and desserts. The noise level is a bit high, but that's expected.",

    "text": "I heard good things, so I went... and ehhh I think it was all right.First impressions are GREAT. It's a BEAUTIFUL shop - vintage VW Beetle out front, great shopfront, and stepping in, you see the dark brown brickwork, and the greenhouse-style roof at the back... it's pretty gorgeous.Menu-wise one should remember that this is a chocolate shop. I wouldn't look at anything else, especially if the store itself says so. I've had a friend rave about their spicy hot chocolate (and he's a dude, so it must be pretty good). I... liked it, but I didn't think it was all that.The gang and I had a raft of other desserts too, and I was particularly looking forward to the clafoutis - cherries in a chocolate tart? Heck Yeah! When it came though... it was kinda thin and dry; perhaps their interpretation was a little different?This spot gives me a \"style over substance\" feel, but when so many friends are in love with it, I'll have to give it another try. And hope they've fixed the clafoutis.",

There's also a great ambience to chill out with friends.However, on weekends, do note that if your party is small you may get shifted around as larger parties come in and they need you to give up your seat. Didn't happen to me but the waiter did give advance notice in case it happened.",

    "text": "Located at Jalan Riang, Wimbly Lu was certainly a hard place to find for someone who did not know the area well. It is perhaps easier to identify their adorably vintage signature car parked outside which is quite hard to miss. I was brought there by a friend who had raved about the place and their waffles.The place was not big but very cosy and comfortable, with quite a nice homely feel to it. We went there in the day but I was told by my friend that it was gorgeous at night with the lights and an open area so I would have to go again to witness it for myself. The staff were extremely pleasant with huge smiles and an ever-ready attitude, which made it a very delightful experience indeed. The happiness of the staff seemed to be rather infectious as it made me feel rather happy too despite the rain outside.I ordered a chicken baked rice which seemed to be more of an eastern take on chicken baked rice, without the creaminess that most baked rice dishes have. In fact, there was no sauce, and it was simply a slightly sweet chicken and mushroom rice, reminiscent of claypot rice, baked with a layer of cheese that was likely some form of cream cheese instead of the usual cheddar or mozarella. Although it was not the best baked rice I've had, it was quite an interesting take on chicken baked rice and went rather well together as a whole. We also had their famous waffles with cinnamon icecream, and though the ice-cream was far too grainy, the waffles were wonderfully fluffy on the outside and crispy on the inside.With the stellar service I received and yummy waffles, I would be more than glad to go back again to verify if it is indeed as lovely as my friend had described at night.",

    "text": "I dropped by Wimbly Lu one evening with the parents as I was craving some sort of a chocolate cake. As I live around the area, wimbly lu was probably the closest cafe for me to get a nice cup of coffee and cake. I have heard raving reviews about the place from some friends who have been there a couple of times. My parents were familiar with the area so we found the cafe quite easily. However, I believe it might be pretty difficult for most people to get there by foot as it is located in the private housing estate quite a distance from the nearest MRT station (Serangoon MRT). The cafe is easily identifiable by their signature red car parked outside. The decor of the place is lovely, and great attention is put into the display pieces and ornaments placed around. Walking in, antique looking shelves line the wall, giving the place a touch of vintage. The rustic red bricked wall on one side, coupled with the beautiful lighting gave the place a homely, yet romantic atmosphere. I had their Rootbeer cake, which essentially was a piece of dark chocolate cake infused with root beer, topped with a chocolate root beer syrup and served with vanilla ice-cream. The chocolate cake was alright, and I could taste the hint of root beer with each mouthful. However, the chocolate did not come through sufficiently, which was pretty disappointing as what can be worse in a chocolate cake than not tasting the chocolate. That said, the chocolate syrup was divine. The chocolate was thick, but not too heavy, and the root beer flavour combined with it brilliantly. The vanilla ice-cream was slightly icy, but otherwise went well with the cake. I also had a flat white, which was pretty good!The service at Wimbly Lu was brilliant. The service staff were attentive and patient, answering my questions about their various desserts. Overall, this cafe is a pretty awesome find and I will definitely be back to try more of their offerings (especially their waffles, which I heard is pretty good).",

    "text": "really good desserts at this small store in a surprisingly hipster part of serangoon - I live near the area and never knew this place even existed (except for all the posts floating about the blogosphere on this place and its cajun neighbour). I didn't really know what to expect, actually - I tried to come with tempered expectations in case it didn't actually live up to the hype - but came away liking it quite a bit.it's a small space (so be prepared to wait), but gorgeously furnished in kitschy retrovintage furnishings and what I feel is rather old-school american - which also leads me to ask: have you also noticed that hipster places in singapore take on a vintage persona from history that never quite happened to us? I feel like this place could fit in fantastically in seattle, but here seems a little like an isolated microcosm of american fifties-style coffee shops.and the food? pretty good, really. we had two waffles \u00a0- both of which came warm, crisp outside with soft insides. I think this ought to be a sure-order; it's a rather large portion as well. we also had a bread pudding - served with cr\u00e8me anglaise - as well as a still molten chocolate lava cake. I think the latter was more impressive - the chocolate was sufficiently darkwell-worth a return, and especially so after dinner at the fat cat.",
