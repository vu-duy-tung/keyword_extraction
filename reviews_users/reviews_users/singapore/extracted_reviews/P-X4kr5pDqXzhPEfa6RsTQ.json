When the bill came, they refused to give any restitution for it. That is a bad business practice in the service industry. Shows a lot of arrogance. We certainly won't return again.

This place doesn't get that crowded, so no reservations were needed when I called to check. We got the veggie brown rice bowl, zucchini pasta with pesto, and mushroom soup to share. We felt sufficiently filled as their portions aren't stingy.I really enjoyed the brown rice bowl, because it was topped with a mix of veggies, chirashi style, and had a choice of two sauces over it. Tasted like a brown rice topped with guacamole ingredients - so yum! Our mushroom soup was filled with the goodness of mushrooms, and because this place is dairy-free, this soup is not the run-of-the-mill cream of mushroom, but rather, a blended, chunky emulsion of mushrooms. Very tasty. I really enjoyed the zucchini pasta, which is spiraled raw zucchini, tossed with a pesto. Carb-free, guilt-free, and raw.We finished it off with a raw chocolate \"cheesecake\", which had a nut base, and the \"cheese\" in the cake wasn't very apparent, but it was a pleasant chocolate \"custard\" of sorts. I really enjoyed my meal here, without feeling that something had to give for the dairy and meat that was missing. I would revisit again with no qualms!",

I ate here multiple times and preferred the quinoa burger both on a gluten free bun (which was amazing given the often tough texture of gluten free breads in Singapore), as well as on lettuce. It's a quaint place that's not crowded with a good ambiance. Easy music and free wi-if make it a good relaxing spot as well. They offer multiple deserts and food for dinning in or to-go. I haven't tried the sweets because I avoid most sugars but many of their ingredients are listed with coconut sugar or dates - most of which are raw. I am a very picky and health conscious eater but I will definitely come here again whenever I'm in Singapore.",

Literally the BEST place that I recommend any of my health loving friends to visit in Singapore.First off - the staff are so friendly. I would come here to eat lunch everyday in Singapore if I could. They are just so bright and cheery. The ambience is very chilled and laid back and the food is wonderful. There is no booking so if you're coming for a weekend brunch, I would recommend coming early because the place does fill up very fast.There is a lot on offer to order on the menu and I feel there is something for everyone. If you're vegan then this is heaven on earth but if you're not, you won't think your friend has just brought you into hell either. There are burgers and meats on the menu but I feel The Living Cafe has gone out of its way to offer the best quality food possible for each category. No hidden nasties here.They also have a big fridge filled of yummy raw treats! I remember how excited I was to find The Living Cafe in Singapore after having discovered raw treats in the US and the UK. This place had become Utopia. Upstairs you will find a huge selection of books which make excellent additions to any food lovers library. They also sell bits and bobs that health freaks (me) in Singapore generally have a hard time finding such as Bee Pollen, Coconut Oil, Spiralizer, Vitamix..Even if you're not that 'into' being healthy I would definitely give this place a go to see what its all about. And if you're brave enough, try one of their Wheatgrass shots. Take them instead of Tequila. Same bitterness but the after effect out weighs it, I assure you! ;).",

Dining here felt like I was back in the LA vegan scene. I thought of it as a cousin to Cafe Gratitude. I started off with a Pure Green (wheatgrass, celery, spinach, parsley). It's a drink for those who chase after nutrients as opposed to flavor. The Zucchini Pesto Pasta also tasted healthy. It's for those who enjoy bland dishes. I am one of those people so I liked it. The desserts and smoothies are sweet. Try the yummy Spirulina Mintball. The mint is the superstar ingredient. The heart-shaped cookies made of dehydrated raspberries were an unguilty pleasure. The Chocolate Monkey (cashew milk, banana, dates, cacao) made a delightfully filling post-dessert. Will definitely be coming back to Living Cafe for more nutritious goodies!",

And the air conditioning system needs some servicing too as it feels like we are on a fan ventilated room instead. decor is nothing original but passable. location wise it is on a row of shophouses, with construction going on next to it, so it is not a prime hang out location.Onto the food. Never order the cake! we ordered 2 brownies and that must be one of the worst dessert i have had in recent years. and for an indiscriminating chocolate lover, i really find those brownies hard to swallow! freshness is definitely a key issue, i could taste (and smell) distinctly more refrigerator coolant/ refrigerant than chocolate! i wonder if that's their attempt at fat-free brownies (not mentioned anywhere that it is fat-free), or aged brownies. these goodies should have been tossed! the quinoa salad i have fared better in term of freshness, yet the dressing left me in astonishment! i could taste only soy sauce for the dressings!!!being famished after our morning jog, i have hardly the energy to complain then. But the memory of that awful brownies, is enough to kill off any chocolate cravings I have. It's such a pity, i really love the concept, the menu, the staff, sigh~",

    "text": "I love the living cafe so much, I could cry. Located on Bukit Timah and 5th Avenue, I'd be here day after day if it weren't so far and out of the way from where I lived. As I try to get away from the plethora of oil laden carb heavy hawker food and onto the raw foods wagon, I start to realise how much Singapore is lacking in it's healthy, organic, gluten/dairy/refined sugars free cafes. In fact, if I'm not wrong, The Living Cafe is the only of it's kind so far here in Singapore (if someone knows of another raw cafe, please let me know!)The Living Cafe specializes in food that nourishes your body, from the inside out. Most of their menu is raw (meaning, they are all raw vegan foods that have not been heated above 115 degrees fahrenheit in order to preserve it's nutrients). I know, sounds like they'd only serve salads, correct? Wrong. My favorites on the menu include their Zucchini Pesto Pasta (note: this isn't actually pasta but zucchini shredded to look like spaghetti and pesto sauce homemade uses herbs and nuts), their Raw Lasagne, Raw Vegetable soups (cold - perfect for a hot day), their Living Rolls (rice paper rolls), Tofu Avocado Rolls, Raw Zucchini Dip (with Flaxseed crackers to dip) and not forgetting their AMAZING AMAZING raw/gluten/refined sugar free desserts. Honestly, the desserts in itself make a trip down here worth it (imagine tiramisu that actually tastes like tiramisu but made solely out of coconut, dates, nuts and other whole ingredients that give you a sugar fix WITHOUT the sugar high)I love raw foods for it's long term benefits as well as for how good it makes me feel right away, however, making raw foods is truly an art and without the proper knowledge and creative skills, you'd end up eating salads everyday. The Living Cafe truly makes it easy to eat raw from time and time with their creativeness and amazing sauces that liven up otherwise tasteless vegetables. On top of that, service is very friendly and the space is nice (nice enough to sit all day with a book) with a small area for your kids to play while you enjoy lunch too. My advice? Go for lunch (they close for dinner), get dessert and take a look at their little store upstairs after (they sell things like the Vitamix, Raw Cacao, Chia Seeds, the Zucchini Pasta maker and much more!)",

    "text": "At the heart of TLC menu is RAW Food or RAW-Fusion Food. It uses no red meat, no cow dairy, no white sugar, no preservatives, no additives, no artificial colorings and include gluten free alternatives. So if you are quick to spot the (loop)holes, this place is not entirely vegan, as it serves things like salmon and goat cheese.Starters were the hand-cut Sweet Potato Wedges ($4) that were earthy and good. Lightly baked with olive oil, it did not had the tempting smell of fries from fast food outlets but an alluring scent of coriander seeds. Some might find it rather firm but these were perfect for napping in the home-made mayonnaise (made of cashew nut milk, lemon juice, water, olive oil and salt but no egg yolks.)Follow that up with TLC cheese burger ($15): a dehydrated patty of portobello mushrooms, almonds and sunflower seeds, topped with tomatoes, sprouts and romaine lettuce. I stared in disbelief at the bun-less burger as those burgers from the opposite tables had buns and cheese.Though the mushroom patty had a robust aroma, it was tough and dry, not aided by an unidentified bland orange sauce Wished it was a simple grilled Portobello mushroom with garlicky herbs. But there were good things like the Mexican-inspired Raw Taco Boats ($12). My trepidations of greasy wheat glutens dissipated when the two large sized mock meat turned out to be made of dehydrated walnuts. The light guacamole and mango salsa sauce had a touch of Indian flavors, probably because this dish used similar spices such as cumin. \u00a0While the savoury food were wholesome, it was the RAW desserts that blown us away. Each had their own merits and everyone declared our own favourite item. I love the Raw Dark German Chocolate Cake ($8.50) made with Dates, Zucchini, Coconut oil, Cacao Powder, Irish Moss Honey and Macadamia. It was compact and chocolatey, not too sweet despite a toffee-lookalike honey layer on top. The shards of fragrant toasted coconuts were a bonus.As for the Raw Blueberry Cheesecake($8.50)made with coconut oil, agave, cashew and lemon juice, we could not be bothered by the alien-sounding ingredients such as psyllium husk, soy lecithin, Irish moss, as we dived straight into the delicate mousse and crunchy base. A bit of sweet and a bit of summer fruity flavours, we did not miss the sharp tang of cream cheese.Tiramisu (actually we all did) \u00a0was made of natural coffee extract and sitted on chalky and fragile almond-flour cake base. This is literally an authentic tiramisu sans the fats from Mascarpone Cheese and Raw Egg Yolks (Yes, tiramiusu is made of raw eggs too). And who says tiramisu must have the alcohol to taste good? Honestly, I left the place feeling more satisfied than I had expected (perhaps it's due to eating \"Real Food\" ). However, the fact that nearly every dish were full of (grinded) NUTS, drove me nuts a little. Perhaps I would still pick Indian/Chinese style vegetarian food from Raj Restaurant over TLC. \u00a0That said, don't leave without trying TLC's desserts which had not been compromised on flavours. Hoping that they can satisfy my sweet tooth while bring less harm to my health, I happily dabao (takeaway) more items home",

    "text": "Let me start off by first saying that I'm a red-blooded, meat-eating American who was just looking for a healthy change for a weekend brunch. I usually can't get too full from just eating vegetables and had to order a number of items to feel satisfied here.We started with the living cafe roll, which contained an assortment of fresh vegetables, wrapped in daikon sheets and had two splotches of different sauces on the nicely-presented sides of our plate. While clearly fresh and juicy (and the creaminess of the avocado was a good complement to the fresh peppers and lettuce), I feel like the sauces needed to be either thicker or just marinated into the vegetables-- as I needed to dip my pieces several times to get a flavorful bite. And because there's no real binding agent, the pieces also fall apart fairly easily, unless you put a whole piece into your mouth-- which can be a bit challenging.On the other hand, the raw zucchini lasagne was flavorful and fresh, but a bit small in its portion.I also ordered the acai kickstart, which was a very tasty balance of bananas, oats, honey and acai-- until you ate past the top inch and are left a bland layer of with frozen acai filling up the bottom 2/3 of the cup.Because I still wasn't full after the three orders, we also had the poached fresh salmon-- which has pieces as small as you'd find in sushi nigiri and was clean and unsalted-- and the hand-cut sweet potato wedges-- which were huge potato segments (they used both the traditional orange sweet potato, along with a purple variety) that were pretty decently fried, without being oily.The flat white coffee with soy milk is pretty decent (although they had run out of the hazelnut milk that we had initially wanted to try).Overall, I wasn't a huge fan of the place, but I think that it lives up to its concept and will please raw foodists and other healthy living enthusiasts in Singapore.Very nice, casual atmosphere too with very clean, polished setup. The crowd seemed to consist of a lot of Caucasian mothers who took/take prenatal yoga classes.",

    "text": "Surprised with this find! Very healthy food and it tastes pretty damn good too. I'm not a fan of vegetable but consume them for the vitamins and fibre. Had the zucchini pasta, it is made entirely of zucchini and has some alfalfa sprouts as garnish. Looks great and tastes refreshing but since it's cold it can take some getting used to. For those craving something warm, go for the sweet potato wedges! Highly recommended. We had the chocolate ganache tart too but the taste of coconut overpowered any taste of chocolate but presentation was flawless. Will be coming back for more! Service was pretty good especially the female waitress I had. Friendly with a smile! About $48 for 2 zucchini pastas, 1 sweet potato wedges, 1 chocolate ganache tart, 1 flat white coffee with hazelnut milk and 1 puri tea.",

    "text": "This place is quite interesting. It's an eatery under a wellness center. They provides fruit and veggie juices with ingredients that are hard to come by in many healthy restaurants I've been to. They have juices with coconut water, goji berries, cilantro, wheatgrass, etc., but they also add supplements to some of their juices like Vitamineral green, lecithin, maca powder, etc. Their smoothies and shakes are vegan, made with nut or rice milk, a refreshing change if you want to cut dairy out of your diet. The food menu, however, is not 100% vegetarian. They have chicken and fish on the menu from what I remember. The night I went, I had the TLC roll and the TLC Cheeseburger, both of which are vegetarian. The roll did have homemade mayo so I'm not sure if its totally vegan, but the quality of the ingredients are definitely very good. The price sort of matches that, reasonable. I paid $40 for a fruit and veggie juice, a roll, the cheeseburger and a vegan/gluten free chocolate cake.This place also sells supplements, tools to make things at home like a nut milk bag, mason jars and the like, as well as ingredients like salt, vanilla extract, palm sugar, etc. Not gunna lie though, those items were expensive and I know that I can get these same items for cheaper back in the states or even in other shops in Singapore.",

    "text": "It's my first experience with RAW food andI went in really raw and clueless about what it is all about. Don't worry, they don't expect you to dine a la neanderthal style, bloody meat and all. The raw part comes from the emphasis on raw vegan cuisine, no dairy or meat products, food cooked below 48deg Celsius. It's all quite healthy really and of course the food would preserve more of the vitamins and nutrients when it's not overheated. What I had was a special kiwi menu created by The Living Cafe but that kinda gave us the idea how food is prepared here. A lot of nuts are used, in making dehydrated crackers and tart base. It gives it a crunchy texture which I like. If you have allergies, pray stay away.There are also cooked food available and different cuisines as well. Italian and Thai are among them. It's not that intimidating trying raw food and I think TLC makes it really easy for you to forget its even raw in the first place. Do give it a try. TLC is part of the Balanced Living Asia group located at the same compound. You can find out more about the benefits of RAW food here.",

    "text": "My only conclusion as to why this cafe is rated almost 4* on Yelp vs the sub par experience I had on Saturday was this: \u00a0the standards for service are low and people are desperate for a semblance of raw/vegetarian food that they will overlook a lot of shortcomings.I live in the area and have driven past the Living Cafe and it looked like a place I should try because I enjoy eating clean and I am willing to pay higher prices for quality (and some serenity even). My better half is also a gluten-free eater. Well I walked in on a Saturday morning and there was one table occupied. No one greeted me and so I figured I'll just sit down and wait for service. 20 minutes later I was still ignored while another party came in, sat at the table at the back of the cafe and was waited on immediately. I also observed the same for the next two tables that walked in. The cynical part of me would say maybe I wasn't the right skin color, but nice let's-give-them-the-benefit-of-doubt side would argue maybe the service just is bad.So I got myself a menu and managed to order my food by getting one waiter's attention. Service was better from there as said waiter was efficient in delivering the food, but that's about it. I ordered the granola crunch bowl, pancakes and vegetarian omelet. When the food came, I got the same surprise I had a few months ago at the other cafe down the street, the LITTLE diner. Yup folks, small portions for not so small prices. And it was not like I was eating anything particularly unique or outstanding. The pancakes were on the rubbery side with a *sprinkle* of blue and strawberries and a sparse drizzle of what tasted like honey. The omelet was tasty and went well with the multi-grain bread but again, I felt kind of ripped off because this was easily something my mum could make, bigger and for cheaper.I guess this places is a convenient snack place after yoga class but I really wouldn't make the effort to eat here otherwise. Onaka, 7 Sensations and even Whole Earth offer much better value considering the creativity that's put into reinterpreting dishes, the portions and the quality of ingredients.",

    "text": "If there's one thing exceptional about my palette, it's the fact that I don't like vegetables. Nadda, not one vegetable. There is no exception, I might eat the occasional veg if I'm too lazy to pick it out of my noodles and its soft, but otherwise, I really don't like vegetables. Something about the texture and taste as a whole.So for me to visit a place that specializes in raw vegan food... definitely an experience.Eating uncooked food is quite an acquired taste - I am Chinese and I like my food hot, thank you very much. There was a raw mushroom soup I attempted - think uncooked mushrooms pureed into soup-like texture akin to Gazpacho with a really strong raw mushroom smell. I only managed one scoop of that. There are also raw pizzas and raw pastas (it's sliced up zucchini!), and even cakes for those who like this sorta thing.Thankfully, there are options for the less refined palettes, I had a cooked pizza with a mysterious \"cheesy\" sauce, inverted commas and all. While cooked, it was healthier with a whole wheat base that reminded me of digestive biscuits, but overall quite yummy.Raw vegan food does come at a price though - the portions are not very big but the prices are still the pricey bistro sort. Also, make sure you have time because the food is all freshly prepared and takes quite awhile to come.",

    "text": "I LOVE that they have a raw food menu as well as a gluten free menu! \u00a0These are two concepts that are ridiculously challenging to find in Singapore, and I commend the Living Cafe for having put in the effort on both fronts. \u00a0Having moved to Singapore from Los Angeles where gluten-free and raw food restaurants are aplenty, I must admit that the food at Balanced Living is lacking a bit of creativity. \u00a0Their raw pizza is nothing more than a salad atop a flax crust. \u00a0The salad menu is much smaller than I would expect from a health food restaurant. \u00a0The raw zucchini pesto pasta is quite nice. \u00a0Their raw desserts really do hit the mark: \u00a0raw cheesecake, raw german chocolate cake, raw chocolate mud pie, raw apple pie, raw chocolates, raw spirulina balls, \u00a0etc. \u00a0 I like that they actually do have meat as an option. \u00a0My husband loves coming here because he can still get a \"real meal\" while I enjoy my raw food!Hopefully more people will go to the Living Cafe and they will be able to both grow and refine the menu a bit!",
