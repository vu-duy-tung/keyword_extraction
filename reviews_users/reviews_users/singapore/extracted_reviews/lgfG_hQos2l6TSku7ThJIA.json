    "text": "Back to homely brunos for dinner, starting the night with burrata followed by their al granchio and tiramisu for dessert. Food was awesome as always. Had 2 moscatos and 1 Merlot to go with our meal. Final bill came up to S$130 (blame the Burrata - it's S$40 but worth every dollar :p ) They might want to do something about the service though. The common feedback about that young waitress who doesn't speak a word and basically walked around with no emotions on her face - I'm totally with the Yelp community on this. But shout out to Shawn S who left the comment 3 months ago that \"this is Singapore so it's probably expected that the waitress doesn't speak English\" - you might be surprised to know that Singapore has a bilingual education policy and English is our first language. Wow mind blown. A little research before visiting a country doesn't hurt. But ANYWAY.. Yes even if she does talk, it's barely audible which is really frustrating when I just wanted to make sure somebody gets my order in and right. This experience wouldn't stop me from going back to brunos though.",

The waitress we had spoke so softly that I could barely hear her and had to keep asking her to repeat what she said. We had to ask them to serve us bread while other customers who arrived after us were already served.The ambience is nice as it gives a homely feel to the restaurant but that's as far as I would go in terms of anything that was outstandingly positive about this place.We ordered the carpaccio, lasagna, arrabiata, and bruschetta. Carpaccio was fine, the lasagna a tad too sweet, arrabiata tasted like a sugar syrup, and the bruschetta was made with cherry tomatoes again making it very sweet. I have never seen a bruschetta prepared with cherry tomatoes in my life.For all that, the damage was $120 for 2 people, and we didn't even have wine. For the prices, I would rather go to Osteria Mozza where the pasta is guaranteed quality and will probably cost you the same.This place seems very popular with the locals and that's great, but for me, this was well below par and I'm being generous with my rating.",

The noodles had enough garlic to put Buffy out of a job, I couldn't even finish it. The best part was the wine and it was just enough to get a few sips before it was gone.

But Bruno's has us coming back repeatedly.The staff treats us well, and there are always enticing specials and solid pizza pies. It's hard to pick a favourite pizza, but if I had to choose, I'd go for the rucola (Parma ham, shredded parmesan and arugula/rocket.) Not into pizzas? Their pastas are worth trying. On my last visit, I tried the mushroom ravioli and it rocked my socks off.Don't forget their appetizers, though! We always order their beef carpaccio, and if we're hungry enough, we'll do bruschetta. Bruno himself is usually on the premises; if he's not, he's most likely at his other outlet on Telok Kurau. Our last visit was also when we learned that he isn't Italian- apparently, he's French! All this time, we seriously thought he was Italian. *Mind blown*",

Everything was cooked to perfection.We were first served with a basket of warm, toasty bread which was nice. A tip? ask for butter. Mmmmm mmmmm mmmm!The pasta was al dente, aglio olio wasn't oily, the sauce was perfect.The pizza was topped with lots of cheese, big chunks of pineapple and lots of ham. The crust wasn't too thin like a biscuit, neither was it thick - it was just nice. As for the mushroom soup, it wasn't too garlicy or creamy.Portion:Perfect. They weren't stingy on anything at all! For example, they didn't skimp on the amount of pasta provided unlike other places.Atmosphere:Very nicely furnished and there's a sense of authenticity to it.Service:Mostly older workers which was nice to see! They were efficient and friendly. Food came out really fast.Price:A bit pricey but for the serving size and the quality, it's definitely worth it!Others:It was full when we arrived so if you've got a big crowd, i would recommend making a reservation!Overall, I really loved this place. They would definitely be seeing more of me! ;)",

I love the general crabmeat toppings cooked in that salmon pink sauce topped with basil leaves. Cooked al dente, this dish is a delight to have. If you are a truffle oil fan, have the stuffed ravioli. Can't remember if it's stuffed with foie gras but each piece was very satisfying, especially in the creamy truffle sauce.The pizzas are also pretty good. Want some hearty Italian in the East?

    "text": "Bruno, you have created an Italian masterpiece in the heart of Katong! The Italian food is jaw droppingly good. The restaurant itself is cozy and simply designed, essentially everything you would want in classic Italian Style trattoria. \u00a0Everything from the appetizer, to the main course, to the dessert is simply wonderful. For Appetizer, I usually go with my usual Beef Carpaccio. Bruno's Beef Carpaccio comes with a healthy serving of Rocket and Parmesan cheese. It has a more lemon, zesty taste than others I know, which i absolutely love. \u00a0The pastas, in my view, are the true winners of this restaurant. I've tried two pastas thus far (i) the Linguine Al Granchi Creama - Linguine with tomato basil sauce and shredded crab meat and (ii) the linguine with scallops. Honestly, I can't tell which one is my favorite. The Linguine with tomato basil sauce and shredded crab meat is most likely an ode to the flavours of Singapore, and not necessarily italian. The texture of the sauce is like the chili sauce found in Jumbo Seafood's Chili Crab. I know its a crazy comparison, but I always find it difficult to describe texture in prose. In terms of taste, its clearly different, with a more tomato/basil like finish. There is also a healthy serving of sauce (not overpowering), but enough to fill you up. As for the linguine with scallops, its a classic tomato based pasta and just as good as the former. Bruno doesn't scrimp on the scallops, providing 5-8 large scallops in the dish, which almost dwarfs the linguine itself. The scallops are generally fresh, except for one, which I decided to leave to alone. As for the Pizza, if you like thinner crust pizza's, this the place for you. Since I'm not much of a Pizza guy, I'd refer to my fellow yelpers for their pizza experience. My wife and I topped off the dinner with a simple yet beautiful molten lava cake and vanilla cream with a sprinkling of pistachio and strawberry. Yes, its the molten lava cake, which you cut into and the chocolate just spews out. Overall, this restaurant easily gets five-stars, in my view. The food is fantastic. The prices are affordable ($20-25 for pasta) and the atmosphere is one I would describe as cozy and neighborly. Most of all, this restaurant reminds me of the great Trattorias I used to frequent on Arthur Ave in the Bronx, NY (arguably the best Italian restaurants in NYC). I can't think of any better local business that I would write my 100th review than Brunos!",

Great food, good service, nice bustly vibe, great great desserts, friendly Chef, and somewhat simple-not in your face design?What I Love: Their food. My fave is the Squid Ink pasta with Squid Ink Sauce. Have tried the Crayfish Pink Pasta, and their starters are great too. Portions are HUGE here so share or prepare for a food coma - Italian Style. Their Beef Carpacio, Calamari Platter or the Mixed Platter (Fruitti Di Mare Fritto), and Mozzarella Di Bufala, Fish Fillet Frittos, Bruschetta and Prosciutto are excellent options.For mains, apart from Pasta, their Pizzas are great too. Again, portions are ridic. Their salad is yummmy. Risotto options are fab too. Try the one with seafood and tomato sauce.For desserts, their Panna Cotta, Cream Caramel, and Tiramisu are great options.They've got great wine options - and I usually have a coffee or Limoncello to wash everythin' down. My fave Italian place in Singapore. Not chain stuff and not too commercial.What I Don't Love: That they have 2 seatings - a 6:30pm to 8:30pm and 8:30pm to 10:30pm slot. So, you gotta choose one. I prefer takin' the later slot - so I can take my time.",

Parking is definitely hard to find and along this stretch so make sure you head over earlier if you are driving. I would also suggest making a booking if you are going there on a weekend as it does get quite full up after 7pm.There was a great selection to choose from and I was pleased with or starters. The bread was freshly baked themselves, and the olive oil served was of good quality. I enjoyed the beef carpaccio had fresh rocket leaves and real cheese flakes. It was very enjoyable!We tried a pizza and it was perfectly done, with a thin, crispy crust, and the perfect ratio of parma ham, cheese and rockets. The tomato based sauces tasted very authentic and complex, and they are very generous with their portions - the spaghetti bolognaise is especially hearty. However, I found the truffle dishes far too creamy and rich and did could not stomach the entire plate when I ordered it as my main.Service here was efficient, but not always attentive. The food arrived quite quickly and I did feel a little rushed. They have a good selection of wines here to pair with your food, so do ask the waiters for recommendations if you aren'y that familiar with their wines!",

The Caesar Salad was good--very strong flavors. Fortunately I love anchovies. The beef carpaccio was excellent, but a little too much rocket. Pasta was a little overdone but not bad. Bolognese was average (better the next day) and the vodka sauce was pleasant, but nothing to jump up and down about. A pretty hefty price for three people coming in at $210!

    "text": "very good italian family-style trattoria in the food wonder that is katong. we've gotten in the habit of prowling katong hunting for new restaurants to try post-dinner, which is how we happened upon bruno's - and it was a good thing we did.the food is great - good ingredients, large portions, strong flavors - and the atmosphere of the place is as lovely as you'd want: there's a certain coziness that comes with the patronage of clearly-regular customers who banter with wait staff and rambunctious children that properly create that rather indescribable something that makes an italian establishment.we had soups (alright), pastas (the squid ink pasta with tomato was great, as was a crabmeat linguine), beef (the rib-eye, pink in the middle and char-marked outside), and a pizza (a pepporoni topped meat-lover's delight with an airy bready crust). the best thing was the day's special of mussels, cooked in white wine - plump and juicy and so delicious.it was also a really good meal - not inexpensive, but competitively-priced (and likely a good deal considering the portions), the wait staff kept the food coming and our glasses filled, and I really enjoyed how family-friendly it was.great for informal, belly-busting dinners - a fantastic find.",

    "text": "Best kept secret in east coast region! The pizza is the best I've had in Singapore, without a question (and I've eaten a lot!). I recommend the bruschetta---so, so nice. You can't go wrong with the pastas...try the crab meat or squid...a little spicy but not overpowering. The service is a little slow at times...they try their best, but they seem to get preoccupied with all the orders that they forget to check up on patrons during the meal. The food is so good, however, that I don't mind.",

    "text": "Had lunch with the sisters for a catch up and decided to give Bruno's a try. While there was a lunch menu, we decided to go a la carte and try the menu offerings. I had such a tough time deciding from the wide variety of awesomeness but eventually, we over ordered and I had realllllly good gnocchi. You should enquire about the daily specials and that's how I got my gnocchi after changing my orde rfor the umpteen time. The owner's a really nice guy, who greeted us and enquired if the food's okay. We pair a fair price of $25 per pax and would deffo go back for pizza which we forgot to order!",
