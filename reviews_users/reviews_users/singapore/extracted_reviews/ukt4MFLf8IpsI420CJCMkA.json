Atmosphere is a plus but it's not something that one needs all the time. La Petite offers you great French food at reasonable price in a casual setting where you can just be yourself.You don't need to go to a fancy restaurant for great French cuisine, cos La Petite offers it all. We had the lamb rack and it was truly divine. Flavourful seasoning, right char and overall great taste. Located not too far away from the Botanical gardens, one can even take a slow walk after the meal and continue to reflect on the meal.",

In the same spirit as the supermarkets: Spartan d\u00e9cor; order and pay upfront at the cashier's; reasonable pricing (except for wine). This used to be THE place where to get cheap French food in Singapore. It has since been surpassed on all fronts by the Saveur chain, which has similar pricing, but offers more convenient locations, service, and most importantly, more diverse and better-quality good.",

Again, it could use some spice and they don't have tabasco sauce or any chili available. Ambience is nice though.=====================================Second visit 21 Feb 2017Spaghetti w/ fresh crab meat in lightly spicy tomato sauce ($16.50) - 4 starsA hefty amount of fresh crab meat and a PILE of spaghetti. I wanted to but stopped myself from finishing this thankfully. Even then I definitely had no room for island creamery next door! The flavor was good but not as spicy as I would've liked. There's something missing - similar to their duck confit above - that makes the food short of 5 stars. I can't quite put my finger on it but it tastes more like good comfort food than fine dining. It would be nice if the male server was friendlier... because I'm paying with the entertainer app I really am not bothered, but if I were paying full price I would think twice before heading here.Salmon with spinach and rice ($17.50) - 4.25 starsThe salmon was excellent! Light and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. The portion was fairly small though - especially the 3 leaves of spinach - so my plus one was left a little hungry (perfect because he helped me with my dish!)=====================================First visitDuck confit canard ($17.50) - 4 starsLoved the crispy skin and the meat was tender. They also gave a MOUND of potato gratin. It had too much butter for me so the next time I'm going to try asking for salad instead.Update: they'll do a salad for an additional $1! Worth it.Cute cosy place, and best of all we could use the entertainer app!",

    "text": "La Petite Cuisine serves a decent French Cuisine, authentic and unpretentious. They are humbly situated in one of the old school malls in Bukit Timah Area and are known for its affordability and quality.By chance, we were there on one of the weekday nights and decided to give it a try since we have pass by the place so many times and the crowd in the restaurant was rather convincing.Furnishing was not really modern but still presentable in its own style. They have black board mounted on to the \"bricks-lookalike\" tiles indicating the specials serving of the day.Without looking much into their ala carte menu, we decided on the Weekday Set dinner at $24 which we thought was pocket friendly as there is no GST and service charge. Plain water are self-service and are reachable from the drinks counter. The dinner \u00a0set is rather straight forward with 2 choices of appetizer, mains and desserts each.Getting the best of both worlds we order 2 sets and tried everything for the set dinner during that day.My first try of Orange Carrot Soup was pleasing, it tasted sweet more than of a citrus taste that I would have expected. They were served tongue burning hot and goes indeed well dipping the mini baguettes.The stomach comforting Ravioli of spinach among the light creamy sauce was a good reminisce of my France trip. The straight forward dish without much fanciful creations in the dish is somehow what I'm looking for. Decent and down to earth.One of the set was served with rice, spinach and Salmon Filet in cream sauce. Cream sauce is light and taste is identical to what was being used in the Ravioli dish. Salmon was cooked perfectly with crispy skin and pinkish on the inside.Comparing this main course to the salmon, I would have prefer this dish more. The steak was chewy and tender. The mushroom sauce reveals some hints of wine in it gave a perfect match to the Sirlion Steak. The stomach fillers in the dish will be the potato grains.The wobbly panna cotta as our desserts was a sweet ending to the meal. I don't have a sweet tooth, thus the caramelized top layer isn't really for me.Overall, La Petite Cuisine is a commendable place and for sure I will recommend to my friends who wants to have some authentic french cuisine without breaking the pocket.",

    "text": "I was told not to expect good service but just to enjoy the food. So I went not expecting much. The place was really tiny! It was not a proper restaurant with a shop shell. Instead the kitchen/cashier counter seemed to take up the entire proper shop space, so the tables were actually outside that space. Quite a strange layout as it looked like people could just enter and walk through to get inside Serene Centre.With just 5-6 small tables inside, they really cannot accommodate big groups or take reservations. I think once people realize that, they will not and should not expect the restaurant to accede to their requests.Maybe we were lucky but the service was good when we were there. At 1pm on a Saturday afternoon, only a few tables were occupied, so we were able to get a table immediately. We were greeted in French by the French chef-owner who was sitting by the door. He was a bit quirky caustic with a bit of mischievous fun, very French, when interacting with the diners. Definitely not those amiable and super friendly chefs in other family style restaurants. We were given the menu, and complimentary warm crusty rolls with butter were served shortly after we placed our order at the cashier. The bread was fabulous, very fresh and set the tone for the hearty meal. Water was available near the cashier, self serve. Specials of the day were posted on the board at the cashier. I had the beef bourguignon which was the best I ever tasted in Singapore. It did not have the burnt bovril taste. The stew had a natural beefiness and smooth finish, with melt in your mouth meat. I did not need to use the knife at all. It came with a bowl of al dente spaghetti which was generously coated with butter (I think) so it was quite tasty on its own. The duck confit was divine. The skin was super crispy and the meat was tender juicy. It came with creamy potatoes which were just so good. I would go back again, just to try the other dishes. It is only opened for lunch and dinner.",

Finally decided to try the restaurant in its larger fully air-conditioned premises.I was amazed at the food this restaurant churned out, despite my typical \"too salty\" complaint of French food. We had onion and carrot with orange soups. Great except the saltiness :). The Magret de Canard (duck breast) in honey thyme sauce tasted very very good despite the breast a bit too over-cooked in certain portions. Rounded off the meal with the apple tarte which was also fantastic (needed 30mins prep time). Wonderful tasting French food in good proportions. Just ignore the unpretentious setting of plastic plates and cheap plastic table linings. To complete the atmosphere, drinks are served in plastic cups.Definitely coming back again",

This ordering circus seemed to have no rhyme or reason, and some of the more chaos-averse would-be diners were visibly exasperated and I think just gave up and left.The food is good and comparatively cheap. We had the dory and the scallops. The scallops were better, but also twice as expensive. The salad and soup were good and really cheap. They only had one of the desserts which were listed on the menu. We went on a Sunday and there was a legitimate French chef, as in a big white guy with a thick French accent, so they get some street cred also.",

The cream is tastefully prepared, the specialty mushrooms burst with saut\u00e9ed goodness, the meat is always tender and slightly undercooked (sometimes) to preserve the flavour (because that's how they do it!).Prices are on the fun side (just above $10 for a main), the checkered tablecloths are cute and the crockery is pretty basic, in order to keep prices down for our enjoyment, and I feel bad for not coming here often enough.

When I asked to make a reservation for a big group of people, he said there's no reservation possible. That's ok. I then asked the capacity to judge how long the wait might be if I have to go since I've never been there and he said 1,000.. I asked how long the wait might be, he said it's busy on weekends and that's why they don't take reservations. I asked what time might be a good time to get there so we don't have to wait, he said 5.30pm. I've called many restaurants before, and this is the worst service I've ever received on the call. If you want to be annoyed for the day, give La Petite Cuisine a call. If not for the fact that my friend really wants to try this restaurant, I will not give it the time of day. Good food is one thing, but rude service cannot rectify for any kind of good food that is being served. There's plenty of other amazing restaurants with great service that deserves to make that money off you!",

    "text": "Have been here quite a few times now and never been disappointed - very good french food at really reasonable prices.My favourite used to be their delicious salmon-stuffed penne in cream sauce, which was one of the cheapest items on their menu, yet one of their most unique. I was thus fairly upset on my latest visit when I found out that they had taken it off their menu.What better to commiserate this loss than with a wonderful plate of foie gras with a sort of orange compote, served with such a generous side of salad. The foie gras was wonderfully pan-fried so it melts in your mouth - so smooth on the inside, while maintaining a thin and crisp membrane to hold the goodness in. The sweet orange compote was the perfect complement - not overwhelmingly sweet, and tangy enough to be unexpectedly tasty. I then had a duck confit canard as my main, because this dish has rarely failed me. It was slightly disappointing this time because the meat didn't peel off as tenderly as I'd expected it too, though the skin was still well crispy. The duck is served with a crispy and creamy potato gratin - so very satisfying I always wipe my plate clean. I've also had the escargot in a croissant before, which was quite an unusual experience as I had always pictured escargots to be in little pots soaked with garlic and oil, so this was quite different, having almost no scent of either. This was therefore rather refreshing, and I really enjoyed it, though maybe the escargot was a little overcooked when I had it.",

So I've only ever gone on a Saturday, where it is essential to go early or else wait (or split a big party), and it's always been a hoot--the service staff are brisk but will flirt with you when they're less busy, and so will Mr Chef when he's finally done cooking for the night. It's that sort of neighbourhood place. What I like to eat there: chicken liver salad (happiest memory of that trip to Paris), duck confit (perfect if they made it with crispy rather than creamy potatoes!). They also have an Alsatian platter of sausages and sauerkraut, if you want something a bit different. Think of it as French food made accessible through the casual location and the more casual prices.And save room for ice cream at the Island Creamery next door. ;-)",
