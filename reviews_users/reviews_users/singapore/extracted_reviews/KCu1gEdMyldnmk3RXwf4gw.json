The prices are usually about 1/3-1/2 of the Orchard Road food court prices. The foods are super tasty. Some of them are receiving good raves from the locals as well. Always look for a long queue line.",

It was very convenient to be able to cross the street and hit up a local hawker center without having to travel all the way to Chinatown. Food was DELICIOUS. Honestly, I don't speak the language so I usually just went where everyone else was in line for and chose something randomly. Everything I tried was delicious and on point.",

I went out for jog and accidentally found this food center...some food venders we're open at 7 and they have great meals for very small amount of money. I had some noodle with squid and fried fish for $4SG. Wow. And it tasted really awesome. With $.50 coffee from another vender I was full and ready for the day. During the the lunch hour you will see a lot of tourists here as many Tour buses parked nearby. But during breakfast it's all locals.",

    "text": "Missing your bulk bins at Whole Foods? This is the place to go. On the 3rd floor of this building are a bunch of little shops selling various dry goods out of giant bags. I come here for the nuts -- almonds, cashews, pistachios -- which sell at a lower price than at the grocery store, and are way fresher. You can even ask for a sample before buying. I favor the more crowded stores, which have a higher turnover. The shop assistant will fill the bags for you, so it's somewhat sanitary despite not having pulldown dispensers.There are also other local snacks, like those little fried shrimp rolls, seaweed rice crackers, spicy tapioca chips, selling for less than at your nearby supermarket. Best of all, they are available year round, not just during Chinese New Year. This is where I head to buy snacks when I visit people in other countries. Besides snacks, they also sell other dried Chinese goods like mushrooms, sea cucumbers, oysters, pickled vegetables, but I don't really go for those. With so many stores side by side, I'm sure the prices are competitive. The food center on the first floor has a good variety of local food, and tends to have more stalls open during the day than at night.4 stars, coz I don't like the messy surroundings.",

But I won't suggest to make a trip just to eat here.The usual food stall that you can try out all local food with the local people.I was here one morning for breakfast which I had a great experience as the place was not crazily busy and I can find seating. But when I came back on a Sunday afternoon around 3 pm, the place was just packed! I can barely even work around and check out the stalls.There is a lot of older folks hanging out here... I guess if this is your crowd, Albert Centre is a good place to hang!",

The vegetable stall has got very fresh produce and there's a little old lady who sells nice fat chickens. I also like the butcher at the end of the row - run by a nice couple who always have good stuff on offer. And everything is always reasonably priced - cheaper than cold storage for sure. The cooked food market is da bomb. Always bustling and filled with really good stalls. My fav are the Queen Street Prawn Noodles and the economic bee hoon stalls for an artery clogging brekkie.",

Unfortunately the fans aren't very powerful so it is pretty darn hot (in my opinion) inside the hawker center. Luckily, there are quite a few stalls selling cold drinks. Definitely have a walk around first to see what stalls interest you before looking for a table.Note: There is a few sinks near the entrance (mid section of the hawker) where you can wash your hands.",

Along with the usual clothing, shoes, bags and what not, there are some trinkets and giveaways that you can purchase as well.Week before the New Year, I came here with the intent to purchase a lucky charm for my mom and dad as a present. The sales associate was very helpful to me in searching for the perfect gift for them. And she was nice to also fit the price with my budget. They didn't sell me items just for the sake of making a sale, they made sure that I absolutely loved the items they suggested before the haggling began. Bargain shopping can be a fun and fulfilling experience. Especially when the sales people work hand in hand with you in order to get the perfect item at its best price.",
