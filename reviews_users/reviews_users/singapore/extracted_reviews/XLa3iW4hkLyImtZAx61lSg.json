    "text": "This Australian bistro is a little gem hidden away in the Goodman Arts Centre (GAC) - it opens up to a green field, and combined with the high ceilings, glass panels and wooden decor give it a warm and inviting feeling where you feel you can sit and chill out the entire afternoon.The menu is quite extensive - there's all-day breakfasts, along with your requisite starters, main courses, pizzas, sarnies (that's sandwiches for the non-aussies). My table had the Eggs Benedict with bacon or salmon (both yum), the portobello mushroom stack with a pasta side (also good), and a 12-inch personal pizza baked in their on-site wood fire kiln! My favourite bit would be desserts, which are not on the menu but displayed on the counter for you to pick. That day we had a lovely decadent chocolate cake that came with additional berries and cream... super rich and awesome! For the thirsty, the caffeine addicts in my group pronounced the Cafe Melba cuppa good, and there's quite a long list of alcoholic drinks for you to sip and wind down to at the end of the day. All in all this bistro is a welcome addition to GAC, and makes a great option when one is a little too lazy or the weather is too insane to head out to the hawker centres nearby.P/S: Cafe Melba has a special Neighbours card with discounts and perks for its fellow tenants at GAC... check with the staff to find out more!",

Truffle fries were delish -- we devoured them once they finally arrived... ... which leads me to why the 3 stars. Service is TERRIBLE. Terrible! Our server couldn't remember our orders. When they arrived, they came at widely different times. One got left off completely, and we had to wait another 20 minutes for it. It was a gong show. Great wine list. We had lots of that. :)The atmosphere is lovely -- being able to sit outside with fans, in front of a green space, and listen to music wafting in from nearby studios -- all really comfortable and relaxed.I just wish the service wasn't so relaxed. It's the one thing that needs a kick in the pants.",

The hollandaise was just how I liked it, accenting the eggs but not overwhemingly heavy.

    "text": "okayish australian brunch food hidden away in the goodman arts centre. this place has drawn mixed reviews since opening this year - and I'm about to toss my own undecided judgement into the mix, just so you have as difficult a time as I did of deciding if it's worth visiting.on second thought, perhaps that's not the best strategy for ingratiating myself into your favor. so here's it straight up: this place has great potential, but the food and service are in firm not-travel-worthy-but-I'll-have-it-if-it's-there territory. or more succinctly, meh.I admit to wanting to come here for the longest time, despite those reviews: I had seen photos of the gorgeous space in design blogs, and there's just something incredibly appealing about good lighting for photography.but the place doesn't look nearly this good (one day I will learn to stop trusting photos) in the daytime - and there was this slight ramshackle shabbiness about it, like they hadn't bothered to take care of what should be a well-curated space.the pizzas fared the best that day, hands down. we had the chili crab, mushroom and a trifecta of meat products on the three little pigs. these were well-cooked in a wood-fired oven, with a crust that verged between cracker and thin-crust (nothing nearly as flavorful as the famed mozza - but good in its way), and the ingredients were suitably piled on.the other dishes were less interesting: a burger was stacked high and pretty - and so were the pile of pancakes I ordered, which came in a healthy stack of four and drizzled with compote - and the full melba cooked breakfast was a generous plateful of food. but these suffered from bimboticism, having mastered the art of looking good without much substance.so really, if you're here - head for the pizzas. the other stuff isn't bad, and actually perhaps on par with some hipsterish cafes, but I don't think it's worth traveling for. there is just this pervading sense of unfulfilled potential rather perpetuated also by the sheer nothing-outstanding-ness of both service and food. much better food elsewhere, really.",

However i did manage to try a bit of food at Cafe Melba. I had what can be described as a type of pizza basket. It's clean slices of flour and dough with some meat, vegetable and cheese toppings on it. These pizzas are extremely thin and you may eat them with a choice of 3 sauces that are given to you - pesto, olive and chick peas sauce. The price range is a bit high. The quality of service is pretty good. And the ambience is the best part of the place. They have a very cool outdoor space seating area with wooden benches and tables. They also have pretty excellent coffee. It's a chillout sunday sort of a place for me.",

There was a special event for Chinese New Year and it was fun with Lion Dancing and face painting, arts and crafts, balloons, etc. Brunch is simply a breakfast menu and I was not impressed. I couldn't order a sandwich till 11:00 am so I was disappointed. The bacon was steamed and I felt bad the rest of the day. One piece of toast was not enough and I waited 45 minutes for a second $4.00 piece. Dry, cold and everything else had been consumed. The service was horrible. They were busy--I'll give them that--but the drinks were super slow, the food just average and waiting for the toast infuriating. And, they didn't care. The tip was included in the bill and I tipped more so they got more than average for a bad experience. I will say the people at the restaurant were some of the best looking folks on earth. Lots of ex-pats with about a dozen languages floating around. Eggs, toast, bacon, a breakfast sandwich, two juices and it was $75.",

Unfortunately, it tasted very much like American-Italian - in this case I suppose it'd be Australian-Italian although I haven't had Italian food in Australia. It'd probably be the equivalent of having pasta at Buca Di Beppo in California. I liked that the flavours were strong, but what I enjoyed about the dish ended there. It wasn't refined at all - it tasted heavy and cloying, and not in a good way the way comfort food can be. The ravioli skins were far too thick - imagine fat floury soggy dumpling wrappers - and were stuffed with cheese that was the wrong texture. The hazelnuts also ended up adding to the density of the dish as well, when I could've used some herbs or greens to lighten and freshen the dish.I'm giving it three stars overall because I'd try some of the other (probably non-pasta) dishes if I do go back. Ambience overall was cute, though I can see why another reviewer said it leaned toward ramshackle rather than rustic.",

Tasted pretty horrible and the garnish of half a sliced banana was just sad. Was served with what tasted like cheap syrup rather than a maple sauce or anything remotely nice. Had the rosti as well. Did not add salt at all and the \"poached\" eggs were kinda hard boiled. Nothing was seasoned properly. Kinda disappointing because this was in my memory a great place to eat at. Prices are still high. Ordering system was good and efficient but poorly planned on some tables. The iPad was placed in the middle of 2 diners eating which to me was pretty poor thinking. The floor around me was wet and had food all around telling me that the servers were pretty oblivious to things going on around the restaurant. Pretty sure this does not happen that often here but this particular experience was exceptionally poor. For their prices & the amount of people that were there while I was there at 4pm, they really should have some sort of consistency towards their cooking with a full team of chefs in the kitchen.",

Crab fish Linguine Oh and the list goes on...!A pretty little bistro tucked in a little corner at the Goodman Arts Centre that used to be the basketball court of the Old Lasalle College of the Arts.Besides the mains, diners can look forward to all day brunch and for those who just want a little snack, check out their Carrot Cake. Filled with raisins and walnuts, it's more than just a normal carrot cake! The size is good for 2 to share at $8/slice.Their lychee martini according to a fren who can't resist a glass of good martini thinks its pretty good too. Ok, now I'm really hungry!!",

I went to their new Mediapolis location on a Saturday. It wasn't crowded at all. The decor was fresh with an Australian vibe so quite pretty. However, I don't like the idea of ordering on iPads. There is always some confusion about whether an order was confirmed or not.We ordered a Greek salad and sweet potato fries.The salad too bad at all, perhaps the dressing was a little on the sweet side and there wasn't enough feta to counteract it. I was just disappointed with the choices -very limited. On the other hand, the sweet potato fries came in a generous helping and were pretty tasty.Overall, it was okay. Nothing special.",

The service staff was pretty responsive when I asked why my order took 45 minutes to arrive for a fish and chips. And they serve all the food together, including light snacks and starters. Kitchen size is too small to accommodate capacity. You are also unable to make a reservation in advance so come early especially on weekends.Severely overrated",

    "text": "Cafe Melba is housed in Goodman Arts Centre which would be a challenge for those getting there via public transport. Lucky for us, we drove to get there and parking wasn't a problem.A good number of patrons were mostly families with children and the open field in front of the cafe allowed these toddlers to run around freely and play. We happen to visit the cafe on a Sunday so we had the brunch menu selection. For starters, we ordered the Curried Pumpkin and Corn Soup. As for our main course, my boyfriend who is a fan of steaks, decided to order the Ribeye Steak (200grams) while I went for the Melba Burger. To avoid having our food all at once, we requested for the soup to be served prior to our main course. However, everything was served at once much to our dismay. The soup came with four slices of parmesan naan which was a good attempt at matching the curried soup although, did not compliment it. A simple soft roll would have done the job. On another note, thumbs up to the taste and flavor of the soup. It also looked fantastic and the aroma drew us in even more. The Ribeye Steak that my boyfriend ordered was unfortunately a letdown. He had a choice between the Black Pepper or B\u00e9arnaise sauce which he chose the latter. It tasted good, but did not go well with the Steak. Moreover, his steak was mildly seasoned and unevenly cooked (he ordered medium rare). The shoe string fries on the side tasted better than the star of the dish. It was golden brown, crispy, and flavorful. The steak also came with salad in balsamic vinegar dressing that was light and refreshing.My Melba Burger looked great. Pieces of bacon were stuffed between the buns along with a perfectly cooked medium rare beef patty and home-made relish sauce. It tasted good, but lack the depth in flavor that would have made me crave for more.Service wise, the staff did not pay much attention to us probably due to the influx of customers. We felt that the service was more of a routine to clear out tables for incoming customers rather than to create that service moment that could have left us with a good impression.Overall service aspect made our experience with cafe melba a mediocre one although the food was not bad. It was however not worth the price we paid and we expected a lot more from them. A few minor tweaks especially in the service aspect would have guaranteed my return.",

    "text": "This is a regular Saturday or Sunday brunch location for my family and friends. Specifically because it is so good for kids. A large field for kids to run around in, a sand pit, and their own Bouncy Castle. While it sits next to a busy main road there is a fence keeping the children playing in grass and not traffic. With ample outdoor seating there is always a full patio of parents enjoying some quiet time while the kids run wild. When it is time for the kids to come back and eat they have a reasonable set kids menu that includes drinks and a dessert. Also the menu is a paper placemat with it's own coloring, activities, and colored pencils. I find the food to be good, it isn't the best food in town, but I certainly don't dislike eating here. I have ordered the Chicken Schnitzel burger before and forgotten that it is too much chicken and almost impossible to eat and enjoy. The Burger is good, the wood fired pizza is also good. The price does feel a bit expensive, not outrageous in Singapore but a bit high, worth it for the distracted children though. The service has been good, a variety of wait staff, all who can help you and take your order, things do get a bit slow, but they do get slammed and busy.As I side note, while I have not experienced it, apparently they are more than kids and castles, they have live music and ladies night throughout the week as well. May have to come back here and try it one evening.",

Food-wise was average... not bad but not spectacular.Came here on a weekend morning and had the Full Melba Cooked Breakfast for $25: \u00a02 eggs, pork sausages, bacon, roasted cherry tomatoes, baked beans, mushrooms, hash brown & toast. I was pretty hungry and considered getting the Mega Melba Cooked Breakfast, an upsized version of the Full Melba, which was $36. The Mega Melba doubles the portions of everything but the eggs, and what I really wanted was more eggs, so I stuck with the Full Melba.It says on the menu that you're not allowed to share the Mega Melba, or in their words \"can't be splitted\". That's not very nice... I wonder if they would have a problem with their customers sharing any of the other dishes? Is the Mega Melba too good a deal? If anything it would make their pricing a little more decent as $25 veers on the side pricey for breakfast. They did however provide a glass bottle of water and cups without us having to ask which I thought was nice considering how many cafes these days won't even serve you tap water.Overall, I can see myself coming back if I'm in the area. I don't mind paying a little extra to avoid the crowds.",

For one, you do not ask your customers condescendingly what they are taking pictures for. I believe the actual words were 'What is that for?' While i do not expect special privileges as a food reviewer, basic friendliness should apply to any customer. Plus, the prices are pretty high and this is coming from someone who is willing to pay for brunch. Would i pay this price for food at a restaurant with mediocre ambience and terrible service? Hell no. You shouldn't either.",

Happiness!I prefer ordering a piccolo as its stronger and more aromatic. The glasses for the latte are a little big, so the coffee gets quite weak and diluted. I've got to say, the service here is pretty good! The waitresses seemed a little hesitant and inexperienced, but yet were friendly and polite.Also, when I asked about the latte tasting weak, the barista came over and recommended the piccolo. After that I noticed they only charged me for my first order. When I brought this up, they said the piccolo was on the house as I was unsatisfied with the latte. :)The food here is of good quality! Ive tried the breakfast menu and was very satisfied with the eggs Benedict and big breakfast. Prices are a little steep but take advantage of the promotions on at the moment!Weekday mains charged at 25% off, while on weekends, you get a free coffee when you order a brunch main before 4pm! Not sure when the promo ends but i was just there last week and it was still on!The rib eye sandwich and chicken pesto sandwich were both lovely, nestled inside very yummy bread. However the buns for the Melba burger were a bit too doughy for me, though the ingredients inside we're fresh and the beef patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare juicy delight.Great ambience and it's great for families as there's a large field out front, and I've seen an inflatable bouncy castle on weekends!",

We got two half&halfs - Chilli Crab and Pepperoni as well as Forest Mushroom and Parma Ham with Rocket. The pizzas are the thin crust variety which is perfect for when you're feeling peckish and not wanting to feel too full too quickly. I'd really recommend the Chilli Crab, my Favorite among the lot we chose. Truffle fries were decent, as with the flat whites. Spotted their promotion on margaritas when I was in the Ladies midway through our meal and decided to get a carafe of Strawberry Margarita to ease into the evening. Frozen margarita was a good idea; tangy refreshing and very much welcomed on the palate after too much carbs between two girls. A word of caution for the slow sipper though, frozen beverages doesn't take too kindly to our harsh humid weather so it didn't take too long till we had a quarter of our carafe left with unattractive slush floating on lukewarm pink liquid - and we were seated indoors! Service was attentive and laid back and I wouldn't mind coming around again to try other items off their extensive menu",
