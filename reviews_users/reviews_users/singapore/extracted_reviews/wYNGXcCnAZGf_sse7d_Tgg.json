The place is open to the street and they are working on the sewer, yes the sewer!! I walked to the back and thought I would order, I asked about the menu and just received a retort from a sweaty man, \"NO MENU!!\". The people working in the kitchen looked similarly sweaty and dirty. The kitchen stunk. What a filth hole! Singapoeans have a great deal of pride in the cleanliness of their country; the health authorities are definitely letting one slip here!!!",

I like my prata to have a good doughy bite plus a crispy outer skin and this one is totally it. You can request for fish curry to go with your prata too which is a little more tangy than meaty curry.On weekends, the wait can be quite long. Thank god I don't live near here or I can imagine putting on the pounds. A totally cheap and yummy breakfast for less than $1 for a kosong prata.",

    "text": "Although a relative newbie in the hawker scene, Mr & Mrs Mohgan's Super Crispy Roti Prata have been consistently ranked as one of the top roti prata vendors in Singapore. Manned by the gentle, soft-spoken couple whose eponymous stall is distinguished by its unabating lines, you're happy to wait in a stuffy, old-school coffeeshop that's as dank as it is rank. Because you're ultimately rewarded for your sweaty efforts with a heaping plate of the best prata I've had in a very long time. I'm partial to Egg Prata ($1.40), and these were beautifully crispy, torched with a golden hue, while fluffy and chewy inside. What's most surprising, however, was how little ghee and oil was used; there was hardly a trace of oil left on the plate when I was done.The default curry accompanying pratas is the Dhal Cha, a thick, beany yellow lentil-based curry that the chilli-averse will likely take to. Should you prefer a more meaty or spicier curry, there's the fish or the mutton.",

I booked my accommodation so I could be close to this stall, not even kidding. It's a tiny setup located within a restaurant on Crane Street. Open in the mornings until early afternoon it's a mum and pop stall that makes only prata. A local spot in a quiet part of town. My favourite is the plain prata. I've had it with egg and onion which was good, and also with cheese which I'm pretty sure was Kraft cheese slices. Served alongside curry sauce for dipping, it's a sheer delight. Three prata and coffee with milk (ordered separately through the restaurant) this me back $4.00. My favourite local cheap eat in Singapore and the best prata ever. It's crispy and moreish but not greasy and dense. An absolute must if you're visiting the area.",

If you're having it there, the order guy will write down your order on the clip board and simply say \"Okay, I'll call you.\"Grab a table, order some teh or kopi, and wait. If you can, remember who was in front of you so you have an idea when your order comes up. Don't be surprised if it's been 15 minutes. If the guy wrote down your order, it will come! Also, it'd be good to REMEMBER your order so if he asks for a refresher, you can easily let him know.My wait was fruitful. I got crispy, not-too-greasy prata that filled me up through mid-afternoon, and of course the sauces that came with it were boss.This is the real deal and I will return.",

This is one of our \"go to\" food centres when we're in Singapore because of it's proximity to our lodging with family.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes but Mr and Mrs Moghan's Super Crispy Prata is well worth the wait.Prata is basically an unleavened bread that is expertly flipped near on like a pizza is and moulded until it has many thin layers of pastry, like a croissant. Prata is usually crispy and flaky on the outside, whilst remaining doughy on the inside. It makes a great breakfast, brunch or lunch but I can eat it any time of day and it is so incredibly more-ish. The Prata is always super crispy as promised in their name and the curry is always nice to dip the prata in, as is tradition. Although you can wait a little to find a seat, it's well worth it or you can always take away or Ta Pao in the local Singlish (Singapore/English) lingo.I'd also recommend that people look inside for seats too when seeking a seat as although it's a little warmer in the humidity of Singapore, quite often it's easier to sneak a seat and don't park illegally as you will most likely get a ticket.The little refreshments store serves up Iced Horlicks too which I can't help but get one every time we head there. I love the malty, milky goodness to kick off the day.Like anywhere in Singapore that serves at breakfast, I'd recommend getting there early as often places sell out.",

    "text": "Plenty of seating outside away from the smoky griddle. \u00a0Parking is quite limited.The roti pratas were crispy on the outside and very stretchy on the inside. \u00a0The thick and chunky curry included was a daal curry with a surprising bit of mutton flap meat. \u00a0It looks like there was a upgrade option for the curry to full mutton chunks but i missed it on the menu.Roti prata was $1.00 each for plain. $0.50 for egg, $0.80 for mushrooms and $0.30 for onion. Kopi and other drinks, as well as nasi lemak, offered by vendor sharing same space.",

    "text": "First time here! We enjoyed a selection of four pratas: egg, cheese, onion and mushroom. Taste - very good (and crispy as advertised) ... lite and not oilyQuality - actually much better we think than the prata on KillineyPresentation - are you kidding? If you're local, it's really the taste and quality that count. But presentation is authentic and on a stainless steel plate with three condiments/curries tooService - the Mrs. is very polite (the Mr. and associate rotated in their prata prep and cooking)Ambience - open air on the corner with inside (within the building and sidewalk) and outside (on the sidewalk) seatingCost: Couldn't go wrong for ~ S$6 for two with the healthy-size prata servings. \u00a0We also had two hot coffees too at S$1 each from a next door vendor. \u00a0Think cost and value are the key factors after taste and quality. Definitely a repeat-go-back-to-dining destination. And, yes, there can be folks waiting for their orders (even at 8 in the morning) but I observed the Mrs. does maintain a good awareness on each of the individuals/families whose order is whose as she writes them down on her hanging clip board. Popular with locals from all backgrounds. \u00a0A definite recommendation. \u00a0And compliments to the Mr. and Mrs. and the support folks too. We can appreciate the place's popularity.",

    "text": "The name of this place is very true to the experience. There was Mrs Mohgan taking order and handing out the dishes and Mr Mohgan making the fresh prata's to order. \u00a0No frills and all good food. \u00a0Go early to get a comfy plastic seat. \u00a0A hidden gem so I'm a little reluctant to write about this but it's too good not to tell others. \u00a0I tried 1 cheese and 1 onion Prata with a side of fish curry. \u00a0Many others had kofe with their breakfast too. \u00a0Off the beaten path but worth a visit if you want some good local fare. Made another local foodie friend so all in all it was a great random stop.",
