    "text": "If you're looking for authentic Szechuan then you've come to the right place. Everything is entirely in Mandarin, but all the menus have pictures on it so it's not too difficult to figure out. Most people actually made reservations, but fortunately my party was able to walk in. Between the four of us, we each ordered a dish including the mapo tofu, clams, pork noodles, and beef noodles. The mapo tofu was fantastic as were the clams. If you want a side of rice you do have to order separately, but it doesn't cost too much. Overall, the price was very fair for what you got",

Could have just been an off night for them as perhaps they were busy during the day. The fried was okay, but prob won't be back. Location is convenient right off the subway in Chinatown. Pretty pricey for what you get.",

    "text": "This is one of the two Szechuan cuisine places I will go to satisfy my craving for numbing spicy Szechuan food, the other being Si Wei Mao Cai.These two places serve pretty authentic Szechuan food and the portion is pretty generous, hence the higher price per serving.For this place, I usually get the chicken with chillis and a spicy bullfrog dish. Their chicken with chillis is very tasty, chicken fried just nice and the taste of the spices, garlic and chillis balance well to produce the flavorful and numbing chicken. They are very generous with their garlic, hence for garlic fans like me, this is a big plus.Their bullfrog on the other hand was not as fantastic as their chicken with chillis. We ordered the spicy and numbing bullfrog where the frog legs were literally drowned in the chilli oil, and the gravy within could not get into the frog legs, hence most of the time I just tasted oily spicy frog legs. No doubt the frog legs were fresh, but the gravy did not enhance the taste farther and it was rather disjointed. I would say it's an average dish.The previous time I was here, I ordered their spicy catfish dish which came in a huge portion. It could feed about 3-4 pax and the gravy was flavorful. What you should do is order dumplings or rice to go with this and you can enjoy the gravy at the same time.Overall, I would highly recommend this place, as I would usually take the trouble to write reviews for places that are worth writing for (against if it's really bad).",

Thanks to the generous amount of chili and peppercorn used in each dish, it was one of the most spiciest experiences in my life! They say \"spicy in, spicy out.\" Oh man, we'll find out soon enough..The undisputed favorite at our table was the Steamed Fish with yellow bean sprouts and chili (see my photo). Another favorite was the stir fried String Bean with chili. The plain and simple Eggs & Tomatoes were amazing, but mainly because it was the only non-spicy dish at our table! The location of this restaurant is convenient. It's right next to the Chinatown MRT. Exit the opposite side of People's Park and turn to your left. Bam. Time to spicy! Be prepared to have steam blow out from your ears.",
