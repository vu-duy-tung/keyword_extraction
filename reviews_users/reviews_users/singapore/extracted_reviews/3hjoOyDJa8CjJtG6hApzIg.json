    "text": "This Italian Caf\u00e9 is in a prime location, next to the wonderful Singapore Botanic Garden. Despite being next to a busy road, the glass acts as a perfect sound barrier. It isn't too crowded, and one or two tables are available at any one time. Outside tables are also available. There are a very good variety of table sizes. The atmosphere is very good, with nice, jazzy music in the background as you eat away. Service is quick, and the staff have a very good grip with English, so there will be no miscommunication, or difficulty understanding anything. The coffee is great quality, and at a good price ($5.50 for one). The ice chocolate is not a sweet one, more a savoury one. The food looks AMAZING, though. They have monster meringues, a wide variety of pastries and cakes, and a great assortment of drinks available. This place is recommended for a quick stop or lunch. Great caf\u00e9.",

    "text": "Valrhona chocolate and brandy cake ($9) - 3.75 starsThere are chocolate cakes and there are chocolate cakes. This one seems defined by its thick sturdy ganache topping. The cake itself is just as hardy and has the consistency and taste of say the centre of a baba au rhum - it's not a light and fluffy cake or \u00a0creamy mousse or a melt in your mouth Sacher torte. It's sort of like a more solid truffle. Anyhow it satisfied my chocolate cake craving, though I could only power through a couple of bites. The brandy is strong enough to give me a bit of a headache...Caramel shortbread ($4.70)",

    "text": "Decided to swing by here on a Sunday afternoon. The crowd was surprisingly not too bad. Managed to get a seat inside the store itself.Been wanting to indulge in the pizzas for a very long time but when I used to visit the branch in Grandstand, I tend to divert my attention to the list of pastas instead.This time round, my eyes were fixed on the pizza section. The price was reasonable and the one catches more attention than the salami pizza was the smoked salmon pizza.Browsing through the section of cupcakes and crodos, found myself eyeing on the hazelnut Crodo (Christmas spun for the Crodo). Queued and gave the waitress my two food items that I wanted to try this time round.The pizza base was crispy and fluffy. Surprisingly it wasn't too salty. I was looking for light bites and the pizza definitely satisfied my cravings. It was a little expensive but quality wise, it is worth the money spent. You can ask them to re-heat for you too.The hazelnut Crodo was interesting. It was decorated with thinned dark chocolate that looks like a nest. Inside was the hazelnut cream. The colored leaf like sugar toppings definitely brought colors to the dull Crodos. The hazelnut creme wasn't too sweet. Not too thick either and it oozed out of the Crodo while cutting the dish into smaller bite portions. The dark chocolate helped to tone down the sweetness from the sugar sprinkles on top of the Crodo and the other sugary items inside.Service was pretty efficient here. The waitress cleared up my plate quickly after I emptied the two plates of dishes. This was the second time that I'm here for some light bites and desserts. Will definitely be back again ;) Cheers!!",

Their was no menu, you had to go inside to look at the big board, order and afterwards they would bring your things to your table. It was 6pm and there was not a lot left anymore of the sweets (like we saw on the pictures here on Yelp), but there were still many pizza slices. We went for the vegi slice (7,5S$). It was served hot, with a wide variety of vegetables, but unfortunately the pizza was somewhat dry. Therefore only 3 stars, but it could have been more.",

The lasagne was nice on first taste but gradually got a bit floury near the end. I liked the crusty bits. It was good that they offered to warm it up and serve it on a plate. I tried a bite of my sister's Pasta Salad Chicken (takeaway) which was nice after she added a whole lotta Tabasco sauce. I guess their cooked on the spot dishes taste much better than their warmed up takeaways. Nevertheless, due to it's convenient location, I'll be coming back soon!",

This place is one of those foodie delights with all sorts of gourmet food available. However I've never really been all that much of a big fan of such food, so instead I simply grabbed myself a drink. It was a bit annoying though because I was standing at the counter for a while and everybody was ignoring me, until I realised that you had to walk around to the other side to actually pay for your goods. I can't say that this is one place I would be visiting again if I happen to be in Singapore.",

It reminds me strongly of the salted egg yolk that resides in traditional mooncakes, which is ok if you're a fan of that, but I happen not to like that. I have to give it credit for the texture of the croissant, which is deliciously flaky, fluffy and crunchy without being overly oily.",

The biggest downside at Da Paolo would be price with small items like a single Stuffed Portobello mushrooms costing up to $7 or $8 depending on the weight. Like any supermarket Da Paolo sells most of its items or antipasti by weight hence the price rockets if you're not careful with your portions. Sadly for an Italian owned business, coffee is poor as well with a mighty upsetting bitter to sour taste. The only saving grace would be the Tiramisu but look out for some that have been sitting in the shelves for too long, the alcohol soaked layers may be dry and would definitely kill your joy. Once again a great location to spend your weekends but not my best choice for food and drinks!",

The bread itself is huge- as a girl with a hearty appetite, I'm usually already quite full halfway through it. The sandwich is made on-the-spot, and can be customized to your preferences. They are also usually quite generous with the salmon helpings, but the quality isn't always consistent- there were times when the fish was limp and flaccid, and other times when it was over seasoned and hence too salty. Some might say that at $14++ per sandwich this standard is unacceptable- but I'm usually not too fussed because I think the ingredients and portion sufficiently justify the price. Very unusually, the veggies are in fact the star of the sandwich- they always come very fresh and crunchy. The vinaigrette dressing also elaborates the overall taste of the sandwich.On days when I decide to indulge, I head straight for the tiramisu. Their rendition is light and silky, allowing one to taste individually the chocolate, rum and expresso. The smallest portion is more than enough for 2- it is not cheap, but it is definitely worth it.",
