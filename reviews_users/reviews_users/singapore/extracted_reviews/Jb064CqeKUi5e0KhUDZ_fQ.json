    "text": "An intimate fine dining restaurant with creative dishes.I expected Rhubarb to be a traditional French restaurant. I ordered the set menu for dinner paired with red wine. Overall, the dishes were surprisingly tasty! The foie gras entr\u00e9e was the fish that amazed me the most. Usually in France we do not mix foie gras with fish, or we try to be minimal when it comes to foie gras. The foie gras from Rhubarb was served with Japanese radish, another type of radish, fish (estragon maybe?) and some sweet jelly. The foie gras was very tender. Pairings all of these ingredients together made the dish heavenly! The dishes in general felt like eating a work of culinary art (well, probably expected from a fine dining restaurant). As of the main, I got the Wagyu beef medium rare with melted in my mouth. It was served with an emulsion of some sort, with snails at the bottom. The snails were very soft and tasty. Don't be shy to eat snails, I promise this side will make you like them! The set menu has many dishes (1 amuse bouche, 3 entr\u00e9es, 1 main and 1 desert).The restaurant offers an great atmosphere with an intimate ambiance. There were only approximately 6 tables, so you should reserve in advance. The kitchen is also open. The service was great too.Bottom line, I understand why this restaurant has a Michelin star. Food, service, atmosphere.",

    "text": "Rhubarb is a small French restaurant on Duxton Hill that would be easy to miss which would be a shame, as the kitchen produces some truly beautiful and tasty dishes. \u00a0They also have a great lunch set at a reasonable price which is an excellent way to experience the potential of the kitchen, which is what we did on a rainy afternoon. \u00a0We started with an amuse buche - hamachi in cones, which reminded me of Spago. \u00a0The appetizer of cured Japanese mackerel was stunning, as it was cured in rhubarb, it was red and reminded me of an actual rhubarb stalk. \u00a0For the main, the pork loin was quite thick yet still succulent, and the mousseline of smoked potato added a nice touch. \u00a0As petit fours are served with coffee, I opted for a cheese plate for dessert, which was perfect. \u00a0Service is excellent, and the wine list has a well-picked selection of mainly French wines including a nice number of half bottles. \u00a0Definitely an experience you won't regret and worth a splurge!",

    "text": "Another lunch at a Michelin star restaurant. This was french cuisine and we tried the prix fixe menu. Started off with an amuse bouche in the form of an onion emulsion.. what can i say, it knocked us out of the park.. the flavors were incredible. I had the beef tartare with foie grais as my appetizer which was excellent! Followed that up with Japanese mackerel with chorizo which was heavenly and finished up with farm cheese plate which was great. Would have expected a bit more finesse in terms of dessert options, hope they put that up soon! Service was impeccable. Great place to celebrate an occasion as well!",

It is a great ambience and vibe, and the team there could was incredibly keen to ensure we had a favorable experience. Thank you Jerome and team. Desserts were incredible. I enjoyed mine more than Rahul's (I believe I had a mousse of sorts), but sharing is caring - so I shared the wealth (and the calories). Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Rhubarb le Restarant is a must go. Every dish is beautifully presented and executed. The highlights were the bread, white onion emulsion, foie gras served with rhubarb (I really never knew that rhubarb could be so tasty!) and hay flavoured ice cream. They state that the entire table must participate in 'le menu' but the chef did not enforce that so we tried the dinner menu and some ala carte items.Besides the food, we really loved the modern decor and the small setting. I highly recommend Rhubarb le restaurant. Did I mention that it is a must go?",

    "text": "My admission was that from previous French Restaurants, where I paid over $100++ and was still hungry, I was skeptical.But to my surprise, the portion sizes, and food options were spot on.Not too many, and those, where the ingredients I couldn't consume such as dairy/grans/carbs, the staff advised that it could be removed, or served on the side.We ordered Quail and my buddy ordered a beef. I though the beef was a bit more generic, but again, I was pleasantly surprised.Smoothly smokey, woody, and flavoured. My quail was wrapped in veggies, so both birds were killed with one stone....well, nutritionally \u00a0: )Impeccable chocolate desserts, we ordered 2 varieties between us, and were just impressed with every bite.I strongly recommend this place!",

It starts with exceptional food that confidently boasts a merger of flavors and textures that are not typically associated with French but that's only because it reaches across genres of cuisines. Chef is innovative and passionate and enjoys his personal touch with customers as he personally brought out my entree and explained the evolution of the dish which was superb. Only 7 tables in the restaurant and they ensure that you feel special and have a memorable experience. An outstanding evening altogether. A must when you're in Singapore.",

The kitchen is an open concept, and yet the establishment managed to maintain a calm ambience. \u00a0The food was excellent, and we enjoyed every course from the set menu. The chef (and sous chefs) came to the table to explain most of the dishes. They were flexible and innovative in meeting some requests, as one of us had a medical condition. The wait staff and front of house deserve a very special mention, they were all extremely professional, attentive, and friendly. We had such a great time, and will certainly be back.",
