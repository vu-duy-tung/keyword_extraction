I said ok I hope it's not another disappointing Creperie.One bite into my spinach and salmon crepe and immediately I remembered that evening outside the steps of the Sacre Coeur at 940pm and still summer bright and being so mesmerized by the crispy and superbly flavored crepe that was whipped up by a local dude in the back of his foodtruck. We shared each other's crepes with greedy delight.I'll come back again before I leave Singapore on this short trip. Entre Nous, my best wishes and congratulations.",

We thought it would be crowded since it is a small spot. But there were only 2 other groups inside. \u00a0They offer sweet and savory crepes. They make their own caramel sauce which they put on their sweet crepes and also sell pots of them. I had a simple ham and cheese crepe. And for dessert i had a chocolate and banana crepe. The chocolate was home made and it came with homemade ice cream. Both of my options were simple and decent. Not sure if they are a bang for your buck, as i feel ive had better crepe options. I could have had a small green salad with the crepe and a bit more filling. My friend ordered the French onion soup, which was nothing special. the cheese wasnt grilled on top \u00a0Another friend tried their speciality crepe with the Salted caramel sauce. \u00a0it was good and different. \u00a0not overky sweet. overall was nice to try it out. It might not be my first option when thinking of places to go around there, but a possible option.",

    "text": "This small tiny shop can be easily missed. My husband and I walked around the area a couple of times to find this place. Google maps was not that helpful and directed us somewhere else. We got to the shop a bit late, but was able to order the Crepe with Salted Butter Caramel Ice Cream. It was my first time getting crepe and the fillings separately. The crepe was flat on the plate with a small dish of ice cream next to it. I was in for a bit of shock when I first saw it, but I realized that if you have the fillings separated from the crepe the crepe would taste much better and it would not become soggy. So we would cut pieces of the crepe out one at a time and place a small portion of the ice cream right on top and pick the crepe up and enjoy. The taste was amazing, where the crepe is still a bit warm and the ice cream is still cold. The crepe was also slightly sweetened but I did also tasted a tiny bit of saltiness (it could have been from the ice cream as well). The blend of both ice cream and crepe was wonderful. I would love to stop by this small shop, if we have the time.",

We only tried the savory ones and they were great. Nothing fancy just the typical ingredients but the crepe is thin and tasty and that made me happy.The only minus is the fonts on the menu is soooo hard to read!! Maybe it's my old eyes...",

I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the crepes tasted (and buckwheat no less). \u00a0Came on a Sunday and despite it being close to a full house, the 1 server and 1 cook managed shockingly well. When I am craving crepes this will be where I will look to first. The bad: \u00a0Decor needs a huge overhaul. Tables, chairs, art, it all needs to be revamped. The \"booth\" seating is just a run of small padding on a 90 degree plastic bench. Incredibly uncomfortable to sit on. The walls were sparse which not only looks bad but it bounces sounds and makes for an amplified chamber of chatter. I could easily, and unwillingly, hear every conversation from every table. On that day there was a couple breaking up, an infant smacking a spoon repeatedly on the table, a family on vacation and a handful of locals talking about Thailand. See, that was annoying just to read, imagine listening to that for a whole meal. The ugly: Doesn't pull off the quaint mom and pop vibe although the staff makes me suspect they are. If so, make it more homey, if not, pour some money into making it higher end. Prices are too high, but I didn't mind so much considering the food was good. \u00a0But at the end of the day should anyone pay $20+ for a crepe?",
