    "text": "There was a long queue when my friend and I decided to have dinner here. Instead of finding somewhere else to eat so we wouldn't have to wait so long, we decided to stick it out because where there's a crowd, there's usually treasure.After what seemed like 20 mins, a table was ready for us and, famished, we hurried in while tactfully eyeing the buffet spread and planning our attack. I spotted sushi, sashimi, fresh seafood, and grilled meat. With closer inspection I also noticed they had a spread of local & Italian dishes and \u00a0of course. desserts! \u00a0I was beyond ecstatic. I wouldn't say the ambiance was exceptional, unless of course you like the non-stop chattering of aunties, the occasional shrieks of laughter or screaming kids, but being there on a Sunday evening probably accounted for the rowdiness.Overall the experience was satisfying, and that's to say it was good food at value for money.",

    "text": "Through personal observations, I've noticed the general tendency among famished people to make poor dining decisions...and ever more so as the scale of desperation increases.Here was I definitely famished...and ending up making a poor decision when I spontaneously brought my fair lady to dine here for lunch. I am out of words as to how to really describe the experience but looking back, I have this weird wish that someone working the cashier collecting my $75+ for the both of us would have said something along the lines of \"Welcome to Trailer Park Buffet, enjoy yer meal son.\"The food...selections looked wonderful as we traveled through the various sections deciding on which areas to begin our plunge. But experience teaches one that looks, however, are obviously deceiving (EDIT: I removed my original phrase here just in case I get seriously flamed; ask me via PM if you're curious).My initial attack started at the Teppanyaki-style section, which ironically ended up defining my expectations of the culinary standards of *trailer park buffet* for the rest of our meal - O-M-Freaking-BLAND. No salt. NO SALT. For goodness sake, WHY?Moving on, I dove straight into the fresh seafood section close to the entrance. The oysters...were shucked at the station continuously as the human bodies were never a scarcity when it comes to grabbing oysters. Fresh US oysters they say...well, they are partially correct. They did, however, forget to add \"50% of the time\". As for the others: mussels were as expected...tastes right out of the package; crawfish...dry; and scallops...really dry.Unsatisfied thus far, I entered a state of zombie frenzy and attacked the next meat section I came across (I skipped the \"carving station\" because they were serving HAM...ffs, HAM???) and grabbed as much satay skewers that my hand could get. Paired with peanut sauce, red onions, and cucumbers, I ate away not caring about the people behind me in the line that I must have juked in the process. Sorry people...I was late to the party and only have 15 minutes remaining in the dining experience...gotta play catch up.I moved on to the tempura section shortly after and grabbed about 15 prawns to my lady's horror (I'm allergic to shrimp in large amounts). While the prawns were decent, I held much love for the sweet potato tempura slices. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.As the grand finale, I had two servings of salmon \"sashimi\" cut in front of me. (Side note: I wish one particular friend would see my facial expression right there and then...I was horrified by the knife skills and the method it was cut.) Anyways, the salmon tasted somewhat fresh...but wasn't deboned properly and still had the outer \"unwanted\" layer still present. (Oh well, it's a buffet...who expects knife skills and proper handling anyways...)All-in-all...a bad decision.*******I also worked most of the other sections by grabbing tidbits to determine if they were worth grabbing larger portions later on. Nothing stood out...didn't return for extra helpings./end-thy-whining/strongly-recommend-ala-skipYelp 100: 25/100",

    "text": "This place is the worst!Came here because it was a work event and we needed to seat 30 people. Every single person said they would never come back. Every item from the rice to the meat and seafood was bland, tasteless and/or of poor quality. Even the deserts were gross.. the only item semi decent was the sashimi bar (that's probably why it's the first stand you see as you walk in to pay.I even waited 20 minutes to taste their chilli crab and when that came out it tasted like mini crab shells cooked in ketchup (and they were stingy with it.... you had to beg for some and wait only to realize it was not even worth eating)This is by far the worst food I've had in Singapore, one one of if not the worst buffet's anywhere. And to boot, they had the worst of all my pet peeves.. filthy bathrooms.AVOID!",

    "text": "My friend and I visited yesterday for lunch.The young lady working at the entrance greeted us with \"What do you want?\" accompanied by a blank robotic expression. \u00a0That should have been our clue that cued us to walk away, but we paid $74.86 for 2 of us and entered into the steamy \"Pit of Food\"The restaurant was uncomfortably warm. \u00a0 They had fans set up to try and make it better but it was not cool enough. \u00a0Most of the food was not bad, but not out of the ordinary. The Beef Randang was not good - tough, chewy and flavourless. \u00a0The freshly grilled beef and pork Satay were better. \u00a0The \"budget\" sushi and seafood selection was not impressive. \u00a0The fish was dry. \u00a0The desserts were mostly not good although I enjoyed the fried banana fritter. \u00a0The Good: \u00a0Strap on a bottomless feed sack and graze for hours for one price. ($37.43 each for Saturday lunch) The Bad: \u00a0The robotic receptionist, the uncomfortably warm restaurant, the low quality of some of the food and the queueing. \u00a0There was a long wait for the pork satay to cook because the kiasu guests in front would take 20-30 skewers at a time without any regard for those behind them. Loud and chaotic. \u00a0Noisy families with untamed children. \u00a0Did I mention the queueing?The Verdict: \u00a0If it is not your goal to consume endless quantities of mostly mediocre food in a loud chaotic environment - then shuffle away to one of the other restaurants in Raffles City. I would rather pay the same amount for better quality (and smaller portions) of food, better service and a calmer and more civilized atmosphere. \u00a0Not a good value.",

The place is really nice, the food is always freshly made, lots of variety undoubted, and presented nicely. I guess it's more of the location and service that I'm not a really fan of. It's always full and noisy, and the servers tend to rush you.",
