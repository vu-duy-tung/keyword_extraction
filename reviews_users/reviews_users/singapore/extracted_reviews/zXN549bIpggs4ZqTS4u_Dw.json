It was fun to eat family style as it allowed us to try a lot of different items. Good food but expensive and they charge you for everything including the peanuts and wet wipes for after you have eaten the crab. Go to Chinatown for great food at a much lower cost.",

The crab quality was also lacking. \u00a0The texture of the crab, in some parts of the crab was off. \u00a0I had hoped that the sauce (even though it wasn't the greatest) would permeate the meat inside the crab, but I found the crab to be very unaffected by the sauce smothered on the outside. \u00a0WAY too much sauce in that dish for me!The service was pretty bad. \u00a0Nobody checking in on us, except for the very end when the meal was over.Kudos to the restaurant though for giving me the option to pay some of the bill with U.S. dollars. \u00a0I accidentally left my wallet in the hotel but luckily I had some cash in my pocket but still left me short in Singaporean dollars. \u00a0They agreed to let me pay the rest in U.S. currency. \u00a0If they refused, I would've had to take a taxi back to the hotel to fetch the $. \u00a0Very thankful that they did that for me.As for the crab part of the experience, it definitely fell short for me. \u00a0Crab House in San Francisco on Pier 39 is the winner for me. \u00a0That is the standard for whole crab. \u00a0I guess I'm spoiled.",

    "text": "Out of the branches, the outdoor seating in Jumbo Dempsey is beautiful. Brought a friend visiting Singapore few weeks ago and we couldn't have asked for a better atmosphere/seating. With guests, D and I always get:-the award winning Chilli crab/black pepper crab + dozen (or more) bread-Deshelled prawn with salad cream in golden nest, or deshelled wasabi prawn. -Scallop wrapped in Yam Ring-Steamed bamboo clam with minced garlic and some fried ricetook off one star bc while the waiters were generally honest at this branch, the chilli crab came with basically no chilli. We were done after dipping our breads into it for a bit. Usually, there is so much chilli leftover that I end up taking it away and eating it with rice next day for lunch. Disappointing, but the great atmosphere and the other dishes made up for it. Make sure to make reservations early! for visitors, i also recommend No Signboard in Esplanade bc of the beautiful view of marina bay sands and raffles place, though you have to keep alert NOT to get ripped off by the greedy waiters.",

Also, bf's family friend also swears by the chilli crab at this particular outlet of Jumbo Seafood, apparently. Although, I have to say, Forture Seafood along Bkt Timah Rd does a pretty gd rendition (and their mantous are to die for, really) for cheaper. Not as nice ambience there though.Soon hock in soy sauce was fresh and delicious!Spinach beancurd with spinach/three types of mushrooms (enoki/shimeji/shiitake, I think) was delicious too!Roast chicken, mm.Black pepper venison, very tender!Kai lan in garlic, normal.HK mee, pretty gd too! Nice al dente/bite to the noodles, crunchy prawn, shredded cabbage and bean sprouts.Yam paste dessert and mango pudding were pretty gd!Can't comment on prices as this was a treat. But Jumbo card holders get 20% off ala carte and 10% off set menus. They also sell the chilli crab paste should you wish to try making your own chilli crab at home!",

    "text": "If this was a normal dining experience, I'd really rate JUMBO Seafood at Dempsey only three stars. BUT. As a JUMBO privilege card member, I got 20% off our a la carte orders, AND 50% off the fresh crabs. Yes, you read that right. HALF PRICE off the Chili crab and Pepper and Spiced Salt crab that we ordered. So for that awesome value, I'm adding a star. Dinner was a pretty last minute decision; we only realised that the voucher for 50% off crabs was only valid for April on the 29th of April... so at 8pm we frantically tried calling the Dempsey branch because it was the most central for all of us. As expected of a busy restaurant there was no answer... so we went online and Chope-d our seats. SCORE.Got there, and as we ordered, we were a little disappointed. They'd run out of a few drinks, and didn't have anymore pork ribs. So we ordered two crabs, their scallops wrapped in yam, black-pepper venison, baby kai lan fried with garlic and mantou.I won't talk about the crabs, since everyone does, but I highly recommend the scallops wrapped in yam. The yam is light, crispy, and sweet. While a little overpowering for the scallops, they're still very enjoyable and actually quite addictive. The black-pepper venison was also a pleasant surprise. The black pepper sauce was incredibly rich, fragrant, and really stole the show. We were mopping it up with the mantou instead of using it on the Chili crab. It was THAT GOOD!So all that food, with some drinks... at $50 a head? I MEAN COME ON! That's definitely worth one star right there. I'm just looking forward to the 50% off fresh lobster month. :D",

The service is prompt but not on the polite-side. The staff are mostly Chinese-speaking and do not understand a lot of English, which for some, myself included, makes it very difficult to give a simple order.The interior is nothing great, following their corporate colours, and themes. If you've been to one, they're just about the same as the rest without a hint of uniqueness. Jumbo about the biggest player in Singapore's seafood market, just about every local has been there! They've definitely built a big name for themselves, and for that they have my respect.Generally a place for family or co-workers, it is a great place for a reunion and even a company dinner.Mon - Sat, 12:00 pm - 9:00 pmSunday, Closed",

Just straight forward, Singapore style/quality crab.We had the crispy baby squid heads, which when coupled with beer, were fishy-squidy-amazing. We dipped them in the sweet chili garlic sauce (pretty sure that was a faux pas but do not care) which made them even better.The bun situation kind of bugged me though- the buns were on the small side and didn't come with the chili crab. Weird.Dempsey is ideal in that if you didn't make a reservation and had to wait, there are pubs/breweries in short walking distance to pass time.",

The service was brisk and but attentive with a system that was ore teaming oriented - which I liked, but which sometimes caused cross services issues (drinks vs. food etc.). \u00a0But somehow it worked out and everything worked very well. \u00a0We had some game dish and then some terrific pepper steak strips. \u00a0Both relatively salty but cooked medium rare so were absolutely tasty. The crab was king of the night.... \u00a0The two styles were equally good with the pepper (dark) being my favorite. \u00a0Each crab had enough meat and the sauce was deliciously tangy with a strong burn but not overwhelming. \u00a0Quite an experience.

I do like this location of Jumbo, its more convenient than going all the way to East Coast. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. Personally, I hate sitting outdoors because the mosquitos start feeding on me! Nothing is worst than going for dinner and leaving with lots of mosquito bites.TIP: if you mosquitos love you, and you have to sit outside, wear long pants. And spray insect repellent if needed. This is not 100% fool proof, but it will help a little, thus enabling you to enjoy your meal more.Everyone loves eating chili crab here. I personally enjoy eating black pepper crab here. It is quite spicy! Be prepared to get your hands all dirty- but that is part of the experience! Don't worry, there are finger bowls as well as bathrooms for you to wash your hands.The food here is excellent. Some of the usual dishes I like to order are:-sambal kang kong-Hong Kong style steamed soon hok -Deep fried yam with scallop-Fried Rice and Fried Hor Fun Overall, a great place for seafood!",

    "text": "Out of all the Jumbo branches in Singapore this one in Dempsey is hands down my favorite. The food simply tasted better than any other place and the service is far superior; you get your food quick and the service was very friendly. It is tough picking between the two flavors, but for me the chilli crab slightly edges out the black pepper crab. Fortunately I've had enough people in my party to try both. The chilli crab has a nice balance of sweet and spicy flavor. It comes in a rich, delicious eggy broth and is best enjoyed with steamed or fried buns. The pepper crab is packed with black pepper flavor and has a slight kick. Also if you don't want to get too messy they will crack your crab for you!Besides the crab, the surprise dish during this meal was the cereal prawn. It's a perfectly cooked prawn coated a thick cereal batter. The crispiness of the batter and the small chunks of green chilli give this dish a delightful sweet, spicy and crunchy flavor. Along with the great food and service, there is also outdoor seating which is nice when the weather is cool. If you have to choose one place to get some delicious crab, this is definitely the one you want to pick.",

If you come here on your own terms, be prepared for pretty steep prices. It was a really good experience but I deducted one star because they have shark fin on the menu and the service was a little lackluster and slow. The salted egg crab (coated in a rich layer of salted egg yolk) was my least favorite. I definitely enjoyed the chili crab (not really spicy at all) but actually found the black pepper crab more interesting in flavor. From the huge choice of appetizers, the scallops and the dragon fruit with lobster stood out the most. \u00a0Word of advice: don't wear a white shirt or any piece of clothing you care about.
