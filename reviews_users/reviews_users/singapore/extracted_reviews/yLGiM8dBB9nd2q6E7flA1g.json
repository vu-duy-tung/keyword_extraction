    "text": "So, a New England native comes straight from Boston to live in Singapore. The first thing he notices: you can make buildings out of materials other than bricks. Several epiphanies later, he realizes that most of the pizza here is awful and exorbitantly overpriced.Relatively speaking to Singapore standards, Bella's pies are good, and though they're a bit more expensive than the average place, it's not the kind of shakedown you can expect from other spots in the area. If they're still serving the salmon pizza, I'd recommend it; original and surprisingly well done.",

    "text": "I came here because it had good reviews and was close to my hotel. I didn't order pizza, and maybe that was my problem. After looking at the menu I settled on the gnocchi, and I must admit that I had a mixed reaction to it. The flavored and presentation were very good, however I'm giving my this three stars because the gnocchi was over cooked to the point of being mush. Otherwise the space is lovely, though not set up for single diners. I hope the pizza is better than their pasta.",

Opted to sit in. Was excited based on reviews. The pizza was pretty good. I'd go back for that again. Also had the avocado and mango salad. Would not recommend. Was a pile of spinach with a few slivers of avocado and mini-cubed mango pieces. There was also ship, two to be exact that were halved. Stingy with the good stuff. So pizza and don't go alone. You won't get a decent table.",

    "text": "This is good pizza but I am not blown away by it. It is too thin for my tastes. It is like the pizza in France, or a little thicker than the pizza in Rome (but with a little worse cheese), both of which I consider inferior to pizza in Napoli. However, they may be catering to the Singaporean palette, and that would probably mean making a similar style of pizza as the early entrant Da Paolo. If this is true, they execute their efforts toward that goal very well.I am in love with Bella Pasta which is under the same ownership.The weekday lunch special is a steal. 18++ for a salad, a pizza, ice cream, and coffee or tea.",

When I find a nice pizza like this I usually go traditional and get classic margarita. You can't go wrong. I have been many times but always forget to review. Will check in with photos next time. Cool spot too if alone or with group of people",
