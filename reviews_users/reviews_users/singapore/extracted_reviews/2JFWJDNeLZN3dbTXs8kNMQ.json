    "text": "Our favorite restaurant in Singapore. Located in the Grand Hyatt on Orchard Road, Straits Kitchen is a buffet that showcases the best of Singapore's local fare with its many different live cooking stations. \u00a0Each cooking station is directly behind the serving counters,and this has definitely ensured freshly cooked food with almost every dish they prepare.Malay/Peranakan specialties including Ayam Buah Keluak (chicken cooked with Indonesia black nuts),Beef Rendang,etc.-Satay station! This was one of the busiest stations,with freshly flame grilled marinated chicken,beef,and mutton satays.-Noodle station,with freshly cooked made-to-order prawn mee soup,laksa,etc.-Bbq chicken and the beloved local dish,Hainanese chicken.-Chinese fare including the Singaporean favorite carrot cake freshly cooked from the wok and served directly to patrons! The Chinese station also had local favorite chili crab!! Tasty!-Popiah station! One of my personal favorites. \u00a0Feel free to custom make it the way you like,e.g. more sauce,more radish,less peanuts,etc.-Salad station -Not your typical boring salads but they feature indian salads,thai salads with green mango,etc. \u00a0They also have made-to-order Chinese rojak.-Part of the Indian station,they have roti prata,naan,etc. made on the spot!-Indian station featuring a myriad of curries,tandoori meats,etc. \u00a0Whenever I think about the food at this station, I have major cravings to go to Straits Kitchen.",

    "text": "One useful tip when you go there - do not take too much rice, otherwise you will feel full faster and won't get to taste the rest of the cuisines available.Straits Kitchen is one stop where you can sample almost all local dishes. One might argue that it's better to head to some hawker centre but hey wait till you get here. Yes, prices are steep but you get big prawns and crabs. It's also classy, air-conditioned and doesn't have the hawker smell lingering around. Efficient and observant staff clear plates and replenish cutlery while you get a fresh helping of other items. It's not somewhere you would want to head to for a quiet meal though, it's mainly families who dine there together. The restaurant is always busy, so it's not a bad idea to make a reservation before you actually go down. It saves precious time and avoids disappointment.",

    "text": "I generally do not go for buffets which feature local food. This is because local street food is so inexpensive and usually very much better. However, the food here is really really good. I hear they actually bothered to get proper hawkers to make their food, and it shows. The roasted meat section is one such example. The chicken rice and the chilli can match up to any in a hawker center. The have a amazing tandoori spread, with all kinds of wonderful grilled meat. The dessert spread is also good. Last year during ramadan, they invited an Egyptian dessert chef to do the pastries. absolutely amazing. Overall, this is a place I would take my foreigner friends as an introduction to local food in a comfortable airconditioned comfort.",

    "text": "I guess the name gave it away. A true local food fare like no other, the Straits Kitchen offers an upscale local buffet spread with everything from chicken rice to Indian crab curry. Best of all, fresh fruit juices are included, perfect for this tropical dining experience. \u00a0Among the local flavours offered, the Indian buffet spread offers a rich selection of seafood based curries such as crab, fish and prawns. The prawns used are not your regular prawns but instead they are huge succulent king prawns that soak up flavour well. Not in the mood for prawns? Dive into the crab curry instead, the sweet flower crabs are a perfect complement to the array of spices in the curry. One thing that doesn't make sense to me though is \"kopi\" and \"teh\" are an additional charge and don't come cheap at the Hyatt! Book early if you're planning on visiting over the weekend.",

Plenty of fresh fruit and juices were available. It was an interesting experience to eat breakfast foods from a variety of regions/cultures, and all prepared well. The buffet food is also considered to be Halal (permissible under Islamic Law), so there is no swine (pork), but with the variety of selection I didn't miss having it at breakfast.",

Till 12 Dec!!If you think that Sichuan noodles is all about spicy minced meat paste on top of dry dan-dan noodles, \u00a0then you got to try the authentic version at Chinese kitchen of halal-certified buffet restaurant Straits Kitchen. Chef Patrick Pan from Xi-an, China celebrates the culinary heritage of his roots by introducing two types of Sichuan noodles that would definitely transform the stereotypical image of Sichuan cuisine.Dan Dan Mian aka Peddler's NoodlesTaking a subtle approach to the dan dan mian, Chef Pan whips out a soupy version that is blended with peanut paste which gives it a very pleasant aroma. Dip the spoon into the sea of the reddish broth without the wavy noodles and one will haul up a mound of dried peppercorn, sesame seeds, spring onions--all the necessary ingredients that makes this bowl particularly rich and flavour duck. Contrary to its fiery outlooks, the noodles only carries a faint fugitive heat, stimulating my craving for some chilli padi. Dao Xiao Mian (Knife-shaved noodles)Meanwhile, I was fully impressed by how Chef Pan managed to allow the flavors of the components; cumin, star anise, homemade Sichuan Chilli oil, peppercorns, Japanese leeks and Chinese parsley to shine through without overpowering one another. Pairing this clean broth with pleasantly chewy knife-shaved noodles makes for a surprisingly refreshingly bite. A less herby and salty version of a Vietnam Beef Pho with some ridiculously soft 5-hour slowed braised Australian beef shank. I would have slurped down the two bowls of MSG-free broth if there weren't so many other temptations around. Given that this Sichuan Promotion is part of the weekday buffet at Straits Kitchen, one has no reason to leave without trying all the uniquely Singaporean dishes that are constantly whipped out from the theatrical show kitchens.",

I had the pleasure of staying at the Grand Hyatt on more than a few occasions in Singapore and was stunned to see this restaurant located within this beautiful, business-travel friendly hotel.The reason? Awesome food from many locations, China, Malaysia, India, and Indonesia, all freshly prepared at various stations, with fresh pressed tropical and standard juices, making this one of the most wonderful breakfast buffet choices I've ever encountered. Anywhere.OK maybe not every single dish was noteworthy, the Chinese dishes come to mind as not my favorites, but with SO MUCH to choose from, from standard US breakfast fare to the more exotic Asian blends, the lesser dishes fade into the background. This is probably not inexpensive (I was traveling on business Per Diem) but the experience was great and was every time I went (which was 4 times).So if you are fortunate to visit this Grand Hyatt, you owe it to yourself to visit StraitsKitchen at least once. I'm pretty certain, you will not regret it.Oh and the coffee's good too. :)",

The food is actually pretty good, with lots of variety, but you can get just as good or better in many coffeeshops or hawker centres. It's also pricey, for what you get.One big misstep, in my opinion, is that the buffet does not come with any drinks at all.

Walk around and try as much as you can. Full price of $55+ per person (about $61 including tax) will seem steep compared to eating these dishes in hawker centres, but the environment, robust flavours and good service makes up for it.

We never ran in to a wait, nor was the restaurant ever so crowded that it was hard to walk. \u00a0It's hard to beat the coffee, which is of a richer, french press style - delicious! The ambiance was excellent with beautiful architectural elements, warm lighting and cozy tables. The restaurant had a lot of seating, yet still felt very intimate.",

You can probably get just as good if not better food at an outdoor hawker centre, and the price would be more reasonable, but to do that you'd have to be a true local/insider to know where to go and what to order. The restaurant is buffet style, which means a lot of bustle, noise, etc - producing a good vibe if you are with a large group of friends. I would definitely go again.",

    "text": "I was there a couple of weeks ago on a Monday with the wife and our baby boy to celebrate my birthday. Was a spur-of-the-moment thing, called in just an hour before dinner buffet started and reserved a table. The guy on the phone even said that they'd give me a complimentary slice of cake for my birthday. Sweet, I said.So we got there, a couple of minutes too early so waited for a little while. Got seated. Staff were courteous. Asked for water, because alcohol in Singapore is exorbitant (what more at a swanky place like Hyatt). In the end, we didn't eat too much (unlike locals who starve themselves before buffet meals and stack up on the crabs :-D) and I paid SG$130 all in, tax and tips (about US$104) for two person. Was it worth it? Not exactly. As a local (not exactly one but having spent my childhood in Malaysia, and a couple of years in Singapore), I would say no. Mainly because there are many great food options littered all around the country, for a small fraction of the price. However, that's also the problem - the best dish options I benchmarked against the buffet options - otak2, biryani, gado2, popiah, chili crab - are literally found at different locations in Singapore. If you're looking for decent (not best or even amazing) local fare under one roof in a very convenient location (orchard) in a comfortable/airconditioned restaurant, this is your place. And yes, this would be a good choice for a foreigner without the luxury of time to explore for real kickass local food in Singapore. If one had time, one should even journey up north to Malaysia for tastier Singaporean/Malaysian food (yeah almost all Singaporeans agree that food in Malaysia are generally way better than in Singapore)",

The most impressive lobby with grand entrances and flower arrangements. So you'd expect the restaurants to be up to the par -- and have to say the are. We ate at both Straitskitchen and 10Scott. Straitskitchen dinner buffet was very tasty. There were many food stations. Just from memory: chinese, Malaysian, indian, greek, Japanese - and I think there was a few more. There was EVEN a JUICE station with 5 different fresh squeezed juice options. There were also several dessert stations too! One for traditional treats. then icecream. \u00a0then deep fry / shaved ice. We came during Ramadan, so the restaurant told us that meant there will be additional dishes of food, but the cost will be bit more around 85 per person. So I'm giving it 4 stars because everything about the restaurant is specular. Really enjoyed it. But it was just a bit pricey. Would recommend if have short amount of time and want to sample all the different cultural cuisine this is good, or celebrating an occasion because it has just great atmosphere.",

I think this will be the last time \u00a0we dine there. The quality of food seems to have gone downhill over the years. Our palates weren't happy enough to justify the prices they charge.

    "text": "StraitsKitchen in the Grand Hyatt is worth the stopover if you're in the area. Bourdain gave this place his approval and so do I. It's a fantastic way to try all the local cuisines in one place without having to order 10 different dishes. It's a buffet, so you can sample a little of everything from local Malay, Chinese, and Indian cuisines. The Malay station had otah otah freshly grilled in banana leaves, stingray smothered in sambal, beef rendeng, chicken + lamb + mutton satay and that peanut sauce is to die for! Down by the desserts, the station continues with made to order rojak and popiah. I only wish they had the famous Singaporean chili crab or salted egg crab. The Chinese station had peppered crab, winter melon soup, and various stir fried dishes. The noodle station had every kind of Singaporean noodle you can think of: prawn mee, laksa, fish ball noodle soup, and so many other options. The BBQ station had roasted duck, steamed chicken, and soy sauce chicken. Chicken rice straight from the rice cooker too. All the condiments for your liking to boot!The Indian station had roti, naan, and tons of saucy dishes to go with your carbs. The dessert selection is wide ranging from sweet soups (tang shui), to baked and steamed kuehs, to mango puddings and grass jellies, and tropical ice cream!Service was excellent. They servers wi refill your water as soon as you take a sip and remove your plate when you get up. When they see crab on your place, they'll place a bowl of warm water and lemon for rinsing. I only wish I had a bigger stomach so I can try everything. They were all so good. Definitely recommend if your time in SG is limited but you're a fatty and wanna try everything like me. As of October 2017, it came out to $57 a person for dinner.",

Food buffet : we did all 3 on different days breakfast, lunch and dinner. Make reservations this place gets busy and I can see why. Prices : may seem high but comparable to other hotel buffets. The choices are in abundance: Malaysian , Singaporean, Indian, Indonesian and more.Try everything it's all good, staff excellent ,This is now my # 1 Buffet spot is the world. You cannot beat its variety, quality, service .If I could give 10 stars I would. Excellent keep it up will be back in a few months.",

    "text": "Had a reservation here one Sunday in June. Hosted a friend who lived in my condo building back in Atlanta. I wanted my friend to try out the different variety of local food. Personally I feel there was no better place to try so many local items in a comfortable environment than at Straits Kitchen @ Grand Hyatt. Lunch includes a free flow of 4-5 types of juices. There were many stations each serving different ethnic food. There were like Indian, Chinese, Malay sections. There was a huge station that had many desserts displayed when we could help ourselves. Food quality was definitely good here and of cos very fresh. The chefs/cooks cooked the food right there and served them straight to the stations. My friend has a small appetite so my brother and I would take a little of everything for her to try. I couldn't remember how much was the lunch buffet since my mom was the one paying for all five of us. Just know weekend buffet lunch includes free flow of juices while buffet dinner does not.The restaurant's entrance was kind of in a chaos when the staff started letting patrons with reservations to enter for lunch. I believe that chaos could be eliminated with better procedure of how to get over a dozen of people to enter the restaurant at about the same time. Overall, a very good place to try out almost all the local Singapore food in just one place.",

You get the same type of environment in an air conditioned food court minus the good plates removal service ( something you can never get at a food court) and the expatriate crowd (Again cannot get at the food court).The food counters serving different type of local food Indian, Chinese, Malay, drinks and desserts. The quality is just above average of any food court. Really nothing special you get nasi lemak, chicken rice, wonton noodle, poppiah, ice kachang, chendol... u get the idea.There are other places where you can get better local food but this place ups by having them all in one place.",

I made a reservation online and had first seating for both nights (weekend & weekday).Take a walk around the contemporary dining area and you will find yourself surrounded by food action stations. Malay, Indian, Chinese cuisines all cooked by chefs from those regions. Beef Rendang, Chicken/Beef/Mutton Satay, Chili Crab or Black Pepper Crab, Laksa and various Asian Noodles, Popiah, Prata and all the Indian curries you could possibly eat. I'm really not good with words so maybe my pictures can help describe my dining experience at StraitsKitchen! Hours are from 5:30-10:30pm depending on the day. Cost is about $52 USD",

    "text": "I still think Straits Kitchen (halal restaurant) is a good introduction to local food albeit in an upscale and more comfortable setting with service. You get to try the various Singapore ethnic cuisines in one area - Peranakan (Straits Chinese), Chinese, Malay and Indian.The Indian food is always the favorite as the dishes are well executed. The others are also good though not as good as what you can get in some well known hawker stalls. The ayam buah keluak was a bit of a disappointment as the buah kelauk paste was mixed into the gravy. The fun was in digging out the minced meat nutty paste from the shell though.The satay was good though the peanut sauce was on the sweet side. Chicken would be more tender than the beef or mutton. The desserts are also local fares with Nonya kuehs, ice kachang and chendol as staples. The ice cream and sorbets are also tropical fruit based - durian and coconut ice cream, anyone? Lychee or mango sorbet. I like the Horlicks ice cream which is creamy and malty. The not so good thing about a local food buffet is that you cannot really try everything as almost all the dishes are very rich with coconut and carb-based (rice and noodles).",
