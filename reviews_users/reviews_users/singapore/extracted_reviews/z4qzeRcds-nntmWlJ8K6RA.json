As a vegetarian, the menu is extreme extensive and all the dishes are pretty decent. My favourites are the mango salad, pad Thai, basil tofu and green curry. The only thing id recommend staying away from is there desserts which just never seem to hit the spot for me.",

    "text": "A no-frills place: come for the good food and value, not the atmosphere!Recommended!Looking for a quick lunch while strolling on East Coast Rd, and came across this little Thai place. We decided to give it a try despite the low Yelp rating, and we were glad we did!Food:We ordered Thom Yum Seafood soup, Pineapple Rice, a green Chicken Curry, a coffee and lime juice. The soup was delicious, with wonderful lemongrass flavor and a decent amount of prawns, fish, and squid. The green curry was flavorful, as was the Pineapple Rice. I wouldn't hesitate to order these again, but the menu is interesting and I'd love to try other things! The lime juice was just ok, being a bit too sugary for my taste. The coffee was, well, instant. At least the server was up-front when we placed the order.Cost:$24.20, which was very reasonable for the portion sizes. They also have a set menu for lunch that's less ex.Service: They were prompt in taking the order and the food was served quickly. After that, they didn't stop by the table at all.Atmosphere:Quite utilitarian, and could benefit from some attention to the paint and interior design.Overall:I wouldn't hesitate to come back for the food and sample more of the menu!",

Curiously though, the place is packed every time I walk by. Maybe because it's cheap. Not worth it. Really not worth it, even if it's dirt cheap!",

    "text": "Right by the bus stop along East Coast Road, so you can't miss it! What I love about this place is that they have so many options for everyone. Besides the regular menu, they also have a vegetarian menu. And it's not like 3 dishes thrown in as an afterthought. It's a full menu with plenty to choose from. It's rare that a vegetarian is spoilt for choice at a non-veg place, but that's exactly how it is here. You have to ask for the menu as they don't usually present it with the regular menu. My favs are the Beancurd with Pepper and Garlic ($5 for a small portion), and there are like 5 other tofu varieties for you to choose from. They're all good! The tom yum is also mandatory, and there do a really good vegetarian option. So spicy, but not to the extent that it's more pain than pleasure to eat. A small bowl is $5, but I recommend going for the medium at $7. There's a whole lot of vegetables to choose from too, all at $4 or $5. You can have a whole meal with a friend or 2 for less than $20 among you. It's really good value for excellent food. :)Vegetarian Menu: jai-thai.com/menu-vegeta\u2026",

Depending on how hungry I am, sometimes that isnt enough but more often than not, those two dishes are sufficient.Taste wise there really isnt anything to fault Jai Thai. The flavours are authentically Thai and even the simplest dishes are fragrant and tasty. Easy on the wallet too.",

    "text": "This is another place to go for authentic Thai food if you want alternatives to Nakhon Kitchen. In fact, they are cheaper then Nakhon which is already pretty decent in terms of their pricing.Taste-wise, I'd say their style of making Thai food is a bit different from that of Nakhon. I believe that Thai food varies from region to region in Thailand, and that's probably reflected in the differences. The beef they use in their green curry is more stringy, and the curry is less spicy as well.I also tried the fish cakes here, which I thought were superb. Really awesome and in fact I'd say better than Nakhon for this dish.Phad thai and Pineapple fried rice were decent, but nothing to shout about. Tom yum soup was also pretty decent but not the memorable type that you will remember after the meal.",

    "text": "This is a good place for lunch if you are working nearby, since they have a cheap lunch set. It comes with a drink and a dessert and you can choose from 5-6 main dishes like pad thai, chicken curry, tom yum soup, etc. While the a la carte is not very much expensive, the olive rice is rather oily and hardly has much ingredients and condiments as compared to many other thai food places I frequent. There is also a stale oil smell if you eat in. It may not be wise if you are meeting clients after, it gives me a slight headache smelling the stale oil on my clothes for the rest of the day.In spite of all that, I think the tom yum soup is quite good here, spicy enough and has a good balance of lemongrass and sourness. The a la carte dishes are slightly small. They claim a medium can feed 4-5 people but the portion really feeds 3 of us. I'm not sure if it's a difference in eating culture since they service crew there are all petite thai girls. If you live nearby and you don't wish to pay too much, Jai Thai could be the place to go since they are very wallet-friendly as their tag line goes.",
