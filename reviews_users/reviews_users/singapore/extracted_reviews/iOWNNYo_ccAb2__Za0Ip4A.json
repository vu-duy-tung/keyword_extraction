    "text": "This place is seriously underrated. Their charsiew and sio bak are damn awesome and are right up there with the big boys. I only say this as they aren't your usual household name when it comes to roast meats but hey definitely should be!The charsiew has a good balance of caramelised fat and meat. He gives me 2 kinds of charsiew. One more lean and another with the more caramelised note. The internationally charred bits of skin of the charsiew actually held a crunch.The sio bak is by far the BEST I've had in singapore. I dare put my name on the line for this one. The crackling, meat and fat are just crispy HEAVEN in your mouth. Out of all of Singapore... none can match the price and quality of this stall. It's mad.4.9/5 STARS",

    "text": "This place is really a heaven-sent for meat lovers! Their char siew just feels so thick and the bite is just right. Not too dry, not too wet but juicy enough to wake up your senses of indulgence. The roasted pork is also made just fine, so fine. The crispy part and the fatty part and the meaty part just work out so well in your mouth. Unbelievable and indescribable.I didn't get to try the chicken and duck but I heard they are most famous for their duck. Just by trying the two meats above already lets them deserve the highest rating. I look forward to trying their duck and update this review but what a splendid meal of meat over here! Come on all carnivores, over here!",

    "text": "I'm going to cry, this place is SOOOO good. The name Nan Xiang Chicken Rice is misleading because this stall specializes in Roast Pork and Roast Duck.Let me start and end with the Roast Pork. WOW, I mean wow! It's got three layers of heaven: (i) juicy inside, (ii) marbled fatty area \u00a0and (iii) a crunchy skin. However, what separates this Char Siew vs. others is that the skin has got a serious Smokey Finish. The best part of all, the smokey flavour sticks in your mouth up until you eventually brush your teeth! :D \u00a0 Be sure to bring your mints, if you plan to go out on a date afterwards. Word of Advice: To best enjoy the roast pork, DO NOT put any sauce on top. It will dilute the flavor. However, be sure to ask the uncle to put sauce on top of the rice. The separation of rice with sauce and the roast pork is just a perfect complement. \u00a0Lines are obviously long, Locals already know this little secret. The Uncle is as cool as cucumber and has this air of confidence that \"yeah, i'm the man and what I'm serving you is the da bomb diggity!\" \u00a0 \u00a0Badda bing Badda boom and there you have it. The best Roast Pork on the Red Dot bar none!",

Soft succulent pork belly with the perfect crispy skin, tender and juice chicken, and bursting with flavor char Siew! Yum yum yum! I wish it wasn't so close to my house because the temptation is real! The rice is delish too! They tend to run out early (sometimes before 1:30!) so if you don't live/work in the area it can be a real pain in the butt if you miss it. Give it a try and I promise it's worth the risk!",

    "text": "I was hungry, and running late for a meeting in the area, so I thought I'd stop here for a quick lunch... And my decision was made easier by the fact that there wasn't anything in the coffee shop to eat at 2pm, save the very last bits of char siew, siew yoke and some chicken breast... So I got a plate of char siew + siew yoke rice, and sat down to wolf it down.Fate intervened of course, and uncle had generously slapped on my plate some rough cut meats, liberally marbled with soft, juicy fat. As I took a second to admire his handiwork before shovelling it into my now ravenous mouth-hole, I realised the beauty in what lay before me - the rough cut meant he did not stinge on razor-thin slivers, and the chunkier segments offered more bite and flavour, so I could really experience the char in his char siew.Though I did savour each tasty morsel, it was gone too soon, and all I had left was the simple soup to end what was a very tasty meal for just three dollars. Who'd thought you could find such a gem?",

There's like three layers though not to be confused with the three-layered pork (San chen rou) which has a middle layer of pure fats.This charsiew is awesome and it's almost an art to see the stall owner finely slice the meat in front of you, then drizzle it with some sauce and pack it up for you.Now I know why the reviews of this place is so positive. Tried the chicken rice like 5 years ago, but kinda forgot how it tastes. Will come back again for chicken rice add charsiew/roast pork!",
