    "text": "Coming from LA, I was a bit skeptical about eating here because the gyu kaku in LA isn't so good. Cheap, okay quality meat. Upon coming here, I was extremely surprised to see a totally upgraded menu with good quality meats and a variety of dishes. Ordered so much for four people, we could barely finish everything. Australian wgayu platter $230- rib eye, rump cap, sirloin, tongue, etc... Everything was amazing. Melt in your mouth goodness. So much fat and tenderness and flavor...Japanese A3 wgayu- surprisingly not as tender as the Australian. Maybe because it's a3? Still extremely tender though, and more flavor. I actually liked this one better. Seafood platter- pretty full by this point. Comes with giant prawns, scallops, salmon, oysters. It was decent, the prawn was the best. Maybe it wasn't as good because I was already extremely full?Also got the banchan, mushrooms, fried rice, and ice cream to top off the meal. All great compliments to the meal. Overall, best gyu kaku meal I've had. Everything was top notch quality, and it's really difficult to find this type of quality in la. Yum. I am salivating thinking about this meal. Definitely giving gyu kaku in other countries a chance!",

    "text": "Imported Japanese wagyu self-grilled over charcoal. Various cuts of fresh meat are available. In contrast to over-marinated kbbq, yakiniku are unseasoned, thus you can taste the quality of a good cut of meat easily. A good dish to start is the 190g trial platter, which consist of an array of meat cuts. Also worth mentioning was the extremely fragrant garlic fried rice, as well as the juicy kurobuta belly. I would recommend a reservation as the place gets filled fast on Friday/Saturday nights. Definitely worth the occasional splurge.",

Promising an authentic teppanyaki experience, which they pulled off with gusto, Gyu Kaku prides itself on the excellent service together with the freshest ingredients. The wagyu beef is absolutely juicy and well marbled and grilled to perfection. They do a pretty good job with the greens as well, providing a fresh tasting accompaniment to the meats. The ambience was great and though its great for gatherings with large groups of friends (I was there with 6 others), I spotted more couples than groups, which is oddly surprising as I don't find it really romantic.",

    "text": "I was leaving Chijmes with a friend after a business meeting when we walked by this restaurant. Feeling like Japanese BBQ, we decided to have dinner here. It was an authentic Teppanyaki, albeit pricy, meal. The meats were juicy and so, so fresh. If you're here, try the aburi bacon. Don't leave the veggies sidelined; the assorted mushrooms with butter were my favourite accompaniment to the meaty selection. Not much of a chef? Don't worry, they recommend combinations of seasoning for your food. Everything I had went well with Asahi. Service was great, as is usually expected from Japanese culture. The ambience was nice too. We ended up staying there for almost three hours, just the two of us. I'm definitely coming back here, perhaps this time with my foodie family.",

As choice of salad, we requested the Wakame (Seaweed) Salad. All of our cuts of meat, Aburi Bacon, Wagyu Fillet Steak, Wagyu Karubi, Wagyu Rump Cap, Kurobuta Pork Collar, Duck Breast - were well marinated and delicious.The highlights for me would definitely be:- Wagyu Fillet Steak- Duck Breast- Wagyu KarubiThe service was good - offering to mix the rice for us, sort salads and change the grill. This is consistent with the level of service I've found at the Chicago location. I would definitely try to make it back here before I leave Singapore.",

    "text": "Last week I went to Gyu-Kaku at Chijmes for the first time, and it was a great experience!We ordered the premium platter that comes with a variety of different wagyu beef parts. We also ordered more plates of wagyu beef, pork belly and chicken. A waitress took the initiative to barbecue everything for us! Everything was cooked perfectly. When I bit into the beef it was slightly charred on the outside but sooo tender on the inside, bursting with beef juices.It was also my first time eating beef tongue, and it was quite delicious!! I'm not sure if that's because it is wagyu beef, but it tasted so juicy and flavorful and tongue-like actually...but maybe that's psychological.Also, the kimchi soup was the best kimchi soup I've ever had!!!! It's really delicious and a must-try if you love spicy food!! It wasn't too sour like how kimchi usually is, it was more sweet and was served piping hot!I guess the only downside is that it is quite expensive, but honestly you are paying for what you get! If you really have the money to splurge then it is worth it, especially if you like beef.Great ambience, great service and great food!! Overall for 5 people the bill came up to more than $500.Check out my blog (in my profile) for photos :)",

    "text": "This is the price that I am willing to pay for some good authentic Japanese barbeque! If you like Japanese barbeque, you will fall in love with this place. I love the beef here. Juicy, succulent, fresh and tender! The pork is equally good, with many parts of the pig to choose from. Out of curiosity, I also tried the beef tongue. They have a special dip to get rid of the 'bad smell', if any. The texture was pretty special, but the taste wasn't too very outstanding. One thing to note, the price is actually not very friendly to your pocket. It'd probably burn a hole! But for the good food you are paying, outstanding service and environment, I guess it's okay to be nice to yourself occasionally.",
