The seafood ramen is served on a stove with ramen, squid, prawns, mussels and portions are good enough for 2. On previous occasions, I enjoyed the budae jjigae (army stew), fried chicken and mussel pot. Pancake has always been mediocre so you can skip it. I had brought some cake to celebrate a friend's birthday and they kindly helped prepare the candle on the cake and served it with cutlery and plates. This is definitely one of my favourite restaurants for Korean food.They don't serve alcohol after 1030pm.",

This restaurant's Fried Chicken is the best I had by far, big pieces, good marinate, crispy on the outside, juicy inside, and many linds of sauces coating to choose from.Staff are friendly, tho communication may be of a problem as most of them are Korean, which to me I approved! Decor has a pretty homely feel. Located along the \"Korean street\", and opens till 3am, it will be the perfect place to get your fried fix after night of boozing.",

I especially enjoy the Spicy Garlic sauce. \u00a0Wanting it to be more like Chicken Up, I wished there was a boneless option and I wished they offered Truffle Fries. In addition to the fried chicken, we also ordered the Bossam (steamed pork belly) which had a faintly spoiled flavor. \u00a0Even if it were fresher tasting, I'm not sure I would recommend it.As we plowed through the platter of chicken, we were surprised by the music that was blaring too loudly from the speakers. \u00a0I love the F Bomb as much as anyone, but was shocked that they'd be playing songs with such vulgar lyrics in a family restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. \u00a0I shazammed a few of them getting sauce all over my phone in the process. \u00a0See the screen shots below.The Good: \u00a0If you're not going for the chicken, then stay at home!The Bad: \u00a0The vulgar music and the sh*tty PorkThe Verdict: As much as I f**king love KFC, \u00a0I can't say we are looking forward to returning here anytime soon. \u00a0Chicken Up is waaay f**king better!2.5 stars.",

    "text": "Kko Kko Na Ra is a great place to eat with group of friends. The casual, open vibe allows for conversation to flow freely without worrying about being too disruptive to the other guests. The place is well-known for its Korean fried chicken and I certainly understood why. My friends and I got the combo plate, which consisted of the original, garlic, sweet and spicy chicken. I loved all three, especially the sweet and spicy one. They were tender and full of flavour. Apart from that, we also had the leek and seafood pancake, as well as a spicy beancurd soup. The pancake was a little bland and a tad oily, to be honest, but the soup was amazing. It's different from the usual kimchi soup - i believe that some seafood broth was added to the mix to give an added dimension to the flavour (there was a hint of prawn to it). It was definitely spicy, so having it with rice or noodles is highly recommended.",

    "text": "Friday night. 9pm. Singapore's Koreatown is small yet flaming brightly. Not all eateries are busy, but Kko Kko Nara is packed from first to second floor, indoor and out. We end up waiting 40 minutes to seat a party of two. Everyone's here for chicken and alcohol. Both items are pricey yet it's full house; must be worth every penny. We order 8 pieces of Garlic Soy Chicken ($20 SGD) and 8 pieces of Spicy Garlic Soy Chicken (also $20 SGD). For 16 pieces of any of these two types, it'll cost you $35 per set. These prices ain't no American Kentucky Fried Chicken. While I expect the Garlic Soy Chicken to be what it is titled to be: garlicky and pleasantly salty, it is actually sweet. It is as tasty as it is misleading. Texture-wise, the chicken is only half crispy due to the glaze. Admirable trait: it is not too greasy. A side dish of cubed white radish is served to balance the protein. The Spicy Garlic Soy Chicken is same as the Garlic Soy Chicken with the simple addition of spice. I personally prefer the non-spicy version. Inhale that tasty chicken with refreshing Hite beer! LET'S CHIMEK! Thanks to Korean dramas such as \"My Love from Another Star,\" the chimek trend lives on. If you're not familiar with modern-day Korean culture, here's a lesson. \"Chimek\" is the combination of two words: chicken and mekju (beer). Take the first three letters of each word and what do you get? Do the math. CHI + MEK = CHIMEK. There's also the option of drinking Watermelon Soju for $30 SGD. Regardless of the price, you'd be surprised how many customers order it. The Kimchi Jungol comes in two sizes: small for $25 SGD and large for $35 SGD. We order the small with pork and ramen. The stew tastes sophisticated with a pleasant spicy. If you're interested in other stews, they also sell Budae JJigae, Al Tang, Spicy Seafood Ramen, Samgyetang and more. Verdict: I shall return to Kko Kko Nara to try the Original Deep Fried Chicken and Oven-Baked Honey Chicken. The Garlic Soy Chicken would be more tempting if it were more garlicky. IMPORTANT: Kko Kko Nara was once located a street away. Now it is at the following address: 68 Tanjong Pagar Road, Singapore 088489. (The old address was 57 Tras Street, Singapore 078996.)",

I vaguely remember it from my aister's birthday night, so one fine afternoon, I ventured down for their lunch menu.I think the lunch sets are quite good value for the amount of food there is and the fact that it is Korean food. However, it is not great value if you're not easily swayed by the idea of 'foreign food'. 8 pcs of chicken for 15 dollars is quite alot of chicken and I am not embarrassed to say I didn't finish it. The chicken is far too sauce-y (no pun intended) and hard, not just crispy. It was also exceedingly dry and tough which made me tire of chewing after awhile. Honestly, I probably wouldn't ever go back again. I'm quite sure I've had better Korean fried chicken at a family restaurant many years ago, and it doesn't quite match up to that.",

Without the private booths, I felt like having my meal in a food court really. Having to \"accidentally eavesdropped\" on my neighbour's story of the day and what not. Got a table after approx 30mins of waiting. We were here for the fried chicken and beer, hence we ordered quite a lot of different flavors to try, but apart from the spicy garlic soy sauce which was really tasty, the meat itself was tasteless. Definitely tasted different when I last had it a couple years back. Not sure if it's a different recipe, or just because I've tasted wayyy better Korean fried chicken elsewhere, this definitely is a disappointing meal for me. The hite beer however, did compensate(a little) for that.",

My husband I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Chicken and the Spicy Garlic Chicken Wings. The Sweet and Spicy Chicken came out first. Honestly, I was so disappointed. The chicken was cold and the sauce made the chicken even colder. It was horrible. The Spicy Garlic Chicken came out next. This really redeemed them. It was so amazing. You could taste the soy and garlic but it wasn't overpowering at all and the outside was just crispy enough. It was delish! I had to deduct two stars for the first dish though.... Considering it was pretty untouched nobody even asked if something was wrong with the dish. Oh well, 3 stars. I'm feeling generous.",
