    "text": "Who doesn't love Old Hen Coffee Bar? What's not to love? :)I had this vague impression that they opened a new F&B outlet and this one closed down. So, I was actually on my way to Enchanted Cafe (situated next door) and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Old Hen Coffee Bar is still open! It was a quick after-thought visit that let me to pop in at 9.30pm (30 minutes just before they close!). I had a Mocha earlier but I was craving for a good old cold brew served in a bottle - I bought the $6.50 milky brown version and all traces of regrets flew out the window! The right balance of coffee and milk was perfect and yes, I didn't care that I was drinking coffee at 9.30pm!The place, though small, was quite empty save for a couple at the corner on the laptop (plugged in to the wall sockets). The young girl behind the counter was quite cheerful, even though it's so late and that perked my spirits up a little. I've been to Old Hen numerous times while it was packed and where I literally had to jostle for good seats (I love the window bar seats) or get take-away coffee (but then where's the fun in takeaway coffee when you can't enjoy the atmosphere and people-watch?), but the atmosphere two nights ago was just right.Tip: Recommended to go slightly after dinner, or maybe near closing time if you want a quite respite.",

If it's your first time here, do try the creamy white cold brew. ($6.50)The food here is average and worth a try if you're hungry and here for their coffee. The seating area is rather limited, so do note that if you're thinking of camping here with your laptop! That being said, they do have free wifi, power sockets and water as well as a few atas magazines such as the likes of CEREAL for the hipster in you or as a prop for that Instagram flatlay.(Minus that one star as it's hard to find a seat, especially on weekends!)",

    "text": "I can see why my friend likes the waffle here and is a regular visitor to this cafe.I finally made it here after months of hearing the raves about the waffle. I am never a huge waffle fan but this place can change my mind.The waffle is light, crispy (not overly hard/dry) and just so yummy with the greek yogurt and apple compote, crushed pistachios and salted caramel sauce. You have to eat it immediately (within 15 minutes or so) as it does get a bit flat and tiny bit soggy after a while. That means it is not so heavy that you will feel like a ball of dough is inside your stomach. The other crowd favorite is the cold brew white coffee. It is served in a glass bottle like a beer and you can either drink it from the bottle or a glass (ask for it). They do have straws which are too short for the bottle so it will sink. I fold the top of the straw and tuck it inside the bottle neck so it will not fall in. The coffee is creamy milky and not too sweet.There are also some tea cakes in the display case next to the cashier. The lemon earl grey tea cake is nice and again not too sweet. I just find the slices a bit too thin. The menu for food is limited but I think it is good if whatever they have taste delicious. Do well in a few dishes rather than have many choices which are mediocre or bad tasting. I will be back here if I do want to have waffle again.",

    "text": "This place is run and owned by 3 brothers. Twins Ivan and Terry and younger brother Mason. Lovely chaps, friendly, unpretentious and bright, much like the inside of the Old Hen itself.The cold brew is popular. $6.50 for a white served in glass bottles. The date is written on and the printed label says it should be drunk within 10 days. I've had it twice and I don't really drink cold coffee but this was so yummy, I was craving it on the next hot day! 2nd friend 2nd visit - she was also remarking that she normally prefers hot coffee but she was really enjoying this as well. We had one hot one cold to taste test..for your benefit of course.The latte is $4.50, currently from Yellow Bird blend from Oriole Roasters. Second time the microfoam was present, kudos! Both times coffee tasted good anyhow.They had some cakes and a few savoury items only when I first went. They sought some feedback from me and 1st friend on the chicken cheese wrap. They themselves had prewarned us it was small. Glad to see this 2nd trip that the price has been revised to $6.50, down a dollar.I also tried the waffles - friend found it a bit dry. I found it crisp and quite tasty and with the yogurt and blueberries didn't notice the dryness but it could have a bit more fruit though. At $9 for a full 4 quarter waffle, it was reasonably priced.They had a new off menu item they were testing - crabmeat and coleslaw wrap. But they served it to us as a sandwich for a more substantial bite. Crabmeat was tasty and like the chicken cheese wrap, the fillings were perfectly seasoned and very tasty.They seem to be slowly expanding the menu. Very sensible. We also tried the croque monsieur at $7.50 for the 2nd trip. Toasty comfort food on good bread. My friend said she had the croque from DB Moderne recently and this was way better as the DB one was just so salty. I notice a theme here..food is really well balanced, simple but tasty fare. Even the baby spinach salads they serve on the side (nice touch instead of cheaper mixed leaves or lettuce) had dressing that was yummy and just the right mix of sweet and vinegar.Location is good for me so I can see myself dropping by again. I loved sitting by the bar having a chat with the guys and my friend. Don't take my seat!",

    "text": "I came here for a UYE organized by Cindy Q, and I'm glad I came, because I hardly come to this part of Farrer Park.I had a waffle, which I felt was good, nicely browned, and crispy, with yogurt and blueberries. Yum! I did feel a bit meh about feeling forced to order it because I've been trying to go vegetarian for the short term and it was the only non-meat item on the menu. I would have liked a salad with grilled veggies or an avocado sandwich.... just saying.I didn't have the coffee because I am hyper-sensitive to caffeine, but everyone seems to love the cold brew in the glass bottles. I guess part of the novelty is opening bottled coffee bottled by the cafe itself? I dungeddit, but perhaps it really is out of this world.Cindy Q generously ordered some cakes for us to try, along with 2 or 3 other cakes on the house. They ranged from good to okay, but I only would order the banana slice I guess. The red velvet was soso, especially if you are like me - if you like thick cream cheese frosting!Would I come back again? Maybe. It's not too far from the MRT station, and has a cosy atmosphere.",

    "text": "Honestly not sure what the fuss is about.Saw decent crowds in the cafe, so I decided to try it some time. Their brunch menu is pretty standard for a cafe (no proper kitchen, so everything is toasted or pre-made) - waffles, toast, granola, salad, etc. I ordered a Croque Monsiere (ham and cheese on toasted bread) and a matcha milk.The Croque Monsiere was decent, but nothing to shout about. The matcha milk was pretty good (very lightly sweetened and not bitter). However, the cafe itself was small and seating was not cozy, which takes away from the experience. When I'm paying cafe prices, I expect it to be nice, intimate and cosy. It wasn't. They also don't accept credit cards, which is not really acceptable for the kind of food and prices they charge.I've heard their cold brew coffee is good - I'm not a coffee person, so I can't judge that. But based on everything else, I don't think I would go back.",

As we were staying fairly close by for a week we did explore the area a bit and ended up visiting this place and a few others.First things first, the coffee is good. The guys know what they are doing. The cold brew in the bottle is very good, it is available both with milk and balck. For me it is a given that one would not want to ruin it with milk but apparently a lot of people prefer it that way. They also offer a rotating selection of filter coffees. I tried a nice Rwandan coffee but also interesting beans from Bangkok's Roast and some other micro roasters. They do also offer very nice sounding teas and other drinks as well as of course espresso based beverages. Had a very nice grilled sandwich and the cakes looked excellent so no need to go elsewhere for food.The space is nice and fairly cozy, it is a bit small, the seats are not super comfortable and there is no free wifi so perhaps not the place one spends several hours. A really good place for coffee in Singapore and with the friendly service this place is my top choice in the area.",
