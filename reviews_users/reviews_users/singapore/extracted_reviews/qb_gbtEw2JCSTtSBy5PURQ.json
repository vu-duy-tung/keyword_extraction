    "text": "I've tried BonChon in California as well, and I would say this is pretty comparable. We ordered the jap chae and the chicken wings (mix of spicy and regular). Pretty solid. I liked that they divided the spicy and regular so we could tell which was which -- also once of us didn't eat the spicy wings. It was nice that they provided water although it's self-service. They will also give you plastic gloves to eat the wings if you ask. This seems to be more of a trend in Singapore than the US. There are often looong lines here during peak eating hours. We got there around 9:30pm after watching a movie, and they were actually rushing us out right after taking our order since it was closing time.",

    "text": "Was there for dinner because our planned dinner choice moved out from Bugis+. 3 of us, and we settled with beef bibimbap (mixed rice in stone pot), tteobokki (spicy rice cake) and a small chicken combo, half and half.It's a Korean fried chicken wings place, which I set my benchmark high for the fried chicken we ordered. First bite, tasty crispy chicken skin. Next bite, dry and tasteless chicken meat. Poor marination of chicken, and I rarely tasted Korean fried chicken to be like that.Tteobokki was very spicy, but it tasted like sauce over the rice cake. The rice cake tastes blend on its own, and the 2 just doesn't taste together like a dish as one.All 3 of us felt that the beef bibimbap was our best order! It's sooooo good! Slight crispy burnt rice, flavorful sauce, balanced ingredients, and we scrap everything off from the hot stone bowl.Ice water. I hate places that actually serves still water with the \"tap water\" taste. So, meh.Service was normal, quick to serve the food, I like it!Total bill for 3 came up to approx $50, which is okay. But overall I felt that fast food chain kfc prolly sells better korean fried chicken than them at half the price. So, mehhhhh....",

    "text": "Was having cravings for fried chicken and upon hearing about this relatively new Korean fried chicken, we round up a few colleagues to go try it out. Will I go back again? Not exactly, even if It's the only fried chicken option around to satisfy the desperate cravings for fried chicken..We order the Party set of 40 wings (as indicated in the menu) but technically there's only 20 cos it's made up of 20 winglets and drumlets respectively. The skin was crispy but the taste of the marinate is but skin deep. Once the skin is off, the meat has hardly much taste. The other dishes we ordered like the salad was a pathetic portion and pancakes were doughy. I have to say, the food looks good but unfortunately the taste don't measure up. I am sad that I wasted my fried chicken craving on BonChon chicken but at least now I know where not to go when I need a feel good booster! :P",

    "text": "Never in my life have I had wings so dry. The seasoning and sauce used to coat the wings were similar to the original but the chicken was badly prepared. They obviously have misused the double frying technique and it has become an excuse for bad tasting meat. The meat was really dry and stale and it was tasteless. We ordered the Korean seafood pancake because it looked and sounded promising but omg it was TERRIBLE. For S$12.90, this is pathetic. The thin and whitish looking batter barely coats the pitiful strands of scallion and the seafood was non existent. I get better stuff at food courts even. I've tried the famous BonChon wings in NYC but this is nowhere close.",

I had to pay first which was odd in restaurant style set up??My drink came out but not my friends, once I told her this she blamed the other server??Then my salad turned up, all that was in the bowl was salmon which was warm and brown edged lettuce leaves.I told the other server and she was at a loss of what to do and tried to give me another salad. \u00a0However I'd lost my appetite and thought it was extremely poor value and wanted my money back. \u00a0What made it worse is the manager didn't come over she was busy eating with another member of staff which happens here a lot I've \u00a0noticed and I think it's not a great impression of standards to people wanting to eat at a restaurant. Got my money back but would strongly advise anyone not to waste their money here... Pretty dire food and service.",

    "text": "I'd first tried the famous BonChon chicken wings in New York City, where they had earned their reputation as the best chicken wings in America. You can choose between two sauces - soy garlic or hot. \u00a0Known for its double-frying technique, the chicken wings are crispy on the outside yet succulent on the inside. I was hooked. So imagine my joy when I found out they had made their way to Southeast Asia, with outlets in Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia and yes, Singapore! I got to try the chicken wings in Bangkok and was sufficiently convinced that the standard was more or less the same as what I had in New York.Sad to say, I am not a fan of the Singapore outlet at Bugis +. Somehow the frying technique was not mastered, rendering the chicken wings overcooked and dry on the inside. You still get the flavorful blend of soy and garlic marinade on the crispy outside but the pleasure of juicy meat was nowhere to be found.That said, BonChon also serves other Korean fare like bibimbap and bulgogi, as well as sushi and gyoza to go with the chicken wings. I might patronize the outlet one more time but I'm not hopeful. Not after knowing how good it gets in New York City.",

    "text": "The Good: I got the chicken wings with mix and match flavors. Superb crunch and perfect amount of sauce. These are probably the best Korean wings I've had in Singapore so far, though I have to admit, my experience with this particular type of wing is limited (I am a chicken wing connoisseur, having winged all-over the world, but my specialty is the American Buffalo wing and its many variations). Kimchi side was solid, if not stellar.The Bad: I arrived at 9:10 only to be told that they were no longer seating guests because last order is at 9:15 and closing time is 10pm. Whaaaaaat? The guy at the cash register told me their clock was showing 9:15, even when I pointed out that his cellphone clearly read 9:10. I reluctantly ordered take-out, which arrived in under 10 minutes and I was later able to finish my entire meal in 15 minutes. If these guys had followed their own policies and let me eat on location, I would have enjoyed the wings the way they were meant to be eaten, and been out of there before some of the bigger parties even received all of their food. Instead, the wings had turned cold by the time I got home 40 minutes later, annoying me enough to write this griping Yelp review \u00a0(though even cold, they were admittedly still pretty good, mrrmrhm-nyum-mrum...). This was my first visit to a Bonchon, though I've heard great things about their locations in LA and New York. My only response is, with customer service like this--combining Singaporean rigidity with SE Asian haphazardness, which is about the worst combination there is--next time, I'll walk next door to Jinjja Chicken and save Bonchon for when I'm back in the States.",

It's double fried and the skin is SO Crispy and the meat is juicy! BonChon fried chicken is located at Bugis+ (former Iluma). The first time I tried it was in New York and I must say, the taste is almost the same as when I had it over there. Order the set, it's well worth it. If you're going to eat with more than 2 people, order the large set. I usually order it with edamame beans and rice for the sides. Depending on what flavour you like, you can choose between the soy garlic or the spicy. I usually get the mixed as they are both good. If you're going with a big group, you can even get the 40pcs for $39.90. They do have other Korean foods on the menu like Gyoza and stuff, but if you don't try the chicken, it's pretty much a sin.",
