    "text": "This review is long overdue as its been a couple years since I went to Iggy's, but still think fondly about the meal and recommend it to everyone I know who is coming to Singapore. Ive eaten at many Michelin-rated restaurants and I found the vegetarian menu at Iggy's to be exceptional. I was especially blown away by the tomato-garlic \"beer\" - it looked magical and tasted even better. Service was impeccable. I appreciated they allowed us to split a wine pairing between the two of us, as we were worried about having too much to drink and not remembering the meal - ha!I loved that the glass to the kitchen changed so that you could sometimes see the action in the spotless kitchen. The location is a bit odd - its tucked away upstairs in a strange part of the hotel. I recommended just asking someone who works there for directions. My only complain is that the restrooms are outside the restaurant, adjacent to the event space for the hotel. The night we were there it was some kind of prom (?) so the restrooms were chaotic and filled with loud teenagers, while the restaurant was a peaceful, elegant affair. It did make me laugh. :-)Make reservations early - its a small space. You wont be disappointed!",

    "text": "I have always wondered why Iggy's is rated one of the top restaurants in Singapore, yet never got a star in the recent Michelin guide for Singapore...I was taken here on a lazy Saturday lunch for two, and we got the $105 per person 4-course menu. I started with tune tartare on avocado, and it was well-executed, smoky and ocean-tasting enough. I then had the carabineros rice, which was thinly sliced raw carabinero prawns on a red risotto, which must have had some of the tomalley cooked in. This was not to my taste - the bite of the rice was too al dente for me. I had the wagyu flank for the third course, and I did like this, but it was two miserly cubes... Sadness. Dessert rounded off the meal - mango and a coconut sorbet. While it was yummy, it was nothing special.We also had the petit fours which were some macarons and jellies.My favorite bit of the meal was actually the amuse bouche, which included a tomato meringue sandwiching some cheese and basil (meant to be a Caprese salad), which completely surprised me as I bit into it, with its tanginess and complete rounding of flavors from a tiny morsel. What I would have loved to see more of this innovative spirit.I do have to qualify my review, with the fact that the Iggy's chef has now changed, and I had this meal in December 2016 (yes I know my review is a wee bit late).",

    "text": "Frankly was a bit surprised at how much I enjoyed Iggy's despite reading the negative Yelp and blog reviews about the place beforehand. However, the price point is insanely high for flavors that you can find at other a la carte restaurants and for that reason, I would not recommend Iggy's for that perfect date night or family dinner unless you've already tried all the rest of the top SG restaurants and are looking for something new. You are spending the same amount that you would at the likes of Andre, Corner House and Jaan to say the least, each of which provides a very unique experience that you would get ONLY if you went to those particular restaurants - going beyond the \"pay to eat at a fancy restaurant\" mentality but rather to leave you remembering it. Nevertheless, I did enjoy Iggy's but the price point is just too high for the lack of an experience.Iggy's and Les Amis are the last two of the stupid Asia Top 50 List I haven't tried in Singapore so wanted to have a bite at Iggy's.You walk into a dramatic doorway that I thought was really cool followed by a long dark hallway and into a very small dining room with 6 fairly small although comfortable tables. They have a good number of staff so you know you should be well taken care of (they wear their 5 Star Forbes pins prominently). You receive the tasting menu options which you pick either the Gastronomic full 5 course tasting or the smaller 3 course (I believe) as well as the wine/drink iPad. The wine list was very French wine heavy and I felt was lacking as was their cocktail and drink menu. We did do a \"half bottle\" of a nice Spanish Tempranillo, however, where instead of opening a half bottle of wine, they use their Coravin device - something I feel is more appropriate for doing high end wine by the glass rather than saying you are selling a \"half bottle.\" Felt a bit ripped off.We opted for the full Gastronomic Menu and were presented with the following:- Snacks - you get a few pre courses which include a platter with a bunch of charcoal stones where only two are edible. Some kind of potato which was cool but a bit bland of flavor. Then was a sea urchin cone which I thought was a bit fishy (we are big uni fans in any sushi restaurant). Then you get a pretty good oyster covered in squid ink snack. Lastly there was a nice soba noodle topped with caviar and lemongrass that you eat in a single bite along with either a foie gras fried ball or a fried ebi ball (if you don't like foie gras like me).- Hokkaido Scallop Carpaccio - Loved the flavor although something seemed off. I felt that I'm not the biggest fan of how the watermelon and scallop were the same room temperature together but it was beautifully presented and it was a nice concept.- Purple Asparagus - Nice dish and beautifully presented- Smoked Spanish Mackerel - This is served with crab risotto and bonito \"ash\" or powder. I was very happy with this dish and for sure would be something I would order a la carte. Even though I loved this dish, the flavor was not anything revolutionary - it was a nicely done fish on top of risotto.- For the main course you have the option of a rabbit stew ($225), lamb ($250) or Hida Waygu Striploin ($275) where I'm sure the majority of people would opt for the latter and better sounding option. We did that and we were definitely happy with that option. We loved it.- For dessert they had a pretty incredible looking \"Strawberry\" - a huge red sugar coated and crafted strawberry looking thing that was REALLY COOL. Inside of this thing (see picture) was milk ice cream, shiso and tomato. That's where my problem was - why for a beautiful creation like this that's supposed to be that perfect dessert would you have TOMATO AND SHISO??? Something was off about it and that was exactly it. Cool idea except if it's called Strawberry, I was expecting a really cool Strawberries and Cream that didn't come to surface.-They had a second dessert which was really cool and was a jackfruit ice cream sandwich which I thought was really nice and creative. Love when restaurants use local ingredients and flavors.Fortunately I didn't get any of those courses that I saw from previous Yelpers that looked like someone randomly through a bunch of crap on a dish randomly and presented it as a course. All of my courses were very nicely presented.Coffee and tea are included in the meal which was another cool perk.Service was great and I had no issues with the environment or tableware as another has mentioned. It was very comfortable.I enjoyed myself during this meal but for this price point, I really would not recommend Iggy's. It just wasn't memorable as other Yelpers mentioned. It will be interesting to see what Michelin does with this one next month.",

The service was fine, but I'm indifferent towards the ambiance and disappointed by the food. Iggy's has about 10 tables and half these tables were empty--it felt as if I was dining in a deserted restaurant...or a library. There was no music! Hence, Manfriend and I felt like we needed to whisper the entire meal. We ordered the gastronomic 7 course...meh. Out of the 7 dishes, we only enjoyed 2. The first was the burrata with tomato and the second was a striploin, flown in from Japan. You cant' go wrong with these dishes...all the others, the sea urchin, foie gras, tile fish, snacks...forgettable. For a meal over $700, I expected much better.",

    "text": "For a fine dining establishment, I expected top notch service such as napkin placement when you are seated, napkin folded when you leave your seat, and a better explanation of each dish. \u00a0BIG PEEVED: the gentlemen next to us, used his cell phone twice, w/the second call put on speaker. I expect the staffs to note this inappropriate behavior and would ask the guy to take his phone call outside. It's like would you take a call during the movies? I expect a story for each dish but got a generic summary of the list of ingredients. For example, the garden plate had 20 vegetables imported from Japan. Each vegetable was scattered throughout the plate. Was I suppose to mix the vegetable w/the watermelon burrata gazpacho? Or, eat each vegetable individually? If I should eat each vegetable individually, where do I start? Presentation for this dish was a hot mess (see pic).Next dish: uni w/seared scallop green pea soup. The protein in this dish was good by itself but the pea consume broth fell flat. The slimy texture from the eggplant and the blanched peas was a bad combination put together. Onto Iggy's signature dish is the Cappellini with sakura ebi. Nothing UMAMI about this dish except that is was under season. Final dish is the duo wagyu with the poached squid ink egg and black truffle. This was the only dish that was good, and was gastronomist for the '$275 gastronomist' prefix dinner. The Japanese and Australian wagyu were cooked well, and I admire the skilled to deep fry a poached egg in squid ink. The shaved truffle enhanced the natural flavors of the beef.The gratin lychee Japanese melon dessert was better than the main dessert. The main dessert reminded me of a blood splatter scene from Dexter (see pic). Overall, save yourself the money and book elsewhere. Or, treat yourself to a Hermes bracelet. Bad planning on my part.",

    "text": "Iggy's wears many hats - top restaurant in Singapore, best 50 in the world.. etc. Unfortunately I don't find it quite deserving the hype. Maybe its was the wrong occasion - we came here for Valentine's day. The menu was different from their normal tasting. It was six courses, tho we couldn't find some of the classics, such as the \"rock potatoes\" on the menu. Here are the six courses:1. Snacks 2. Double belly (raw toro belly + pork belly)3. Lobster ravioli4. Mackerel and brussel sprouts5. Wagyu duo (Japanese and Australian)6. Dessert - Red hot molten passion.One thing I noticed in many dishes is their love for playing with the texture. For example, one of the snacks consisted of jello(I think cucumber?), avocado, and crab meat. A very similar combination was repeated later in the meal. The cooking method in most dishes are more traditional and classic, we didn't get much foamy, decomposed, or reconstituted ingredients. In terms of highlights during the meal, for me they were the double belly and double wagyu. I might be biased because toro and pork belly are two of my favorite things in the world. The pork belly dish came out in a wrapped up plastic bag, a specially material that can withstand up to 200 degree of heat. To taste, they first cut into the bag to let the aroma out. With black truffle, asparagus, and a clear chicken broth, the aroma truly stimulate your senses. The other dishes were a bit lackluster. Their homemade ravioli wasn't thin enough, the mackerel was a bit salty and nothing special. The other thing we didn't like was their pace of serving. Interval between courses were very short that we feel like we constantly have food in front of us. I am having a hard time justify the cost of the meal. For the same price (or a bit higher), we used to find much worthier meals in the States - Alinea, Eleven Madison, Le Bernadin. Not sure if we will be back.",

    "text": "KenScale: 8.0/10In the middle of April, I visited Singapore with my brother and had an opportunity to check out some of the top restaurants there. Singapore is quite a gastronomic juggernaut in Asia. You can sample various local food (drawing from the influences of China, Malaysia and India) in the so-called hawker centers around the city, and the presence of affluent people means that there are also quite a few high-end places featuring unique haute cuisine. My first stop was a lunch at Iggy's, which has long been one of the top restaurants in Singapore. Located at Hilton Hotel, Iggy's features globally influenced cuisine drawing inspirations from Europe and Japan. Overall, I had a pleasant meal at the restaurant.For lunch, you can go with three-course menu (starting at S$85 per person), four-course menu (starting at S$105 per person) or go all-out with signature tasting menu (starting at S$105 per person). I opted for the four-course menu, which consists of tuna tartare, spaghettini, a main course of pork, wagyu or lamb and a dessert (the restaurant had three options to choose from). The first course of tuna tartare started out with a bang. I was startled to see the smoke emanating from the mascarpone cheese that accompanied the dish, but the cold texture was quite unique and worked fabulously with tuna. Spaghettini that came with crab and tomato was an above-average pasta dish that had very nice balance of flavor. The main courses were somewhat underwhelming, although by no means bad. My brother and I ordered wagyu and lamb, each accompanied by grilled vegetables of shiitake, potato, nanohana, tomato and lotus root. While wagyu was very nicely cooked, I felt the seasoning was somewhat uneven. Lamb, on the other hand, had texture that was tougher than I had expected. For desserts, we proceeded to share berry & berries that came with cheese, milk and cherry, a very light and refreshing dish, and kaya & the tarik with Ceylon tea flavored ice cream that was quite pleasant and soothing. The restaurant has a formal but not stuffy vibe with professionally dressed and attentive staff. There are some nice wine selections (although I was surprised to see the stiff price for a glass, which runs at around S$30 per glass). Overall, Iggy's had some nice dishes with unique gastronomic concepts and deserves a visit when you are in Singapore.",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner date at Iggy's.I want to say this was a true dining experience. \u00a0it was very enjoyable. \u00a0Is it a top fifty restaurant in the world experience? \u00a0I sincerely doubt it. \u00a0However, someone thinks so and whether it is or isn't doesn't diminish from the experience we had.tinyurl.com/c3golwvAmbiance - There is something a little mysterious about entering Iggy's \u00a0It also seems like there are alternate areas. \u00a0The space we were in was a mid to small square room. \u00a0It actually had the feel of a temporary space. \u00a0it was quite nice. \u00a0But, it didn't really have a feel of cohesion. \u00a0I am certainly not sure why they selected the 60's/70's style swivel chairs.Service - The service was excellent. \u00a0I truly mean excellent. \u00a0It was reserved. \u00a0It was calculated. \u00a0It was precise. \u00a0The meal moved at a very controlled pace with each dish accompanied by a whispered description. \u00a0 They also agreed to substitute for the foie gras course. \u00a0I choose not to eat it. \u00a0Recently, my dinner date has been doing the same.Food - The food ranged from very good to excellent. \u00a0This is a very varied dining experience. \u00a0I do not think it can be expected that each person is going to necessarily find each and every course to their specific liking. \u00a0However, you can appreciate the execution and quality of ingredients for each dish.I am not going to try to critique each dish. \u00a0 I think there is a great deal of personal taste involved in traversing a varied menu of this type.They offer two set menus. \u00a0We each selected the Dinner Gastronomic ($276 per person), \u00a0There is also a lighter version, Dinner Tasting ($195 per person). \u00a0You can also select a vegetarian set menu. \u00a0 One note, each person has to order the same set course. \u00a0This was not an issue for us but it could have been. \u00a0It is something to keep in mind.I will now list the courses and provide links to the Yelp photos for each course. \u00a0 I have marked my five favourite non-dessert courses with \u00a0an \u00a0(*) and my favourite dessert course with an (+).*1st course - Snow crab, banana & 2nd course Somen, caviartinyurl.com/c2kkk4t3rd course - Iggy's Sushitinyurl.com/c6r79ht4th course- Nasi Lemaktinyurl.com/bokt8on5th course - Gillardeau Oyster (Tomato gazpacho, caviarroli, fine herbs)tinyurl.com/cd8sl3m*6th course - Chlorophyl (Sean and soil salad)tinyurl.com/cawngb37th course - Sea Urchin (Turnip, Alba black truffle)tinyurl.com/cllpsww*8th course Sakura Ebi (Cappellini, shellfish oil, konbu)tinyurl.com/br4nths*9th course Red Rockfish (Vegetable brunaise, Jamon Iberico, sudachi)tinyurl.com/c9zzuqq*10th course Wagyu (Nanohana, nasu)tinyurl.com/bm84j92+ Dessert #1 - Forest Berries (Campari, blood orange, mascarpone)tinyurl.com/c5m4qhlDessert #2 - Pumpkin (Spiced sponge cake, chocolate, pecans)tinyurl.com/c84ykxuDessert #3 - Hinoki Chocolate Box (Selection of home-made chocolates and macaroons)tinyurl.com/cm4fq3pReceipt ($946.31 for two people)tinyurl.com/d5uhzk4Overall - The food is extremely good and the presentation is consistently beautiful. \u00a0The ambiance is very nice but lacked some cohesion. \u00a0It felt a little like a catered \u00a0banquet room. \u00a0The service was truly exceptional. \u00a0I went back and forth on whether this was a five star or four star experience. In the end, I am sure there are reasons others chose to withhold the fifth star. \u00a0I have decided that I can see no true reason not to provide them with a five star rating.",

No natural lighting inside so no view. Wait staff were impeccable. They have their wine list on an iPad which is cool .",

(-1 star)The service was excellent (for singapore, my water glass spent a fair amount of time empty) , and the food solid but there are many better tasting menus at the price. \u00a0The dishes were solid, but not that creative. \u00a0Also the execution of a few were unimpressive (overcooked wagyu). \u00a0I get the impression that the staff and chef are resting on their laurels.this isn't to say it was a bad meal by any stretch, but at ~$275pp there's no excuse for any mistakes",

    "text": "Despite being renowned and celebrated internationally, I found Iggy's underwhelming. The ambience was stuffy and prissy, much like dining with the Queen. That was far from enjoyable. To compound its stodgy, chi-chi vibe, the food was inventive but contrived, delicious but soulless.We had the extravagant but substantive $275 11-course dinner: 1) Stone and Pate - comprised a couple of baby potatoes, skins-on and charred into a stone-like appearance, sided by a truffle mayonnaise dip. Served amongst a bunch of actual smoothened stones, it's quite the inspired plating. 2) Octopus Carpaccio showered with edible flowers and snow: delicate and evoked memories of a crisp winter's morning, just after the first snowfall.3) Mushroom Consomme dotted with shimeiji caps, and floating above a smooth egg custard: comforting and lovely4) Burnt Scallop -encrusted in an inky casing, revealed a plump succulent scallop: well-balanced against a curried tomato sauce.5) Toro Sashimi, with beetroot, arugula, baby carrot, mascarpone powder: a wonderful medley of the sweet, peppery, creamy and bitter.6) Anago with green pea, fava bean, and urui: uneven, the nutty undertones of the greens did little to compensate for the overwhelmingly fishy eel.7) Spaghetti, with shirako, kujo-neghi, sansho, and yuzu: the fish overwhelmed its delicate counterparts, and copious lashings of yuzu zest and fresh leek failed to save the day.8) Wagyu: absolutely sublime, complemented by a capered jus laced with alba black truffles. This was accompanied by grilled fat stalks of white asparagus, new potatoes and shitake.9) Kurobuta Pork: glorious as well, with nary a whiff of that \"porky smell\", lush and fork-tender.",

    "text": "Unimpressed. Came here for my bday dinner celebration with hubby, but we should've just revisited Jaan instead. We opted for the Gastronmic Menu at $275/person (the menu can be found online), and other than the \"burnt oyster' dish, everything else on the course menu was uncreative and just not. that. good.enough. for a restaurant of its standing. \u00a0We probably had similar and better dishes at casual restaurants. Located in a run-down hilton hotel next to Far East Plaza, the location is meh, though the interior decor of the place was private and classy and perfect for a special celebration. and this is not a big deal, but i didn't like it that the bathroom was located OUTSIDE of the restaurant to be shared with other hotel visitors. You charge fine dining price, and while I will not expect a towel lady to be present to hand out my hand towels as they do in many of Seoul/New York fine dining, I expect the bathroom to be inside the restaurant, easily acessibie, and with similar classy decor. Other turn-offs:-I told the waitress no-alcohol in any of the dishes for personal reasons. She said Plum Soda in one of the dishes has alcohol in it, and that she'd have it replaced with something else. And yet, there it was, Plum Soda along with my other dish. The waitress quickly apologized and brought out another dish. -Our wagyu was not tender; it was tough and chewy.-The waiter that explains each of our courses changed each time. Sometimes it was a girl, then it was a guy, then it was another guy, and most of the time, I couldn't really make out what they were saying. The girl was more helpful than the men that served us, though.-It was obvious they forgot it was my birthday, although my hubby stated it in the email exchanges in making our reservation. When my husband asked for the check and finally asked about the whereabouts, the waiter lied and said it'll be out in another minute. After we get our check, really? At least be honest about it. Then I go see him talking to another waiter in a hurry, and it took another 15 min for us just waiting around for them to bring out some pathetic little chocolate ball they called a bday dessert with a lit candle. Fail.-Not a big deal, but their bread and chocolate selections are not expansive. and they only come around once. Yes I really miss the real fine dining back at home. Finally, one thing that really annoys me about Singapore's fine dining in genereal is that they are so stingy with their portions and they nickel and dime you. Portion-wise, I understand. This is Asia and I don't expect you to fully satisfy me as New York fine dining does for their diners truly looking for a dining experience (though you charge as expensive). But the fact that they come over during mid-meal and ask us if we'd either like Coffee or Tea, and THEN CHARGE US for it (not sure how much, around 8~15 per cup?) is beyond ridiculous. I ordered a course meal and in that, a tea and/or coffee should be included, as it is in all the other fine dining I've tried across America and Korea. We got hit with their sneaky tactic last time at another Singapore fine dining so we made sure to ask if it was complimentary, which it wasn't. Pretty sad that they try to nickel and dime you when it's usually something that accomapnies desserts in course meals. Or seriously, don't come over randomly and ask me if i want something if you are going to charge me for it.Iggy's was supposely voted one of the top 50 best restaurants in Asia, and prior to our dinner we were wondering why it hadn't earned a Michelin yet. Now we know. the end.",

    "text": "It's hard to proclaim any restaurant in Singapore as \"the best\" if you haven't yet tried Iggy's. For many, Iggy's sets the bar for top tier dining locally, and really it's not difficult to see why.The food here is not only delicious and well executed, but it's witty, intelligent, and very often pleasantly surprising. I don't mean the cheap gimmicks like the rehydrating finger towels that expand upon the additional of water that starts off your meal... no. I mean little surprises like the White Chocolate Truffle actually being scented with truffles. There are other little surprises that you'll encounter through the meal that play with your expectations and ideas of what a dish should be like, but I won't spoil any of the other surprises here.Service was actually a little lacklustre here, staff weren't incredibly well versed in their wine list, there were little lapses in attention, but at Iggy's the food often makes up for any shortfall anywhere else. Expect to have your tastebuds tickled and your senses toyed with, but do not expect that any complexity of flavour or execution of technique will be compromised as a result. Everything at Iggy's is elegantly done, and even with the dinner costing over $400 a head, we still felt it was very much worth it.",

    "text": "I have wanted to go to Iggy's for a long time, especially since becoming aware that this restaurant in little Singapore is among the World's 50 Best. I was extremely lucky to be given a lunch treat at Iggy's last Thursday, and I'm glad to say that it lived up to the expectations. The decor is all slick black and very minimalistic. The staff is present but not in your face. The 4-course menu offers good variety, though I find it quite meat-centric. We started with an amuse bouche of Tomato Essence, with foam of tomato, tomato concasse & tomato/bell pepper cream. It was smooth, refreshing and flavoursome. I had the Gillardeau Oysters with Caviar, and my friend had the Foie Gras. Both were truly sublime. Main courses were Wagyu with Madeira Sauce and I had the Pigeon with Lentils, very classic. The pigoen is well cooked, though I find the accompaniment of cooked beetroot and beetroot puree a little on the sweet-side. Dessert of Kaya & Teh Tarik was a little disappointing. The dish was somehow a little disjointed. My Forest Berries with Campari jelly, blood orange sorbet with mascarpone was on the other hand, very balanced flavours.Having eaten in other restaurants in that list in Europe, it's hard not to compare. However, would it be fair? Probably not. The cooking is definitely well executed and service is faultless. Plus the fact that they served a really yummy sparkling sake that was delicious with the oysters. I would not hesitate to recommend the restaurant.",
