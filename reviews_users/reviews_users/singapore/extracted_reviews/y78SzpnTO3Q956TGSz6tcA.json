Our Thai friends introduced us 6 years ago (which just proves how authentic and good it MUST be!) and we've been going regularly ever since. We bring all our guests and visitors, and they all agree on how wonderful E-Sarn is!The service is wonderful and friendly, and extremely fast! As soon as we order, it's almost at our table instantaneously.Our favourite dishes are the sun-dried pork, clear tom yam seafood soup, fish cakes, cha om (thai vegetable omelette) as well as the mango salad, and have become our regulars when we pay our visits. We've never found another Thai restaurant in Singapore that tops E-Sarn, and honestly, that's fine, as we love E-Sarn and would not trade it for anything!",

    "text": "Good place for Thai food. Nice restaurant setting and location if you want to get away from crowded shopping malls. Located just across the road from pasir Panjang mrt station. Two girlfriends and I shared a large pad thai, minced chicken with chili and omelette with minced pork. The pad thai has the right amount of gravy and taste. The minced chicken came in a decent portion and was not too spicy. The star was the omelette which was super crispy and addictive. My friend also enjoyed the coconut drink. It's a pity that the mango desserts were not available during our visit.",

    "text": "This restaurant is managed by a team of Thai staffs so the food is expected to be good.My most recent trip was on Monday with my husband and a friend of mine. We initially ordered the green curry, grilled pork salad and stir fried kang kong. However, after seeing how tiny the portions were, my husband quickly added another order of basil minced pork.Green curry looked more yellow than green but it tasted pretty good. Kang kong was ok. It was fresh with the spicy kick. Grilled pork salad: I think the taste is altered to cater to the numerous expats living in the area. Typical Thai salads, or \"yum\", usually have strong sour and spicy taste. However the dish is rather mild (and also lacks the aromatic crushed rice bits).Minced pork and basil: I'm utterly disappointed with this dish. It doesn't look anything like a basil minced pork. It's more like the chef accidentally threw in an entire bottle of Chilli paste. Ironically, the dish doesn't come with much basil. I highly recommend that they change the name of this dish to stir fried minced pork with Chilli paste. The 4 items, 2 Thai ice teas, and 3 rice portions cost us 75 dollar. I don't remember it being so costly but I guess that's because it's been quite some time since I last came here. That said, it will be another long while before I come back here again. It's too painful to part with my money knowing that there are better and cheaper places to visit.",

The grilled pork is very tasty, the fried fish with green chili is crunchy. The gai lan is good. The green curry & tom yum are good as well. Food is overall very satisfying. Minus one star for being so far down south and a little on the pricey end for Thai food. For the price I paid for 5 dishes ($150), you may fly a return flight on budget airline when it is on sale to BKK. Hahaha It is also a place that is frequented by many expats. I didn't know Pasir Panjang is quite popular with the expats.",

    "text": "Definitely a fan! Other outlets are at Ridgewood, Thomson, Tanjong Katong and Robertson Quay and now there is also one close to my office!!Well close...it's actually a 10 minute walk from the nearest MRT station through a blistering heat. Then most of the time I get there, there is only a place outside for me to sit. Most people leave office around 12 for lunch in the neighboring offices, meaning they arrive there at 12:15-12:30, that's when the place start to get packed. For a reason though, because the food is just so good! E-sarn never fails to let me know if I grave for pad thai or green curry (although I don't really know what the figs are doing inside the curry and none of my collegues seem to eat them as well). They have a good set lunch menu for 7.90, see picture! Service is fast as well. The mango sticky rice with icecream on top is just heaven, but the same price as the set menu all together so take note. All together, great place to have lunch, but beat the crowd!",
