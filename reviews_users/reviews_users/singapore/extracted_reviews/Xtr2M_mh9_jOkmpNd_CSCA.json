I would always ordered roasted fatty salmon/roasted salmon , crab meat chawanmushi , mango lobster roll , unagi . They just renovated and the queue system is more effective now . The lowest I've eaten altogether is about $30+ . It's worth it as the sushi/sashimi is so damn fresh ! And is imported from Japan ! Come and try it ! (:",

    "text": "After the newest Itacho outlet at Jcube has opened, we consumers now have 5 Itacho locations to choose from! Hooray!Itacho is one of my favorite places to have sushi at. They use really fresh ingredients, and the variety of sushi is pretty wide. But on the down side, if you want to have something besides sushi, like say ramen or soumen, Itacho is probably not the place for you. Also, the portions served here can be quite small if you are considering to share. For instance, one order of sashimi is only 3 slices. I do wish that they have an option for 5 slices! My personal favorite is the fatty salmon sashimi. Fresh, and taste so much better than the regular salmon! Their yaki tamago comes in my flavors too! A pretty good side order to go along with the sushi. Anyway, the queue at the Orchard Ion outlet can be quite crazy sometimes. So do go at those off peak hours, or be prepared to wait quite a while.",

    "text": "As a great fan of sashimi, this is my ultimate go to place for a sashimi fix. This place flies in their sashimi from the famous Tsukiji Market in Tokyo twice a week, namely on Tuesdays and Fridays, which explains the ever fresh quality of the sashimi. But what really bought me over was the warm rice each sushi was served with. Popular places like Sakei Sushi and even Sushi Tei always serve their sushis on conveyor belts, hence the cold rice, but Itacho never fails to serve their sushi rice warm. It felt like I was back at a little non-descript sushi bar at Tsukiji myself all over again. All this at really decent price! I really cannot go on more about how worth it the sashimi and sushi is here. It is a hands down 5 stars for me. But bewarned: because of how good this place is, the average waiting time in the rush hour queues are usually about 20-30 minutes. A worthwhile wait? I'd say definitely!",

Itacho is the sweet spot between the fast food style sushi restaurants and your much much higher end ones like hamachi.",

Its appeal lies primarily in its excellent location right smack at the connected walkway between Wheelock Place and ION, and its superbly fresh sushi. My heart however, was won over by the very well executed range of roasted / aburi sushi.Food : OMG the aburi salmon belly and wagyu beef sushi. Out of this world. The chawanmushi topped with crab was pretty yummy and the unagi don was so-so.Just order the aburi selections. Honestly.The good thing about this place is that it allows you to order just one sushi (instead of the prerequisite 2 a plate at most other establishments) so one can try more without being too full.Ambience : Chirpy and speedy like most casual Japanese restaurants. The queues are mad at peak dining hours though.Service : Speedy waitstaff and love the friendly chefs.'cuse me while I go grab my aburi sushi. Again.",

But we just returned from the land of Yelp and my son had a hankering for sushi. I wanted to try something new so I went for the first recommended place on Yelp. I should have read the reviews but I was feeling lucky. Any sushi place that is known for it's salmon sushi (all farmed, I'm sure) is not the place for me. This is a typical Singapore- or Chinese-style sushi place with plenty of fake wasabi, 100s of items on the menu (including every imaginable salmon sushi dish) that you order by the number not by the Japanese name, and waitresses who can't answer any of your questions. The food wasn't terrible but it's just not good sushi.",

Itacho is now my favourite mid-range Japanese restaurants for sure, due to its fresh ingredients, sensible pricing, and great ambience.Where else can you find sushi for as low as S$0.40? It's not some cheap lousy sushi either. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients.I always like to sit at the counter to look at the chefs do their stuff whenever I visit a Jap restaurant, and I wasn't disappointed. The seats here are comfortable without being too high, and gave me a nice view.If, however, you're after anything other than sushi, such as ramen, then Itacho is perhaps not the place to go.",

ZOMGThe argument against: the service. I was there on a Sunday afternoon, past the lunchtime rush. There was a queue, though that moved quite quickly. It's after getting seated that things went downhill--there seemed to be plenty of waitstaff, except I couldn't find them, so ordering took a while. What I found really unacceptable though was that seated at the counter, I could see that the chefs worked quickly. Unfortunately, the sashimi and sushi would languish at the pass, drying out while they waited for a waiter to notice them. That disrespects the food, and is not ok in my book.",

Occasionally it has tasted like rubber.The quality of the sashimi/nigiri can't compare to top notch Japanese restaurants' naturally but is fairly good for the price.

The concept is pretty cool, you download the app using their wifi and you basically have a catalog of the food items. You choose what you want, snap a pic of the table code and out comes the food and bill. The sushi is fresh and I liked all of it. My favorite is the squid and salmon. I could have ordered a ton more but the ion mall had so many snacking places I wanted to try, so you may want to save room. The table setups are neat, everything is in a secret hidden drawer under the table.Restrooms are a walk aways, so be sure to use it before hand.While it is a unique concept I can see problems if you don't speak English or mandarin, explaining to a foreigner without a smart phone.

All the rolls came with tamago in the centre. The white fish came with a spicy green topping that was pretty good. The salmon was raw but seared on the top. It was a bit too tough. The last had small fish on it. It was rather plain.At least each piece was quite big so it was rather filling. It came up to $14 for 7 pieces of sushi. Very average though.

Along the way our group of people streamed in and all arrived together at 730pm.  Just when we were about to order our food, we were told that because we had not made any reservations, we need to give up our seats and join the queue again because the group of 10 that made a reservation has arrived.  What puzzles me was when we were led to the table, your service staff did not ask who made the reservations and led us to our table immediately.  And after sitting an hour and on a hungry stomach ready to order, we were shooed out of your restaurant just so that the previous party of 10 that made reservations could have our seats.  Best of all, we were told to join the queue right at the end. As you would be aware, 730pm outside your restaurant there would be a queue definitely. Yesterday, there were at least 15pax in that queue at that time.  The situation was handled badly by your service staff and we were made to leave your restaurant and take our business of eating out somewhere elseWorst experience ever!!!!",

Besides the lunch sets, they still do selected items at greatly discounted prices.From the menu I always ordered the aburi (roasted) fatty salmon and aburi (roasted) scallop. These two are the must order in my opinion. From the discounted sushi menu, I like the smoked duck sushi. It is something different and is actually quite tasty. The soy salmon sushi is also good and at $0.40 (I think, definitely under a dollar), it is a good deal. The chirashi is also decent for that price.",

The food came out at a nice pace and wasn't too expensive. I wish I lived in Singapore, for many more reasons than this place, but this place showed me that you can squeeze quality sushi into a mall. I suggest you eat here.",

    "text": "This is more a 3.5 for me, since the quality of the sushi is pretty good; however, the service and prices bring it down to an official 3 star rating.The line (or queue... ah, what the hell, I don't speak the Queen's English so I'm keeping it as line!) for this place is quite daunting. It always snakes around no matter what time of day it is. So what's the big deal?Well, the sushi is very fresh, but affordable? Not so much. If you love sushi as much as I do, it'll cost you a pretty penny. Between my husband and I, we can drop $75-100 for lunch here (and that's me being conservative. I usually have some room in my dessert pocket when I leave.)Also, the service can be really spotty. Due to overwhelming demand, it's really hard to get a server's attention once all the tables are filled. (Then again, we always seem to get seated at the corner of the sushi bar- not sure if this is a factor to consider.) I recommend ordering EVERYTHING you want all at one time, because if you want seconds on anything, it's really going to take a while to flag someone down and to get it to your table. In my rookie days, I tried doing a second round by ordering one sushi roll, and it took about 20 minutes to receive it. Lesson learned.So the takeaway from your (honorary) Sushi Sensei* is- arrive early, order all at once, and be prepared to spend that ca$h money!*Believe it or not, I still haven't earned the Sushi Sensei badge on Yelp. How many more sushi places do I need to sit through?!",

Food was decent but kind of pricey for what you get. Staffs were unfriendly and not knowledgable enough. My overall experience just wasn't great. The fish here is not very fresh and not of a high grade. The sushi rice is also lacking in flavor, is cold and is packed too tight. I'm not sure if this place used to be good, but it is not at the present time. There are a number of other revolving or value sushi places that I would go to in town before going here: Ryoshi Sushi Ikeikemaru and Sushi Bar are the two that pop into mind.",

The fatty salmon sushi is simply amazing when you dip it with their wasabi sauce. Heavenly! I always have at least 6 plates of it for each visit. Not forgetting to mention its scallop sushi. You can really taste the freshless and the sweetness of the scallop on it.Some of the dishes are on the expensive side but definitely worth it for those who appreciate good sushi.Lastly, i would like to comment on the seating. There is too limited seat in the restaurant. Therefore, customers usually have to wait for about 20-30mins queueing time before going in. I will be thrilled if only they are able to expand the restaurant.But still, Itacho is one of my favorite places to have sushi at. They use really fresh ingredients to make excellent sushi.",

    "text": "I had the chance the head to both branches of Itacho Sushi - one at Plaza Singapura and another at Ion - both with different bunch of friends for different occasions but the same good sushi. I was lucky enough not to have to suffer the wrath of long queues as many reviews have spoken of all the times I've headed to the joints.A side menu shows that some dishes are permanently on offer. One of it being the soy salmon sushi ($0.40). One thing awesome about the sushi at Itacho is that they are grilled with a blow torch which gives a slightly charred taste to the meat but retains the juiciness of the fats. Same goes for the grilled pork sushi ($1.00).The roasts selection is my favorite of the menu. In the world of steak, these would've been medium rare with the meat slightly seared on the outside with retaining the sweet sashimi goodness inside. We had dorsal (highly recommended by my friends), scallop, salmon, mackerel, and it all became a blur of just really good sushi after a while.It was a whole load of fun picking out random sushis to eat at Itacho and it helps that everything was well-prepared. I am happy to say too that both branches appears to serve food of the same standards. The bill didn't come out to as much as we expected but do take note that Itacho Sushi is slightly pricier as they serve sushi in singular pieces. Overall, a happy and satisfying meal at an unpretentious joint.",

    "text": "Dining at Itacho today always leaves me a little wistful, but once upon a time, this chain was undoubtedly 4, maybe even 5 stars. Things like uni freshness is no longer consistent, fish freshness isn't as top notch, and the range of dishes has changed slightly. Overall though, Itacho is still my go-to casual sushi chain. While most people describe Itacho was 'affordable', it's not. Not really. At (mostly) minimum $2 a sushi (yes, that's per piece), that comes out to a lot if you're the hungry sort. On average, I spend about $60-70 dollars a head there. Other than that though, the sushi at Itacho is generally great. There's an excellent variety of less common fish, and I love that I can get sea bream, mackerel, yellowtail, fatty yellowtail, swordfish, binchou tuna, all in one place. On top of that, they serve ankimo (cod fish liver), have decent tempura, and I always have one of their chawan mushi with salmon roe to start of any meal. Coupled with their selection of aburi sushi, there's really everything to love about this chain.I will however, temper all my love with the following advice. For higher price items, like the sea urchin/uni, tread carefully. While the freshness of uni at Itacho is generally great, in the... what, 10 times I've had uni there, two times the uni wasn't fresh. And uni that isn't fresh is really, really, hard to eat. It leaves a pungent, unpleasant aftertaste that no amount of rice or green tea will get rid of. So generally, avoid the uni-mini rice item, and go for a uni gunkan (warship) if you have an uni craving. The smaller portion means that if this batch isn't fresh, you lose less. Even that single gunkan will set you back about... what, eight dollars though, so yeah. A word of warning.What most people also don't realise is that Itacho takes reservations. Call at least 2-3 before 6pm, and you can make dinner reservations. All they require is a minimum spend of $150 dollars for parties of 3-4 persons I think. (If you're not confident hitting that mark, then drop me a message. I'll be happy to help.)Oh. Last point. Don't go to the Changi airport branch. I found the fish, and uni, MUCH less fresh than all the other outlets. I suspect it's the lower turnover of ingredients, but personally, I was way disappointed with that branch.",

You add the fact that Itacho sells the fatty salmon at bargain prices relative to some high priced Japanese dining establishments, you have yourself a restaurant that you will visit many times a year for one dish.I, frankly, have a love-hate relationship with Itacho. I find the Sashimi, other than fatty salmon, to be ok. I know a lot of you have high standards when it comes to sushi. . However, of all the \"lower end\" sushi establishments, this is best. When I mean lower end establishment, I mean getting your Wasabi from a plastic container that is used by everyone... \u00a0Not a fan, but hey, if its the sacrifice i have to make to get my hands on fatty salmon, i will. I give Itacho 4-stars, not because it has the best sashimi in the world, far from it. But because, it is the best among the lower -end Japanese sushi spots. Itacho is infinitely better than Ichiban Boshi. .",

Be warned for those who do not take wasabi, as the chain typically adds a small pinch of wasabi to their sushi, unless you specifically request to exclude it from your sushi.The only setback I find in returning to this outlet is that queuing for a seat can be a nightmare as the lines can grow to ridiculous lengths during peak hour. Go early before meal times or wait forever, especially at this outlet. Yes, it's that popular and with good reason.",
