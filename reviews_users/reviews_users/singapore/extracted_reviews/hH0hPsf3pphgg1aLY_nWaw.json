    "text": "Wow guys, no ice water? I mean sure you're next to a reservoir so people can go help themselves, but still!It's a lovely chill location, great for late night drinks while chilling with friends. The sliders were aiight, though a bit heavy on the BBQ sauce.The pork knuckle was appropriately crisp but surprisingly bland, and the accompanying sauerkraut was just bad. The signature lobster bisque was... flavourful but I don't remember much lobster.I enjoyed the homemade iced lemon tea though!Overall it's one of those places that's really more about the location than anything else.I'd go back because my friend lives across the street and they open pretty late, but would I travel there just because I miss Wawawa? That's a definite nah-uh-uh.",

When we approached the cashier regarding that, she literally told us off. Also, the waiters don't clean the tables as soon as the people leave. Lots of mosquitos. Please bring along your insect repellent!",

    "text": "A group of us had brunch here with a plan to have a relaxing meal then walk around the reservoir. After we ordered our meals and coffees, we were informed that the only water available was bottled mineral water. I can understand the restaurant wanting to discourage freeloaders from just sitting down and sipping tap water while enjoying the view. But it makes no sense forbidding legitimate diners from having water with their meals. As other reviewers have stated, the irony of this establishment next to a water reservoir cutting off tap water to their patrons is ..... beyond belief.Food came on instalments. Empty plates and cups were not cleared even when being served.Best part of this restaurant is its location and a reasonable selection of beers.",

Tea is hot water in a cup with a sachet - $6. A plate of 2 slices of ham and cheese sandwiches with some greens and eggs - $13. Edible.Nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either. Location is good, in a serene environment, if not interrupted by loud obnoxious music blaring from the speakers in the place. Staff kindly obliged to request of lowering the volume though.",

    "text": "Wawawa is a bistro located by the reservoir, with the intention of providing you with a cosy, chillax atmosphere by a body of water. However, I think the choice and selection of food and drinks is so-so only, nothing spectacular that you wouldn't find at any other bar. Also, you'd expect a bar in a place like Bedok Reservoir to have prices that would suit heartlanders, but you may actually be able to get cheaper beers by the pint in town.That being said, I think this is probably the only bar in the Bedok / Tampines area so if you want a social drinking spot this is the place to go.",

    "text": "If you are a vegetarian/vegan, then don't bother coming here, especially for brunch. My vegan husband wanted to order a green salad and hash browns, but was told that he could not order them separately and thus had to order a burger set; however, he is vegan, so the burger went to waste in order for him to get what he wanted. Not sure why the menu changed, as you used to be able to order a basket of hash browns as a side. Not many other menu items for vegetarians, and pretty much none for vegans on the brunch menu, though there was no other menu offered on the Saturday morning of our visit. We went with a group of people, all of whom have kids, but were told that the \"homemade\" pancakes were out, but we could have the waffles. This was confusing, as the batter for both is pretty similar, and if you can make \"homemade\" waffles, then why not pancakes? I ordered the french toast, which was cold when it arrived (ice cold in some parts) and tasted like it had been defrosted. It certainly did not taste like it had ever been hot off the stove top.On the lunch/dinner menu, the options for vegetarians are pretty slim. We live in a condo on Bedok Reservoir Road, and every month or so we go to Wawawa to give it another go, but every time we leave disappointed, whether from the slow service, the music, the too-few menu choices, or the cold food (which could very well be the result of the slow service, who knows?) The only thing that I can recommend is the chocolate lava cake on the dessert menu, which I'm pretty sure is the only reason why I would return in the future...after eating dinner somewhere else.",

    "text": "Wawawa is a cozy bistro restaurant situated at Bedok Reservoir. Nearby, you can spot part of the dismantled Berlin Wall, which was donated by an avid art lover. The restaurant draws its theme from the German reunification, bearing a key message of unity and freedom. The food on its menu is reasonably priced, with large influence from the German tradition of cooking. I cannot exactly recommend you what to eat, because everything that I've tried from here tasted really great. If you are really troubled, friendly staff are willing to assist and give you their recommendations. The restaurant is pretty open, and has a really nice atmosphere in the evening. Not too noisy, not too crowded, just a little hideout from the usual urban noise.",
