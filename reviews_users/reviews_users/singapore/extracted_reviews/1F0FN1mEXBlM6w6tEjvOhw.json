I order the Crab Meat with spaghetti! \u00a0I'm still raving about my dish. \u00a0The helping was huge with more than enough crab meat. \u00a0Every bite was better then the next bite. \u00a0I'm a pasta girl, I know good pasta. \u00a0I order a side order of onion rings. \u00a0I enjoyed the crisp on the outside. \u00a0Of course, my husband order the Avocado Salad with the Singapore Sling. \u00a0He was very pleased with his meal. \u00a0He cleaned his bowl too! \u00a0I can testify the Singapore Sling was good too.",

    "text": "Got here quarter to 7pm on a Friday. We were seated rudely by someone, who told us to sit anywhere. When we asked her for the wifi she barked she will give it to us. Super rude. Came and said kitchen is closing in 10 if you want food. No smile, nothing the whole time. Calamari was rock hard. Mee goreng had too much chilli sauce. There were ants all over the place and flies. Drinks are too weak...costs an extra $12 to make them into doubles. They also had no strawberry flavour for their frozen drinks so it ruled out half the drinks I wanted on the menu. Nice view and chill vibes. Food and drinks came fast too.",

    "text": "I don't know how you can mess up a salad, but apparently it's possible. The chicken was super greasy so the oil and dripping everywhere so that might as well be the dressing, and I've never seen tomatoes in a ceasar salad before. All the food was terrible and overpriced. My drink was pretty, but it wasn't good, but hey, it looks good to take a photo off. We only decided to eat here because you need to be a customer to use the lawn chairs and there were no where to sit on the beach. Wish we would have been to the other side to the beach first, there's plenty of other options to eat there and it's way prettier. There's a time limit for how much time you can relax on the lawn chair and there's a minimum of how much you need to spend on your ticket to sit.Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)",

(Rubbing my hands together watching people gulping those tasty cocktails-WAP~Down the hatch ever so quickly!) Now, let's get some tasty libations drinking myself silly!At Raffles, they had the audacity charging about \u00a0$25.00 U.S. Dollars for ONE Singapore Sling-I'm not spending THAT much money on a small drink so, for the same $25.00, I bought at least-if I remember correctly (I had quite a few drinks so, I totally zoned out unable remembering how many drinks I consumed-HAH!) BUT, it must have been at least-Uh~I think three, maybe it was five well-drinks? \u00a0Geez-My memory escapes me~HAH!Anyway, feeling higher than a kite flying in the clouds . . .I was floating into la-la-land, finally realizing I must ride the Metro returning to 98 SG . . . TOTALLY SOUSED! \u00a0Ooops! \u00a0You know, I don't remember how I returned to 98 SG . . . BUT, the next day, I woke up believe it or not . . . NO HANGOVER=20-Million STARS to the awesome bartender who made my well-drinks!!! \u00a0**\\(^ ___ ^)/**~Weeeeeee-----Cheers!",

    "text": "After a long day in the sun at Sentosa, we ended up at this bar close to the southernmost point in Continental Asia. It should have been a more enjoyable experience than it was but unfortunately we will be unlikely to return. We ordered some beer and some cocktails to sit back and watch the sunset. The bar was not very busy. Most of the beers on the menu were not available at that time. The cocktails were OK but pricy. The pool table was $10 to play for 1 hour although there was only blackboard chalk for the cues. Our last game on the pool table went over the hour. Despite the fact that there was no one else waiting to play the staff wasted no time in letting us know that the game had to finish. Then they repeated this a couple of minutes later. Yes, I know it was $10 for one hour, but was it really good customer service to kick your customers off the table when there was no one else waiting to play. We only wanted to finish the game that we started. Keep your stock of drinks in line with the menu, learn to improve the level of customer service and you have the makings of a great bar in a great location.",
