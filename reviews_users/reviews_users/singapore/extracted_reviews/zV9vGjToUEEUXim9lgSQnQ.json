I really don't appreciate coffee much, but my javaholic friends gave this place the thumbs up - and so I pass on their recommendation.it's a lovely space, manned by lovely people - service is a tad slow on account of their crowdedness, but it's sincere, and the food is both reasonably-priced and tasty. a shiner in its class.",

They had some interesting beans from Mecca Espresso in Sydney available on filter which I didn't have a chance to try. Maybe that would be better.The big brekkie was better, although not mind-blowing. Eggs were well-scrambled, bread was good quality but could've done with some toasting, sausage was rather tasteless and baked beans were smothered in so much tomato sauce that few actual legumes could be found in the mushy mix.Given the increasing competitiveness among new cafe openings in Singapore, I see little reason to return.And by the way, the downstairs seating is all stools with no back support. They lose a point for this from me. But there is free wifi.",

    "text": "5 stars for the coffee, 3 stars for the food. The coffee here is exceptional. I tried the raspberry candy coffee, which surprisingly had the flavor of raspberry. I've never had anything quite like it.The baked egg was their supposed \"signature\" and was pretty tasty, but not something I'd go out of my way for. It came with salmon and raw kale. If they had baked or fried the kale, that might have tied everything together.Love that they provide the wifi password right at the cash register. That's what a good internet cafe should be like. The ambience was quite adorable with a cozy, cottage-like feel. Since you order first, it's easy to split the bill with a big group. Prices were also quite reasonable, so no need to break the bank for brunch. If you arrive before noon, there'll be plenty of seats on the two floors.",

Mind you, it was one of those places that I was specifically looking for, namely because the name sounded pretty cool and I was expecting a London coffee shop experience. Well, a part of me felt that they tried, but it really didn't work all that well. The other thing was that it was pretty difficult to find the sugar, and the upstairs area was pretty ordinary as well. In the end, its not really a place I'd be hurrying back to any time soon.",

Second visit: Monday morning at around 9am. Ordered one of the breakfast sets, toast with avocado and coffee. This was incredibly disappointing. The toast, while good quality, was tiny. And the worst bit, the portion of avocado was unacceptably small. Not even 1/8 of an avocado was provided - just three and a half (barely) Super thin tiny slivers of avo which I had to strategically spread out in order to get some in each bite. After eating I felt like I hadn't even had breakfast. Really a shame they scrimp on this and ruin an otherwise great potential breakfast option. Would have been 5 stars but after my breakfast I cannot rate this cafe so highly.",

    "text": "My family and I came to this modern little cafe after reading on Ho Ching's list of 15 must eats in Singapore that the salted egg prawn eggs benedict at Drury Lane was to die for. We looked forward to this weekend brunch all week, and sadly, were quite disappointed.THE DRINKSI had an iced white, which was very cute and tasted nice. Had a good amount of caffeine, but not too much.THE FOOD - fusion-esque, but missing the synergy to make it workWe were excited to try some awesome-sounding fusion dishes, but none of them hit the mark. Fusion is hard - it sounds exciting, but often the mix of different cultures, tastes, and techniques makes the food lose the appealing factors from its constituent bases. I think that's what happened here. We tried the chili crab pasta with kale, topped with a poached egg. This was ok - the chili crab was a little sweet with the spaghetti. Spaghetti texture was nice, not too mushy. We also had the kale salad with red onions, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and quinoa, with a lemon vinaigrette. This was probably our favorite dish of the ones we tried, as it was the least fusion-y and most basic. The flavors were good and the ingredients were fresh enough. Finally, the infamous salted egg prawns eggs benedict served on a Chinese bao. This just was trying too hard. The bao didnt have the crunch that a traditional english muffin does, and therefore lacked texture to compliment the poached egg. The prawn and salted egg tastes were good, but got lost amongst the large bao and the poached egg. Overall, it was a pricy and unimpressive meal.THE WIFISpotty at best.",

    "text": "Nothing Dreary 'bout Drury Lane Located across the road from Singapore's famous wedding street, Drury Lane is a cozy little cafe offering a range of classic dishes along with some innovative creations. I've heard of this place for months but was never able to get myself free to try it.... Until now.I've read the mixed reviews for this place but still decided to give it a chance. Innocent until proven guilty right? It was a really scorching day so for one, we were just happy that the air-conditioning was working very well. \u00a0I've been to a few of the wedding shops across the street (as a best-men and not as a groom) and I know how temperamental some of these old converted buildings can get, trapping heat in the strangest of places. Not too much of a smell going on as there was barely anyone when we came. Staff were nice and friendly, offering a menu the second we stepped in. Only thing was, I wished she stood in front of the counter instead of behind it. More pleasant to the eye and easier for her too, not requiring to stretch across the counter to provide me a menu. Decided not to go into the many details of their coffee today but concentrate more on the food. Steak SandwichOne word. Awesome! Beef was done medium rare and was really juicy and tender, cheese was strong enough to add to the saltiness of the dish while the onions (and I don't normally like raw onions) added a greater depth to the dish, giving it a bit of pungentness and cutting the richness making it more even and enjoyable. And at $8.00, it was worth every cent! Although I would have loved the option of a fried egg. What's better than eggs and streak right? Salted Egg Yolk Eggs BenedictNow this was a pleasant surprise. Sitting on top of steamed buns (like those used it stewed pork buns or kong ba bao), and layered with vege, prawns, poached eggs and finally, a salted egg yolk sauce, this dish was true east meets west. The prawns were well seasoned and not over cooked, the eggs were perfectly runny and the salted egg added such a nice dimension to the dish that we were hoping we could have asked for more sauce! A wonderful take on an otherwise overdone and over promoted Eggs Benedict. Mandarin orange and pineapple cake And what better way to end the meal (we actually started the meal with this instead, but let's pretend we ended with it since it's a dessert) than with a generous slice of mandarin orange and pineapple cake. At a glance, it looked like a regular carrot cake with cream cheese topping but one bite would bring all the festivities and firecrackers of Chinese New Year bursting in your mouth! The mandarin orange is the star of the cake, with the slight acidity coming through. The pineapple (which was more of a pineapple tart paste than the fruit) adds a good amount of sweetness and tartness to the cake, elevating the flavours of the mandarin. A harmonious blend to welcome in the new year! Iced Chocolate. Now THIS is what a chocolate milk / ice chocolate should taste like. Unlike the bottled one from my previous post, this was a pretty good ice chocolate (my favourite still goes to the frozen chocolate drink from the now closed au Chocolat at Marina Bay Sands).Bottom line? Drury Lane knows what they're doing and on my next trip, I'll try their much raved coffees and Beef Ribs which I heard were amazing. Now to close my eyes and imagine that succulent steak sandwich.",

First of all, it's located in an old shophouse which generally is fun cos it adds to the ambience. However, methinks they never changed the electrical wirings because the first time I went, power tripped SIX times during my meal. In fact, the dishes were so underwhelming I thought I would never return. I only went back as a friend wanted to try. This time, I had a salted egg prawn eggs Benedict. Uneven dish. Prawns? YUMS. Poached eggs' yolks were sufficiently runny. But serving it on a slice of white bread?? Come on! And the salted egg could be saltier. My friends ordered a Big Breakfast. Honestly, the presentation was terrible. See photo attached. I think it was sufficiently yummy cos my friends finished it?Our dessert - turkey bacon pancakes - was the best. Pancakes were sufficiently fluffy yet slightly dense. Turkey bacon was nothing to scream about. And I think I enjoyed it simply because there was maple syrup. Its cheaper price point means they attract Uni students. Honestly, if you can afford a more expensive meal, please go there. Overall, I don't hate this place. I just think...it is very blah. Servers aren't too friendly and importantly, the food is very uneven in terms of taste and quality. So. There are better cafes in the vicinity. Try Souper Sarnies.",

I came to Drury Lane after reading a well-known blogger that listed it as one of the best brunch places in Singapore. To say that I was disappointed was an understatement. First the environment and ambience. Others have commented on the ground floor being stuffy. Upstairs was equally bad. There was no air conditioner, just a few fans and on a hot day like today, it was almost suffocating. I also found the place very dirty. While some have described this place as \"chilled\" and \"laid back\", I'd say it lacks any soul. I ordered an iced white and an salted egg shrimp eggs benedict. The coffee was good but I'm not sure how some could describe the eggs benedict as \"to die for\"! I could barely taste the salted egg. The shrimp still had shells on their tails but you wouldn't know since they were smothered in the super bland salted egg \"sauce\". The whole dish was horrible. Some have commented on bad service. I actually didn't found the service ok. The only comment is I could barely hear the lady who took my order who seemed like she was whispering to a mouse.",

I was told this place has a British vibe...not sure what that means since I've never been to the Motherland. The store is rather deep and there's also seating upstairs on the 2nd floor.Food wise, Drury Lane specializes in baked eggs: tomatoes and beans baked with an egg on top. Then, topped with salmon, chicken, or whatever else is preferred. I thought the baked egg was meh...too bland for my liking and needed lots of salt and pepper.Service was excellent! A large party came before my small party of three, and to thank us for waiting 20 additional minutes, they gave us a carrot cake on the house! I'm not a fan of carrot cakes, but this one came with earl gray frosting!!! Def. worth the wait! Walnuts were also baked into the batter...Yum!I'll be back for the decor and earl gray frosting with carrot cake!",

    "text": "Just a couple of days old and yet already geared with great vibes/coffee/food. Their coffee beans are from Toby's Estate but with a special customized blend and a few single origin for the brew bar. I had a brew coffee which was slightly too dark for my liking but had a quiet toffee finish. The current blend is no 94 which has a strawberry finish. Only had a chance to grab a banana bread to go and was greeted with a sweet surprise of espresso butter. There is a wide range of muffins/sandwiches. The space is unique and chill. I like the extra space upstairs! Plus, there is free wifi, so I can definitely see a crowd coming here to work/study. The location is very convenient. A five minute walk (or less) from the MRT. Owners are very friendly and passionate about coffee & food. Add this place to your list pronto! More next time.",

I kid you not!!Poached eggs, banana bread, baked beans... you name it, it's being zapped and you are eating nutrition-less plastic food filled with radiation.I am amazed that in this day in age kitchens are still being equipped with microwave. Have we not learnt anything over the past 40 years?You will never see me venture into Drury Lane again - ever.",

    "text": "Do not be deceived by the crowded 1st level, i was deterred once but decided head on back to check them out. The cafe spans 2 storeys so head on upstairs to escape the oily food smells as cooking and brewing are all done in that little space. Oh but do note that you gotta come down to place your orders still. It was a terribly hot day and we headed up to level 2 as W had already gotten us a reservation. I was hoping for a cool reprieve from the crazy heat but there was none. The AC was super weak and hardly cooled the heated 2nd storey of the shophouse. It was obvious that they have issues with the power rating as well because we had 2 blackouts in the short span of an hour.Well brunch was meant to be a birthday gathering for Cliff and i felt so bad for suggesting Drury at that point. It was also impossible to hear each other because the acoustics were terrible. Throw in 20 other people and it's just deafening. Not a good place for a date certainly.So i had the Iced Mocha because it was simply too hot to have a hot drink. The drink was pretty good imo with melted chocolate instead of bottled syrup and it didn't overpower the mellow coffee. We had one of the specials which is the Garlic toast with sausage patties, sauteed mushrooms, spinach and truffle scrambled eggs ($18). This was the best savory dish out of the lot due to the garlic spread i guess. Scrambled eggs were too runny in my opinion and that sausage patty was just a joke with its bland flavor and dry nature. Eeks. For $18, it's not quite worth it. I've just had the pulled duck with apricot croissant at Symmetry and it was way better than this at the same price.The sandwiches are at least decently priced at about $8 ish. The Steak and Cheese Sandwich was supposed to be awesome but they didn't have that when we visited. The Smoked Salmon and Mushroom alternative were just alright.DO NOT EAT the Sausage Baked Eggs ($12) with spinach, homemade baked beans and cheese. We saw that familiar cardboardish sausage patty. Well this pot of food is terribly bland and pedestrian. I'm sure i make better stuff than this. I thought the baked beans were more canned than homemade though. \u00a0Maybe try the Cloud 9.4 which is bacon infused pancakes with honey if you please.Well, would i go back to Drury Lane? Not for the food certainly. But the desserts were quite divine. Not to sure about the 'Pay as you wish' muffins but the Banana Bread with Espresso Butter ($2.50) had W and i takeaway a portion each.The moist bread with chunks of banana was naturally sweetened and i'm glad they didn't add more sugar. The espresso butter wasn't that good because it was oily (not the good kinda butter way) and lacked espresso flavor.The Carrot cake was also one of the best i've had as well. It's of medium density but very well flavored with spice. We liked that there wasn't too much cream cheese because they didn't ice the sides but those between the layers were just sufficient for the added flavors and moisture.Verdict of Drury Lane- I may drop by again for the sweets and a quick drink but certainly not for the food.",

This is going to be damn good!) was quickly squashed not by the delicious smell of freshly pulled espresso, but by a rather shocking pungent smell that engulfed the entire downstairs area. I have no doubt whatever they were cooking up was delicious, but I wasn't ready to smack head first into an olfactory brick wall when all I really wanted was a long black and a place to relax for a bit.Once I found the back staircase leading to an upstairs seating section (and that there was a fast, free internet connection showing up on my list) I was set. And the coffee was delicious.",

    "text": "i love this place!named after the famed street in london, it's cute, small, charming cafe located in the pretty hipster tanjong pagar area. been there 4 times, so far, and have never been disappointed. i quite like the upstairs, which has a cool courtyard and a really nice vibe. it also has a long communal table which can accommodate bigger groups of up to say, 8 people. they take reservations, which can be a boon if you don't want to spend your weekends waiting endless for a table at your favorite no-reservation brunch spot. the coffee was decent ($4.50 for a long black), but the bunch didn't really blow me away. they do their own homemade baked beans, which their pair with most their egg dishes ($10-$14), but i found it way too sweet and wish they'd gone with some good old-fashioned heinz. i'd recommend sticking to the sandwiches, which were good and noticeably cheaper ($8). \u00a0 \u00a0the real winner, for me, were the desserts. the chocolate tart ($4) was delicious and so were the \"pay as you wish\" muffins. yes, free muffins! though, i think most of us would be obliged to give something (...or not). anyway, tried the peanut butter one, which was divine. overall, if you're looking for a chill place for coffee/desserts and don't have high expectations for mains, definitely check it out.",
