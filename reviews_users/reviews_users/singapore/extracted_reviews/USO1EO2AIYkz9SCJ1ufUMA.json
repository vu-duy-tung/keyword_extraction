The satay was as good as grilled meat can be..which of course is amazing. Multiple stalls to choose from. My impression which could be wrong is that I was getting some street food without the street food risk because it was at the back of gardens by the bay. It was a mix of locals and tourists which also seems like a positive sign. The people were very friendly and the whole area was very clean overall. If you're at gardens of the bat and don't require 5 star ambiance you have to go eat some meat on a stick, at the very least.",

Get satay from both!On the Malay side, Satay Power is very good. They have a very thick style peanut sauce, tasty and quite power. Chicken wings are super yummy! And best of all, good service and very nice staff. On the Chinese side, you can get... pork belly satay! City Satay did the job though I wasn't a fan of their weaker and more watery peanut sauce.",

There are signs on the other empty stalls on opening dates.The chicken wings were great. Crispy skin, nicely seasoned. The satays were a little too sweet for my liking, the BBQ stingray were so-so. Pricing were a little high (wings go for $1.40 each), guess that is partly for the location.It is located right between Gardens by the Bay and the barrage. They actually have their own car park that gets you right to the doorsteps. But we realized later that the barrage is just a nice walk away along the reservoir, and free parking!",

We also had chili crab, soups and young coconut juice. All that food, stuffed to the gils, for about 50 SG$ for 3 hungry ladies. The next time I'm in Singapore, I'll go back for sure :)",

The standards are...(wait there are none), sadly to say I'm getting frustrated just writing this post and thinking about the place. My family and I decided to go because there was some write up about it on the ST today, and to think that Tony Bourdain wants to bring this concept to Manhattan? Sure, just as long as its not a replica of it. The one thing I can never get with Singapore and its developments are that they are always half-assing things. If you've been there and seen the sad satay stalls perched on the exterior i think you know what I'm talking about. They are not even created as permanent stalls, but makeshifts, as if there was some food show and they just came to set up. This is your namesake for crying out loud! It's a shame... a total shame. Not to mention that only a handful of stalls were open and the options were bbq seafood, bbq seafood, 5 satay stalls, one turkish place and steamboat. Food was...let's just say I would have been a lot happier grabbing a mickey d's takeout. We ordered a chicken kebab, (bland) bread was good though, hommous was one-note, baba ghanoush went sour. We tried the bbq seafood (next to the popiah stall) everything tasted the same...and sadly they cook just to cook, no thought in to it, just as long as it was edible. I don't know what to say GBTB, clean up your act a little, you spent so much money on your gardens and you place this eye-sore in the corner...of which your little wooden plank signage was horrible at directing us. Will I ever come back? I think the answer is clear. That is unless they bring in better stalls, and spiff up the place.",

Surprisingly, there was one stall open at around 10am when we arrived and therefore that was the one we got to try. Despite the excellent location and views, the satay was of modest quality and a bit pricey. It may have been nicer to be able to try a lot of different satay varieties. However, I still wouldn't expect the highest quality or most affordable food from this location.",

The place is much livelier at night as during the day it was pretty empty and hard to flag down the people who run each of the stalls.At night there is a man and woman yelling \"satay satay satay\" for the satay stall and I ended up getting the satay from there. Be aware that there is quite a wait for them to actually finish making the satay, as they grill it as you order it, so if you're in a rush I wouldn't recommend this place.The satay itself ended up being just average. I've had much better satay elsewhere, and the sauce was just so-so. It tastes like if you just ordered satay from a restaurant that specializes in something else, where the main focus isn't the satay. Still the dish was cooked fresh and I guess I can't complain.I also had the hokkien mee (noodles and shrimp) from another stall, and that was pretty bad I wouldn't recommend that.Overall a good selection of food, but none of it looked or tasted that great.",

But, it also sells other items such like seafood and drinks. Please bring mosquito repellent here, or you will certainly be eaten alive. Thank goodness we were prepared. Anyway, back to the satay. Here, there are two main satay food stalls competing for customers. Of course we tried both stalls to see which one we liked. Now, we didn't get the names of these stalls. But, we know for certain that we enjoyed the satay stall further away from the dining tables. We tried both beef and mutton satays. However, we enjoyed the mutton satays best. They were more flavorful and aromatic than the beef satays. Also, the peanut sauce from the further away satay stall tasted better too. We were pretty hungry, and we ate God only knows how many satay sticks. It was really hard to stop. Lol. \u00a0Come here and check them out. Sample both satay food stalls and see which one you prefer. Enjoy!",

Damn it was all good. Service was a little slow as it was a busy night. I recommend first timers to ask the servers how to eat some of the dishes if you are not sure.After dinner we moved to the desert stall where everyone picked their own desert. I had an iced jelly with lunch longan and canned fruit. It was good but a little too sweet.When dinner lasts 3 hours, you know it was a good time had by all.",

It has more than just satay, there's crabs, lobsters, chicken, rice, pot food, Turkish food and pretty much anything. The satay is nutty and spicy, and the chicken is slightly tough, but delicious, and the chips from the Mariana Bar were crunchy and tasty. Service is a bit slow, but it's a good place to eat if you're willing to wait.",

    "text": "Not the most authentic of hawker centers in Singapore, Satay by the Bay aims to give those visiting Gardens by the Bay a taste of the traditional fare in a slightly more elegant outdoor setting.It's clean, of course, with the standard hygiene ratings prominently displayed in each stall. And there's variety, from Indian to Malay to Turkish to Chinese to Singapore satay. The six of us ordered a handful of dishes from different stalls to share: roti prata and mee goreng; chicken, lamb and beef satay with spicy peanut sauce and cucumbers (it's a must); fried rice and sweet barbecued baby squid (this one was interesting. They were as crispy as freshly minted potato chips); chicken wings and black pepper beef; and honeydew and watermelon juice from the drinks stall.The flavors were all there and it was a great introduction to the variety of tastes that Singapore has to offer for my friend, a first-time visitor, but I probably wouldn't go back. I've had better dishes elsewhere in the city (even at touristy places such as Lau Pa Sat). That said, the seafood mee goreng, a long-time favorite of mine, was delicious.The bathrooms are outdoors and clean, too. Perfect for washing the satay sauce off your hands before taking a stroll about the marina.",

Chili Crab - It was messy, and spicy. \u00a0Take your time and eat with rice.Fish head stew- It does not sound so good but there is a lot of meat surrounding the head.Fried fish cakes - pick out the stuff you want then they deep fried them upon ordering.Popiah spring roll - super thin crepe wrapped crunchy vegetables like carrots, peanuts, jicama, turnip, bean curd. \u00a0The bomb if you like veggies.Chicken wings - juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside, it was good but not mind blowing.Satay sticks - honestly, the different meats all tasted about the same to me since they have the same sauce.Cane juice and coconut juice- fresh from the source, happy face!They have open sink with soap for people to wash hand.",

    "text": "Smokey Goodness by the Bay Satay by the Bay, one of our favorite places to dine in Singapore. Not just a modern food court, Satay by the Bay brings back some of the old charm of the old Satay Club. Maybe it's the outdoor setting with its wooden stools and low tables or Maybe it's the hint of salt water coming from the reservoir. Which ever it is, it's certainly made Satay by the Bay one of our favourite food joints. While we've yet to try everything here, there are some notable stalls we would and wouldn't recommend. Sri Geylang SateDefinitely our favourite stall of the 6 (or 8?) stalls available here. I suppose Satay is quite selective. We love this store because the meats are well marinated and very fragrant. The chicken is is juicy, mutton too. Beef, a little of the dry side but still very very tasty. City Satay is probably the most popular of the Chinese owned satay stalls. Maybe it's the variety or the fact that they're a well know brand but personally, I feel that he sauce is a little synthetic and factory made. Boon Tat Barbecue SeafoodDefinitely our favourite Tze Char stall here. They have a good variety of dishes but we personally enjoy the BBQ stingray here. Unlike other BBQ stingrays, the chilli used here is more dry Belachan than it is Sambal. It's salty, flavorful and goes very well with the stingray. Another favourite is their Special Fried Chicken wings. Refusing to say what the marinade or batter really is, there is a hint of fermented prawn past. The chicken is nice and crispy and very juicy (except for our last visit where it was a little over cooked). Maybe they aren't used to the crowds thanks to Gardens by the Bay's Christmas Carnival. Another notable mention is Wholly Crab. Opened by local celebrity Felicia Chin, the crab in a bag looks absolutely delightful. Though we haven't tried it personally, the number of people happily digging in and licking their fingers is enough to get my attention and we're going to try it next time! Overall, we love this place. Is it touristy? A little but there's enough good food here to keep the locals coming back. Some items may be on the slightly pricier side as compared to our regular food court or food centre stalls but, it's still worth the walk and definitely worth the price. Satay Party anyone?",
