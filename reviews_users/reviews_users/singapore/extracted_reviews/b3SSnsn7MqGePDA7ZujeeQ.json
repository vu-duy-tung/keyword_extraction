    "text": "I am surprised that there are so many Din Tai Fung restaurants here in Singapore, 19! This boggles my mind because of the size of SG and that back home in the whole state we only have a few! That being said, it's neat to compare home to this recent visit to see if it is similar since they have so many branches. It is quite similar even in pricing as well. You can see them making and folding the dumplings and the classic pork Xiao Long Bao comes out fresh steaming onto the table. The ginger and vinegar with the flavor and soup of the dumpling is so comforting and tasty. S$10.30 for 10. Overall, it's similar to the other DTFs I have been so I appreciate the quality and consistency even across the world. I thought the tops were a little thick on a few of the dumplings but it is okay. Free flow hot jasmine tea for $1 that they charge without telling you was unexpected but it complimented the meal so I enjoyed it. You do have to ask for refills though because once you receive all of your order, the service is directed to another table and not really to you. Of all the things to eat, I always go for the classic but the veggies, noodles, and other dumplings are also good. Tip: Arrive early and you likely won't have to wait :) Tip 2: There are partnerships with banks like Citibank that have certain specials. For example, certain baos were at a discounted price and rice dumplings too when I recently went.",

    "text": "They're everywhere but perhaps Din Tai Fung's popularity is for good reason. It's clean-tasting Chinese food well executed. Love the fact that in every branch, you can look into the kitchen and see them making all those many dumplings. I really enjoyed the shrimp and pork dumplings with the tasty broth. Didn't care for the pork and veggie dumplings because it was borderline dry. Give that a miss. Also had a couple of appetizers. Big fan of the braised beef. Despite being pretty lean, it's still tasty with the light sauce. Would be even more perfect if they had some mustard to go with it. Other snacks we had included the cucumber salad, century eggs, and braised bean curd - all really decent but not necessarily memorable. This branch at Nex is surprisingly big but is run like a tight ship. Service is friendly and efficient. Got here right at 11am when they opened and were seated promptly but the line was out the door by the time noon rolled around.",

Second best is Crystal Jade's. 2. Dan dan main- Love the peanut sauce on the noodles- These are handmade, stretchy white chinese noodles- A plain and simple dish. Overall, I think I can confidentially vouch for all dumplings and noodles dishes from this place. Service is very efficient too for the amount of traffic they get.

My first experience with Din Tai Fung was at the Paragon location, and I loved it. I've been to this location, at NEX, several times since because it is more convenient. Unfortunately, it never lives up to my first experience. Bottom line: \u00a0Din Tai Fung is great, but go to the one at Paragon. And if you are there in July or August I highly recommend the seasonal chili crab dumplings.",
