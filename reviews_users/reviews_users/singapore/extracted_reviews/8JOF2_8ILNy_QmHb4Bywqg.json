Very authentic Indian.Also, try their crab kebabs, prawn curry and Laccha parantha is a good off the menu item that you can order to go with their seafood masala and curry dishes.Overall a pleasant and enjoyable experience.",

Originally i was hesitant since, while i love indian food, its usually not the best option for lunch as its usually heavy and makes me sleepy.Well scratch all of that. This place is awesome! It's not cheap by any means, but all of us were in awe by how tasty and flavorful everything is.I got the fish set lunch and i ate up everything that was on the plate. All of them delicious. My friend also ordered Paneer Tikka and some sort of vegetarian dish with deep fried lady fingers. Both were fine choices.Bottom line - do try this place. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Great food, odd service. I came in on a recommendation from a knowledgeable source. \u00a0Once I sat down and finally gotten the attention of a waiter, I ordered Tandoori Prawns for an appetizer, Green Chili Crab, Stuffed Pomfret, Naan, and plain rice for the main.The food then proceeded to trickle out of the kitchen, one slooooow dish at a time. \u00a0And the first thing out of the kitchen was the stuffed pomfret - basically a fish stuffed with awesome curry and then pan fried to a crispy excellence. \u00a0The waiter didn't just put the fish down on the table as I would have preferred - he began cutting it into portions and serving us. \u00a0I thought that was weird, but whatever. \u00a0The fish was bonier than Keith Richards. \u00a0But the flavor was awesome, and the stuffing was good.Then a few minutes of a waiting period occurred before the appetizer came out. Tandoori prawns at Gajalee are so good, just blasting with flavor. I ate them quickly then resumed the waiting period for the next dish. This wait period was a bit longer than the last, during which the waiter put a plastic bib on me. Then he brought out the green chili crab. This was the best crab I've ever eaten, and the whole reason for the 4 star rating. The rice and naan came out shortly after the crab. Each dish was spooned out by the server onto my plate.I would've preferred all the food to come out at once - and just put it on the table, I can handle it from there. \u00a0Overall great tasting food. I would go back for the green chili crab.",

I was delighted to find out they had opened in Singapore!You're not going to get better Indian coastal cuisine elsewhere in Singapore. Gajalee serves up awesome coastal cuisine, loosely defined as: Konkani, Malvani, Goan cuisines in and around the state of Maharashtra. What this means is.. try the stuffed pomfret, tandoori prawns, green chilly crab, bombay duck fry (bombay duck actually being a fish).It is, as my Mumbai friends and I would say, o-w-ee-sommeee.",
