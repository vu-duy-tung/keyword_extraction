    "text": "Their service is just impeccable. I ordered through Food Panda and they called me up to say that the briyani rice was slightly overcooked and that they didn't want to serve it to their customers, offering the cumin rice instead. The entire phone call, he was terribly apologetic and kind. Such a joy to support their business!Fish Tikka Masala - 5 starsTender on the inside with a perfectly grilled crust. This beats any sort of chicken tikka masala hands down (I don't eat chicken, and the ones I've eaten in the past have always been dry).Fish Briyani Rice Set ($11.77 on FoodPanda) - 3 starsThe one dish I'm not impressed by. It comes with only 3 small pieces of fish - fish that's breaded similar to the orange-colored frozen fish filet in a McDonald's burger and some shredded cabbage, carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes. The fish was cooked well - it was tender and not overcooked. But I'd still order rice and dishes like the fish tikka masala separately the next time. Usually rice and 2-3 dishes (spinach, fish, palak paneer) can easily last me 4-5 meals.Spinach ($7.49) - 4.5 starsA bit on the soggy side this time. But there's always ample cooked spinach!",

Ended up taking what felt like more than half an hour to arrive, by which time our chicken tikka was completely cold. Dosa was ok, but the gravy / Dhal was pretty stingy. If you're in this area, much better off going to Karu's on top of Sime Darby Centre.",

The chicken was really juicy but the sauce wasn't as creamy as I'd like. Friendly service and very cold water though!",

All the regulars like butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, naan breads are well executed. Service is pleasant too.Would skip the more expensive sixth avenue options to come to this place. Parking is easier too.",

    "text": "they used to be along the road facing the second hand car shops.they also used to be non air conditioned.now they are in a spanking new location opposite omakase burger within the retail complex itself.now they are air conditioned with the option for alfresco dining if you so choose.they open at 10.30am just as we arrived.only vegetarian choices available until around 12pm.and that's when we managed to get our hands on their yummy yogurt tender chicken tikka with a tinge of spiciness.before 12pm, you just have to settle for their stir fried cabbage with spices and dried chillies.very sedap!mixed vegetables consisting of cauliflower, chick peas, potatoes, carrots and long beans was a little stodgy.chick pea curry was creamy good.kosong bawang is my favourite prata.plain prata with plentiful sweet onions!their masala thosai was crispy outside with soft potato filling inside.a healthier option when compared to the prata.finish off with their teh halia, not too sweet and not too gingery.",

    "text": "I like Curry Gardenn for it's reasonably priced (average $5 per dish) and delicious North Indian dishes. While it's not as good as some other North Indian restaurants in Singapore, I would still recommend Curry Gardenn because it's really good value for money and it just has a really good vibe. The owner's are nice and friendly and the service is efficient. I've tried the Palak Paneer, Butter Chicken, Mango Lassi and Garlic Naan and enjoyed all of it.Curry Gardenn is also situated in an interesting location. It's really quiet at night, parking is abundant and free. However, I've heard that Turf City has been bought over and is due to be renovated so I'm not sure what will happen to Curry Gardenn. Better go quick!",

We decided to wait around and luckily managed to get a seat not too long after we arrived.We had to wait quite a long while for our food to be served, but I guess that is to be expected given the crowds around here. Anyway, we had the following dishes such as the curry fish head, chicken masala, all kinds of naan and rice. The curry here is absolutely amazing! The curry ws just rich enough and not overpowering, the degree of spiciness was also just right for me.Overall, this is definitely a great place to eat some good Indian food.",
