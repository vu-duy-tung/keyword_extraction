    "text": "Four Koreans brought me here. It was very authentic. We had to wait for 45 minutes to get a table.They had a lot of our favorite foods. The mixed pancake appetizer was very impressive. Many different types of snacks and they were all excellent and remind me of the same things in Seoul. The mushroom bulgogi was a high point, although you need to make sure you stir it before the meat gets cooked and sticks together. The Makgolli and plum wine were great.Some people also like the interior because it has a Korean motif, but I think the food is really the reason to go here.",

The side dishes were meh and a bit disappointing, but the main dishes we tried were not bad. The agujjim and the kimchi stew we ordered were very generous in portion and filling for our party of 3. Probably not a good place for a big group as seating is limited. I recommend you make reservations ahead.",

    "text": "I was craving for bibimbap and chance upon this place.Came here with my church buddies and we decided to go for Tteokbokki even though we wanted to try a number of dishes. The Tteokbokki wasn't what I expected - I was thinking of Korean Rice Cakes served in a plate with spicy sauce, fish cakes and some spring onions on top. It was actually in Budae Jjigae (Army Based Stew) style. There were a number of ingredients inside and you have to wait for it to cook on a portable gas stove.Price wise, if there is three or more sharing this dish, it was pretty reasonable. The portion was right for the three of us. The interior was pretty spacious too. Service wise was excellent. Upon stepping inside the restaurant, the waiters/waitresses greeted us and guided us to our seatings. While leaving the restaurant, you could grab some Korean candies along the way too. Overall, it was pretty good and my friends and I enjoyed our time there. :)",

    "text": "LOVE THE FOOD. Okay so there are lotsa Korean places in SG, but my gawd this was the best bin bim bap EVERRRRRR. First off, it surprised me like crazy cuz it came in a large steel bowl, and the rice...i really dont know how to describe it, but its some goddamn amazball rice. The dish also came with lotsa other lil veggies that don't come with regular binbimbaps. loved it so much. it was also a huge portion for SGD20 and i was holding my tummy out the door. my friends got some meat stuff, but i really didn't pay attention as the binbimbap was just too amazing. i still can't get over that rice. when i mixed up all of my veggies with the rice (this is a regular practice for binbimbaps) - the rice sorta clumped up into little balls....IT WAS JUST SO GOOD.In addition, we got lotsa lil free side dishes that came along. while most korean places offer the lil dishes for free, i never take them for granted, given how some places in SG still charge for WATER!!!!! damnation! anyway - go and try this place. it also happens to be in a great neighborhood with lotsa other bars/restaurants. please try the binbimbap - you won't regret it.",

    "text": "We popped into Todamgol for lunch on a rainy day, and I'm glad we did. It's a but of a crapshoot picking a Korean restaurant on Tanjong Pagar because there are so many of them there, and it's possible that some of the others are even better, but I was pretty happy with Todamgol. We had the lunch set, which just a ridiculous amount of food, and tons of variety. There must have been at least 10 different dishes, not counting the kimchi and other banchan, and all of them were good. We also got an extra side of kimchi pajeon, which was another winner. I wish I could describe the dishes in more detail, but I was in such a massive food coma afterwards that it's all a little hazy now. I'm going back soon, so will try to write an update then.",

The large vegetable and spam chigae's spicy soup stock is probably one of the best in Singapore. \u00a0Taste the best after all the ingredients have simmered. \u00a0Would definitely go back again.",
