Dude makes a hell of a cocktail and was so kind to share some local favorites. He wrote down a list a places for us to try. Made your boy feel right at home. For sure coming back here just to have a drink and hang. I ordered an off menu margarita and it was delicious \u00a0Definitely try the pork belly hash waffle. Yes, that's what I said..pork belly waffle. Great view of the bay if you walk outside.",

Dining alone, I chose a table outside and ordered a sweet tea, chicken & waffles and for dessert the peach cobbler. Chicken was excellent. Super moist and huge portions. I didn't know how to feel about the side of watermelon, felt very antebellum to me but it worked with the overall meal. The sweet tea was not real southern sweet tea. I lived in Atlanta, GA... to know sweet tea. The dessert was ok, presentation was beautiful but the peach to crust to ice cream ratio was off. Not enough of it! What took this over the top for me was the location of the restaurant! It was right in front of the MBS light show! I'd go back to get something else and to look at the light show. Overall a solid 4.5 stars!",

Now this is no regular mall... there was no Sears or JC Penny as anchor stores, \u00a0this was a bit more upscale. I went here for lunch with a coworker and it was comfort food at its best wrapped in a great atmosphere. It was a little bit of the South transplanted in Singapore. The decor was cool and hip with whiskey bottle lampshades and pictures of blues, rock, and jazz players along with elvis that flashed on the wall. There was a great selection of craft beers and from the looks of it the cocktails were crafted with care.I had the wings with fried okra and it was delicious. I just had to add the a side of mac and cheese. It was all so good, I had to thank the chef on my way out!",

    "text": "Definitely not your granny's Southern cookin'; high-end with high prices to match!This restaurant is by the same people that operate Yardbird in South Beach Miami. (Miami? That's a little too far South) The menu had almost all the Southern favorites I used to eat regularly when I lived in Atlanta. Fried chicken, collard greens, biscuits, cornbread, shrimp n grits, fried green tomatoes. \u00a0The chicken and waffles were good, with the waffles fluffy and the chicken mostly crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside (except for 1-2 pieces that were a bit dry). I was particularly impressed by the fried green tomato blt, basically a re-imagined appetizer of fried green tomato slices with pork belly and cheese slathered on top. The peach cobbler had a crisp crust and nice balance of cinnamon and vanilla. It takes 25 mins to get out of the kitchen but I felt it was worth waiting for. Everything was really a high-end restaurant take on traditional dishes, immaculately plated and great service and presentation.The only menu items I didn't see were fried okra and pecan pie. Prices were also rather high, S$45 for the fried chicken n waffles, and S$25 for the peach cobbler. Definitely not your everyday dinner hangout spot.We're pretty far away from the Mason-Dixon line, but I think I found a place to get familiar favorites. 3.5 stars due to the dry chicken and the elevated prices, 4 stars for the good service.",

I believe it's done by the same guy who did Yardbird in Miami (near my hometown!). \u00a0Look it up, it's famous and has won many awards. We ordered: the fried chicken, collard greens and hot fluffy buttery biscuits. Yummmm....No, this place was not cheap. The chicken was a whopping 35$$$! But in my humble opinion it was worth it. It has a nice thin crispy coating and when you dip the pieces in the accompanying hot sauce and...BAM! An explosion of true southern home flavors are flooding my tastebuds. The biscuits were pretty good. I would give them a 4.5 out 5. They could have been a little more fluffy but that's really just a small complaint because they were still pretty delicious.Collard greens are so hard to get right but these guys nailed it. The flavor and texture are spot on, spicy, vinegar and a little bit of sweetness. Soooo good. I will eat here every chance I get and I can't recommend them more if you want to try or are craving southern American cooking in Singapore (even at a super high price). \u00a0Oh and the service was too notch. Super fast, really friendly and eager to help us. Way to go guys!!! Love this place!",

I just squeezed myself out from the travel revolution held in the Sands Expo; eagerly looking for a place to settle down so I could go through the package details. It's a nice decent restaurant and it's not hard to tell by looking at how the host and hostess suited up. I was led to my table after got my name (I didn't have any reservation, it is solely for the purpose of greeting me and to make me feel respected). The waiter who attended to me was very polite and well trained who knows the menu very well. After found out the portion and the wine list, I decided to have the crab cake egg Benedict with a glass of Chardonnay. Trust me, the crab cake is simply awesome. It's not like some of the restaurants make the crab cake with 80% of batter and only 20% of crab meat. This one is opposite, you could get a mouthful of crab meats, so fresh and so yummy and the egg Benedict is perfectly done. It is heavenly delicious when you mix the egg yolk with the lemon hollandaise sauce ... mmmm..... Well, back to the reality ... time to settle the bill. The crab cake cost $30, while the Chardonnay is $25... not cheap but worth it.",

The menu pricing seems a bit off, as the Swine Burger is one of the cheaper menu offerings at $26, while a plate of chicken and waffles rings in at $45. The burger was all around fantastic--a mix of short-rib, chuck, and brisket, topped with pork belly--and is one of the best burgers you can find in Singapore. The fried chicken is excellent as well, and the macaroni and cheese is a must try.The only disappointment to speak of was dessert. We tried the Mississippi Mud Pie Flower Pot, which was quite small and just OK. At $18, it was hardly worth it, and I would be reluctant to try any of their other desserts, which all seem to hover around that same price point.Lastly, the service during both of our visits was very friendly. We will certainly be back for more!",
