Can't comment on the tea but I like the ambiance and good friendly service.",

    "text": "2 stars for the Service & Lychee tea.Met my long time friend who just got in town from Abu Dhabi. She suggested Arteastiq for tea originally but since we both had no clue where else we could go for lunch, I said maybe we can go to Arteastiq for lunch as well. Arteastiq is located on the 4th floor of Mandarin Gallery. I would have think a restaurant in such locale could not be too bad, of cos I was so wrong. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a staff. Ambience looked great. The staff suggested we girls to sit in the inner seating area since those by the windows have couches and lower tables; may be harder to eat a proper meal. I told the staff it was fine for us to take those tables next to the windows; I know my dear friend would be happier with a table with a view. I looked at the brunch menu and another larger meal menu. I did not find anything that was really interesting but decided to play safe and ordered the chicken and waffle. With the brunch special, I could get a specialty tea which I opted the lychee tea. My friend ordered some linguine with baby squid. She too ordered a lychee tea. When our tea came, we went wow!! Presentation definitely an A+, the taste of the tea is another A+!! There was a skewer of lychees, a pot of tea and some mini cookies. When our lunch came, I went Omg inside in a bad way. The chicken was all diced up and there was a hint of curry on them. My bad for not reading clearly, the Chicken & Waffle here is nothing like what a Chicken & Waffle should be in US. I got quite a shock and this dish was just a mutated form of the well-loved Chicken & Waffle back home. It was so heavy, and I still tried to eat the bizarre version of the chicken. I gave up half way. I sent a picture to a friend back in Atlanta, I told him that was my lunch - Chicken & Waffle. He texted back \"Wth!\"I balked at the pricing of the food here at Arteastiq. They are overpriced and the food is really just mediocre or in my case bad. Our clothing reeked of all the different scents collected from sitting too near the kitchen.This is at most a great tea lounge and the food here does not warrant that kind of money. I may come back for tea but never ever for food. Then again there are so many decent tea lounges in Singapore, I don't see myself ever be back here.",

    "text": "Wife and I came here because Lady Iron Chef recommended this place. Despite the 3 star average review, our overall impression of this place is as follows.Atmosphere: 4.5It's pretty cute and well decorated. It has a lot of props with a combination of an european, Asian twist to it.Service: 2Wait time for seating is pretty long even though we were the second party waiting outside for a seat. I think it had a lot to do with people just taking their time (both customers hanging out and chefs/servers taking forever to serve food). We ordered 2 dinner entree and the first one came after 20 mins and then we finished it and between the second entree it took another 20 mins for the second entree. Yet, we still haven't gotten our drinks.Food: 4We ordered the Prince of Monte Carlo-Short Rib sandwich. It was super yummy (5 stars). And we also ordered the Boston Love Boat Ciponio, i thought it was just okay (3 stars). There was a lot of shells, soup was decent, average. Wasn't bad, but wasn't wow either. Both the dishes came with sweet potato fries which was really good. But we could only have so much.Overall I think this place is more like a 3.5-4 stars max. While they have something unique going on as well as decent food, they really need to work on their turnaround time. It's ridiculous for anyone to wait so long for a small tea pot (2 cups) even if they're here to kill time. The table next to us was complaining about waiting over 30 mins and I can tell they were super impatient and annoyed.",

Well that's if painting with friends is up your alley. They would probably have to pay me to paint instead. Chill out on their comfy colored plush chairs and order yourself a tea concoction. I love those that are paired with alcoholic gelato. They are to die for plus they also come in these really interesting cups/glasses/bowls that you have to mix around. I never knew what i'm supposed to be doing with them other than to drink from it. Skip their tea sets, it is absolutely not worth trying even though it's not pricey. Instead, you may want to try their steamed apple/pear pudding. It's not fantastic but remember you're paying for the ambience than for the food.",

Bottled water was priced the same as their tea menu. ugh..What really made us disgruntled is the poor service. Very very slow, unresponsive and servers are obviously untrained.

Location:Nicely located in the middle of orchard road so it's definitely 5 star location-wise.Food:Meh! Don't bother to order appetiser or even mains. Food's overpriced and tasted horrible. The food presentation was nice to upload on Instagram but that's it. So it's only worth to order if you love taking good looking food and upload it on Instagram (hoping to make your friend jealous).Tea:Nice huge selection of iced teas and some great tea-flavored ice creams so I guess it's their specialty? I'm not a big fan of hot teas in the humid Singapore, so it's a good point that they serve delicious iced teas. Thus, I prefer this place over TWG. Ambiance:Great! Nice decor and comfortable seatings. Very conducive for intimate meeting with friends/partner.Price:Not affordable but reasonable considering the comfort level and location.PS: although they don't serve free hot/cold water but they allow you to get your tea pot refilled (TWG does not allow this). I would've given it 5 stars if the food was good and I couldn't rate it below 4 stars because of those alluring iced tea collection!!!",

But somehow the two parts felt very disjointed. Ambience: Was here on a Monday afternoon ... And so the crowd was mainly tai tais (rich housewives), their daughters and some solo book-readers (prob writers trying to get inspiration). The tea lounge is really nice - posh in a quaint and elegant manner (pastel colours, Victorian style furniture and jazzy music in the background).Tea: had its wolfberry and longan tea set which came with a mini biscotti and small mochi - very delightful presentation which transformed the tea experience to an all-new level.Food: I had some beef and chicken from one of the meat dishes my mum ordered (can't remember the name) - horrible horrible meat - too overcooked, not juicy at all and not flavoured enough. This place is obviously not known for its food ...I would come back here for a quiet afternoon with friends (or my mum again) over tea ... but not for its food.",

    "text": "I must admit that I heard countless comments from friends raving about their unique experience at Arteastique. Most of them went for the Art Jam (social painting and tea), coupled with some random experience at the dining section.For me, I was more keen on the Art Jam session. I made a reservation online (dropped them an email) and got no reply whatsoever for 3 days. After which, I decided to call in and make my reservation instead. I highlighted to the lady over the phone of my email reservation and she seemed unaware of it. I wonder, who is manning the email inbox? If no one is manning the reservation email, then why provide an email address for reservation?Anyway, food was pleasant. Service was expected and really nothing more; what could be said of young servers who know nothing of providing good service?After dining, we went next door for our slated Art Jam session. The \"lady\" at the counter was pleasant and comprehensive. However, I was sorely disappointed with the guide for the Art Jam session. I paid $88 for a Sat, 6pm-9pm session and our guide was spending 80% of her time concentrating 4 others who obviously had bought the package of 10 art sessions. Seriously, is this how you treat potential customers? Giving them only a preview of your time while making them pay FULL RATE? A good, indirect marketing ploy to get one to sign up for their 10 session package - sign up or get 10% of guide time only!Only because I love painting and art, that I am sticking with the session. In the end, we couldn't finish our painting within 3 hours and had to schedule to come back again at $10 per hour! My goodness! Why? All because our guide spent all her time ensuring the 'package buyers' could complete their art on time, under her studious tutelege (90% of her time). Personality-wise, the guide took a while to warm up but was quite nice.Speechless.Try it if you are really short of things to do on a weekend.",
