    "text": "Fish tacos ($18) - 3 stars3 hard-shell tacos with a token amount of greens. The filling of fried fish with salsa and a sliver of avocado in each was good, but I had been expecting soft taco shells, which I much prefer. At $6 each they're expensive tacos if not for the Entertainer app. They're quite average though and I probably wouldn't get them again.Oh my lard burger ($19) - 4 starsI love this name. I stole a bit from my dining partner and thought it was one of the best burgers I've had in Singapore! I'll have to go back to confirm this.Both portions seemed just a bit smaller than would fill me for dinner, but is the perfect size to leave you room for dessert, which sounds like an excellent idea. I loved the space, couches and there's free wifi available. I'll definitely come back if I need a space for a group meeting. Only downside was they played the same song on loop five times before I left. Music before that was great - The Script's The Man Who Can't Be Moved, Maroon 5's She Will Be Loved... my time...Service - 5 starsThis deserved a special mention!",

The service was patchy - friendly from some, completely non existent at times (e.g. server disappeared for a long time during our meal and we had to fetch own sauce from behind the counter). Very expensive for what we got. The food was mediocre - the French onion soup was watery, badly presented and unappetising. On the plus side, the drinks specials were good value, and my partners burger was cooked well. We've heard good things about the brunch menu so maybe will return to try that. Hopefully it will be better. I am not much of a reviewer but I really felt I had to say something after my experience at jewel.",

    "text": "This is one of two Jewel outlets in Singapore and at least in my opinion the better and more charming one. Coffee is the main reason to visit as they serve some really good filter coffee and I must say that my view is that they actually improved. If I would have written this review longer back it would probably have ended up being three stars instead of four. This is one of several nice looking cafes that have appeared on Rangoon Road as the area seems to really be going through its gentrification process.Besides the coffee they serve some nice brunch dishes and actually for me the highlight has been the pastas. They are an especially good deal on Thursdays when they have buy one get one free. Made with fresh ingredients and they make sure to actually make the pasta perfectly al dente. The space is nice and there is a lot of seats indoors and a few outside as well. Service has always been friendly here, the baristas know their stuff and food comes fast and they are on top of things so all together a good place to go for some simple food and coffee.",

Large portion of thick cut generic fries were pleasing but returned with more than half remaining because with the burger, the fries were too much. Beef stew was wiped out quickly as well. A little more toast would be great to mop out all the sauces :)",

I'd previously walked past the place while on my mission to Ng Ah Sio Bak Ku Teh and it'd caught my eye then, but we were there for BKT and so that was that. Had the Caesar Salad and Rocket Salad (with beef) (I was feeling really healthy today) which were both not bad. My dining companion asked for sauce and bacon bits (for the Caesar) on the side and they came in these pretty large bowls (considering it was just caesar sauce)... felt my arteries clogging up as I looked at the amount of Caesar sauce. Ended up taking about half of it. So generous but I certainly hope they don't actually dump in THAT much sauce into their salads. But apart from that it was pretty good! Also tried the ricotta pancakes which Sonya liked but I thought it was just a tad bit too dense... was really full after just 1 pancake (we shared)! Another guy at the table couldn't finish his either. Probably my second favourite in Singapore after Skyve's (though distantly behind).COFFEE IS A MUST HERE. Between the 7 of us we had ?4 cups of coffee of different types and they all came in these huge cups despite only being about $6. My mocha was really smooth too and didn't have that terrible acidic taste that I hate. TWO WORDS: GENEROUS SERVINGS. Will come again!",

Between this place and Chye Seng Huat Hardware, I'm going to have to give my pair of fake prescription glasses a rest between each use!The hubby and I decided to give this place a try; thanks to the trusty Yelp app that suggested it. We came here on a lazy Sunday morning, and it wasn't at all crowded. We were in the mood for something sweet, so I ordered the pancakes and he ordered the French Toast. Here, you have to choose between blueberries, strawberries, or bananas as your toppings- it doesn't come with all of them (although I wish it did! But then it would probably cost over $20.) We both enjoyed our plates, and I really appreciated how they drenched my pancakes in maple syrup! There are too many places here that only provide a small container of maple syrup on the side, which is a total buzzkill!If I heard correctly, this place sells Liberty Coffee, another popular roaster on the island. I don't think Miguel and I are experts yet in determining the differences between roasters, but we can say that we loved our cappuccinos.I guess I feel a connection with this place because it has these beautiful white tiled walls (which remind me of New York) and the natural lighting of course rocks my world. The fact that it's a 5 minute drive from my place is also a plus. It looks like their lunch and dinner menu is legit as well. A definite place to check out for a coffee fix, and a great environment for relaxing and reading a novel.",

    "text": "pretty darn good brunch food, which is not something to scoff at in this new wave of coffee joints. it's rather hipsterly located in the cooler part of little india, with a beautiful porch and a rather pretty interior full of whites and wood and metal.it's a decent menu by any standard, large for a coffee joint, reasonably priced, and the flavors are more than decent. definitely worth a visit.there was a pretty large group of us that day, and we managed quite a few dishes on the menu. the breakfast one is filled with classics like french toast and pancakes - both served with lots of syrup and ripe berries, which made it more than delicious. the pancakes in particular I can judge - both because I had them and also because I love them greatly - fluffy, american-style, and not dense at all.the eggs went down pretty well (by which I meant they seemed to be eaten quickly and without complaint) - so you probably wouldn't go wrong with a croque monsieur or poached-egg-do.the lunch menu kicked in at noonish (or was it elevenish) - and I think that was pretty well-done. fried pork bites came tender alongside a dip of kecap manis, and a mushroom soup was redolent with a lick of truffle oil and actual fungi bits.the beef salad was topped with slices of pink, tender beef, and another was topped with moist, tender chicken breast slices (none of that dry stuff) and a poached egg.if you're in the mood for something heavier, the chilli crab and fish roe ones (separate dishes) were both good, though the first was heavily spiced with ginger (and might be rather disconcertingly so).the food is delicious, prices are reasonable, service is prompt and obliging, and the cafe is plain lovely.",

Thus, even though a wine fridge was spotted, they can't serve it.Among 8 of us, we ordered a variety of drinks: milkshake, iced chocolate, tea, coffee. All were not good. They tasted of too much sugar and of poor quality ingredients. And I asked if they serve liberty coffee since they are right next door, and our server said no. Why?? Support local!Worse, we were seated upstairs at the couch, and for some reasons, that area was buzzing with two million mosquitoes! Yes, we are in AC, but these bloodsuckers are relentless! Much as I want to like the place, I doubt I will be back.",

    "text": "I just spent 45 minutes trying to log onto my hungrygowhere account and setting up a yelp account to write this review. I've been a fan of jewel cafe at shenton way and was excited when this branch opened up. The excitement was short lived.Second time here, this time decided to have breakfast, in addition to our usual Gibraltars which I would typically order at shenton way. I ordered the yogurt with fresh fruits and granola at $9 and two Gibraltars. If the yogurt is anything to go by, this would be my last visit to jewel at Rangoon. The serving size of the yogurt did not justify its price tag. I've ordered yogurt at other cafes before and this was by far the most overpriced bowl (more accurately, shallow plate) of yogurt I've had. What was even more offensive was that the yogurt was not served with granola as described in the menu, but a few sprinklings of oats and a few sad slices of fresh fruit. I find it incredibly offensive when restaurants try to pull a fast one on their customers. I won't even bother with my thoughts on the taste of the dish as I wasn't even served what was described on the menu. I don't know what possessed me to finish that sad bowl of yogurt. Maybe I was too hungry to care at that point. But by no means was I happy with it. I gave my feedback to the staff when paying up, and asked if that was granola or oats. Staff looks at menu and says it reads granola. Trust me, I can read. My point was, that was definitely not granola but oats. I also mentioned that I found the serving size too small. I wondered if the said staff relayed my feedback to anyone. I should also mention that I had asked if I could have two poached eggs, without the extra fluff (toast, hollandaise etc). I was informed that this could not be done. I had to go for the full works as listed in the menu; all or nothing, essentially. Well, no matter. I won't be coming back.",
