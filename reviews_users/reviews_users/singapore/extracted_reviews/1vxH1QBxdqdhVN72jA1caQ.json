    "text": "There is no doubt about it, the Steakhouse serves one of the better steaks in Singapore. Much better value than some of the more high end Steakhouses, but giving little, if anything away in terms of quality. I have not tried their starters, nor have the group I have eaten here with ordered anything except the steak or the lamb. Good selection of steaks both in terms of cut and from USA, Australia and Ireland! \u00a0Normally more of a ribeye than a sirloin person, the Irish Grass Fed Sirloin is well worth trying, as are the Grain Fed ribeye. One of our group swears by the Tenderloin. \u00a0Sides are good quality, service is pretty good, sometimes a little brusque, but that's a trademark of Singapore service unfortunately. Carnivores should give this a try. \u00a0You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Luckily I didn't come here on my dime. I knew it would be on the expensive side, so I was expecting an amazing steak. Maybe one of the best I've ever had (since I normally don't go to steakhouses).I was split between the Australian Wagyu Ribeye and the Filet Mignon. Since I don't normally see wagyu on menus, I decided to give it a shot. The wagyu special came with \"truffle\" fries and a wine or beer for $73 ($54 USD). The steak wasn't terrible, but it was on the salty side. I love anything truffle, so I was getting my hopes up on the fries. Unfortunately, these weren't house cut fries, and I couldn't taste any hint of truffle on the fries. If it didn't say it on the menu, I wouldn't have known there was truffle oil on the fries.I finished the meal off with cr\u00e8me brulee, which was on the \"meh\" side. I've definitely made better cr\u00e8me brulee at home.Wasn't terribly impressed with this place for the price.",

Well, to be honest, they don't have the best steak in the world, but the way the accommodate customers was really remarkable. The steak was ok- huge portion and tender, the taste was average, but compare to other places in Brooklyn, this one has better service around to hunt!",

Location in Clark quay means no restroom facilities, so that's a bummer. Steak knives were huge but not sharp. You'd expect better quality based on the ambience.",

(Just a burger and linguini)We were just about to leave before the main course and the waitress told us that they were only 3!!! which is totally unacceptable for this price level restaurants.This was also the case for 2 other tables beside us. The food was ok but very overpriced according to its quality and service provided.",

    "text": "great fillet steak and as expected at a higher prized restaurant, perfectly cooked medium rare. took it classic with butter, salt and pepper but if you wish you can also cover your great meat in blue cheese sauce as so many do. side dishes are good but nothing spectacular. wine list is good, even the house wines. had oysters as starters, also, good quality. oysters, steak with mashed potatoes and 2 glass wine plus martini = 180$",

    "text": "We visited The Steakhouse on Chinese New Year. Our visit was not the best as the steak was cold and not prepared as requested. The spinach was also cold on delivery.My friend had the Pork Chop and it was prepared nicely as requested, but we had to wait a long time (30 minutes) for the other items to be prepared again. For a fine dining restaurant, this is not acceptable and we will not return. Our bill was $300sg and the staff did not make any adjustment for the long wait while one party was eating and the other was waiting for the food to be prepared again.",

    "text": "For a full review, please visit: urbanjourney.com/food-an\u2026The Steakhouse delivers a sizzling, sophisticated culinary experience inside with an impressive menu of premium Australian and US Black Angus Beef and a delectable selection of seafood appetizers that have all the making of a perfect surf & turf experience. We started off with the New England Clam Chowder, which as natives of Boston, we are always skeptical of ordering outside my hometown, but Chef Manuel Gruber has an interesting take on this Boston classic, piling in a hearty portion of New Zealand mussels and bacon bits to give it a flavor all its own.When it comes to the meat, our cut is almost always the intricately marbled US Black Angus Rib-Eye cooked medium rare (closer to rare) sprinkled with a bit of salt to lock in the full flavor of the meat.  For the sides, you can't go wrong with Creamed Spinach or Grilled Green Asparagus with Bearnaise Sauce and either the Potatoes Gratin or Mashed Potatoes as welcome accompaniments.If you've saved up enough room for dessert, then we recommend diving into the White & Dark Mocca Mousse, which is a delightful set of flavors that nicely balance off the salty meat flavor from earlier. Put all that together with some friendly conversation and a couple glasses of their admirable red wine collection, and we are all but certain you will walk away satisfied, albeit quite full and a bit lighter in the wallet.",
