The Durian Mousse is rich and intense in flavor - great if you like the king of fruits. Pretty creamy consistency too. Other durian desserts include a durian crepe if you want to double down. Other local favorites like honeydew sago, jackfruit sago, and mango ice are all nice options that satisfy a sugar craving.All up, Dessert Bowl is a cute spot for something sweet. Heard this small space fills up in the evening but we had plenty of seating on a weekday afternoon.",

As you walk up the stairs, you're greeted with durian and more durian smell. Lining the walkway on the second floor, there's miniature models of Singapore. This place is definitely all about the dessert variations of durian: durian mousse, durian-misu, durian ice, durian shake. So many desserts with durian inserted! Prices were reasonable at around S$4-10 per dessert. I'm...not particularly a fan of durian, so I actually ordered the sweet pear with fungus, which was good, but you can probably get something similar at other dessert shops.Cute sofa seating by the window and smaller intimate tables in the restaurant. Laid-back atmosphere for a chit chat and dessert with friends or just to treat yourself.",

The name \"Dessert Bowl\" kind of ring the bell and we took the opportunity and headed for the 2nd Floor.Dessert Items and photos were pasted along the stairways up to Dessert Bowl and you can sense the intermittent strong durian and mango fragrance once you swing open the glass doors. As soon as you reached the 2nd level, you will be greeted by the sunflowers and the sudden splash of greyish black environment.Seating places were spacious with 4 sofa seating by the side by side to the glass windows looking out to the roads. Furnishings were simple with movable tables and stools on the cement screed flooring.Noted as their topped recommendation will be Durian Mousse. I must admit I'm not really a die hard fan of durian but the amount of flesh given in the middle was great. Mousse tasted good and even having the whole bowl of it, you just would not feel cloying.Durian Mousse \u69b4\u83b2\u6155\u4e1d - $5Colors of Aiyu Mango comes in 2, Orange and white. Aiyu was wobby with mango cubes. Coconut milk is added into the dessert bowl. On this hot weather, the bowl of chilled desserts really help us to battle with the heat. On a side note, this dish is classified as their 2nd popular dishes after Durian Mousse.Aiyu Mango \u7231\u7389\u8292\u679c - $4.20The miniatures display of typical Hong Kong Stalls had captured my attention.Display from Bakery to Roasted Meat and Cha Chan Ting were a good introduction to what you can see in Hong Kong.Since I had visited Hong Kong 2 months back, they little stuffs were a reminiscent of my trip.With limited stomach space, we didnt get a chance to try their Mango Pomelo which is the 3rd recommended and popular dessert. When will I be back again?",

A tiny entrance that leads you up to a noisy bustling cafe. You could smell the whiff the durian even before pushing the door. Definitely not for those who are non-durian lovers.We were there around 7pm, was fairly empty and quiet. It's a strange order process. Best to get up on your feet and head over to the cashier. Think they are a cash only establishment.We ordered a durian mousse and a mango pomelo. Recommend to have the mango pomelo before the durian as the durian will overwhelm your entire taste bud. Both were super yummy, thick and delicious. When we were half way through our dessert, probably 730pm by then, it suddenly became really busy and noisy. All tables were taken and a queue forming. Due to the structure of the cafe, noise get trapped in the shop and it can get quite unbearable especially with the shrieking laughters.Great place to hang for awhile after dinner.",

    "text": "Been wanting to try this place for at least half a year now.. And yes, managed to try it.The store is at the 2nd level of one of the shophouses. And upon entering, there are mini diy items on glass boxes (furnitures, decorated houses/living rooms). Then you will see two side tables after the stand where the waitress greets. You will also see four sofa seats with longer tables that can accommodate larger groups towards the glass windows. We were quickly seated as there wasn't much crowd at the time of arrival. Was given menus to look at and a laminated paper with animated version of mangoes implying that the mangoes are sour (probably not in season). But it took my friend awhile before figuring out what the sign actually said. Being a psych student I am trained to read those signs easily. Decided to go for the durian mousse and the mango pomelo with sago (two of the three recommended desserts here).Tried the mango pomelo with sago first. The mango is sweet and sour, the pureed mango was pretty well done (not too runny). The pomelo has no taste (wonder why) and the sago are a little too soft. The durian mousse... Yumminess!! It reminds me of a durian milkshake I had in Rosemead (California) and the ice was blended well that there wasn't any rough texture in the durian blend. And they even put a generous portion of D24 durian in the bowl. Price wise it is pretty reasonable. I also noticed probably 80% of the customers who were there ordered the durian mousse. Portion was also reasonable as well. Even though the interior design was just painted walls with some signboards but both my friend and I had a good laugh reading one of the sign boards as it doesn't make sense. Definitely need to try out the famous durian mousse if you are around Chomp Chomp :)",

Mind you, I love the fruit but I have never been a big fan of \"durian products\" e.g durian ice cream, durian cake, durian dodol, durian cendol...so I had my reservations. And from the photos, it seriously did not look THAT great...And then it came... .... Still nothing to look at.... ... And then I tasted... Yummy!!! It's like cold creamy durian.... Sooooo good :) please bear in mind that I'm not a fan of durian products \u00a0There are loads more stuff on their menu that I won't mind trying...

    "text": "My favorite local dessert place in Singapore. If you're a durian lover and haven't tried this, you're doing yourself an injustice. This place can be tricky to find since it's on the second floor on a relatively inconspicuous street in Serangoon Gardens, but look out for a sign overhead that points to dessert bowl upstairs. You can smell the durian the moment you walk in. My 2 favorites are the durian mousse and the mango pomelo sago. Their mangoes are always succulent and sweet, though when the mangoes that come in that day don't live up to their standards they'll serve the menu with a page that says \"Mangoes are sour today\". Either my taste buds are off or their standards are pretty high, but I got the mangoes a bunch of times when they claimed it was sour, and they were all very sweet to me. The base of the mango dessert is mango mousse, which tastes like a blend of mango and ice and maybe some cream? A great change from the shaved ice base you normally get at hawker centers, which relies on syrup to sweeten everything and leaves you with a watery mash at the end of it. Love love love their mango pomelo sago. The real star, however, is their durian mousse. It's like eating pure, cold durian without the sticky sweet aftertaste. Their durian mousse comes in a base that's clearly pure durian flesh blended with ice and cream, and comes with a scoop of pure durian flesh. If you love durians, this is a bowl of heaven.Come here with friends after a heavy dinner at chomp chomp and I promise you won't regret it.",

    "text": "Dessert Bowl \u4e00\u7897\u751c\u54c1 as its name suggests is a shop that specialises in desserts. This shop tucked away at the second level of a shophouse, in the heart of Serangoon is a hidden gem! With less than 5 years since its inception, this dessert place has won the hearts of many of my friends with some claiming that this is one the best dessert shop! I have not heard of this place till recently. I was also quite skeptical as even as I made my way to the shop. It was next to a KTV, the shop signage (above) was not (how should I put it..) inviting. In addition, the surroundings was dark and quiet. Once you get past the first entrance, there was a steep flight of concrete stairs with no one in sight. I would have turned back if I was alone or did not trust the source. Luckily, we braved on continued on and ventured into the darkness.At the second level, the contrast was distinct! The dessert shop was bright, vibrant, bustling and full of people. Phew!The decoration of the place was unique and impressive. Old Hong Kong theme with several displays showcasing miniature stalls of what looked like Hong Kong's Cha Chaan Teng in the olden days. It was captivating as the details were not left out. Dessert Bowl is essentially a small dessert place with a small seating capacity. It was very noisy as there was no absorbent material used. The concretes walls and glass displays coupled with the small area amplified the noise. It was extremely difficult to have conversations in such an environment. The menu cover had a cute baby smiling out, enticing customers. The most common words you would hear at this point in time would be 'Oh, so cute~!'.The Durian Mousse $5 was highly recommended. It did not disappoint. It was served with durian flesh added on top of the durian mousse. The durian mousse was perfect; of the right consistency. It was light and smooth with small chunks of durian in it. In addition, the flavour of the durian was not overwhelming. With the addition of the durian flesh on top, it was literally the 'icing on the cake'. This Durian Mousse is a must try! It hit the right elements in all aspects and was utterly delicious! Coming from a non durian fanatic, I think that this speaks volume! (Those who have read my previous posts would have know that I am not a fan of durian)The Aiyu Mango $4.20 was one of their bestsellers. It consisted of mango puree, aiyu jelly and coconut milk. This was another refreshing yummlicious dessert. Each of the three ingredients complemented each other well. To conclude, Dessert Bowl \u4e00\u7897\u751c\u54c1 is the place for dessert! I would highly recommend the Durian Mousse even if you are not a fan of durian, you should give this a try. Do not under estimate the crowd at this dessert place. As we were leaving at 1030 pm, a queue had formed near the stairwell. Do note that the ambience is not ideal as it can get very noisy. Detailed review: foodiefc.blogspot.sg/201\u2026",

Not sure why but it's interesting. IF you love mango this will be great. Top picks 1. Mango pomelo2. Mango Sago 3. Durian crepes/ Durian crepe/ Durian Mousse - these can be really strong so Durian haters beware. Definitely will go back for the food again (if the crowd doesn't put me off).",

I particularly like the kiwi-based desserts as the fruit used is of the right sweetness and texture (not too sour and crunchy, as what you might expect with unripe kiwi).The ambience is nice: overlooking the posh terraces and quiet neighbourhood at Serangoon Gardens. The interior is vibrantly coloured in yellow, and plush red sofas occupy the side of the shop with the window view. The walls are plastered with photos of - no, not people who have visited the shop before - travel locations like Taiwan, for instance. I should add that as the shop space is rather small, it can get a little echoey at times.The store is located on the second level of the shophouse: look for the hanging sign pointing to the staircase that will take you here.",

Its like having all your durain flesh nicely peeled away from its shell and blended with the slight touch of cream and served up chilled - with little pulps in it still, no less. Absolutely divine.

It would be more prominent at night as the lights in the store will make it more obvious to spot. It is quite an interesting sight though, watching people eat inside through the glass window, from the street level, it is as though they were inside a gallery.I must say their desserts are unbeatable, and at a low price. It is a nice place to chill out with friends over a nice bowl of shaved ice or some drink. The durian mousse has got to be one of my top favourites there as it tastes really authentic. Service was not bad but sometimes the staff might seem a little rushed, because they are serving many people at one time so gotta give it to them.",

    "text": "Craving for a nice cold bowl of Mango Sago dessert? Well if you are in the Serangoon Gardens area, Dessert Bowl is your answer! It is super popular among youngsters as a hang out spot as well. Situated on the second floor of a shophouse, it has always been perpetually packed every single time I visit! Of course their mango sago dessert is the star item but they do have other desserts which are worth trying too. They are also especially proud of their durian concoctions, including durian cream. They are made with the real stuff, and enough of it for you to feel like you are having a durian. That being said if you don't like durian then don't step into the place because there will inevitably be the smell of durians.",
