    "text": "BBQ chicken ranch pizza ($22.50) - 2.5 starsGot this without the ranch dressing because ranch dressing is bad enough on salads. I ordered this because every other pizza seemed to come with a cream base. The pizza was really spicy for me - it tasted like they'd used chili oil and there was a little fire in my belly for an hour after. It was pretty good but not many ingredients - just the chicken and some salad leaves.With the Entertainer app it wasn't too expensive but I'm not sure I'd come back for the pizza since there weren't enough ingredients. The seafood pasta looked good so maybe I'd try that.",

    "text": "Twi-hards, Count Dracula's high court and Underworld hard core fans may want to steer clear of this cheeky Korean chain. \u00a0With a name like Mad for Garlic and dishes on the menu like the famous \"Dracula Killer\", the restaurant is loud and proud in declaring it's love and liberal usage of garlic.Personally, I love garlic and I ask for most dishes with extra garlic, a whimsy the kitchen is always happy to oblige! \u00a0We usually start with the Dracula Killer, with baked garlic and anchovies served in an escargot pan, paired with bread. \u00a0If you don't care for anchovies, the garlic bread is also delicious. \u00a0For mains, I usually stick to the pizzas and pastas. \u00a0I'm a fan of the garlic snowing pizza, which is strange because I usually don't like pineapple on pizza, but somehow this works. \u00a0The garlic carbonara pasta is delicious but heavy, so you may want to share it!If you saved room, the garlic berry ice cream is decidedly interesting. \u00a0For something more traditional, the Oreo cheesecake is delicious.PARTING THOUGHT: If garlic really does help prevent cancer, dining out here may be just what the doctor ordered!",

    "text": "Finally tried out Mad for Garlic this outlet over the weekend. Always saw a long queue around dinner time so I thought I'd give it a try and purposely came to this outlet at 5 pm. At that time I came there was no queue at all. I ordered for Lobster cream pasta - it is priced at SGD$23.50 - on the menu it is marked as one of the signature dishes - and the only signature dish for pasta. This is the description of the dish: garlic cream sauce pasta rich in lobster meat and fish roe. It came exactly as it is described in the menu, however I can very much tell that the chef used frozen lobster - and that makes me wonder: what is so special about this place? I mean honestly, taste wise the pasta overall is just very standard. Then ingredient wise is also very standard. It's not fresh or anything special (yes the word \"lobster\" does make it special, but seriously though). Why would people want to queue so long for this kind of OK dish? I've tried pasta much better taste than the one here (at Mad for Garlic) and priced much lower. Regardless what makes me decided to try out this place was because of the hype. If you are like me, please save yourself and come during the off-peak hours. Otherwise your disappointment will be too great to bear.",

However, would totally not reccomend this restaurant to anyone if you can't eat much garlic! Went there with friends yesterday and tried the pasta and snowy pizza. As stated by its name, they put so so much garlic on top of the pizza and tons inside the pasta which makes my stomatch feel really really sick until now. The restaurant would better to have the level of garlic that customers can be aware and choose their proper level in order to advoid a bad situation happening to them like my case.",

For those that say the garlic is overpowering.. well, that's the point. dont eat here if you dont like the smell of garlic. -1 star because it's a little pricey, but not surprising due to the atmosphere and sizeable food amounts. I would recommend the garlic bread tower, caesar salad, suicide rice (seriously spicy, but good) and the pasta.",

    "text": "Went to try this restaurant as we tried the one in Korea but got really disspointed with the quality that was not the same despite they claimed they had a Korean chef. Didn't taste any garlic at all on the dishes we ordered except the garlic bread. So why did they still call the resto Mad for GARLIC?? The Med Jack Nachos Pizza somehow was better than the Carbonara or Arrabiata pasta which both were tasteless and not garlicy at all. For the prices which are at a very high end (lunch set @$18++ & the Pizza @$23++) with such SO-SO quality, we would not come back. 2 Lunch sets with Pizza totalled $70 with indifferent quality, Better go to another place!!! The music was more like a pub kind versus the one in Korea which is full of instrumental music creating a fine dining experience.",

    "text": "50 metres away from the Esplanade MRT station in Suntec City tower 1, this is definitely not the best pizza or risotto place, and certainly not the cheapest one. Yet, this place is clearly popular and the food is not bad. Don't expect anything unusual on the menu: pizza in 6-10 different ways (I had pizza with different cheeses, not exactly quattro formaggi, rather theAmerican version). Risotto and spaghetti in 4-5 different ways (with garlic, or what did you expect). Wine by the glass is 9.5 or 12.50 \u00a0not exactly a present, and the Erdinger was 17.5 SGD, more than Belgian beer. What attracts people here? The atmosphere? Naja. Rather loud. ANd I wouldn't come here for a romantic dinner, although there are clearly young couples here. The only reason for me to come here: it's near to work, and to have a drink and bite with colleagues, well OK once in a while..",
