    "text": "Best come in early so that one will get the window tables. No additional charges for wet tissue. Service was great with a stool given to put my bag.Deep-fried Rice Roll with Salted Egg Yolk Shrimp \u8106\u76ae\u9ec4\u91d1\u867e\u80a0\u7c89 (S$8.80++)The thin silky rice roll was stuffed with salted egg yolk sauce coated shrimp, topped with soya sauce. The shrimp was coated with a light and crispy batter.Pan-fried Siew Mai with Foie Gras Sauce \u9e45\u809d\u9171\u714e\u70e7\u5356 (S$10.80++/ 4 pieces)Not sure what was foie gras sauce but the sauce here was more on the sweet side. The siew mai was topped with sweet caramelised crispy lotus root, finely shredded ginger and shrimp roe. Nice texture although the ginger could be a bit too overpowering.Deep-fried Mango Prawn Roll \u9999\u8292\u6c99\u5f8b\u867e\u5377 (S$6.80++/ 3 pieces)Best have this while it was still hot and crispy. Thin crispy crust, inside it was packed with shrimp, juicy mango, and mayonnaise. Sliced Fish Congee \u9c7c\u7247\u7ca5 (S$9.80++)Simple plain looking but full of flavours. Firm slices of fish and crispy slices of you tiao, in the smooth porridge.Accompanied the meal with a glass of Daily Herbal Brew (S$4.80++) which came recommended by the staff. It tasted like luo han guo \u00a0\u7f57\u6c49 \u679c . Not too sweet.",

    "text": "really good family-style dimsum at vivocity - I mean family-style in the best possible way: I think yumcha is best for large noisy family meals. I've been to a fair share of posher establishments where the dining is more european-quiet and dimsum arrives in dainty dishes - but there's nothing quite like sitting down to a meal in a restaurant where everyone is just as loud, and over-eating much as you are.well-executed dimsum classics in this mainstay singaporean chain - with reasonable prices and a great view overlooking sentosa, this place is a favorite.I suspect you'll soon go bored of me telling how good the food is, so let's just cut the verbose short: there wasn't a single thing I didn't like. it's dimsum that's familiar and comforting, so while it's not going to score high on innovation - it will get you points with the parents/in-laws/guests for having had the genius of bringing them here for classics-done-good.a must order: stir-fried crab meat with egg white. so silky and delicious. we ate a heck of a lot, and left very happy - the bill was surprisingly small, the place was packed but service was quick if a little hectic, and the food was great. terrific.",

    "text": "Good dim sum at reasonable prices, the odd thing is they only serve pei dan zoke (century egg and pork porridge) on public holidays and weekends. What sort of self-respecting dim sum place does that?The interior is modern and brightly lit by natural light, with a nice view of Sentosa and the water in between. I like coming here with my family as it feels like what \"yum cha\" should be.Siew yoke (roast pork) here is decent, \"su pok pok\" as the lady who presented it to us said, cripsy and tender in the right places. Scallop chang fen, carrot cake, mango prawns are good too, in addition to the usual har gao, siew mai, fong zao (chicken feet). A pretty sumptuous lunch for 2 came up to $50, including one order of siew yoke. Will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "This place is popular for a reason. The dim sum served here is above average, and some of their cooked dishes are really good as well. Try their stewed eggplant, it's been a long time since I've tasted eggplant that tasty! On top of the ordinary dim sum selection, they have a few interesting items as well, combining ingredients popular in other cuisine like foie gras. I really enjoyed the food, as well as the ocean view. The salted egg custard buns are pretty good too, especially if you like salty sweet buttery goodness oozing out into your mouth! :)",
