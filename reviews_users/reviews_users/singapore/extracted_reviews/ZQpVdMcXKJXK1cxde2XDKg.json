The crispy little crabs were delicious and the fried corn was a delicacy I have not had anywhere. The price is double what I pay at my fave ramen place HiroNori in Irvine, CA but well worth the price. We'll hit it again on my flight back to MNL fromSG.",

    "text": "The first Ippudo bar in the world (or so Google tells me), from one of the most popular ramen chains in Asia. While that pedigree sounds good, it's food was acceptable at best.I'll just comment on items of note since most of the items were nothing to write home about. I ordered the summer special duck tsukemen - I thought the lime they provided really gave it a nice refreshing touch. However, they also served the ramen with 3 greasy pieces of grilled leek (unsure why they needed that much oil) and smoked duck (was hoping for seared duck). The ramen was enormous though, so if you're carb loading, it's perfect!I really liked the spicy potato salad which was surprisingly awesome with the slightly spicy meat sauce. The fried eggplant sandwich with meat sauce was also pretty decent.There was no line on a Sunday evening but I'm not sure how crowded they get. There's a small selection of sake and the usual ramen suspects. I might only return for the potato salad but I can make that myself so... Would I really do that?",

As the outlet was currently having a $9.90++ promotion for its Extra Rich Tonkotsu Ramen to celebrate its 7th anniversary in Singapore, the place was packed. The turnover was fast and I got a table almost immediately. Ice water was free here. Extra Rich Tonkotsu Ramen ($9.90++)Served with chopped spring onions and 2 slices of cha shu. The cha shu was rather thin and the texture still have not reached the melt in the mouth stage and had a bit of porky taste. The soup seem to have watered down to suit the local's tastebud. The ramen was done just nice to my liking.Crispy Corn ($6++)Lightly-battered deep-fried corn-on-the-cob, sprinkled with smoked paprika powder for a burst of different flavours.It looked coated in a rather plain batter, but it tasted addicitive with a Maggie like flavours, filling the mouth with umami taste. Can't help having one after one although the corns tend to stick between the teeth.Chashu Tsukune Bun ($4++)Juicy minced pork patty accompined with crisp lettuce and mayo in freshly steamed bun.It was served pipping hot. Could not taste the mayo in it, but the patty was surprisingly good, even when it was minced very finely. The texture was buttery, melt in the mouth. I wish I could eat another piece.Overall the food was not bad. Service was fast.",

    "text": "I was inclined to giving this Ippudo at Shaw a 4 stars but on my way out the chefs/staffs in the kitchen simply raised my rating to a 5 :D haha!! How? They said thank you in Japanese and I smiled and nodded at them. I suddenly realized they did not just say it like many places do while those staffs were working away not even looking at the customers. I do not need a robot or robots saying \"Arigato gozaimasu\". Maybe these staffs really said thank you for the sake of saying but they must be darn good actors. And one of them is quite cute I must say, haha.So my experience at Ippudo at Shaw...I love Ippudo located in Ginza, Tokyo very much. The staffs were nice and the ramen was excellent. The gyoza was perfect. At Ippudo in Ginza, those complimentary little snacks/appetizers were placed on the table. Here, the staff gave them in a container divided by two compartments to customer. I have no complaints about that, I do not eat them. They were too spicy for me. I am sorry but I have to compare this location to the one located at Ginza. I do like the ambience here at this Ippudo but I love the one at Ginza even more. It was a lot more cozy there. I ordered the small sized Shiromaru ($12) on the lunch set and added the Tamago egg (+$3). I asked the staff if the Shiromaru came with chashu (pork slice) cos if not I would add the extra chashu (+$5). She said the bowl of ramen came with two slices of chashu. I like ok, two would be good for me so I did not add extra meat.When my ramen came, I only saw one slice of meat :( Thank goodness it was a good size of meat. The thing about me is I can't have no meat so I will not be reviewing any salad place for that reason. The gyoza were good, slightly edged out those at Santouka.I am pretty sure I would be coming back to Ippudo in Singapore very soon. Glad I got a chance to try out Ippudo here and finally crossed out one of the \"a place must visit\" on my list.",

Can choose texture of noodles - soft, medium or hard. Soup was a bit rich but at least it was piping hot.Side orders: egg and satsuma age (fish cake) - comes in a soup.

The menu is slightly limited in ramen choice, and it didn't have my favorite Karakanen ramen. It, however, boasted more creative appetizers such as the soft shell crab and beef tartar, which was amazing. Did not particularly like their spin on the tonkasu ramen with the \"Singapore\" flavors because it tasted like black pepper crab sauce. I wanted japfood! Other than that, it was really good. Quite pleased with the appetizers!",

    "text": "Okay, I have to admit I've never tried the original Ippudo in Japan, but was mighty impressed with the one in KL, perhaps it was the very favourable exchange rate at that time. Have to say, food wise, here in Shaw Centre, the ramen (I had the one that was exclusively available at this branch only, each branch has its own exclusive ramen) was good, but not the crazy good that I would queue 1 hour for (and I've actually done that before). Just good. No extra stars for this part. But the service, oh boy the service, TOP notch! My bad I didn't get the waiter's name. It's probably the best service I've gotten since returning from the States. At one point, I even caught myself wondering if this guy was working extra hard for his tip. He anticipated our next moves with ease, upsold me an extra portion of ramen (kaedama? Good value for only $1), convinced my son to try a dessert. This guy was smooth, all whilst making us feel comfortable and well looked after. He alone has garnered this pace the 4th star. So, I will come back again, only as long as my unidentified waiter is still there. If he's gone, I'm gone. On wandering with my quest for the perfect ramen in Singapore.",

The broth is tasty, just a tad salty for my taste, but the noodles are done just right. I absolutely love the boiled gyoza here, but I find the size of the dumplings to be pretty small for the price. Also, though the charsiew is tasty, it isn't quite melt in the mouth. So all in, though I do like the food here, as well as the wide variety on offer, am withholding a star since it isn't quite my absolute favourite ramen place.",
