    "text": "The martabak! The martabak manis has passed my Indo aunt's test. My aunt happened to be in Singapore when I bought the martabak home and she had a taste of it. I chose the mix which had everything - cheese, chocolate, peanuts, sugar and butter. I could even taste the condensed milk though it was not in the menu description.Her verdict: Very similar to those found in Jakarta as it was very rich unlike Singapore's version (min jiang kueh peanuts sugar or red bean flavor)I have to agree. The martabak brought back memories of my aunt bringing this (and many other goodies) into Singapore whenever she was here for a visit. It is that good. I really hardly see this on the menu in Indonesian restaurants so for the moment, this will be the place to go if I get craving for this. The menu also includes the usual noodles and rice but do not expect much. It is quite simple fare but jazzed up a bit. I tried the black pepper bakmie but I did not really like it. I will be back to try the usual bakmie and bakso though.",

    "text": "JTown Cafe is a small outlet in Midpoint, selling Jakarta street food at reasonable prices, and somemore in orchard area. It is located across from the food court. Although the selection is not a lot, the place is packed during lunch with the office crowd with most having its lunch sets priced at $5.90.Bakmie Ayam ($5.90)It is actually indonesian chicken noodle, served with a cup of iced tea.The iced tea is bland but refreshing to have in such a hot day.The noodle comes with a bowl of soup, filled with 3 pieces of beef meatballs.I like that there is a lot of crispy fried shallots in the noodles. Remember to add the spicy tangy chilli sauce from the counter. The heat from the sauce adds extra kick to the dish.Martabak Campur ($3.90 regular)indonesian pancake with mixed topping of peanuts, chocolate rice and cheeseAs I am too full I decide to take this away which costs another $0.20 more. I like the texture of the melting cheese, the crunchy nutty peanuts and chocolate rice which makes a yummy dessert.Overall the food is not bad. No wonder the place is packed during lunch.",

    "text": "Kind of an authentic Indonesian food. The staff members were all friendly. The ambiance is casual. It gets pretty loud inside too. I've been here three times. The first time I came here, I ordered their original bakmi ayam ($5.5), the seasoning was good although it's a bit on the dry side so I needed to ask for more chicken oil, with springy noodles done just the way I like it, martabak ovomaltine which was impressive (apparently it tastes pretty authentic according to my Indonesian friends), siomay (Indonesian siew mai) which was awful because they used too much starch with only little meat used and fried dumplings ($2.5 for 3pcs) which is my favorite aside from their bakmi.Second time I came, I tried their popcorn chicken bakmi ($5.9) and since then it ultimately became my only favorite here, it is so simple, tidy, spare, and absolutely spot on. Tried soup dumplings too but not as nice as the fried version. The meatballs though, it's pretty good. However, neither dish is meant to be complex or overly adorned.Kitchen is really small so expect a slow service but prices are reasonably affordable so can't complaint! Remember to ask for extra chicken oil to your bakmi for better taste. I wish I could give this place more than 3 stars because I LOVE THE BAKMI! But too bad that's the only food \u00a0I like here so I guess 3 stars it is. PS: Everything is halal",

The portion sizes are generous and I'm always full after eating here. I always come with the intention to try the martabak but never have enough room to try it. Perhaps one day, I'll just come here for the martabak.",

Friends from Jakarta say that its pretty close to what you can get there.The chilli-ed up Mee Goreng or the Black Pepper Bakmie is definitely recommended. Don't forget the sinfully sweet Martabak dessert. Do share with a friend.Lunchtime crowd might delay your food a bit though. Its a small kitchen after all.",

    "text": "I LOVE THEIR MARTABAK MANIS. After consulting with all my Indonesian friends, this is probably one of the few places in SG that sells legit martabak manis. I always get the coklat and keju, not much of a fan of having kacang in it. Sometimes they burn it a little, but most of the time its delicious. I brave the hoards of Orchard shoppers just to get to this place. Given that it is one of the few places that does sell martabak manis, its a bit expensive (esp comparing to how much cheaper it is in Indonesia -__-) but when you have a craving you have to fulfill it ^_^. But its worth it. You'll have to wait about 10 minutes for them to make it since they don't have it just waiting in the corner, which is awesome and well worth the wait for the thousand calorie pleasure. Also had their bakso which was also pretty good. Its quite easy to get to, its right across the street from Somerset or take a bus and get off at Midpoint Orchard.",
