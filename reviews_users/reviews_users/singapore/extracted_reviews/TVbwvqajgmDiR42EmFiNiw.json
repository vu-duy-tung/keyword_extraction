I was taken aback by the decor and of course the view of the beautiful Singapore skyline. Once seated, our server arrived promptly and took our drink orders. He was very attentive and took the time to walk us through the menu and was confident answering the questions we had. He was there whenever we needed refills, etc. without being annoying or hovering over us the entire time. The food was excellent as well. We tried a chicken and a steak dish which were both great and came with delicious and generous sides.I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would recommend/go there again!",

To be fair, the view is spectacular but you can get this view without having to spend $300+ for a meager, mediocre, shamelessly overpriced dinner. They even charge $20 for a window table. Disgraceful. On top of everything else I had to take an Alka Seltzer when I returned to my room as the terrible pork meal made me ill. My consierge is going to hear about this!",

The service was extremely professional and welcoming from beginning to end, which only enhanced the experience.The food selection was great, and very seafood oriented. They included things like oysters, mussels, scallops, sushi, and rolls of different kinds. They also had a good selection of other hors d'oeuvres and dessert options, ranging from cheese & crackers to chocolate dipped fruits.Make sure to see if you can get a seat by the window! The panoramic view of the city is pretty spectacular.",

Its only redeeming feature is the spectacular view which they milk to the hilt - charging $20 for a window table in an otherwise empty restaurant. Lastly, the food was average - if even that and amazingly overpriced for the quality I was utterly disappointed and we paid $250 for this disaster.",

I bet it was just one ounce. I forget how much each drink was, but remember thinking it was not at all worth itthe fish was good, seemed fresh. and service was 4-star. but I'd set your expectations accordingly, i.e., you come here for a special occasion when you can sit by the window, but not for the highest level of fine dining or value",

Otah, soba, dim sum, chicken drumsticks, bread and a few pastries here and there. Nothing out of the ordinary. For the desserts, I tried their chocolate fondue, fruits and cakes... nothing memorable sadly. The view though, was breathtaking. You can see what feels like the whole of Singapore. Ended up feeling like I was there just to see the view, not for the food. Perhaps their lunch and dinner will be better than their high tea? I have to come back here and try it out.",

We ordered the tuna tartar with avocado and it was divine. It was delightful with all it's added ingredients and all blended well when ate at once. For our main course we ordered the angus rib for two and holy holy flips on fire, while we were waiting, a waiter surprised us by showing us the HUGE piece of meat before he sliced it. We were ecstatic! I was worried because I wasn't really looking forward to the normal fine dining minuscule portions that leaves you still hungry afterwards. The beef rib was succulent and cooked perfectly. Everything was above average!",

    "text": "Located at the 70th floor of Swissotel the Stamford, Equinox is helmed by Chef de Cuisine Lee Bennett and offers mainly modern European cuisine. For lunch, Equinox serves up a semi-buffet with a single order of a main course flanked by both appetizers and deserts buffet. \u00a0Lunch at Equinox usually goes for S$59++ but for restaurant week a special price of S$40++ applies instead. Sweet!Besides food, Equinox is better known for its astounding view that enables diners to glimpse beyond Singapore to the isles of Malaysia and Indonesia. We were lucky to get a table that was only a seat away from the window and was able to enjoy the magnificent view without the glare of direct sunlight upon us.The appetizers impressed with the variety as well as freshness of the offerings. From sashimi and sushi to cold seafood and foie gras and smoked salmon, the dishes were mostly well-executed and were the highlight of our meal. In particular the foie gras pate with jelly was exceptionally delicious albeit a little too rich for me to enjoy more than a single portion. The spread of cold seafood included two types of oysters, prawns, crabs as well as mussels and clams.On to the mains, which our server politely informed us would require 20 minutes for preparation and which we could request at any time while enjoying the appetizers. My guest had the Grilled Salmon Fillet with Herb Crushed Potatoes, Caper, Shallots and Tomato Salsa while I had the Roast Breast of Chicken with Pommes Pur\u00e9e and Chasseur Sauce. After the excellent appetizers, we were severely disappointed by the mains. The only praise that I could give was that both the chicken and salmon were cooked just right. However, this is underwhelmed by the sauces which were overpowering and which did not go well with the dishes at all. A rather uninspiring attempt and we would have been glad to skip the mains completely.Deserts consisted of ice-cream, cakes, pastries, cheeses and a chocolate fondue, among other things. I especially enjoyed the chocolate fudge with caramel and mango panna cotta which looked pretty and tasted delicious.For more pictures and the full review visit voraciousappetite.wordpr\u2026",
