Deco is traditional and really nothing to shout about but the food is good, in particularly memorable:* scallops and broccoli in XO sauce* fish maw soup* steamed grouper in light-sauceWill definitely return. :)",

    "text": "I had just attended the National Day Dinner which had its chinese sit down dinner catered from Yan Palace.1st course : Cold Dish CombinationThere was 5 dishes in this dish : crispy fish skin, salad prawn, fried egg, black fungus, deep fried prawn roll.Most people were not taken with the black fungus especially with the older generation. Although the black fungus was crunchy, it was lacking of flavours.The crispy fish skin was everyone's favourite as it was light and crispy.The prawn roll looked like crispy yam roll, filled with crunchy prawn filling.2nd course : Double Boiled Black Chicken SoupThe soup was a way too salty for most people. The meat of the black chicken was quite tender.3rd course : Baked Herbal DuckThe meat was quite tender and filled with tender soft, melt in the mouth chestnuts.4th course : Braised Seafood with vegetablesThere was clams, fish maws, shiitake mushrooms, whelks, cabbage, and dried scallops. The dish was well braised.5th course : Five Spice RollsThere was way too much onion in the rolls, and lacking of the crunchy texture from water chestnuts. It was served with a spicy squid salad.6th course : Steamed Sea BassThe fish was steamed with soya sauce, and topped with a meat and preserved vegetable mixture. The meat was firm and juicy.7th course : Steamed Herbal PrawnsThe prawns were juicy but can barely tasted the herbal part.8th course : Braised Pork Belly PauThe braised pork belly was quite oily, and could do with a longer braising time as the fat still did not have the melt in the mouth texture yet. It was served with pipping hot bun.9th course : Mango PuddingWish there were mango cubes in it. Lacking of mango flavour.Service was uneven. My dining partner who was having vegetarian, got left out of one course. One staff remembered but served her with a vegetable dish with dried scallop in it. The following course she was served 2 courses together.",

    "text": "We came here for Sunday dim sum and it was not that crowded. There are private rooms if you wish to have that. Apparently this place has been around for years, and is popular with the older folks who remembered going there for wedding banquets and other occasions. Maybe they are better for their dishes as I saw many tables ordered that instead of dim sum stuff. I find the dim sum very average. If you are used to the Cantonese style or the more refined and delicate taste of dim sum, this will be a huge disappointment. I place them in the same category of Swee Choon, Red Star and Mouth Restaurant. The only items I like are the century egg pork porridge (looks small and plain but is actually tasty) and BBQ pork buns (soft fluffy bun with plenty of nicely charred and moreish BBQ pork). The fried rice lacks the wok hei flavor and is quite tasteless. My nephews who are \"fan tong\" (love rice a lot) basically shunned it. The XO fried carrot cake is also not that great (Taste Paradise does a better version). The dessert is also mediocre. Another item which seemed popular is the vinegar pork trotter which did not show up. It was sold out but the staff did not inform us when we ordered. The service is average, typical of such old school Chinese restaurant. It can be better, and it did get better for those who know the people there.",

I especially liked the roast suckling pig. Even with a large group, the food was served in a timely am fashion and every dish was hot when it got to us. The steamed fish was also very very tasty. I would certainly go back. The meal was reasonable priced as well.",

    "text": "really, really surprisingly good chinese food at this dodgy-looking, super old-school restaurant in chinatown. the place definitely seems to have had better days - the exterior is just as worn and outdated as the interior, the servers are cantankerous and grouchy, but the food - the food is good.and - I meant surprising in the sense that I didn't actually expect the food to be good, with expectations further tempered when I saw the restaurant, and it all turned out to be decent - with some dishes actually much better than average (objectively, all other things aside).let's talk about the restaurant first - the unimposing entrance to the place completely belies the hugeness of the dining area. we're talking old-school, banquet-able (in the region of 20-30 tables, possibly more?), with a huge stage in the middle and private rooms surrounding the side. it looks like it would have been impressive in its heyday, but the furnishings are now pretty worn out, and the staff looking nearly as tired as their surroundings.but thankfully, the food completely outshines all these (not that it's terribly difficult to do so). there are some proper cooks in the kitchen that churn out proper cantonese/ teochew food, most of it arriving at decent intervals.the duck: skin was well-browned and crisp with the fat well-rendered away, and the meat was succulent (even if the duck was slightly on the skinny side). a pretty good start.the mainstream sauteed dishes were also pretty decent - silky mushrooms with greens, and pork cubes in a sweet-savory sauce. the latter was a tad fatty - but that's how the old folkies like it, and that's almost definitely their target demographic.the seafood dishes were better, like our steamed prawns or a DELICIOUS steamed fish? we finished with stir-fried noodles (not many ingredients apart from veg and noodles, but it wasn't oily, and was properly dry-fried) and a dish of mashed yam (orh nee). the first arrived when we were rather too full to appreciate it properly, but the latter went down in spite of the too fullness (my dad had seconds, rather impressively).",
