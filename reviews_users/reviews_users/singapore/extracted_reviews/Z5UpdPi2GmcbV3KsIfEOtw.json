Refer to my other review below - those items were better!Blackforest cake ($8.80) - 3.5 starsThe alcohol taste is strong but pretty flavorless - enough to give me a hint of headache for nothing. I liked the cherries, but there's too much cream and too little cake - and it's the sort of cream that's tasteless and greasy. Not many cherries inside.Tiramisu - 4 starsVegetable salad ($12) - 3.5 starsGood.Vegetable lasagna ($11.50) - 3.5 starsGood!Smoked salmon pizza ($8) - 1 starWay too salty!",

It is a very good, albeit not healthy, piece. The caffe latte is also very good. The salmon and horseradish sandwich had a bit too much horseradish but it was by no means a bad sandwich. Overall, a very good place to drop in for breakfast, brunch, or a snack. Also a good place to get some work done.",

    "text": "Gastronomia has been a mainstay at Chip Bee for awhile and recently went through a minor revamp. It used to be solely focused on take aways but they now offer seating space with an extended menu to choose from for a simple, fast meal. Cafe plus takeaways! And it's never crowded, and a nice place to sit with a book, a friend, or just a cup of coffee. A surprising fact is their breakfast offerings (which goes on all-day). Very inexpensive, and huge portions. Scrambled eggs are creamy and good, and their egg sets can come with smoked salmon, sausages, according to your choice. Huge portions for around 10 - 15 bucks. They also offer soup + pizza combinations, and I think some sandwiches (haven't tried this). Get your breakfast cravings here and be more satisfied than elsewhere at Holland Village. I'm very happy about their revamp.",

He picked up the veggie lasagna which was bursting with every veggie and lots of flavor. He had the beef lasagna and loved that as well. Both takeaways were big slabs of lasagna, easy to nuke in the microwave and then gobble down. He also got the baked cheesecake and that was also very nice. Of course this place has happy hour with good specials we'll have to try next time.",

It's more relaxing than the main holland village stretch, and quiet idyllic.I had a sandwich and a cottage pie. Everything was freshly baked on the day itself, and my sandwich came stuffed full of goodness. The bread was crisp on the outside an still warm, while the cottage pie was very hearty and tasty. Still, it wasn't anything to shout about. Like it's coffee. And I'd have to be really hard pressed to make my way all the way here just for pizzas or breads.Ambience wise, it's nothing really special. The chairs aren't too comfortable and it's got a very limited seating capacity. Definitely no good for large groups. Still it's clean and cheerful, ad the glass front lets in the afternoon sun.The large colourful meringues caught my eye but I did not get any as I was stuffed from my \"snack\". I'll definitely be back to try them if I'm in the neighbourhood!",

Everything in that fridge is delicious, made of high quality ingredients, relatively good value on a $/g basis and packed in a convenient albeit non-environmentally friendly container.Despite attempts to contain my greed, my partner and I religiously eat 2 desserts every week. I like all the chocolate cake permutations, especially the giant $8 slice of chocolate & vanilla sponge. I also love the lemon tart sans the sweet frosting on top. He likes the dragon role and tiramisu (if you want to prevent addiction, DON'T touch this pick me up!).If you live in the area and need a quality dessert fix to go with your video ez DVD rental for the night, Da Paolo is it.",

This upmarket Italian deli is very consistent and I have come to rely on them for last minute dinner party details often rushing in for some grilled veggies and cheeses. The desserts in the fridge might look modest in their little plastic tubs but don't be fooled by appearances. The hazelnut crunch cake is perfection and they do a damn fine tiramisu. Skip the cupcakes. They store them open air with the air con blowing over them so they are dry dry dry. If you get there first thing in the morning have a fresh doughnut or croissant and an espresso.",

Located in the tranquil neighborhood of Chip Bee Gardens, Gastronomia has a decent selection of pasta sauces, antipasto, mains and pizzas that you can just grab and go. Probably won't be the meal of a lifetime and isn't exactly the most economical solution to your laziness but one has to make do with shortfalls. The salmon pizza with pesto is a great choice to accompany beers during game night. If you are have about 15 minutes to spare and put in a tad more 'effort', get some tagliatelle and arrabaitta sauce to put together in the kitchen later on. Sauces tend to have little ingredients though, so stop by the Cold Storage across the road to grab something to spice it up if you will. If it is a hot day out there, have a scoop of gelato before you make your way home - it's nice enough to put you in a better mood.",
