The green tea flavor was lacking in the mille cake while the chocolate cake was rich in flavor. The strawberry shortcake had a nice balance in sweetness and texture. Probably had better cakes for the price but would recommend it if you haven't tried layered crepe-cakes before for the experience.",

    "text": "Two floors for this shopfront was pretty amazing. But one of my friends who is also an architect said that they could use some of the spaces to expand their seating areas.Came here at 9.20pm and there were queues for both take away and dine in. Looking at the display cases, there was not much choices left. Decided to get Apple Galette as it is specially baked at the Orchard Central branch for take away. Service was extremely slow. Probably because it is closing time and people are trying to take away or get their bills. Even though it is a big space, there is only one person in charged of the cashier, one person in charged of cutting the cakes. While standing and waiting for my order to be served, besides the lack of staffs they have, I noticed that most of the customers were impatient to get their orders. The waiting time was pretty long - 20-25 minutes even though they just had to put my order in a box without any plastic covers like the ones they put on the cakes. Was pretty disappointed at the service as I experienced a much better service at the Marina Square branch.Besides that, people was not in order especially at the take away section. They had to cut off the queue as it was about to close and they only had a few baked goods choices left when customers suddenly poured in. Since this is the first review of this branch, I will give a starting of 4 stars hoping that there is a change in this store in the upcoming future. I definitely love the modern touch for the interior design but would be better if there are more seatings in the store.",

The reaction, \"meh.\" The original was a bit too sweet and the chocolate one isn't firm enough to stand up--it fell apart after the first cut.And they don't have decaffeinated coffee or espresso.",

The banana cake was so so as I felt it was old. The crust and banana seemed aged. Possibly not a high turn around on that one. The espresso actually has potential. Tasted like it was extracted properly. BUT it came out cold. Cold not even luke warm. I guess do to the pre order process of the place. Oh that. We waited 30 minutes for a seat. The venue is charming but it designed not to hold many seats. End result? Line up for a seat. I still think for 8.50-9 for any cake is a pretty good deal based on the quality. Of course bearing you are willing to wait.",

Floor-to-ceiling windows stretch across an entire wall, offering an uninhibited view of the pedestrians bustling below. The other side is lined with mirrors, which adds to the illusion of vastness. Tables are lackadaisically scattered across the two floors, creating a pleasantly bizarre look. My company and I got a slice of the Signature, Matcha and Chocolate (~$9 per slice). Each individual crepe is thin as a tissue sheet and meshes well with the adjacent layers of flavored cream. I especially loved the signature slice: without any extra flavoring, one can easily taste the freshness of the cream. However, past the first few bites, the richness of the cream becomes apparent and overwhelms one's senses. The simplicity of the cake becomes its downfall: there is nothing to mitigate the overly-rich taste of dairy and unfortunately, this ends the dessert on a sour note. Service is sadly incongruous with the extravagant and upmarket facade. Wait staff are clearly untrained students who seem more inclined to fiddle with their phones or chit-chat with colleagues. To conclude, despite the desserts failing to live up to the hype and price, this beautiful establishment is undeniably one of the best places to chill at along orchard road.",

The rest I've tried (including the special earl grey and chestnut flavours) aren't as strongly flavored or delicious. This location can be quite echo-y though. Not recommended for people who have issues with loud noise.Also, you need to share your millecrepe with a friend. Otherwise, it will be too gelat (i.e. you will be too glutted to enjoy it)!",

    "text": "Passed by Lady M at Orchard Central one day. The place looked contemporary, sleek and definitely looked like a place I would want to try. Took a quick look at the menu outside, they had pictures with yummy cakes. Told my sis we should do brunch one day and suggested Lady M.One Sunday morning, we arrived at what looked like the main entrance on the first floor. Lady M is a two floors restaurant. We arrived there at 10.40am, only to realize the restaurant opened at 11am. Never mind, we girls could check out the Zara nearby. Of cos, my niece and nephew were unhappy or should I say bored? After many many minutes passed, it was 11am and we went back to the restaurant's entrance. The \"Closed\" sign was still there and the door locked. We waited and waited. It was almost 11.10am. My sis got her kids to go to the second floor and see if that door was opened. From what I read before that day, the second floor entrance was for patrons to purchase and pick up their pastries. My nephew got back to the first floor and told us the door on the second floor was opened. We took the elevator at the mall, to the 2nd floor and headed to the restaurant. There were already a few other patrons heading into the restaurant. The two staffs seemed lost and did not know what to do. People started flowing into the restaurant. The restaurant seemed understaffed.We chose the table we wanted to sit and soon one server gave us a few menus.We ordered a few pot pies and paninis and two slices of cakes - the original Mille Cr\u00eape and Banana Mille Feuille.The Black Pepper Chicken pie which I ordered was really really good. The pie was golden brown and really crispy. There were chunks of chicken and mushrooms inside the pie. The pie is definitely an A+ pie. The pie came with coleslaw (with raisins, a first for me but the combination was spot on) and some seaweed potato chips. Mille Cr\u00eape - Very very nice. However, I could see why some yelpers complained the cake fell apart after some time. The cake really needs to be refrigerated and not sit out for too long. Best to be consumed in the restaurant.Banana Mille Feuille - Disappointing. The taste was good but there was way too much cream. There was more cream than the pastry. Like 90-10. I can make a better Mille Feuille.The Banana Mille Feuille was not what caused this two stars review. In fact, it was the pies and pastry that helped Lady M earned these two stars reviews from me. It was not even due to the alright service from the staffs or the fact that someone clearly forgot to open the door at the main entrance. What I could not get over was the amount of filth on the floor at the restaurant. See pictures. Doesn't anybody clean the floor before the restaurant opens every day? This is a restaurant for goodness sake. I felt the place lacks of basic restaurant hygiene. If no one cleans the floor, I wonder what it was like inside the kitchen :(Without the food and pastries, I am sure I will give this place only a one star (for the decor).",

It went splat when I cut it with a fork, with the filling oozing out and the layered crepes flattening into a mess. So maybe it will be better to have it in store, or put it in the fridge if you buy it to go. I had mine about 30 minutes after purchase. I did not think it will require refrigeration as I was going to have it within an hour. The place was fairly big and encompassed two levels. Go directly to level 2 for take out as the cakes and cashier are on that level.",

    "text": "The first time my friends and I wanted to eat here, the queue was too long. The 2nd time, I bought a few slices to take home. Not bad, the cakes were delicious. Finally, last weekend, I had a chance to get the full experience.It was Sunday at 8:30 pm. Got in through the ground floor, up through the staircase, saw a staff member (female) who told us to queue outside. On the way out, another staff (male) saw us and said \"thank you for coming\". He thought we had already finished eating. \u00a0Got to the queue and found no one there, waited patiently. In a short while the male staff came to usher us inside. On the way to our table, we bumped into another group coming up the staircase, looking for a table. While the male staff brought us to our table, the female staff took the other group to another table, without asking them to join the queue (there were a couple of people behind us). The table assigned to us was on the side of the staircase. It was difficult to get on the bench, and on the other side were high bar stools. Not easy for my elderly father, so we immediately requested a different table. I called the female staff 's attention, this was just after she had brought the other group to their table. I asked for another table and told her that the other group had cut the queue. She did not seem to realize that. We ordered a banana crepe and a chocolate ganache. Both took more than 15 minutes to arrive. They tasted ok, though I felt cheated because the banana crepe was mostly cream, with a few banana chunks. The chocolate ganache was rich and tasty, not too sweet.Overall, I think this place is just over hyped. The staff are friendly and helpful but the physical structure, with staircase and 2 entrances, do not help them at all. If I were the manager, I would strictly use the ground floor for exit only, to avoid confusion. The cakes are delicious, but not worth $9 for a slice.",

I went on a weekday evening at about 845pm, near enough to closing time and there was still a queue. Waited not that Long, went in and noticed how big the place was. There were tables but i Guess they were understaffed. After they took our order (3 coffees, one water, two slices of cake) it took over 15mins to arrive. My Friend notice that that person slicing the cakes were so inexperienced that cakes that were being sliced were uneven and somewhat not that appetising. So the cake itself. Multi layered as it is supposed to be, nice texture and creamy and sweet cream filled between each layer. We had the chocolate and their signature. Preferred their signature one. The chocolate one was rather hard and each layer was sort of mushed together by the layering of the cream which is a bit too intense. Anyways, for our order, bill came up to about $40. Don't know what the hoo ha is all about, Glad that I tried it, won't go back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I'm in a dilemma to give this place a 2 or 3 stars. Food is not bad, but......Popped by for desserts after dinner with friends at around 9.30pm, and it's my first try at Lady M which I told my friend if green tea mille crepe is sold out I'll prolly not get anything. We just wanted a \"quickie\" and head home to rest since we are all working early the next day.We were joining the queue while we spied with our little eyes that there are many available seats. Me being me, walked straight to the service crew and asked if we could take their big table seating outside the cafe. So yes, we beat the queue and took our seat.The cafe was fully packed, so I went ahead to queue for take away in hope to ease the waiting time. I was standing there for a good 20 minutes before anyone spoke to me. A GOOD 20 MINUTES FOR TAKE AWAY. There was only 1 customer in front of me at the cashier. Entire service crew based on my observation include, 1 cashier, 1 lady inside the crepe area extremely busy cutting the crepe without stopping, 1 service crew whom I observed her job is to fold up the boxes and pack the crepe if there is any takeaway (by the way this crew has an issue if this is her only job scope), 1 service crew inside the kitchen, and 2 waiters, 1 to serve the dine-in and 1 to seat the customers.I was standing in a very awkward position in the line. There is an open service window for the servers to collect the mille crepe to serve dine-in, which intercepts with the cashier. So the waiter walked to and fro in front of me while waiting for this lady at the cashier ordering The good 20 mins allow me to observe how the entire team work and failed at their service. I think service could definitely been stepped up and better manage, to ease the queue into the cafe, to acknowledge customers' presence for take away, to fully utilize their existing staff strength, to better manage their cake distribution, ETC. Too many loopholes.I was really losing my patience since my friends and I were really tired and almost left for the day, the lady in front of me finally finished her orders! I jumped straight to my orders, when the cashier suddenly stopped me and carried out his SOP of telling me what are the items that ran out of orders. Actually I really can already see from my queue FOR THE PAST 20 MINS and have back up plans for orders that ran out, so I thought his explanation was really unnecessary and probably that explains why each order took so long. I snapped, but the cashier handled \"this nasty customer\" well. He lost a little patience too, but eventually tried his best to cool me down and returned wrong change.Eventually, I settled for a green tea mille crepe and a banana mille feulle for 4 to share. Both tasted really good, and ended my night on a sweet note. I like the creamy fillings of the green tea mille crepe that is generous yet not greasy, and the chunk of banana in the mille feulle (a little too much cream for this though). It's well balanced on the flavors!We finished, pack and go within 20 mins. It's not worth the wait for these mille crepes, and yes I will return only if there is no queue at all, be it take away or dine in.",
