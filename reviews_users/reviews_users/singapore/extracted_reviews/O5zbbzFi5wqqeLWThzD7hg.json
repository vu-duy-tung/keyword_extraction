The chicken wasn't available until 8:30 and the cheeseburger brioche bun had run out. They made the burger with white bread instead so now it was more of a cheeseburger/sandwich (still delicious and definitely good enough as a main). They comped us the brisket nachos since they felt bad about the chicken and brioche sich. Which was extremely nice and uncalled for. Keep in mind that they DON't add gratuity to the bill, only GST. We found out after we left and feel terrible about not leaving a tip for such warm service.",

    "text": "Good barbecue does NOT come cheap.Meatsmith is up there with Decker's as legit as American barbecue can get in Singapore. The ribs are fall off the bone tender, with some coming in dry rub versions and multiple choices of sauces to choose from. I'm told they had their smokers shipped in from the US.For variety, I simply go for the S$95 BBQ platter that comes with ribs, brisket, smoked chicken and some bone marrow. It's not a huge amount of food by any means, but it will keep ordinary stomachs sated. The cauliflower and blue cheese is pretty good, but the rest of the sides are rather run of the mill. To set your expectations, I'm comparing this to a couple of places I've been to in Memphis (including Central BBQ), Atlanta and LA. It's not the best barbecue ever, but it's decently good barbecue considering that you're in Asia. 3 stars if this was a place in the South, 4 stars cos it's in Singapore.WARNING: It's going to cost you a pretty penny to get your barbecue fix in Singapore, and pretty much almost double the price you'd pay compared to a place in Memphis, Austin or Atlanta.",

They were very proud of their bar and cocktail making abilities. \u00a0Being that I am on a diet (trying to loose a few - well actually a whole bunch - of kilos) I told them cocktails weren't for me but I would have a Fernet-Branca ... if they had ... and they did ... Impressive.The menu was not, by any measure, verbose. \u00a0That's the way I like it but my wife wants all the details. \u00a0After some explaining we had a plan. \u00a0We ordered two (100g) of brisket, three vegi sides and some pig's ear in lettuce. \u00a0To drink: the afore mentioned Fernet for me along with a pint of Pilsner and a (very large) glass of a Malbec for my wife. \u00a0The wine was great, the pilsner good, and the Fernet a Fernet.Food quality was excellent: Perfectly smoked meat; crispy pickled jalapenos; very good slaw and a superb (for me) wedding between a Vietnamese salad in a lettuce and a Nebraskan pig's ear. Yummy.The ordering system could use a tune-up. \u00a0People should make up their mind at the table, THEN go and order. \u00a0The hole in the wall gets very crowded when people are trying to decode the menu \u00a0and order at the same time. \u00a0Also, ordering drinks at the cashiers isn't ideal - drinks should be ordered at the bar. \u00a0It's a new place - I'm sure they will work it out.Great food - good prices - excellent potential. Have fun!Thanks for the tip Patrica from across the street :)",

    "text": "Tried out the new place in the hood for dinner. The overall atmosphere of the place was unique and well-crafted. But (perhaps it's because the operational staffs are new) the service experience overall was not to the best. Everyone was definitely friendly, but the waitress made mistake of brining the wrong food to our table twice during the meal, unintentionally \"teasing\" us with food... but nothing unbearable. Anyways, most importantly, here goes the the food review: * Main: Pork belly with crispy skin - The pork belly was deliciously cooked, maintaining the juicy, chewy texture without being overly greasy (I don't know if it even makes sense to say that pork belly is not greasy.. but still.). And the crispy skin... it was delicious..if you can cut it. The taste itself was good but it was not cuttable. Thought of bak-kwa but with 10x stiffness. All in all, pork belly itself was impressive, crispy skin needs to be mastered. Very small portion. Brisket- It was a-ok. It definitely wasn't the best dish, and the portion was WAY TOO LITTLE. It was a joke. One slice of brisket and that was it.. when coupled with the price we paid it was kinda sad. Nashville Fried Chicken- THE BEST DISH of the day. With the small portion of the two above, my friend and I had to order more food. But this turned out to be the best of the day. It was very saucy but the chicken was fried just right and the house-made bun, was very good. I finished the entire bun (I try to save my carb-quota with only the worthwhile carbs, and this was worthwhile.) * Sides:Som tum slaw - I liked it. It was a good twist to the regular coleslaw without trying too hard to localize the taste. Lightly sweet, just right. Squash casserole- Also pretty nice. Good substitution for mac-and-cheese. I think Meatsmith definitely knows food. Every menu, including this one, knows the art of moderation to not cross the line of too much richness or too much greasiness for barbecue food, a category in which a lot of chefs/cooks cross that line. (Meatsmith, are we also thinking mac-and-cheese? Maybe it's just me but I always think of mac-and-cheese at barbeque places .. just a feedback!)",

My only complaint was that they were cold, like just out of the fridge cold. That aside they were excellent. The slaw was ok, nothing to write home about though. Also tried the mac and cheese which was pretty tasty. The desserts are basic but good. Chocolate pie that tastes homemade. Apple cobbler with smoked ice cream, sounds strange but is a surprisingly good combo. I felt it was good value for money, $70 for 2 glasses of wine, a main + side, dessert and a bottle of water.

I also love the super serious face of the chef with his camo apron who occasionally peeks out from the back. \u00a0You know your meat, good sir!Never change Meatsmith...no other BBQ food in SG even comes close!",

Here, it is $50. For one rib. Also, you get no sides when you order a main. Not even a scoop of cole slaw. That is bogus and BS. Stop trying to nickel and dime your customers, Meatsmith.",

    "text": "We got crowded out of our choice dining spot during restaurant week, which was fine by me as Meat Smith was high on my list. We ordered the signature beef rib for the main and the chicken liver for a starter. First off, beef ribs are a little fatty in general so be warned. The rib was well prepared and the chipotle bottled sauce was quite nice. The only downside of the meal was that the toast points served with the chicken liver dish were quite soft and obviously had sat around for some time in the humid kitchen.I really enjoyed the lunch, but the sticker price (S$65 with bottled water) was quite high for a lunch where you split an entree. That said, where else are you going to get some quality bbq in Singapore? I guess you pay top dollar for limited supply.This place gets quite boisterous during the lunch hour so don't expect an intimate experience. The menu is also rather abbreviated, but the offerings seemed on point.Will return again to try the brisket.",

My host had brisket and he loved it. If they could have comp MAC or potato salad w sandwich, would be nice. Probably a neat casual place pau Hana (after work) for some frosties and BBQ. Give them a try, pleasant staff, felt right at home.",

Food was not too bad though and the menu has lots of American food which I miss and can't wait to try!! However it is not cheap, considering it is not a fine dining restaurant and more a casual hangout.",
