    "text": "Very disappointed. The quality of food was exceptionally poor and what is worse are the steep prices (for that quality). There are plenty of amazing restaurants in singapore you can spend such money at and have much better quality food. There were 10 of us and not one was impressed. Everything from starters to pizza and pasta - all very disappointing. Although some did enjoy the desert, I was so put off by the time I finished my main I was in no mood for desert. Please take it from a foodie and don't waste your time at this restaurant.",

Nothing great about it, but I was full, and happy and would go back ! We were only people for an early dinner so no issues with service like others have commented .",

I admit I do love bread and I like to spread a thick layer of butter.Went there for lunch on the weekday. The overall service is alright but the serving seems to be a little slow.We order a few side dishes to share and each of us order the main dish. I order a pasta with a lot of cheese and that dish is cheese overdose. Can't really remember the name of the dish but I have posted a photo for view.",

Our glasses were never refilled, and the wait for our food to be served was longer than an average wait. Not to mention that the restaurant was so very hot on the inside, so eating a hot dish was almost unbearable. For the price tag here, I would expect much better service and the restaurant to be cooler in the inside than the outside.",

It is a rather cosy and romantic set up, perfect for dates.They serve Italian food, lots of bread and pizza. The service is good, they take the initiative to clear dishes when needed and to do water top ups. The prices are slightly steep, but they do follow up with great food and good service. The ambiance and dim-lit cosy styled interior does top of for a lovely evening.",

    "text": "Way overpriced Italian food.Came here on a quiet Monday night around 9pm, fortunately about 1/4 full, so no problem getting a table. I had read about their prices, but was still shocked when the bill came - there needs to be either better prices or bigger portions as I wont be back.Started with the 2008 Rosso wine ($103.58), and a delicious drop of 4 year old Italian red - but when the house wine starts at $81, you know these guys are jacking the prices up for the foreigners.Appetizer was the Seafood Antipasti ($41.20) which was a nice large plate of mostly clams, one prawn, one scallop, 1/2 a slipper lobster and the odd octopus. Great starter, but like I said, needs to be bigger for the price.For the main, got the Crudaiola Pizza ($34.13) which was decent, but became very soggy as the fresh tomato juice continued to seep into the dough.Another beef, add the freaking service charge and GST into the menu prices. My first and last time at Forketta-ble.",
