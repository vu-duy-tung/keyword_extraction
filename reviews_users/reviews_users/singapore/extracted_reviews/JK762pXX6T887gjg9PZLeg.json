Tip: get a membership with the faber group for unlimited cable car. Also give you discounts at shops and 20 percent off the bill which should pay for itself. I think going for 20sgd now. May be a promo.",

    "text": "The view is absolutely gorgeous, over viewing the sparkling city of lights, the bay and the lovely island, and it's especially better at night. The decoration is very well done, with LED strips on the stairs, soft lighting in the roof, and a fake candle on each table. The restaurant is flexible to dietary requirements, but not all of them. The restaurant generally isn't too packed, and the atmosphere is great; quiet with good music playing in the background, and the air conditioning helps loads in the hot Singaporean heat. Also located next to the Bell or Happiness (look it up if you don't know what I'm talking about). The food was also pretty good quality for what we ordered. The Chilli Crab, whilst the chilli was mild, was ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING DELICIOUS! The chips were perfectly cooked, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The beer and wine was good, but the wine glass could be bigger, but the wine is extremely expensive, one tiny glass is worth a whole bottle. The chicken wings were greasy, but otherwise enjoyable. On our night, a group of four were dancing to the music, not sure why, but they were. The service is quick, and efficient, so I was happy about that. I'd definitely recommend this place for a good night out, but be prepped for some expensive items, and some reasonable prices items.",

I have to say, this has got to be the most awful \"curry\" I've ever had!The curry was served with minced meat, there was hardly any broth or curry of any sort. There was nothing curry about it, it was SOLID. To add to it, the whole thing was served with dry rice crackers with the overly salty minced meat titled \"green curry\".Overall, I have to say I'm REALLY disappointed. One of the worst meals ever.",

The menu was a bit shortened due to holiday period, was there was still enough choice. We took the roasted chicken, which was one of the recommendations on Chope. And boy, they were right. The chicken was so tender, full of flavor and the sides just matched perfectly. Great diner, great views !!",

    "text": "The view was gorgeous, the hike was enjoyable, but the service was h.o.r.r.i.b.l.e. No one came to us when we waited to be seated for several minutes. After being seated, no one came to give us a menu, or ask for drinks for awhile. I'm talking at least ten minutes. It should also be noted there were less than 20 guests there, and roughly 5 waiters.After going up to a waiter and asking to be served, our drinks came at a nice speedy pace.... But we were given someone else's food. We then had to flag down a waiter again, and explain that this isn't what we ordered. Only once again to not get our food for awhile. During this, the line of guests waiting to be seated grew to at least 10 people, and no one was there to greet them.The food was mediocre, overpriced, and not worth the view.I'd recommend going up to Fabre point to see the city and the forests, but pack a lunch, because there's no point in eating here.",

Might be better for a (fairly expensive) family outing than a date.Food was pretty good - we had the cod with soba and the pasta with clams in white wine sauce. 3 stars for the quality and maybe a bit more for the large portions! We couldn't finish.Ambience was a 2.5-3 star though - tables and chairs were made from poolside plastic and kind of tacky for the prices and setting. Kind of a confusing place. Maybe I'd go for brunch instead.",

It was about 8:30pm, clear evening skies with the view of the city and the cable cars running.We had a rose wine and a mocktail, both of which were tasty. We shared a seafood pasta, which was good, but not the best. Taste was a bit on the bland side, but it was just one dish.Next time I'm in SG I would definitely come back. It's a great, casual, romantic spot for a date.",

The food is slightly pricier than Faber Bistro, which is opposite, but more variety available. I always order their Foie gras, and their steak is also great. Among the many times when I was there, their dish presentation had never been the same - maybe their creative way of trying not to bore returning customers. Tip: call early to reserve tables that have the best view.",
