The food was cheap. Everything tastes nice! I exceptionally love the rose drink (I forgot what it's called) and satay! The ambiance is made more festive as the sun sets and the lights are turned on. It's near hotels, attractions and bus station so very accessible. People should really come here.",

I went solo but met a few groups due to the table shortage, most notably a Filipino nightclub performer and his girlfriend who insisted I try the squid and palabka(sp?). \u00a0Glad I went and would go back for more.",

There are a lot of food options because there are multiple stands with a variety of different foods, so you're not only limited to one thing. Seating is kind of difficult, however. We went a couple of times around dinnertime and it took us close to 20 minutes to find a table each time. \u00a0We went for dessert once and it was pretty easy to grab a table since it was later in the evening. You basically have to walk around and catch people as they're leaving. Once they get up, you stand next to the table and wave the busboy down to have them clear up the plates.Oh, the food! Since we went here a few times during our stay in Singapore, we managed to eat quite a few dishes. \u00a0We had the chili crabs, fried carrot cake, (those two were my favorites), satay, chicken rice, duck rice, and ice kacang (it's like snow cone) for dessert. We had a few other things, but I can't think of the names of it, but this is an amazing place to eat. Check it out if you're in Singapore.",

Below averageThe salted egg yolk fries idea is not new. However they made the fries so fat and the taste so average that it became a disappointment.The Mutarbak is really very average. I didn't know what else to say.The Cuttlefish is the only dish that deserves a repeat order. The satay person is interesting. He was trying to convince our friend that the satays are very good. Our friend lives in HK and probably looks and smells like a tourist. Mr satay-man refuses to give up until one of us says we are all local. He was disappointed but we gave him some order. When the satay came he gave us a $2 discount! $18 for 20 satay and we paid $16. And what about the 26 cups of sugarcane? We were thirsty. Very thirsty.",

Not being a stranger to Singapore (but still not having been to Makansutra beforehand), we were frustrated that while the options were varied, the food stalls ran out of food too quickly. We arrived a little before 10pm, and we couldn't even read the menu options before whoever was manning the satay stand blurted out that there was no more satay. How does the satay stall run out of satay over three hours before the food court closes? I could understand running out maybe 30 minutes before closing or something, but not three whole hours. And that happened with a few other stalls as well. Ultimately, more options we wanted were unavailable than those that were available. That just smacks of food service mismanagement, unfortunately.We left by 1045, after being frustrated that not only was the satay gone, but so were the coconut drinks, as well as most of the desserts. Actually, everything was out from the dessert stall (like durian ice and banana tempura), and the only thing there was mediocre kaya toast. While the view on the water is very nice and the vibe is younger than at most food courts, I wouldn't recommend Makansutra in light of the myriad great food options in Singapore.",

    "text": "Makansutra, known for it's famous local delights, and the food stalls, I heard, were specially chosen for tourists and Singaporeans to taste the best of our local food. I'm not too sure why the low ratings from other reviewers, but I have to agree with most of them that the standard has dropped since its opening and the food there isn't that cheap too.Here are some of my recommendations if you're there. I have to say, not all stalls are good, but these few are really worth the try.Fried Carrot Cake (White). You have to try this. It's one of my favourite Fried Carrot Cake I've tasted. Get the white one instead of the black carrot cake. Oh yes, if the old uncle is the chef of the night, you're in for some really yummy Carrot Cake!Calamansi drink. There's something special in this drink, perhaps is the plum they add to their drinks. It's awesome. I can drink two cups in one night when I'm really thirsty.Chicken wings. Go get that! If you're a chilli lover, please, please ask for more chilli! It's spicy but really goes very well with the chicken wings. My friends and I love it.These are some of my recommendations that was worth the 4 stars ratings I gave. The rest of the food are okay, not too bad but nothing special either.",

    "text": "When two of our friends from Dubai paid us a visit here in Singapore, we mapped out an all-the-way Singaporean themed tour. Ofcourse, food is no exception. My friend recommended me the Makansutra Gluttons Bay. Seeing the place for the first time, it has this celebratory vibe. Maybe it has something to do that it's much alive at night, with round tables fitting 8 people with beer and their choice of meals.Honestly, it's nothing different compared to a typical hawker center found everywhere across the country. It just so happens that this is in proximity with the tourist spots namely the Esplanade, the Merlion and the Marina Bay Sands. Serving wise, we were more than happy. Taste wise, it was delicious but like I said, I can easily go to a hawker center and order some grilled squid, fried rice, and some sticks of satay. Price wise, it's very tourist-ty.This is probably one of the places you can visit occassionally, especially if you have guests. But given that the area is small and the number of tourists that frequent that area, might as well have the meals take away and eat it at home.",

Maybe a dollar or two more expensive than a neighbourhood food centre but I think the ease of ordering such a wide selection in a small place, plus the location close to the water, is worth the extra buck. This also beats any of the mall food-courts I've visited. The chicken rice was only average, but I did enjoy the kway teow and the satay. The hokkien mee was not bad. Once again, I emphasise the ease of ordering and sampling a variety of singaporean favourites in one place. It was well lit when we were there, and well-populated with locals so it can't be all bad!! I would go back with any of our visitors scheduled to come through this year.",

I wish I could make a big sign to tell them where else to go.I was going to a show at the Esplanade last week, and had 20 minutes to get food, and made the sad mistake of giving Gluttons Bay a go. The Chai Tau Kuay was chai-por and therefore tasteless, despite an overwhelming overcompensation in the egg department. The hokkien mee was worse. Looked out, but tasted like noodles boiled in water. Where'd the prawn stock go?The sugar cane tasted all right, but that can't be enough to save a hawker centre, can it?",

Singaporeans will walk past Gluttons Bay whispering amongst ourselves that authentic hawker fare tastes better and costs cheaper.The exception is when it's late at night and you're caught in town. Where else to eat? This is where Gluttons Bay is \"not-bad\" for a group of friends to sit down and relieve their hunger pangs. I did just that and tried a number of dishes.The satay and fried carrot cake were disappointing; better versions could be easily found elsewhere. I also requested from the Indian uncle a plate of maggie goreng - a classic that brings me back to school days. It was reasonable, pretty savoury, though a tad too oily and lacking in ingredients for me.The saving grace was the environment. The cooling breeze, the moonlit sky, lovely friends - all ingredients for a relaxing weekend night. But then again, I could have gotten the same thing sitting anywhere else.",

The crabs in Singapore that they use for these dishes are the Sri Lanka crabs which resembles a Dungeness crab but more sweet and firm!The satay was amazing! Don't forget to get a refreshing Tiger beer with your meal and pack wet wipes for your hands! You're going to need it!CHEERS!",

Things are either too bland, too salty, too sweet (the Chili crab...), or lacking that unique wok-hei taste that makes or breaks most of our noodle dishes. Yes, while it's not always easy to find good hawker food, you'd expect something at least of a reasonable standard for somewhere that's often visited by people who want an idea of what \"Singapore food\" is like. At least the location is good, close to nearby attractions that tourists may want to visit. But, would definitely recommend somewhere else for a better local food experience.

    "text": "With no more than ten vendors, Makansutra Gluttons Bay is one of the smaller hawker centers in Singapore. Food variety is more limited here, so choices aren't overwhelming. It gets very crowded around 7pm, so finding a seat may be challenging. And because it's adjacent to Marina Bay and a few shopping centers, it's very touristy.There was quite a plethora of food shared among three adults: steamed conch, BBQ sambal stingray, gai lan, shrimp hokkien mee, beef and chicken satay, and tahu goreng. For me, the satay and the stingray struck me as the most delicious and interesting, respectively.The beef and chicken satay were delicious and smokey with very tender and moist meat. The complementing dipping sauce for the satay wasn't necessary, but it added extra tangy and sweet flavors. The BBQ sambal stingray was peculiar and a little difficult to eat while trying to neatly remove the flesh away from the bones, but the generous slather of spicy sambal paste was flavorful.Overall, I was more than satisfied with the food and environment. Situated next to Marina Bay, Makansutra provides a mild breeze from the bay with beautiful waterfront views. The location is perfect for a gluttonous dinner and then a stroll along the waterfront afterwards. And this hawker center is open from 5pm until as late as 3am in the morning! I can understand why some people are disappointed with the small size and limited variety here at Makansutra, but my motto is less is more. Too many options tend to be overwhelming in my book.",

Again, there aren't a ton of choices to eat, but you'll want to spend some time looking at all of the food choices available to you.First night:Combo G satay platter: can't remember the name, but it was near the fruit juice place at one end of the stalls. You get big pieces of shrimp, along with chicken, beef, lamb, etc. for 28 SGDChili crab: we ordered these at the other end of the stalls, and it was really good. For 490 SGD, we got two crabs smothered in a really good chili sauce (not too spicy). You must get the Mantou buns as well (lightly fried pieces of dough) to sop up all of the sauce.Samba sting ray: same stall as the chili crab place. This dish was really good, not too spicy, but after eating the satay and the crab, we were too stuffed to finish this.Second night:Grilled chicken wings: nice and smokeySalted egg crab and black pepper crab: we already had the chili crab the previous night, so we went to another stall and got two other crab preparations. It was 70 SGD for these two, but they gave us a lot of Mantou buns for free. Both versions were tasty as well, but I liked the chili crab version the best.Coming here at night, finding a table next to the water, and eating crab: I don't think that it can get any better than this. As with everywhere else, bring your own napkins ( I didn't see a hand washing station here).",

    "text": "Great range of specialties here with good options which are very affordable.Fab views over Marina Bay and lots of seating for grabbing your food for eating on site.Open late till 1am - we were there chatting whilst munching food till nearly 3am so a good late night spot which is uncommon in Singapore. Getting here early will give you more options. We didn't arrive till just before midnight due to working late and by that point, many vendors had sold out.Beer and soft drinks are available / a tiger beer can is $5 sing and the lime juice (first stall as you arrive) is $3.50 sing and is a really lovely balance of sweet and tanginess. I had eaten earlier but the guys got the local chicken and rice dish, chicken satay, veggies and soup (all x2) and it cost them $10 sing each.Well worth a visit for a cheap feed with great views.",

    "text": "When I came to Singapore for the first time in 2015 this place was chosen by my colleagues from work on the first evening to introduce me to the variety of food in Singapore, and I was blown away.Everybody (excluding me) grabbed their favorite something and we ended with 10 people and 14 dishes and of course the appropriate amount of tiger beer. This was the time I saw the tiger tower for the first time, with the brilliant idea of the inner ice core to keep the beer cold.So I returned with the same bunch in 2016 on my second trip to find it closed for spring cleaning. This year in a next attempt we managed to find a table for 16 people which is rather tough in the evening. The food ( incl. pigs brain) was delicious again, some new dishes, and the fabulous view afterwards in you decide to walk around Marina bay. This is an absolute must \u00a0in Singapore and of course the more the merrier, so bring your friends and colleagues!",

    "text": "At first glance Gluttons Bay is just another \"tourist trap\", and some would liken it to another Newton Circus. In truth, I prefer Gluttons Bay a lot more than Newton Circus, and would definitely recommend it to my tourist friends!The view here is fantastic, look out to Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade, and Fullerton Hotel. Open air dining, cool breeze and not too stuffy. What is there not to like? It is a great place to show off Singapore's pretty skyline to your tourist friends!In terms of price, I'd say it is pretty fair for eating in town. Definitely dont compare it to your local hawker centre/ coffee shop prices, but I do find the prices reasonable for the portions, quality and location.Food quality is pretty decent and fairly authentic too. How better to experience the best of Singapore's local cuisines. They may not be from the \"best\" hawker, but they are definitely authentic and good enough for tourists to get a good taste. I also like how the hawker stalls dont come around the harrass you to order from them (like in Newton Circus). Definitely recommended!",

    "text": "Good starter pack of food choices of what outdoor foodcourts of Singaporeans have to offer. They have a lot of choices and different vendors. Some really expensive, some really cheap. Just be cautious and be sure your pallet can handle whatever you buy. Seat hunting is hell, be prepared to actively look for seating. If it doesnt work out, bring your plate out to the benches of the waterfront and enjoy the view. Just be sure to bring back the dishes.The food is average. The experience is amazing. Hit this place at least once to get a feel for this city in its \"somewhat\" facade.",

    "text": "It's too easy to hate on Makansutra Gluttons Bay and write it off as a tourist trap with the same intensity that San Franciscans decry Fisherman's Wharf. It honestly isn't that bad, and on a cool breezy night, is worth the visit if anything just for Singapore hawker food under the stars with a view of Marina Bay Sands and the nightly laser light show. Now the food isn't amazing but isn't horrible either. Curated by Makansutra, I won't be surprised if there is some kick-back for KF Seetoh since there were some odd choices for the stalls. For example I don''t think Filipino food is an accurate representation of Singaporean hawker food if you were forced to narrow it down to 10 stalls; maybe the evolution of hawker food, but definitely not an epitome of it. Still the paradox of choice is minimized here and you can focus on just a couple of stalls. I had the char kuay teow and ngo hiang (a disappearing hawker dish in itself) and they were both decent. You probably find better elsewhere in the city but we weren't complaining. Other stalls that looked appealing included the bbq seafood and the satay. Both stalls have longer lines though. Prices weren't painfully higher and again, you do get a nice view. It can get humid so cross your fingers for a crosswind",

It's a good place to get food post-performance at Esplanade as its open later than the restaurants in the area. Though a bit popular with tourists, the food is solid. I have tried carrot cake, fresh juice, char kway teow from here and all have been pretty good too. Centrally located and fairly easy to get to, it's a nice pit stop but can get pretty crowded.",

    "text": "This review is basically for the Sweet Spot stall, and the fourth star is for them being open when I needed them (yes, it is possible to *need* dessert).As a white American with limited knowledge of Chinese New Year, you might think that Chinese New Year is a fun and festive time to visit Singapore. And you'd be right. You may end up catching a midnight fireworks show, or visiting the Float (along with seemingly every other human on the island) to see the amazing lantern display there. BUT you may also find yourself realizing that pretty much all of the places you bookmarked on Yelp are closed for the holiday. I desperately wanted to try an ice kacang but time on my trip was running out. Fortunately, on our last night there, we passed the Makansutra stalls. At this point, I was not optimistic but at the far end we found the Sweet Spot. VICTORY WAS MINE.I ordered an ice kacang without durian and my boyfriend ordered a lychee dessert. Based on the size, we probably should have shared. The ice kacang was a fun treat with a variety of textures and colors: the grainy shaved ice saturated with bright rainbow syrup, the crunch of nuts, the sweet yellow corn, the smooth chewy jellies, and the tender beans all mingling together to keep your taste buds interested as you race against to the time and the heat to finish the mountain of teeth-rotting goodness before it becomes a muddy colored soup. I feel like more desserts should involve corn and beans. In summary, Makansutra \u00a0may mostly attract tourists and it may not be the best place in town, but I enjoyed my visit there.",
