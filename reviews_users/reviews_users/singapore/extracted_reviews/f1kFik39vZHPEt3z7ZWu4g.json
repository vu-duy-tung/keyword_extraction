    "text": "Aston's has long been one of my favourite haunts for cheap and good Western food. Unlike the usual restaurants nowadays, Astons does not charge taxes; or more accurately, counts taxes as part of their meal price beforehand. Whilst this is seen as a gimmick to some, to students like us this means that we are somehow less reluctant to part with our little money. Seating is usually quick and efficient after getting past the notorious queue at the entrance during peak hours which can sometimes go up to an hour long. But orders are taken at the door, so food is usually served promptly after being seated. The staff at the Cathay branch are young and fast, so that's another plus point right there. You get to order a main dish, and 2 sides from a set menu, so one portion is definitely more than enough to fill us up before a movie. The seating booths at the restaurant also offer lots of privacy for patrons; which is another reason why I rate this joint as a great place to dine with friends - no creepy eavesdropping going on here!",

Food was not bad, service was okay too. But I just don't understand why we can't have another order at our seated place from one of the staff whereas we have to go back to queue and order from the counter again. That's so much a waste of time and people are hungry. Seriously?",

    "text": "I have visited Aston's a few times now. I was curious because there were always a long queue in most of their outlets. So one day my family and I decided to try Aston's for the 1st time. I was quite impressed with Aston's initially. Ok food but at a very reasonable price, service, \u00a0and big portion too. It's value for money, so I wouldn't be too fussy about the quality. But my latest visit changed all that.Seriously don't expect prime cut if you order steak. Doneness is a little out for my medium rare request a few times. Ribs were a little too dry for liking. Bolognese has generous quantity of beef, but I find them a little dry and lack favor. Mind you, the bolognese only cost less than $10. Hey in additional, where can you find a descent steak for under $25 with 2 side dishes in a restaurant setting in Singapore? So I wouldn't mind going back to Aston's for a pretty descent meal at a very affordable price.In service industry I can tolerate bad service. I don't expect the service to be consistent and have different expectation on the level of service based on the price I pay. But I cannot tolerate staff(s) who are rude to customers. No one deserve and should tolerate rude staff. On this day, I was ordering food at the cashier. The service staff's body was \"shaking\" all the while when we were talking. Ha, he was standing on one leg and shaking the other. It's kind of distracting and already leaving a bad impression. What was next is a little fuel to the fire. We always get a one or two words answer! \"Yes\", \"No\", \"One\", \"Two\"..... This is all we can get the service staff to say during our conversation. What happened next is the Tipping Point! We asked \"can we know what we have ordered for our side dishes?\" The staff simple pick up the receipt he had just printed out....., cliped the receipt on the clip board......, and pass the clip board to us without saying a word...... Then I asked \"what is this?\" He replied \"is on the receipt\"... 4 precious words! 2 more incidents during this visit. 1st our request for addtional plate was not met. 2nd the chicken was not really cooked. Only a small portion, so I ate it anyway. But the attitude of the staff is what changed our opinion of this restaurant.Well the staff just took less than 5mins to destroy the reputation of a restaurant who otherwise would scored a 3-4 stars ranking in my opinion. Would I recommend the restaurant? Yes, for value of money no-frill food. Would I go back again? Yes, but there are better ones out there, so they are out of my preference circle.",

    "text": "Been here three times before I decided to give a review on this business. Came here with different groups of friends too and had different food each time round. The first time I tried was the steak (forgot which one I had). Wasn't great. The sides, I had mashed potatoes and onion rings. I prefer the mashed potatoes.The second time I had Honey Bourbon Ribs with mac & cheese and baked potato. The ribs was quite good. The sauce was flavorful. The portion was considered big too and I had to share with another person. The mac & cheese was quite good. It has melted cheese that makes one yearn to eat more of it after one spoonful. The third time, I had lemon lime chicken with 2 sides of french fries. Was in the mood for fries. The fries was good and it had sprinkles of spices. It seemed like they are cooked awhile ago as it wasn't crunchy. Would prefer it to be freshly cooked. The chicken was also bright pink in color when I received it. I wonder whether it was edible but ate it anyways. Sauce wise it was flavorful. You can dip the fries to the sauce to give you a better bursting flavor.Beverages, I've tried ice lemon tea and root beer. Was normal I guess. Too much ice though.Waitress came to serve us pretty good timing and the cashier person served us promptly (according to the queue). But sometimes she might rush you when you are ordering your food. Yes, price here is reasonable. But for quality food, I prefer the one at ARC. Will only visit when friends ask me to eat there.",

My goodness, the friend onions are the best: crunchy and greasy - perfect for a burger!Admittedly, Aston's ingredients may not be the most fancy, nor is the chain extremely consistent in its food executions. However, it is definitely value for money. Keep up the good work, and please revamp that ieat super burger as Dr.Tay has requested!",

There are many waiters, but the service is still not attentive enough. Also, one needs to pay at the cashier, which is not very convenient during busy hours!BAD: - There is NO WiFi for customers!

    "text": "Got $10 left in your wallet and you want a filling meal with no GST included? Well Aston's Specialties is the place for you! Order any main course and you get to pick two sides from fries to salads. I usually opt for their chicken or their grilled fish with potato salad and pasta salad. If you ask me, their chicken is better than their grilled fish as the fish is a bit too salty for my liking (this is from the many times I ordered fish from them). As for the chicken sauce.. from BBQ to teriyaki.. to be honest, it tastes the same to me as both sauces are quite sweet.. other than that, it's quite affordable and what you pay for is what you get for the quality of the food. Quantity wise, it's quite enough!The only downside is the queue.. if you go at 6-8pm you can look forward to waiting for quite a while to getting a seat. Also, they do not do reservations. So be warned!",

    "text": "Probably the most popular Astons after it's first stall at East Coast, this outlet at Cathay has raving reviews and a perpetually long queue. Having been there several times, the wait time has never decreased over the past year. It has been a consistent 15 minutes of wait!My favorite dish coming in at $18 is the double chicken that gives you 2 pieces of grilled chicken thigh with any of the sauces stated. Looking closer, that means that that is double the meal without doubling the cost! Each dish comes with a side and my favorite of Astons is their baked skin-on potato. Drinks are a bit expensive in Astons and I would try to avoid it if possible.I would like to commend the service of this branch as they noted the long waiting time and allowed my friend to order a drink while queuing. And finally when the wait was too long and he had to rush off, they actually waived off this charge in recognition that they had too long a wait time. Of course, the rest of us stayed because we were impressed with the service. This is actually one of the restaurants that actually showed good initiative in service and I'm really impressed.",

The queue is rather long with many teenagers frequenting the restaurant, but it also moves fast due to the quick service. It is not a place to stay and chat with your friends though as it is quite noisy and hectic in side.At $7.90 for an average main course and 2 side dishes, such as the black pepper chicken and crispy fried chicken, it is a great value for money. I usually have the chargrill chicken or black pepper chicken as I'm not too fond of the sweetness of the bbq chicken and teriyaki chicken. For sides, the tasty rice has been good and bad on different days, but the potato salad and mashed potatoes are rather safe options.",

There's nothing that special about the ribs but its good because its simple and tasty. 24 bucks for a full slap of ribs is quite good value.The only down side about this outlet is that the queues can get INSANELY long and the seating area is a little bit squeezy.",
