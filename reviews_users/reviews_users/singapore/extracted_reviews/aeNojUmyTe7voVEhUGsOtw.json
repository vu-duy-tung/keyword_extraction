    "text": "We love wings and therefore we love Hooters. However, this Hooters is such a let down. We try to visit a Hooters in each country we visit, we've been to a few across the USA and we've been to one in Japan. We were excited to see there was one in Singapore...Our food was fine. My cocktail was $13.90 and wasn't even filled to the top of the glass and didn't taste quite right... the service was average. There were no quirky Hooter wet wipes (moist towelettes) with sayings on them. Oh and water - I asked for some water for the table and was told they didn't do any, and that I had to pay for it. Where is the responsible service of alcohol? I paid for a bottle, but that seems irresponsible when you are selling 2L beer towers, cocktails and other alcoholic beverages. The free wifi had a weak signal and apps wouldn't load quickly or stay connected. Our meal came to $71.70. It was over priced for average food and below average service. When we went to pay, the girl looked at us continued what she was doing and then left the counter. She came back, we got our bill and paid for it, (no how was your meal? Or any other general chatter or conversation) and then she walked away. I waiting for my change. We weren't sure if she was coming back or if she thought it was a tip. After awhile she came back and handed our change to us and walked off. I'd recommend spending your money else where along Clark Quay, there's many other places.",

The setup here was similar to any other Hooters with seating for 100 plus. We were greeted right away and was told I could sit wherever I liked. After choosing a table menus were brought over. I decided on the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, my friend decided on 10 chicken wings with 5 of them being medium heat and the other 5 being 911 (the hottest they have).The fries arrived first, they were just okay. My Buffalo Chicken Sandwich arrived next, the chicken itself was pretty good but it shouldn't be called Buffalo, there is no Buffalo sauce or an anything else on it for that matter. It comes with Baked Beans that tasted like they were right out of a can.My friends wings arrived next, they looked good so I tried one of the regular ones while she tried one of the 911's. I thought it was alright but that's about it, I asked my friend how she liked the wings and she said they were okay and that the 911's were not very spicy.The service was good and the place was clean but the food was sub-par.",

To celebrate being an American in Singapore, I decided to make a beeline from the Ministry of Manpower to one of Singapore's \"American concept restaurants\"- Hooters. BECAUSE I'M AWESOME LIKE THAT ERMAGERD DON'T JUDGE ME.This Hooters is very well situated in Clarke Quay, and is probably tourist infested at night. Lunch in the middle of the week is pretty quiet, though. I looked through their lunch specials but I just thought they were weird. I know they have to cater to the local crowd, but a part of me thinks it's strange to order prawn spaghetti from Hooters, of all places. But if you like that stuff, you're in luck, as $10 will get you an entree, soft drink and ice cream. And if you want beer with that, it will only be an extra $5!I was craving their wings so I ordered 10 of 'em. Still as good as I remembered it. And to remind myself I'm in Singapore, I made sure to have a Tiger beer to go along with it.The girls are cute, all Asian (of course) and none of them have muffin tops. So that's cool.Hooters SG, you're a-ok in my book. :)",

So many times I have walked past Hooters at Clark Quay, and each time its the same slightly sleazy and uncomfortable impression that we get from the voluptuous ladies wearing neon orange hot pants. But a friend who is one of the most demure people I know told me to give the fried pickles a try, so I finally did once as a before-beer-snack. HOOKED. Perfectly hot salty and crispy bite-sized pieces, with a juicy sliced pickle encased inside. There isn't any tangy taste like those we scrape out from our cheeseburgers, but there is still the unmistakable pickled cucumber taste. Goes perfect with an Erdinger and soccer on the TVs! Many happy and contented night has since been spent at Hooters with the boyfriend cheering for our team. Do try their Buffalo Wings too! Comes in a range of spiciness levels, but we recommend the Hot. Just don't inhale too close to the fumes, they add vinegar to the batter sauce - a potent mix!",

People gave me the looks they reserve for smelly hobos on trains, but hey. These were Hooters wings we're talking about.Post consumption of wings, I was a little non-plussed. Them wings were wayyyy better in those US stores; perhaps I had brought home unrealistic (inflated?) expectations - I'd remembered seeing Hooters differently. Maybe the beer goggles helped.",

We had the lunch promotion with additional top up with S$2+ to get a tea/coffee and ice cream. Another non local girl served us, who is wearing a white tshirt with jeans, was a tad unfriendly with a little attitude. As she served our ice cream, one of the cup slip and the ice cream fall on the tray. She pick it up and put a side. Then we told her we want the ice cream to be take-away. She then left the ice cream at the counter outside the outdoor (as we were seated outside) and went to the kitchen to pick up the container. Then when she came out, I approach her and asked if she is changing the ice cream since was it fell on the tray, she replied \"THE TRAY IS CLEAN\". And I said, yes but it fall on the tray and it is unhygienic. She kept repeating \"but the tray is CLEAN\". I demand her to change 3x before she bring the ice cream into the kitchen unwillingly. First of all, she left the ice cream outdoor and went to the kitchen to pick up the container and intend to put our ice cream into the container outside is already not so right. The ice cream is melting outside while she takes her time to the kitchen and come back. 2nd she accidentally drop the ice cream, the tray may be clean, but shouldn't she change a new one since it was her fault? And how we know how clean is the tray? Excuse me, we pay for the service charge, is the way how the food should be treated?",

We were greeted by waitresses in low cut tops and short shorts (hence its name). They were surprisingly rude and snappy and according to my guy friends (not very hooter material).We got chicken wings, curly fries and fried pickles to share. The chicken wings are their specialty but they were nothing spectacular. They were tasty but there was no punch to it that made any of us go \"wow\". Their curly fries were not great either, and you can probably get the same thing frozen from the supermarket. Their fried pickles, however were pretty awesome! Its surprisingly addictive and was not as sour as I thought it would be. Overall, the food and service there is not great but if you happen to drop by hooters, do not miss out on their fried pickles!",

Hooter's wings are deep fried and lathered with a tangy buffalo sauce. You can get blue cheese dressing (my favourite) as your dip. It's pretty pricey for such wings but sometimes when you have the kind of craving that makes the corners of your mouth sweat for some spicy tangy buffalo wings, you can't go wrong with hooter's.They have set lunches that go from as low as $10 for a main course, drink and a scoop of ice-cream. But having lunch here is a vastly different ambience from having dinner in the evening. It's quieter and much less crowded, all the more to enjoy your food!",
