This was the star dish of our table. With air conditioning, this is a nicer environment to relax and enjoy the chicken rice compared to the open air hawker stalls which also have great food offerings. Indoor restaurant standard by which other chicken rice indoor vendors should be compared.",

    "text": "This place is serious about chicken rice. The wait can be long but don't let that stop you from checking this place out. My party of five had waited about an hour in line on a Saturday night and needless to say our stomach was growling. Luckily we knew what we wanted and quickly placed our orders right after we were seated. The lime juice was perfectly tangy and refreshing on a hot summer night. We started off with the thick soup with dried scallop, crab meat, and sweet corn (slightly sweet and seafood flavors), the deep fried bean curd with Thai style sauce (super smooth tofu and evenly fried exterior), and fried long bean with beancurd cube, nuts and minced pork (loved the salty and nutty flavor). The signature boiled chicken was of course the main event and the most prized dish on our table. The boneless chicken was amazingly smooth and could have done without any sauce or dressing because that's how tasty it was by itself. We also had the braised Chinese cabbage and the vegetables in sambal sauce, which were as excellent. This was a great and satisfying meal for the entire table and I would be more than happy to return.",

    "text": "Before I traveled to Singapore, I did a little survey with my friends who had been there before to see which restaurant has the best Hainan Chicken. I got about 50/50 vote for Tian Tian and Boon Tong Kee. And I tried both - Boon Tong Kee won by miles.-) Hainan Chicken Rice: I was blown away by the taste of their chicken. It's super soft yet tender (hard to explain), super moist, and with strong \"chicken smell\" (meaning it doesn't have a \"frozen smell\" sometimes you may experience if the chicken isn't well prepared). You have to try it in person to understand how it felt. The rice, although it looks like regular steam rice, it has a strong chicken taste; not very moist but if you eat with the chicken it will be the best combination.-) \u00a0(\u99ac\u62c9\u76de) Belacan Vege: another great dish. The chef cooked it very well; fresh vege and nice smell similar to shrimp paste. Very good to go with rice.-) Coffee Ribs: I heard it is a famous cooking method although it was the first time I tried. Very unique; it does have a strong coffee smell. Personally I like coffee a lot so this dish was another wonderful one.-) Crab Meat Fish Stomach Soup: pretty amazing again; a lot of crab meat and fish stomach, the soup itself can make you full. Well cooked.Definitely Boon Tong Kee is the restaurant I look forward to the most when I go Singapore again. It is a chain store with 4-5 restaurants; did a bit of map research and this location is probably the easiest accessible one for tourists staying in downtown. Right next to subway station, and Singapore Subway map is pretty self-explanatory too.I can't wait to go again!",

You can get their chilli to go in a glass bottle for $3.50. Expires in a year.",

    "text": "One of the best Hainanese chicken rice that I have ever had at Singapore. The restaurant is very crowded, but the service is friendly. +++ Chicken rice: The chicken meat is amazingly moist, tender and tasty. The chicken skin looks semi transparent with a layer of chicken broth jelly. The chicken rice that goes with it has this bold tasty flavor. The rice is not very moist for me, but it's tasty. It's an excellent dish. +++ Fish filet: The fish is fresh and crispy. \u00a0The sauce that goes with the fish is tasty and fresh. Again, there is spiciness in the sauce, yet you can still taste every single herbs and the freshness of the fish in the dish. +++Coffee pork ribs: The pork ribs were crispy and tasty. The coffee aroma woke up all your senses. \u00a0+++ Fried bean curd: It was an amazing simple dish. The bean curd was medium firm, the flour coat was crispy, but the bean curd melt in your mouth when you take the first bite. You can almost taste the tofu maker get up in the midnight and he/she put the soaked soy bean into the grinder, \u00a0followed by broiling and straining dry the beans. That's how fresh it is. +++ Seafood spinach: \u00a0The seafood broth is thick, fresh and sweet. It goes perfectly with fresh greens. Mr. Q and I were surprised by the most traditional Singapore food here, the dishes were tasty, but yet it didn't make you feel thirsty at all. If you have a short Singapore trip, but you still want to try the best local Hainanese chicken. Save your time searching, this is the place. I highly recommend this place to all my Yelpers.",

The food comes out in 2 minutes flat so you know the chef's working some magic back in the kitchen. Literally record setting efficiency if you think about it. They also bring you the check with the food, which is another testament to their efficiency. The proactive service is convenient because at this point in the meal you should probably pay and just walk the 50 feet to the nearest McDonalds and order a quarter pounder with cheese. All in all great dining experience.",

    "text": "Boon Tong Kee and Tian Tian tops my list as the two places to go to when I want the best Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore. The flavor of their chickens and chili sauces are very similar, but their rice differs quite greatly. Boon Tong Kee's rice tends to be milder in flavor, and therefore not as oily or salty. So in the end, it's all about your preference.This particular location is located right by the MRT station and of the typical size. We had to wait a few minutes for a table even though it was after the lunch rush on a weekday. Surprisingly, our hostess was very courteous and everyone we dealt with afterwards were also gracious. This is surprising to me as in all my years living and visiting Singapore, I can count the # of good service I've gotten with just my two hands.In addition to the Hainanese Chicken Rice, we also ordered the Fried Tofu, which was one of the best fried tofus I've ever had in my life. The tofu was perfectly soft on the inside while the \"crust\" was golden brown and crispy. And with the sauce that they provide, it's practically heaven.If you could only have Chicken Rice once in Singapore and a Boon Tong Kee is the most convenient, you can be assured that you are getting a good representation of the unofficial national dish.",
