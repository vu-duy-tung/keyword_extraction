    "text": "Prior to moving to Singapore I have been living in the US and have been spoiled with Mexican food from my frequent trips to Cali and Mexico. Therefore when I heard a new Mexican place was opened in town, I was excited to try it out. My experience at Super Loco was a big disappointment. While the place is nice and trendy, the food is really what I cared about. The moment we sat down, my friend and I proceeded to order some drinks and chips and guac. She ordered a horchata and it just tasted someone dumped a whole bunch of cinnamon powder into the glass. My friend sent it back (after explaining how to make it) and they ended up adding a bunch of milk and when we commented it was not right- the waitress came back and told us the bartender said he didn't know how to make it and will make another drink instead. Really?? The chips and guac came- the chips were stale and the guac was a liquid mess. We ordered enchiladas and it came out soggy and was tasteless. None of the taste blended in together and nothing was flavorful. We also ordered a taco but even now as I'm writing this review, I cant even remember what kind of taco we ordered. The entire meal was unsatisfying and unmemorable. To top of it off, when we got the bill they decided to charge us 3x for the drinks. While we were arguing the bill (and managed to get them to change it) we noticed other tables complaining to the staff as well, especially one guy who was complaining loudly to the manager about the service.",

    "text": "I didn't go into this place expecting super authentic Mexican I mean after all it's called super loco and it's in a super touristy area in Singapore. So perhaps adjusting expectations before going helps the experience. We went during happy hour for $9 frozen margaritas and these were strong enough. I prefer margaritas on the rocks but not available for happy hour. Advised that the dishes were meant for sharing family style so for 8 of us we got 4 dishes and chips and salsa. In America each dish woulda been a portion for one but that is bc we are fat Americans. It was plenty of food and it actually tasted really good. Had the chicken enchiladas and the steak both of which were flavorful. The salsa that came with the chips isn't really my favorite kind - more smoky rather than fresh but went nicely with the drinks. The setting is fun and it didn't rain and their fans are powerful enough to feel like a cooling night breeze. Overall attentive service and a fun night to hang with other friends who had to leave for the airport early. I certainly wouldn't have chosen to go here just bc the name but my friends did and I'm glad we did. I think the dishes were expensive - like high 20s to low 30s but I'm getting used to these types of prices. I suppose it's about the same for tourists that end up hanging around Times Square. I mean what else do u expect but jacked up prices and mediocre food? So when I get pretty decent food like I did here I'll just be happy and not sweat the high prices.",

Might as well walk over to Clark quay and get your Mexican food there.Additionally I just came here for breakfast and wanted to order the breakfast burrito... I asked to have the black beans on the side....not the most egregious of requests....but they could not do it. The server (very nice by the way) explained that it was already in the burrito and could not be taken out. Which made me question...am I ordering a pre made burrito??? For $19? What am I paying for? I should just go to 7 eleven. It's was the strangest thing .",

If I wanted a 30 dollar tortilla chip with garbanzo beans and anise slathered on it, I would have gone to a 5 star restaurant. We wanted to shake salt over out entire table's orders for lack of flavor. The drink... 2 sips of the 17$ Margarita and it was gone. Great if you are a sugar ant.",

    "text": "I agree with previous reviews, the portions are so small and expensive. A single taco is $11. Nothing about the taco justifies that price. It's small (six inches) and basic. The garnishing is simply shredded cabbage and some sauce, the cheapest fixings possible. There's no sight of any kind of onion or tomatoes.That said, the grilled corn sprinkled with cheese is really good. I don't remember the price of that item, but that's probably why I liked it so much.The margarita jug is a rip off. It's not a jug, it's a slim carafe. $59 for six short glasses. Yes, that's cheaper than if you ordered six separate margaritas, but barely.The servers are nice. Okay, you get one point there.",

    "text": "DINNER: - tacos al pastor ($13)- quesadilla de Pollo ($16)- gingerale ($7)FOOD: The food is a deserving 3/5, as both dishes were very well seasoned. The tacos are served on single tortillas with a small portion of al pastor, couple pieces of grilled pinapple, and salsa Verde. Each taco is a couple bites. The only issue with the dish was the overcooked meat, which tells me they don't prepare the al pastor on a revolving spicket as its traditionally done. It had ok flavor, but was dry and tough. Quesadilla was average at best, and lacked cheese. No stringy, oozey, goodness here. Food is better here than at their sister restaurant, Lucha Loco.AMBIANCE: Decoration is well done. Comfortable, relatable, but elevated enough to host a date or set group dinner. It has the markings of a Baja taqueria without actually putting you there. I only wish it were a bit brighter. I sat inside, and found it hard to see what I was eating. Probably not an issue if seated outside. PRICE: It's expensive for dinner, because the portions are so small. My bill for one totaled $37.50 and I could've eaten a couple more tacos ($11-$16 each). OVERALL: Come for drinks + late night eats. It's not a bad place to visit, and could be very fun. Stop by with a group later in the evening to grab drinks and share a few small dishes.",

Either on the quality per dollar or quantity per dollar ratio or both.Super loco is unbelievably expensive.There is a dearth of Mexican options in Singapore and they are milking the expat pocket for what it's worth. I especially disliked how the \"tequila cart\" came round and the servers \"didn't know how much each shot costs\" yet pressured my whole table into buying them. It sounds silly but you'll understand when you're there. It was $16 each, which is Pangaea type pricing while drinking said shot next to a kid watching Aladdin on his iPad. The food portions, as with lucha loco, are pathetically small. You could eat better and be full at other super atas street food joints like Ippudo down the road. Unless you are craving tacos epicly like I was craving chwee kuay in the middle of Virginia, or your boss paid you a really good bonus and Hermes ran out of Birkins for you to buy, skip Super Loco.",

Perhaps taking note of the previous feedback, the service we we experienced was extremely fast, and their staff were friendly. Food was pretty good! My favorite dish by far was the blue crab tostaditas! Price point is definitely on the higher end, probably because of the location as well. With that said, I think a lot of people on yelp are complaining because they're not used to paying for a single taco (I've been to a few restaurants that charge by per taco overseas). The only disappointing thing, for me, was dessert. Their churros were a little bit overdone, and my husband didn't really like the rice icecream.",

Looked at the menu and ordered two beef and two Chicken.Plus ordered a side of chips and guacamole dip.Well normal Mexican food restaurants don't usually charge separate for a small helping of chips, and charge for salsa. But this place does. Since the salsa and Guacamole were the same price I went for the Guacamole $5 Singapore dollars and $5 Singapore dollars for the small bowl of chips.I also ordered a margarita.Well I got the bland chips and the blandest guacamole ever. Was really expecting more flavor. My tacos were then brought to me and there was not a shred of cheese on them. But the instead put red cabbage. Well I tried the beef. It was a bland, watery mess. I was so disappointed. So then I asked again for my drink. It was brought out and to my surprise was just a nasty looking lemon slice on a glass of margarita on the rocks. Tasted it and was again disappointed. Well moved to the chicken taco, and Wow, disappointment number 4!!! Tastes like eating a paper taco with cabbage. No cilantro in sight. No spices, or hot sauces to add. Just a lot of money and a disappointed stomach. Asked for my check and left after paying S$10 for on beef taco and S$8 for the chicken. S$16 for the margarita, and S$10 for the chips and guacamole.The Resturant at least took off the two tacos I didn't eat. I highly discourage anyone eating here, unless you like high priced bland food...",

The concept of the place is great, but I'm sorry the food did not live up to the price they are asking for for each dish.The beginning of the meal was not too bad with the tostaditas - wishing they just made tostadas, that were regular sized instead of the topping too heavy for the tostadita.The tacos were not bad. The poblano taco needing a lot of help in the seasoning department. The lamb al pastor and the lengua tacos were not bad. The baja was quite flavourful.The churros to end our meal was a disappointment. It was more like a crispy biscuit. Yes they were crispy throughout. Was it overcooked? Overfried? Not sure but it was not doughy or chewy on the inside and we felt let down.I feel like this place is worth 2 stars only but I'll only take 2 stars off for food and value. I'm sorry that I can't recommend a place that charges 5 times more than what it's actually worth.",

Bad service when they're completely packed is understandable. I get it. But their wait staff were far more interested in closing up for the night (hours away) then serving the few customers that were remaining. This is INTENTIONALLY bad service, especially when you have an army of staff. This was a planned practice.",

I guess they know their audience well, since people keep packing the place in. Perhaps it's tourists or nearby residents who want tacos but can't be bothered to venture farther than 10 minutes to get decent kormex at Vatos. Save your time and money and go someplace else. Nothing on their menu tasted well, and I'm not even going to complain about the price. The food is bland and even the tortillas don't want to be there since they fall apart before even getting picked up off the plate. Sad. They have beer and creative cocktails, so that and the river location save them from a one star ranking.",

It has a very colorful look and design and it does look as if it is a fun place to hang out at. In a sense it is also as they serve some pretty decent Mexican food. We sampled several different tacos and they were all good but everything does however feel slightly like a rip off as prices are too high for what they are serving.I was also (like some other reviewers) asking for some changes to the dish but that was not possible which also seems to suggest they are perhaps not making the food (or that they are just unwilling to do much for their customers). Service was very disinterested as well, one of these places where the staff are more interested in talking to each other, checking their phones or fixing nails and/or make-up. We had to waive at people several times to be able to place an order and when finished it was the same thing trying to pay (and the place was not even half-full)So food was decent but over-priced and we did not really feel that welcome so will not return any time soon.",

    "text": "I am very wary of Mexican restaurants outside M\u00e9xico, since I've had so many dreadful experiences with horrible food labelled as \"Mexican\". My general rule is: if a restaurant has neon signs, cacti, sombreros, skulls, and a stereotypical name including words such as \"tequila\", \"amigo\", \"fiesta\", \"loco\", \"se\u00f1or\" or \"latino\", that is definitely a place to avoid. So, anyone could understand why I was reluctant to visit a place called \"Super Loco\".Reading the menu quickly dispelled my fears: no burritos, no nachos, no chimichangas, no fajitas, no chilli con carne, no \"taco meat\" (whatever that is). Instead, they have proper corn flour tortillas and also several welcome surprises with ingredients such as axiote, huitlacoche and pibil pulled pork. There is fairly good variety of tequila and mezcal, some very good brands included, and even explain the difference between tequila and mezcal. When it came to taste, Super Loco delivered. I had a huitlacoche quesadilla, with more mushrooms than huitlacoche but was still good. I also tried a red snapper taco which had a very nice touch of axiote, and a very nice mango ceviche. I was glad to have some of those nearly tasteless but fresh Mexican beers we like so much, rather overpriced. The only thing I did not like was the habanero sauce since it was, in fact, mayonnaise and that ruined the habanero taste. Overall, it was a good meal. It was also overpriced, though.The obvious question is if the place is \"truly\" Mexican, whatever that means. I could tell the owners are not Mexican, some slight misspellings on the menu gave them away. However, it is clear they have done their homework properly. The menu states they travelled to Mexico City and the Pacific Coast to do research on street food, and that explains Super Loco's good taste. It is a very good take on Mexican street food. It's true, maybe it's not exactly as it is in M\u00e9xico (purists sure will say that), but it has the proper essence. The fact that they don't stick lime wedges on your beer makes them more Mexican than many other joints I've visited elsewhere.",

A single Elote is enough to burn pockets. So order with caution! Prices aside, food was incredible. Flavours were spot on and service was great. Ambience was fun and vibrant. I'm a big fan of ceviche and man do I love their combinations. Their tortilla chips are super addictive and the hot sauces are so flavourful you hardly notice the spice. Elote was simply awesome and tacos were delicious. However the portions leave a lot to be desired. Remember to leave space for cocktails as they have a pretty extensive list. I understand that Super Loco is situated in an expat area and prices are suited to the clients there but I feel that for the amount of food they serve, the prices are unreasonable. Not for every dish but for most. I'd love to return as much as I can but the prices are simply far too high. Amazing food. High prices. Worth a try for a true Mexican food lover.",

This was a decent portion that two of us shared.Tortillas good (portions of two) but small so you need another couple to fill the gap. We ordered pork tortillas then little small (4) portion mini crab things which were tasty. Mexican was normally always a cheap meal but not so much here so be warned.

I admire her taste in furniture and her keen eye for decor. Her taste in music is top notch, as she bobs her head to club-like Tanjong Beach Club-esque tunes. And my, can she cook up a storm. For starters, her salsa is pretty good but her guac isn't as good as mine. (And I'm not saying that 'cause I'm jealous. I make a meaaaaan guac!) Her elotes (which is roasted corn smothered in sauce and sprinkled with cheese and chives) are probably one of the best snacks I've had in a while. I also loved one of her tuna appetizers, though I forgot what it's called. Although I'm an only child, I do understand that people hate it when you compare them to their sibling. But I gotta say that Senorita Super is just like her sister in the sense that she charges outrageous prices for a single taco.* However, I couldn't help but see if it was worth it at all. I ordered the one with chorizo, but was disappointed that it was more shredded meat than ground chorizo itself. So overall, I'm giving her a 3.5. Don't get me wrong, she's a cool friend and I'm thinking all my other friends will like hanging out with her, but she's just really high maintenance considering she enjoys the finer things in life. Maybe we'll just hang out once in a while over margaritas and elotes. --*That did not sound right but whatever leave me alone.",

    "text": "The day before I visited Super Loco I was told that it was currently the hottest thing in town. Digging around on the internet I found out it was run by a couple of Aussies who consulted chef Jason Jones (of Mamasita fame) on the menu. Being from Melbourne and having lined up at Mamasita on a number of occasions to eat tacos like every other hipster in town, I figured it was worth checking out.We arrived early (6pm) on a Saturday night and got a table right away. In the hour that followed the restaurant filled up with all sorts of groups - families out the front, dates on the the smaller tables and groups of friends gearing up for a big night on the larger high-topped tables at the back. The Margaritas were good, the salsa and chips were excellent though I baulked when I saw the meagre portion of guacamole that was served with them. We then ordered the famous Elotes, a Mamasita staple, which I declared would be the test for how well they had interpreted Jason Jones' menu. Flavour wise they were spot on - sweet, spicy, sour and salty but for some reason they were cold when we ate them as if they'd sat for far too long after being grilled. Perhaps this is an interpretation suited to the Singapore climate but I'm not sure it's for the better.The tuna things* were great, the chunks of fish generous and the dressing really well balanced. I'm sad they whisked the plate away before we could scoop up the slaw that they came sitting on. They would have been a nice addition to the top of them. *I can't remember what these were called!The Mexican truffle quesadilla were also terrific. Hot, melty with cheese and stuffed full of mushrooms. Compared with the tacos (ranging in price from $8 to $12!) they felt like one of the better value items. I tried the snapper taco. It was okay though at $8 I was kind of expecting the flavours to blow my mind. They didn't. While certainly not a cheep night out, a visit to Super Loco is a fun one. \u00a0Choose your menu items wisely and consider the cocktail jugs as a way to maximise your cash.",

(As Michelle M aptly put it)This is the new up and coming spot on Robertson Quay, decked in blinking neon, blaring music and similar lucha libre decor. The line is long even on a weekday. The menu is very close to the one at Lucha Loco, and so are the exorbitant prices. For the premium pricing, I was underwhelmed by the food. I went for the elotes (mexican grilled corn), a couple of tacos, a chile relleno and the huitlacoche quesadilla. The chile relleno tasted rather tired and bland. The huitlacoche quesadilla didn't contain any huitlacoche, they substituted with a couple of mushrooms and corn. Maybe Singaporeans aren't ready for the real thing. (Huitlacoche, plainly speaking, is mouldy fungus infected corn, i.e. an acquired taste) Their tacos were a little better, but not particularly authentic. Also, $8 for half a ear of corn?! You have gotta be kidding me. Again, it's Mexican street food! Tacos cost between US$2-4, S$8-12 is daylight robbery at around 4-5 times the cost. I've eaten at many a food truck and hole-in-the-wall type places south of the border, I know what I'm talking about.Adios, better Mexican food and pricing can be found elsewhere in Singapore.",

Frustrated for not being able to get a reservation here for friday or saturday night at a good time for the past two weeks (calling on a wednesday on the same week is not early enough), i finally headed down on a sunday night. Even at 6:30pm the place was already packed.Overall I think their food was tasty. i enjoyed my meal, and this place has got their ambience correct for that trendy place with dim dim light (the older couple next to our table made me smile when they used their iphone light to look at the menu) but what ultimately made me knock off one star is the price to portion ratio. It baffles me that $11-13 per taco is just for ONE single 6\" taco. The flautas were $18 for two regular sized rolls, and the quesadilla was also $18 for tiny pieces. Churros were $12 for 5 pieces. The elotes was as tasty as everyone gushed, but it's $8 for half a cob of corn.I think if the prices were 20% less, it would have made more sense. But then again, in a country where $22-28 cocktail has become a norm, i guess this is the price to pay for glam-ed up street food?The drinks on the other hand, is pretty averagely priced at $15-18. The margaritas were pretty tasty!",

My little one LOVED her berry smoothie and I felt pretty great letting her go wild with the smoothie because it was full of almond milk, coconut water, and agave nectar. \u00a0It's great when restaurants present sugar-free, healthy options. \u00a0But when you want the sugar, look no further than the crispy, sweet churros. \u00a0Fried dough and chocolate sauce - does it get better than this?The verdict?I'd definitely return. \u00a0The ambiance is chill and it's a nice, family friendly option. \u00a0This is more of a Californian Mexican style type of restaurant, but in a good way. \u00a0I'm just thinking of my next smoothie there...",
