    "text": "Was so intrigued by the Makgeoli, had to come back a second time, but this time sans the coworker who only liked beer. Had the normal Makgeoli small bottle. It has a stronger kick of alcohol than normal. Was very tasty. Didn't try the standard Makgeoli out of their beer tap, the waitress mentioned it wasn't as strong and was lighter.I've tried the Army Stew, raboki, kimchee Prawn pasta, and bossam. All were good hits to the palate. Bossam - the pork was on the fatty side, but was nicely braised. The cabbage had a unique lemon flavor. The dikon kimchee had nicely grilled garlic that I enjoyed. Definitely a winner dish.Army Stew - spicy stew with sausage, noodles, green onions and other yummy ingredients. I'm used to seeing spam as well though it seemed to be missing. Good and tasty dish.Raboki - a traditional drinking accompaniment (anju). Tubes of rice cake with fishcake tempura in a spicy red sauce is the duk bokki \u00a0and you add the Ramen noodles to make it a rraboki. Ramen + duk bokki = raboki. Kimchee Prawn Pasta - really enjoyed the Korean twist to the traditional Prawn pasta dish. Good Korean bar with tasty anju. Liked the Makgeoli theme and the place is pretty chill. Seems you need reservations to be seated on the 2nd floor.",

There are many other Korean restaurants I would prefer although it's kind of hard to beat a location like this, with the right combination of finger foods and great drinks.They have more than a dozen (if my memory serves) types of makgeolli in all kinds of flavors - from passionfruit to strawberry. There's a sampler but you can also get them in jugs to share. One evening, we popped by before closing and managed to get a table in the packed restaurant. We were led to a table upstairs where it was much more quiet and thus great for having a chat over drinks. They had every flavor available so we chose yuzu and passionfruit.I would definitely recommend the passionfruit - it was sweet and sour, and full of fresh delicious flavor, and you could see all the little seeds in there so you know it's made with fresh passionfruit. The yuzu was a little on the subtle side, I think I'm used to that delicious fragrant kick you get from yuzu tea so I had high hopes that were slightly deflated. It was super refreshing regardless and a good crowd-pleaser.I took away one star for slow service and relatively boring food options. Quite nice for drinks though!",

I popped by with a bibulous friend on a weeknight and had chicken wings, the makgeolli sampler, and regular makgeolli to wash everything down.Oh my. They have good wings here, and I'm not even a wings kinda gal. Juicy, crispy, with garlic bits on it, you will not regret ordering em here.I particularly enjoyed the makgeolli sampler, though I cannot for the life of me remember the flavors. If you have a girlfriend or a date, she will most certainly enjoy the sampler; doubles up as a dessert for someone with a sweet tooth!Did not try dinner items as we came here post-dinner.",

    "text": "This newly-discovered place by me is my current go-to place to indulge in chill K tunes, drink makgeolli and dine on fusion Korean food that is oh-so-yummy.Verdict:- Makgeolli Sampler Set - Good to try this on your first visit to get a taste of the different flavoured Makgeolli. If you're a Makgeolli veteran, I suggest that you skip this. The portion is small \u00a0(of course, it's just a sampler) but looks great for pics. There are 5 in the set - Original, Yuzu, Lychee, Peach and Strawberry and my personal preference is in the order listed.- Yuzu Makgeolli (large size) - Very refreshing and one of my favourites. The large size is good to share among 2 ladies.- Braised pork belly - Per serving comes with a few slices. Honestly, this dish had a chef recommended symbol on the menu but the pork slices were quite tough and chewy. Not something I would order again.- Home-made Tapioca chips - Yums! Goes great with \u00a0Makgeolli with two dips given.- Gangnam Dreaming cocktail - Had a 7up initial taste but faded to a bittersweet berry aftertaste.- Insadong memories - One of the best cocktails I've tasted during my trips to Joo Bar. Refreshing, sweet and had a great cinnamon ginger taste. Double like!Been here 4 times within the past 2 months and will keep coming back for more mod Korean food!Tip: Sit near the bar if you're not here for dinner as it is pretty interesting chatting with the bespectacled bartender Eddy, and see how he mix the drinks for you. Also, you tend to get a bucket of FOC chips if you're sitting at the bar compared to ordering drinks at the usual table.",
