Reserved a table for 4 at 6 PM from a month before, and even though we showed up 30 minutes early we were told to wait until 6 PM sharp - so walk-ins got accommodated earlier than us but they were all given tables outside.Inside was air conditioned while outside was not - and it's really important in hot and humid Singapore! Ordered a package menu for 4 for SIN$288 that includes shark's fin soup, mushroom with broccoli, and fried rice, with Chili Crab being the Piece de Resistance. OMG the crab was so good and the sauce so divinely delicious, we ends up scraping the sauce from the bowl using the fried mantou bread that we ordered afterwards!",

The service was very different as the waiter would bring things out to our table that we didn't order. After I asked him he said they are not complimentary and we had to pay for it so I kindly asked him to remove it from our table as I was not about to pay for something I didn't order. The food was good, DEFINITELY order the black pepper crab if you like spicy food. It was sooooo tasty and full of flavor. The drinks was ok nothing special and the portion of the fried rice was a lot. We also enjoyed the free wifi!",

Unfortunately, while the flavor of the dish was pretty good, it certainly did not merit the market price that I paid ($70). It's a fun dish to eat at first, complete with wet napkins and a bib, but quickly becomes cumbersome and an act of patience. Service was surprisingly spotty during a slow time, and my table had the luck of being seated directly beneath a tree shortly after it had rained, so my food and self were frequently drizzled on from above. (You'd think it'd add to the scenery, but that turns out to be a romanticized abstraction when spending this much).",

Also I thought the flavours hadn't really penetrated the crab. It tasted more like ketchup and sweetness than a savoury food which was really disappointing. The rice and buns were okay. Maybe because the location was in a very central location, which was why it was busier and more expensive? I would suggest trying somewhere else?Tip: the peanuts they offer you at the beginning cost money, so if you don't want to eat them, don't let them put it down.",

Sadly, after looking at the menu we had to leave because they serve shark fin soup and we can not support the inhumane, unnecessary, and unsustainable killing of sharks just to texturize soup. \u00a0Please reconsider serving this product before sharks go extinct over it.

    "text": "Well folks, this former New Yorker is now officially Singaporean!From what I understand, Jumbo Seafood is an establishment here in Singers and I am happy to say that I enjoyed Chilli Crab, Pepper Crab and Drunken Shrimp here!My husband and I came by with some fellow ex-pat friends who were visiting from Kuala Lumpur. Even with a reservation on a weeknight, we had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. But once we sat down it didn't take long for them to take our order and deliver our starters.The drunken shrimp tasted exactly like I thought it would, in a flavorful broth with a hint of liquor. The pepper crab tasted like pepper crab should. I'm always amazed at how they can get the meat to taste all peppery even though the crab shell is tough to break through! And of course, the granddaddy of them all- chilli crab. I liked this version a lot because it did have a little kick to it, but not to the point where I was sweating balls.The service was good, even though the restaurant was fully booked. I also found it kid friendly, as our table did have a toddler, there were other smaller kids at the tables nearby us, and none of the other diners seemed to mind. Perhaps it's because we're all wearing bibs, given how messy crab can get, so we all look like children anyway.Overall, a solid place to bring tourists (or just your local selves!) to experience Singaporean realness. Just remember that this location is NOT to be mistaken for \"Riverside Point\", which is located in the heart of Clarke Quay. I made that mistake while reserving, since this location is called \"The Riverwalk\". But no worries, as they are only about a 5-7 minute walk apart.",

Now to the important stuff- the food!The chili crab is by far the best thing on the menu. The shells on those crabs are so thick you almost need a small hammer in addition to the cracker. The little fried buns they give you are great to soak up the sauce the crab if floating in. The pepper crab was okay. Peppery. Totally outdone by the chili crab.The egg custard shrimp were delicious. The whole peking duck was wonderful. They prepare the whole thing- bring it table side and then skin it in front of you - Wrapping the bits of crispy skin into crepes with cucumber, green onion and a bit of sauce. Yummy! Then take the duck back and roast it again and bring it to you de-boned and sliced. The seafood fried rice was a bit on the salty side.The venison was very tender, not gamey at all and almost buttery. Both dining experiences were great and I'd say this is a must go - local or tourist :)",

It has a nice flavor, especially the sauce, although I have had better pure crab elsewhere. Be aware that you have to purchase tiny, thumb-sized plain bread buns separately, which is a way they nickel and dime you for a higher bill. Most places would offer this as part of a crab order.Surprisingly, the pepper steak was quite good. The pepper sauce was excellent and went around the table many times. The meat strips were cooked nicely and had a great flavor. Similarly, the fried rice was good as well. It was perfect for flavoring with the chili and pepper sauces from the other dishes (much better than the buns I might add). Ironically, the non-seafood items shined at a place known for its seafood. This place gets extremely crowded, so be sure to have a reservation. The prices are extremely high, so be prepared for a large bill at this famous Singaporean seafood stop. The portions do not match the prices. Also, there is a lot of nickel and dime going on here. Be aware that the menu prices are misleading, since they will tell you - oh, we have a minimum order of X for this item. That is, you have to order 2x, 3x, etc. the menu price, making the cost much higher than what is printed. The food is good, but it's not the best seafood available by any means.",

    "text": "Chili crab, chili crab, chili crab -- that was all I heard about from everyone who came back from Singapore. So naturally, this was on the list of must-eats during the trip. I had emailed a co-worker based in Singapore, what were some of the recommendations to eat while in the city? It's like asking a NYC local where was the best place to get pizza. She mentioned chili crab at Jumbo Seafood, and so when my wife's friend's family took us here, I was more than happy. They have several locations, but the one we went to was next to the waters. The view was fantastic, especially at night, and they had plenty of outdoor tables. It bustling with people enjoying chili crab and other local seafood.We ate a ton of food, but let's talk about the chili crab. The crab isn't your standard Dungeness crab that we're all used to in the states. They used Sri-Lankan crabs, which had huge, meaty claws. The crab meat was succulent -- nice and sweet, extremely juicy and tender. It was a like giant, delicious mutant crab.As for the chili sauce, it's hard to describe, but it's similar to the dipping sauce that Brodard uses for their pork spring rolls -- only chunkier with more crab meat inside, with a lot more complex flavors, and ton spicier. I'm talking really spicy. Maybe it was because I was practically drinking the stuff, with the help of the fried and steamed bread (man-tou) sopping up the juices. Then I washed it down with some local Tiger beer. Man, was it good. If this was in the states, I'd be a bona fide regular.",

    "text": "I was VERY disappointed with nearly every aspect of this place -- let's chat about the basics: 1) it was outdoors on tarmac, exposed to bugs and whatever blew by. \u00a02) the washrooms had NO SOAP nor dryer or towelling -- this washroom was used by the STAFF who prepared and delivered food to tables as well as patrons. \u00a0Any place in where there is no proper hand-washing facilities concerns me greatly. \u00a0This last fact should close them down for sanitation review! The photos of the food on the menu did NOT match what arrived in several cases. \u00a0The low quantity and low quality of the food for the high price charged was simply outrageous. \u00a0They seemed more interested in upselling alcohol than serving food, once they knew you weren't going to be drinkers, the wait-staff ignored us for quite a while before coming back to place our order. \u00a0When the food was ready, it was rushed to the table in an effort to turn the table as soon as possible. \u00a0They charged $78.00 for a single chopped up crab (a/k/a crab bits) was more than a bit pricey for what you got. For $22.00 you get a 3-cm cube of codfish. Six tiny scallops surrounded by an enormous amount of yam cost $18, again not worth the price and they tasted oily.Maybe they were good at one time, that's not the case any more -- at least not tonight, and for a bill over $200.00, you'd expect that you'd get quality service and quality food with a hand-wash facility for patrons and staff that had the basic necessities. All-in-all, I have nothing positive to say about this place and need to simply state that this seems to be an expensive, low-quality tourist trap for those that don't know any better. \u00a0Avoid at all costs and seek Singapore Chilli Crab elsewhere -- ask a LOCAL. \u00a0We'll never return.",

Although I use Yelp regularly, I never write reviews but this one place was so unbelievably bad, I felt compelled to write my first review. On the one positive side, the seating process is efficient given that the place is run like a factory. On a busy Friday night I was seated within 10 minutes. But sadly this is the only positive thing about the restaurant. The service was appalling! I was the only one at the table who didn't have a place setting and I asked 4 times before I got one. The waitress kept mumbling under her nose. I noticed that none of the dishes on the menu had prices. I ordered one chili crab and a glass of wine. The waitress also brought peanuts and tea. I didn't love the crab but felt good about having tried it as the typical local dish. Then the bill came. It was over $120. The crab was $80 which I thought was ridiculously overpriced. I was also charged for the peanuts and tea I didn't order and also didn't touch. I was appalled. The entire experience was very unpleasant and left a bad taste in my mouth. I recommend you avoid this restaurant.",

The night was warm, and there was a cool breeze off of the river. People were starting to gather at the lively Clark Quay area, and only made the anticipation of my meal greater.Once seated, we ordered the Black Pepper Crab, Chili Crab,Cereal Prawns, Scallops in Yam Rings, and then load of fried and steamed buns. For three people it looked like a lot of food (and it was), but I could not stop eating. The flavors were not too spicy, not too sweet, not too salty - nice and balanced.

Marcus L and his girlfriend did the ordering and soon we had the plastic bibs on and red chill sauce stained in a glove shape all over our hands.We ate a lot of great food, my favourite was the crab, though I think when you have such beautiful crab meat it's a shame to cover up its delicate and exquisite taste with an overwhelming chilli sauce, I would have much preferred it just steamed and eaten it cold without any seasoning or sauce, but I think I'm a seafood purist when it comes to crabs.I also loved the dish which is tiles of cooked fish and prawn paste and topped tightly with a chicken skin. What is the name of this delicious dish? Jumbo was expensive, even by Perth's extortionate standard, but it's 'the best' and right on the water so I guess that's to be expected.Book ahead to get a table inside in the air-con!",

Sure the price is expensive and the wait here can be daunting but with a little bit of planning ahead and an expectation to spend $60-$80 per crab this place is quite all right. The chili crabs are delicious (as judged by me, a possibly misguided foreigner) and the wait can be spent at one of the many bars nearby as they send a text message when the table is ready and wait 5-10 mins for you to arrive if you ask for it. As for the price, it's a meal for an occasion or when hosting visitors anyways and given the location near the circular road this place is worth it.",

We chose this place since it was most convenient and we were walking along Boat Quay. Eating crab can be quite messy and that is why I chose a nice sit down restaurant with white tablecloths. If you haven't figured this out, most food places (food court, hawker centres, etc.) don't provide napkins. I really appreciated the cloth napkins, bowl of water and lemon, and the large sink right outside their bathrooms.Since my foodie friend was still recovering from food poisoning, she only could eat the steamed mantou. :( So I ended up eating the whole chili crab and finishing it all by myself! :D It was delicious!The seafood was fresh. Service was very quick and efficient. The restaurant was clean and empty at 2pm.FYI: There is free wifi nearby (but weak signal). If you can, they have a promo going on that if you \"Like\" them on Facebook you'll get a free drink! :) Check their website for more specials!Nearest MRT station: Clarke Quay",

Somehow there is something about eating crabs which brings the family closer. Maybe it is the mess where everyone just digs in using our hands and fingers, trying to pry the sweet meat from the shells. Bibs are now provided so you don't get gravy stains on your tops. The must order dish is the chili crab, plus the fried mini buns (mantous) to soak up the addictive spicy sweet chili gravy. The rest is an afterthought. The food is generally decent but for the fried rice and hor fun, they lacked the wok hei flavor of tze char. Sambal kang kong, fried tofu, cereal prawns and the likes are just ok or average. The service is fast and there are two seatings. The first is from 5.45pm to 7.45pm and with the speedy way they served the dishes, our two tables were done within 90 minutes. Lots of eating and less talking I guess. Getting to the place is a bit of a hassle, if you have elderly or those who can't walk well in your dining party, as they are plenty of steps to navigate. Parking is available at The Riverwalk (turn into Upper Circular Road) or at the URA parking lot behind. I much prefer Dempsey location which is equally crowded.",

Everyone around us seemed to be taken care of, while we felt ignored for 90% of our meal. I realize the service-standard is completely different in the US of A compared to many parts of the world, but it was enough to make us leave in a hurry.

    "text": "This place is the holiest of holy sites in Singapore when it comes to seafood.If you want ridiculously tasty Chili and/or Black Pepper Crabs - this is the place to go, especially if you only have time to visit one particular seafood restaurant in Singapore.If you go with the Chili Crab, make sure to get the fried mantou so you can dip it in the oh-so-delicious sauce. \u00a0If you go with the Black Pepper crab, you'll be happy as well, so long as you don't mind looking absolutely disgusting after you finish you meal. \u00a0Good thing they have huge sinks here for you to wash your face and hands.There's plenty of other dishes that should be on your list - such as the incredibly tasty steamed fish, drunken prawns, even the salted fish fried rice is a must try. \u00a0Their mango desserts are also excellent and remember to wash it all down with a nice big ol' coconut juice. \u00a0But there are some things to note as well:1. \u00a0The peanuts here are not free. \u00a0There are still plenty of instances of nickel-and-diming bullshit in Singapore and this is an example of it. \u00a0Be sure to tell them right off the bat you don't want the peanuts and that you don't want to be charged for it.2. Same deal with the tea. \u00a0That shit ain't free. \u00a0If you don't want to pay - tell them. \u00a0Ask for water instead.3. Also remember the crabs are charged by weight. \u00a0Make sure you ask for the size of your crab and the cost per kilo before you order. \u00a0Otherwise, you might get stuck with a $100 dollar order of crab and not realize it.Another weird thing I noticed on my most recent visit ... I ate here three times and on all three occasions nobody ever bothered to return my change. \u00a0I had to bitch and moan each time to get my money back ... what gives??? (Btw - they do include a service charge in the meals FYI)",

It really puts me off when restaurants restrict the amount of time you are allowed to stay for a meal. Luckily, the food came quick after we placed our order. Nonetheless, the meal was worth it. The chili crab was delicious. The sauce... wow... I wish I could bottle the sauce and bring it home to drizzle over my rice every day. Finger-licking good! With the seafood fried rice, it was a lot of food for two people. I suggest coming here with a larger group so you can try a variety of dishes. Would have given it 5 stars had I not been rushed!",

Considered by most people I've talked to as one of the top two or three crab restaurants in SG (which is world famous for crab) and I understand why. The crabs are huge. We had one chili crab and one pepper crab for five people. Soooo good. also some fried noodles, spinach with garlic, prawns with some kind of sweet, dry crust on them (wish I could remember the name) and of course, buns to soak up the sauces. Plenty of pitchers of cold Tiger beer to round out the meal. Reservations are highly recommended as it is crowded every night. On the border of Clarke Quay and Boat Quay, with both indoor and outdoor seating. Service is efficient, lots of people refilling glasses, getting more beer. Not overly friendly but that's not really an issue, you'll be too busy chowing down to care. Highly recommended",

I was looking forward to trying the chili crab, but price to taste ratio was not worth it in my opinion. Almost 80USD for one crab drenched in s tomato chili sauce with scrambled egg. The garlic butter crabs in San Francisco were much better and half the price. For sides we had greens at almost 12 USD, and the portion was tiiiiny. Do not accept the peanuts they try to give you when you first sit down. They will charge you. You are given one measly towellete to use. How is this possible when you have to dig in with your hands???I guess you are paying for the view and location? We were a party of 3 and asked to sit at a table closer to the water but was told it was only for parties of 4 or more. Yet, as we were leaving I noticed a Caucasian party of TWO sitting at the table I asked for. Definitely never coming back. There are a lot more seafood options in the city.",

    "text": "When in Singapore, it seems chili crab is a must try. So my sister and I trekked over to this location before our flight. Luckily for us, there was no wait! I think we arrived right before the lunch crowds poured in - it got really busy as we were eating. The chili crab was something we definitely had to get but my sister also wanted to try the cereal prawns. I noticed the menu had a prix fixe for two people (150 SGD) which included a variety of items. Although the price tag was steep, who knew when we would be back in Singapore! We took the plunge and I would say I am pretty happy with our decision. We were able to try a variety of items including lychee soda, dragonfruit lobster salad, fried rice with egg, cereal prawns, chili crab, and a pomelo sago dessert. I loved the lychee soda - refreshing and not too sweet. My least favorite item was actually the dragonfruit lobster salad - it was literally just chopped dragonfruit mixed with lobster and mayo. The fried rice with egg was pretty good and came in a huge portion (I think this could have been enough for 4 people)!The star of the show, the chili crab, was DELICIOUS! The crab meat was juicy and flavorful. The sauce was not as spicy as I thought it would be - in fact, it was pretty sweet. However, it was still really good and tasted fantastic when you dipped the fried mantou in the sauce. I also enjoyed the cereal prawns which literally tasted like shrimp covered in crushed cereal! Sounds weird but it was yummy! We ended our meal with a spectacular dessert of pomelo and sago. I would give Jumbo Seafood five stars if not for the spotty service. The girl working the front seemed really frustrated and was not very welcoming. The waitstaff inside were very nice and friendly, but service was very slow.",

Jumbo's was recommended as a typical place people go and was convenient from my hotel. I was told I must make a reservation and was glad for the advice when i realized i couldn't get in for a couple days. This location was less busy than the one just up the river at riverside. Overall my experience was just ok. The service was a little weird as they kept trying to deliver things i hadn't ordered and after accepting one of the items realized at the end that they just charge you for it (I guess its like up selling) I told them I did not want the tea or peanuts and noticed on my bill they removed these items (so they were going to charge me!) I was also by myself and was brought a rather large crab ($61) I probably should have requested something smaller but didn't think that was the way they worked here. The Chili crab was ok, but I won't go out of my way to try again. I would say this is a great place to try Chili or pepper crab if you are visiting, but once is enough.",

It's dry compare to the chili crab, there's no sauce but it's more intense and flavorful to me!It's about ~$90SGD/crab after tax for the smallest size you can pick.I ordered some other rice dish and vegetable dish because some of my family dont eat seafood, the dishes were ok but definitely not worth the price.Again, come here for the crab and you will not be disappointed!Tips: Line/queue might be long, so try to make reservation before you come!",

Oh yes, we also ordered a side of stir-fried broccoli, $14, which was more wok-steamed, and very delicious with garlic.Several beers each....burp. \u00a0As other advised, we told staff to remove peanuts, and yet we were still charged for the ice tea that we never order (they promptly took it off the bill when I said something).All in all, as others have stated, great succulent, sweet crabs.Order all your food as soon as you sit down, as your 1 1/4 hour dining clock starts then (they'll get pushy as it nears your expiration--if they ran the parking meters, we'd all get tickets).",

The first location had too long of a wait and sent us to the second location, where the wait was a measly 45 minutes. When we finally got a seat we ordered the benchmark Chili Crab, \u00a0kang kong sambal, and scallops in purple yam. We also ordered the Lychee Italian soda and the green apple Italian soda. The drinks looked pretty and tasted much better than imagined. I wasn't drink that night but damn a beer would have gone so well with that crab. The crab is swimming in sauce that is pretty damn close to perfection. I wish I had just some plain white rice and could have engorged in that stuff alone. The crab was fresh and good. The kang kong was our way of trying to justify eating an entire crab and the scallops were just as good. Second piece of advice, the scallops with the crab sauce is a large improvement over the house sauce. The bill was a bit high but not unexpected for an entire crab. Would eat again with more folks to feel less guilty.",

Our first reaction was holy &$@/. We even asked her if she was sure if that was the only type of crab left and if we could get any other type of smaller crab, but she promised us that it was the last one and even spoke to the back with her transponder to \"save the LAST crab for me\". She even promised us that it would not be too much for 2 people. I thought it was weird that this place would run out of its signature dish so quick, but since I'm only here for 2 days, I decided to get it.Then as more customers came and ordered smaller crabs, we called her over to question her and she denied everything and saying she only said that was the last Alaskan crab. Now I would forgive her if we didn't ask her 3 times to make sure that was the last of any crab and if she didn't quote \"save the LAST CRAB for me\"...They also charge everything from peanuts to water, and they WON'T tell you unless you ask. So definitely watch out for that since they bring out the peanut to you without you asking for it like it was free.",

There are two locations on Clarke Quay(pronounced Clark Key) very close to each other since they are both very busy catering to the hungry tourist. I actually found this place from the hotel I was staying in. The place is definitely a great choice, but it is pricey.The food:Roast duck with mango- This was the only dish I wasn't completely in love with. It was a good dish but the combination of mango and duck was off for me. yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026Boiled shrimp in a sweet and sour sauce with a side of jellyfish. I thought this dish really worked. The shrimp was cooked nicely and the sweet and sour sauce paired nicely with the shrimp. The jellyfish doesn't explode with flavor, but was a nice contrast in taste and texture to the shrimp. yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026Broiled jumbo prawn with Japanese mayonnaise. So utterly amazing. It was so perfectly cooked. The prawn and mayo was perfection. yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026Singapore chili crab- This is Singapore's signature dish. It was excellent! The chili sauce is sweet and slightly spicy, the crab they used was Dungeness Crab and we ordered Mantou buns to sop up all the sauce. This dish is so messy but completely worth the mess. It's a must get in Singapore. yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026",

Minor thing to call out, they put peanuts on the table for snacking before the meal comes out, you think it's free but there's a small charge. \u00a0I've also heard they sometimes charge for the napkins (which you'll need) so ask before taking a big stack. \u00a0Overall, this place is slightly price given it's a chain restaurant but it was a good meal!Make sure to call for a reservation. \u00a0We had a 7pm rez and had until 8:30 to finish, I didn't feel rushed but I'm sure they would have notified us had we overstayed out time. \u00a0There's another location just a short walk on the Clarke Quay Riverside walk so make sure to go to the right location.",

What tainted our experience was the hostess at the other Jumbo location on Merchant road (not sure where this review most appropriately fits). Being tourists, our cab dropped us off at the Merchant road location, right in time for our reservation at the Riverwalk. Once they let us know we were in the wrong spot, we asked if they would let the other location know we were on our way. The hostess said she would not. Having a toddler in tow did not elicit any sympathy from the hostess, and she reminded us we had 10 minutes left to make our reservation before it was given away. Eventually, the food was good. I have never had chili crab, and thought it was okay. The fried buns are a bit greasy, I would stick with the regular ones. The food is pricey as expected. I thought it was a good one-time food experience. I do not feel the need to go back and visit again.",

I'm still getting used to the lack of napkins in Singapore, so that was an adjustment -- Bibb, plastic gloves, finger bowls and wet wipes, but no napkins for a very messy meal. With nothing to compare it to, the crab was just OK. I enjoyed it, but it didn't blow my mind and leave me salivating to return (though perhaps Chili Crab in general just isn't tasty enough for me to yearn for it, especially at the price -- which was very comparative for chili crab in Singapore).

    "text": "One of the 2 things people said to do while in Singapore was \"Chili crab!!\". We needed to find the best place to test, to have a thorough opinion, so we poked the brains of every uber/taxi driver and local we could find. We found out everyone has a different opinion. So since we wanted to go to Clark Quey, we decided on the Jumbo at the end so we could walk through the madness afterwards. We ordered the chili crab, malay style noodles, and the little bread balls. Before I state my opinion, I have to say that I am a big fan of crab. I love Than Long, PPQ, Crawstation... and at most places, I can eat the shells clean and usually want to take a straw to the leftover broth, but I was not tempted to ask for a straw here. We were slightly disappointed in the flavor that was so hyped up by our friend. The malay noodles on the other hand...omg must get. The flavor was beautiful. The little bread balls were nice to, not necessarily necessary, but good for soaking up said chili sauce (which is not the same as sipping the broth; the bread just needed something).This location is pretty sweet and we didn't have to wait in line. You might need to sit with other people at a large round table, but it's a cool experience and you can see what other people order. The group to the right of us ordered the king crab legs, and the servers brought out the giant crab ALIVE in a basket so he could meet the people that held his fate in their stomachs before being whisked away to the hot tub. I'd go back and maybe try chili crab at another place...maybe.",

We are not on the airport runway, lol!), indoor seating with really good AC, no visible bugs and plenty of soap & towels for the patrons. Back to my review:I love that the restaurant gives out bibs to the patrons. The bibs are so cute!!Had a reservation at noon today. We ordered chili crab, black pepper crab, deep fried prawns in cereal and a dozen of buns. Chili crab - definitely an A+. It was not too spicy and I really believe the chili crab here is better than those at No Signboard at Esplanade. Black pepper crab - that's a B. I have definitely had better black pepper crab elsewhere. Deep fried prawns in cereal - A. \u00a0The small order has generous amount of prawns. At $24 and came without the shells, that was not bad at all. This dish was good but those at No Signboard at Esplanade is slightly better. Fried buns - A+ Despite someone commenting I have \"become fatter\" *eyes rolling* just last week, I have been indulging in fried food. The buns here were golden and crispy on the outside, and so soft in the inside. This definitely complements the Chili Crab. Definitely order these buns to go with the Chili Crab. \u00a0Service was top notch and the staffs took peanuts and tree nuts allergies very seriously. So no chili crabs for those allergic to peanuts!! Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try out Singapore's famous and very popular Chili Crab!!",

It was definitely disappointing to speak to a manager who's more defending himself rather trying to accommodate his customers.Moving on to chili crabs, it was delicious, forgot which one we ordered, but it's got eggs on its broth, fresh and juicy! I love the flavor and savoring the sauces w a bowl of rice! we did not ask price as it's not indicated on the menu, and we were aware it was by weight so we ordered one to share along w other dishes. the razor clam was really delicious too! Overall, I like the food, although it's definitely overpriced especially the chili crab, ours came out to be over 60 SD for one small crab, as some of the yelpers mentioned, there were also shady about the price. And yes, they charged petty things like napkins, tea and peanuts! \u00a0I'd probably not want to return w such terrible manager and steep touristy price!",

I'd recommend getting a side of white rice to put the leftover sauce from the crab on. \u00a0Also got the veal which was solid, but nothing so outstanding I haven't had at other places. Don't really think it warranted the $40 price tag. Aside from the food, environment was pretty nice and obviously in the very popular river walk Area. It was pretty lit on a Friday night.

It's located by the river walk and patronized by a lot of out-of-town visitors.FOODChili Crab - Very good but extremely expensive. I think we paid $50USD for 1 crab which is ridiculous, but I can see why it's so popular. The sauce is a delicious blend of sweet and spicy and perfect with rice or man tou (buns) on the side.Man Tou - Yummy! They're slightly sweet and slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Definitely recommend! I just wish they were a little bigger because you can eat one in 2 bites.Noodles - I don't remember the name on the menu, but these noodles were super yummy. They were nice and sweet and spicy, and a decent amount for 2-3 people.Chinese Broccoli - This was just ok. I'm not a fan of Chinese broccoli in general and thought this dish was a bit weird with the thousand year eggs and egg yolk.SERVICEThe servers are super busy here and we had to flag ours down multiple times. They're very nice though, and the food comes out fairly quickly, considering the amount of people in the restaurant.OVERALLThe food was good, but overall very pricey (especially their famous chili crab). But would I come here again? Yes, because even though it's touristy, the food is still good.Oh, and that glass tray of yellow liquid on your table? It's just tea with lemon to wash your fingers with after eating crab. Don't drink it. You're welcome.",

We got lucky and were able to walk in without a reservation. We sat outside while it was lightly drizzling, but we were not uncomfortable at all. The outdoor part of the restaurant had umbrellas to shield us from the rain, and the waiters provided covers to protect our belongings.",

    "text": "If chili crab is something you must try when visiting Singapore, then Jumbo Seafood is one of the best places to try it. Yes, it is a chain restaurant that is very pricey and very crowded, requiring a reservation if you want to avoid a long wait in the unrelenting heat. And if this is your first time trying chili crab, it will invariably fall short of your lofty expectations. But you should definitely still eat here when given the chance, because despite all this, the food is delicious.I personally favored the black pepper crab, which came smothered in a potent pepper sauce packed with a subtle kick, although the chili crab was delicious as well. Sopping up all of the sweet and spicy chili sauce with the fried buns was a most satisfying experience. The salted egg prawns were a pleasant surprise, with the egg yolk providing a mild flavor and interesting texture, while the sweet and crispy fried baby squid made for a perfect little appetizer. Despite being a bit of a novelty, there is no doubt that Jumbo Seafood prepares some quality seafood and a mean version of chili crab. If you're willing to deal with the steep prices (they charge for everything including the peanuts and wipes), the lackluster service and are lucky enough to score a reservation in the air conditioned section, you will be treated to a very tasty meal.",

So there is lots of people watching and fun stuff to see in the surrounding area. We ordered the chili crab and broccoli. The sauce on the chili crab was great! Also the crab was fresh and delicious. You can tell everything is made to order. The broccoli was too oily for me but it was cooked to the right tenderness. The service was fine..fast and efficient but not very friendly. Bottom line...come here for the ambience and the chili crab!!

The ambiance was amazing...the wait is super long so you definitely have time to grab a happy hour drink nearby. You put your name in \u00a0the queue and they will call you when your table is ready. You can request your own table or a shared table which is probably quicker to get seated at. They quoted us 90 minutes but we were seated in less then 45. \u00a0Now, on to the food. Though we tried the chili crab, my friend told me her favorite was the salt and pepper (which I wish we got instead). The chili crab is good but a bit too sweet for me (it's basically doused in sweet chili sauce - the kind you might dip your eggroll in). \u00a0I prefer my crab on the savory side. We also got the fried rice - LOVED it. Morning Glory was to DIE FOR. \u00a0And their special bread was a must to dip in the crab sauce!It seems almost impossible to have a bad meal in Singapore so this is another good one! I enjoyed myself and left with a food coma!",

    "text": "I can't say enough great things about the amazing crab dishes we had here!! We went after getting repeated recommendation/vouches for the jumbo seafood as the \"go to\" place to try Singaporean chili crab even though at first we were hesitant due to the fact that it was a chain joint. However, despite a bit of difficulty getting reservation (we used the app Chope) and slowness in service, I have to say the food itself was AMAZING! :) For the two of us, we ordered 1 veggie dish saut\u00e9ed in garlic sauce and one chili crab and they were both a pure delicacy! We got medium spiciness and was just perfectly sauced, spiced, cooked/steamed and cracked \u00a0(to be eaten easily). What a joy! We then proceeded to order a Pepper crab which was warmed in delicious butter and exotic black pepper and it was like experiencing a whole new world, a world's apart journey in flavor from the chili crab. Yum!! I'd recommend both since they are very different, but if I had to choose one, would probably go with the classic (chili crab). Also beware that the crabs are not cheap - about $70 SGD a piece - so be prepared to spend some $$$ if you're willing to adventure on trying both! Next time I definitely want to try their buns to dip it in the chili sauce as well as the fried rice! Also I'd highly recommend this location located by the beautifully lit Singapore River as it's only a short walk to all the beautiful sights and sceneries by the water as well as the Fullerton Hotels and the Merlion :)",

Night one after arrival, we found ourselves here. \u00a0There were 6 of us, and I thought my (male) coworkers were joking when they said we were going to order 4 crabs. \u00a0At about $60/crab...say what?!?1 \u00a0But wanting to have the full experience, I acquiesced. \u00a0The final menu for our table:- 4 crabs (2 chili, 2 black pepper)- an order of the tiger prawns- fresh steamed abalone- fried rice- bok choy (because you need your greens)The crabs were good, but to be honest, I enjoyed the black pepper crab better than the chili crab, which was marinated in so much tomato sauce that it was actually quite difficult to eat. \u00a0 The tiger prawns though....this was worth it. \u00a0It was about $15/skewer (of ONE prawn) but it was one of the best prawns I have ever had. \u00a0The abalone was silky smooth. \u00a0The fried rice and bok choy were as good as fried rice and bok choy can be, but nothing out of this world.The total bill was a whopping $700SGD...ouch! \u00a0But when in Rome, right? \u00a0I am glad we tried it, but at these prices, I am not so sure it was worth it. \u00a0I wish I had a point of comparison, and should have tried it at other places, but that will have to wait for the next trip. \u00a0 I would definitely recommend a go at the Abalone and for sure the prawns. This is what upped it from a 3 to 4 star in my books.p.s. I truly do appreciate they have a hand-washing station. A definitely must! =)",

    "text": "We had to try the famous chili crab that Singapore is known for, so we went to probably the most well-known place in the city (country?) that is known for it. Keep in mind that there is one right across from Clark Quay that we got this location confused with - so we ended up being slightly late for our lunch reservation here. That said, we were able to get a seat inside easily enough, although by the time we had left, the restaurant was quite packed for a weekday lunch. Service was pretty quick and easy, although one of the menu items we wanted was not available despite it being early on in the day...a bit puzzling, but not a dealbreaker. The drink selection has a lot of juices, but the alcoholic selections (beer and wine) are a bit on the light side.The crabs themselves...they are huge, but they are very tasty as well. For someone who is a bit less experienced at pulling apart seafood, I made an abject mess of it (thankfully, there are wet wipes and plenty of extra napkins provided), but the meat was fresh and infused with the delicious fragrance and taste of red chilis. One could be forgiven for thinking that the crabs were swimming in chili oil before being cooked. Be prepared to fight for the meat, though; it takes a lot of patience, and you have to watch our for the sharper edges on the shell once your hands are slippery from the oil. Outside of that, though, the rest of the meal was very standard-issue Chinese food, and given the premium the restaurant places on the crab, everything else is pretty overpriced in comparison. The fish maw soup I had here was definitely worse than I have had in China (or in Chinatown in NYC), and it was quite a bit more expensive. The mushroom tofu dish we got as our other side was similarly bland and uninspiring, but it set us back nearly S$20 (possibly more).The crab lives up to the hype, and I would come back just to eat that alone. But the rest of the meal was overpriced mediocrity, to put it bluntly - unfortunately, the magic that comes along with the crab isn't really present on any of the other dishes.",

ServiceWhile you might expect the service at a chain restaurant to be sub par, you'd be wrong about that at this particular Jumbo restaurant. The service was notably great. They were attentive, efficient, mindful of the number of guests in our party, and quick to keep us updated on the status of our cooking crabs. One manager even went out of his way to convince us NOT to order so much. He saved us $100 and a night of misery. That was very hospitable and ethical of him. FoodOMG. If crab was meant to be served and eaten by gods, then there ought to be no other way to serve or eat crab than this. The perfect balance of sweet, tangy, salty, and spicy. I don't know how else to describe the succulent taste that enraptures your taste buds. We ordered both the Chili Crab and the Blk Pepper Crab. Both excellent. But above I am speaking of the Chili crab. EnvironmentExcellent location. The restaurant is always jamming. But they do a good and efficient job of spacing everyone apart.

    "text": "What can I say. This is the place to go for chilli crab, black / white pepper crab / egg yolk crab which I categorise as \"die die must eat\" hahaha....If you have enough people to share, I suggest you to order a bigger size (i.e. 1.5 kg), which the claw is more like a piece of steak and is much more fulfilling...sometimes sharing a 900g crab by 2 is not so enough. In that case I usually end up coming again before I take off back to HK...There are 2 Jumbos around Clarke Quay - One is right at the river side which is more open and the view is better, good to go with client / foreigners. The other one is at this Upper Circular Road which is indoor and it is less crowded in terms of seating but usually serves 3 rounds everyday (6:00 - 7:30, 7:30 - 9:00, 9:00 onward). However we were not being kicked out at 9pm and stay there till the end.....Anyway both serve the same food with same high standard. Booking is needed.",

Of course, chilli crab is a must, and it's very good. The sauce is hot but really flavorful. \u00a0It's not quite as great of a chilli sauce as the Seafood International out by East Coast Park, but still good. \u00a0A perfect dish is the fried 'mantou' (buns); excellent dipped in the chilli sauce. \u00a0The slightly-sweet breadiness helps to cut the spice. We usually get a couple of veg dishes, too, which are pretty standard. The cereal prawns are not bad, but since then I've gotten just salt and pepper prawns instead.All in all, I will still come here if I'm meeting people in the downtown area. Reliably good and not so overpriced.",

    "text": "Last week I was down from Tokyo, where I live, in Singapore for a tradeshow. This was the third time this year that I've been to Jumbo and again it lived up to the billing. My pal Sophia, my go-to Singapore Foodie says Jumbo is the place to go for crab and when it comes to food in Singapore, what Sophia says goes!There were a group of 12 of us, thirsty from chatting with customers all day and ready to drain some Tiger beer and murder some crab. We started with some appetizers including some great river shrimp. The chili crab was the first to come-as the other reviewer said, the mantou buns are a must, for mopping up the extra sauce, of which there's plenty. We also got some veggie dishes and noodles to keep the crab company, but I was waiting for his brother to make an appearance. Finally the pepper crab came-also awesome! Whereas the chili crab has an ebi-chili sweetness about it, the pepper crab lives up to its name an has a peppery after-kick. \u00a0 Good thing I cut my nails the day before-Singapore crab, like sand at the beach, gets everywhere, and it was nice not to have to dig it out, per prior visits.The riverside branch of the restaurant was bustling, as always, and we sat outside, as always. great people watching and the river after dark feels cool-the icy Tiger helped. Bill for a dozen, eating and drinking reasonably but not leaving hungry, was SIN $600-ish, pretty reasonable by business dinner standards, compared to North America US or Western Europe. It's F1 this weekend, so the place is probably packed-reservations advised even after the show moves on. It's popular with locals, expats and tourists alike. There are six locations to choose from. Enjoy!",

When ordering, the waitress said that the only crab they have available was a 1.5kg crab. Having told that this crab is 'finger licking' tasting, hence I didn't hesitate with a 1.5kg crab. When the food came out, I noticed that the crab looked unusual. The shell was only the size of my Samsung galaxy and pieces were mixed from other crab. The texture of the meats of each pieces and even the sizes of each legs did not match what I was expecting from a 1.5kg crab. I asked the waitress, which she denied and tried to brush it off. I felt that I was ripped off for paying for a 1.5kg crab which it was only a mixture of different sized crabs. Apart from that, the taste was excellent.",

Huge fish tanks in the back where you watch whatever you ordered get taken. Lol maybe it's just my tender heart but I've always had a hard time with that type of display, but moving on. A lot of bareness in regards to decoration etc.We had a wait but it wasn't bad for dinner on a Saturday night. Once we were seated we went to order. I thought seafood would be easy gluten free but apparently not. I was initially told they couldn't make me anything. When my friend pressed with more questions annoyed at how dismissive the server had been we finally settled that I could have a plain steamed crab with none of the sauces (it was apparently impossible to not put wheat in any of them, even the garlic and olive oil) and the scallops and vegetables plain. My friends ordered other things. The worst part is that all these things came out and I was just sitting there waiting and watching them eat for 45 mins. They finally brought the scallops which everyone ate as well. We then all sat and waited. We had to ask five.. Yes five.. Times about the last crab. Me still starving. We were blown off several times. Asked to speak to a manager twice who never came. Two hours after being seated it finally came and everyone just watched me eat. Food was good though mine was bland as they offered no sauce options, but seafood was fresh and portions good. They also charge for everything without telling you, the peanuts on the table? Yep. The tea they bring you? Bet ur bottom $When I return to Singapore I won't be rushing back.",

Reservations for weekends are recommended.Service is attentive and with a smile - a good balance of Singapore efficiency (that you see everywhere, including the way trees are planted on sidewalks) and hospitality; the waiters here who make sure you are taken care of without becoming too much in your face!We ordered the following - Crab with salt ad pepper - if you are a fan of good crabs, I mean really good crabs, and are not afraid to roll up your sleeves and flex your muscles in cracking crab shells, then this dish is for you. Cooked perfectly and great flavors and spices, this dish is a winner. I had to stop myself in sucking on pieces of the shell so as not to look like a hobo!Seafood noodles - well made and the shrimp and squid were cooked perfectly. Had a bit off a kick tho, but I still could not stop eating it.Farmed frogs - One of the best versions of frog legs that I have had ever. The sauce was awesome (pardon my limited repertoire of powerful English words) and stood on its own compared to the crab!a MUST try seafood restaurant when in Singapore!",

    "text": "CHILI CRAB. \u00a0Mmmm...Being in Singapore, the one dish you cannot leave without trying is chili crab. \u00a0So when I finally received my last paycheck for my summer internship there, I decided to splurge \u00a0on Singapore's speciality, after hearing from my coworkers that Jumbo had the best/most famous chili crab to offer.Maybe it's the fact that I'm young, or the fact that I'm a girl and sometimes don't need to pay for my meals, but \"splurge\" in my book was clearly not the \"splurging\" I had intended to do. \u00a0I ended up dropping more than $60 on my meal. \u00a0And I had split my bill with my roommate, who was also sitting in disbelief that the two of us would consume $120 worth of chili crab. \u00a0In my opinion, this restaurant was way overpriced, which, along with the marginally acceptable service, is the main reason why I only gave it three stars.Mind you, the crab itself was very delicious. \u00a0The chili is a tomato based sauce, so it was sweet and not overwhelming, and tastes delicious with the fried buns. \u00a0I might say that their other dishes are quite good too--if you can get over the fact that a plate of veggies and tofu would cost you $35. \u00a0This also might sound pretty petty, but at first I was pleased that the server poured us tea and served us peanuts... until I saw that the two showed up on my bill at the end. \u00a0Why would I pay to eat a small dish of peanuts at a seafood restaurant. \u00a0Especially when my server disappeared for the vast majority of the night, even when I wanted a refill of said overpriced tea and/or peanuts.However, the ambience itself is quite nice--the restaurant looks nice, and sits right in the center of Clarke Quay (read: tourist central), so you can get a nice view of the Singapore River and the thousands of people passing by and jealously watching you eat seafood. \u00a0This restaurant is extremely crowded, however, things should be okay if you make reservations more than a week in advance.I highly doubt anyone but tourists and birthday celebrators eat at this restaurant, but being a tourist myself, it's fair to say that this restaurant's signature dish definitely left a lasting impression.",

    "text": "First Yelp review in Singapore!! Everyone tells me that I have to try the chili crab when in Singapore so when the opportunity came along (friend I met during this trip wanted to go to this place to celebrate her birthday) I was totally down for it and I'm so glad she invited me. There were five of us and we ordered two crabs, one chili and one black pepper. we also ordered some noodles and veggie plate.I shared the ginormous chili crab with the birthday gal and oi was it delicious! the sauce was amazing! I thought it was going to be super spicy but it wasn't. The sauce was just perfect - spicy but not so spicy that it feels like your tongue is on fire...as a matter of fact it was very flavorful. You can enjoy both the spiciness and flavor - what's more amazing is if you dipped the bread into the sauce or even put a few spoons onto the noodles. The crab, itself was fresh and meaty. We each paid about 35 dollars...which isn't too bad honestly. I consider it pretty cheap. I would definitely want to try the pepper crab next time since this time I didn't really get to try it.",

    "text": "I ate here twice in July 2013. I had the pepper crab the first time and the chili crab the second time. I FAR preferred the pepper crab, it is traditional Singapore-style in simple pepper broth, not a sweat creamy sauce like you sometimes see with this dish. The chili crab, I found the sauce to be too \"gooey\", not for me, to each his own. I also ordered other items like Mee Goreng noodles, VERY good and spicy. The seafood fried rice was also very good. Overall the service was fast and typical for a place like this. Surprisingly, they have some good white wines that pair very well with the spicy dishes. Recommended.",

    "text": "Way over-priced place that is tourist central, I'm guessing because lonely planet recommended it. The chilli crab was pretty good, but again, expensive. And what really put a damper on the experience is how they serve you peanuts and walk around pouring you green tea like it's complimentary, and then it shows up on your bill! Pretty shameless.As long as tourists keep coming, they can get away with these practices. I highly doubt any locals are eating here.",

    "text": "Ask any taxi driver where to get chili crab and you will probably get a different answer. Everyone has their own opinion. In MY opinion Jumbos is always consistently good. \u00a0They have a decent menu and you can definitely find something for everyone. I love the mocha pork ribs. One of the reasons I really like jumbos is also because you can get the cereal prawns deshelled. I'm sorry but I'm a white guy and I dont like durian and I dont like prawns with the shell on. \u00a0I find the chili crab sauce here to be a tad bit sweeter. \u00a0There are other spots that have bigger crabs but I think all around with the food, crab options and different branches all over its a pretty safe bet. In terms of this branch there is ALWAYS a wait. If youre calling for reservations the same day for dinner forget it. Otherwise you'll be eating at 10pm. \u00a0The service is not friendly but its there. \u00a0If youre a live here and you and your friends are ALWAYS taking friends/visitors to chili crab sign up for the jumbo membership:)",

    "text": "I'd rather write this review in Chinese, because I ordered in Chinese, thus don't remember the english name of any dish I ordered 6 months ago...But well...This is Yelp...Of course everybody comes here for a chili crab. Their chili crab was satisfactory in general. Delicious and \u00a0Classy. Though I would recommend the corner eatery near Upper Thompson Road, which provide the most yummy chili crab ever in a less decent environment, unless you are taking your mother- and father-in-law to dinner.As I said, \"Classy\" is a tag on everything in Jumbo Seafood. If fulfills all the western fantasy of an eastern country, with Jade Tofu, 10cm-long razor clams, the iridescent reflection on the Singapore River, the fish-eyed twakow boats, and the numerous modern skyscrapers. Try it! Ignore the price tag!",

    "text": "I usually head to the branch at East Coast Park because eating seafood by the sea adds authenticity to the dining experience (or so I think). It's probably just an unfounded bias that eating seafood next to the sea makes the catch more fresh?! When in reality, I know that the all of the products probably came from the same wholesaler who delivers them to each Jumbo branch. For convenience's sake, you might want to dine at the branch at Riverwalk which is at the heart of Singapore's nightlife - Clark Quay.My favorite food picks are, 1. Black pepper crab - Order the fried buns (known as \"mantous\") it's sooo good! Then dip it in the black pepper sauce :)- Expect to get your hands super duper dirty! (Definitely not a dish for the first date). They will give you some lime water to clean your hands with after the meal but the crab smell will still linger. 2. Steamed bamboo clam with garlic and vermicelli- Love it! bamboo clams taste like chewy abalone :) 3. Steamed prawns- You'd be surprise how good these prawns are even without any seasoning! They usually serve you some soya sauce with slices of red chili to dip the prawns. 4. Fried you tiao stuff with fish cake- Honestly, I did not expect to be a fan of this dish because \"you tiaos\" (fried dough strips) are sooo oily but the ones at Jumbo are crispy and golden. The fish cake inside makes it even more flavorful and savory! Perfect combination. Ambiance: Jumbo's restaurant (outdoor seating area) is overlooking the beautiful Singapore river so you get a good view of Singpore's old port (now a tourist hotspot for boat cruises). I would recommend Jumbo over the boat cruise any day!",
