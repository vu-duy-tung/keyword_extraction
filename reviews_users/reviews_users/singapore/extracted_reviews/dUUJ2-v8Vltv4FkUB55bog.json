    "text": "To start off this review - I am not a fan of steak. To change my mind, my friend said \"once you tried Luke's, you will be a fan\". And indeed he was right. Luke's Luke's Luke's, what can I say. Everything I fancy in a nice restaurant - modern decor, yet having abit of old chic feel with its booths and lights. \u00a0Almost thought I was in a scene from Mad Men and I can just bump into Don Draper having an old fashion neat in the corner. Service was impeccable and our waitress was knowledgeable and offered valuable opinions. We ordered their fresh oysters for the day, and the 400g naked prime rib (medium rare) with half lobsters tail, hash brown for sides and 2 glasses of wine. Was about to order a dessert when the restaurant surprised us with a really sinful and delectable double chocolate birthday cake (it was my birthday). I could probably give it a miss for the oysters but my oh my ... The prime rib and the sweet garlic that serve ... Just typing about it right now makes me wish I'm there for dinner again. The steak was so good on its own , you wouldn't even need the mustard. Perfectly caramelised on the surface and tender and moist inside. The lobster tail was sweet, light and having a tinge of lemony taste. Gosh, and don't get me started on their hash brown. So sinful but decadent with that herb cheese stuffed with it. If it wasn't so expensive though, you would find me here maybe weekly. Well done Lukes !",

    "text": "My 200th review! Boy, I've been on Yelp for a while now!I was taken here for a dinner on a Saturday night and being there reminded me of being in a chop house in the States. The waitstaff here are dressed as they would be in the US, and the place itself is clean-looking, small, and bright. It gets quite busy and crowded here on a Saturday night so be sure to make a booking. There weren't many empty tables in sight. They proclaim on their menu that all their seafood is procured from sustainable sources, so if that is a concern to you, eat re-assuredly here!We started with a tuna tartare (4/5), and portions run big here, so I am glad my companion suggested we share the prime rib-eye with garlic. The garlic is actually a whole head of garlic oven-roasted. This would probably be the only grouse I have with this meal, with that being that the garlic could have been cut in half and roasted with oil to a darkened goodness to elevate it further.I think the real star of the meal were the sides. I cannot forget the hash brown! The hash brown is a giant plate-sized of very crispy and finely-julienned potato, with some herb cheese stuffed within. This is a winner! I think they should have a breakfast menu and sell this as a rosti. The other sides were equally good, with the bacon, which is actually a slab of pork with maple and a slightly heavy-handed touch of liquid smoke, and crunchy green apple salad on top. Somehow in my head, after my first bite I assigned this dish to an Angmoh \"char siew\" of sorts, so I got a bit confused every time my companion asked if I wanted some bacon. We also got the creamed spinach (3.5/5)In true 'Murican fashion, we washed it all down with cocktails. I was glad that their Moscow Mules are served in copper mugs here, because it doesn't seem all that common in Singapore for some reason. Dessert! Banana and coconut pie with avocado ice cream, and some really nice crumble on top. Just the right amount of sweet, not overbearing, and very nicely warmed. Oh I do like this place! I would I like this place because of how it makes me feel, also perhaps maybe I do miss America. P.S. I love the musik here. And the service.",

    "text": "Went here tonight for the first time. We tried quite a bit during our first experience at this restaurant and I can honestly say it was all good! The Tuna tartare is an excellent starter, so flavorful and well presented. The ciabatta bread that it came with was lightly buttered and toasted just perfectly (not overly crispy). When we realized that the restaurant had some boston roots, we had to order the clam chowder to see how they stacked up; it was wicked good dude. I won't forget the taste, it had some strong black peppercorn, which was perfect with the creaminess of the soup. My wife had the Rib eye \"naked\" and I had the scallops. I specifically ordered the scallops knowing that I'd probably end up eating a lot of my wife's steak. The scallops were presented well, dressed with some large capers, and the sauce was very delicious as well (if I'm not mistaken it may have been butter based?). They offered a side of coleslaw, which I didn't end of finishing, because if found the dressing to be a bit in the strong side. The steak was choice. Loved the seasoning they threw on it, really offered a ton of flavor to the outer side. They also offered 3 fancy mustards, \u00a0(though I feel that the steak itself required nothing additional), it was a nice complement. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and the kale salad as sides thinking that the portions would have been smaller. I won't write about those yet because we were so full that we ended up doggie bagging them. Overall great place, great atmosphere, prices are most definitely appropriate for the quality of the food. Enjoyed it very much and look forward to going again!",

    "text": "Luke and Naked Finn are my two most favorite angmo restaurants this year. I have heard about Luke for ages but have just never made it there till recently. If you are like me, just go there now now now!Restaurant is not big so it does get booked up fast. I could be wrong, but I think if you are not a big group, you can do a walkin and sit at the bar.Yes, they are famous for their oysters as the name indicate, but apart from that, they do have a good menu. Good quality food done properly, none of the fancy sauces and foams. Between 4 of us, we shared:- tuna tatare (love. One of the better ones I've had in Sg. Perfectly seasoned with lots of flavors)- crab cakes (so full of the sweetest chunky crab meat. None of those crap fake crab cakes)- kurobuta pork chop (yummy and succulent)- prime ribeye (my least favorite but still a good piece of meat and a very large slice!)Special mention: OLD STYLE HASHBROWN. Whatever you do, order it. This is like nothing that you've ever tried. A perfect side dish, more like a rosti than a hashbrown. Crispy on the outside, and they filled it with Boursin cheese and spring onion. Pure genius and perfectly done.All the portions are really large. And when they heard that we are sharing, they actually served the dishes with 4 proper portions. No judgement for sharing dishes here. So we were all perfectly stuffed even though we did not order one main course each.Service was also great by Singapore standard. Our server heard that we are celebrating a birthday and they served up an awesome dessert that is full of candied ginger flavor. So so good. While it is not a cheap meal, we felt that it was well worth the money. Looking forward to returning for brunch as they serve up a brunch menu that has lobster roll....and yes, please also throw in the hashbrown.",

(My view was facing a plain white tile wall and a fire hose reel. With all of the commotion behind me, I felt like my chair was in the way) The prices say fine dining, but the overall ambiance does not. \u00a0Because of this, I would say that the food (and dining experience) is waaay overpriced. Our table for 2 was almost too small for everything to fit. \u00a0It was like an ice cream shop table and chairs. \u00a0On the other hand, the mammoth bar runs almost the length of dining room and takes up too much of the small shop house space. \u00a0The bar could be downsized by half. \u00a0 What they really need is a larger space.For dinner, I had the tuna tartar and the \"Luau\" ribeye. \u00a0My companion had a selection of a half dozen oysters and the prime rib au poivre (+foie gras). \u00a0The shared sides were the hashbrowns (with boursin cheese) and creamed spinach. \u00a0The tuna, the ribeye and the hashbrowns were amazing. \u00a0The prime rib had a (very peppery) peppercorn crust/sauce. \u00a0The foie gras was nothing special. \u00a0The tuna chunks were served on a layer of avocado chunks (tossed in a vinaigrette) and accompanied by grilled buttered bread. \u00a0Really memorable. \u00a0It could have been a meal by itself. \u00a0The luau flavours on the huge ribeye were a caramelized pineapple glaze(?) and I wish the flavours had been less burnt tasting. The tender meat was cooked perfectly. \u00a0The crispy hashbrowns were delicious. \u00a0The oysters and spinach were just what they should have been, though we wouldn't order either on a second visit.With 1/2 dozen oysters, tuna tartar, ribeye, prime rib (+foie gras), 2 sides, 3 martinis, a glass of red wine and 2 coffees, the total was $478 for 2 of us. \u00a0As good as the food was, I still can't bridge the gap between the high prices and the crappy small table too close to the front door. \u00a0A little overpriced for my book, but we look forward to returning for another special occasion. \u00a0Maybe with a larger group, we'll be treated to a grown up table further from the front door.",

Nonetheless a cool east-coast joint filled with swanky jazz music. The food is overpriced for the portion sizes and location of the restaurant.The food 1. Lobster sliders - Ok. Loved the mini toasted buns (tasted like fried mini man tous @Jumbo) but they were way to small even for me (a 5'2, 110lbs, petite, Asian lady). The lobster bits were ok. 2. Jumbo shrimp cocktail - \u00a0BAD. The waitress marveled at their house made sauce which was pretty awful. I can't quite put a finger to it. It felt like someone went crazy in the kitchen and mixed all types of flavors together - sweet, salty, sour etc... Sometimes less is more. 3. Clam chowder - Love! Thick & rich with generous sized clams in them. 4. Jumbo lump crab cakes - Love! Filled with real crab meat not those cheap mixed stuff some restaurants give you. 5. Tenderloin pepper crust $69, grilled foie gas +25 lobster tail +25 \u00a0- Sadly, Overcooked. The meat was tough and dry. However, the sauce was good. The foie gas - I passed on. The lobster tail was sweet and good but for $25, the size was measly. I could finish it in 2 bites. \u00a06. Oysters & clams - Ok. 7. Cornbread - LOVE!!! My favorite dish actually. Simple yet amazing. This was served as an starter instead of the staple, bread. It was a small, bite size muffin shape :) Service - Ok Ambiance - Interior deco Good. Simple yet classic. Mostly expat crowd.",

It's true, the food is not cheap, but it's worth it.What I love about Luke's is that it's a 5 star restaurant that's totally unpretentious. Small enough to be cozy, extremely attentive service, perfect place to impress a first date or client. Now, the food. The clam chowder and prawn cocktail are my favourite appetizers. The lobster roll is excellent too (I think that's only lunch), and the prime steak is melt in your mouth. They used to have this avocado banana coconut tart that was magical, but have sadly replaced it since. Maybe if enough people ask about it, they'll bring it back! Until then, definitely have the choc chip cookies with the stout milkshake for dessert.",

    "text": "I wouldn't describe Luke's as a family place.Nor would I describe it as a place most people would be able to go to regularly.The food though, is almost always top notch, though there are certain things I'd give a miss because they're so much more mediocre than everything else on the menu.The lobster roll, available during lunch, is delicious. Marinated lobster meat in a buttery roll, it feels sinfully indulgent and is absolutely yummy. The burger, with bacon of course, is also very good.During dinner, I'd recommend the Lobster Pot Pie to anyone who likes lobster, or pot pies. BUT. At $99++ a pop (or pot for that matter), it's painfully expensive.And that's really my biggest dissatisfaction with Luke's. The place is prohibitively expensive! Sure the list of must-orders goes on with the clam chowder, the oysters, the clams, the shrimp cocktail, the cold lobster, the lobster sliders, the veal, the pork chops (I find that their steaks, whether at lunch or dinner, are spectacularly mediocre and not worth the money), but the prices!As someone who thinks that $450 a head at Shinji is worth it if you go every 6-9 months, and that $300 for dinner at Andre is, by comparison, a steal, it should say a lot that I think Luke's is prohibitively expensive. It's not an 8 course set menu, or a sushi omakase experience. It's an a la carte experience that can come out to more than $100 a head, depending on what you order, and while the portions aren't stingy, they aren't overwhelming.I'm regularly bewildered then, that Luke's is always so full that can't take reservations even when I'm calling a week in advance. Maybe they don't like me. Maybe they really are that busy. I don't know. All I do know is that damn some people earn a lot of money, and that the food at Luke's is undeniably delicious.And also (to me, at least) excruciatingly expensive.",

    "text": "Great service. Value for money food. Camehere to celebrate a special occasion. When I made my reservations I informed them that this is a birthday and they said they will give a complimentary cake. Didn't have to follow up during dinner. The cake was served when we asked for the bill. I am not so blown away by the oysters. Its not bad but I was expecting something more. I would still recommend this place thou. The steak was surprisingly good. Ambiance was nice and cozy and service was great.",

    "text": "The good: \u00a0Luke, the owner, knows his East coast style/influenced seafood. \u00a0Excellent lobster rolls, oysters (which are hard to find in Singapore) and sides (unsung heroes). \u00a0I'm also a fan of their beer and wine selection, and the bartender/server will give you interesting nuggets of info on each. \u00a0Location and music is good; once you walk in the place you feel transported to Boston (for those of you who have been, it's like a mini Eastern Standard - one of my all-time favs). \u00a0They also run a promo for oysters but the timing is such that because of work I can never take advantage. \u00a0The bad: \u00a0I get what they are trying to accomplish, but it could be more friendly to a wider array of patrons. \u00a0What I mean is that sometimes when I go dressed casually I get looks, and sometimes I don't. \u00a0The staff is...stiff...and there isn't a need to maintain such snobbery. \u00a0The ugly: \u00a0It really comes down to pricing for me. \u00a0When I'm craving some fresh seafood, I head down. \u00a0But it's not cheap, so I keep my cravings to a minimum. \u00a0Tone down the fine dining schtick a bit, as well as the prices, and I'd be a regular in a second. \u00a0That seems to be a common theme with places in Singapore: good food and atmosphere + expensive = people don't return often",

    "text": "Luke's was good, with a rating of 3 stars for average in it's price range. To be fair, I had a cheeseburger at a place that bills itself as an \"oyster bar and chop house,\" so I was probably not hitting their signature dish. But I'd been dying for a good cheeseburger and I was cautiously optimistic that this might finally be the place in Singapore that could deliver. With all the add ons (house-cured bacon, egg, and cheese) the price crept up to $42++, so I was hoping to be blown away. It was pretty good. My wife has more refined tastes, so I got to try the lobster pot pie and the lobster corn soup, with kale salad and creamed potatoes on the side. These dishes were all more well-suited for their wheelhouse. They were generous with the lobster, so they earned the price point. ($115 for the pie.) I'd say the winning dish was the kale. Fresh, crispy, well-tossed, and nicely seasoned. And they had some conservative but respectable draft beer (Hitachino lager).",
