    "text": "Maybe it is the location, out in Sentosa, or there is a labor crunch. In any case, the service was bad to non-existent when we were there on a Friday night. My uncle booked a private room with 2 tables for a family dinner. There was a minimum spend required for a private room ($500 per table, so $1000 for 2 tables). After the staff took our orders, the service went downhill. We ordered fried rice and fried noodles first while waiting for the others as there were kids and we wanted to settle their rumbling stomachs first. It still took about 45 minutes for the fried rice to be served. And my cousin had to go find the ready dishes and it basically became a self service dinner. For most of the dishes, my cousin went out of the room and brought in the food, with the pegs and papers still attached to the plates. We had to repeat our request for warm water 3 to 5 times before it was served. I actually went out to help myself but was told by the server to wait and they would bring it in. But zilch. The service got a bit better towards the end (close to 9pm or after 9pm) as someone actually brought in the dishes. So maybe there was just not enough service staff to handle the dinner rush of 7pm - 9pm and so food was left cooling in the holding area. The food quality was ok, as what you would get in any of the Jumbo (or the others) outlets. The problem was with the lack of service. We paid at least $1000++ for a private room. You would think the service would be slightly better with at least a dedicated staff to the room. It is just appalling. Imagine if this is a business dinner and this happened. The private rooms are on the 2nd level and I am not sure if there are any elevators for those who have difficulties in climbing stairs. So 2 stars for this place even if the food is good.",

Service is great, location is perfect - you can take a nice stroll after your dinner. I love how they offer signature dishes from the four famous restaurants in Singapore. I always get their cereal prawns, tofu with spinach, black pepper beef, black pepper crab and chilli crab with fried man tous. I recently went back to Singapore for a short trip and was disappointed to find out that they removed their chrysanthemum ribs. BRING IT BACK. It was so good.",

    "text": "Out in Sentosa, so maybe not too many people know about it. Came here because my cousin had a coupon but the place was also quite delicious. The restaurant is a hybrid of 5 chefs from reputable restaurants that highlight each respective signature dishes.FRIED SMALL FISH: more of an appetizer than anything else.CHILLI CRAB: absolutely delicious. Does have a kick to it but still not too spicy that you don't want to eat it. The sauce is also perfect for dipping that perfectly warm and soft STEAMED BUNS.BLACK PEPPER CRAB: way too much pepper for my own taste. So much that I couldn't eat too much of it because I also ended up inhaling the black pepper and that was painful.FRIED PRAWNS WITH CEREAL: Prawns are saut\u00e9ed with a special blend of oat cereal, curry leaves and fiery chilli padi. Also one of my favorites mainly because of the sweet oat cereal. DEEP FRIED SCALLOP WRAPPED IN YAM RING: Fresh whole scallop, embedded in soft yam paste, deep fried and served with traditional sweet \"Ngoh Hiang' sauce. This one was also a WINNER. The yam was soft and the ring was very crispy. The scallop also tasted very fresh.SERVICE: the service was ok. It could have been a lot better considering the atmosphere of the restaurant and the fact that there were not many customers. They took a while to take our orders and would forget to bring out certain dishes until we mentioned it to them.ENVIRONMENT: rather than nice ambiance since it's in the Sentosa area. There are multiple stories so just remember where you party is if you come separately. Inside the restaurant is bright with white seat covers. It feels fancy but not to the point you know you're breaking the bank (even though you are).Overall, I'm glad my cousin introduced us to this place. However, fortunately we had a couple otherwise it would have costed us a fortune. Though none the less a lot of things in Singapore are expensive. Despite the cost, I would still come back every now and then to eat some of this delicious food!",

    "text": "Had their three-course meal offered by Groupon at $88 which served Award Winning Chilli Crab, Herbal Drunken Prawn (believe it was my favorite tiger prawn), and Steamed Red Snapper (steamed fish). Initially, I thought that the food won't be great as me being a cheapskate purchasing a $88 food voucher worth $158. But to my surprise...... I highly recommend this place. Great place to hang out with friends and family. After your meal, try taking a 10-min walk by the sea to Vivo City, it's good for digestion. One negative comment though. I went there on a Wednesday's evening and they seem to be short of staff.",
