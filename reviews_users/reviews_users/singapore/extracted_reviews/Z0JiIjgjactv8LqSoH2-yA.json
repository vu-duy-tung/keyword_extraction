    "text": "After a long day of seeing the sights as a tourist, I found this wonderful restaurant features in a blog post (many thanks to ieatishootipost) and decided to give it a shot. It ended up being the best decision I made all day. After taking a quick trip to the ATM around the corner (cash only), we ordered xiao long bao, pan-fried buns, chicken mushroom noodles, sauteed pea shoots, and pan-fried dumplings. Everything was phenomenal! Our favorites were definitely the xiao long bao and buns. The flavor of the meat is just right and absolutely mouth-watering, and the soup is a perfectly spiced complement. The buns were fluffy with a perfectly crisped, not-greasy bottom and completed by the juicy and savory filling. At home, we eat at Din Tai Fung pretty regularly, and this was way better! Everything else was superb, too!We were especially thankful for the warm hospitality from the couple that own and run the place and their son (who speaks good English). They were very kind and clearly put a lot of time, effort, and love into the food they serve! We wish we could come visit more often!",

    "text": "This modest little eatery located at the base of a generic HDB block is a real gem. The place is small, so call ahead to reserve if you've a big group of diners. And if you have a big group, order everything on the menu in multiples because the portions are small too. The cooking here is quite refined although the menu is small and prices are reasonable. I'd recommend the xiaolongbao, the shen jian bao and the shanghai spring rolls. The xiaolongbao has a lovely sweet soup and the skin is delicate enough to not result in a doughy knot at the top but strong enough to withstand a chopstick grip from basket to plate. The shen jian bao has a tasty meat filling but it is the crunchy bottom, covered in a layer of nutty seeds, that makes this a win. The Shanghai spring rolls are deep fried a la minute, and comes to the table atomically crispy, with skins that shatter satisfyingly with each bite. The filling is shredded cabbage instead of the local turnip version. The drunken chicken is very fragrant with the wine and silky in texture. Also good is the braised pork belly with sweet mei cai, unctuous and melt in your mouth. As for the vegetable options, the french beans are crisp and surprisingly spicy. But for me, it is a photo finish between the wild rice stems and the chives in egg. This is the only place where I've ever seen wild rice stems - they taste like a more delicate version of lily buds. The chives are cooked in a creamy scrambled egg and superb. There are two dessert options but I'd advise a miss. Expend your calories on the main dishes as they are the star of the show and really worthwhile. The only quibbles I have with this place is that it can get really noisy as it is small and full of hard surfaces that bounce sound around. And the chef-owner can sometimes be a tad temperamental. Do not make the mistake of asking for vinegar and ginger with your xiaolongbao because he will lecture you on how that is the crutch of restaurants who do not know how to make a flavourful xiaolongbao. I've seen him do that to other hapless diners before. So be warned!",

    "text": "This place is amazing! It's heaven on earth! I can't believe that I haven't tried this place until today. The restaurant is managed by a husband and wife team. The wife sources the ingredients and personally flies to China to get the best things there. She's very passionate and believes that people should only have healthy and good food. She also doesn't take any short cut. There are some ingredient that you can get easily from the factories, but she refuses to do that. I think I can go on and on about their cooking philosophy. Let's just say, you need to try the food yourself. Xiao Long Bao- very powerful soup. No need extra sauce or ginger. Hand made noodle- the texture is amazing. The best I have tried. Pork buns- she flies to China to source for the best salted veggie used in this item. The sauce, bun, and pork can send you to heaven. The veggie- I was initially skeptical about this dish. How can a super green simple dish be so good. I'm so used to having veggies cooked with garlic or chillis. But, this simple dish blew me away. It was delicious. I'm already counting down to my next visit to try their other items. \u00a0Do make a booking though. They can get really busy and it takes awhile to get the items. My advice is don't rush through the food. Enjoy every dish.",

    "text": "The dishes are delicious if you enjoy rich heavy flavored. However if you think you can fill up your tummy, then you'll have to order lots of dishes. This is because all dishes are small. The steam dumplings are only 5 to a basket. So for 2 persons, you'll need to get 2 baskets. We also ordered the fried buns which are very delicious, together with Shanghai wanton soup, braised pork noodles. The prices are reasonable but the stir-fried dou Miao is rather pricey at $12 for a small plate. Both of us paid $44 for 4 dishes and tea. A rather reasonable deal.",

    "text": "Authentic and homely, this is what Shanghai Ren Jia offers.A very sweet Shanghainese couple who came to Singapore almost a decade ago opened this humble restaurant to make a simple living by doing what they do best - cook.As everything is freshly prepared only after you order, waiting time can be a little long but you can be assured that it's worth the while cos the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is truly a real treasure. ;) Personally love their xiao long bao and their cong you mian (hand made noodles with shallot oil) is a great staple! Of course the si ji dou and zui ji (drunken chicken) are other authentic shanghainese dishes that are not to be missed.Cos the restaurant is a very small set up, walk-ins may find it hard to get a table during peak dinner time so it's always better to just call and make a reservation. To keep the waiting time shorter, you can also pre-order your dishes so that they can prep the ingredients prior ensure prompt serving upon your arrival.",

Try the fried pau, noodle with pork, and omelet with chives. The fried pau is great, crispy on the outside, with soup and meat inside! The handmade noodle was very smooth and springy, while the omelet was simple and worked very well with the chives. The meal comes with a big jug of hot chrysanthemum tea. The waitress also mentioned that the spring roll and xiao long bao are also the top-selling items, but we were too full to try them, so those were for the next time.",
