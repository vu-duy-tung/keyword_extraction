    "text": "Our first night in Singapore, and we spent quite a bit of time wandering Chinatown. What drew us into Lime House was the atmosphere. It just seemed warm, and carefree, and fun. Warm lighting, fun music, welcoming staff.We were really pleased with our food. We ordered the \"nachos\", avocado toast, and jerk chicken. The bottom line, is that the we loved our food! The ingredients tasted fresh, and the mesh of flavors were tasty and vibrant. However, I will say that all three of the dishes we ordered were kind of a twist on what you would expect. The nachos were on a bed of fried plantains. I love plantains, and my two year old loved them, too. They did not come with a traditional cheese topping. There were \u00a0sour cream, tomato salsa, and guac toppings. The avocado toast was on pita. It had pesto and avocado/guacamole and was very garlic-y. The jerk chicken was super tasty, but not like any jerk chicken I have tried before. It was very savory, and not as spicy as I expected. There ya have it. I'd definitely go back. especially for a gathering with friends.",

    "text": "My review stems from several times that I have been here, and it is a difficult one to make. I like the food here, I think it is a REALLY good representation of Caribbean food that can be found no where else in Singapore. This is good. However, the front of house is in shambles. The management is so poor that you are left wondering why they have not gotten their act together since they have been opened for some time. In addition, there is a high-handed way that 2-3 of the waitstaff/front of house folks adopt when dealing with customers here.But what truly sealed the deal for me is the fact that they initially would not accept Entertainer App for tables which are reserved (\"only for walk-ins\"). When I pointed out that this was not the case when reading through the terms and conditions of the exclusions for the app, they reluctantly agreed. We saved a paltry SGD60 from a meal that was over SGD500, so the attitude that came with the incorrect information was really uncalled for.There is a GREAT disparity between the food quality and service quality here. I heard the chef is leaving, so I will not be back any time soon.",

    "text": "Sure, Lime House is the only Caribbean restaurant in Singapore at the moment, and I'm not the leading authority on all things Caribbean. But they are truly a fun establishment, and their love for all things Caribbean shows, from the food, to their venue, to their parties.I'd say that their top two dishes are the jerk chicken and the curry goat. The jerk chicken is a great dish to start with if you're unfamiliar with the awesomeness that is the Caribbean. Want a little more kick? Curry goat is for you!Jack Sparrow once asked \"But why is the rum gone?\" Well, the answer is because Lime House has all. of. de. rum. Rum for days. Don't miss their cocktail menu, and for goodness sakes, please choose something that's rum based.If you ever have the chance to attend one of their weekend parties, DO IT. They are one of the few venues in Singapore who give you strong drinks, great music, and a crowd that ACTUALLY DANCES. (Feel free to refer to my review of Trace for more info.)When you're ready to lime (Caribbean term meaning to chill with friends) let me know. I'll be right over.",

Three of us ordered two appetisers (red snapper ceviche, wings n tings) and three set lunches (jerk chicken, parrotfish, doubles) along with sides (fried plantain, macaroni pie). The dishes were all spicy and flavourful. The fried plantain was novel too - a Caribbean version of goreng pisang.The waiter was chatty and friendly, and promptly refilled our waters when he realised one of us was having trouble with the spiciness.We spent $38/pax; it would have been somewhat pricier for dinner.",

My countenance dropped.Turns out the place is not open on Mondays, which would HAPPEN to be the day I decide to walk on by...It was a semi-sad day cause this was one of the very few Caribbean restaurants in Singapore. No Caribbean culinary orgasms that day \u00a0-_-We chatted a bit more, exchanged info and I went about my way.Ok, Singapore...We have another costly, week-long date to plan for the future.",

You're on island time, sugar... Enjoy the music and the tropical breezes...When you're feeling warm from all that rum, line your stomach with the fantastic macaroni pie and maybe some doubles... Follow that up with some goat curry and a deconstructed pina colada and feel all your worries melt away with that heavenly food coma...Great for vegetarians and carnivores... Especially high value for lunch!PARTING THOUGHT: if you can, try to go to the Lime House Liming Carnival party! \u00a0Like an epic Caribbean block party with live reggae!",

    "text": "Went on a Thursday night with a few friends. Pleasantly impressed with the decor - straddles between a good place for romance and to chill with friends. Just in-time before happy hour ends, we had a few beers while waiting for the rest. $12 for a 1-for-1 Sol beer (very light - Corona style). Cocktails were slightly pricey at $20. Ordered a few appetizers - crab cakes, dumplings and chicken wings. The crab dumplings were great - two large dumplings with tonnes of shredded crab meat. Easily re-classifiable as a entree. Wanted more but held out for the real mains.Had the Jerk Chicken. The dish is not bad on its own but lacks the all-spice taste associated to Caribbean Food. Chicken was not grilled too (maybe it was but the slathered-on spicy sauce masked it too effectively). The best dish was the Seabass. The fish was fatty and very fresh but not sure if there's anything Caribbean about it.Lime House actively promotes the place as a venue for events - I do think it's a good alternative to other venues though the food can be thoroughly improved.",

    "text": "Heard lots of great things about this restaurant so made a reservation using Chope, a great online reservation service.Upon arrival, I was told they did not have our reservation on record b/c they did not get any notification from Chope and tried to turn us away. I pressed on and they tried to seat us outside on the front porch, which we protested b/c it was a warm evening. About ready to give up, the server asked for my contact information so they can take care of us next time and lo and behold as I was giving my name and phone number, I could clearly see it listed on the reservation list. Their tune changed then and asked us to be patient as they cleared a table inside. We sat outside for maybe half an hour. The service here is HORRIBLE. Very hectic and disorganized. We have to ask for everything from water, to refills, to even menus.I hear they've just opened so maybe they are still working out some kinks but our friends came during Valentine's Day after having made a reservation a month in advance. They were seated, ordered drinks and food, waited over an hour, didn't receive any food and eventually left. That's insanely bad service and they were almost turned away a 2nd time b/c of some staff confusion around how to organize reservations.The food? It was actually not bad. I had the baby back ribs which were quite delicious on a bed of mashed potatoes and veggies. Highly recommended if you are brave enough to battle bad service.I'll likely not return and don't recommend others to frequent until they work out their service issues. The vibe is just so very frantic and unsettling. We sat inside next to the bar and the bar top was just littered with dirty used cups piled one on top of the other. Kind of kills whatever ambiance they are trying to achieve.",
