Everything from the onion pakhora to the tikka (fish and chicken), the Dahl, the usual Indian breads, it's all fabulous food, eaten in the outside tables under cover so relaxed and breezy. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "The menu here was pretty extensive and reading thru other people's reviews, we tried some of their favourites:Onion Bhaji - my kids attacked this dish as its a starter. They loved it so much they even ate their deep fried curry leaves that was in it! Hubby said this was like extreme Muruku. Onion strips with Muruku coating! Must eat there, fresh and crispy!Butter Chicken - buttery and creamy and just delightful. My girl was practically drinking the sauce! Mutton Tikka - they didn't have it on their menu but this is a FAVOURITE dish of my hubby's and their chef very generously said yes. So they made that dish specially for him. It was also another hit with my children. Even I was impressed. I have tried many others and theirs was really one of the better ones. Rogan Josh - lamb chunks cooked in spicy curry. I swear mutton is not the easiest meat to handle and they do it right! And the curry sauces are seriously distinct from each other but still oh-so-yummy!!!Aloo Gobi - I was slightly disappointed when I saw their it was quite dry with no sauce. But the taste just knocked my socks off. Seriously one of the best Aloo Gobi I have eaten. I could finish bowls of this!Chicken Biryani - this was served in this deceptively small bowl with lovely spiced rice and tenderly cooked chicken chunks. My girls LOVED the chicken in this dish. And after many spoons of rice was eaten, the bowl still looked kinda half full!! Hub and I was so full after we finished the rice but no regrets there. Butter and Garlic Naans - this was another great dish. We ordered 2 first and then had to top up with another naan. Evident that my girls were just packing the naans away!!!We are seriously fans of this very understated eatery now. The service is swift and very sincere.",

I'd definitely pay them a visit if you're in the area.",

    "text": "This is our go-to place for Indian food in our neighborhood. (Ooh look at me and my fancy rhymes!)I love Indian food, but my husband? Not so much. However, he doesn't mind the dishes here. They've won us over with their butter chicken: big chunks of tandoori chicken in a creamy, not spicy tomato sauce. Mmm! If we're really hungry, we add in an order of butter naan (because if we're going to eat a \"buttered\" main, we might as well go big or go home!) As for their other dishes, the chicken tikka masala is very solid, and I thought their rogan josh was pretty good too (a bit spicy, though.) Note that they are located in the corner of Balestier Plaza, with outdoor seating only. The service is friendly and prompt. We've been here when it rains, and the staff is pretty good at moving the tables and chairs a bit further in to ensure nothing gets wet. Also, if it's busy, they always manage to pull a table out of nowhere and set it up for you. So far, we've never made reservations and we've been lucky to get a table each time. I do find it a bit pricy for a restaurant that is outdoor seating only, but the quality of the food makes up for it. The portions are just right, as well.Solid choice for Indian food if you're in the Balestier area!P.S. They do have a TV inside the small bar area, but you can't really hear it if you're outside.",

However, based on my latest gastronomic experience in India, I can safely conclude that this Indian shop is the REAL DEAL. Not only is this restaurant better than any restaurant I tried in the Motherland, but also the chance of getting Delhi belly is zero. A true win-win for sure. My favorites at this restaurant are the (i) Butter chicken, (ii) Chicken Tikka masala and (iii) butter naan. One has to wonder why one would need to go to Delhi, when you have this shop in Balestier. Two words: Taj Mahal. :D",

You always know the food is going to be authentic when they not only have Kingfisher beer on the menu, but also Kingfisher Strong. Tandoori Corner did not disappoint. The food was excellent. I greatly enjoyed the murgh malai tikka, fish tikka and their assortment of naans. The tikka dishes were note-worthy, and the accompanying mint sauce was as authentic as you can get. I was instantly transported to my favourite spot in Delhi! It certainly is pricey in comparison to other eating places in Balestier. We paid slightly over S$40 for two. It was, however, a real treat and a nice change from the usual fare in Balestier. My only real gripe about this place is the set-up. Situated next to a clinic in Balestier Plaza, there is no indoor sitting space and the tables have been placed along the corridors of the neighbourhood mall. Not very picturesque at all.",

The lamb chops in particular were so good we had to order some more. Service was brisk but friendly. Only advice would be to watch out for the Kingfisher with 8.8% alc by volume. It will catch out the unwary if you don't realise just how strong it is compared to other beers.We will definitely be back",
