I think it should be somewhere between 4 to 4.5 stars. \u00a0I would have expected the place to be mostly empty on a Monday night but it was surprisingly busy.Before going in, I was able to peruse the menu and they had a section of items going for up to 50% off. \u00a0Wow! \u00a0They had me at 50. \u00a0They had two maki rolls one at $7.80 and the other at $9.20 Singapore dollars.So why not? \u00a0I went in was seated at the sushi bar and I ordered the Roasted Salmon with Tenkasu Roll and the Sakura Shrimp with Sweet Shrimp Roll. \u00a0Let's be honest here. \u00a0I am not a roll fan cuz you can get some really weird combinations so I was taking a risk here.About 5 minutes later, my rolls were delivered to me and they looked delicious. \u00a0I tried the shrimp roll first and yummm was all I could think of. \u00a0I then worked on the salmon roll and bingo yummm yummm. \u00a0Once done and my bill came to $23 (coke and various taxes and charges). \u00a0Quite a steal and I will be back to try other dishes.As to the four stars I give five to the food. Service lacked a little but otherwise a great experience.",

    "text": "Being close to work and home, this place was one of my go-tos after a long hard day. This branch just reopened in January 2017 after a renovation. I usually order from the \"Chef Recommendation\" menu where you get better value for your money (they claim up to 50-60% off), and usually I don't spend more than S$20 on a filling meal here. This menu sells out FAST though, and usually the good ones are all gone by the time I arrive around 7:30pm on a weekend. Sometimes I think this is just some bait to get you in so you'll spend on their other dishes. Still, I like how the menu has plenty of variety and there are some interesting sashimi/sushi dishes that I don't commonly see elsewhere. Sometimes I'll pop by just to see what specials they have on the menu. I also really like the chawanmushi here (plain, without crab meat) ^^ smooth and straightforward with a few ingredients sprinkled about.",

The lunch options allowed a 20% discount for chawanmushi with crab meat so I tried it and was satisfied with the taste. My friends had sushi and really enjoyed their food. Unfortunately, one friend ordered ramen which was unbearably salty and she had to change it. If you download the app to make an order above $20, each person gets a free scoop of green tea ice cream! Overall quality is good but staff is very short handed.",

We ordered freely and were not impressed by any of the sushi or rolls, and ended up spending just under $50 per person. At this price point, we should have gone to Ikeikemaru.",

I've always enjoyed the salmon belly aburi sushi, and at 1.70 a pop, it doesn't get better than that! Obviously, the itacho in hongkong (where itacho originates from) is wayyy better, but I think that the sushi here is not terrible. A very convenient place to eat at if you are craving that sushi and likes variety in sushi, because they sell a whole array of raw, seared, cooked sushi and have many small seasonal dishes to keep it interesting.",

    "text": "All I've known of Itacho Sushi until I tried it yesterday was that it had an outlet at Ion with perpetually long queues (an immediate turn off for me because it means a) there's some price gimmic b) the food is good but table management is antiquated c) it's a die die must try place and I need to muster the energy, patience and hunger to go stand in line...none of which are enjoyable dining experiences to look forward to). On new year's day at 9pm, I thought maybe it would be a great idea to grab some sushi at Star Vista since it was nearby. There wasn't a queue and we got seated pretty quickly. A quick glance through the menu explained why this chain is probably popular - they have one or two items that are priced ridiculously cheap and there are \"20-50%\" offers on a product of the month. Other than that the sushi is actually pretty expensive. To put this in context, I'm the sort of person who likes eating good food that's of good value if I'm paying for it and unconcerned about the price if someone else is picking up the tab (usually for work). I therefore abhor chains like xyz-sushi/sushi-xyz that serve crap on conveyor belts and I used to frequent Sakuraya Fish Market pretty often until they started letting standards slide. Gimmicky promotions therefore don't really appeal to me and I'm looking for innovative or really fresh, well executed sushi and a filling meal for two at around $40 at a suburban location. Here's what I got...We ordered 6 pieces of the spicy lobster sushi, a tuna and chives \"roll\", an avocado and soft shell crab \"roll\", a \"crab\" meat salad, pumpkin tempura and a grilled mackerel. The \"crab\" meat salad came first and it was really a pile of un-chopped lettuce, a dollop of avocado mayo (with an emphasis on the latter) and surimi sticks. Guess I should have known eh. Next we got the sushi. The spicy lobster sushi was about $1.20 a piece and it wasn't substantial to say the least. Granted, the rice was suitably vinegared and mixed with black sesame seeds and roe, which scored innovation points, and the lobster was slathered in sauce as described... but the sushi was small. The tuna and chive roll was more balanced and didn't assault the tongue like our first sushi, but the roll consisted of 4 pieces? The last roll took the cake at 2 pieces. I thought the fish was decently fresh but not mind blowingly fresh-off-the-boat fresh like you would get with port-side sashimi joints in Japan.The pumpkin tempura was fine but again, portions were small. The grilled mackerel, a cheap and common grill dish at restaurants, was decently sized here but almost $4-5 more than what I'd pay at Sakuraya. Total bill was $60 and boy did we have to spend that amount at this supposedly cheap joint to feel full. Small point to note too is that they close at 10pm and have a strange last order policy at 9.20pm. Would I go to Itacho Sushi again? Probably not. Would I line up for \"cheap\" sushi that's limited to two pieces per customer? Err right I'm sure Oliver Twist dining went out of fashion before the stone age. Was the sushi life changing? Heck no but I'm guessing it's a step up if you're the kind who likes to eat at chain restaurants and thinks that eating food by the piece is somehow more economical.",

I like the simple, basic things: \u00a0hamachi, toro, unagi; while she wants the \"top shelf\" experience: \u00a0salmon belly, aji, uni. Hamachi is my yardstick for a good sushi place and theirs is TERRIBLE. I've tried it on two separate occasions. But I agree that the salmon belly is quite good.",
