    "text": "Ryoshi Sushi Ikeikemaru is definitely one of my top Japanese food haunts. At least weekly visits are a must and being a loyal fan, it is no wonder that the restaurant was made one of my choices for Liang Court's Oishi Food Trail.I love Ryoshi's Iced Green Tea ($1.80, free-flow) and have also tried many of their different sushi types. This time, however, I got to taste more than just the sushi with their VERY generous meal provided in conjunction with the food trail.The set at Ryoshi consisted of Salad with Prawns, 5 pieces of Nigiri Sushi (Salmon, Tamago, Ika, Maguro and Ebi), Uni-topped Beancurd, Okura Ponzu, 6 pieces of Sashimi (2 X Salmon, 2 X Maguro, 1 X Akagai and 1 X Tako), Assorted Tempura (includes Ebi, Lotus Root, Nasu Eggplant, Okra and Tuna) and a simple Dessert.As always, the sushi and sashimi were fresh and good, especially the \"Big Salmon\" sushi and Maguro Sashimi which had more tender cuts than most other sushi restaurants and melted in the mouth. The Uni-topped beancurd was amazing, no doubt due to the creamy umami provided by the sea urchin gonads. What truly stood out, however, was the Assorted Tempura.The tempura batter and sauce prepared by Ryoshi Sushi is simply outstanding, converting even a friend who does not eat fried food. The sauce was so delicious I was tempted to take a spoon to it when I have regretfully finished the rest of my Tempura. Definitely a dish I would order when I next return.For many more pictures and the full review visit voraciousappetite.wordpr\u2026",

    "text": "I'm confused.Do I like Ikeikemaru more? Or do I like Itacho more?Is Ikeikemaru cheaper? No... not really. My companion and I ended paying $40 each, which is a little less than what I'd probably have paid at Itacho for a similiar amount, but not by much. There were a lot of Japanese dining there though, which probably means that compared to the Taiwan-originating Itacho, the flavours are a lot more authentic (I guess? I didn't notice that.)Personally?Good sushi (I didn't try any sashimi). The various mackerel items, the seared salmon, the vinegared fish, I enjoyed it all and often ordered second helpings of each. They're definitely very generous with the fish, and the little rice is pretty tasty. Some items lost out to their counterparts at Itacho, and some were undeniably better. This place definitely does aburi much better, and all the items get a good, solid sear. And while I enjoyed \u00a0I can't shake the feeling that Ikeikemaru is a little overrated.It's not as cheap as everyone makes it out to be (in my opinion), and while it's good, solid sushi, it's also not revolutionary. I think Ikeikemaru completely blows places like Sushi Tei and Sakae Sushi out of the water, but frankly, I don't understand how those places haven't closed down to begin with. This place is a solid, reliable option for sushi, and I'll definitely be back.But is it \"the best budget sushi place in town\"? I can't really say yes.",

    "text": "If my guess is correct, it is the exact sushi shop from Shizuoka. The space where Ryoshi now stands used to change tenants a lot but I guess the business here is so good that it is going to stay for long. The Jizakama Rayu (fish seasoned in chilli oil) is as mild as it looks while the Fuwafuwa Tamago is creamy but bland.I guessed we were in better luck when we ordered the recommended items like the Nama Shirasu ($5.80). The overflowing amount of raw whitebait was a pleasant sight that no one would complain that it's too much. But the large piece of eel in Daimyo Anago($5.80) shown below failed to impress the eyes and the taste buds. It needs more sun-tanning.Notice the absence of raw fish? That is because we prefer to have it as plain sashimi but they did not have it. Nonetheless, this did not disappoint as their non-sushi items were actually tastier! Salmon salad ($8.60) is drizzled in bright and tangy dressing while the Fried Oysters ($6.80) are plump, juicy and cheap. The Pumpkin Croquette $4.80 was another of our hot favourite because it was not simply pur\u00e9ed pumpkin but also contain pumpkin bits. Served piping hot, they did require some self-discipline to not bite into them immediately but worth the wait.....",

Large pieces of fish w little rice. Mm. Aburi salmon was delicious! Friend loved the aburi cheese ebi. Whole anago was pretty gd (although I think itacho sushi's could give this one a run for its money, bigger slice for $6.50 as compared to $6.80 here).Lots of aburi choices, my fav!Vinegared mackerel was pretty gd. Engawa (fluke fin) was new to me but apparently a sushi standard so wanted to try it out. Texture reminded me somewhat of squid, interesting..Anyway, really good quality sushi and in all cost ~$16! Will definitely be back for more :)",

It's run by mostly Japanese, and on top of the usual sushi menu, served the old school conveyor belt style, they always have a ton of seasonal fish and even fresh wasabi and home-made desserts. The fish quality is pretty comparable to Itacho, but you get a lot more variety, and it makes you feel just a little closer to Japan.",

Hubby swooned over the otoro nigiri and enjoyed the oysters. With the sushi train right in front, it really is a test of your discipline and willpower! Our dinner wasn't as cheap as in the other reviews (almost $100 for the two of us and no alcohol!) but I guess that goes back to the point on discipline and willpower! Haha",

    "text": "Absolutely wonderful. Don't be fooled by the conveyor belt into thinking its some crappy sushi chain like Sakae Sushi and the like. No this is true authentic Japanese sushi, with Japanese staff and a Japanese sushi chef, the experience truly is authentic. The sushi itself is wonderful, fresh and generous cuts of fish. Pricing wise its extremely affordable when compared to restaurants like Tampopo upstairs.The best deal i would recommend is getting the Tempura Udon with a Sushi Set add-on. At around $15 ($9 udon, $6 add-on for sushi) its definitely worth it, especially since there's no service charge and GST (if I remember correctly). The tempura udon comes with 3 Ebi Tempura (a rarity since most places only give 1) with one of the best bowls if udons I've ever had. The soup borth for the udon is fragrant and delicious while the homemade udon is definitely different from your standard Udon as its thin rather than fat. The smooth texture of the udon with the tasty soup broth makes it one of the top Udon in Singapore.The $6.80 add-on for the sushi set is definitely one of the most value-for-money deals out there. At $6.80 you can get a mediocre plate of sushi at Sakar Sushi (:/) But here, you can a variety of seven sushi. Salmon, Tuna, Squid, Mackerel (or Sardine), Egg, Ebi (Prawn), Beancurd skin Sushi. The salmon and tuna sushi were the best I've eaten in a long time, the fish is very fresh, the cut of fish is thick and you can taste the natural sweetness of the fish. The rice is also moist and fluffy unlike another chain (Sushi Tei) The sushi is definitely one of the best around and definitely one of the cheapest around with its authentic taste, presentation and freshness of ingredients.I would definitely recommend this place to sushi lovers. Although its been only open for less than a month, its usually packed during dinner. Though there hasn't been queues yet, the restaurant is usually full house.",

Firstly, I was put off by this waitress who told me to look for the sushi that I wanted from the conveyor belt instead of ordering straight from them. secondly, she was put off by the fact that I was carrying some durians which I sealed in a container, tied with a plastic bag and stored inside a paperbag. Basically there were hardly any smell detected but then I guess she must have a very sharp nose and told us not to eat the durians in the restaurant. Oh please! Why would I do that? Thirdly, the uni gunkan maki sushi was not fresh coz it taste bit bitter and sourish. However, I do like their aburi cheese ebi.

Although it was a weekday lunch, the place was packed easily. There was reasonable price lunch set menu, but most were having ala carte. Hot green tea was chargeable at S$1.80++ and was refillable.Kaisen Don Set (S$33++)Served with soup & saladI was kind of surprised to see sea urchin in the dish, as I remembered that the staff who took my order, told me that sea urchin was not available and would be replaced by otoro (fatty tuna). The raw seafood was quite fresh.Mentaiko Scallop Sushi (S$6.80++)It was taken off the rotating conveyor belt. As it was black plate, it was priced S$6.80++ a plate. The rich creamy sauce on the silky juicy scallop was a match.Kaki Fried (S$8.60++)The deep fried oyster was served with mayonnaise by the side. Encased with a thin crispy crust, it was juicy inside, with juicy dipping when bite.",

I walked in at 7:30pm which i thought was not very late.I'm not a fan of conveyor belt sushi (unless I absolutely have to) so I ordered salmon aburi from the menu thinking I would get a fresh one this way. However, i'm pretty sure they just served one right off the conveyor belt anyways. The rice was tough and had dried on the sides. Gross!!!To add more, the rest of the sushi items were served with incorrect temperature (too cold) rendering nearly all of the fish tasteless. It makes me really sad when fish die and their death is wasted on sub-par meal.AND the worst part - the chawanmushi was too salty. How could they, as a japanese restaurant, mess up good ol' chawanmushi??FYI I have been here three times and the quality keeps dropping on each visit. First visit about two years ago was pleasant. Second visit, the waiter blamed me for not checking the bill before she rang up the register (Was it my job to ensure items billed are correct? How about billing the right items in the first place?). Third visit is what I described above.So based on this trend, I won't be coming back. It was not a pleasant experience for $30-40 per person price tag.",

The fish was definitely too cold and this blunted the taste. Some of them definitely did not seem fresh. The rice was hard and dried along the sides. I've had good sushi but then again, I've had Ikeikemaru Ryoshi. Next time I'm craving for cheap conveyer belt sushi, I'm heading back to Genki.",

A rare find in these days of bloated menus and wacko out there sushi (by which I am definitely referring to the mediocre absurdities found at sakae, sushi tei and regrettably ichiban boshi). Food quality is decent - sashimi is fresh and not so cold as to offer an convincing impression of a meaty ice cube. Sushi rice is properly vinegared. Again, and very tragically, a rare offering these days. That said, sakuraya still holds the crown for nearly-alive sashimi freshness, at least among local sushi chains. Docking a couple stars for the surly service (yes its Singapore but still one must have standards), and the really awful iPad ordering system - truly no due consideration to us plebs who have to actually use the damn thing. UX designers, there's a business opportunity for you in designing these iPad ordering system thingies. All in, a decent place for sushi, and that's saying something considering the good selection in Liang Court (or Singapore for that matter). Will come again.",

It is located on the basement floor in the grocery store eating area, far in a back corner to the right. Once inside you will be impressed by the approachable Japanese staff and the mile long conveyer belt. Take a seat and get comfy. It's sushi time!For having dropped only $20 on a respectable amount of sushi, Ikeikemaru wins points in my book. While everyone can't seem to get enough of the aburi salmon, it was my least favorite plate. Living on the US west coast, we are salmon snobs. The salmon was fine, just nothing to rave about. The katsuo, on the otherhand, was to die for. Super fresh with great texture. Could have eaten 3 plates, easily. The tamago was another standout. I'm a huge fan of basic ingredients treated in time honored ways. The tamago is made fresh in house, and the balance of mirin against the creamy egg was spot on. So good. Ikeikemaru Ryoshi has definitely made its way into the quick and easy dinner rotation list!",

    "text": "Chanced upon this restaurant for dinner while shopping at Westgate with a friend. It was not crowded which was good enough for me in comparison to the popular brand names like Tim Ho Wan and Ding Tai Feng which were, needless to say, decorated with long queues on a Sat night.This place is mainly for sushi. Concept is typical of a conveyor belt sushi bars we've probably all been to before- However, a distinguishing factor would probably be the sushi chefs doing their thing at the island where customers can watch them work while we eat. Friend and I initially ordered a Udon + don set each, which comes with a mini don (mine was a maguro set with japanese pickles and fermented soya beans- very reminiscent of the Japanese rice breakfasts I had in Japan!). I was also pleasantly surprised by the udon which isnt the normal thick noodle you would get, but a much thinner version. Sets were really worth the price- $13.40.We probably would not have ordered the sets if we had known just how delish the sushi would be. We tried various types like the ike (white squid), which was a huge white piece of squid on a smaller rice. I really liked how they dont use too much rice in their sushi so you can eat more without feeling too full. Also a must try is their ABURI SALMON sushi which was so fantastic we ordered another portion.Service is great- perhaps because the staff were really Japanese! We were served promptly and politely by all the staff, although they were busy cleaning up by then as it was rather late and close to closing time. Highly recommended and a must try for all Japanese food enthusiasts.",

What attracted me was the Bara chirashi when I was queuing for a space to seat.Was seated quite quickly as we chose to seat outdoors. The indoor seats were quickly filled up. - Wednesday night Looking at the overall interior design, I enjoy the materials they use. Soft coloured materials which were pleasing to the eyes. There were a table with half sofa and half chair. I sat myself on the end of the sofa.Ordered the food on the touch screened tablet. Food came much earlier than expected.First dish to arrive was the salmon sashimi. It is fresh but not cold enough. 6 pieces for $5.80. Not too bad for the price I guess.Then my friends' ramen arrived. It seemed that they enjoyed their food as there wasn't any ingredients left on their bowls.Next was the Bara Chirashi. I ordered the smaller bowl but it came in a bigger portion than I expected. The sashimi was fresh. I like the mixture of seaweed, salmon roe, a few types of sashimi, cucumber in cube forms. Like I mentioned earlier, I prefer it to be much colder than it should. But overall it was tasty and delicious.Drink wise I ordered ice lemon tea. I like the home made blend of the ice lemon tea. Is very refreshing :)Overall, it was a good choice - price and food was much better than expected. Will be there again in the future :)",

BIZARRE. I've tried so many different kinds here now, and I don't mean tamago/inari/tuna mayo-style, but otoro, maguro, ika, aji, hamachi, and loads more I don't remember or can't pronounce. And each piece has what feels like a pinky-sized portion of rice, to a whopper of a slice of fish. It's hard not to taste the awesomeness of the fish, or see the value in what you're getting. Prices are ridiculous for this quality, and in a good way. And that's made the experience all the better!",

    "text": "As I've mentioned in previous reviews, my ability to eat inferior sushi in Singapore has definitely taken a hit since I returned to Japan after a long absence.I'll confess. I've never paid more than $150 per head for Japanese food. I've paid more than this for non-Japanese food but I've never been to one of these super amazeballs $400 a head sushi joints like Shini by Kanesaka or Tetsuya's or what have you. It's on the to-do list, trust me. But until then, the sushi I ate at a tiny joint called Kouraku in Nakameguro/Daikanyama area, Tokyo (check it out if you're in town) is the yardstick for any and all other sushi.So Ikeikemaru was obviously no Kouraku. But it wasn't bad, I guess. I understand that they get their sushi flown in on Tuesdays and Thursdays so maybe Sunday wasn't the best day to go. Having said this, the daimyo anago was pretty great and the salmon was competent, as was the aji.What was disappointing? The chu-toro which tasted less fresh and not as well cut, and the uni which tasted like some kind of citrus fruit.Bottom line is, this is the sort of quality you would expect while paying $50 a head for sushi in Singapore. It doesn't blow anyone's mind but it's better than many other, crappier sushi joints.By the way, for the record, I gotta say that I dig ordering directly via iPad.",
