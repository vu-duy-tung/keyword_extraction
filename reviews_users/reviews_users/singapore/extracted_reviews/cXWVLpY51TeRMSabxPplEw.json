I think even that is pretty pricey for the kind of cake they have. I only liked the signature fruit cake.The other cakes were a bit dry and not sweet enough (maybe I'm used to eating overly sweet American cakes).",

The best part is that the roll is much cheaper than the other items, albeit the overall prices are not cheap. The cheese cake and matcha cake are also great. The cream and strawberries are fresh. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the desserts here. :)",

    "text": "Greeting you at the entrance of the cafe are the two cake displays filled with tall chiffon cakes.They disappear quickly but they are also replenished pretty quickly. Their best sellers are the matcha chiffon cake and the matcha roll.It is a NETT priced cafe, but it is also self service. So whilst you order and pay for your food at the cashier, get a friend to head inside the long cafe, to find seats.1. Matcha Chiffon Cake $7I'll be honest, for a chiffon cake, $7 is really pricey. The chiffon cake itself is very light, however the butter cream all over the cake, tasted very cheesey. The cheesey taste was unexpected and I am not sure if everyone would like it. It was more like a cheesecake + matcha chiffon cake. 2. Chocolate Chiffon Cake $7The chocolate chiffon cake was more enjoyable than the Matcha Chiffon Cake, the chocolate cream was so delightable, I devoured it in no time.Would I come back here for more of these $7 chiffon cakes? No, why? Because they're $7! But it was an interesting experience. I may come back to try the matcha roll though.",

    "text": "I don't recommend the coffee.I have no opinion on the food, but it doesn't look particularly amazing.In short? Order anything with cream.Those cream puffs are like little pockets of magic, stuffed to the brim with tasty, light, fluffy dreams. Don't bite into one because you'll find yourself a little messy. Instead, be deliberate, calm, patient.Break open the puff, separate it. Don't spill the filling. Put down one half, and then slowly bite into the other. Savour the texture of the puff, then let yourself be carried along by the silky lusciousness of that cream filling. Taste it. Luxuriate. Swallow.Repeat. Blush because you realise you're making embarrassing noises while you wallow in this little morsel of sin. Continue eating anyway.When you're done licking your lips, and your fingers, and wishing you'd bought one more...BUY ONE MORE. And do it all over again.Side note: the strawberry shortcake and blueberry cheese tart are both also delicious. I like the blueberry more than the shortcake, I find that Canele's shortcake is still better, but man.Have I mentioned the cream puff?",

    "text": "Been here two times already! Both visits for desserts :)I really love the pudding here. My favourite ones are the milk pudding (which comes with caramel sauce) and coffee pudding (comes with creamer). Not something you can easily find, and it's really smooth and wobbly. I was a little disappointed with the cake though. Tried the special called 'Rose Chiffon', the colour was nice, had a cream cheese frosting, but it tasted a tad too normal. And of course, the slice of chiffon cake cost a tad too much. Anyway my friend ate a main course on the second visit and said it was bad. The pork was too dry! I guess I'll still stick to my desserts.",

The other of my all time favorite is their handmade warabi mochi. It is done just nice with the right amount of sweetness. It is soft yet chewy.We loved the milk pudding so much that we often have it takeaway and slowly enjoy it at home.",

    "text": "Those cream puffs? More like cream bombs! Every bite squishes cream right out, and thank goodness it's bloody delicious cream, otherwise I'd be a right idiot licking my fingers with every bite.I'm also a fan of the fruit roll, which is really a cake roll with fruit in it, but I'm not complaining. Soft, pillowy sponge, with fruit and cream in between - if I wasn't watching my waistline (goodbye metabolism, le sigh), they'd be a once-a-week staple. Thankfully my wallet is in agreement with the waistline, so I don't go by too often.Then again there's lots more to ogle after - I hear the milk puddings are rather yum too.",

There is another reason to pay them a visit - Dulcet & Studio.Dulcet & Studio is a whole new lifestyle caf\u00e9, with a contemporary yet cosy vibes - think Muji in a restaurant form. The name 'Dulcet' means sweet to the taste, while 'Studio' is the other part of the caf\u00e9 where customers can sign up for cooking classes. Expect a mixture of Western meets Japanese cuisine including specialty pasta, lamb rice, beef spare rib stew, fish & chip. Lunch and dinner sets are served at a very reasonable price of below $15 and $20 respectively.I much preferred the Black Pig Bolognese Fettuccine Pasta ($12.80) which reminds me of tomato based bak chor mee pok. The meat sauce is salty-sweet, and ladies would appreciate this as it does not leave you overwhelmed or over-full for lunch.",
