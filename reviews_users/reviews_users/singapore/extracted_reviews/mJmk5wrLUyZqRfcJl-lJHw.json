The tea tasted so smooth and the pearls were really 'Q' and chewy. Koi began with only one outlet at Toa Payoh a few years ago, and now there are several outlets and the one at Bugis+ is definitely one of the most popular ones.But the question is, is it worth the queue? The queue at Bugis+ outlet is almost always very long. The wait can be about 10-15min. To be honest, this isn't a very long wait for a delicious drink that you can indulge in once in a while, but what I am most disappointed with is the service at this outlet. My friends and I had bad experiences at this outlet. The aunties at the counter are pretty hostile and arrogant. There was once my friend made a minor mistake in ordering because she mixed up the name of the drink and sugar level with the other one offered by another popular bubble tea chain, and was given condescending remarks. Even though the drink at Koi is delicious, such bad service is unacceptable. Avoid this outlet!",

I particularly like this outlet as although sometimes the queue can be pretty long, like all other koi outlets who put service as their priority, the staff would come out of the counter to take orders. Even if the staff doesn't do that, the queue still manages to clear quite fast and customers just have to wait a maximum of 10minutes or less to get a thirst quenching drink. I have been to other outlets and the queue is long too but the waiting time can go up to 20-30 minutes which is madness. I like their variety of drinks and coffees, and particularly the bubble milk tea which is the most basic drink there. The tea just tastes so natural and once you try the tea from this stall you wouldn't want to buy any other bubble tea from other stall cause they just don't taste that good anymore. The yakult green tea and black tea macchiato are also must tries.",
