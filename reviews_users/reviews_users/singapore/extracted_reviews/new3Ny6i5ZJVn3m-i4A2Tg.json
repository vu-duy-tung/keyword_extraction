I would give 3.5 stars overall if possible but round up for the nice and chic design.",

    "text": "I arrived at assembly ground on a weekday evening and it was relatively empty with a few groups of people enjoying cups of coffee. While I know their coffee is recommended, I've never been a huge fan of coffee. So, I hesitated ordering a cup expecting my coffee addict of a boyfriend to order one that I can try a tiny bit of. However, he surprised me by ordering a pint...a latte it was for me, and a good thing I did too. The coffee was a good blend in my opinion, less acidic and with a great robust flavour. The milk tasted somewhat creamy which made me slightly suspicious but all in all, it was a good drink. My friend also seemed to thoroughly enjoy her ice chocolate, for those who don't particularly like coffee. I had the coney dog, while my boyfriend had the blackened tuna burger and my friend ordered the beef ragout with rosti. I wouldn't say it was spectacular, just a regular frankfurter it seems with a slightly sweeter than expected beef chilli but it fulfilled my chilli dog craving and as such, I'd give it 3 stars. The remaining star comes from the fact that my companions seemed to quite enjoy their food and the decent portions, and we were served by an exceptionally friendly waiter, who was key to our whole experience being delightful overall. To that waiter, you might think you're just doing your job but thank you for doing it so well!",

    "text": "I didn't try their coffee, so no comment on that. This is a review on their The Assembly Wagyu Burger ($24.50). I don't really like beef, but I ordered their wagyu burger nonetheless cos I heard some good reviews about it. I am so glad that I did take a chance cos their wagyu burger was really good. All the burgers menu was served with sesame brioche bun + spiced fries. The sesame brioche bun was very very good. It was toasted with just enough butter, and it was still warm though it had been sitting for more than 10 mins after being served. Since it comes with fries, so for girls, you might have some difficulty to finish this dish. I came there HUNGRY (it was past 12 pm and I haven't eaten anything since morning) and yet I couldn't finish the dish. But I guess being served too much food is better than being served too little food, right? ;pAbout the wagyu beef patty it was very thick - however texture wise it was perfect. I could easily cut & chew it with no problem at all. No complains. Taste wise it was very good as well. It was juicy and just right salty. Though I really like this dish overall very much, I can testify that the fries (though also tasted good) but was loaded with lots of MSG (I got very very thirsty afterwards) drinking like 6 cups of water total. So if you were on diet, it's probably a good idea to just skip the fries and go straight to the burger. My hubby got Ragout of Beef with Rosti (S$23). Based on the menu description, it was slow-roasted angus, rosti, trio of mushrooms, onion jam, creamed spinach, & 62C egg. When it came to our table, the smell was very nice and tempting. However when it comes to the taste, the beef was very lacking. In conclusion, if you're feeling to eat smth beef-y, I vote for the wagyu beef burger all the way!Last but not least the place has ample seating space. They also offer free wifi for customers, however when I tried it (Assembly 1) it doesn't work... :/ [came here on July 11]",

Revisiting this place after about a year, I was disappointed by how far the quality had fallen. I had their set meal - chicken skewers with aglio olio pasta which came with the soup of the day and a choice of drink. The soup of the day was pumpkin- way too sweet although the texture was nice. The main was... a joke. The pasta was barely enough for my 15 year old nephew and parts of the chicken were undercooked. On a more positive note, some of my friends who ordered the ala carte said their food was good. Avoid their set meals at all costs.",

We were seated at the long table in the back, which had 3-4 trays of what appeared to be the remnants of the staff lunch on the other half of it. Also, it seemed to be their unofficial break area, which just didn't give us the relaxing vibe we were looking for. As for the food, some dishes were better than others. The calamari could have come from a convenience pack, and the hae bi hiam pasta was dry and had one measly shrimp. The chicken burger was good though, and the truffle carbonara tasty though pricey for what was essentially a meatless dish with cheap mushrooms (shimeji & shitake). There was also unfortunately a hair in my iced latte.",

That is the standout dish as most other things are pretty average. They serve coffee from Nylon so the beans are clearly of good quality and they are pretty decent and making the coffee here but by no means the best place in town. If you are however in the area this is a good place to go for your caffeine fix.They have free wifi and it can be nice to sit and slack in the sofas by the entrance for a while before heading out for more shopping.

The pizzas are thin crusted and i really enjoy the duck and arugula pizza. Good for about 3 pax to share together with a serving of a side to add variety to the meal. The idea of truffle fries is always very appealing. Lightly salted with truffle salt, that's pretty much they have to offer here at The Assembly Ground. Not the best that I have tasted, really just enough to give you a good whiff of the truffle on regular fries.More food to try, I hope to be back soon.",

Food is tasty and decent quality, though rather small portioned. The beef cheek was tender, though I would've preferred it in more of a \"ragu\" style rather than in chunks. I'm not sure why shiitake mushrooms were used - it didn't go quite so well. The pasta was apparently house made and quite nice. Chicken leg was well seasoned and tasty but potatoes were under-seasoned. Overall not bad but without the Entertainer discount, I don't think it would've been worth he price.",

    "text": "The coffee is 4-star but the food is miserable so 3 star it is. The place is crowded on weekends and you can leave your name and contact number if you wish to wait for one. They will call you once a table frees up. On weekdays it gets crowded during lunch time but it is not horribly noisy that you cannot hear yourself think. The place decor is typical of so many others with a bit of industrial look and with wooden furnishings. Still a nice place for a cup of coffee, but not necessary a comfortable place to chill with a book. The food menu looks appetizing, unfortunately the sandwich I had was pathetic (see pics). There was so little meat that you could count the small pieces dotting the bread. No wonder I thought I was just eating two slices of bread. Maybe it was a one- off time but I did not go back to try again.",

They usually have 2 taps of Archipelago's small batch beer, which is a perfect pre- (or post-) movie drink. The desserts are good, too. I love their sticky date pudding. And I've been told that their coffee is quite nice...It's been popular every time I've been there, so it gets a bit noisy for my taste. But I'm an old guy, so consider the source. ;-)",

    "text": "Edit: deleted a star because a $8 cup of iced latte seriously should not be that tiny! I guess I'm paying for this little dainty sprig of flowers in an empty lemonade jar on my table. I'd rather head to Starbucks right across next time I think. Came here to chill for a few hours before a movie, and loved the experience! Can't speak to the food which some other reviews comment negatively on, but I'll be back next time for coffee & to chat with friends. The ambiance and design is the hipster/woody style and I loved it - tables are placed a comfortable distance away, and the staff don't make you feel uncomfortable for just whiling away a few hours here. They have free wifi & iced water & many tables. It's the type of cafe I've seen at more inaccessible places like Tiong Bahru and Tanjong Pagar, so I'm very glad this is so close to a major MRT station! We ordered 1 for 1 iced cooler promotion ($5 for both), honey cabana & osmanthus. Both were served in mason jars & looked very thin and watery but quite tasty and light! Very refreshing. Also shared brownies, a popular item on the menu according to the friendly staff, which were delicious ($6.50). I was craving a coffee so I also ordered an iced latte ($8), which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream inside. I was a little disappointed about the size of this - it's a small glass maybe 8oz? (Def smaller than the Tall at Starbucks). But the coffee was strong and good. The baked goods at the counter (not in the refrigerater) are freshly homemade: selections included Thai milk tea cake, brownies, citrus loaf, and they looked very good!!",

I didnt quite enjoy the dish(could do with more garlic and seasoning) but my partner enjoyed my leftovers.My group shared Truffle Fries which was more satisfying than the above. The cafe offers a variety of cakes and tarts though the menu doesnt state so.The takeback of this visit would be if you order a burger, it comes with a free pint! Do check with the server on the validity of the promo.",

The Spicy Sausage pasta was delicious and did not taste spicy at all. The beef Chilli on the hand was just okay. Its a partial service eatery, you have to place your order at the cashier and they will serve your dishes. You can help yourself to some water at the far end of the cafe.Lovely ambience to chill with friends. The promotion makes it affordable to dine there, without the promotion not quite sure if it's worth it.",

Price is pretty reasonable. Didn't get to try the coffee that everyone seems to rave about as we were not up for caffeine, but the facilities/coffee machine looks amazing + barista seems professional even with our drinks (camomile honey lemon tea + green tea latte that comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream).Can't stop popping the pop corn chicken and the assembly brunch's cheesy potato layer is simply addictive. Definitely recommend for people who just wanna chill in a caf\u00e9 on a lazy afternoon.",
