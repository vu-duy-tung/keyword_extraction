    "text": "Loved it! Still not sure what's different between hot pot and steamboat, but I recommend this restaurant for their steamboat experience.You first pick 2 from 5 different soups: we picked siswan spicy soup and yam and mushrooms soup as these are the two most popular. This forms a base of cost at little under SGD30. Next you can order appetizers (fried soft shell crab yum), and then pick from various options of meats, seafood, vegetables, noodles, each individually priced. If you're not paying attention it will add up quickly. Set option is also available at under SGD50. We choose our own opinions and the only one I would skip next time is Japanese premium beef because it's so expensive yet when dipped in hot soup it's just over cooked and you can't tell a difference.I loved all the options we ordered: 3 kinda of mushrooms, bok choi, bamboo, shrimp dumplings, glass noodles, grouper, and many meats. I would also skip scallops next time.After you place an order you then go and \"build your sauce \", our waitress did it for us and it was an amazing mix of sauce, garlic, sesame seeds, peanuts, shallots, and cilantro.You cook your food in the soup, then dip into sauce, then eat. Despite all the food, we ordered dessert because we saw sesame peanuts dumplings on the dessert menu. This is my favorite Asian dessert that recently overtook glutinous rice desserts. The service was outstanding: our waitress helped us with everything after we told her it was our first time.20% discount for guests of the hotel.",

So despite the Ala Carte discount card that gives very good discount, I decided not to patronise this restaurant again.Here only because it is a reunion lunch Organised by an ex-colleague.Service was okay as we were in a room and a Long time senior waitress took our order.Appetiser - fried fish. Looked like fried carrot cake.Yu Sheng - good.Abalone soup - good.Suckling pig was huge. The skin was good and the meat fried with salt & pepper was excellent; best that I've had.Huge steamed batang fish - some of us liked it but not me.Mixed vegetables with my Favourite lily bulb- nice.Mee sua (noodles) with 2 kind of large prawns in soup - very nice soup.Overall a very satisfying lunch.

    "text": "This establishment is a stalwart on the Chinese restaurant scene here. We came here on a Sunday morning at 11am, a party of 3 adults and 1 toddler. The seat for this toddler didn't have a belt and a table, so parents, take note. Reservations best be booked early, if you want to enjoy a leisurely Sunday here.We ordered a multitude of things, and everything was of an acceptable standard (or better), and I am hard-pressed to find an item I remotely dislike. Special mention to the puff pastry with scallop (1), baked mango chicken tart (2), liu sha bao (3), and prawn toast (4). 1. I don't like puff pastry anything, but the garlic-scallop filling within... Um. I guess I do like puff pastry after all?2. Mango chicken tart; doesn't sound like much, but with a \"polo bun\" crust, chicken pie filling, mango to set it all off... That's a party in my mouth right there.3. The custard really flowed, with grainy bits of salted egg yolk. Thumbs up!4. It looks like an ordinary fried item, but this is elevated fried finger food. Yum!My only grouse with this place is that pork cheek is a cut of meat ill-suited for char siew, as it was slightly chewy and not as tender. I do wish they used the shoulder or just plain ol' belly. Special thanks to fellow Yelper Lynne N for the treat! P.S. They are understaffed, but they really make an effort here.",

    "text": "Such an unfortunate experience. Had been staying at Orchard Hotel all week and finally decided to try this restaurant which was highly recommended and had just gone through a major renovation. The venu was lovely and has a modern/elegant decor. Unfortunately we were seated and then ignored. We mused as we watched people come in after us and have servers flock to place napkins in laps, provide moist towels and menus...my partner and I were the only Anglos in the restaurant, however, having never experienced any form of racism while here in Singapore I still find it hard to believe it was a contributing factor. Nonetheless, we watched other tables receive drinks and finally their first course before finally gaining the attention of one of the 6 wait staff standing idly. He came to our table and said sorry... and gave us one menu...which we shared... and then went on to wait 10 more minutes before finally agreeing there was definitely an issue. As we were leaving several of the idle wait staff seemed to come to life and moved in our direction but we had no intention of prolonging what had been our single solitary poor experience while dining in Singapore. \u00a0If anyone in the restaurant-management comes across this review, please work on your staff training as it is crucial for a restaurant aspiring to be a fine dining venu.",

There were at least 3 service staff visible. It took 10 minutes to get a menu. After waiting an additional 10 minutes, watching other tables being served, we left. It was obvious they were not interested in our business. Sad but true. With all the great Singapore food options, it's not worth going here and risking poor service.",

She told me after, that she only emailed them what she wanted. When we arrived they gave some signals to her and brought out the candle-lit cake just before we asked for a bill. That was pretty awesome.The only downside, well, I don't know why but the staffs just have to bring food to their \"prep\" table before serving, making the restaurant look busy all the time even if there are only a few customers.",

After years of not eating here, I've re-visited the place and I think it is better than before.Hua Ting is well known for its dim sum, but this visit was for dinner. The dishes were all excellent, but particularly outstanding is the Roast duck. Crisp skin, devoid of fat between skin and meat, it was pure heaven.However, dessert was a bit of a letdown. I had the black rice with ice cream. The coconut in which it was served was rather leathery.But of note are the high quality local staff who can communicate in both English and Mandarin, unlike some other restaurants. Plus, the waitresses are very helpful and look really happy to be part of the establishment. I don't know who they've got training over there. But he/she is doing an excellent job.",

White tablecloths, fancy china, excellent service, it's your typical atas restaurant without being too overpriced and/or snobby. Everything we got here was pretty yummy from their roast meats to their actual dim sum, my favorite being the Salted Egg Custard Pau (but that's one of my fav dim sum items in general so potentially a little bias). I can't say anything stood out significantly but this place is definitely up there with the rest of the good hotel dim sum restaurants in Singapore.I will definitely be back.",

The baked mango with chicken tart completely won my jaded dim sum palate over, and the mixed platter (roast duck and two other items I forget) was excellent, as was the baked silver cod with honey. The mango pomelo dessert was decent, but the egg white puffs with durian were quite disappointing, according to those who tried it.Service: Excellent!Ambience: Great place for business lunch.
