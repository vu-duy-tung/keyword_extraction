    "text": "My husband and I went to Park for the first time a few days ago with our two young daughters, and we were all happily surprised. It is rare that we can find a restaurant that fills all of our requirements, as my husband is vegan and the kids and I are vegetarian (not to mention the fact that our kids are picky eaters!). However, it was a home run for all of us! The kids loved the truffle fries and the truffle macaroni and cheese, as well as the juice; I enjoyed the fantastic caprese salad, and my husband enjoyed a grilled vegetable sandwich. The location is great, the wine and beer prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was very pleasant. We will definitely be back again, though we live rather far away near Bedok Reservoir. I wish they would open another location close to us! However, in the meantime, we will keep making the trip over as the food and atmosphere are worth it.",

Sure- maybe they were reserved... but we weren't even asked for a name. Honestly felt like we weren't \"good enough\" or something for them. Disgusted at the lack of service. Will not be back.",

The food in general is not too exciting in terms of concept, but what they have are well executed and delicious through Park's own interpretations. Portions are always substantial and good value for money. \u00a0My own and family favourites are the spam chips and truffle fries for sharing, omega 3 salad for some greens, the burgers- Thai chicken, vegetarian and Park burger (with the blue cheese is good!), Mac and cheese.",

The burger was as good as the omakase burger I had the previous week.. Except I couldn't finish the buns on this one. Ribs were very nicely marinated (in Guinness Stout no less!) and came in a very generous portion. We could barely finish everything and had a tub of fries left over. Worth a second visit to try their other items..",

The food was well made and good. \u00a0I thought it was very good actually considering it was such a casual atmosphere. \u00a0I had a seafood salad. \u00a0The dressing was a little bland but its more a matter of personal choice. I also had a chicken breast with pureed spinach that was pretty tasty. \u00a0I like that the chicken wasnt over cooked and dry. \u00a0They have a great menu and I definitely have to go back for the truffle mac and cheese. \u00a0The service was great and the staff were really friendly. \u00a0Definitely much better food than most the bars in HV. \u00a0I think its my new go to spot in HV for drinks and food.",
