    "text": "Good burgers, freshly made from fresh ingredients, but be careful of the long wait. I'm being generous with the 4 stars, should only be a 3 half. I wouldn't mind eating it again, but not with the long wait. The standard cheese burgers are good. Very good. I can't say i have tasted them, but judging by how quickly the kids walloped them, without letting me have a bite, they must have been very good. The speciality burger they have is the buah keluak burger. It's a bit of an enigma though. They have minced the chicken, curry, and buah keluak into a patty. Very clever, very innovative. It is served in a soft hamburger bun with chap chai as the garnish. Again very clever, very fusion. The first bite is a delight, as the sheer novelty of it surprises you. The flavour of the buah keluak is accurate, worthy of any Peranakan. The 2nd bite is still okay. But that's where my interests starts to waiver. Some how as a burger, it just doesn't work. Perhaps it's the richness of the flavour, or the heaviness of it. It just didn't make a good burger, and I didn't enjoy it. Will be sticking to the standard burgers next time.",

Other extras like salad, cheese, bacon & patty cost $1 to $2.50. Be prepared to wait for as long as a half hour without the AC. I had a classic beef without the extra stuff to see for myself if it was worth it compared to other burgers that cost more than an $100 bucks. My final verdict? Best in the world! For all those foodie out there, come quick...",

    "text": "An interesting name given to a stall that reminds me of the childhood days whereby the word \"HamBaoBao\" when translated from Mandarin literally refers to Hamburger. I guess during my era, any kid will be very happy to hear about this word.I was in fact looking forward to the Ayam Buah Keluak Burger but just too bad that it was sold out during the time of vist and we was given a keychain to wait for our food.Be prepared to wait a little longer if you are ordering the crispy Pork Belly burger as the pork belly will be cooked base on order basis. The pork belly was well marinated and was definitely tasty in its crispy skin layer. Mustard was added to the pork belly to give a spicy kick while the refreshing cool slices of cucumber strike a good balance to burger. Another highlight was its fluffy light butter grilled burger buns which was deliciously good.Crispy Pork Belly - $5The Classic Beef burger was not too bad either with beef patty, cheese, homemade tomato sauce, pickles as well as lettuce. Buns were similar prepared with butter just like any other burgers in the menu,The Classic Beef - $5It was good to see young local faces in the hawkers nowadays taking up the challenge working longer hours. Food is rather comforting with innovations of creating burger out of the ordinary and price wise, I would consider pocket friendly.Fred not if you are caught in the queue and need to ease your hunger quick, there are few other stalls like Top 1 Homemade Noodle, Penang Home Made Beef Ball, Feng Ji Shu Shi Char Kway Teow that you might not want to miss out.",

    "text": "This is a surprising modern find among the ancient food court ruins above Beauty World. For $5-7, you can get a freshly grilled burger and fries set that crushes McDonald's in price and quality. There are a few types of burgers, so you can get pork, beef, or chicken. You can get ingredients added or removed without trouble.I tried the traditional beef burger. It was grilled nicely and the the ingredients were fresh. They also grill the bun to give everything a nice crunch. In addition, I recommend the hand cut fries as a tasty complement to any sandwich. The downside is the long wait time of about 20 minutes for a single burger, so expect to stay for a while.",

To be fair they tell you up front and give you good estimates as to when your burger will be ready. Also, the burger patty tends to be dry. Had it twice and both times the burger was dry. The second time, it was also over salted. Fish was flaky but the salt overpowered the taste. Again, they are well-priced. So... you decide.",

Personally I love the fish burger. It's fantastic with that roasted pepper flavour which makes it just perfect. Ayam Buah Kulak is for sure not for everybody but not bad in my opinion. Fries? Addictive. Simple, homemade with skin on. Love it. It's at a hawker so be prepared for the heat and at peak periods the wait can be quite a while but hey, it's worth it.",
