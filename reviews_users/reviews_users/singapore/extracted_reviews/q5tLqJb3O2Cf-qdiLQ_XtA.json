    "text": "This was an unexpectedly pleasant place for a lazy sunday brunch. Along a stretch of Robertson Quay that's better known for coming to life at night.My fiance and I have a standard brunch habit - we almost always order salmon poached eggs and pancakes. They didn't have salmon and poached eggs in their menu but I requested that the eggs benedict be replaced with a salmon and they accommodated it just fine, no need to pay extra, etc. Just for kicks, we also ordered the huevos rancheros - that's what mexicans have for brunch and its made of scrambled eggs, refried beans, salsa, avocado and crispy tortillas. The avocados needed abit of salt but otherwise I really enjoyed this dish! Just dump everything on the crispy tortilla and enjoy the mini mexican party in your mouth. The poached eggs and salmon were scrumptious and satisfying. The pancakes were generous but we've had better. Overall, we left as happy campers and all set for the rest of the lazy sunday...Final verdict: Just like a boomerang, I'll definitely be back.",

I had the calamari and the mezze platter which was good enough but nothing fantastic. A bit overpriced actually I thought, for the quality of the food. The crowd is mainly expats, lots of Aussies and people who live around the area. Its a nice enough ambience, overlooking the river.",

    "text": "Planned to go to Boomerang (grrr, Boomarang??)on a Friday evening. Made online reservationists just in case. Heard nothing, so made a follow up phone call and confirmed our reservations. We do not live anywhere near Robertson Quay so getting here was quite a trek. Hindsight, believe or not, should have driven.Finally get to Robertson Quay and we are dodging gobs of free range dogs and kids roaming about the area. Gobs! Clearly this is a very family friendly part of town. Show up to the restaurant on time. There is no record of our reservation. Kind of bugs me, but only kind of. The place is about half full so no big deal. We are seated. There is indoor outdoor seating, a nice sized well stocked bar area and tons of TVs playing a variety of sports. Another plus is the restaurant sits alongside the waterway and you can watch the tourist boats gliding by. Aside from the reservation snafu, service was really top notch. We ordered our food and it was out within ten minutes. The waitress was really great. She was very attentive.Our starters were the kangaroo sliders. And a side order of garlic bread. Sliders were very good. We ordered rare and they were rare. After the sliders, the rest of our dinner was okay to not good.. I ordered the fish and chips. It included a little salad. The dish was good. The fish was nicely \u00a0fried. But the plate that was used was too small so fries were constantly falling onto the table. My companion ordered the lamb. He got a much larger plate, weird, since his portion was smaller. Lamb was very tough and flavorless. We decided to pass on dessert.All in all our experience was okay. I now realize It might have been a better experience for my partner and I if we approached Boomerang as a pub and not a restaurant. So on our next visit (via cab) maybe do a Tuesday trivia, stick with the bar menu, and let loose! Hopefully darting children will be safely tucked into bed as I stumble home.",

The food is good, the service is friendly, and they have happy hour. The food is a little pricey, but pretty standard for the area. But the food is very good. The Wagyu burger is pretty great, and comes with beets in it. You can add a fried egg and bacon for a bit extra. I was happy to find that the fries that came with the burger were good also. For lunch, they have a lunch special for $12. It involves a sandwich and soup which is really good. The sandwich menu changes weekly depending on what's in season and what the chef feels like making, so there's always something new to try. \u00a0Happy hour is weekdays 5pm - 8pm and weekends 2pm - 8pm. They also have some weekly events. Tuesday is trivia night. Wednesdays is beer and burger night where their great wagyu burgers + a beer is $25 and also pint night ($10 for a pint).",

    "text": "Boomerang featured prominently in a list of top kid-friendly brunch spots in Singapore...Perhaps after being featured among such august company, the restaurant decided not to bother anymore, because the effort was seriously lacking at brunch one sunny, Singaporean Sunday...The harassed wait staff managed to weave around shimmying, speedy scamps while completely ignoring our requests for condiments and unapologetically refusing to replace an incorrectly entered entree. \u00a0(Frankly, I'm not sure how you justify this when you have two open face melts with the same name)...Our vegetarian friend was left staring aghast at an open face turkey melt...The only saving graces were the wonderful company and the lovely, riverfront setting...and at least my eggs were served over medium as ordered...PARTING THOUGHT: For an Australian restaurant, there weren't many Aussie options on the menu...",

Perfect spot for watching sports with some friends. Right on the river so nice ambience. I go here all the time and quality is consistent. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is it is very very expensive. 10 bucks for a mug of coffee is nuts even for Singapore. But it is superb coffee..",

The meat is a little bit dry dispite medium doneness, but with the served topping it is really delicous. So you can sit here in nice atmosphere, watching some rugby other other sports stuff on the flatscreens and simply have a good time.",
