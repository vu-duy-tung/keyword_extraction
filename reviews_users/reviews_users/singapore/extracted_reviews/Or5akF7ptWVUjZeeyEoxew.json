    "text": "Food (1): For a Michelin star restaurant, I was severely disappointed in the food. To be fair, this could be my fault. I ordered the 3 BBQ Combo item. This included BBQ pork, Roasted Pork Belly and BBQ Ribs. Maybe I don't quite understand what Michelin means, especially for a \"hawker\". It's only after I sat down and looked at the screen and realize that they are known for their Soy Sauce Chicken. I thought Michelin stars for for the restaurant as a whole, not just one dish, but I could be wrong. Maybe the Soy Sauce Chicken is worth a try. However, I can say for an absolute fact that the 3 BBQ Combo I got was just pure trash. BBQ pork was not marbled in anyway and was completely dried and lacking in sauce. Roasted Pork Belly had barely any fat between the skin and meat. On top of that the Skin was dry and damp instead of having that oily, crisp crunch. Ribs were dry as well and also lacking sauce. As someone from the SGV area of SoCal, even he most average Chinese restaurant tops this place.Service (5): The line to order wasn't too bad and moved quickly. For some odd reason people were lining up to order with the cashier. But there was a order machine right next to them. I skipped the lines and made a quick easy order using that. I really enjoyed that and am a sucker for innovation so I am giving it a 5 because of that.Ambiance (3): You will notice I put hawker in quotes on the food section. This is because it's not really a hawker. It's a restaurant. Maybe at one point it was a hawker stall at the hawker centers, but not anymore. It's just a regular restaurant. Nothing special about it. It's pretty bland, but at least it's clean.Price (4): Decent and cheap price. However, this is an American's point of view and food is generally cheaper for us because of the conversion rates.",

    "text": "As of March 2017, the one michelin star is awarded only for the original stall (Liao Fan). I understand the Hawker Chan outlets will be vying for a michelin star award later this year. Until then ... for me the real winner is the soya sauce chicken and even the sauce too. All other dishes/sides are alright but nothing special about them. You can find equivalent quality for these other dishes/sides elsewhere.I have tried here twice and enjoy having the noodles with soya sauce chicken. The rice seems quite popular here and so is the Hor Fun except that Hor Fun noodles do not arrive early. My colleague ordered it at 12nn but was told the noodles were not in yet.Waiting in this restaurant is quite comfortable.First you queue up to place an order. As you get nearer the counter, you will eventually have a choice of ordering via a vending machine or continue in the line to the counter staff. People tend to take quite some time at the vending machine so I take that to mean it's not user friendly enough. This ordering queue takes about 15-20 mins, based on the before 12nn crowds.After placing your order and paying up, you will be given a receipt with a queue number. Now you can go to your seat and look out for the TV monitors that show the queue number for food collection.So far, diners there will just eat and go and not much lingering around so you should be able to get a table fairly quickly.I will go back again - just for the chicken.",

Although there's plenty of seats, it took some time to find a seat for 2 because it was so crowded.My boyfriend and I each ordered their famous soya chicken and rice dish. I ordered the roasted pork with noodles and the bf ordered the chair siu with noodles. My take on each dish:-Soya chicken and rice: The chicken was tender, but a little dry. I ended getting a portion with a ton of bones, whereas my bf said his was boneless. The rice was cold and hard - blegh! Was disappointed with this dish.-Roast pork with noodle: I enjoyed this dish more than the soya chicken dish. The noodles were tasty and the pork skin had a nice crunch to it. The bf said he liked the char siu dish with noodles. Worth a try, but I didn't understand the hype. Maybe it's just this location? Other reviews said the original stand is better.",

The chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful that paired well with plain white rice. I came on a Sunday morning around 11:30am, no line and easily found seating. I recommend using their electronic kiosk to order because that seems to be faster than ordering with the cashier. The kiosk accepts cash and credit cards, prints a receipt at the end to get your meal. I also ordered the bean sprouts, which I thought were too salty. The portions are plentiful for 2 people. Staff seems to work quickly to clear and clean tables. Overall, my experience was good, but I wasn't totally blown away.",

But let me remind you, this is in a Hawker Center - open air dining in hot and humid conditions. Since it's in a Hawker Center, there are several stalls that offer a variety of food and you just have to walk around patiently to find Hawker Chan. A good indication that you've found it is: the longest line in the entire Hawker Center!You place your order, find a table, and enjoy your meal - or take yours to-go. There's a charge for to-go containers.If you want the full experience and you're not the whiny type, come here. Otherwise, go to the air conditioned version across the street and pay extra for the slight convenience.I've tried their soya chicken, char siew, roasted pork, rice, and noodles. My favorite was the roasted pork - it's everything that's good with Chinese roasted pork. De-li-cious! The noodles tend to get cold quick so you might want to take a quick pic of your food for Instagram and eat right away.",

The key to this place is to get here early, as I showed up 45 min before it even opened and there was already 15 people in line. The food is good and well worth the visit, I ordered the chicken and rice plate as that was their most notable dish. The prices are reasonable so I would suggest stocking up on two plates and sampling something else on the menu.

I had the chicken and rice plate. The food is very simple, with straight-laced Chinese flavors. I don't know what Michelin starred food is supposed to be like, but while my meal was certainly appetizing and satisfying, it was nothing life-changing. However, the combo of well marinated meat + carbs + veggies + ice cold beer + AC amidst the heat and humidity outside should not be underestimated.",

    "text": "I came here twice at the end of August during my visit to Singapore. This review is strictly about the food. I love soy sauce chicken. I don't like white meat and always prefer the dark. That being said, this is the best soysauce chicken I've ever had in my lifetime thus far. Ever since I left singapore I've been craving it so much. It left such a strong impression on me that I now refuse to order soysauce chicken back home because I know I'll be disappointed. The chicken is so so so so tender!!! I ate the white meat, yes the white meat and it was juicy and moist!!! The one place I don't mind eating white meat chicken instead of dark! That says a lot for me. Also the soya is sweet and savory. They pour the same sauce over with your rice or noodle. I do wish they gave a little more chicken though. After my first visit, I had to go back and get half a chicken. I also got a side order of the roasted pork and the Cha siu. Each time I've ordered these, they were always very flavorful and juicy. The pork was super crispy and the burnt ends of the cha siu were delicious.Now I'm salivating and hungry and craving all this as I finish my review. P.S I also enjoyed the pickled chili peppers from the condiments section. I'd come back to Singapore just for the chicken.",

    "text": "By the last day of my trip, I had eaten all of the above, visited other hawker stalls, and even enjoyed a 10-course meal at Jaan, named one of Asia's 50 Best Restaurants in 2017. With the bar set this high, I finally arrived at Hawker Chan's. When I stepped into the small restaurant, I was surprised to see Chef Chan behind the glass, brows furrowed and in deep concentration as he rapidly prepared rice and noodle plates for the lunch crowd. To my surprise, he looked up to wave when it was my turn to order at the counter. I would soon learn that this display of warmth, which was unexpected given his level of fame these past years, was also somehow transferred to his food creations. Some say the difference between a good dish and an exemplary dish is that the latter is cooked with love. As I placed the first spoonful of rice and chicken into my mouth, I understood this sentiment. Every bite of chicken was tender, and every morsel of rice fragrant. Chef Chan turned this very ordinary dish into something amazing. I looked around and watched as other customers -- customers from Hong Kong, Indonesia, Canada and Beijing -- savored every bite. lowdownonchinatown.com/h\u2026",

    "text": "I rated this place 3-star in TripAdvisor for this reason: \"Had the description of 2-star rating isn't 'Poor' but 'Below Average', I would have rated it as 2 stars.\"Originally, I wanted to visit the 1 Michelin star rated Liao Fan HK Chicken Rice stall located at the Chinatown Food Complex opposite this shop. However unexpectedly, it was closed (on a Tuesday). So I'm left with no choice but to try this \"branch\" with a lower rating of mere Bib Gourmand. The experience was nothing short of a MAJOR disappointment. My original intention was to simply write: - Save as to the truly tenderness of chicken, nothing is special. - The chicken is flavour-less. - The soy sauce put on top of the rice does not make it taste different, just normal soy sauce. - Chilli sauce provided is a little weird in taste. - Add-on Roasted Pork is dry, although the skin is indeed crispy. - Food servers at the food collection counter has a TERRIBLE attitude problem, they cannot be bothered to wait for a mere 10-15 seconds of walking time from table seated to the counter but will simply spam and abuses the bell. Extremely rude in manners, simply \"swing\" the tray to your direction, instead of placing it still for your collection. I will not revisit this shop. However, I might still try Hawker Chan's chicken rice at the original shop in the food complex. Let's hope by the real man doing the dishes himself, all these Quality Control defects can be eliminated and I get to enjoy a truly amazing plate of chicken rice. Note:- Always try to visit the stall at second floor Chinatown Food Complex and only take this shop as a backup plan. - The stall opens at 10.00 a.m., multiple reviews suggests that you can avoid the queue by being there at 9.45 a.m. The same reviews suggest that their chicken might be sold out as early as 1 p.m. - According to Michelin's website, they are closed on Wednesdays.- If you're coming straight from Changi Airport, apparently the faster way of getting to this shop was to disembark at Outram Park MRT Station (East West Line) rather than Chinatown MRT Station. Visited 10 October 2017. Food ordered: Soya Sauce Chicken Rice (SGD 3.80), add-on Roasted Pork (SGD 3.00) - Major disappointment. Ordinary chicken rice.",
