    "text": "If I could post 6 stars then I would since IKYU is a 6-stars experience. I am so glad that I didn't get reservation at the first 7 omakase restaurants that I called and managed to get 1 at IKYU on Saturday night. In the meantime, I wish that IKYU would get the attention and love that they long deserve since they might be the best while not the most expensive omakase restaurant in Singapore. The location is very chiq and romantic at Tiong Baru neighborhood. The d\u00e9cor and atmosphere is amazing (you can feel that they even they got the room temperature right!) So perfect in their fine dining experience service. The service is attentive and exceptional. The food is one of the rarest of the freshest and the most delicious of dishes. I paid for 360$ total for 2 sets of omakase and it worths all the money down to the pennies. People who loves Japanese food and a fan of omakase really needs to come down here and you won't be disappointed.",

Called them up to ask for a table for two in 5 minutes and it wasn't a problem (this is a weekday lunch). Nice decor, in hipster Tiong Bahru... but warning bells sounded. The menu was awfully confusing, with unsophisticated font and layout. I decided on the 7 piece sushi set lunch which includes appetizer, sushi as main, and dessert. $48 isn't *nothing, so I am expecting something fairly decent. Appetizer was salad with some seaweed and mayonnaise based dressing. Ok. Just ok. The sushi platter was ... meh. I don't know if it's because I'm ageing, and having dined at very good sushi restaurants, I am very demanding? The shari (rice) of the sushi was crappy, the wasabi is 100% fake -- but ok, maybe Ikyu doesn't even purport to be giving the real stuff as it is fusion? Is it? The nigiri were not brick like, but made small to fit into the mouth in a bite, so that was authentic... but the ginger slices tasted pre made.. etc etc. Dessert was a scoop of matcha ice cream and we were asked if we wanted to top up $2.50 (or $3?) for cheesecake. We declined. The restaurant seemed to have seen much better days. It was half full... and I did watch the main chef prepare an aburi sushi platter with pricier fish on it. But it didn't look that good. I should have just stuck to sushi bar, for $10 less /person for much better fish, more filling food. And no pretense. I'm just relieved i didn't opt for the $88 tasting meal or the omakase. Also, clearly won't return. This was also a good lesson for myself to either go for inexpensive supermarket sushi, more affordable options like sushi bar, or all out splurge at $100 plus /person at the likes of Hashida.",

Omakase lacked variety for $380 for 2 pax.The best dish was the starter, scallops with truffle and kombu. Fish was fresh and there was a lot of sushi and sashimi. There was one dish of pork that was very chewy, couldn't bite through. The chef mentioned they are undergoing some change in the kitchen so perhaps it may improve. Skip the omakase. I think Bincho round the corner in Tiong Bahru serves way better food for this kind of price. \u00a0Better to get a-la-carte sashimi type of food here.",

    "text": "We wanted to go to a more upscale place for our sunday brunch but after reading mixed reviews of the food, we decided to scrap the plan and try some other place instead. My friend, S, then suggested IKYU and we all agreed to try this place. I've walked pass this restaurant many times since I frequent Books Actually (book store) but haven't got a chance to try. \u00a0Since we're meeting up to celebrate my \"home coming\", what better place to re-start my restaurant hop in this tiny island filled with good food at IKYU. The three of us opted for their value for money set lunch. Priced from $28 onwards, i think it's a steal considering IKYU is a semi-fine dining (?) establishment in the hip Tiong Bahru neighbourhood. We ordered Yuzu tea to start (refreshing, $4 a glass) and a bowl of grilled truffle edamame. SImple and delicious.We also ordered 2 other appetizers of golden Anago (eel) sushi roll and as well as grilled mentaiko. The grilled mentaiko is a tad too salty just make sure you eat it together with the sliced cucumber that comes with it. The set lunch comes with a starter of apple salad and vegetable tempura. Both are tasting portions. As for mains, I ordered Bara Chirashi (rice topped with fresh raw salmon, white fish, tuna cut in cubes) while my 2 friends ordered grilled kampachi served with white rice. The grilled kampachi was fresh and lightly seasoned with salt. All set lunch comes with miso soup as well. Just like any set lunch, you get dessert and coffee/ tea to end the meal. We thought the dessert was the weakest and couldnt even figured out what was served - a citrusy pudding done bad topped with fresh cream and a tiny slice of strawberry and melon globe. In total, we paid $150-ish for 3 drinks, 2 starters and 3 set lunches. Service was ok and restaurant tend to get a bit noisy.",

    "text": "This is my second time here - I came in April 2014, and again, last night.We called a couple hours before dinner for a reservation, and the restaurant told us the earliest they could fit us in was 8pm. We got into the area at 7pm and walked past IKYU, and half of it was empty. Never mind, we spent a good half hour browsing books next door at the very hipster Books Actually. We came out of Books Actually poorer, but enriched, and hunger gnawed at my very mortal body, and we walked in at 730 pm and were seated promptly. I am very puzzled but whatever. We ordered the century egg potato salad and the truffle scallop carpaccio to start, and left our dinner in the hands of the dashing chef - omakase please!The century egg potato salad was very meh. I could see bits of century egg but I couldn't quite taste it. I would like to dedicate a paragraph especially to the scallop carpaccio. I noticed that they had reformulated the dish, and revised the price upwards of 5 dollars, which is reasonable as I explain the reformulation. Previously, their scallop carpaccio had truffle oil and truffle paste, and they have now revised it. Their scallop carpaccio now has real shaved Italian black truffle and seaweed flakes for more umami. Yum! I do wish they had some truffle oil to bring all the flavors and umami together, but this is a stunning redo of my favorite dish there!Omakase started itself.1. Egg tofu, simmered tuna, crunchy roe. Quite delicious to eat simple things, simple and earthy. 2. SashimiFresh, good.3. Fried oysters, eggplant, in a radish puree soup. Tastes exactly as it sounds. The soup was radish puree suspended in a tasty dashi. 4. Grilled WagyuVery tender, melt-in-your-mouth, served simply with garlic chips and spring onion.5. Asparagus with prawn in the batter, on a bed of hot bean sauce.I didn't like this at all. The hot bean sauce overwhelmed the delicate prawn and asparagus flavors. 6. SushiSeasoned well, with wasabe just right.7. Ebi soupVery simple, yet complex, with amazing body. Yes it is a soup, and not the woman of your dreams.8. Melon ice cream, \u00a0tofu cheesecake, fruit.Melon ice cream is something the Japanese do very well. The flavor pops and that's when you raise your eyebrows in surprise. The tofu cheesecake was very blah. I enjoyed my meal, but had I written a review back in April, I would have given their omakase 5 stars, not 4. I think creativity has dipped slightly. Still good, I would come back again. This place is pricey; two omakase sets, and two starters, and 4 alcoholic drinks later, the bill was about $450.",

I started typing this review in 2013, which I guess meant I missed out on an FTR, but oh well.I've never been here for dinner, but lunch is decent value. The chirashi bowl has so much raw fish and it's all of excellent quality that it's pretty reminiscent of Teppei. There're a variety of other sets for those not raw-fish inclined, and overall the fact that colleagues and I come here once every while for lunch means that it's not bad nor painfully overpriced. Prices *have* gone up a bit since they opened but I think the value proposition is still A-OK. It's hard for places like this to be exceptional in a day and age where Japanese restaurants are so common and so many offer similar prices with similar qualities. Once upon a time a find like this would have been four stars, but I think the Japanese cuisine bubble has burst, and nowadays? This is a three star joint. Solidly so, but I'm not sure about it being four stars. It's close though.",

    "text": "For reviews and more, visit my blog.I suppose by now everyone has heard of IKYU (Tiong Bahru) by now. It's a high end Japanese dining joint opened by Executive Chef Takuma Seki, former chef-de Cuisine of Hide Yamamoto at Marina Bay Sands. And it is the only Japanese restaurant in the hippie coffee zone in Singapore- Yong Siak Street. The interior is a futuristic industrial jungle made with stunning pieces of brass, bronze and concrete. Definitely an atypical Japanese restaurant and i'm not quite sure how it relates to fine dining or the Zen that IKYU tries to achieve. It's not that i don't like the decor, it's just that i feel it works better for an izakaya bar instead.Food wise, the prices are on the high side as IKYU takes pride in using quality ingredients. The fish is flown in three times a week from Tsukiji and so, sashimi prices start from $15.50 for 5pcs of Salmon/Squid/Engawa to $68.50 for 5pcs of Blue Fin Otoro tuna. Sadly, the fish didn't come close to the Tsukiji sort that i've had. The lunch menu on the other hand is a lot more affordable ($25/35) and i'm glad i tried this before even considering their ala carte menu. 4 sets are available and each comes with appetizer, salad, soup and dessert. Pardon the bad quality pictures as it was a spontaneous lunch and the lighting is not the most ideal for food photography.The IKYU sushi set ($35), assorted sushi 6 pieces and roll, is the most pricy of the lot because of the expensive fish from Tsukiji. If you have eaten at Tsukiji before, these sushi are like half the size of what you get there. I was perhaps 50% filled after eating this and i don't consider myself to be the biggest eater around (just look at my size). I found the fish to be on the dry side as well.S had the IKYU Chirashi set ($25) which is the same Bara chirashi on the menu ($28 ala carte). Little cubes of sashimi?! You've got to be kidding me. The only other place that i see cubed sashimi is at Sushi Tei and they serve it on their salads. Honestly there are way better chirashi-dons around and i would direct you to my favorites- Chikuwatei and Tomo Izakaya. They give you fresh, chunky, sliced sashimi. Not diced ones.Perhaps the seven-course omakase menu ($128) would provide you with a better idea of the quality of the food served at IKYU, but honestly, i would rather take the money somewhere that can actually fill me up. IKYU is just average to me. I think i would be happier eating at Sushi Tei in fact. Maybe i'm biased; a hungry girl is an angry one. It makes me hungry just thinking about this one. :/Would IKYU work for the Tiong Bahru crowd? I can't speak for the others but IKYU is not convincing enough to draw me away from the River Valley/Clarke Quay area for Japanese",

Their set lunches range from $28-35 and are pretty affordable, considering you get an appetizer, main, soup, coffee or tea (usually served at the end, but you can request to have it during your meal) and dessert (which to be honest, can be hit or miss.) The chirashi is very popular with our group, but I actually prefer their sushi!I don't normally order off their a la carte menu, but I do recommend the grilled seasonal vegetables. I believe they put truffle salt on it and it's super delish! I love their decor and their attention to detail. Their hot towels always smell of lemongrass, which is such a nice touch. Their servers are also very attentive and clear plates efficiently. There is also a strong focus on presentation, so the food is always Instagram-worthy!Though it can seem a bit pricy for some, I think this is the perfect place to go if Open Door Policy is looking a bit steep, but you're not in the mood for a cafe setting, either.",

The second and main course was the miso-marinated black cod, served with a grilled rice ball and a selection of grilled vegetables. The texture of the fish was perfect; it melted in your mouth. The rice ball was crisp and chewy all at once, and the grilled veggies had flavour and texture -- even the lotus was yummy! The third course was a shrimp tempura somen -- utterly slurpable and delicate. Lastly, dessert. I had the mille-feuille while my partner had the cheesecake. We both oohed and ahhed as we took tiny bites so as to make the experience last longer!!Presentation of all the dishes was stunning -- the attention to detail was not lost on me, from the garnishes to the balanced colours on the plate, to the types of dinnerware used. The service was attentive and friendly, and perfectly timed. Our servers responded to our every need and never felt in the way. They re-filled our water glasses without hesitation and were smiling at each interaction. My only complaint is that we had to ask for water -- IMO this should be the first thing served upon giving the patron a menu. However, the service was impeccable in every other manner, so it is difficult to be too upset about this!The atmosphere is friendly, warm, and upwardly casual. The ambiance is elegant but not pretentious. Dark hues on the walls mix neatly with well-lit spaces and tables that feel private even though they are next to each other. One last small complaint -- their website includes a photo with several pretty-looking cocktails. They look delectable! Yet their beverages menu includes only two cocktails on the list. I'd love to see IKYU design a few more to match their marketing campaign and the unique flavours of their food menu... I can't wait to go back and try their a la carte menu!",

The restaurant is in a cool neighborhood that has so much history. We always prefer sitting at the sushi bar and the chef will just do what's freshest. Excellent restaurant and we were lucky to have found it!",

    "text": "I came here for lunch as I was craving japanese food and this was the only one around my work place. Lunch sets range from 20s to 30s and I have to say, I really liked the experience. Every lunch set comes with an appetizer, soup, ice cream and coffee or tea. I had the bara chirashi set and ordered a side of engawa and hotate sushi on the side. The bara chirashi was really good, a little low on the rice but the fish was super fresh, plentiful and served with fresh wasabi and shiso pieces, which really enhanced the flavor of the rice. The chef was nice enough to serve my two hotate sushi one aburi, one raw with seasoning, and both were delish. The aburi piece had a bit of sea salt burnt on top and it really brought out the sweetness of the fresh hotate. The engawa was served with yuzu and excellent as well. The appetizer of the day was apple salad with takoyaki, and the takoyaki was freshly made with crisp slin and melting glorious content. Apple salad was good too. And the soup was a clam mushroom miso soup with egg and it was earthy with a great combination of sweet and savory. Loved it. Will definitely be back for more.",
