It was a fun night catching up with friends and gossiping.Timbre has a nice outdoor ambience where you can let your hair down and enjoy the band, beer and food.Love the pizza they serve and the variety which you an mix and match. The duck pizza is simply too delicious and i simply fall in love with it.It is located near the town area and is hiding in a secluded area with a mini carpark. There is a big carpark located beside it so do not worry about the carpark space.Two thumps up for the relaxing ambience and a awesome band.I will definitely visit this place again.",

Spent many special occasions and moments here, and with the dopest local band, Goodfellas!Goodfellas played for the longest here at Timbre Substation, and they engaged with the audiences perfectly! (No time for awkwardness man!) Customers can always dedicate songs via SMS, convenient, and you will be sure they read it out. (Seriously there are many other places still using paper and pen for dedication, hello?)Food here is awesome!Signature duck pizza, thin crust, topped with crispy crackers and special sauce!Seafood pizza, good for sharing too!Menu are also updated with new selection of pizza. Now we have green curry pizza and Goodfellas pizza! Dope!Greedy and spoilt for choice can always top up a few bucks for a half and half (choose 2 types of pizzas!)Drinks are normal I would say, your basic beers, cocktails, house pours, spirits, wines.It's my personal favourite chill out place - good food, awesome resident band, alcohol!",

However, over the years and the numerous times I have visited it, I have never been able to convince myself that this is my home pub.I thrive on atmosphere where everyone joins in with the band and sings. At the same time, it does not get too warm. However, this joint is kinda like a miss-hit on that front. However, food and service is what it can be proud of. Pizza, fries, wedges are all superb and there is more than enough staff to wait on patrons so that you do not need to poke your head up ever so often.Depending on what matters to you but Timbre is a once-in-a-while place for me but would never replace my home pub.",

It's a winning formula: beer, pizza, snacky food and good live music. Pity I don't come too often because of the queue and the fact that it's so frequently standing room only. If it wasn't so warm, I might, but it's part of the attraction I guess!",

    "text": "Good wings and live music nightly. But be ready to talk over the booming tunes.Pizzas are average, some fusion combos that don't really work for me (Peking duck pizza??). Most of the food are forgettable. Don't bother with cocktails here, you can never go wrong with beer though. Service is a little slow and hard to get a hold of. There's always a line on weekends (including Fridays) so buffer at least 20-30 mins waiting in line if you don't have a reservation, or on nights when they don't take reservations.",

    "text": "Good food and good music - don't think you can ask for much more!It's always fully packed on the weekends and even some weekdays so do make a reservation in advance - they don't hold tables for very long either so you've got to get there on time. They don't however take reservations on friday nights, and their Arts House Outlet doesn't take reservations for saturday nights either. Can be abit of a hassle going down only to find it packed, but there are lots of alternative venues that you can walk to at Boat Quay from the Arts House Outlet. Don't like how they don't take reservations, makes it hard to plan for a gathering - its probably the biggest pull back for me.Different bands play every night - so do check out the Timbre website to check out when your favourite band is playing, and what time they start. \u00a0It can get a little warm as the venues aren't airconditioned, and I've had an attack by mosquitoes at the Substation outlet - perhaps its the location up on the hill? But I'll surely be bringing some mosquito repellent with me the next time I go there!",

    "text": "This place is lovely to unwind after the hustle bustle of school (for those who are studying at SMU) or for those who would like some good acoustic music to chill to. Their specialty wings are to die for with the crisp exterior, sweet and sour sauce and tender succulent meat. Also worth trying is their duck pizza! I really crave this on some days as it has the right amount of sweet sauce, duck, crispy crackers (not really sure what they call it - but it sure is tasty and crackle sin your mouth) and all served on a thinly crusted pizza. All this downed with a pint of good beer, is simply delightful.",

The atmosphere here is just fantastic, with trees popping out in the middle of the venue, a big stage for performers, and great ambient lighting.You can get some decent pizza here, including the mouth-watering duck flavour. I also like the spicy seafood pizza. Also try the chicken wings.The best part is of course chatting with friends over beer.But once the bands start to play, the music gets really loud so chatting is out of the question. Stick around and listen to the local bands; some of them are really good!But if you come after 6.30pm, be prepared to queue.",

Though the prawns are very good and I ordered the wrong thing anyway--what you want are the pizzas and the chicken wings. There's a goodly selection of drinks (cocktails, bottled beers etc) and the live music comes on later in the evening so get your talking done before the bands start.",
