    "text": "First time having brazillian bbq and the experience was just MEH! Could be a good thing in that my expectation was non-existent to begin with. but could also be a bad thing because i was not amused with Carnivore's attempt to match the awesomeness that is Pampas in California. the dining experience was kind of weird. for a supposed fancy dining, the dining tables are placed right in the middle of the mall. there was no warm ambiance, only the bright lights from the mall. & the servers come out to you with sticks full of meat where they carve it out to you on the table. i think i would have preferred a better dining decor to match a high $$$ dining experience. salad bar was just alright. i'd rather fill myself up with the meat that would have costed a lot more! all the meat were rather kind of cooked well done. so they were dry and really hard to chew. my teeth got tired after the second round when i just gave up on getting any more meat. the only good one i would say was the bacon wrapped beef which would have been the only juicy one. service is meh. they seemed annoyed when some of us rejected their meat. tip* you can switch to the red color if your table has a lot of meat on their plate and want to stop them from coming to your table. it's kind of like a \"do not disturb, i'm busy devouring my meat\" card. probably wouldn't come back. too pricey for mediocre cooking of meat.",

    "text": "Salad bar was good. The food was cooked well done, I asked for medium rare and was given a hard time, the meat was poorly seasoned, not true Brazilian style. They advertised 15% off your bill as an early bird guest so , we decided to eat at carnivore, we even asked if that was true and the hostess said yes. Then the bill was delivered with the manager and he said, that's only valid everyday of the week except for today. We didn't bake it a big deal we paid the bill. But the the ham comes around 5 times and the beef made a single appearance. When asked if the beef can make one more round and we were told to ask the manager for that request.We sat down to eat at 6pm and we were gone by 7:15pm, because we sat there for 20min with empty plates.",

    "text": "It's no Pampas in Palo Alto. What a nice concept but poorly executed. I did not imagine the dining area would be in the middle of the mall but I had it on my bookmarks so I was determined to try it. We waited for quite some time before anyone gave us plates and asked us what we'd like to drink. The salad bar was good. I went up a few times. There was this lamb thing, like stew that was delicious. The lamb was super tender. The tuna salad was also good. That was all I came up for.... walk through mall traffic to get to the salad bar from the dining area.The first round of bacon wrapped chicken was super dry. The second round was a lot better; the chicken was juicy but not flavorful. Really under-seasoned. The ham was salty. Most of the cuts of beef I tried were tough and over-cooked. Unlike Pampas (even the place I despise: Fogo de Chao), they would ask my preference: rare, medium, well done). This place did not ask... Service was friendly but I would not return.",

    "text": "WARNING!! People who are concern about their weight and Vegan and PETA, stay far away from this restaurant as possible!!Meat lover and carnivore!! this is the closes thing to heaven on earth as you can get!! at least until its time to pay the bill that is. This is a Brazilian style buffet restaurant locate in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sand shopping mall, near one if its entrance. So there is not much privacy since people walk by in and out of the mall all the time. Price is quite high, their salad bar is pathetic, got a wide selection of drinks and cocktail though. Their claim to fame are their varieties of Brazilian style grill meat....ahmmmmm \u00a0meatttttt. Those juicy perfectly grill steak roll in beacon, pork belly, ribs and so many more parade to your table for you to choose.... worth the price for me.",

    "text": "Don't think I'll return again. Service was terrible. For some reason the servers with the meat have preferences of a certain seating area, and if you are not one of them, good luck. We stayed here for two hours and only had the servers come by 3, 4 times. We even requested to the server to come by but didn't help. This has turned out to be a very disappointing dining experience. If you really feel like Brazilian BBQ, I recommend Going to the one in Chijmes.",

    "text": "At the far end of vast Marina Bay Sands you'll find a restaurant that truly lives up to its name. After you settle in with some self-serve salad (which is good, by the way) the waiter will come from the kitchen with a rack of meat on a long skewer. Just point at the meat you want and you get it. After each course of meat, repeat. And repeat. Seriously. Even when we flipped the meat request sign to n\u00e3o (No in Portuguese) they STILL kept bringing us meat. I don't know when was the last time I ate that much of anything. They'll bring you most every kind of meat you can think of off the top of your head. However, quantity usually means a sacrifice in quality, and of course you can expect that the meat is decently juicy but not top-notch. Overall this a unique experience, a novelty restaurant that's not out of place in the massive tourist resort that is MBS, but don't expect anything brilliant.",

    "text": "Carnivore inside the MBS opened several weeks ago. I went here versus its other locations because I expected a top notch venue in the MBS and a great churrascaria experience, something one normally would not expect in Singapore. The actual experience could not have been more disappointing.Service= non-existent. We asked to be moved because for 10 minutes after seating, we were ignored completely. Then, after more minutes, we had to wave someone down to ask to order since no one was attending to us even after we asked to be moved because \"we felt we were being ignored\". We said this to the waitress but she did not act on this after she moved us. We ordered our caipirinhas and then waited again patiently for someone to come take our food order. Finally , someone did. The way the servers serve the various meat on the skewers was unusual. They stuck the entire skewer directly onto our plates instead of on their mini plates. There were no tongs for us to grab the meat slices, as would normally occur in a churrascaria. Instead, the entire skewer was placed on our plates and the large knife slicing the meat seemed to loom uncomfortably and dangerously just a few inches from my face. I had to move myself back in my chair to avoid being too close to the knives.We ordered the Pao de Queijo (Brazilian cheese bread) three times before it came. The first time we ordered it with a waitress who knew what it was and said it would be coming. After the food arrived with no bread, we asked the meat server who had no idea what that was. When I said it in English instead of Portuguese, \"cheese bread\", he still had no idea and left us to ask someone else. That other someone, another waitress, came by, and after repeating our order, she left not understanding what we wanted. Finally, the first waitress came with a basket of it and gave it to us. Sadly, the bread was overcooked, was hard at the bottom, and tasted nothing like Pao de Queijo should.The variety of the meats on offer was sparse- just 2-3 cuts of beef that were not flavorful, and a lot of non-beef meats, such as pork, chicken wrapped in bacon, etc. Overall, very disappointing quality of food.The decor of the place seemed sad and old, not modern and did not appear recently opened. \u00a0The spacing was tight and the buffet was in front of the diners at the entrance of the restaurant, blocking the view of the diners sitting inside from anything else but the buffet.The service continued to be non-existent throughout the meal.Our final bill with no wine was $160 for 2. As a churrascaria and as any normal restaurant, this is a big fail on all fronts. \u00a0The only exception was the caipirinha, which were reasonably priced and very good. We left very disappointed at the end of the evening.",

When the girls wanted some fruit, he mentioned he was concerned about any cross contamination with the tongs from the salad bar and brought some directly from the kitchen. The food was okay...there's only so much meat I can eat but I give it 4 stars because of the excellent service.",
