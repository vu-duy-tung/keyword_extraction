    "text": "It is all about Southern American Cajun seafood boil on our sunny island these days and we checked The Boiler, a gem tucked in the ulu and industrious Tai Seng estate. It's a queer location for a seafood spot but we absolutely dig the cavernous space and their delicious offerings. It made perfect sense for us to order the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag ($139) since there's a huge group of us (we had 3 bags of that). Each bag feeds more than the recommended 4 pax (that or we are small eaters). Dungeness or Brown Crab, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages, and corn are tossed with a sauce of your choice. For the sauce, there's garlic butter (for the kiddos), pepper butter (for amateurs), mild, medium and raging spice. Of the lot, i thought that the mild worked the best. It was more savory than the bland and boring garlic butter, but not too spicy to give you a heartburn or mar the taste of the seafood. Of the ingredients in the bag, I loved the succulent and juicy prawns, the salty chorizo style sausages, and not to mention the sweet corn! The juicy kernels provided a respite from the spices after a while. Get a lobster ($49) to go with your meal! Same price as Pince and Pints but without the queue (just make a reservation)! I liked this better than the crabs. Lemon butter was a good choice as the sauce is lighter and simpler, which allowed the freshness of the lobster to come through. The pepper butter can be rather overwhelming with spice in my opinion and not quite suitable for this meat.If you're not up for a seafood feasting, you could also do smaller meals such as fish and chips, chicken and waffles, and hot dogs as well. For desserts, we had the Molten Lava cake ($9.90) which remained fairly decent even after all the photo taking. The almond (mocha?) ice cream with Oreo crunch was a hit with us. Skip the fried banana and durian fritters ($7.90) with salted caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. It sounded way more exotic than it tasted and certainly not quite worth the price for fried pisang. Plus it had a stale oily taste.We really enjoyed our meal while it lasted. It was fun passing food around with our bare hands and letting loose at the dining table. However, the gastric reflux was pretty severe and the garlic aftertaste lingered long after the meal concluded. In fact, it's pretty nauseating thinking about it right now. So yes, it's a once in a blue moon indulgence for us. That said, I'd certainly recommend The Boiler for a gathering with family and friends! What's your favorite seafood boil?",

    "text": "We kicked off the lobster relvery with the Live whole Boston lobsters that are available in three different sauces. The Works (spiciness ranging from mild to raging hot), Garlic Butter and Peppa Butter. The Works is piquant with an assam-like tang, but not too spicy. With lobsters shipped in daily from US, the taste can hardly go wrong. Sweet and not overcooked, the chunky fleshes might be a hassle to remove from the shells at first but all efforts were rewarded when you mopped down with the sauces.But we soon found out that it's got more to offer than the lobster. Pick from brown crabs, prawns, mussels, clams and then choose your sauce. That said, the heartiest way to round off the evening is to feast on the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag ($139/4); literally a seafood bomb filled with everything including sausages, corns and some deep-fried mantou buns at the side for soaking up the juices. The starters were overall quite impressive too. The Louisiana Spicy Mid Joint Wings ($8.90) were zappy with a nice sour kick that makes you grab for more. The Southern Chicks and Waffles ($9.90) had plenty of crisp, not only in the chicken but more importantly in the waffles that were drizzled in maple syrup. I shy away from the Bacon Shrimp ($11.90) in smoky Hickory sauce because they were too salty. As for the Fish & Chips ($12.90), it's a classic in its own league. The fish stayed moist and piping hot within a light, crunchy batter. The Signature Lobsicle ($15.90), aka lobster on Popsicle, might be safer in the Boiler instead of the deep fryer as they were too chewy.Business was so good that the chocolate molten lava cake ran out of stock and so we settled for the C.B.D, a pungent pun on the business district of Singapore because it stood for Crispy Banana Durians. Forget about the Bananas were substituted by yams that night, cos the pungent durians have already stolen the limelight. As we all know, never judge a restaurant by the history or the location. Despite being opened only for a few months, it's no nonsense when it comes to the Cajun-style lobsters here. Walk in, sit down and put on the apron. We did. And we ate. We ate very well indeed.",

    "text": "Good, but lacking in a few bits of Louisiana culture.DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY. You have been warned!*Pros* The food is decent. The taste of the seafood in a bag is definitely cajun, and well marinated with the works. One whole bag (I can't remember which one I got) had enough crabs, prawns, mussels, cockles, corn and sausages enough for two to share. We also had the boston lobster (the price was on special!) marinated in garlic butter. The mid-joint wings was also pretty decent!*Cons* Missing mallets! Mallets would be helpful, especially for the lobsters! And perhaps extra wet-wipes and napkins? How about putting a kitchen roll at the table?And what happened to the root beer? Cajun-style seafood dinners demand either beer, or root beer if you are driving... And I was driving. The waitress told us that they used to carry root beer, but stopped due to low demand. She also told us a few things were no longer on the menu due to pricing costs, including the every popular lobster-sicle. Recommended: The Works Sauce, no matter what seafood you are getting! The bags are good value.The removal of some essential items that make it a truly Louisiana experience was pretty sad, as I have experienced \u00a0authentic US cajun before and unfortunately this was a derivative of the actual thing. But more importantly, which I hope the owners can probably read this, is that the marinade could possibly use a little stronger taste. The seafood is well marinated, but the cajun flavor I feel wasn't strong enough.Overall, knowing that the restaurant is new, I'll give them a thumbs up for their effort, and hope that they can improve the authenticity and overall feel of southern-style seafood!",

    "text": "I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by The Boiler.I haven't yet eaten at Cajun Kings, Crab in a Bag, or Dancing Crab, but it's clear that Louisiana-style seafood is the new big thing here.Made my reservations online via Chope the afternoon off even though it was for Sunday dinner. I didn't think it'd be that crowded but boy was I wrong. For a restaurant located in the middle of an industrial zone, on a Sunday night, this place was PACKED. When we got there every table was full, and the nearest roadside parking was two streets down. Surprising, to say the least.But hey, free parking on Sundays and after 5pm (I think) on weekdays means that despite its inaccessibility, it's quite worth driving in!We were a large group of 10 people, so we got to order a fairly broad range of items. We ordered two of their bags (feeds four each), one mildly spicy, one garlic butter. We ordered a lobster (medium spicy) because it was on offer, and plenty of sides. Seafood first.For $140+ per bag, it's good value. You get something like a whole crab, 6-8 pieces of prawns (maybe more, I wasn't counting), sausage, corn, mussels, clams, and some fried buns. The sauces are good too. The garlic butter was buttery rich and very garlicky. My only criticism is that by the time you're reaching the end of the bag, it's really heavy going. Conversely, the spicy sauces are less flavourful when you start out, but so much cleaner and lighter on the palate that you can keep going for longer. Mild spice is pretty disappointing for someone with the average Singaporean spice tolerance. I highly recommend medium. The corn in the bag was good, sweet and not overcooked. The crabs weren't the freshest I'd ever had, but they were still sweet and tasty.I wouldn't bother recommending the lobsicles, which are bite-sized bits of deep fried lobster, despite their fame. There's just nothing special about them. The Momma's Potato Scoops are basically just wedges served with cheese sauce, and the Spam Fries are spammier than most places. Not as crisp as they could have been either. The coleslaw was average, fresh tasting, but it felt very odd eating coleslaw by hand. I also feel the Jamaican alcoholic ginger beer is worth special mention. The alcohol taste is light, the ginger taste strong, and it's a great drink if you love ginger beer in general. (Though it's a bit sweet)The best part of the entire meal was really that, drinks included, everything came out to only $70 per person. Considering the amount we ate? Definitely worth it. Quite looking forward to heading back to try the maximum spice level!",

And yes , you need to use both your hands for a wholesome experience! The bib provided is clear plastic so it's not Selfie friendly but it gets the job done though. A wonderful place to hangout with friends and family. The beverage list is not bad , they have fruity refreshing beers and a wine selection too.
