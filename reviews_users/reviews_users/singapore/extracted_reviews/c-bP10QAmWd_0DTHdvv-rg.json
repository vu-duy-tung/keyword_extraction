    "text": "After grabbing a bite over at Tiong Bahru, we wandered around the neighborhood a bit and ended up at Plain Vanilla Bakery. It was a nice place to stop and hop out of the rain for a little bit. The front is open-air with artificial turf that kids can (and do) run around on a little bit; there's also an ice cream cart that you can get indulge yourself at (with the help of a barista from inside the shop). Inside, the ordering area is lined with lots of different bites, especially cupcakes. The enclosed seating area is to the left of the outside area; we didn't actually make our way in there as we wanted to enjoy the (mild) relief that the rain brought. We didn't have to wait too long for our drinks, and they were both solid - mine was a very refreshing agave lemonade that I housed in about a minutes' time; my wife went with a fruity iced tea that was still quite unsweetened and was a much more subtle flavor. We did grab a brownie to share as well; while the texture was a tad chalkier than I like, I did like the faint hint of fruit (think it was blackberry, or something similar) that was baked into it.While it's a tad out of the way, Plain Vanilla is on a street that has a few other hipster-y shops as well, and it's a solid place to grab a brew (or another beverage) and relax/work.",

The place is fairly small and the space a bit narrow but they do have some space outside, still covered by a roof so possible to use when raining as well. They actually also have a big swing there for people to play in. It is however also a lot of people who take the cupcakes and other pastries with them.The focus seems to be cupcakes in many forms and shapes. In general not one of my favorite pastries or baked goods but here they actually make some really good ones. They are not on the fantastic side of the scale but well worth to stop by if you are in the neighborhood but would not travel out here just for this.They also offer some beverages, would not recommend the coffee but the tea is decent as well as the cold beverages. The prices for the beverages are however a bit steep.",

It is also not very sweet, or gerlat tasting which was good since I had this right after dinner.The cinnamon cupcake frosting tasted very doughy and again very moist.The cupcakes are reasonably big and you definitely cut them up to share",

    "text": "Love the looks of this place :) and once you see their cakes and cupcakes, you would fall in love with this place. Open kitchen for you to look at how all the sweet delights are prepared. They are shelves of kitchen items and cookbooks for sale too. No wifi, as I see this as a trend now a days... Either their are being cheap about it or maybe they use to greater-good excuse that people are suppose to socialise more rather than having their head bend down and stuck to their phones. Either way, they have a very limited sitting area - one large square table to share, one Long side seat with cushions and a Long table Infront. Ok if you are just there to get a cuppa coffee and read your papers or just enjoy a cup cake or pastry, for bigger groups of people, maybe not. They use wooden forks and styrofoam plates (not a big fan of their plates - very Unenvironmentally friendly...) and paper cups. Still , beautiful place to be at. I see people doing take away of their cupcakes in very large numbers. I would say that the cupcakes are pretty but fairly much on the normal side of things. Have yet to try their delicious looking cakes and pastries. Saw a poster recently to say that they do breakfast/brunch now. Look forward to going back :)",

A bakery cum cafe, the place is decorated in a way that allure you to instagram every single corner. They have seats in front of the bakery; even a swing if you prefer. Step further in, you're brought to the food display! Loved the look of everything! Even the glimpse of cake pans and baking tools in their huge cupboard was instagram-worthy. Haha! Kudos to whoever the interior designer was.They sell, tarts, cakes, brownies and etc. Even cookie and cake mixes in jars. How wonderful! But what captivated us the most were the cupcakes on display. Me being the salted caramel lover ordered 2 of those, vanilla and hazelnut chocolate ones. Prices for the cupcakes were alright, standard. But the drinks! Blimey! $7 for a cup of lemonade? Eh?! And oh! You might as well know that they don't offer you any paper bag to stuff your cake boxes. They'll just tie them up with a string to act as a handle. Quite the hassle if you're already holding many things in hand.",

The charming entrance greets you warmly with an army of vintage aqua bikes, an open communal dining space and a glass tankard of lemon scented water (they understand the effects of humidity!) The shop itself is lined with daily specials, old favourites and row upon row of Plain Vanilla's famous cupcakes - to me, these are definitely the best cupcakes in Singapore!They have a great texture and deviate away from being outlandishly sweet; I love that every flavour says what it means and means what it says. Must-trys are the Earl Grey and Cinnamon! The cupcakes start from $3.50 each and I usually grab a box of 6; just like the Sound of Music, they're adorably tied up with string! (A useful handle for when you're commuting with cupcakes!) I love the ritual of hopping a few doors down to Books Actually to grab some reading material and then settling myself into a quiet corner at PV Bakery. Although the seating is limited and they don't do coffees (yet!), it's none the less a beautiful space to wind down in. Be sure to check out their mini concept store for little trinkets and gifts before you leave!",

Prices are pretty average for this kind of place but slightly pricy \u00a0for our expectations (we spent around 25 \u20ac in coffee and cakes for two) it is definitely worth a visit while in this area of the city though. We had a red velvet cupcake (good one btw), lemon tart, flourless chocolate cake, ice latte and ginger lemonade (quite refreshing one). I would definitely come back !.

I love the open look to this spot, and you really get to feel the space as you walk in. You don't need that much more when all you want is to eat a cupcake, right?The flavours are stellar as always, and I'm a big fan of the dark chocolate cupcake with Varlrona chocolate nibs, maybe because I think it's the manliest cupcake there - dark chocolate, and brown, muted colours - but then again, it's just so dang delicious. And those nibs add that crunch and a touch of that bittersweet raw chocolate finish... I think I'm saying too much.In fact, every one I've tried is tasty as heck, and with well-made classic flavour pairings like cinnamon brown sugar, strawberry white chocolate and milk chocolate banana, it's hard not to like everything you eat.This new store in Tiong Bahru is on the same street as the massively hip bookstore BooksActually, and also picturebook mecca Woods in the Books, not to mention earlybirds 40 Hands, you'll have your weekend needs covered just wandering down this stretch.",

The counter space allows us to stand in front and ponder. Her selection as always, spoils us like an only child in the family. I am always drawn to a salted caramel or special of the day. A new old favourite is earl grey lavender cuppie. An old because I always had it in USA but never in Singapore. Thank you for bringing it here. Have yet to attend her events.
