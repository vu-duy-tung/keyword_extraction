The food are truly amazing and good representation of Singapore street food. I did not have the stomach to try out all the stalls. I will post again when I am here for meals next time.",

    "text": "For the experience itself, this is a pretty nice area to stop by after you're done with the Singapore Flyer. Situated right under the Flyer, this entire area is located on the first floor. Modeled similar to a hawker centre, you'll see different food stalls lined up. Prices here are a wee bit higher than the usual stalls at other hawker centers. For the food options, there is a huge array of typical Singaporean dishes, some Indonesian food, Chinese and desserts. For food, I tried the laksa (prawn noodle soup) and found it quite lack luster. The broth was blander than expected and not worth the price. As for the dessert, I tried the ice ball and found this to be pretty unique!! The ice is shaved and used to form the ball. Within the ball, are a variety of different jello like things and red bean. For the different colors, each syrup had a unique taste to it. I highly suggest trying out this dessert if you're in doubt of trying other dishes. Another suggestion I have is, when in doubt at what to eat, follow the locals and see where they line up or what the majority of the people are eating. This usually indicates if the food is good / popular and most of the time, you really can't go wrong :)",

Most of the stands were open at this time so there was quite a bit of selection to choose from! I'd recommend dining at these food plazas when in Singapore since it's a great way to sample some Asian cuisine! (They're pretty much everywhere and some are even open for 24 hours!)I ordered the roasted chicken over rice dish since I was craving it and I wanted to try a legit version besides the ones I've eaten on the plane, lol! Anyway this place is filled with cheap eats!!!! The chicken and rice dish I ordered was under $2USD *good portion and I was able to eat more after my walk to the Marina*!",

The local prawn noodle at Newton's tasted like Raid Ant Spray. We were given food vouchers as part of tour and had $20 SIN dollar to spend. For the rest, I spent it on drinks and Satay at the Old Airport Road stall. Overall, unappetizing and disappointed.",

It does offer a reasonable selection of local foods at reasonable prices. I got the minced meat noodles. It was good. Not AMAZING, like i have had elsewhere in singapore, but i have realized that if you can name the place easily on a site like Yelp, then it probably isn't going to be amazing. It's good enough though if you are looking for things like bak kut teh, oyster omelet, grilled seafood skewers, etc.",

    "text": "I have always wanted to visit the Singapore Food Trail, which is a 1960s themed food street at Singapore Flyer and Food Republic Beer Garden at Harbourfront when they opened in early 2011. There was much hype when they opened but it seemed to have died down. Before this, our visit to the Food Republic Beer Garden was disappointing as only a few stalls were opened on a weekend evening and the customers were sparse.In fact, I have forgotten about this place until I chanced upon an ongoing promotion through its Facebook page recently. One item from each stall was at $2.50 instead of $5--cheaper than those at most Food Republic food courts. Since there are substantial savings, I decided why not head there for a try?The noodles of the Satay Bee Hoon ($2.50) are well-strained so it was not too wet. More of that piquant gravy would be wonderful. Apparently, the stall that began since 1950s is famous for its gravy made from 15 ingredients, but lard is no longer used.The East Coast Lagoon Rojak was the star of that day. To be honest, we liked it more than the Kovan Rojak because the sauce had the right consistency and a well-balance sweet and tangy taste. The best thing was the you tiao (dough fritters) which stayed fresh and crunchy till the endInstead of Sambal stingray, we ordered the Yang Zhou Fried Rice from Boon Tat Street BBQ since it was the dish on offer at $2.50. Nonetheless, the rice was fluffy and spicy, with a strong whiff of wok hei.From the Bugis Street Ah Huat Hainanese Chicken Rice stall, we ordered half-a-chicken instead of the $2.50 plate of chicken rice as the Folks wanted more meat. The meat was tender and good, but not much different from those outside. Conclusion: Food here are delicious and it is a relief to see that most stalls are still manned by Singaporeans--the owners or their relatives. Price wise, they are similar to Food Republic without using the discounts. But many of the stalls were either closed (eg. Ann Chin Popiah ) or had permanently stopped operations. With an air of gloomy atmosphere among the hawkers, I hoped that the online promotions (till May 31st) can help to improve the business. But whether such concepts are sustainable in the long run remain a question",

Got a laksa from one of the stalls (can't recall which) - really wasn't to my liking so it got tossed. Ended up just getting a garlic naan from the Indian stall (yum - but I guess you can't really go wrong with naan). Conveniently close enough to the hotel to walk (albeit, and outdoors sweaty walk). However, next time, I'll just head to the esplanade hawker instead.",
