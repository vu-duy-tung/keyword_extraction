One bite, you can taste the wok-hei, the crunchiness (the bean sprouts, garlic & tiny bits or pork lard), and the moistness the noodles & cockles. Sweet heaven! I always need to restraint myself in this Bedok South Market. Go on vegetarian diet for a month, then allocate calories to Hill Street Fried Kway Teow.I rarely queue for food. No matter how good it is. If the waiting is too long, I'd just eat something else.Still, this is one of the few CKT that is worth the calories & cholesterol.",

However, the quality has dropped since the old old uncle has retired, and his son (?) took over. The noodles are underfried, and are a little soggier than before. The flavor is still there, but because it is wetter, it is not as awesome as the old uncle's frying. I ate this when it was only $2. Now it's $3.50 or $4 for a plate...",

    "text": "Some like it dryer, some like it a little bit more wet; all a personal preference. I like mine a little more wet with big juicy blood cockles (aka seahum).I had this when they were still really at Hill Street. I remember really enjoying it there. After years of mostly trying to avoid this dish for health issues, i very occasionally dig in to this once or twice year only.The queue here is always long and I bought the biggest baddest plate they got which was the $4 portion with an added $1 for seahum totalling to $5. Still tasty, has the wokhei taste people look for in this dish, but not so wet with eggy goodness as it was before. The seahum that day was lacklustre to say the least. Small and shrivelled.Although the queues here still snake till the moment they off their lights... I feel it has turned average. Still better than many of the new unknowns, but definitely no where as good as they were before.3.2 Stars",

    "text": "Once or if we're lucky, twice every year we get to fly to the Food Paradise that is Singapore. This is one of our \"go to\" food centres when we're in Singapore.Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes and although the Char Kway Teow was good here, I don't think the massive line represents how good it was in regards to others we went to and isn't always a measure of quality.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality.Char Kway Teow is a wok fried dish and usually is served with some sort of seafood and can vary from having an array of prawns, to squid and cockles (a type of shell fish) with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the \"Wok Hei\" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.Although the flavours balanced very well, the Wok Hei wasn't as noticeable and prominent as some hawkers, it was still beautifully crafted and as much as the Wok Hei is important to the overall flavour of the dish, the little bits of pork lard are a signature too and an absolute must which there was plenty of. If you like it a little spicy, ask for chilli when ordering.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Char Kway Teow and it's getting more and more difficult to find really good ones in Singapore. For me if it hasn't got Wok Hei, it makes the difference between good and impressive and this lacked that substance and pow that you get when the Wok Hei is infused to perfection. Given Hill Streets Kway Teow's reputation and a glimpse of how good it could be from my taste, I'll be back again to confirm whether it was an \"off\" day or not but with a 20 minute line, if it's not stellar next time, I won't be back.Cheers!Dave.",

So you can imagine, I was really excited when I got to try the Hill Street Char Kway Teow. It's pretty flavourful. The kway teow was done well and blended well in the soy sauce with the generous serving of ingredients - beansprouts, chinese sausage, clams, chives, etc.It was a little underwhelming though, because I've heard SO MUCH about it. But it is still in all a decent plate of CKT. My final verdict: I won't travel for it, but if I happen to be in the area, I'll be happy to tuck into a plate of this local classic. You should decide for yourself too!",

The standard of the Fried Kway Teow remains the same, not suffering any dip in form and has been consistently ranked among the best, if not the best in Singapore. The long queues are quite annoying as waiting times can sometime be up to 30mins or more for just one plate of fried kway teow. The food centre itself is fairly huge, with ample seating, but because it shares the space with a wet market, it might not be the most conducive place to have it at.",
