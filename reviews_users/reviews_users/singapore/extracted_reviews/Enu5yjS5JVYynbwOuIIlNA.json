    "text": "This is pure comfort food.The best order dishes for me are:- samsui chicken- ah kong fan shu ye (spicy sweet potato leaves)- tofu in claypot- soup (optional)The samsui chicken is always so tender, and when wrapped in the lettuce with ginger, it is so crisp and refreshing.The spicy sweet potato leaves and tofu just go very well with rice. Perfect to share the dishes.There are also individual portions - but there are only 3 options for the rice with chicken dish. I will say don't bother with those and grab your friends to dine with you or just order the samsui chicken and pack the leftover in a doggy bag.",

With various set dinners that are good for groups, nobody will leave hungry. I would recommend getting the Samsui Chicken which comes with a really good ginger sauce. Also, the soups aren't half bad. Protip: The peanuts they serve at the start cost an arm and leg, send it back and save some $$$.",

On my recent visit I had the Samsui Chicken, Venison with ginger and spring onions, fried rice, green beans, and the fried mee. The ginger sauce that comes with the chicken is bomb, possibly highlight of the meal. The venison was also great; it's super tender. The only thing that didn't do it for me was the mee; I'll passs next time. I'll definitely come back especially considering it was very affordable at well under $20 a person.",
