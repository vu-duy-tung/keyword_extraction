Chicken and rice was fresh and hot. Restaurant is tucked away on Arab street across from the Park Royal hotel and hence on a quieter street. They do not serve beer but one can sit at the Italian restaurant next door for beer and get served food from Tabouleh...",

    "text": "Tabbouleh has sooo much potential and from the two times I've eaten here it's because I've craved for their dish, tabbouleh- a fine balance of parsley, bulgar, tomatoes, onions and lemon juice- decent price for a fairly large portion.Their chicken fatteh was OK- while the taste was pretty solid, I just was not expecting everything to be absolutely drenched in the yogurt. Most recently, however, I tried their shish tawouk and was so let down with their portion size. I did get takeaway, so perhaps not indicative of presentation and serving style while dining in, but I received incredibly soggy fries, some smothered in mayo, with a super tiny wrap smushed on top to fit in the otherwise already tiny container. $10 for this was definitely overpriced.The hummus is still always highly regarded, so I will still come back for my tabbouleh desires and try another appetizer when the craving calls.",

It's an open air place, and even though they do have AC units, it didn't feel very cool at all.Service was a bit inattentive, even though it was just my mom and I. I had to walk to the back to get the server's attention to take our orders and get our bill.For starters we ordered hummus with some bread on the side; this turned out pretty decently. The hummus portion was generous and we were able to take it home with us.I ordered a chicken shawarma, and my mom, the beef. Portion-wise it was puny, and I found my chicken a bit dry. Maybe that's why they served it with a heap of french fries. At least the fries were good.I still stand by my tip that the watermelon juice is refreshing. Do order that if you end up here, especially on hot days!",

So, I ordered the tabbouleh, Kibbeh, grilled halumi, and hummus, which were spot on!! Obviously since the restaurant is on Arab St, they do not serve alcohol. The food is worth every penny not to consume alcohol or think about it! The Kibbeh is fresh, hot and absolutely delicious.",

We prefer Lebanese hummus because it's smooth and creamy. \u00a0It's a great value for what you get -- pita comes for free when you order hummus and other appetizer dips so that saves money. I *think* prices are inclusive of GST and service because whenever I get the bill I'm pleasantly surprised. \u00a0There aren't so many exotic decorations, and it's fairly simple setting. They stick to good food served fresh: warm dolmas, freshly made pizza-like with lamb, good hummus, etc. You could pay more to get a Middle Eastern ambience with carpets or tiles or fancy decorations, but if you're more interested in getting good solid food with good service at decent prices, this is the place to go.",

Maybe I got them on a bad night but it certainly made mine worse.",
