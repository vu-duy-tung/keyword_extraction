They are quite short staffed, got to wait for service when the restaurant is full. We ordered the daejang jigae, bbq pork, dry cold noodle and a bottle of soju, all very delicious and reminded me of the Korean food I had back in the US. Would definitely come back again.",

    "text": "Update 18 June 2017Beef bulgogi ($13 + $2 rice ++) - 3 starsI was craving this so I ordered it again despite the mediocre rating I gave it below. Well, I was right. The meat is too fatty.Spicy seafood and mushroom noodle soup ($13++) - 1.5 starsThis was sort of like a Korean ban mian. The soup tasted great but after a while the noodles absorbed the soup and the starch from the noodles made the soup unpleasantly thick. Not many ingredients. I'd much rather get the sundubu the next time.Service - 5 starsThey took the initiative to move us from the bar to a table once a table opened up and were generous with the banchan refills!$33 for the two dishes.Update 9 April 2017Fishcake soup ($8) - 3 starsThe soup was alright. The fishcake inside is like the one in the banchan though with 2 additional varieties. Sort of like a Korean yong tau foo/ngoh hiang-type fishcake. We ordered this and the bulgogi since we weren't that hungry. These two dishes and the banchan were enough for us.Original reviewBanchan - 2 starsVariety is decent but each dish isn't spectacular.Beef stew - 2.5 starsToo sweet!Beef bulgogi ($13) - 3 starsFlavor was okay. We shared between the 3 of us and the size was about right, though. Stir it quickly so the bottom doesn't burn.Seafood pancake ($16) - 2.75 starsKind of thick and bland without the sauce.Fishcake soup/stew ($28) - 3 starsThe fishcake was strung on the skewers. Tasted like Japanese fishcake (oden) or the fishcake you get as banchan.Persimmon punch - 0 starsThe cinnamon was way too strong even after diluting it with water! I couldn't take more than a sip.On the plus side overall it seems like they use less MSG than Kim's and Togi but more than Woorinara (I still downed a lot of water during dinner). But the dishes just weren't impressive to me. My friends love this place and much prefer it to Kim's and Woorinara. I'm still unimpressed by all the Korean places I've been to in Singapore and miss the ones in LA/Southern California.",

    "text": "Nothing quite rocks my boat like Korean homestyle cooking. We joined our Korean friends who swear by this place as being their go-to place for homestyle comfort food. They tell me 3 Meals A Day is a Korean reality comedy cooking show but don't think it has anything to do with it. The food here is no joke.We arrived right when they pulled up their window blinds and flipped the OPEN sign. We did have a reservation for a Saturday but by the time 6:15 rolled around, every seat was already taken. Really enjoyed the kimchi as part of the banchan set. No harsh fermented taste like how kimchi can taste at other places. I think this is the first time I only went one round on the banchans because there was simply too much food.The Nakji Bokkem (stir-fried spicy octopus) came out shortly after ordering. Nakji Bokkeum is one of my favorite dish in Korean cuisine. It creates a perfect harmony out of the two things I love most - seafood and spiciness. After taking the obligatory Yelp pics from every angle, we dug in and absolutely enjoyed this spicy dish. I don't know what it is about Korean chili sauce that makes the food taste so good. It's the kind of fiery spice with a hint of sweetness. Vegetables were not overcooked and held their crispness and the octopus was nice and tender. It wasn't until we dug in deeper that we realize there was mound of noodles underneath. Yum!The Jap Chae (Korean glass noodles) was very nice. The foundation of the dish - soy sauce, garlic, and sesame oil - came through nicely. I hate dry Jap Chae because the noodles continue to absorb moisture even after cooking, but the Jap Chae here was warm and moist, and went well with the other dishes we ordered.Finally, the large order of Bossam (boiled pork) arrived and that's when I got really excited. I realized boiled pork doesn't sound very appetizing but I've been told that although it sounds like a simple dish to make, it requires some skill to make right. The dish here was flavorful and tender. One can tell that they took their time in brining the pork and removing any bad smell/taste that can accompany bossam made in a rush. The thinly sliced pork was served with both raw and parboiled veggie leaves for wrapping along with the sides of ssamjang, sliced green chilies, raw garlic and kimchi. You won't find anything to barbecue here so your clothes will be safe and sound. The service was good but could use a little more proactive attention. Will have to come back to try their fried chicken, jjigaes, and Korean sashimi. Jal meogeosseumnida!",

    "text": "Decently good Korean food with some hits and misses.The name of the place is based on a popular Korean reality cooking show (Samsi Sekki) of the same name. The restaurant was rather crowded on a weekend evening, which raised my expectations somewhat. The banchan (side dishes) were pretty good and I appreciated the variety. I ordered the dolsot bibimbap (mixed rice in a stone pot), fried chicken (with spicy sauce) and haemul pajeon (seafood pancake). Although rather tasty, I felt the stone pot wasn't heated thoroughly. The rice touching the bowl wasn't crisp at all. I was also left looking around for the raw egg...The fried chicken was much better, crisp batter and tender on the inside, coated with a rather spicy sauce. The seafood pancake was run of the mill, but there was nothing much else to complain about.The usual Korean fare is served here, and I feel it borders on the 3.5 star mark, but with the wallet friendly prices I think I might round it up to a 4. I'm not sure why Korean food is also rather expensive in Singapore. Thumbs up to lower prices.",

The fish cake soup is a little high on the MSG though. But if you are feeling cold and wanted something soupy, good to swing by here",

    "text": "After years of being spoilt by the Korean food in SoCal, we were hoping to find a half decent place in SIngapore. We went in with high expectations as several pictures/reviews looked good. We ordered 4 dishes - Japchae, Bulgogi, Kimchijeon, and a cabbage and beef shank stew.Japchae - I really like Japchae and have a low bar for it but the balance was totally off on this one. It was too sweet and WET (a la fried hokkien prawn noodles). Insufficient umami and balance (no pepper taste at all), and no meat in it either.Bulgogi - This was pretty bad as well. It came out with an unappetizing grey color and my first thoughts were \"no sesame seeds and scallions?\". I've never eaten bulgogi without sesame seeds which made me doubt the quality/authenticity of this place. It tasted as bad as it looked. The marinade was watered down and very simple, and frankly I have made better at home. Completely missed the intense sweet/salty flavor characteristic of this dish. The beef cut was super lean and tough as well and made for a terrible dish. Kimchijeon - This was passable though not great in any sense. The pajeon mix was too sticky and felt slightly undercooked. The dip was also wrong, tasted like ponzu when it should be predominantly salty and spicy. Also no green onions or sesame seeds in it again? What's with the skimping on basics?Cabbage and beef shank soup - Never had this before. Soup flavor was not bad but there was almost no meat in it, by that I mean If you pieced all the meat in the bowl together you would get about 2 fifty cent coins worth of volume. I'm ok if you don't put meat in your jjigaes but if you are going to advertise a soup with \"beef shank\" in the name you had better put a fair amount in. For $20 I would never order this again.Banchan - We had 6 banchan, a macaroni salad, egg omelette (somewhat like tamagoyaki), beansprouts, baby anchovies, fish cake and kimchi. None of them were really anything to shout about. In particular, Korean fishcake already has a heavy flour component compared to the local stuff, but this one tasked like 90% flour and felt like we were eating mock meat. Urgh.All in all, the food was not good for the price and I probably wouldn't come back. The fact that this place gets 4 stars on Yelp is testament to the sorry state of Korean food in Singapore.",
