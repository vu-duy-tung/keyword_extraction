    "text": "Have been going there for last 2 years and must say that things have only gotten better. They have new pizzas and beer to match these. New desserts and new starters as well.Recently, attended the sausage festival where their handmade sausages of chicken, pork and lamb were a big hit. They were very tasty and had a good spice flavour.Biramisu - Their version of tiramisu using beer, is still as excellent as ever. Well, the only difference is that now one needs to make a reservation before going else you will be disappointed as the place is usually full quite a lot of times that i have been there.Keep it up!!",

I've had the margherita and truffle- despite the thicker than expected crusts, they were still light to eat and both selections were excellent. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "We arrived very late, most places in the alley had closed shop for the night and we just tried our luck and asked whether they were still open and served food.Yes they were, but pizza only - exactly what we wanted. My heart leaped for joy when I saw that they actually had a true wood fire oven at the back.We went for the draft beer, which our very nice server recommended, and ordered pizza capricciosa and a margarita. Priced at 20 S$++ for my margarita, as the least expensive on the menu, it is on the medium to upper end of the spectrum.The pale ale arrived shortly thereafter and tasted wonderfully fruity. The pizzas did not take long either and I honestly don't think I have had such a good pizza for a long time. This place is a little out of my way but I would always gladly return!",

Tastes fine if that's what you know you are getting.GNOCCHI MELANZANE BUFALA E POMODORINI - overcooked and soggy.TRUFFLE PIZZA - gratuitous use of the main ingredient, again, if that's what you want then you will be happy. Although I find excessive use of truffles is like taking a blunderbuss approach to cooking.I don't think they understand what makes a good pizza. Stick to their products which come in bottles - they have a nice selection of beers.",

The service was really good even though it did take a little longer for food to arrive but it was a fairly busy time for them. I simply loved their bruschetta..it has the classic tomatoes, one piece with pumpkin cream and another with ricotta. Amazing! we had both pizzas and pastas and everything was really good. My favorite was the snow peas and potato pizza..weird for a pizza but oh so good! And ended we a saffron panna cotta and a chocolate Java cake which all of us will go back for!!",

No real meat or veggie dishes, without carbs or dairy.So, when my freind invited me last night and said it was highly recommended, I cringed!Then when I finished my dinner, I was pleasantly suprised.THere were only 2 meat based mains.Ribeye and Seabass.I ordered the seabass. encrusted with zucchini and served with a tomatoe salsa. it was a good 150gs, and tasty.Apparently, the ribeye was 300gm, which would have been too much.It was Very nice! Healthy, light and perfect!My freind and others told me that their pizzas were absolute junk, but I can't and won't confirm that.My friends both ordered pastas. The portions were generous, for pastas, (but since I don't eat carbs, what do I know?), and they said the flavours were pretty good.We ordered a tiramisu with coffee and been infused and even though I couldn't eat it, \u00a0my freinds said it was average at best, and that the addition of the coffee and beer ruined it.Overall, the ambience was nothing memorable, although they blared radio music, which was beyond strange and a tab uncomfortable.It's definitely the last time I'll dine there.",

    "text": "I grapple between 4 and 5 stars, this is definitely a 4.5 star place in my book. Just opened for 2 months, this place had showed great promise when we walked past it a month ago. The draw is wood-fired pizza but surprisingly, I enjoyed the pastas better than the pizzas. More importantly, this modern chic italian joint serves a good variety of both craft beers and wines, which is rare for italian restaurants, and they believe in beer and food pairings instead of just the typical wine and food. Also, the prices for the mains are well priced for a nice restaurant, ranging from 18-24 bucks for a very generous portion of food. I had the homemade gnocchi with eggplant and olives and the sauce was sublime. The gnocchi was soft and starchy and the sauce was obviously home-made with cherry tomatoes and eggplant. The pasta with bolognese sauce was excellent as well, a respectable home-made sauce worthy of Bologna, and pasta was served al dente. The husband really liked the four cheese pizza, I liked the taste of the gorgonzola cheese of it, but I had it when it was already slightly cold so could have been better. The green pea soup of the day had a really well-balanced taste of pea with a hint of mint, really tasty albeit a little watery (more pea please!). This is our new favorite italian restaurant in Singapore. Oh, and if you are a fan of bloody marys, you HAVE to try their italian bloody mary, it is divine.",
