    "text": "Did a walk-in here on a Thursday night, for two.Japanese-fusion sort of place, in a little alley. Sounds like a clich\u00e9, hey?This place is actually decent. Okay food, okay service, okay decor, okay toilets, okay everything (okay maybe, soso drinks). I'm just unsure if the prices here actually give value, which is the main driver of my reviews.We had the chirashi don, some signature maki, an onsen egg each (what is with the dashi JELLY?!), wine, and my greatest disappointment, my shiso martini. A martini with a shiso leaf in, makes it a shiso martini, NOT. This is partially my fault for having high hopes. I once had the greatest shiso drink ever, and I was hoping to recreate that moment/feeling/taste. Okay reminiscence over. The food here is generally acceptable, fish is acceptably fresh, but nothing is a great stand-out. A very minor grouse, I dislike the black napkins here, because I can't gauge how clean my mouth is when I wipe it or if I need to reapply some lippie. I think women who wear lipstick might agree with me, but I'm just nitpicking.Would I come back? Maybe.",

    "text": "If you are looking for delicate flavors and intimate conversation, TFS is your spot! Food here is a little pricy but really depends on how you order. Instead of getting sushi or rolls, we opted for small plates and entr\u00e9es to share. The Onsen Tamago is the BOMB! I don't know how they make it but it is this heavenly mix of salmon roe, spring egg, seaweed, spring onion, and some sort of jelly. Also recommend their udon linguine with clam and vegi, very light yet balanced. Besides these two, we ordered seafood salad, fried truffle prawn as well as fried chicken, all pretty good.Cocktails are delicious but the prices are on the higher end. I got two earl grey martinis and they are about $19 each.The light was soft but not too dark. The night we were here they were playing pop and rock ballads from Sam Smith, Goo goo dolls and alike. Super intimate and great for date night!",

    "text": "I was here a couple of nights ago with some friends, and this place really reminds me of Asian fusion places in the states. You get sushi rolls and $26 entrees and the standard Asian fusion appetizers. We tried the chirashi bowl, ramen aglio olio with foie gras and smoked duck, as well as the miso cod.The miso cod was really good, portion size is pretty small but unsurprising given how miso cods are always served in really tiny portions in restaurants. I tried making miso cod once, and to stick it to restaurants' faces I made quite a large portion, and it ended up kinda jelat with all the sweet seasoning, so maybe that's why. TFS's miso cod was very tender and well marinated, would definitely recommend it if you're half hungry. Otherwise it'll only make you hungrier.The ramen was somewhat of a disappointment. The smoked duck was too dry, I presume they saut\u00e9ed it as well with the ramen but that process probably drained out some of the juices. There were 2 tiny tiny pieces of foie gras, which given the price of the dish seems slightly unreasonable. I mean it's literally fried instant ramen, so that's probably not where the cost went. That leaves the 3-4 pieces of smoked duck and 2 pieces of foie gras the size of my thumb. Which makes it the most expensive piece of foie gras I ever ate. The sushi looks fresh though, and their uni dishes look pretty good though I didnt try it. Basically, if you have cash to blow, definitely come here for the great sushi and fresh seafood. Otherwise, you'll be somewhat disappointed.",

    "text": "Really not worth it. So what's the fuss with this whole Japanese fusion thing? Been there and done that, and Friend, if you can't do it well, please don't do it at all. First off, the collection of Asahi beer deserves a pat on the back. I recommend trying the Asahi Black, a bit like Guinness but with more of a punch. Service-wise...uh, we did have to pay 10% for that, right? I'm so tired of going to restaurants when the server has no idea what's going on, takes 10 minutes to bring in an associate to explain, and this associate has no idea that I can spot bull all the way to KL. There was one Australian (?) server who was pretty knowledgeable though he left mid-way through our meal. The sashimi platter was good but definitely not as fresh as other places I've tried. I would say the sashimi at TFS is aligned with Sakae Sushi but with prices aligned with Sushi Tei. Out of the 7 tapas we tried, I only really enjoyed the truffle fried ebi. But I enjoy everything with truffle oil so no crowd pleaser here. Am I being too mean here? Wweeelll...I def. won't come back here again. After a meal that left all four of us hungry, we stopped by WaBar for a real dinner. TFS certainly made me appreciate Tanuki more than ever--for the prices, creativity, and fusion. Well done Tanuki, and keep on trying TFS.",

    "text": "I have always wanted to use the term 'hole in the wall' in my review and The Flying Squirrel is indeed a hole in the wall. It is situated just off the main Amoy street and well signposted so you wouldn't miss it. The decor of this place is cosy and perfect for a quiet gathering with friends. They have a happy hour too so that definitely doesn't hurt.The portions here are quite small but served beautifully, and are good for sharing or having on your own. The absolute must try here is the onsen tamago. Absolutely delicate and tasty! As for the other dishes that we tried, I think that they were not bad, but nothing that you couldn't get from other Japanese restaurants in Singapore. We tried the hotate and salmon sushi here and they were alright. The level of freshness was acceptable for the price but nothing to shout about. The other dishes that we tried were the gyoza, curry rice, udon pasta , truffled ebi fry (nice enough but we couldn't taste even a hint of truffle) and they were fine. I don't mind them but I will possibly try other dishes on the menu on my next visit.No complaints about the service here. They were polite and efficient. The nice ambience, speedy service, onsen tamago and happy hour will bring me back! The Flying Squirrel is small so reservations are highly recommended.",

    "text": "While waiting for our seats at the Market Grill, I decided to check out the Flying Squirrel since I passed it during a fun Friday a few weeks back. The entire restaurant was booked up but the waitress, who knows how to work a business, said I could have 2 bar seats before an 8.45 reservation. I thought some parts of the menu looked interesting and gave those items a try. \u00a0We had the grilled fugu and it was delicious and quite a steal. The dude said \u00a0it tasted like fish jerky while I put it down to FISH BAK KWA. Complete with wide eyes and lick of the lips. The (I think) slightly fermented octopus and cucumber was a refreshing version of kimchi and was very small even for a bar bite. We rounded things off with chicken karaage as a tummy filler. Quite a poor cousin of 5 Izakaya's version but then again, most places do crappy soggy fried chicken these days.For drinks, I tried the yuzu prosecco, which was not as sweet as I expected (in a good way). The drink as a whole was light, fresh and balanced and a perfect starter to a meal. The dude had a pint of Asahi and there were no complaints there. Overall the food & drink did the job.",

The first time we came, I ordered the TFS chirashi and my husband got the TFS maki. Around $20 for each of these,the price is a bit steep, but I thought the chirashi bowl was well worth it. You get a lot of fish and not too much rice, so you feel like you're getting your money's worth :) Not only that but the chirashi bowl is like an explosion of flavors with sweet sauce from the eel combined with bursting of the salmon roe and the sashimi, it's pretty amazing. So the next time we went to the restaurant, we both ordered the chirashi bowl :)",
