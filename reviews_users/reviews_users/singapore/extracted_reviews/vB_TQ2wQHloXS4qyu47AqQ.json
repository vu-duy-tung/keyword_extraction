Plaza Singapura location was crowded and service was very busy. Heerens location is by far the best one. It is hidden in the basement level next to housewares. Plus it has the cheesy gyoza!",

The gyoza sauce was a bit on the salty side. I also ordered the black truffle ramen. The portion was small but it came with juicy pork belly, perfectly soft boiled egg, and tons of black truffle! I was pleasantly surprised and would totally reorder this entire meal.",

    "text": "I love love love gyozas and this is THE best place in singapore for gyozasThe skin is thin, the filling fresh and tasty and the little bundles of goodness fried to perfection -- With just the right amount of crisp on one side. My two favourites are the pork and the veggie gyozas. The prawn gyoza is ok but i didnt like the crab at all. Every now and then, theyll come up with some funky flavors like curry chicken (so-so) but i know better now and stick with my usuals.Also recommended: the garlic fried fried rice, chicken karage, whitebait, chicken cartilege.Surprisingly, the mixed sashimi platter is pretty fresh and affordable at $28. Theres a special for a bucket of kirins ($25+) but sake is on the pricey side. I wasnt impressed with the salad, edamame (tasted like the frozen ones from ntuc) or the jya jya mienWould give it 5 stars if the other dishes were as good as the gyozas.",

It's a small portion but the price is not high too lah. Tori Karaage - very deep fried but a tad tasteless leh. Rather disappointing...Ramen - they only have one type of ramen. The texture of the ramen is quite QQ so not bad actually. The broth is also the thick pork-based one. My girl actually wanted a whole bowl by herself. Of course we had Gyoza too and yes yes, the Gyozas were very nice. Crispy base and soft steamed dumplings tops and flavourful fillings!! Not sure if I'll return again for a full meal but yes, the Gyozas are worth checking out at least as a snack.",

    "text": "Amazing gyoza place hidden at the corner of Basement 1 of Robinsons Orchard (formerly known as The Heeren). \u00a0One of the many things I like about this place is how quiet this place is everytime I visit. Don't get me wrong. It is not entirely quiet (as in no customer) kinda quiet but it's the certain \"zen\" that it exudes the minute I stepped in to this restaurant. First off - \u00a0no queue. And second - price is reasonable. And third - good food. Go straight to the superstar when you order - Pork Gyoza either panfried or boil, depending what you fancy. If you want something other than pork, the Prawn gyoza is a good choice too. Besides gyoza, the waitress would recommend you an in house special called jia jia men, a noodle dish which is pretty similiar with the taiwanese version (jia xiang mien). I dont like it as i felt it lacked of taste but found myself ordering my last two recent visits. (i have no hope, i know). Upon serving you jiajia men, the waitress will tell you to mix everything in the bowl and once you're done eating half portion of the noodle, she will then add in \"hot soup\" to it and a half boiled egg into the soup. So for the price of one, you get to enjoy the dry version and then the soup version. Selling at $6.50 per portion, I thought it's a pretty good deal. If you;re still not full, the garlic fried rice and the Nikujyaga (braised beef in stock, i think) are pretty decent. I would def come back from time to time.",

I am usually not a fan of gyoza as it is usually sticky, mushy or has a thick layer of dough.I am pretty much blown away with the gyoza here. The dumpling is nicely crisped on one side. The skin is very thin so you do have to deal with chewing through to reach the filling. I had the pork gyoza so the meat was moist and very juicy. Dip it into the sauce and topped with ginger and you have a winner. There are 3 types of fillings now - pork, vegetables and prawns.I also tried the jyajya \u00a0men. I was curious about it as there was an instruction sheet on each table on how to enjoy it to its maximum. It was basically chewy noodles with miso paste, minced meat and green onions. Add vinegar and chili oil (or chili flakes) to taste. I found that to be a bit on the bland side, maybe I did not add enough \u00a0seasoning. Halfway through the noodles, you could add the soft boiled egg (the server would bring it over when you tell them you wish to have the egg), more miso paste and a bit of the noodle water to have a soupy eggy noodle. This was much better as the additional miso paste did give more taste to the noodle. The highlight is still the gyoza. Order a plate or three. It is that good. The pan-fried version that is.",

The skin was thin and crispy and the filling tasty and balanced. I also had the boiled crab gyoza and while they were really nice, I still preferred the fried pork ones but this might just be personal preference.A nice plus is their condiments: they have a range of condiments (including sliced ginger - my fave) \u00a0on the table so you can mix your own dipping sauce (in my case: heaps and heaps of ginger with black vinegar and a dash of chili oil). Additionally I also had the clam dish (I believe it was called LaLa soup) which was very average, nothing too special to it.Would I go back? YES, I would definitely make a detour for this to fix my dumpling craving!",

    "text": "Gyoza, usually a side dish at Izakaya or ramen-ya, becomes the leading star at Gyoza-ya. Having opened at the old Heeren since last year, it has introduced new items to meet the ever-changing consumers' tastebuds. One of my favourites picks was the all-new Crab Gyoza $7.80, an interesting and flavourful twist to the traditional meat filling. Made with fresh crab instead of frozen crab meat, each dumpling is wrapped with the exact same amount of filling, churned and measured to perfection by the machine.The other new dish is the Tonkatsu Udon ($6.80). The creamy broth tasted like Ban Mian Soup--light but no less oily than a Tonkotsu ramen. The \"udon\" belongs to the flatter Kishimen Udon that is popular in Iwate prefecture. It resembles Ban Mian, but softer in texture.Pan fried food tends to win over steamed or boiled ones because they have the extra fragrant burnt aroma. But hey, the Boiled Pork Gyozas($4.80) are not too bad either. Succulent and well-seasoned, the skin is just slightly thicker thus chewier than Xiao Long Bao. I thought the chefs were pretty clever to drizzle them in sweet miso sauce. Too much meat? There is always the Vegetable Pan Fried Gyozas($4.80), just as freshly made like their gyoza siblings.  If you like unfiltered sake, this is one of the places in Singapore that actually imports this premium brew from Japan.Gyoza-ya also prides itself as being the first to serve this Jya Jya Men($6.50) in Singapore. Not to be confused with the typical Chinese or Korean bean paste noodles, Jya Jya Men is an Iwate prefecture delicacy that ranks together with Wanko Soba and Rei Men (Cold Noodles) as Morioka's Top three Noodles.What's the difference? The noodles and the way of eating. Either Kishimen aka flat udon (same as the Tonkatsu Udon) or the usual thick udon, are topped with Minced Meat Miso & Cucumber and eaten with chilli oil and vinegar. After emptying the noodles, the staff will add a soft-boiled egg, more miso minced meat and some boiling water that was used to cooked the udon. Stir everything and you'll get this greyish broth. Doesn't taste as rich as it looks but neither is it as slurpy as ramen broth. I loved the Yaki Azuki Gyoza out of all and felt that it needn't be eaten as desserts towards the end of the meal. Sweet red bean mash encased in thin, crisp shell that reminded me of my all-time love, the Croissant Taiyaki. Never mind if there isn't any butter since they're probably healthier. Matcha, Sesame and Yuzu Ice Cream ($6 each) imported from Hokkaido are also wonderful sweet endings, though the red beans were undercooked. The biggest draw factor is the price. With the gyozas at an average $4.80 for 5 pieces and other food not exceeding $7, it's possibly one of the best deals for Japanese food in Orchard.",

    "text": "Gyoza-ya, under the care of Akashi Group has made the headline again among foodies since its opening in 2014. I tried to make myself available but every time I'm ready, something caught up. It's kinda sad when I am away from home most of the time with very brief period each time when I return from abroad. But I know I can't find excuse not to visit this time in Jan when I schedule my unplanned return to SG. I have been eating dumplings in Australia and they were mostly made by the mainland Chinese who flock the country of late. But I wasn't expecting the same at Gyoza-Ya, simply that I have read reviews from reputable accolades and I know they are one of my trusted source. I reached the humble outlet prior the dinner crowd: the time reads 6.15pm. There's ample tables to go around for 4s but 2s were almost taken up. The wait staff was polite and obliging to give me a table near the corner of the restaurant when I turned down his offer on the small table next to the entrance, neither a bar counter seat is welcoming, I told myself. I was given a small slip of order list that spells what the restaurant offers. Quite extensive given the size of the humble eating place. The service was very prompt and attentive. My Yuzu Cha arrived quickly and order was taken attentively. I was such a glutton that I ticked so many dishes that they seems to battle for table space when they arrived. \u00a0The soup udon was so flavorful that I can't bear to let them drained any unconsumed broth into the sink! The thick slab of char siew was equally good!! Tender and very well marinated, a good layer of lean plus fats goes so well. The JyaJya Men on the contrary didn't fare that well, perhaps the miso wasn't as robust. On average, the udon has a good chewy texture but still, I prefer the round udon to flat udon, the latter has a tougher bite. Gyoza-Ya serves only flat udon. Red king crab dumplings are a must eat. At $7.50, I got 5 plump gyoza filled with juicy minced crab meat, it's a premium dish in affordable price I must say. I like my dumplings boiled every time I had gyoza, even when I had them abroad. The pan fried pork dumplings were excellent too! Not greasy and there's a faint sweetness from the chopped cabbage mixed in the minced pork. The fried soft bone chicken chunks was crisp and addictive. I like the fried batter coating, it taste like the prized crunchy batter bits from long john silver fast food chain! Salty but a delightful way! It's a hate it or love it dish if u don't mind eating soft cartilage. What I least like was the tofu topped with minced beef, the seasoning in the beef just taste weird which I find no words in describing. I'm sorry. But the tofu has a silky texture. I'm glad to have made the trip tonight. Now, I can strike one restaurant out of my to-eat list that goes on and on whenever I leave my home base. Gyoza-Ya, indeed an inexpensive dumpling house that every foodies should at least try once. YUM!!",

OMG, Gyoza-ya, where have thou been all my life?The Yaki Buta Gyoza, aka the pan-fried pork Gyoza, is a MUST must must order. I already had high expectation from all the rave reviews on yelp, but I was not disappointed. The thinness of the gyoza skin, the perfect sear, the delicious minced pork that went so well with the vinegar sauce - just blew my mind. It's the absolute star of this restaurant. In fact, next time I wouldn't bother ordering anything else and just order multiple servings of this.It's 5 pieces per serving by the way. I think i can easy eat 20 of these by myself.However since I had to meet the $25 delivery order limit, I ordered other stuff too. Namely:Sui Buta Gyoza (boiled pork dumpling) - meh. Maybe bc it was delivered, i find that the thinness of the gyoza skin, which is what made the pan fried version so amazing, does not transfer over to the boiled version. Also not a fan of the sweet sauce that they douse all over it. I may have liked it more without the sauce.The garlic egg fried rice - this was much talked about on yelp so I gave it a try. And... I mean, it's good, but just like garlic fried rice in other japanese places.Broccoli aburi - meh. This was a weird deep fried(?) broccoli with bonito(?) flakes on top. Not really a fan.Ramen egg - i only needed another $2 to get to $25 so I threw this in. It was a good ramen egg, but it's what you should expect in other japanese places as well.",

    "text": "We began with two small seasonal appetisers (some thin rice noodle with goma [sweet sesame] sauce) and shredded teriyaki chicken. The noodles were smooth and delicate but slightly bland even with the goma sauce. I suppose the point was to appreciate the texture of the noodles. Meanwhile the teriyaki chicken was a little too sweet and sour, and didn't really taste like teriyaki at all. Indeed it was kind of like shredded jerky.Gyoza is what this place specialises in. The gyoza were bigger than at other places and the skin was smooth and not overly-thick like at some places. However the gyoza were not sealed so the meatballs inside fell out sometimes. Also the taste of the pork inside was a little odd. The gyoza sauce here seems to be a mix of, among other things, soy sauce, vinegar, oil and sugar. This compares to vinegar at many other places.We also had 2 types of noodles: jyajya men and tonkotsu udon. Jyajya men is like the Japanese version of Chinese zhajiang mian - noodles with a black meat sauce on top. Unfortunately these noodles were rather bland - more sauce was needed, and the sauce wasn't all that fragrant in the first place. It got even worse when, as recommended, I cracked in a soft boiled egg, added some sauce and hot water - it was even more bland. The tonkotsu udon was much better, being served in a rich meat broth.We also had seafood fried rice since the portions were quite small. It wasn't bad as far as Japanese fried rice goes (I think because they fry it on a grill instead of a wok it doesn't have much wok hei [smokiness of the wok] that Chinese fried rice has), but there was hardly any seafood inside. And yes, the portion was small to.The individual dishes are cheap but they add up to more than you'd expect! With two cups of green tea it added up to $40.60.",

    "text": "Practically the best gyoza outside Japan! I loved their boiled gyoza with prawn fillings. The fried tofu with minced beef is very nice as well. I did not order other things, because from what I heard, only the gyoza is worth ordering. If you are not a big eater like me, this place is just FERFECT! It's nice for in-between lunch and dinner timing, the environment pretty quiet on weekdays, it has spacious area with cute Japanese interior. Pricing is ultra reasonable! I will be back. :DHowever, only 1 thing got me turned off, they don't refill your green tea, I mean how difficult it is to do that?!!! And it's not like their green tea is free or tastes super good or something. I just thought it's a mandatory thing to provide free refill in a Japanese restaurant. Sigh.PS: THE GYOZA SAUCE IS BOMB and there is one on every table. Loving the free-flow ginger too! Is it just me or every dumpling tastes better with bunch of ginger, soy sauce, chilli oil and sesame oil! :p",

Shirasu Age is a whitebait fish lightly battered. Nikujyaga is a stewed vegetable and beef small plate. Both I recommend ordering on top of everything else. And I'm happy they've stuck to a limited menu offering so what they do, they do well.",

    "text": "The MOTHER of all Gyozas in Singapore is found in the basement of Robinsons Orchard. I know, i know... you're all thinking, how can you make a restaurant out of a side dish?!?!? Well.., if the skin is crisp and thin and the pork is tasty, then yes it can be done! I'm a simple man. I ordered three servings of the Pan-Fried Dumpling w/ Pork. Yes, you heard me! Three Servings! One for me, myself and I. Please note that the restaurant offers a version with Prawn or Vegetable, take your pick! To round up the meal I ordered two servings of Ninniku Yaki Meshi, more aptly known as Japanese GARLIC Fried Rice. As an avid rice lover, this rice dish just hit the spot, hence the needs for the extra serving.I'm sure some of you have been in the situation where the food was so good that any form of communication between you and your significant cease to exist. Well, it happened on my first and definitely not my last visit to Gyoza-Ya. :D",
