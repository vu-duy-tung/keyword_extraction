    "text": "Talking about quality Cze Char, there is always a queue outside Kok Sen Coffeeshop. They have been serving the usual Cze Char Dishes for about 50 years serving good dishes to family. They are one of those who have been listed under the Michelin Guide months ago.If you are tourist and going to Kok Sen, be prepared that this is not a upscale Chinese restaurant but a typical Singapore Coffee Shop place. In the event that the restaurant may be full, you might be asked to dine in the backlane, just beside a small road.If you have looked through the Menu, there were quite a number of noodles dishes with big prawns under the recommendation. However, we decided to go for plain bowls of rice at $0.70 per bowl to pair with our Cze Char Dishes.One of the recommended dishes will be the Claypot Yong Tau Foo. It tasted special to me with special gravy and stuffing in the Yong Tau Foo. Stuffing consist of meat and seafood which stands out from the mainstream ones from YTF Stall and these married well with the sweet addictive gravy.Claypot Yong Tau Foo \u5de7\u624b\u4e09\u5b9d\u7172 - $15 (Small)Sweet and Sour Pork was better than the average but not the best we had eaten. The general taste of sweet sourness was there and the meat of the pork was significant when we bite down the meat unlike some other places, we were short changed by replacing more fats that meat in the dish.Sweet & Sour Pork \u9178\u751c\u5495\u916a\u8089 - $13 (Small)When asked what to order, their staff recommended us to their Sambal Deep Fried Fish Tail. It was the expensive of all our dishes ordered but we had no regrets ordering this for its taste was outstanding and more than our expectations.Sambal Deep Fried Fish Tail \u53c1\u5df4\u6cb9\u9c7c\u5c3e - $53 (Market Price)The deep fried fish was fragrant. The spiciness neutralized with the sweetness of the fish tail and together with the thickness of the flesh, I would say the dish was very well executed. Besides Chilli, this Sambal dish was elevated with onions and even cut of pineapples.They accept reservation for at least 6 pax. Though it is an old school Coffeeshop place, I am quite impressed by their efficiency in serving food. Not only that, prices are friendly if compared to the quality of food.",

    "text": "After a year of walking by, crowd watching and drooling over what everyone is eating, we finally had the opportunity to try Kok Sen Restaurant, a local Tze Char restaurant that have had glowing recommendations, even recently receiving a Bib Gourmand recommendation in Singapore's Michelin guide. We were surprised at the queue considering we arrived around 5.45pm. Good thing was, the queue didn't take too long, about 10-15 mins but we were parked at the back ally of the restaurant, which was fine by us as it brought an even older feel to an already old restaurant. The menu is pretty extensive as well, with 98 dishes ranging from meats, eggs, vegetables and \u00a0seafood. Being our first time here, we had to go with their recommended / blog worthy dishes. Poached Chinese Spinach with Assorted Eggs ($11 or $14) Recommended as one of their must try dishes, the spinach didn't disappoint. Being one of my personal must haves at any Chinese restaurant, Kok Sen does it as perfect as is gets. The spinach was not overcooked, still bright green with a bit of a crunch, which the stock complimented the dish perfectly. Not too salty with the taste of the salted eggs gently infused in and the fried whole garlic adding a bit of a punch, it was really a very well balanced dish. Claypot Yong Tau Foo ($14, $21, or $28)Another well balanced and well conceived dish although I would recommend not ordering it if you were not a brinjal / eggplant fan. It comes with 3 varieties of Yong Tau Foo. Toufu, Capsicum and Eggplant, 3 pieces each. The tofu was nice and soft while the capsicum had a very good punch. But what made this dish special was the stuffing. Unlike regular Yong Tau Foo that uses purely fish paste for the filling, the ones here had a nice blend of fish and prawns, giving it an elevated sweetness that complimented the mildly salty yet very fragrant sauce. A must have with rice. Bittergourd Braised Pork Ribs Black Bean Sauce ($14, $21, $28)The bittergourd was in this dish was braised beautifully with the black bean sauce. It was soft yet juicy with a slight bitterness that complimented the black bean sauce wonderfully well. The pork ribs were very good too, juicy and tender. The only draw back is that they chopped the ribs to very small pieces which was a little disappointing. That and there were bits of bone shards you had to be careful of. Prawn Paste Chicken ($12, $24) One of the best Prawn Paste Chicken (Har Jiong Gai) I've ever had. The prawn past was fragrant without being overpowering. The chicken was juicy and tender and it wasn't overly oily. Key note: it was nearly a whole chicken chopped so you don't get beautiful whole chicken wings but bits and pieces with the bones still attached, which I did like because the bones always have a lot of flavour. Might not appeal to all because not everyone enjoys going through bones the way I do. Overall, I really liked the dishes here. They weren't overly salty and had no or minimal MSG (I am quite sensitive to msg so the fact my body didn't ache after the meal showed that they barely used it if any at all). Despite being a very busy and popular restaurant, there's still something very home cooked about their food which was very nice. We'll definitely be back to try some of their other recommended dishes, like the claypot prawn horfun which was highly recommended as well.",

And thank god I did because I tasted the yummiest noodles ever for the first time today.I wouldn't be able to describe their signature big prawn rice noodles as well as it tasted - a brown sauce, kinda spicy and meaty. The noodles were flat and wide silky stuff. The shrimp was fresh and juicy. Think of a horfun x1000000 of wow factor. The shrimp paste chicken was delish. Small bites. Could be one of the better ones in Singapore. It ain't got anything on Ice Cold Beer's but was still noteworthy. Fried eggs were just alright and nothing to rave about. Would order the butter calamari the next time here. Man, I can't wait for dinner tomorrow. It will be here.",

I ordered the big prawn hor fun and Big prawn mee soup. Tasted similar with a minimum size and cost of $14-$15 per plate or bowl.All I remember was that it was a LOT of prawns. Was even feeling a bit \"jelak\" after eating so many!If you had to choose one of those, go for the hor fun. It's not bad but quite expensive. The service here was little rude but it's quite the norm with old coffeeshop workers or owners in this industry in our tiny island city. Get used to it! Hahah..Would I recommend it? Well... if you haven't been before and happen to be around the area... sure why not? If you have to travel quite the distance (more than 20mins) just give it a MISS! You won't be kicking yourself and still be able to go home and sleep well....I ASSURE YOU. ;)3.0 STARS",

To start off, they tried to squeeze 13 people around a small table. And succeeded, but it was very uncomfortable, and \"13\" is clearly an inauspicious number.",

Dai Har is the holy grail of Kok Sen, it is what causes the sun to rise from the east; it causes the first flower to bloom in spring; it is why the machu pichu has so many steps. I promise you a mind blowing experience. So remember, Dai Har in its numerous variation (Hor Fun -my personal favorite, Vermicelli soup, Ginger and Leek stir fry etc.) is all you need. Oh yeah, the claypot yong tau fu is smashing too. Don't forget to get that ;)",

The black bean gravy is such a flavour explosion, coating the noodles to perfection.If you think I'm singing too much of a love song, you got to come by and try it out for yourself.Of course they have loads of other things for you to eat, but first things first... get the beef hor fun.",

    "text": "The first time I went to Kok Sen was entirely by luck and was the first week I arrived in Singapore. \u00a0We just had a few rounds of drinks at Vida Vino across the street and was craving some real hot food. \u00a0Then we saw Kok Sen on the opposite side of Keong Saik Road. \u00a0The food was typical cz char fare but they were all well executed, esp. the stir-fried. \u00a0 I went back last week. \u00a0It was a Wednesday night but the place was packed with people. However, turnover was quite fast so we got a table after 10 mins. \u00a0I have to say the quality was pretty consistent and the stir-fried dishes are really good. I agree with one of the prior reviews, that the dishes have good \"wok-hei\" which I don't really know how to translate exactly but it means capturing the good \"chi\" from the wok. \u00a0To have good \"wok-hei\", you need superb stir-frying skills with good control of temperature and intensity of the stove fire. \u00a0We had the big prawn bee-hoon, the soup was so full of prawn flavor it's like a prawn juice, I guess umami is the word for this. \u00a0We also had the pork steamed with preserved prawn paste. This can be a bit salty on its own, but the way we Cantos eat it is to down each little piece of pork with plain rice. \u00a0However, I must warn you that preserved prawn paste is not for everyone given its very strong aroma (kind of like salted fish) but if you like it it's paradise. \u00a0Their harcheung chicken is also very well done - crispy and flavorful. Again the stir-fried veggies were well executed, another evidence of the superb stir-fry skill of the chef. \u00a0The place is not fancy at all but serves good old home-cooked meals, which is an increasingly rare find on keong saik road.",
