Definitely a must visit for anyone craving good authentic Italian. P.S. Tuesday's ladies night and you can a free glass of proseco with your main!",

I was wowed by the squid ink fettuccini, excited by the grilled octopus tentacle, bored by the beef ravioli and utterly disappointed by the bread sticks. (For the record, the breadsticks were crusty, hard and far too dry)Service is exceptionally attentive and professional, and possibly one of the best experiences I've had dining in Singapore. It's the kind of place you can bring someone on a first date. (And leave crying when you are handed the check)My wallet is now begging me for mercy. Kinda explains the Ferrari parked outside (which I'm told, belong to the owner of the restaurant).",

We were a group of nine. \u00a0They began by bringing us an appetizer we had not ordered. \u00a0When I mentioned that we did not order this item, the response was since no one else had ordered one they could not take it back and we had to take it. \u00a0Really? \u00a0 We still ordered the item we wanted.But it gets better.......We were directed to the wine seller where we picked a 2005 Barolo for SGD $250. \u00a0The waiter dumped it into a decanter as if emptying out a jug of water. \u00a0No sediments in a 10 year old wine I thought to myself? \u00a0 The color was faint, like a bad Pinot, or a cheap Beaujolais. \u00a0 The taste was worse, bitter and oxidized. \u00a0As we had guests and judging by how they treated their mistake about the appetizer, I kept hush. \u00a0 \u00a0Weather they knowingly buy fake label wines or buy at deep discounts from a dishonest distributor, and look the other way, I can't be sure. \u00a0 \u00a0In fact, in a recent trip to Italy after my last visit to Valentino I had the same bottle, and long before taste, just by color you could tell Valentino's was fake. \u00a0A see through 11 year old Barolo...it will fool only those one who have leaned about wine by attending those weekend courses in Singapore. The food is good, but the offensive treatment and phony wines has me saying good bye after years of patronage which goes back to their prior location.",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner date at Ristorante da Valentino.This was a very pleasant dining experience. \u00a0The entire experience (service, ambiance, menu) represent classic Italian dining.From the moment you are greeted, the staff is pleasant, professional, and informative. \u00a0Out of my entire experience at Valentino, the service is what stands out the most.Our \"Captain\" was obviously an experienced professional server. \u00a0He was consistently there. \u00a0He was very engaging. \u00a0He was very informative with the menu and what to expect. \u00a0I love the table side portioning of the appetizers. \u00a0It just adds a touch of sophistication and personalization to the experience.The ambiance is relatively classic fine dining. \u00a0It is large open space. \u00a0There are sporadic tchotchkes that add touches of charm along the way.The food ranged from flawed to excellent. \u00a0The starters were fantastic. \u00a0The squid pasta dish was amazing. \u00a0For some reason, each of our mains were disappointing. \u00a0My dinner date was very dissatisfied with her main.Ciabatta Bread - This was very good. \u00a0It was warm with a mild flavour and there was a very nice dipping oil for it. \u00a0(I am going to note here. \u00a0This was presented as complimentary bread but it is not. \u00a0They charge $6.50 for it. \u00a0I expect this in lesser restaurants in Singapore. \u00a0I do not expect it in a dining experience that is going to run over the $500 mark. \u00a0They simply do not need to stoop to this level.) \u00a0tinyurl.com/m6kuebpBurrata with tomatoes - This was simply a plate of heaven. \u00a0The creamy warm burrata. \u00a0The tomatoes had a light sweetness. \u00a0The small bit of ham for additional saltiness. \u00a0Even the greens worked to add some additional texture and a peppery bite. The dish was brought to the table as a complete dish. \u00a0Our \"captain\" then cut and portioned the dish.tinyurl.com/lw6gmyuGrilled Octopus Tentacle - This was so very good. The octopus was tender. \u00a0There was a soft smokiness from the searing. \u00a0It was just delicious.This dish was also brought to the table whole and then portioned table-side.tinyurl.com/md55gcnSquid Ink Fettuccini with crab meat - This was our selection for a pasta course. \u00a0This was rich and creamy goodness. \u00a0I think I finished my portion in two minutes. \u00a0I have never wielded a pasta spoon with such speed and grace. \u00a0The crab was buttery. \u00a0The pasta was perfectly prepared. The sauce was silky. \u00a0The squid ink was perfectly restrained.tinyurl.com/lf3v7jwManzo Gorgonzola (steak with bleu cheese) - This was my main course. \u00a0This was a basic and neatly presented dish. \u00a0Unfortunately, I did not like it very much. \u00a0It came down to the beef. \u00a0I simply did not enjoy the flavour of the meat. \u00a0It was cooked to a perfect medium rare. \u00a0I just didn't enjoy the way it tasted. \u00a0I also thought the bleu cheese would play a stronger role in the flavour \u00a0profile. \u00a0The sides were basic and lacked imagination.tinyurl.com/m9ypje6Sirloin with foie gras - My dinner companion selected this item from the evening's specials. \u00a0She did not enjoy it. Primarily, she stated the rosemary was dominating the entire flavour of the dish. \u00a0This is an easy mistake to make when using fresh rosemary. \u00a0She did not eat very much of her main course.I do not have a photo of this dish.Lemon Sorbet - This was her dessert. \u00a0It was elegantly presented using the frozen rind of a lemon. \u00a0She seemed to enjoy it. \u00a0I did not try it. \u00a0tinyurl.com/mofovkoSalame Cioccolat - This was a chocolate cookie dish with ice cream. \u00a0I found it to be an average chocolate dish. \u00a0 It's chocolate. \u00a0So, it was good. \u00a0But, it was not anything special. \u00a0I also found the hardness of the cookies made it a little challenging to eat.tinyurl.com/mrwj9snReceipt (Dinner for two): $530.00tinyurl.com/lh3256aOverall - I do think this was a very enjoyable experience. \u00a0I can't say enough great things about the service. \u00a0The ambiance is classic fine dining. \u00a0The menu is diverse. \u00a0It all fits so well together. \u00a0The food had some extreme high points (starters through \u00a0pasta course). \u00a0However, the main courses fell a little short and this is the reason I am only providing a four star review. \u00a0I would not hesitate to return. I also think it an excellent option for a special dinner.",

Still impressed by their aged beef served on a wooden board (didn't get the dish name). Lightly seasoned, moist and so tender. Mouth watering delicious. Go for the lightly charred parts and I reckon you will remember the taste for a long time. Desserts: they don't do trolley service anymore what a shame. Don't let that stop you from going up to the display to see what's available. The panna cotta is an absolute must try. Flawless service. Attentive and personable. What can I say- I love this place!",

We got the private room, everything was pre-ordered, and there was plenty of food to go around.First off, the service was excellent. We had a person assigned to our room, he was friendly, helpful, and was always able to get us whatever we needed (plates, condiments, etc.). He was also very friendly, and in fact the entire team was. It was a very warm, personable dining experience, and I cannot fault the service at all. Food wise, the antipasti was good... borderline great. We had some grilled vegetables, marinated mushrooms, ham, the usual basically and it was all of good quality. I just wasn't blown away because that's really the minimum you expect now of a respectable Italian restaurant. I actually found the pastas very mediocre. We had a vegetarian Aglio Olio and a ricotta and spinach cannellon. Neither were spectacular, both were just good. The mains of fish and pork were also unspectacular. Good but so uneventful that I just remember being satisfied, but unimpressed. Maybe they just didn't suit my palate, maybe we just ordered the wrong things.I'd would come back even if I only rated it 3 stars because maybe I just didn't order the right items. At least, that MUST be the case if everyone else rates them so highly.",

Its original Jalan Bingka/Rifle Range location was perfect, because it was so hidden away. It still maintains the sense of hiddenaway-ness, even with larger space at Turf Club Road.Diners who have been going to Valentino for a long time will fondly remember the living room and how it was such an integral part of the entire Valentino experience. This restaurant was never atas or fancy -- it was warm, homely, and made you happy with the great food from the great family that made it. Chef Valentino cooks with his mother Alma. It's beautiful.The food is still good, still very authentic, and sometimes it seems like various family members will just spring up and go to cook you something... and that's good! \"Try my mama's lemon tart!\" When someone enthusiastically wants you to try his mother's desserts, you must.I have been eating here for a long time and.. I love everything. Especially the squid ink pasta. I love all the risottos, and all the mains, and all the appetizers... I love everything here. Most of all I love the warmth of this family and the amazing place they've built together. Truly a gem of the west.",

And this is while they don't have to do that because they already made their money, visible from the ferrari's outside. The food is amazing, fresh and intense. Italian cuisine at it's best. Simple dishes with high quality ingredients prepared perfectly. My favorite is the mozzarella and the truffel pasta's. Their desserts are made by Perla, who also has a store at the Taka basement.",

    "text": "This place serves the most delicious italian food I can find in Singapore. Very authentic, very home-style. The decor is beautiful, very old-school Italian with a touch of modern art. They have a nice patio and herb garden that they are still working on, but the interior of the place is already sufficient to leave an impression, with an eclectic display of various vintage appliances, photographs of various parts of Italy, and salmon colored tablecloths (which I never thought could work...anywhere.). If you plan on coming here, please plan on paying around 100 per pax. The mains are around 20-50 dollars, but you have to pay for bread ($5.50) and my mixed berries cheesecake was 16 bucks. A glass of pinot grigio was 20 bucks, go figure. I guess I'm used to homestyle italian restaurants back in southern california where they offer free bread and offer a free dessert on your birthday....Anywho, the food was delectable. We had the burrata with cherry tomatoes and greens, and the burrata was very milky and fresh and was a delight to eat. The tomatoes were from Sicily and very ripe and sweet. We had the fried anchovies too, which is a Roman specialty, and it was comparable to that served in Roma. My squid ink fettucine with crabmeat in a creamy tomato sauce was a tad too creamy for me, although the flavor was very good and the crabmeat was very sweet. I really enjoyed the gnocchi in gorganzola sauce. The gnocchi was like soft pillows of pleasure and definitely home made. I would come back just for the gnocchi. My mixed berry cheesecake was very light, fluffy and just the right amount of sweetness. One of the better desserts I've had in a while. In general, a good place to splurge at for a special occasion.",

    "text": "Very poor. My friend is a regular here so we came here to celebrate a friend's 26th birthday. The food was all well and fine, but here's the kicker:I had brought an expensive custom-decorated cake for my friend's birthday. There was a mix-up and the waitstaff served it to another party that was celebrating a birthday. In the first place, I do not know how such a mix-up could occur, since my friend's name was clearly spelt out on the cake. The chef apologized, the manager apologized, we were given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and our cake was replaced with a cake of their own, which we personally thought was mediocre in comparison to the cake I had brought. They also placed 38 candles on the cake, without even asking us how old she was. We barely touched the cake. Only after we made it known to them the trouble and cost of our cake did they decide to give us a discount on our bill. Fine, these things happen I suppose. This is where it gets worse. I had decided to ask the staff if there was any portion left of the cake I had brought, since I thought it only right that the birthday girl at least get a taste of the cake I had taken the trouble to order for her. They told us that no, nothing was left. Later on, we saw the party they had served our cake to leave with a cake box. The cake box was also in a different plastic bag than the one I had brought it in (I had gotten it straight from a hotel, and had carried it in a bag from that hotel). Clearly there was a portion of the cake left. It also appeared to me that Valentino had deliberately covered up their mistake to the other patrons and taken credit for a cake that was not their own. A cake that the other party claimed was 'very good', I was told by their manager. Their mistake was forgivable, but the insincerity and dishonesty not so much. Terribly disappointing, since our otherwise pleasant evening had been marred by this incident. My friends and I will not be returning to this establishment.",
