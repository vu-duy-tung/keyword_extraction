    "text": "Solid coffee joint, with a staff that cares about coffee and cares enough to explain and help you make good choices. Their drip is excellent, done slowly and with care. As others have mentioned, it's a welcome respite from the nearby Orchard Towers crowd, and a nice alternative to the coffee beans and terrible Starbucks coffee. Americans be warned - no filtered coffee available.",

May not attract many customers from Orchard Towers next door; those may prefer mee sua in the basement or greasy quesadillas with mojitos at Se\u00f1or Taco anyway.",

There's free wi-fi with facebook check-in or filling out a form (pretty straightforward once you connect). Too bad the outlets were few and far between though. The internet speed was pretty decent although it started out a bit slow. The A/C was wayyy too cold though, so unfortunately I had to bounce after about 2 hrs. My hairs were standing on end!",

Gibraltar hits just the right spot. They don't offer decaf like many other proper cafes, most frustratingly. Eggs and toast at $6, with butter and jam, is an affordable option compared to $16 similar breakfasts down Orchard Road. Bonus points to Jewel for offering vegemite if you prefer it.",

Smooth yet strong, I savoured every single drop of it. It went well with the pastry although the latter was just a tad too sweet.",
