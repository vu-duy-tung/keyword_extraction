    "text": "In one sentence, the food and service is stellar and that's all you need to know. However, this is a review so I'll write a bit more. From the moment we were seated on a lazy afternoon to the time we were handed the cheque, we could not possibly have had any chance to regret our decision. Service was remarkable. The owner, I presume, was friendly and welcoming. He joked at my occasional faux pas and was very patient with our numerous queries. The light hearted atmosphere made it very pleasant indeed, and it was clear why there'd be so many patrons sitting around and chatting after they had long finished their lunch. It's an Anglo Indian restaurant so there's a portion of the food that just fusion. We opted not to go for the fusion pasta and had the boring dishes you'd see everywhere in England - saag paneer and chicken tikka masala. Unfortunately, he'd mistaken our order and it wasn't saag paneer. I'm not sure what it was but the paneer is good, not the usual rubbery cube but a soft, tender cheese in a richly spiced and slightly creamy curry. The chicken tikka masala was also cooked to perfection, not overcooked at all. Even my British partner who grew up in a mostly Indian-populated part of UK had to concede that they were so very good. The mango lassi was just the right thickness, sweetness and acidity with a strong hint of mango. Our entire meal came up to 60 plus. Each main is from 14 to 22 dollars and naans are generally $4 to $4.50. There are set lunches with curries of the day, but we didn't try them. If you like North Indian curries or, more accurately, British style curries, this place is a must try. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "This place is slightly different from the other Indian restaurants in Singapore, in that it has a few dishes you might find in the UK (as the name suggests, though not as many as I'd like). It's slightly pricey, but the servings are larger than usual and the quality is good.I tried the Anglo Indian Country Captain Chicken, which had nice semi-crunchy onion bits inside. It had a very generous portion of chicken, and used above average sized and above average cuts (though not chicken breast, as you'd likely find in the UK - which was a good thing since that'd be too dry). While delicious, I'd been told it was of medium spiciness, but I found it very spicy.The kulcha (an Indian bread you don't find in most places) was fresh, hot, crispy and glittering with butter. It had a great onion flavour too, containing finely minced and not too raw onion (there was also a potato option).The mango lassi was not very sweet, had a relatively mild mango taste and had more ice than I'd have liked, but it was only $7 and still better than at some places, so.Unfortunately the rasmalai (Indian cheese cake) was disappointing. It had a bit of a chalky taste and aftertaste and was like minced paneer compressed together (yes, I know it's made of paneer but at other places where I've had this it was more like cake, creamier and richer).",

    "text": "Got the butter chicken, palak paneer and mutton biryani. Butter chicken and palak paneer was great--both were very creamy and smooth. I wasn't a huge fan of the biryani because I could see and taste raw ginger in the rice, but the presentation (having a naan baked on top of it) was quite impressive. There was not a ton of meat in the mutton biryani too...We got roti, naan and butter naan. The butter naan and roti were my favorite! For the cost (things were between $19 and $22), the food portion were not very big, but it was definitely enough for one if you ordered more breads. The curries did not come with rice or bread. Maybe a lunch special would have been more worth it...",

    "text": "I am a big fan of the original Anglo Indian caf\u00e9 in the CBD. So, the experience at the Chijmes outlet came as a shock! It's like it has completely different ownership and management. The menu is much shorter, the service is taciturn (vs. warm and welcoming at the downtown location). Most importantly, the food is not good. The CBD outlet's biryani is one of the best in town - with fragrant steam coming out when you cut open the pastry cover; here, it's just warm. The prawn curry is too salty. Even the papadum is soggy! Unacceptable at $42 per head. But, definitely DO GO to the Shenton Way location - it's very good and good value too!",

I would've done takeout and nommed in PJs in my room at the Westin but wasn't too keen on having my room smell like Indian food, so I grabbed a table outside at this cute restaurant. A large G&T seemed in order in the 90 degree 100% humidity weather, so I enjoyed that with some naan and chicken tikka masala. It was quick, delicious and reasonably priced, and there was good people watching in and out of the Exchange bar a few doors down.",

Biryani is a must have with the wrapping of roti. Service is good, but not excellent. The variety even extends to beverages, and one can have a heartful time here.Would recommend to friends for fine non-veg dishes and a delicious biryani.",

    "text": "Basics: Set at the end of a row of restaurants and cafe is Anglo Indian Cafe and Bar. They have both indoor and outdoor seating and thankfully, to someone who's not used to this humidity, they have portable air-con units outside so you can enjoy your meal without passing out from the heat. They have both high and low top seating and since the tables are detached you can join them together for a bigger group. They have a fairly decent sized TV screen that faces the outdoor seating area that's locked to a sports station, at least every time I passed by at night I can see the English Premier League or cricket. \u00a0Food: Okay, so I'm probably a newbie compared to everyone in Singapore when it comes to Indian food, but honestly this has to be one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Singapore. Basically, they do upscale Indian cuisine similar to Punjab Grill at MBS, but without the creativity, just good old fashion cooking. I've been here several times for dinner, so far never for lunch, and I haven't been disappointed. I highly recommend the Mutton Biryani. I personally don't like lamb, but the way they cook it really blends the flavours well and doesn't leave a strong taste or smell. I thought the Paneer Butter Masala was done well and the curry in Butter Chicken was fantastic. As for drinks, I haven't tried any of the cocktails, but a great place to grab a Paulaner and watch some sports highlights after work. Granted if you're looking for more of a party, the Exchange and Bank is more lively...more to come on that in my other reviews. Dunno if it's just me, but I usually order quite a few dishes since I just can't bring myself to just having biryani and chicken, plus if you add a drink or two, the bill adds up pretty quickly. I know since they're located in the CBD they have to charge a premium, but unless I'm eating with a bigger group, it's a little hard to comprehend paying so much for dinner. Then again, it is a fantastic meal. To each his own when it comes to value for money, but this place always hits the spot for me.",
