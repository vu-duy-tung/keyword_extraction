    "text": "It was quite a hot day and I was feeling for something cold and not too heavy. The place was relatively quiet at 2.30pm on weekday, with just a couple of customers. The place was known for its poke bowls, but I decided to go for its Superfood Smoothie Bowls which had 4 selections at $6 each.Maca Nutter Base - Banana, raw maca, soy milk. Toppings - Coconut & dark chocolate drizzle, pomegranate, dark chocolate shavings, roasted cashews.It was quite refreshing and smooth, except for the frozen pieces of banana in the base. I like the feel of the burst of pomegranate in the mouth.",

I know poke is still new in Singapore and I have to say they did a really good job of making my order. After you pick your base you can get the same ingredients that you see in an American poke joint. If you are a hardcore addict of poke you can add the premium ingredients for an extra cost. Here they have drinks and won't overcharge you no matter what you get. I love the smoothie they have. Tastes real authentic and is perfect for lunch.It's a place where many millennial can have a work or school break. The staff here is real happy and really care for the customer. Getting a to go is good as well because you can pair it with some Milo. The price is good if you are an US tourist. Come here whether you are a poke fan or not",

    "text": "There was a groupon deal and hence one of my church mate suggested that we come here to celebrate our birthdays.Stepped in around 1.30pm on a Saturday. The dining area were half filled with customers and hence we were able to choose to sit on a high chair or normal seating arrangements. Personally, I have not had poke bowls ever since I stepped out of California. Hence this make-your-own bowl concept was intriguing especially with the vast varieties of items that you could add onto your bowl. For the base, I ordered Signature Sushi Rice. For the flavor, I ordered Spicy Mayo Salmon and Spicy Garlic Sesame Tuna (additional cost). For the toppings, Pineapple, Edamame, Nori Flakes, Lime Avocado and Spiced Roasted cashews (some of them are with additional costs).Decided to sit on one of the high tables. On the side, there was a serving table with \"dressings\" that you could add onto the poke bowl. The colors of my bowl looked vibrant and it definitely made me to dig in straightaway.The combination was perfect. I love each and every ingredients I chose. Each of them have distinct tastes which combined the dish well - crunchy, sweet, sour, spicy.. The must tries are the roasted cashews, tuna and salmon. This place's interior design made the surroundings to be homey. Service was fast but a little pricey. But overall, I enjoyed my meal and will be back again in the near future.",

When you're there, don't be shy! Talk to the staff and let them know how you love their food.",

    "text": "Something about this place throws me off. Maybe it's the lighting. Or it could be they add too much stuff to the poke bowls. It a bit of both. Poke is meant to be extremely simple. That's how the Hawaiians do it. Fish. Soy. Onions. Garlic. And maybe one or two items of flair. I think the \"poke wars\" of 2016 have made diversifying a priority for competitive differentiation between poke shops. Too bad poke is a commodity and should stay that way. Complexity dilutes taste. But if you don't care about taste and would rather queue up to spend money on a glorified bouquet. Go ahead. Purists like me will make poke at home. DM me if you want my poke recipe.",

    "text": "Had a large bowl of sushi rice with Original Shoyu Tuna and spicy Mayo salmon. Added pomegranate, avocado, kale chips, edamameThe fish and rice were tasty and liked how they infused lime into the avocado. However thought the rice was too little in comparison to the amount of toppings you have. Liked how you could mix and match and the serving system was efficient to make even the line during the lunch crowd move pretty quickly. Thought that it was slightly too expensive though, I could go to a Japanese restaurant and pay the same or less for tastier dons",

The avocado mayo salmon was fantastic. If you don't like raw fish, the smoothie bowls are worth the trip in themselves--the maca nutter was earthy and delicious, though I can't vouch for the absence of any added sugar.",
