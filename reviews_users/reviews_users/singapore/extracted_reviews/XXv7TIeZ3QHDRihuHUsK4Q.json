I would definitely recommend the octopus, seafood basket and the scallop ciopino. \u00a0I'm not entirely sure what is up with the negative reviews. Prices are equal or lower of other similar seafood restaurants in the area and the quality is generally better. I like the location as it's a quiet residential area rather than a busy commercial area like orchard. If you're in the Bukit Timah area definitely check it out.",

We had to wait more than 15 min for the host to even pay us attention and then no one took our order until we complained to the chef. We finally got our second dish... one hour later. Food tastes good, but I don't think that the wait is worth it. Suggestions are to buy the seafood to go or eat at another restaurant that has both good seafood and good service.",

    "text": "The food was a hit-and-miss: oysters are a must-try, fish catches cooked in the style of grilling or pan-searing are a fail-safe, pastas are a hard pass, and squid, done any way, is a cannot miss.1) For oysters, Canadian Golden Mantle ($4) are best for people who love big bold flavours; whereas the Canadian Mary Point ($4) is for people with a sweet tooth, the Irish one ($4) will be preferred by people who like things delicate (this was my favourite), and the French Gillardeau ($8) is for people who think only good thigns come in big packages, which probably explains its double pricetag.2) Hot Seafood Platter ($99): a massive medley of half a Boston lobster, grilled prawns, fish skewers, NZ mussels with garlic, littleneck clams in white wine, char-grilled Mediterranean squid, oysters mornay with caramelised onions, grilled octopus in spicy vinaigrette mesclun, and fries. It looked a rustic mess, but was deliciously value-for-money. Standouts include the squid and octopus, both were executed flawlessly.3) Squid Ink Linguine ($21.95) - slicked with the moreish essence of squid ink: I liked that it was generously dotted with perfectly cooked calamari.4) Scallop Cioppino ($23.95): an unusual but wonderful combination of spinach pesto-ed spaghetti and spicy arrabiatta, but let down by overcooked rubbery scallops.5) White Truffle Linguine ($23.95) - white truffle tapenade swirled into parmesan cream, and flecked with shitake aplenty: waaaay too rich, this got cloying about halfway through.6) Char-Grilled Atlantic Halibut ($32.95): delicate and beautifully burnished, drizzled with a velvety herbed butter, and sided by grilled asparagus, broccoli and marinated cherry tomatoes. Fantastic stuff, even if I found a number of bones embedded within. 7) Pan-Seared Atlantic Cod ($29.95): perfectly flaky and luscious, and served with grilled zucchini, eggplant, broccoli, herbed cherry tomatoes, atop a bed of fluffy mash",

Hubby found Quayside Isle on a map and the name of a restaurant he'd read good reviews about. So we hopped in a cab to the W and then walked past all the restaurants to see what looked best. Decided on this one because we were in the mood for fresh seafood. We sat outside with a lovely view of the harbor and shared delicious appetizers, entrees, and wine. Service started off great and then dwindled throughout the night as the place got more crowded. But overall it was a good meal.",

Being fish lovers, my mum would lovingly search for fresh fish at the market. But when we want 'ang moh' fishes, it may not be so easy to find it at local wet markets. Greenwood has a good variety and they advised my mother which fishes are suitable for grill for our barbeque once and after chatting, my mother ordered the next batch of fresh wild salmon from them. She grumbles that the farm bred ones have a taste and smell about them that loses the 'fishiness' that she likes about the oily fish. We also bought scallops which were fresh and they had quite good seasonal offerings.However, their prices are rather steep and unless it's for an occasion, it might be rather hefty to do groceries here on a daily/ weekly basis.",

I love the calamari here and it is one of my favorites in Singapore. The squid is very fresh and the batter is light and crisp. All that deep fried goodness is pretty indescribable. The fish was really fresh too but I found the batter a little too thick for my liking. They give a generous portion of fries which is always good for making the meal a satisfying one. Can't do without the carbs.Overall, they do one of the better fish and chips in town, but eating in is not really an option.",

The manager that evening (Kailash, I believe) \u00a0was a disaster hire....gave one excuse after another instead of an apology. Finally, I demanded a refund as he knew he was in trouble with me and quite a few other customers waiting for their take out.A few more of such evenings like tonite, Fish Market in greenwood will soon be another bygone restaurant at the Greenwood Avenue cluster of eateries.",

It's situated in the cluster of restaurants at Hillcrest Ave. Free valet which is convenient since finding parking there can be a headache.All of us just got fish and chips (though we also got salmon sashimi to start). I had the house fish and chips (battered) while the other 2 had the one the waiter recommended as the freshest that day (I forget the name). And really it was enjoyable but not great. And at $20+ for the basic and $30+ for the catch of the day, it just doesn't really seem worth it for 2 small pieces of fish.Was happy to try it once but I doubt I'd return (unless it's for this $1 oyster night other reviewers have mentioned)",

I had thought the whole point of having a restaurant arm for a fish market was to sell fresh seafood dishes, not dump whatever stale seafood they couldn't sell in the market to restaurant customers. The oysters were not fresh, we returned so many that we gave up on returning them in the end. This included oysters that were $7 a piece. Food was poorly seasoned and rubbery. We had the seafood platter to try a little bit of everything. Lobster, shrimp, clams, grilled oysters, octopus and squid just did not taste good. The platter was supposed to come with fish skewers and they switched it out for fish and chips without mentioning it at all. The kitchen was not well ventilated; everyone smelled like fried fish after the meal. Service was poor, we had to ask for tar tar sauce for fish and chips.",

The chili sauce is just too good to resist, and when paired with mayonaisse, this is certainly one of the best takeout fish'n'chips take out places in Singapore. Many living around the area can attest to that as it has become a favourite haunt for people who want to takeaway a scrumptious yet hassle-free meal.I have heard good things about their Bistro though, being housed in the picturesque Greenwood neighbourhood. However, I heard the prices were steep, and definitely not as worthwhile as taking away fish'n'chips. Good news for those with cars as complimentary valet service is provided for customers in this 'hard to find parking' area.",

The manager who served us Kailash insisted that I have to order each variant in pairs. No where on the menu stated this and during my last visit a week ago there was no such rule. Nowhere on the menu stated this and he rudely insisted that the rules have changed. They advertised 18 varieties and that was the draw of the festival! How unreasonable to insist that I have to order two each! So I asked to check with the owner and no one came back to explain! \u00a0I totally do not see the rationale in this rule as oysters come individual, not pairs and because of this bad experience I am never coming back again.",

They are doing so well now that they have opened another bistro along the same street however my memories are with the old bistro which was more like a fish market with a restaurant in the back. The old bistro has a nautical theme with dim lighting against walls with posters of various fish and crustaceans. I guess with all the surrounding it does put you into a seafood mood. An appetizer that never disappoints is the pan seared Salmon Belly and Scallops. Well garnished and cooked to perfection, this appetizer is bound to please any crowd. For mains, you're spoilt for choice but I do personally recommend the Cod. Do check with your server for best method of cooking and for information on the catch of the day as well. I almost forgot the most exciting part, it is OYSTER NIGHT every Tuesday, a $1 an oyster(raw, freshly shucked).. But be warned, it's a crowded event so make your bookings early and go oyster crazy!",
