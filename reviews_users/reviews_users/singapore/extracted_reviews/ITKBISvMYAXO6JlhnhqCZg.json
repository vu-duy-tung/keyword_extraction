The rice tasted great and was cooked with their stock. Their chicken rice is 5-stars. The side barbecue pork was a little hard and dry. The ambience is casual. This place is great for quick meals. Highly recommended.",

Charge for 1 person chicken rice cost $6.80....not worth the price, cos I can get exactly the same potion and taste from most of the chicken rice stall in Singapore at a cheaper price.The chili here is very spicy, too spicy to kill the taste of the chicken rice.Don't think I'll be back here, unless nearby and craving for chicken rice.Oh yes, the chicken rice I ordered does not comes with soup.....you have buy!!!This place air conditioning need to change, I was perspiring when I was eating inside....no tissue here too",

    "text": "Had takeaway lunch here and ordered a chicken drum stick rice, a small portion of xiao bai cai (vege), and a barley water (home made). Total damage = $14.90, which I think is overpriced for... Chicken rice. $7.50 for the chicken drumstick rice and $5.50 for the vege. They are good, but maybe my taste sense lacks the sophistication to differentiate between good chicken rice and very good chicken rice.. They all taste pretty similar to me and a $3-4 chicken rice is all I need. Watch out for the chili sauce - it's really spicy!",

Not salty, not fragrant..only spicy..Caught a staff cleaning the inside of the food display glass during dinner time. Not so sure about have newspapers wiping just above the food. Not too hygienic in my opinion.Overpriced for the quality that they serve..",

Wish the price could go down a bit. But the taste is confirm very shiok. Plus I love the spicy chilly sauce here. It is REAL! :)",

    "text": "This was probably a place that had its popularity boom in the 90s and in the early noughties but has since experienced a dip in business because it didn't manage to keep up with the times, decided to overcharge ($5 for a measly plate of chicken rice?!), struggling to survive (shrugs). Just happened to be around Balmoral Plaza with a friend and we had the chicken rice (we always went to Novena to do Wee Nam Kee but we'd been doing that for the past 4-5 chicken rice expeditions so we wanted a change, but lesson learned - ALWAYS stick to WNK), it was insufficient and we even 'upsized', but were still disappointed. Chicken was bony, chilli was pretty good, ginger was too watery, and drinks were bordering on $1.50 as well. I guess the ACS boys (and peeps from other international schools and the high-heeled people in this neighborhood) nearby can afford this and find it alright, but I will always agree with the fact that Chicken Rice should be capped at $3 (I'm frowning at you, Chatterbox), and if it should cost more than $3, I would expect it to be lip-smackingly delicious or be a gargantuan serving... otherwise...",

But I have to say, the chicken rice is so good, the soups are excellent, the seafood omelette is very good (not as good as malaysian hochien, but good enough). Officially our fave chic rice restaurant after 5 star.",
