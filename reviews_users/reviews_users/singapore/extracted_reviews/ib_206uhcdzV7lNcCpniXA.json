However the milkshakes, pastries, and fries I've had here have all been fantastic. Order their truffle fries and a milk shake for a classed up version of the old frosty and fries combo at Wendy's. Beware though, it's kind of expensive for what you get - but it's Singapore, everything is expensive.",

Of course we had to order the truffle fries based on the recommendations. I had the eggs benedict and my friend had the pesto pasta. I must admit her pesto looked really good, but my benedict was everything I was looking for as well. The truffle fries more than lived up to expectations. I definitely recommend this place and hope to return!",

Choose between regular tables or low couches if you're intending to kick \u00a0back and do some reading. This is one of the first places in Singapore where I tried the Sticky Date Pudding and it was pretty good. Careful with the caramel or it could get a little too sweet. The general standard of food is good with your typical modern bistro spread with the only factor being ridiculous pricing. Other than that, people do indeed come for the environment. With an urbanized landscape like ours, how often do you get to sit facing a mini forest and enjoy your cuppa.",

    "text": "A lot of people say that as a brand, PS.Cafe's food is a little pricey, considering the quality. While not entirely unfair, I do feel that there's a consistency that is worthy of appreciation.Of all the branches, this is my favourite for a casual night out. Nestled amidst lush greenery, when you sit outdoors it's almost possible to forget you're still in Singapore. Almost no roads in sight, just vegetation, it's a nice place to spend the evening, or even an afternoon. The food and drink are, to me, are more than satisfactory. I love their house salad, a mixed green salad livened up by blueberries, sunflower seeds, and a delicious pomegranate dressing. Very addictive. I also thoroughly enjoy their mud crab pasta. While I usually don't order crab because I'm lazy to work for my food, the flavour of the crab blends very well with the sauce, and I order it almost every time I go. They have a great mushroom soup, though I forget exactly what they call it, and an excellent selection of cocktails. Their truffle fries are also a big hit, though the lactose intolerant should be aware that theirs come served with cheese. When I first heard of PS.Cafe though, it was for their cakes and desserts. The Chocolate Blackout is IMMENSE, and I refuse to believe anyone can finish it alone. Their puddings are really good, though I found their key lime pie just 'okay'. Overall it's a little pricey to be a regular fixture on my weekly schedule, but a great place to head to when you want to meet up with friends you haven't seen in forever. It can be a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights though, so if you're hoping for long intense conversations... it's not always ideal.",

Fer realz.All the P.S. Cafe outlets are pretty solid when it comes to food quality, I've found. What they offer in terms of locations, though, is atmosphere and ambiance. THIS spot has the most relaxing brunch views of them all. The outdoor area opens up onto grass -- and lots of it. Bring the kids and the pram, let them run around while you sip your soy latte (soy! yay!) and read the paper as you tuck into some waffles. COME EARLY as it's clearly no secret that this is a popular place for brunchin.' You will have to wait unless you get here when they open, which is at 10am. But you won't regret it. You could hang onto that table all afternoon iffin ya wanna. My only complaint (and hence the 4 stars instead of 5) is that the service is patchy. I should not have to ask you to top up my water. I also should not have to flail my arms wildly on the patio to get your attention. And I should not have to wait 15 minutes for you to bring my bill, only to discover that you've brought the wrong bill, and then worry that you don't know what we ordered in the first place. Get those last bits together, Harding, and we'll be on our way to 5-star brunch paradise.",

On entering the restaurant, The zinc roof, large yellow round lamps, lounge music and beautiful view gives the restaurant a unique rustic feel, while still providing a relaxing and air-conditioned environment for patrons to dine comfortably.Food - Portion of food was decent, however, price is a bit on the high side. Chicken Rossa Penne- This pasta dish offers an interesting and rich mix of delicious ingredients (chicken, bacon, mushrooms) served in creamy tomato sauce. PS. Fish & Chips - we had better fish & chips elsewhere. However, the fish fillets and fries were still delicious enough for our palatesBBQ Ribs- succulent and juicy pork ribs are covered in a thick layer of barbeque blackcurrant sauce, wonderfully tender and moist!PS.Profiteroles - sinful dessert that was pretty normal, cream puffs covered in chocolate sauce and embellished with almond flakes.Truffle Shoestring Fries - Juicy fries are endowed with truffle oil, and topped off with just a tad of grated Parmesan cheese and parsley.Overall, soft lighting, relaxing music, unimpeded view of the greenery, and rustic restaurant d\u00e9cor make this the perfect place for hanging out with friends and loved ones.

    "text": "This outlet, while quaintly surrounded by the greenery, is not recommended if you don't drive - well you can take a cab there but will have to call for a cab when you're done. Unless you don't mind the walk through dempsey down to holland road to take the bus. It's a really romantic atmosphere if you're walking in here in the evening, the pathway is lined with candles before you enter the bustling cafe. It's usually full of people, you'd be lucky to get a table on weekends without making a reservation. I've been here for dinner once, I found the food too average for the price (or maybe I didn't order the right stuff). Had the chicken parmiggiano and truffle fries. The chicken was a little bland and the fries, while served in a generously hefty portion, significantly lacked the truffle flavour, it almost feels like they forgot the truffle somehow. I like the touch of parmesan cheese on top but could do with more cheese!I've also been here for a tea break. My friend and I were on a pie hunt and PS cafe have some really good pies. Their display of desserts will have you salivating! I had the key lime pie while my friend had the chocolate walnut pie. The key lime pie was an absolute delight of citrus burst in your mouth, so refreshingly good! I just didn't like whip cream on top of it that had some coconut sprinkles, I'll be sure to tell them to skip that the next time I order it, the pie is fine on its own. The walnut pie was really rich, we couldn't finish it!Final verdict: Come here for a nice date night or if you live nearby otherwise there are other more accessible PS Cafes in town but definitely DO NOT miss out on the key lime pie! Oh but not all outlets serve the key lime pie though, the one at Ann Siang for one, doesn't serve the key lime.",

The menu has favorites such as a big breakfast, truffle fries, a hearty mushroom soup and decadent desserts.

Great for tea.---Atmosphere---PS Cafe on 28B Harding Road isn't easy to find unless you know what you're looking for, but when you do find it, you'll realize why. The entrance is to the \"back\" of the establishment if you're coming from Dempsey Hill, and is located on Harding Road on the way to the White Rabbit. It's sunk low into the ground, on a hill.The interior decor is astounding, and it clearly reflects its founders' taste in fashion and design (did you know that PS Cafe stands for Project Shop Cafe, for back when it was a cafe attached to a fashion goods store?) A tall ceiling combined with floor-to-ceiling glass partitions keeps the venue air-conditioned and cool while maintaining the feel that you're still sitting in a cafe in the middle of a rainforest. While the view looks down the hill at the side of a clump of trees/the forest, it actually adds to the experience as the wood is mirrored in the construction of PS Cafe.Chalkboards subtly hint at menu options in discreet locations, while the volume stays at a level where you're not afraid to talk above a whisper, but neither are you struggling to hear what your buddies are talking about.Score: 4.5/5---Food/Drinks---My buddy and I split a slice of the Golden Banana Butterscotch Cake. Originally, I thought we were going to order our own slices, but then he pointed out how big they were. They're quite sizable, and for tea or dessert, one is perfectly fine for two people to share. It wasn't overly dry nor wet, and the taste of banana was subtle and not overbearing. It was accompanied by ice cream, which complimented it perfectly. For the price you're paying, it was well worth it.I had a Grapefruit Lychee Caipiroska, which I thought was splendid and refreshing for the hot day that it was. A little too much ice for my liking, but it came with sliced grapefruit and lychees floating inside, a touch of effort which I greatly appreciate in a drink. Flavorful and yummy, took the edge off of the vodka that was used, which was perfect.I will add a caveat that this place has me wanting to come back after seeing my friend's coffee affogato and smelling the truffle fries from the table next to ours.Score: 4/5---Service---Polite and friendly would be how I would describe service. Despite ordering maybe two drinks and one food dish, the servers let us continue to sit for about two hours, even though the first sitting for dinner was already filtering in and being served (I felt woefully underdressed in my shorts at this point in time, lol).Score: 4/5---Miscellaneous---Nothing to say here that I haven't already said.Score: nil/5",

    "text": "The view and location reminds me a lot of Ubud, in Bali amidst the greenery. I come here almost every Sunday, and it was never the time we don't queue up for atleast a good 20 minutes. It is always so packed!The food is good- I tried the steak sandwich and the burger. They come with fries on the side, instead of normal fries I normally switch it to truffle fries. Ordering the truffle fries alone is such a waste as I only come with one other person. The truffle fries comes in big serving... And I can't get enough of it! It's damn good! I like the chicken parmigiana too. The spaghetti aglio olio was alright.Lastly, don't go home without having dessert. Everyone kept saying the pecan lime cake, but please do try the banana butterscoth which comes with ice cream! It's so on point and u will never regret it. It's a big portion, so you might want to share it with someone :)",

    "text": "\"The ambience is nice, but the food is so-so.\" - I'm definitely misquoting Paik Choo here. For ladies-that-lunch and you KNOW you need to have that little finger crooked while you sip your tea with a slice of lemon. If being seen while you have your coffee and cake is important, then THIS is the place.Service - The waiters are generally more pleasant and attentive. The hostess had an incredible dismissive and disdainful attitude. She actually made me feel bad for trying to spend money at her place of employment. Too bad I was too lazy to find another place to eat. Damn my lack of principles! And I found such a nice sheltered parking lot, too.Food - Truffle fries - Meh. Shepard's pie - salty, other assorted mains, too uneventful to remember. Reuben sandwich (see pic) sad and wilted.Desserts - Cakes are huge. But expensive. So share if you must. Cakes are on the dry side. And had a dense sponge texture. Like a kitchen sink sponge. Not that I have tasted one. (That's my story I'm sticking to it.)Price - The price of starters and entrees are stupidly expensive. I mean, seriously ridiculous. \u00a0$8 for a coke, go figure. $28 to $40 for entrees. Desserts are about $18. Wha-what?Final note: I come here at most once a year. Only because I work 5 minutes away, and its a nice place to bring overseas colleagues to impress them. I am shallow that way. But beyond that, there are a million other places with better food and better service.",

    "text": "We've been to the restaurant on Dempsey Hill a couple of times now. The first time around was for brunch on the weekend. It was packed. We were both cheating our Paleo lifestyle because we weren't feeling well and were craving comfort food. I had the special, which was crab cakes and poached eggs (I think - it's been awhile). The food was awesome and so was the long black coffee. They brought us a dish of honey for our coffee that was awesome - thick, gooey, and not overly sweet. Not a big deal to most, but I take my coffee pretty seriously! :) Hubby ordered the shepherd's pie, which was good, but not what he expected. It's a bit different than the American version because it has ground beef prepared similar to spaghetti sauce inside of it. The views were gorgeous and we were very pleased.Our second trip was for dinner last night. We sat outside and I started out with the Pimm's Cooler, which is my favorite drink in all of Singapore thus far. I ordered the burger, hold the cheese and the bun and he got the chicken parm, hold the cheese and croutons. Totally hit the spot, and our server did a great job delivering our order - I know we can be a pain trying to make dishes work for Paleo. This place is definitely our speed and we'll be back again and again.",

The seasoning was delightful, the vegetables had excellent flavor, and the presentation was beautiful. My husband had the smoked salmon benedict and it was superb. The hollandaise sauce was good, not a easy task. The service was good, attentive while still allowing us to enjoy the table. The only reason that I am not giving this 5 stars is because the desserts were not as good as they could have been--not as decadent--given their description and presentation. (I have only been impressed with one dessert in Singapore, but I think PS.Cafe has what it takes to get the desserts on the map.) Frosting on M's Carrot Cake, though perfect in taste and texture, is not enough in quantity given the size of the slice. It needs layers of frosting throughout to take it to the next level. Dark Chocolate Banana Cheesecake had a suggestion of dark chocolate on the top. When the first words are \"dark chocolate\" I am looking for dark chocolate and this was Banana Cheesecake, though again the flavor was excellent and the texture was heavenly.Flourless Orange Cake with orange butterscotch sauce was delicious. The orange was subtle, the butterscotch sauce superb, but I think again this is more of a cheesecake than a flourless cake. I will return and order dessert as I desperately want to find the 5th star!",

I ordered some curry rosemary lamb meatballs with long grain rice. The meatballs came in the size of ping pong balls. I like how the balls had the very mild lamb taste and stuffed a few pine nuts for that few surprise chews. We also ordered truffle fries. I have tried their fries at Ann Siang Hill outlet prior to this and it was delicious. But this outlet over fried the fries. So my friends didn't get why I was raving about it.Overall this is a nice cafe for relaxing if you have a car or take cab. I took around 10 mins walk from the nearest bus stop.",

It would even raise a few eyebrows in Beverly Hills for the audacity of the brunch menu prices but ... welcome to Singapore! If it's even remotely decent western food it's going to be priced like truffle oil. I usually do soup and/or salad and have to say the lunch menu has never let me down. This is on par with the cafes I used to grab lunch in San Francisco. I also get the most consistently good soy lattes here. Dinner time is a little more dressy. It's a nice spot to come for a good cocktail and a nice meal out on the patio. Brunches are a zoo. Seriously, it's like Disneyland on New Years if you come on a Sunday. The brunch food is pretty good though I've occasionally had some very sketchy [read: raw whites] eggs. Now this happens a lot around town so even in high end places I've kinda given up on my old friend eggs benny. Desserts are to die for. The carrot cake is my current crush but I also had a brief entanglement with the ginger toffee cake that could have got serious. Don't miss dessert even if you have to take it to-go.",

One main dish, a pasta, was very far from \"al dente\".Also, ordered a fresh juice from the menu and asked for a small extra. The waiter answered a \"no can\" because... we were told from the staff the juices are pre-mixed, not freshly made - well, but the menu offered \"fresh\" juices.

    "text": "Really like this place can't believe I've only just discovered it - have always known it was here, but its so well hidden behind the foliage in Dempsey that you don't really notice it when you drive past - it has a little secret garden feel to it walking up to the place, but once you're inside its high ceilings, lights, cake, laughter - the quiet exterior is completely different from the warm interior. Although pricey, it is a lovely place to go for a special night out or a date - and the food is surprisingly good! \u00a0The portions are big, and the ribs that I had were drop off the bone fantastic - even better than the ones at Lawry's the Prime Rib! The meat was soooo succulent and easy to take off the bone, and the coleslaw and fried onions that accompanied it were executed just as well.The fries ($12) are huge, thus explaining the price. You could happily share a plate between 4 people - but it smelt so strongly of bottled truffle oil that it really took the flavour of the fries themselves away. Think it would have been better served salted and with sweet chilli and aioli. All in all a very good experience, will be going back again!",

Had some coffee there and the sights are just great. You almost feel like you're in the great outdoors, only in the safe confinement of a modern structure. The parking is fantastic. There are several reasons why I might brag about it, firstly its free, secondly its just by the road so its only a short distance walk, thirdly its a change from all the systematic parking you'll find in Singapore. I do enjoy good parking lots :PThe one and only reason why I frequent this place, the ambiance is to die for! And the parkings great, and the architecture is inspiring, and the service is decent, and the food is pretty good, and the coffee is good.... Yeah you get my point.",

Coffee is great, my cake was average.The rest of the food looked very nice though, and people seemed happy about theirs :-)It's a typical place for expats, with a friendly but quite \"posh\" service, no real warmth in the service.Seems a lot like the place to be because it has been declared as such, and not because it fully deserves it.",

But I love the vibe of the original restaurant at Dempsey and I can't ever complain about my favorite sticky date pudding so I will always keep coming back.Whenever I visit PS Cafe, I'll always order the sticky date pudding or the ginger pudding. Both are delicious and I always make room for them. Not a fan of anything a la mode though, so I usually request for the ice-cream on the side, or not at all. Their cakes go great with tea (or coffee, if you are on that side of the camp) and their selection is fair but nothing to gush over.My favorite thing about PS Cafe at Harding Road is its amazing location and how it feels like a greenhouse that's cool (thank you air-conditioning) and yet is surrounded by greenery everywhere. And the best part is how a lot of the greenery was kept as it was and isn't some pruned garden that they created around the restaurant. It makes for a lovely afternoon visit so you can enjoy being surrounded by nature.",

Sitting remotely in that beautiful greenery, which just adds to the effect. However, the most beautiful architecture does not help when the main purpose of a place does not live up to its premise.We arrived late Sunday afternoon for tea and drinks and had to wait for some time to order. The guy seemed funny at first but then pulled a face at my husbands order of a Negroni and a salad. Sounds strange but I was there..When our drinks and food arrived, my husband had to get rid of around 10 ice cubes from his drink, reducing the (very watery and non-Negroni tasting) cocktail to a shot.My Bloody Mary was ok but for the price I was expecting a highball size, at least, and not a water glass.To cut the whole story short, we stayed longer, enjoyed the view and the quiet, but the service (we had 5 different people over the course of our stay attending to us, extremely slow, kept forgetting orders etc.) would've made me leave otherwise.I wanted to love it, but the extortionate bill does not match the service provided or the \"OK\" food - not to mention the inconsistency with drinks.",

    "text": "Guys, before I even START my review, I have to sing the praises of PS's HEAVENLY sticky date pudding. That was the BEST dessert to EVER hit my tongue. I can't believe it. It was hot, moist, just the right density, the sauce was perfectly caramelly with just a little saltiness, and the vanilla bean icecream completed the whole thing. Like, man. That was so good. Two things to know before dining here: if it's busy, you might wait 40+mins for food, and if you're sitting outside, bring mosquito repellent. There's not many bugs out there, but if you're like me and happen to be a walking Mozzie Buffet, sitting right by the jungle can be an....er, interesting experience. HOWEVER. The food here is great! I absolutely LOVED their Pad Thai Salad - the prawns were tender and well cleaned, the veggies were fresh and crunchy, and the peanut sauce and flavourful spices were delicious. 10/10 would order again. I also loved their ranges of Gin - the subtle tastes and flavours were really fun to explore. Tried the truffle fries and honestly don't have too much to say. They were pretty average, and the first batch we had to send back to the kitchen because they were stone cold :/ the hot ones were nice enough, but I wouldn't order them again. Also, I've already raved about their Sticky Date, but we also grabbed PS's specialty brownie...which actually wasn't that great, to be honest! It looks FASCINATING, stacked a mile high with huge fluffy marshmallows and covered with ganache, but the brownie itself was more the consistency of a sponge, and it was sickeningly sweet. Even the ice cream wasn't enough of a break between the hectic chocolate gooeyness, so we all ended up going cross-eyed from sugar overload and only eating 1/4 of the slice all up. Considering the calibre of the other meals we ordered, this one was a bit of a disappointment. Service: 4/5 starsFood: 4/5 stars overallAtmosphere: 5/5 starsSpeed: 1.5/5 stars on a busy day.",

    "text": "I came here on a Thursday night with a friend. We usually operate on a tight budget so this was a rare indulgence for both of us. I ordered the PS Burger and shared a plate of truffle fries and a sticky date pudding with my friend. I wasn't a huge fan of the burger as I felt like it was a little bland. The fries that came with the burger, however, were thickly cut and wonderful! They came with a mayo dip that seemed to be infused with a zesty taste and some herb that I couldn't quite identify. In short, it was wonderful.The truffle fries and pudding were, as always, sinful goodness. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to visit the cafe. The atmosphere was great, as always, but service was slow. We came before the peak dining period but still faced issues with having our water refilled in a timely fashion. Though, that wasn't too big of an issue in the grander scheme of things. All in all, a great place to visit!",

However, service is bad, I visited this restaurant twice and both times it took really long to wave your hands around to get attention of staff to come to serve you. Some staff even got annoyed when being called them. Food quality is not matching the expensive price. I tried several main dishes there but they could not make any good impact on my memory.",

    "text": "The PS Cafe on Harding Road is a really nice refuge from the people and noise of the city. In general I am a city person but sometimes it is nice to go somewhere calmer. I have always felt that it is nice and calm and have always received good service here even when it is busy. The food is however nothing special, I have had some of the brunch dishes such as as the pad thai and the 'leftover' lasagna. The pad thai is decent but considering that there are a lot of Thai restaurants in Singapore I would say that one can get it cheaper and better elsewhere. The lasagna is nice but not something to base a visit on.What I mostly like to do here is actually just have a drink and enjoy the environment. If it is busy they will most likely want you to eat something and my experience that most things are decent but nothing is outstanding or surprising. I do still not necessarily think that it is bad thing, I do sometimes not seek the new or exciting thing and then this can very well do.",

My friends and I visited PS Cafe for tea and dessert. Although we planned for just having the cakes, we had to order the truffles fries- the smell was just too tempting! The desserts are alright- not bad! I say- visit this place if u have to chill and enjoy the ambiance.",
