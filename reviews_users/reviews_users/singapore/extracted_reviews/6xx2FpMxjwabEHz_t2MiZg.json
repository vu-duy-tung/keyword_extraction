Perhaps my expectations were too high. But I did not enjoy the scrambled eggs, which were watery and not creamy. Coffee was weak too. Was the latte art of a teddy bear supposed to convince me otherwise? Decided to give the place another try and dropped by for a snack. Ordered the crostini with pesto, mozzarella and garlic, which sounded oh-so-trendy on the menu but turned out to be a few sad slices of toast with hard and bland mozzarella and some pesto and garlic. Overpriced, in my view and trying too hard to keep up with its image of a trendy, cafe.The second star I've given is for the nice decor and ambiance. \u00a0Now, if only the food can match \u00a0up.",

    "text": "Club Street Social is a lovely place to have brunch at. It's located on hip Club Street, on a side road right at the fringe of the area (tip: it's near the Spizza outlet). Club Street Social mainly serves sandwiches and crostinis. Try the prosciutto panini - it is to die for. The atmosphere at the restaurant is lively, with a tres chic crowd being the main clientele. Tables are set rather closely together though, to maximize the small space, so private and salacious conversations should be saved for after (maybe grab drinks at nearby Indochine?). The restaurant gives off a non-Singapore vibe - I've heard people remark more than once that they feel like they've been transported back to Chicago or New York. It's true though - it really is a lovely place to do weekend brunch at, while recovering from a hangover. Oh, and the best thing is that this place is pet friendly. So don't be afraid to bring your best mate down to brunch.",

Service was good and the staff were relaxed and friendly. The place was empty at 2:30 PM on a Tuesday but got full by around 4:00 PM or so.

Nice atmosphere and generally good service but you will have a better time if you come in a small cosy group.We visited the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm. Cos the venue is not set up for large groups, we were already told that our group of 12 will be split into 2 tables upon reservation.When we arrived, the servers seemed confused when we quoted our reservation. Took a few minutes before the could clearly tell us which two were our tables.As the group came in a staggered fashion, orders were put in as and when our friends arrived so we could just proceed with lunch.It was unfortunate that there were also 2 other groups of 6 - 7 pax that came around the same time that afternoon so the kitchen got really busy.Some orders were wrong and others took a lot more time. We ended up cancelling one of the mains cos it was just too long.The servers were helpful but it's really unfortunate that the inability to cope with multiple groups dampened the mood.",

What's good would be the egg & bacon panini soaked in butter maple syrup. It is still as good as before. Ask for more butter maple syrup for your indulgence! The duck confit, portobello panini is juicy!!! I love how the canard flavour burst in my mouth. It is a perfect place for a lazy afternoon brunch with great food and self-denial, thinking that I am in NY mode.

Nothing too fancy, just a classy place for all of the above. Cozy up to the bar, order one of their signature sandwiches, test the bartender's knowledge with an off-menu cocktail and appreciate what all of Singapore (at least all of Singapore's ex-pats anyway) have already discovered.

    "text": "A big reason why I decided to come here was that I didn't believe. I'd seen the menu online, and never thought that any panini in any form could be worth so much. Oh how wrong I was proven to be!The waiter was very prompt to recommend the confit duck, roast portobello and balsamic onion panini, and I was equally quick to say yes yes yes. After quite a wait, the panini was served on a simple plate, looking perfectly toasted, with a little bulbs of onion in a little jam bowl on the side, blackened in sweet balsamic.One bite and I felt sooo vindicated. The texture of the confit duck was so smooth, not at all the dry shreds that confit de canard often prove to be. There was a little taste of pate in it, not that there was pate in it, but perhaps the smooth texture reminded me of it, yet it was evidently still duck meat at its most tender. The addition of the roasted portobello was also very generous, covering almost every bit of the panini. The end result was that each bite secreted a lot of juice, and a truck-ful of goodness. My friend had the truffled egg toast, of which I took a bite. It seemed pretty decent, yet nothing mind blowing (especially when you hope the truffle taste would be real prevalent). It was ultimately meant to be a simple dish with a sophisticated flavour, but perhaps I had not tried a good enough portion of the dish to be blown away. It did look very lush though.I'd also like to point out that the service here was top notch - everyone smiling and willing, and very prompt to re-fill our cups of water when they were running dry.",

The nice lighting and mirrors created an intimate ambience, suited for catching up with friends over a glass of cocktail or beer! It's a very popular hangout place, especially for Caucasians. On my first visit, I was surprised that we were the only few locals there. The rest of the customers were all 'ang-mohs'. Service was great - everyone was friendly and full of smiles. The waiter was very patient and helpful in providing us with food recommendations. They were also quick at refilling out cups whenever it's running dry. In addition, this place provides free WiFi and is also pet friendly.Their crostinis are superb! I tried the goat cheese crostini which tasted really crispy. Together with the lemony thyme and sweet honey, it's a great combination. It comes in threes ($9) or in fives ($13). The only thing that I disliked was the price - it's too expensive! $3 for 1 small, pathetic piece! You'll never get full for eating this.I didn't like the duck confit panini ($19). In fact, I think it's overrated. Thought the bread was and the duck was tender, it was way too oily. The only thing that surprised me was the red pickled onions. It's actually quite mild and sweet. Perhaps I'm too picky, but to pay almost $20 for a sandwich, I certainly expected much more.Club Street Social is the place to go if you don't mind spending for quality Italian food.I find this place too pricey for the quantity you get (I'm a value guy). I would probably be satisfied enough to have a cheaper sandwich in another caf\u00e9. The high price will surely deter me from coming back.",

I like the fact that it's tucked right behind Club St, so one can skip out on the associated noise and clutter. For brunch, it's an OK place, their yogurt granola platter is fine, but nothing memorable. The coffee, however, is quite remarkable, and the locality, with it's open floor-to-cieling doors, lends it self to sitting to enjoy a coffee on a Saturday morning anyways.",

It is pretty much a fluffy piece of toast coated with melted cheese and truffle oil and a runny egg yolk in the middle of it. I would give this dish a higher rating if the salt was more evenly distributed. Some bites were too salty, but the overall taste was really really tasty. The salads here are really good too. It's hard to find a nice fresh salad, but I love their romaine salad here. The only drawback of this place is that I think the brunch items and salads are better than their mains, which were the paninis. The lobster and avocado filling was pretty tasty, but the paninis were just too oily, not crispy enough and too heavy.",

    "text": "This review is for their brunch although I hear it's also a pretty cool bar and nightlife hangout.We had brunch on a Sunday at 1pm and the place was surprisingly empty. It soon filled up shortly after our arrival so perhaps we just got lucky.The service was friendly and good. The $8 mimosa specials were very nice and a good price.The brunch menu needs help though... I wish they had some more traditional brunch egg dishes like eggs benedict and omelets, pancakes, etc.The toasted egg bake thing I had was not worth writing home about (or writing about on Yelp even).My wife had a scrambled egg dish with sausages. The sausages were very tasty but the side of bacon I ordered was not that great. Perhaps it was beef bacon? Not sure.My wife's egg dish came with like 20 eggs (or so it looked). It was huge.We'd probably come back here as we enjoyed the ambiance, the open air decor of the venue, and the chilled out crowd. Hopefully the brunch fare will improve in the future!",

    "text": "I've read many reviews and heard a lot about the brunch and the drinks at Club Street Social, so I was really excited to finally get the chance to visit. The place is a small, so it's definitely a good restaurant for a nice date/small size of people. Overall, the restaurant/bar has a very energetic vibe thanks to the music and the lively clientele. The drinks are pricey, but I guess it's justified by the creativeness in them. I had the 3rd and #7, the former was good, but a bit too \"light\" in flavor for my taste, while the latter was amazing if you're like me and tend to go for dark liquors combined with flavorful ingredients. We had the lobster panini - the bread had a very good crunch to it and was perfectly warm. The creamy lobster avocado filling was satisfying while not being heavy either. We also had the \u00a0herb crusted chilean cod - it was perfectly cooked and the portion was substantial. We ended dinner with the nutella bread pudding - I'm not a fan of chocolate and can be very critical when it comes to bread pudding, but I must say that this bread pudding is good! It had the right amount of moistness and firmness, and not coyingly sweet either. I'm going back!",

    "text": "In search of a decent panini, I came to Club Street Social. I was immediately delighted by the decor--very clean with dark paneling and tile reminiscent of the New York Subway--and even happier with the food. I have been generally underwhelmed by Singapore's sandwich offerings (and don't even get me started on the impossibility of finding a non-restaurant grade panini press) but my prosciutto panini with truffle mayo was absolutely delicious. I got the mayo on the side so it wouldn't overpower the other flavors and highly recommend doing that. The goat cheese and thyme crostini were also a great mix of flavors and a very generous proportion of topping to bread, just the way I like it.Of course, you'll pay an arm and a leg for the food (it is quality Western food in Singapore after all) and that's the only thing stopping me from maxing out the stars.",

Served in a champagne coupe for extra speakeasy feels :) The brunch is nice also, and the layout makes for easy movement in the restaurant out to the small patio.They did close fairly early (11:30 ish) for a Saturday night.",

The service dithers from very, very good to ambivalent (depends on who you get).There's also a good all-day breakfast. The food is delish: try the duck rillette crostini with figs, as well as the goat cheese and thyme crostini. The paninis are lovely. I've always been too full for dessert but the nutella bread pudding sounds amazing.They take their cocktails quite seriously too. There's a cocktail with bacon in it... if you're up to it!",

    "text": "I was so lost trying to find the place it's not funny!But once you find it, I think you will not lose it again. Club Street Social is a \"New-York inspired\" bistro/bar which I first thought must be a chi-chi place. However when I visit it it was rather casual and relaxed with normal looking people, so I was surprised! The decor of the place also really fitting of the theme, and quite impressive.I must say the service was super excellent. When I was there and ordered an iced latte it did not arrive after a while. But when I checked, the waiter gave it to me and said it was on the house as they have missed out on the order! Well isn't that nice. I was really pleased with it. We also ordered some finger food and it was delicious. I've also heard that they serve brunch there so I might go back there to try it, since the place and the service there already convinced me it is a good spot.",

    "text": "Walked in at 1pm on a Sat and I did not have to wait for a table of 3. They let me sit down even though my 2 other friends have not arrived yet - something which does not happen in NYC. I shared the truffle toast and the Panini with prosciutto, tomato, mozzarella, and truffle mayo. The scrambled egg was one of the best I've ever had. So buttery and well-seasoned I couldn't stop eating it. The Panini was tasty too and good to share with a friend for a balanced meal! Only complaint was the cappuccino was served in such a small cup I finished it in 3 gulps.",
