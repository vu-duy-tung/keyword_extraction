Their drink menu is extensive (and expensive) and includes a flaming Chuck Norris signature cocktail (Hint: don't drink the chuck norris).The owners are lovely and very invested in making this a cool place to hang. Love!",

    "text": "Pretty cool bar in the middle of Tiong Bahru. \u00a0On Thursdays and Fridays usually packed with a mixture of expats and locals. \u00a0The bar also shows certain football and rugby games and tends to have specials on those days as well. They have a variety of beers as well as different appetizer specials for happy hours daily. \u00a0The staff is relatively helpful and friendly. \u00a0They stop serving food rather early (10:30) pm on some days and if the bar is emptyish could be even earlier. The happy hour isn't much of a discount and the prices are pretty typical of an expat bar. \u00a0Still the bar is worth a visit if you are in the area!",

    "text": "Fun find in the up and coming neighborhood of Tiong Bahru. If you're unfamiliar with the area, getting here can seem a bit tricky as the location is a bit off on the map. If you get out at Tiong Bahru Plaza, cross Tiong Bahru Road (towards Jalan Membina) and go left towards Kim Tian Road, which runs parallel to Jalan Membina. Take a right on Kim Tian, and it'll be a little bit past Big Mama, the Korean restaurant. If you're a brisk walker like I am, it's about a 5 minute walk!*Now back to our regularly scheduled review* In an attempt to show off my work neighborhood, I decided to bring my husband here tonight for a weeknight dinner. It wasn't too busy, and because the weather was cooperating, most people were hanging out on the patio. The inside is spacious and trendy, with warm lighting. Again, it's one of those places that utilizes those really cool lights that all the hipster places have!They specialize in craft beer and cider, but sadly we weren't in the mood for beer tonight. Their cocktail list is pretty decent, although they can run out of things. (Miguel wanted the Japanese Old Fashioned, and it was out of stock!) We ended up trying the Coq Eye, which is their take on an espresso martini. The verdict? It's a dangerous drink because you can't taste the alcohol!For food, I had their carbonara, which was one of their current specials on the board. For $14, I thought it was well priced for its portion, and good if you're looking for something heavy. Miguel ordered the Brazen Beef Steak, one of their main entrees, but thought it was small and overpriced at $24.They do have TVs here, so I'd imagine that this is a good spot to watch games as the extensive beer list and tapas menu would have you covered. Staff is courteous and proactive in providing suggestions on what to try.Between this place and Fourskin, one's gotta wonder how some of these businesses get away with their names! But I'm not going to complain- glad some people here can handle a sense of humor.",

    "text": "Had high hopes, but quite disappointed. The atmosphere was nice, attractive hip decor. The best part about this place was the amazing music playlist, though it was slightly to loud for having a conversation. The waitress was very persistent about getting our order. Ordered the \"JAPANESE OLD FASHIONED\" which has no relation to an old fashion and tasted like smokey water (no flavor of alcohol at all). When I let them know, their response was that was how it was supposed to taste. They gave me half off so pretty much I paid for a $9 glass of water. The food was sub par especially considering the price. I then proceeded to get a whisky on the rocks which came with a glass full of ice.... probably 15 cubes. You'd expect a \"gastropub\" to know better!The only reason I would go here if it was during happy hour and I wanted to play foosball.....",

I like to stick to the classics and mostly whatever's on tap. I've tried a few bites to eat and I think it's not too shabby. Nothing to shout abt, but for the prices, I reckon the quality is still there and I'm not complaining. I've tried the katsu curry chicken, the steak and the fries and spam fries. All in all, it's a great place to wind down with 90s alternative hits like Weezer, incubus etc.. Plus I can have a decent meal there if I'm hungry. Worth a night to check it out. Service is good an friendly too not forgetting!",

It was extremely comfy, and had too much of a home feel: I loved it! The service was amazing, and the waitress informed us right away of any drink specials they were having, while not being too pushy, of course. Their menu was pretty straightforward, comfort food which is what they promised. All my friends had a burger which was amazing, and those fries, hands down the best I've had in Singapore to date. Their fried crispy garlic chicken was exactly that, and I can't emphasize how comforting the food was. I saw on the website they often have live music, so would be cool to check out then. For Sunday brunch though, can't complain it has everything you might want: good food, good drink specials, and the fact that you can walk around Tiong Bahru afterwards. Highly recommended indeed!",

    "text": "Another one of those completely random and yet serendipitous finds when wandering around in search of booze. The joint was partly hidden behind some construction, upon which was boldly spray painted \"BALLS WILL ROLL\". Intrigued, we headed in and were informed that C&B would only be officially opened the next day, but we were welcome to have drinks if we so wished. Magic words, my friend, magic words.The place is done up literally brick and mortar style, and has a rough, edgy look to it. A section of roller shutters is used in place of a chalk board, and photo frames of ostriches adorn the brick wall. Very interesting! And the loo looked like something out of a derelict and haunted mental hospital, what with its rickety metal washbasin. Tres cool.A really delightful girl named Sylvia came up and chatted with us, and we were told that we were first customers. Go us! She also recommended us some beers and as C&B specialises in imported beers, there was a pretty good variety available. We started off with the recommended poisons - Swedish strawberry and lime cider, and a couple of Japanese red and white beers. As bloody Marys and mojitos are typically our poisons of choice, Sylvia helped ask the bartender if he could come up with a concoction, given that these were not on the menu. To our surprise, he obliged, and whipped up an awesome mojito - strong, sweet, tangy and deliciously minty. The Bloody Mary, he promised, would be for our next visit down, and he'd tweak it with chilli padi and curry powder for a proper Asian kick. Sold, I say! Round two: more booze to be had - a blond that had an oddly metallic smell but neutral taste, a crisp pear cider and yet another of the yummy mojitos. By the time the bill came round, we were very happily on our way to sloshdom. To our surprise, we were given 25% off drinks, which was a very kind gesture on the part of C&B, especially so when the launch that night was meant only for friends. Next strategic move: to become best buds with Sylvia and bartender!",
