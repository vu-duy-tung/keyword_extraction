Good alternative to Nam Nam which always seems jampacked. Have only tried a couple of noodle dishes and the flavours remind me of Singapore hawker food. Will be back to try other things on the menu.",

The dish was very plain and nothing really interesting about the flavors or mix. The banana dessert was not fresh. I found the service to be quick but really disengaged like a fast food joint. Bottom line...overall I find this place to be ok. Come here for the good viet variety and speed but don't expect good service!

As the soup was tasty, I wondered if I would feel thirsty afterwards but it was fine so I believe that the food relied on natural ingredients for the good taste.",

The crispy netted seafood roll and crispy fried squid are pretty good but eat them when it's hot. The Banh Bao... well I had better. And to pay $7.90 for two buns each with half an egg is pricy for me.You pick a seat when it's not crowded, otherwise they'd seat you such that they fill the place. There are some by-the-wall seats is you visit alone. The menus are on each table and you fill out the order form before proceeding to the cashier. They accept cash and credit cards. The staff are quite friendly and they are Vietnamese. All in all quite a decent place if you crave for Vietnamese food.",

The soft beef stew reminds me a lot of rendang and the kimchi fried rice was just nice. All this for $9.90 which is relatively cheap in this area imo. And they gave generous portion of meat too.Will come back again!",

    "text": "Their tagline is \"Broken Rice Bowl\", which they explain somewhere, but I was too hungry to find out why. :PAnyway, I noticed this new concept opened up recently in the Raffles City basement, partly due to the ridiculous queue during lunch. Y'all know my general dislike for Nam Nam, but considering this focused on rice bowls, I figured I'd give it a shot.Not sure what it's like for lunch, but for dinner the ordering process was as follows:1) Stand in queue and wait to be seated.2) Once seated, an employee will give you a menu and write down your table number on the order form.3) Fill in the form with your order.4) Walk up to the cashier and pay.5) Sit back down; they'll deliver your food to you.Their rice bowls are moderately priced; they go for about $8-14. They also have soup dishes, a few appetizers, sodas, Viet coffee, and some desserts as well. I went for the lemongrass and BBQ pork rice bowl, and I was looking forward to trying their tamarind soda but it was unavailable. :(My rice bowl was simply a-ok. I thought the flavours went well together, and the BBQ pork definitely had some kick to it. Portion-wise, it bordered on the small side, considering it's priced at $9.90. Then again, I'm most likely paying for the upscale ambiance, air conditioning and the high rental price in Raffles City.Overall, I like this better than Nam Nam, but just know that you're paying for \"sanitized\" (for lack of a better word) Viet fare. I wouldn't mind coming back for dinner, but you won't find me waiting in that lunchtime queue anytime soon.",

    "text": "Been walking past this place for a few times before I manage to try their food. \"Broken rice\" concept reminds me of the Vietnamese meals I had in the U.S. Due to my experiences that I had in the U.S., I was rather carrying high expectations before trying what this place have to offer.Coming here during lunch hour was a No-no. Pretty crowded and it has the same concept as Nam Nam where you are given a seat and you have to queue to pay for the food and the drinks. What looks \"good\" to me was the beef broken rice bowl. For the drinks, organic apple and guava tempted me.At the cashier, it was rather confusing as two people served me. I took out the drinks from the refrigerator but they did not notice it so one of them had to put back what he brought out. And while making payment, I noticed that on the cash register they placed the wrong amount. So they did gave me extra money and I recalculated it again and told another person that they had charged me less and that money was meant for them. And they forgot to return me my 10 cents. So while thinking, oh well, let them have it, they gave me back my change. Was given a space to seat with other customers. The seat was too cramp but it was a nice table. It was actually a shadow table with fake plants in it (idea for my future home design). Tried my rice but there is something different from the past experiences. And for the beef I was expecting it to be shredded bbq beef and not cubed stewed beef. And for the egg I was expecting steamed egg in layered form not the sunny-side up. I had to acquire the taste for awhile before finishing up my rice. Had to also put fish sauce to obtain the Vietnamese dish flavor.For the organic drink. It was o-ok. Wasn't a wow factor even though I love fruity drinks. It is also made in New Zealand and you need to shake the bottle up to dissolve the undissolved parts of the drink. Overall, price was quite average. But will I be back? Probably won't be soon.I'll have to try the fried chicken broken rice bowl on my next visit.",

The self-serviced eatery was only half-filled, unlike Nam Nam's perpetual full-house. Perhaps the \"broken rice\" concept isn't quite as distinguishing, or as internationally-beloved, as Vietnam's national dish - the comforting pho.We had:1) Spicy Beef Rice Noodle Soup ($9.90): a robust mix of tangy and spicy flavours, but let down by the tough chewy thick slices of beef and undercooked, almost raw beansprouts.2) Vietnamese Sizzling Crepe ($10.90): excellent, with thick slices of tender pork belly, succulent prawns, fresh lettuce, pickled radish and julienned cucumbers. Skip the beansprouts, these had an undercooked alkalinity.3) Napa Cabbage Soup ($5): sweet and delicate, and choc-a-bloc with bouncy juicy squid balls.4) Squash Soup with Pork Ribs ($5): middling; the pork ribs were dry-ish and soup base lacking in depth.5) Crispy Shrimp & Sweet Potato Fritters ($6.50): authentic, but I hated the shells-on shrimp.
