    "text": "I like coming to this shop because the food is great. However, my personal favourite is not their famous herbal Bak Kut Teh soup. Instead, it is like what Richard (fellow yelper) has reviewed, they are very good in their dried claypot dishes. So, my personal favourite is their \"dry\" claypot pork ribs with pork slices. I am not a big fan of innards so I don't usually ask for those. You really must try their dry claypot dishes!! I really really do love them!! It was my mum who introduced us to this shop, and we have been coming here for more than 10 years. They are good in their other zhichar offerings too, so, we typically would order a few dishes to go with the dry claypot Bak Kut (Bak Kut = Pork Ribs). It's been a while that my family come here to eat. I'll have to get them to revisit probably later this year. I miss having their other dishes, especially my favourite prawn omelette.For my recent visit, I came here with my hubby and we had the herbal Bak Kut Teh Soup. I think it tasted pretty good. However, my hubby didn't like it as much as me. He belongs to the camp in SG where he prefers his Bak Kut Teh soup to be clear & peppery. A little warning: no air-conditioning in this eatery. But they do have ample fans operating, so it's still pretty ok.",

It was a pleasant meal in the middle of the night, I am surprise at the hours it open till (4am) and the food is definitely a go-getter kind of standard in my own personal opinion. The dry claypot (I ordered pig kidney. ) is better than I expected. Price is reasonable too. (Around $28 for bat Kut tea (medium), pig kidney (dry) and 3 Rices with a sugarcane drink. (I ate two rice myself whahaha)",

I guess you can say I'm somewhat of a bkt purist; I just like the pork ribs!They do have an extensive menu outside bkt so you can also find items like omelettes and such. I love how they have 2 baskets of chilli: one with big slices and less seeds, and another with smaller pieces and a lot of seeds. A nice way to choose your heat!As they're almost open 24 hours (they close between 430-730 am) it's a great spot for all day dining or late night eats. They do get very busy during peak hours so come in a little early if you're not a fan of queueing!",

Founded in 1983, Sin Heng serves the Hokkien herbal Bak Kut Teh. The house favourite is definitely the Special Bak Kut Teh. Served on a Clay Pot, which many people believe intensifies the flavours, the Special Bak Kut Teh contains the pork spare ribs, innards (although I'm personally not a fan, if eaten alone, I think this gives dish that great flavour), vegetables, mushrooms, etc. \u00a0Serve this dish with rice or youtiao and your in heavenDepending on who you are, you're either a peppery clear soup Bak Kut Teh kind of guy or the Herbal Soup Bak Kut Teh aficionado. As such, I don't think it's a fair to compare Sin Heng with famous pepper clear soup Bak Kut Teh powerhouses like Founders, Song Fa, etc, but rather fellow Herbal Soup Bak kut Teh restaurants. Sorry Sin Heng, in my opinion, Leong Kee Bak Kut Teh in Geylang still has the best Herbal Bak Kut teh in Singapore. Nevertheless, Sin Heng delivers an amazing Herbal Bak Kut teh. Best of all its in my neighborhood of Katong and is open 24-7. \u00a0Will I come back!?!? Absolutely and I still do!!! Seriously, Yahoo, how can you not have Leong Kee Bak Kut Teh on your list!",

It came simmering in a claypot with 2 larges pieces of pork rib. The soup is 8/10 in terms of herbal-ness, clear and doesn't feel heavy. They're also very generous with their mushroom portions and refills.There are 19 fans here so despite not being ac-ed, it was still very comfortable. \u00a0We really enjoy the long opening hours too - 7am to 4am the next day, when do they sleep?!

There was a time I was really naive thinking this is really a tea and of course I realize now it is really a soup.A soup suppose to eat in the morning? As breakfast? But Sin Hen is open from 7:30 am - 4:30 am so I guess any time is good for Bak Koot Teh.We shared a Hokkien's style BKT which was quite bland in taste with no complexity but I love the fresh chopped chili I can just sprinkled all on top of my soup. I could not really taste the herbal taste in the broth much. Maybe the Teochow has a better kick since it is more peppery?Sin Heng is the only Bak Koot Teh I tried during my visit in Singapore so I don't really have any other to compare.

    "text": "Not too far away from the Katong Laksa war zone lies an unassuming restaurant with its facade completely open like a hungry mouth. Do not underestimate this literal hole-in-the-wall. Sin Heng Claypot Bak Koot Teh proves that appearances are merely that: appearances. Their meat bone tea will keep you coming back for more, regardless of how fancily decorated an eatery of a nearby competitor is.Their Claypot Bak Kut Teh is an altered version of the classic recipe. It is peppery with a sophisticated layer of spiciness. As opposed to the strong and direct in-your-face spicy found in fast food restaurants, Sin Heng's spicy is married with herbs, creating an earthy flavor. The cilantro brings a freshness to balance out the pepper and meat. My only complaint: why was there only one soft clove of garlic in the bowl? It is forgivable as the servers made their rounds with free refills on soup.Sin Heng's Special Bak Kut Teh is a custom recipe. Think of it as the grandchild of your classic meat bone tea. Have a sip and immediately you notice it is lighter than the standard bak kut teh. Though the servers will not disclose the specific ingredients used, your taste buds won't lie that it contains more herbs and less pepper than their Claypot Bak Kut Teh.Of the two meat bone teas devoured, the Claypot Bak Kut Teh tastes like the evil twin. But in a delicious, heavy way. As for me I prefer Sin Heng's Special due to its herbal fragrance.",

The meat is soft and comes off the bone easily, yum!Parking can be tricky - if you're lucky you'll find a space in their private carpark (strictly for patrons only), or if not try going a little bit later in the afternoon when it's not so crowded... this place is open all the way till 4am!",
