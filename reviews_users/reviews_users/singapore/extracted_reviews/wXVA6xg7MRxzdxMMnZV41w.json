    "text": "I don't have a lot of experience with Indonesian food, and while I enjoyed the food, I'd categorize this establishment as upscale hawker, primarily because it is a sit-down restaurant with air conditioning.Table settings, chairs, etc. are basic, and while the service is efficient, it is not overflowing.Dan's review is spot on. \u00a0Portions are very ample, while prices are fair (see photos) \u00a0Beer is $6/bottle. While the quality was good, I think the squid could have used more time absorbing the flavors, instead of getting much of the flavor from the generous amount of sauce.Bottom line: I didn't think the food was all too compelling to want to return to, yet if you seek authentic Indonesian food, and particularly if you're with others eager to share multiple dishes, this will satisfy you.",

    "text": "The food is amazing and I am so please I get to try this before I leave Singapore. I recommend this place fully in terms of satay and beef rendang but mostly I was suprised with the chicken curry. This is full of lemon grass flavour. I had ro order another bowl of rice just for the sauce that was left over. I would have even lick the bowl if I wasn't at the restaurant. The satay was amazing and I could eat it all day, slightly different from street one. As it tasted like sweet char sui but with hint of spices. The meat was very juicy and so succulent. One skewer can shared for 2 people but I would say order one each as I didn't want to share because it was that good! Finally the beef rendang was amazing this was melt in your mouth tasty. The sauce was perfect with the right amout of spices and it doesn't \u00a0have a runny \u00a0sauce (the authentic way)! All in all I would give the food 5 stars, the reason for 4 stars was because it says it is open at 11:30am. We went there at 11:34am the staff says they are not open until 15 mins time. So we had to find somewhere to wait, which it wasn't easy.",

    "text": "Food quality is good -- but value for money, think again. This small restaurant has some how convinced itself that it can sell a small piece of BBQ'd squid for $28? Seriously? Squid dishes abound in this neighborhood near Chinatown, at 1/3 to 1/2 the price. Forget ambiance in the small, cramped and dirty downstairs dining area. It is cluttered cute, but nothing more. All I can say is that you really have to love Indonesian food to pay these kind of prices in this level of restaurant. Because there are dozens of classier, cleaner palaces with equally good or better (but not indonesian) food within a few blocks. I came to experience unique Indonesian food, left feeling overcharged and underserved and really thinking that the overall experience wasn't quite worth it.",

He was busy so I ordered some food for to go. When I arrived I wasn't sure what to expect beside the restaurant was not impressive when u walk in you will notice the plastic on top of the tables, but the good thing is there is a huge upstairs that is great for large parties. I saw the owner outside get a parking ticket and we quickly bonded after that and she even gave me a ride back to my hotel. The food was great! I had the curry and my boyfriend had the squid! He said it was one of the best that he has had in his life. I would for sure come back because of the customer service and I am craving one of those line drinks.",

    "text": "Ok. I'll just come out and say it....the owner (I believe) doubled all of our main dish orders. We ordered the fried rice, beef rendang, and sate madura. She made the assumption without asking us to give us (2) orders of Sate, (2) orders of fried rice and the rendang was higher than the menu suggested. The price as $12 - 22?? I should've ask but I trusted her to give us (1) portion for each order. So she charged us $18 bucks for the rendang and it looked like a regular portion. Our bill was $64.35 for (3) dishes that was suppose to be light lunch for us. The overall flavor was just so so and the quality not too good. Oh....the rendang was tough and some parts inedible. Avoid this place! The ambiance also is not cool, small, old, and nothing good. I guess the worst part is that I was taken advantage of on my vacation. If you want good Indonesian food....definitely go to Indo Chili! You will not be disappointed! Avoid. You've been warned. ;)",

    "text": "great for big groups as the portions are really huge and best for sharing. Don't be deceived by the limited seating downstairs, the upstairs seating area is huge and true to style, they have several tok panjang (long tables) that can sit up to 20 or more. It is not halal though and even though it says \"Bali\" it is not Balinese food but more Nasi Padang style. In the day time they have assorted dishes displayed for you to choose from, nasi Padang style. So eating alone is no problem but night time, the solo diners will be more limited in choice. apart from the grilled squid, my favourites will definitely be the sate ayam (chicken satay) which is draped in delicious dark sauce and the portions are huge. One stick is enough for one person's main course. Another specialty is their Ikan bakar (grilled fish) which is more like a fish wrapped with otah. the portions are huge and meant for more than 2. haven't really tried anything unsatisfactory here before but the wait can be long at times especially when crowded.",
