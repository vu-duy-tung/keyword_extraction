    "text": "My late-grandfather once told me while I was but a little pup living with him in Singapore that (loosely translated): \"You are not a REAL Singaporean until you have chicken rice. Not just any chicken rice, but the really GOOD artery-blocking-flavorful-type-with-awesome-chili-that-burns-your-tongue.\"Of course, as an inquisitive child, I asked him where these \"good places\" were and he smirked with a simple reply (loosely translated again), \"Very EASY. When you go to a food centre, look for an \"abnormally long\" line (or queue) that leads up to a chicken rice stall. Line up and then order something. I'm SURE you will like it.\"So it should be of no surprise that my FIRST pilgrimage stop in Singapore after I landed in a flying piece of metal incubator was to look for authentic OLD-school chicken rice.Where did I go? (Well, I didn't know where to start so I decided to follow my uncle and his family to one of the more popular - if not famous - chicken rice spots in Singapore.)There was a line...and in fact, the ONLY line at that kopitiam (aka food court). Not even time for lunch and there was already 20 people ahead of us...yeah, this definitely counts as an \"abnormally long\" line that my late-grandfather described. And the funny thing is...it applies to just about any establishment in Singapore. With food, a long queue usually implies one of the following: (a) the food is fantastic, great, awesome, and a must-try; (b) someone started the flash mob and got people thinking that the food is good...and unknowing cause herds tag along; or (c) they've got dope in their food and you've got no choice but to eat there again (of course I'm joking, this is Singapore...).Ming Kee Bugis St Chicken Rice falls under a \"must-try\". How is it different from the rest? As I learned from my cousin and eventually found out when it was finally our turn to order, the chicken's here take a freaking ICE-BATH after they are specifically cooked (and continue their polar-bear-jump-saga by staying in there until they are to be served chopped up and served on a plate). Not only does this process immediately prevent overcooking but it also brings about a slightly different texture and taste.Oh yeah, it keeps it fresh too...that's a good thing right. (If you never had chicken rice in normal stalls before...they leave it sitting on the counter throughout the day until it is sold out. So if it is one of the more unpopular stores and you order later in the day, there is a high chance that the meat will no longer be \"good\"...as I learned at 11 years old finding myself with food poisoning and in the ER - green...puke...no bueno...)1. Chicken - Costco-sized-overfed-plump-and-gargantuan-chicken. I loved the flavor...even though I could taste a hint of water in the meat. It's not something I'd complain about. Only slight setback is the ice bath makes the chicken breast a little tougher than it already is in most chicken rice stalls.2. Rice - fluffy, NOT OILY - awesome.3. Soup - you can really taste CHICKEN ESSENCE, which is so different from all the chicken rice spots I've had since I was a child.4. Chicken feet - they DE-BONE the chicken feet, which also ends up in an ice bath. The flavor is rather bland and the taste of water is quite obvious. But I enjoyed the crunchy cartilage texture and definitely used quite a bit of chili sauce to resurrect this dish.5. Vegetables in oyster sauce - meh. Nothing special. If you're going to eat here, just order the chicken and pick up a vegetable from one of the other stores instead.",

On my recent visit, I realized that their rice is not as oily and wet as before. Definitely healthier, but I miss the good old flavorful oily chicken rice. Go before dinner time around 4pm, because there is always a line if you go during dinner or lunch time",

    "text": "If you are into cold chicken, you will probably like this. While I am not a fan of piping hot food and actually prefer my food to be room temperature or warm, I am not into icy cold chicken. Well the chicken felt icy cold to me which was a shock to the system. Now I understood what Jireh H meant by the ice bath in his review. The line was long on a Saturday late afternoon. Seriously, Singaporeans eat at all hours. I waited about 20 minutes which I guessed was not too bad. The uncle would direct you to where to stand to wait for your food, depending on whether you are dining in or taking away. The rice was good, very fragrant with chicken fats. The chicken was tender after you got over the super cold sensation. I liked the sauce which was drizzled over it. A considerably big portion for just $3.50. The soup was tasteless, too diluted. The chili sauce was spicy but not earth shattering. Maybe I preferred mine to be a bit more tart and spicy. It is a good plate of chicken rice but only if you like cold chicken. I usually prefer mine to be of the roasted version so I can eat the crispy skin. Blanched cooked chicken skin is just too slippery and a bit slimy to me.",

    "text": "The good:You always see stingy chicken rice uncles like to use the side of their choppers to flatten the piece of already-very-tiny chicken meat before chopping. But this stall gives good chunks of chicken which very much worth the $3.50. The slight chilled chicken they served me is a good mix of breast and tail portion. The chicken breast is not dry and the tail part not oily. Actually I find their chicken kinda... refreshing. No guilt feeling when I was eating (at least from what I see). Rice is okay, not oily. Service wise, they are efficient. Less than 5 min, I'm already carrying my tray to my seat. But if you are in the queue, that's a different case. I was there at 3pm so no queue ;)Their chicken rice is good but not wow which explains the A-OK stars. Other than the not-stingy portion of chicken, everything else is just A-OK. You didn't miss out a lot if you haven't tried.",

    "text": "After Tian Tian Chicken Rice, I think this must be the stall which will actually require people to queue for more than 30min. We queued for exactly 40min slightly before 5pm on a Sunday afternoon. Why the long queue? Well, this appeared in \"Where the Queue Starts\" and the price is really cheap. We ordered half a chicken ($12), chicken feet ($3), bean sprouts aka taugeh($3). Each plate of rice costs 50cent. What's good: The chicken. Admittedly not as good as kampung chicken but the meat was chilled tender and juicy. A good antidote against the sweltering heat inside the stuffy hawker centre. One won't find chicken hanging at the stall because they are all submerged in cold water before serving (versus hanging upside down at Tian Tian) The knife skills were also considerably above average. \u00a0The rice was not as greasy as Boon Tong Kee but still fragrant especially with sweet soy sauce, though some might find the grains hard. But, the problem for us was the diluted chilli which seemed to be prepared half-heartedly. Old Ma stated that the chilli should be really superb to the extent that one can finish an entire plate of chicken rice without the chicken. \u00a0In short, this place is definitely not the best chicken rice in town. Worth queuing for the price but not for the taste.",

    "text": "Located in Kim San Leng hawker center near Junction 8, Ming Kee Chicken Rice never fails to attract large crowds during meal times. One doesn't need to worry as their service is relatively fast unless there are office workers who are ordering huge takeaways for their colleagues. Personally, I waited for 10 minutes during lunch at 1.00pm and I would estimate that one would be served from anywhere between 10 to 20 minutes during peak periods.Ming Kee chicken rice stall serves steamed chicken only and they do it in the different ways most Singaporean hawkers do. One can have the standard chicken rice and chicken, or order half a / full chickens for sharing. I ordered the standard plate of chicken rice with breast meat and extra rice at $3.30. It is nice to note that they do fulfill one's preferences of chicken parts such as breast meat, thigh meat etc. at no extra charge. Their rice was not oily, while the breast meat was a bit too dry for my taste. However, Ming Kee's chicken rice still stands out from many other chicken rice stalls due to their unique rice texture and flavoring as well as their large sized portion of chicken meat. Lastly, while many Singaporean hawkers rise and fall with their chili sauce, Ming Kee's chili sauce was not spectacular but good enough for one's meal with the chicken rice. This is definitely one of the must try chicken rice outlets in Singapore.",

    "text": "It is quintessential for Singaporeans to be in love with chicken rice. Almost criminal if you claim you're not a fan. As your typical Singaporean I need my chicken rice fix one or twice a month, \u00a0and this busy stall 5 minutes from home is my dealer. For $3.50 to 4.50 for small and big portions, \u00a0these guys are very generous with their chicken portions. Only serving white steamed chicken, \u00a0skin optional, \u00a0this stall has captured my heart with their keen attention to your requests and quality of food. Their chicken comes in juicy chunks that are not flattened, \u00a0the rice not too oily and the soup is just the right amount of salty. Its ironic, \u00a0but I cannot handle spicy food, \u00a0and yes I get that I am Indian but let's not go there. As a result, \u00a0I cannot comment on the quality of their chilli (which Singaporeans love) \u00a0so I guess that, \u00a0you will have to find out about on your own. The only reason this is getting 3 stars instead of 4 is due to the long snaking queues at lunchtime (11am to 2pm) and dinnertime (6 to 8pm) which I am not a fan of. I tend to just head down there at odd hours to beat the line.",

    "text": "I first asked on Twitter about where to go for dinner in Bishan and this place is the most cited location, which is quite surprising since there must be many other good food around. This must be around for a long while too as many have reminisced about having this after School and growing up.So I checked it out on a Friday night. It is located just further away from the bus interchange near the library/community centre and beside the 24-hour Shop N' Save. There is also Koi bubble tea nearby. The \u00a0coffeeshop was really warm and stuffy when we went too even though it was windy outside. We had to wait 30 minutes in the queue because there's 20 people ahead of us, but that's pretty efficient considering its not really fast food.Their chicken meat is the cold type, which I really liked. Overall they have really good chicken rice.",

    "text": "Chicken rice can be found everywhere in Singapore. I doubt there is a single hawker centre or food court here that does not have a stall selling this signature hawker fare. There are many contenders to the crown of best chicken rice in Singapore and Ming Kee at Bishan is definitely one of them.A good chicken rice stall to me is a combination of soft tender chicken, fragrant rice and a solid garlic chilli. And Ming Kee definitely ticks all three boxes and more. To me, the cardinal sin of chicken rice is serving chicken or rice that is cold. No worries of that at Ming Kee though, the rice is always piping hot and fragrant, no oily. The chicken is also warm and succulent. The chicken skin will just slide down your throat and not feel too fatty. The serving is also very generous not like many places these days that give you a few slices of dried chicken with a tiny dollop of rice. The only problem with Ming Kee is its popularity. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the ridiculous queues. You can expect to end up queueing 30 mins for a plate of chicken rice especially during the lunch peak hours. In my book, definitely one of the best if not the best in Singapore. But I dont always feel like queuing so long for it.",

Not wanting to walk around in search of good since I was hungry, I decided to join the queue and sample the chicken rice here.I finally got my chicken rice after around 15 minutes, which was really not too bad, but felt like an eternity for an impatient guy like me.The rice here is really good, because it's oily, fragrant and had the right texture. The chicken here compares very favorably with some of the better chicken rice stalls out there; tender, succulent and the skin is so addictive. I also ordered the chicken feet here, and those tasted really good as well.Honestly, you really cannot go wrong with the chicken rice here. I would probably rate the chicken rice here among one of the better ones that I have ever eaten.",
