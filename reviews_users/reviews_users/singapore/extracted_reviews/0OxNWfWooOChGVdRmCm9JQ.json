The store is very extensive and serves fresh sushi.If you are going for economical, you can try the 10$++ set menu which is good enough for one person. Definitely if you would like to indulge, the chirashi set/don would be most appropriate to satisfy you.I must say the sashimi is well prepared, the freshness is there, the sweetness of fish and it is served in thick slab, not skimpy. Remember to make reservation in advance as it is almost impossible to get a seat as they have some time slot system .",

Very generous with their servings of fish, Huge slabs of salmon, tuna, and other fish. Very fresh and succulent. The sweetness of the fish really comes through. . Their Chawanmushi is also something special. I usually do not really like chawanmushi bit over here, it's full of chunks of chicken, prawns, and mushrooms. If you are not into raw fish, the other sets are also generally very good. The nabe teishoku (codfish and vegetables in claypot) come highly recommended.",

    "text": "So you're likely spoiled for choice for decent Japanese in Singapore where the Japanese dining experience is represented all the way from the likes of Shinji (now closed to my absolute regret), to fast food and ramen bars. \u00a0Chikuwa Tei is somewhere in between. It's a very solidly mid-upper range Japanese bistro whose menu includes a very decent selection of good quality chiraishi don and sashimi-based entrees. \u00a0 The outlet here has a sushi bar and a dining area with tops.I'm no expert, but I do like what I like and what this joint puts out is pretty solid stuff. Definitely hard to fault and for that price point, pretty solid on value too. \u00a0 The fish is fresh, pleasant on the palate, clean to the eye and for me, continues to feel good long after dinner. \u00a0This last is particularly important, as not everything positive gustatory experience at the table lasts. \u00a0Too often the umami that keeps you coming back for mouthfuls and makes for oohs and aahs at the table is the product of the same monosodium glutamate that hours later comes back to smite you with dry mouth, a mild headache and an unquenchable thirst. \u00a0The dining experience at Chikuwa Tei, the one time that I've dined in and the few times that I've gotten take out has been consistent with the flavor of fresh ingredients being forward and allowed to represent themselves without too much gussying up. Overall, one of those solid, consistent Japanese joints that are unlikely to compromise on quality to keep the price point stable. \u00a0At least not till now and I'm keeping my fingers crossed...",

And then the food: I had the chirashi kou, the more expensive chirashi option. With two cubes of soft watermelon and a miso soup, the chirashi bowl was small, and not very generous slices of fish (just two of each): salmon, maguro, scallops sandwiches tightly between lemon slices to mask its staleness, hamachi that was fishy, two sweet shrimp and unagi. Some ikura. The fish was mediocre. The rice was passable but some bits clumpy. And not sufficiently filling. Would never return. Sooner head to sushi bar for a decent bowl of chirashi.Edit: and they charge $0.60 for a glass of water!! They didn't even inform me of that! Disgusting.",

I can't remember the last time I said that about a Japanese restaurant (maybe because it never happened??)Seriously though. I totally could've shared my lunch set and been happy. Heaping plate of fried udon noodles, 5 chunky slices of salmon, miso soup, watermelon - all for $14. Most sets are $15-$20; chirashi starts at $25. Everything was flavored well and delicious.I imagine 2 sets could very comfortably feed 3 people, so share away! Super pleasant atmosphere and service. It's a splurgey kind of lunch, but great ROI ;)",

They also have a premium chirashi bowl and will try definitely try to sell you that, but that one costs 3x the price! I normally only go for the normal one and tell them I only want Salmon, Salmon Belly and Swordfish - my all time favourites when it comes to sashimi. Their rice is so tasty but could be a little bit more. I can't complain coz of the price though. What issit like...$25bucks per bowl? I like their Botan Ibi sashimi too, however it isn't for everyone. What they normally do is make soup out of their heads for you so as not to waste it. And if i'm feeling a bit more generous... I'll order the Steak Fois Gras! OMG. It will BLOW YOUR MIND.Service is friendly... other things on the menu can be a bit pricey like other high end jap places. But of course everywhere is the same - you pay for quality. But if you stick to the items I mentioned, it shouldnt cost more than 60-70 per head eating quality +Quantity items which are bang for buck!Currently, there are many Chirashi Bowl compettion out there but till this day, this place is MOST DEFINITELY the bench mark on terms of quality, quantity and pricing!!P.S - \u00a0Don't be shy to ask for the normal Chirashi Set if you're not so set on splurging on the premium set and feel free to tell them which types of sashimi exactly u only want! :) Salmon Belly is amazingggggg in my books! Oh and one more extremely important point - BETTER make sure to make reservations if you're having dinner there. Lunch seems to be fine though. Don't say I didn't warn you!",

    "text": "One of my favorite Japanese restaurant has got to be Chikuwa Tei, which is located at Mohamed Sultan Road near Robertson Quay. I have been frequenting this restaurant for at least 2 years and it has always provided good food at reasonable prices.There are 18 bento sets to choose from, from S$12 to $25, the most expensive being the Chirashi set. I've tried a couple of their bentos and the quality is pretty consistent.If you like Sashimi, you would love this. Just look at the generous chunks of fresh fish piled on top of the vinegar rice! Each piece is about 10cm long and at least 1cm thick and you can taste the fresh sweetness of the fish. S orders this everytime we go there.Depending on my mood, i would go for Ten Cha Soba set ($12) when i want something lighter. Or their Chikuwa Tei set when i'm really greedy. They have 2 sets, 1 for individual and another for 2pax. It is more pricy (about S$40-50/pax) but there is a variety of dishes, from grilled to tempura and sukiyaki even.Anyway, i love the refreshing cha soba which has a tinge of matcha taste in it (not all cha soba tastes of green tea). The texture of the green noodles is also very spingy and the dipping sauce is of the right amount of saltiness. The California maki (S$8) is also very satisfying. In fact, it's quite a huge portion. The chef is very generous with the avocado and flying fish roe. There is no need for soy sauce because the natural saltiness of the roe is sufficient for flavoring. If you were wondering if it's the same notorious chef from Wasabi Tei at Far East Square, it is (or was). I didn't see him the last time i was there so i'm not sure if they have changed their chef.",

At twice the price of Wasabi Tei's, I must say this barely comes close with the salmon having a slight fishy smell.The ebi maki comes in at the number 2 spot after Wasabi Tei's. Not enough crunch, less prawn and smaller in size, well there you go.Not a bad place to dine in but for better quality sashimi that doesn't break the bank, I still prefer Wasabi Tei.",

We made a reservation a week in advance and reported 15 minutes earlier than our reservation time. There was a long queue when we arrived and we were patient enough to wait outside. However, after 8 and still waiting, we were passed over by groups whom Esmond, the young partner, claimed that they have been waiting for a good time before us. We were understanding about the long wait until he gave our table to a group of Caucasians who walked in a good 45 minutes after us!! We confronted him about his rationale behind this gesture and he claimed that they booked their table a month before and reserved tables for 830. We reserved our table for 8pm and a week early. It is complete bollocks!!! Why should an 8.30pm reservation be seated before an 8pm reservation?!? He proceeded to claim this was a \"real time real world\" problem. I can't see any other problem other than his poor service management skills. Clearly he has a post colonial hang up - choosing to serve a group of non-locals over a group of locals; and a mercenary streak for allowing a group which made a reservation for 5 but showed up for 10 be seated prior to other reservation bookings.",

    "text": "This is currently our favorite casual dining sushi joint. \u00a0We've been probably about a dozen times. \u00a0It's not as crowded, full of expats, expensive or pretentious as many of the the other places on Mohammed Sultan. \u00a0The menu is pretty extensive, and the kids can get teriyaki salmon or chicken dinners or udon while I can get sashimi. \u00a0If you have a slightly larger group (say around 8+), you can use the private room in the back. \u00a0Generally, I like this place.Caveat emptor - do not commit the folly that my husband and I recently did (unless you are a belly tuna afficionado) - blithely nodding when the sushi chef offered us the belly tuna \"just in from Japan.\" \u00a0We were perfectly content with regular maguro and are game to try anything new, but we in fact found the belly tuna too chewy and gamey for our tastes. \u00a0The shocker on the bill was that the four petite slabs set us back by $50.Still looking for that clutch sushi place here in Singapore...",

    "text": "Went on a lunch date with a girl friend. I've been craving sashimi for a few days and was looking forward to the array of options on the Chirashi-bowl. I've tried the restaurant on few other occasions and was happy with the quality of the fish for the rather moderate price. However, I was disappointed with the lunch. It was too obvious that some of the fish had been frozen and tasted a bit like a supermarket's grab-and-go bento box sushi. Three-stars because of its solid record from the past. Hopefully, this was just a one-off incident.",

    "text": "I tried this restaurant on Sunday for lunch. The place is quite small and simple. \u00a0Service is ok. We ordered a Chirashi (25sgd) and a cod fish set (20 sgd).The Sashimi was very fresh and of unexpected generous portions (plus it was ready after just 5 minutes). The cod fish came together with a small salad and was well cooked and tasty. \u00a0Both sets included a miso soup and two slices of watermelon. Overall, a good place for sushi/sashimi with reasonable price.",
