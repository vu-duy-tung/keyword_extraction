They were also extraordinary. Little pouches of deliciousness! Highly recommended.",

It's famous in Singapore, and I was taken here by a local friend.We went at 1pm on a weekday and it was quite busy, both inside, and out (lots of people came for takeaway), so I can only imagine what a weekend would be like. Very fast service, friendly and busy staff bustling around getting the job done, adds to the atmosphere.They only do the wanton noodles, no other dishes (the menu is a single page order form that you fill out and take up and pay) so it's a testament to their longevity. The sauce is quite hot, but I'd still recommend a good glug of it mixed in with your noodles to give it some kick. The boiled wontons were great, whilst the fried ones and the char siew were nothing special. We had the extra greens which were also good.I'd definitely eat here again and would suggest getting the large portion (it's only an extra $1) if you are feeling hungry.",

It really depends on what you look for in your wonton noodles. Some people like the noodles, the roast pork (char siew), or the dumplings (wontons). Unfortunately, I haven't found a place that all aspects of this Cantonese dish right. Singapore-style wonton noodles also differ a bit from HK-style wonton noodles in terms of the sauce. At this place, it's only the noodles that are good. The noodles are different from the regular ones, and are factory-made to Eng's specifications. They are cooked springy and al dente, and firm to the bite, tossed in a generous amount of pork lard.The dumplings are also pretty good, with a generous filling and especially when they are deep fried. For those who like a soy sauce or ketchup concoction to go with their noodles, Eng's only provides a bottle of burning hot capsaicin-overload chilli sauce to go with the noodles. The roast pork (char siew) is generally dry and nothing to shout about. So if you're not a fan of their hot sauce, you'd find the noodles rather plain and boring.I'm somewhere at a 3.5 rating for this place. It's not worth the travel halfway across Singapore to get yourself here to try the noodles, but it is a recommended stop if you happen to be around the area. Again, the usual disclaimers apply.",

    "text": "This is definitely my favorite place for wanton mee in Singapore. Simple menu as they only specialize in this one dish and you can add a couple sides of vegetables and deep fried wantons. I personally prefer the dry version since I'm a slow eater and if it's in soup then the noodles just get soggy. The fresh noodles are nice and chewy and have a slight curl to them which is perfect for the sauce to grab onto. Make sure you give the noodles a quick toss when you get it so it's evenly mixed or the sauce really just sits at the bottom of the bowl. Homemade hot sauce on the table is delicious but it is indeed spicy so add with caution!Don't forget to serve yourself some pickled jalepenos and fried lard as they compliment the dish perfectly. Oh, and get the large!",

If you want top notch service, you won't get it from a place that charges $4-5 per bowl, realistically speaking. You pompous fools.Aside from that, I personally think this is one of the best wanton mee places in Singapore. The noodles are springy and never overcooked, and the char siew is tasty as well. I focus mostly on the noodle texture and overall flavor, and the entire dish is as savory as it can get. I know that it is not tomato / chili-based, but whatever they put into the oil mix is highly addictive to my palate. Definitely a favorite of mine, and will be back for more soon.",

    "text": "Together with with 4 flavorful dumplings, the amount of noodles is pretty filling at $4. While some stalls are better at certain ingredients, say the char siew or noodles, Eng's version pays details to everything.No dark or light soy sauce like Kok Kee, the version here looks just as white as the one from Nam Seng. However, all is not lost. The pork lard that is tossed with the firm egg noodles not only prevent then from clumping and injects another dimension of fragrance. The charsiew have great caramelization with bits of fats. And the super spicy chilli lives up to its name as it is spicy, but in a different way. Because it is purely blended chilli, it tastes bitter. I did not really enjoyed it because it was not appetizing enough like Sambal chilli nor will it make you blow your nose or cause watery eyes like chilli padi. The noodles are simply good without the chilli sauce but no one would stop you from dousing it liberally into the noodles, turning the dish into a sea of orangey yellow (compare this and the top picture). The sauce is definitely bearable for chilli-takers, but I find that the bitterness (not spiciness) robs the original taste of wanton mee when squeezed in excess. We ordered extra wantons to share even though they were the same as those in the noodles. The pinkish pork filling were chewy and meaty.  \u00a0 I am glad that this wanton mee legend has continued in this era. If you haven't try it yet, please do. \u00a0 It is something worth traveling all the way for, over and over again. A taste to remember",

Even though the chilli these days isnt as hot as the original, I'm pretty sure it'll bring out a few drops of sweat while eating.But there is hope for the non-chilli eaters. The sauce comes in a squeeze bottle, so only you can determine how much pain (or gain) you want to put yourself through.Chilli aside, the noodles are great. They're springy with abit of bite and the wantons are really tasty.
