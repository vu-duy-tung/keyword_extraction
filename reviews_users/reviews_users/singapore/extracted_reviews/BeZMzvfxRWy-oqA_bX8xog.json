    "text": "Pita Pan is a great place to grab some food before the nightly light show (you get a good view of the light show from the steps of Marina Bay Sands) or if you're shopping at Marina Bay Sands. I had a really delicious falafel wrap meal here. The meal comes with fries and a drink, but it's a bit expensive. (You're paying for the location, I think -- Marina Bay Sands is a little fancy-pants and touristy.) The falafel balls were flavourful and not at all dry (which can happen with falafels), and the hummus was really enjoyable.Atmosphere-wise, this place is pretty casual...kind of one step up from fast food. It's all Mediterranean-style vegetarian food, but not all-vegan (they have a lot of shakshuka options, which have egg.) They also have a range of pizzas, salads, and platters with dips. It was crowded when I was there (at night) and the air conditioning was frigid (not a bad thing if you've been out walking and sightseeing all day.) Service was a little unfriendly, but they were busy.Definitely worth a stop if you're near Marina Bay Sands and craving some Mediterranean food.",

    "text": "Something different for a change. Decent food.Visited on a weekday, the place was fairly empty. Customers mostly look like tourists who were visiting \u00a0the mall. You have to place your order at the narrow counter area, after paying they would issue you a pager to notify you to pick up when your food is ready.The menu was fairly simple. We ordered the Mediterranean platter to share among three of us and a Green shaksuka to share. Food took approximately 10mins to be ready. I like it that the food are served warm. The serving was fairly decent for the price. The taste was interesting and delicious. A different taste experience vs the usual Chinese/Korean/Jap cuisine. Not sure if such food would appeal to my parents who mostly prefer Asian food. Overall, decent food with slightly above average price tags.",

The unit is small with about 10 inside tables and 5 outside. The outside seating provides a nice view of the ArtScience Museum and the boardwalk. Although it is a fast and casual place, the dishes are still around $15, likely due to its location.I tried the red shakshuka, which is similar to a skillet of pasta sauce with two eggs inside and a pita on the side. Basically, you can put the sauce onto or into the pita. It was quite tasty and I would eat it again. I also recommend the falafel balls.",

    "text": "Had a business meeting around the Marina Bay Sands area thus decided to wander around to check out the food here. Was introduced to Pita Pan by my lunch buddy for the day for it's easy to consume Pita that's served the Subway style.First you go to the counter to order what you'll like to have. Decided to go for the simple and easy to manage Pita Set. Went for the half set which is served with 3 falafel instead of the full set which has 5 falafel. Besides the Pita, the set comes with a drink and an order of fries. For those who are here for the first time, I recommend that you top up the set with an additional $2 to change the normal fries to the sweet potato fries. It's a interesting texture and of course, slightly sweeter than regular fries. Upon finishing your order, take a seat at your table and they will call your number, which was issued to you when you paid for the food, when they are ready to serve you. When called, proceed to the \"salad\" counter and you'll get to choose what you'll like to put into your Pita from the selection of vegetable and sides available at the counter. The hummus is a staple in all pitas and it's really good! There's no limit to how many ingredients you can add to the pita and the last choice to round up the pita is the sauce, of which you have four flavours to select from.The food tastes not too bad. The portion is sufficient for me. However, I dont quite agree with having to pay for service charge when there is hardly any table service. Note that the price quoted on their menu boards are before GST and service charge. So even though the Half Pita set was decently priced at $7.90 on the menu board, it came up to about $9ish after taxes. I'm happy to pay the GST but it doesnt seem right to include service charge when I am mostly self serving and besides some ala carte dishes where they are served to table from kitchen, all the ordering and payment are done self service.Do try and it'll be great to hear how you feel about paying service charge!",

And why is there an extra charge for sundried tomato falafel when the menu doesn't indicate so? All of this brought my full pocket sandwich, which was listed as $10.90 to $14.01.Don't get me wrong, I love Pita Pan. I really do, and i kept coming back here despite their dodgy \"hidden charges\". It's still decently priced for its location, but i just wish they are more up front about it.The food is good. I love the pita pockets, where you can choose your own (healthy!) ingredients and add your own sauces. Sundried tomato falafel is tasty. The red and green shakshouka are both really yummy as well, served piping hot.I just wish they would solve the odd hidden charges already!!!",

    "text": "Came to Pita Pan, a Mediterranean bistro which offers salad, falafel and hearty Middle-East/Lebanese stews because I was craving for hummus. Pita Pan sounds like Peter Pan to me but it's not any happy fairyland restaurant. It was the poor service which ruined what could be a more pleasant experience.This is less like a restaurant at MBS and more like a fast food outlet as diners have to find their own seats and order from the counter (no signs stating that it was self-service). What was more hilarious was the servers at the salad counter told us to order at the cashier, but yet the cashier had been ignoring us as she was busy counting the cash.What can we do but wait before they were ready to key in our orders? The HALF-POCKET SANDWICH ($7.90), was assembled gradually like a subway sandwich. First, half a pita bread was filled with three chickpea falafel. Then, pick all-you-want from the salad counter ( I chose nearly everything), and lastly the dressing (I opted for the tahini dressing also known as sesame paste).The end result looked totally different from the menu but was very delicious, especially the golden-brown falafels. They had a crispy coating but were not too dry inside.Instead of the Middle Eastern breakfasts, we had the Hummus with Mushrooms served with pita bread ($11.90). The bread version here was warm, soft and fluffy. The hummus here was better than Onaka's version because they are not chilled nor too salty. It was extra creamy with generous amount of mushroom toppings. Not quite sure how healthy this was but my tummy was satisfied!Conclusion: Service aside, food was not too bad and portions are quite substantial. Unless they fine-tune the service here, I don't think eating here is any beneficial, especially for our mental health. For those who wish to check this out, bring your own water as they don't serve it.",

Of course, like all kiasu Singaporeans, I also did some pre-reading on HGW. Bad/horrendous/rude service featured quite frequently - ok, I get it! We had the Red Shakshuka, Mediterranean Platter, extra pita and sweet potato fries. Food was not bad, to be honest. Fresh, aromatic and stuffed chockfull with corriander, the quality was definitely up there and PP is worth a couple of revisits, just to explore the extensive menu. Service was brusque, but not terrible. Perhaps from what I'd read, I'd expected surly servers to give me lip. Maybe I just had the worst in mind, which tempered the entire experience. Tables are packed very close to each other, and it's a pain to suck in your tummy and try to squeeze past. Especially if you've just eaten a load of chickpeas (beans!); not a good idea. If you're getting a platter to share, you'll definitely need more pita to sop the runny stuff up with. This isn't exactly a budget or high end joint, and while the price isn't hefty, it's also a bit more than I expected.",
