    "text": "I chanced upon Todai on the internet, with its outlandish claim of being the mother of all seafood buffets, I thought it be nice to get my family together for an early Mother's day treat. I rushed to the seafood and waited patiently in line for my turn. After getting all the required seafood I wanted, I sat down and let the sashimi slide down my throat. Sad to say, the salmon or tuna wasn't any great, and I would say it for the rest of the seafood as well - that it tastes just like any other average buffet lines in Singapore, which kinda ruined my evening even before trying the rest of the stuff. However, it's safe to say that Todai does have some pretty good escargot. The western food selection is pretty unique, and the pastries has some of the most wonderful stuff. In any case, have a look at some pictures and make your decision thereafter.",

    "text": "Todai is a Korean-owned restaurant chain offering sushi and seafood. It prides itself as a seafood buffet. It is located at Marina Bay Sands (Shoppes side). Fret not, it's not as upclass as the celebrity restaurants in the vicinity. Actually, i would put it in the category as your regular 3-4* hotel buffets. There is quite a selection for the buffet: Salads & Cold Cuts, Sushi & Sashimi, Noodles, Italian Pizza & Pasta, Meat & Seafood, Brazilian Churassco, Korean treats, Desserts and More! Snow Crab claws and freshly shucked oysters are available too but it depends on which day of the week it is. :( Then again, i wasn't impressed with the snow crabs when i ate it the last time because they weren't sweet, that kinda mean that they aren't very fresh either. There is a small selection of breads and cheeses but they weren't spectacular. The Hot food section is quite extensive with a mix of Chinese and Western dishes, baked, grilled, roasted, stir fried etc. I loved the tempura prawns and i thought they were way better than the sashimi.Being korean owned, there were the representative korean dishes but they aren't comparable to those you get at the restaurants. They were mainly side dishes like kimchi and anchovies. Quite disappointing for a seafood buffet. I think The Line does it better for the same price.",

    "text": "Many people often ask,\"What is the last meal you want to have before you die?\" A more meaningful question would be \"What is the dish you want to eat on your birthday?\"In conjunction with their 4th anniversary in Singapore, Todai presents an array of birthday dishes from mainly China, Korea Russia. I was surprised that Longevity Bun and Yi Mien Noodles are served instead of mian xian (vermicelli) and red eggs because the former are usually eaten to celebrate the birthdays of elderly people. It might be good to bring the pioneer generation here to try the promotion.Out of the 7 birthday dishes, the Korean representative, Jap Chae, is the most deftly executed dish as the glassy sweet potato noodles were chewy and not clumpy. Stir fried in black fungus and egg crepe, the noodles released a very fragrant sesame aroma without being overly sweet. It marries well with the Miyeokguk, a seaweed soup that is rich with iodine and calcium. It is my first time trying African dishes like the Jollof Rice from Nigeria and Oto from Ghana. Perhaps due to the air-con, the dish became stodgy lumps of tomato rice that seemed unevenly mixed. A pity because the enticing mixture of coconut oil, fresh red pepper and spice blend suggested a high potential dish. Eggs symbolized purity and fruitfulness and this egg-mash of yam and oil might not struck one in awe instantly but is still quite a unique dish worth a try. Did you know that the \"rainbow\" cake originated from Russia? Deck in strong neon colours, the buttercream frosted sponge cake is fairly average and doesn't impress as much as the pillowy Green Tea Chiffon Cake, which is the better dessert out of the mediocre crop. Just like the rest of the desserts, the seafood and sushi did not taste as fresh or interesting even though efforts are put in to make them as creative as possible. A disappointment as Todai started out as sushi and seafood restaurant in California in 1985.After tasting most all the dishes, I realized that our favourites come from the Korean Section. The grilled pork and beef were cooked to the right degree with well-controlled seasoning. What piqued my interest was this Acorn Jelly, a gelatinous square that tasted like seaweed with the special korean chilli dressing. There is also a delicious variety of bancai (side dishes) to go along with the steamed rice. In case you are not sure where to start from, head to the Korean section if \"quality\" is the thing you pursue instead of \"quantity\".",

    "text": "I was vaguely excited at the prospect of Todai. Seafood buffet. Oysters (on weekends), crabs, prawns, it was a long list of delicious sounding food.Firstly, they put out oysters in very limited amounts, probably to control costs.Secondly, they shuck the oysters, and leave them soaking in water while waiting to push out the next batch.I'm sorry, but WHO THE F... uh HELL SOAKS OYSTERS IN WATER before serving them! You lose all the 'liquor'. I mean seriously. Just. Urgh.There were a good variety of crabs, Alaskan, Hairy, and Red. The King Crabs were very good, though a little salty, but the sweetness of the meat offered good balance.There was this ginseng chicken soup that everyone was rushing for, but it was just... MEH. Mini-abalone and young ginseng in the soup must've been the main draws because the taste definitely wasn't that impressive.Cooked items were mediocre, on that day there was maybe... one or two cooked items that were good, the Korean pancakes were decent, the sushi and sashimi really weren't anything better than what you'd get at Ikoi or Irodori, and in fact, the sushi was probably worse. Urgh. The staff are also very bad at keeping plates filled. When we walked it there were 6-8 dishes sitting empty, and there was never actually a moment when I didn't see one dish plaintively empty.Considering the cost of the entire experience, I really really wouldn't go back. It's just incredibly mediocre, and poor value... for me.If you're a crab fan, and go there and basically GORGE yourself on crabs, I think you could make it work.",

    "text": "Todai also features signature dishes that are served year round, from snow crab legs to green mussels to cocktail shrimps. I love their crayfish but they only limit to 2 per person each time you queue. The snow crab legs is fresh and sweet. Plus there is a wide variety of selection of food in Todai which attract so many customers. I had to say, i'm upset and frustrated with the service there. The service is one of the lousiest i have been to. Waiters do not clear up my plates. I even have to ask them nicely to clear off my plates as there is not enough space to put anymore new dish. Even after several time of asking, they still did not show their professional attitude in dealing with the matter. For the amount of price spent, i dont think think Todai is worth my try of going back again. The service greatly affected my dining experience over there.",

    "text": "Located at the basement level of Marina Bay Sands Shoppes, many would mistake Todai for an upscale restaurant that is totally out of their reach price-wise. But on a weekday afternoon, buffet price for adults is only about $42++. But my favourite part is how they consider 'child - sized portions' to be anybody below 1.3 metres tall. This is a lot better in terms of fairness since I've seen some kids that at 11 can clear several plates of food!Todai is a Korean seafood buffet restaurant that serves both Korean style items as well as International Buffet items. They not only serve items like kimchi, but also Korean savoury pancakes, bulgolgi beef and chicken, and even bbq pork belly which is usually not seen at international buffets. There is a also section where you can order different types of pastas cooked in your specific sauces and style, and pizzas as well. They have a huge dessert area with at least 10 different cakes at all times - my favourite part of the whole meal.",
