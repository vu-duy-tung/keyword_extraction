Coming from California, I've never had es cendol taste so legit and like pandan than when I came here. The es cendol here was the perfect blend of sugar, coconut milk and pandan jelly noodles. The bowl that you could eat from was a chalice of perfection from which you could double soup spoon all of its glory into your body at the same time. It was the perfect dessert to have on a hot day, and after walking around for hours outside.",

I feel thirsty and crave salty food after eating here.There is one specific dish I keep on returning for: the mussels. Not the mussels on the regular menu, the mussels they sell on the stall outside. You can ask them to put them on a dish and enjoy them together with your other choices.Oh and it is also dirt cheap, me and my friends always stuff ourselves and never manage to spend more than 30$ a person, including a 650 ml Thai beer each.So Diandin Leluk is a pretty good deal, I only wish they used less MSG.",

It's a bit seedy by Singapore standards, but I like it! I felt like I stepped back in time and that I was actually in Thailand.I ordered the small portion of the basil chicken for $6. It was really spicy and well-portioned for the price. It was spicy enough that I needed to order 2 Thai iced teas!The reason I leave this at 3 is because I have a sneaking suspicion that my basil chicken had a lot of MSG in it*. My body reacts very strongly to MSG; in addition to feeling extremely dehydrated, I also feel like I'm wide awake and have trouble falling asleep, which is what happened to me after eating here. Because of this, I'm not too inclined to return so soon. :( Maybe I'll just have some Thai iced teas?--*I've noticed that I've only experienced these side effects after dining at Thai establishments in SG, not so much Chinese. I can say that so far, the most legit Thai place here that most likely doesn't use MSG is Jane Thai in Orchard Towers.",

But since my friend works in the area, she has tried most of the restaurants and found this one to be the best.Went there one night and over ordered as usual (a consistent trend when I have Thai meals). The Phad Thai that I had was very authentic. Sweet and sour, this phad thai was also rather moist and contained more prawns that I had expected (more than five). Note that the peanuts come in a separate container so you can choose how much you wish to add to your dish. The Tom Yam Soup was a fiery concoction, which was unfortunate as my spicy tolerance is rather meek. Still, I managed to gulp down a few mouthfuls which I felt was quite salty. Best tried with a glass of iced Thai milk tea by your side. Tried a bit of my friend's fried vermicelli and it was good - tasted completely different from the phad thai even though it seems to be cooked with the same ingredients. Instead of sweet and sour, the vermicelli was more aromatic because of the dark soya sauce added to it. I might order this in the future. We decided to order a few sides - fried crab/fish balls and something none of us had tried before - minced chicken and prawn paste with a salted egg core. The picture of the second dish had looked quite promising. But... it tasted exactly the same as the crab/fish balls. The salted egg yolk taste was not strong at all. All in all, a decent place for Thai food. Writing about it has made me hungry for more Thai food!",

Lunch and dinner times always has the restaurant packed out with Thais, which is obviously a good sign. The foods rather authentic in technique and flavor, though the menu is large, it lacks a little bit of imagination and just lists and array of well-known Thai staples. Nevertheless, the Pad Thai is very good, and good value for money considering the amount of decent quality prawns that are packed into this. Service is sufficient for the sorta money you'll fork out in this place. Desserts shouldn't be skipped here, and nothing beats an icy and refreshing bowl of their Thai red ruby to finish a meal here. Been here at least a dozen times, not the sort of place I'd go to looking for an amazing gourmet feast, though straight forward consistent Thai food.",

Some of the other classic choices are Green Curry and Thai Fish Cakes. I haven't tried a lot on the menu since I usually order the same things, but everything I've seen there looks pretty good. It's definitely worth the trip to Golden Mile, especially when compared to the choice of lackluster Thai establishments you find in the shopping malls.",
