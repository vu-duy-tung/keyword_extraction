The French may be half-baked, but the bread and cakes are freshly baked, and what's not sold at the end of the day is given to charities. Sandwiches are good, service is warm and friendly, and prices are very reasonable. But in these days of intense consumerist competition, you must be a real nostalgic to come to this non-aircon place with furniture that is more charming than aesthetic or comfortable. For the food is good, but not sufficiently unique. The owner's talent and dedication may be better served elsewhere, with bolder ambitions.",

The crust is chewy while the center is really soft my fingers can go through it holding the sandwich. It's not a stable construction and a bit hard to eat. The bacon was well down to the point that my brain was shaking when it was crunching in my mouth. There's also avocado which is a nice touch I think. It's just not what it could be imo. On the espresso, it's pretty bad. I'll have to try the desserts some other time but to go because I like my desserts with a decent coffee.",

    "text": "Very disappointed! \u00a0We ordered 1 supreme Vegetarian, 1 Smoked Salmon, 2 Cranberry Scones, coffee and tea. In the description for both sandwiches, they included cream cheese. The problem is they just lightly touched the tip of the knife on the bread with cream cheese. When we asked for more cream cheese, they brought a saucer with cream cheese as much as the tip of a finger - it was more like an insult than more cream cheese. My wife asked for more cream cheese and offered to pay for it, and we did. When you charge $19+ for a sandwich and you show much stinginess with all ingredients (not just cream cheese but all ingredients) and additionally, you don't respect your customers, it doesn't make for a great experience for them, does it?Cranberry scones came warm with \u00a0butter and jam. They were ok but don't go out of your way for it. Earl grey tea was not aromatic. They don't serve decaf coffee.Ambiance is nothing special. And service was disappointing as noted.Breads were baked fresh. So, if you want to go there and pick up bread, it is ok. I will not go back for food.I will add a picture of cream cheese on the bread sandwich for your reference.",

Sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking.In terms of sandwiches, my favorite is still BLT with extra hard-boiled egg.Had their lunch set today and the soup du jour was disappointing. It was homemade pumpkin soup alright, but I suspect all they did was puree the pumpkin and nothing more. There was not much taste to this soup at all...Still my favorite brunch place in the area!",

    "text": "I have a hard time deciding. Simply too many choices with a limited gastro-capacity. How much can you stomach each day? After all, I am no Adam Richman of Man vs Food who is all out to conquer the most compelling food that keeps populating without any sign of slowing down. The food scene is getting more electrifying and when it becomes explosive, it will be unimaginable. Positively yet, I enjoy the random pick.For 3 years now, it seems to me that there are new breakfast parlors & coffee joints opening every month. All-day-breakfast and coffee tasting (surpassing wine tasting these days) becomes suddenly fashionable. Many are made to rediscover the art of coffee drinking and cultivate the new societal norm of brunching. No one could be spared.While some are untroubled by queues, others like myself, gets irk by it. Those that comes with a long line, therefore needs either entice me with real stuff or delude me with some marketing gimmicks which I may fall trap at times. With a bit of luck, one could still find authentic flavourful eatery without having to join the crowd in the bustling street of Orchard - but allow me to echo; \"that's when you are in luck.\" Betting at it, I seek out the less congested spot in downtown. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Nestling along a quieter lane at Killiney road, this 5 year old deli-bakery shop is a stone away from the signature kaya toast at Killiney Kopitiam. I remembered savouring the optional coconutty kaya jam & that slightly salted slab of butter that cuddle 2 slices of warm French toast and washed down with a cup of old-fashion brewed coffee. And today, I met with Freshly Baked by Le Bijoux for a similar nostalgia experience - no queue absolutely.I enjoyed its unpretentious makeup with sturdy wooden dining furnitures, withholding some traditional elements. The well-ventilated shophouse is most welcoming. But more inviting is the lady behind the baking countertop who was once the executive pastry chef at Saint Pierre who struck out on her 5 years ago. This baker - Audrey has tempt patrons with her homemade sweet cinnamon loaf, butter cake, walnut raisin bread. Some make their way there for the affordable breakfast sets (nett prices). I hear them, and so I turn up.I was greeted with a firm but friendly tone, the moment I stepped into the shop. The place was empty at 2pm on a Saturday. I quickly pick up the menu placed in an acrylic holder against the wall. Without delay, I went up to the payment counter to make my order and pay for them. The cake choices in the glass shelving were narrow - forget about having any fanciful slices, Audrey bakes traditional confections.The burger bap (Brunch B - S$9.50) arrived with a loud bang. The sizeable bun came with an authentic softness with an easy to chew texture and airy interior, nothing more. The salt-cured beef slices didn't taste too briny but a little too greasy. Instead of assembling them into a \u00e0 la mode burger, I forked the sunny side-up and get excited watching the yolk exploding in all direction atop the bap. The result was a moist and eggy bread combo. Unimpressed, the baked bean stood motionless on the plate. Though it didn't wow me greatly, I appreciate the homely bread offered.2 slices of thick wholemeal bread helped fix one's hunger pangs. I feel the crust crackling apart as it revealed large to medium air pockets in the crumbs. I figured that I tasted too many well-baked European breads these days that the ones I had here failed to surprise me further. The set (Brunch A - S$10.90) came with some crisp bacon strips and a pool of moist but bland scrambled egg. The stalk of romaine looked out of place on the plate; too little to call it salad, too bulky on its own - I don't understand. Still, I am pleased by the customer-oriented gesture here. I feel good not for the cappuccino but the biding good-bye when you make your exit to the door.Next time if you are walking down the Killiney lane with a sudden crave for a homemade loaf, Freshly Baked could be your antidote. Unless you are too starved to walk, the brunch could be your saviour. But I will not succumb to any hunger beast to eat my fill, I wouldn't mind dragging my feet a few inches away. With bountiful options, I feel indebted to EDB and have to praise them for shaping Singapore's economy which includes the food industry, even if they are not the only invisible hand behind it.",

    "text": "Freshly Baked does a good quality brunch at a central but yet low key location and at a ridiculously reasonable price. The Bakery Cafe has been opened since late 2007 and it offers a variety of Artisan Breads, cakes and pastries. What is really good here is their breads. They are so addictive; they were all i could think about after dining here the first time. I just wanna eat bread all my life if they were this good.Sandwiches, breads and cakes are available all day (till they run out and they do run out fast). There are 3 Brunch Sets (S$10.90-12.90). \u00a0but i'm not sure what time they end. The most popular order is the deli corned beef from Huber's Butchery paired with baked beans, a fried egg and burger bag bread. While i was there, i tried the Fresh deli Salami served with Emmental cheese, scrambled eggs and olive oil bread (S$12.90).Even though the scrambled egg was more like omelette (and a little bland), the bread was faultless. It's kinda like an English muffin with the slightly rough exterior but it's moist and dense on the inside and yet it still maintains the slightly fluffiness. I suppose the salami is also from Huber's. I tried stuffing all the ingredients into the bun but failed because there's too much of everything (not complaining)!Great place for brunch or a snack.",

This quaint bakery-caf\u00e9 has a French-style kopitiam set up, along with the aromatic whiffs of freshly baked bread, cakes and pastries from the kitchen allows customers to immediately find comfort in. This place is best for late morning brunches or afternoon tea. Attracting throngs of office folk, many grab lunch on the go, opting for the gourmet sandwiches and gourmet cakes. Alongside the display counter loaded with freshly baked bread, cakes and cookies, is chirpy and welcoming staff, effectively catching the attention of bystanders. Items here are also great for value, as you get great satisfaction at such low prices. Macarons are reasonably priced at $1.50 each and muffins at $1.80 each. You will be immensely surprised to find that all their baked produce have a special homemade flavor that can be difficult to find in commercial cafes out there. I will definitely make this bakery-caf\u00e9 a regular eating haunt.",

    "text": "The four star rating is mostly for their cranberry scones. One huge one for $2.80! A steal. Mom and I popped by after lunch and were pondering what bread/cake to get.. and bing! Mom's brainwave - cranberry scone. I guess the fact that the family before us also ordered it confirmed that it was a good idea. Anyway, it didn't taste super rich (although, I have no idea about the actual butter content, haha) and was slightly spongey, chockful of cranberries, nice touch of caramelized sugar in the middle of the top, and good crust! One of my favourite scones in Singapore so far :) Although granted, I haven't had that many.. Next to try will be the huge ones from Gastronomia Da Paolo. Bf and I tried their chocolate salted caramel tart previously, that was so-so though. I was expecting a crispier/crunchier tart base but this one was soft. I like my buttery tart bases so this one didn't quite cut it. The crunchy choc balls on top added nice texture though! Also, bf's complaint was that there wasn't v much salted caramel (which is true). It was very rich and gooey with choc/caramel filling though.",

I chose to pass the bread at that moment because I was already getting too many other things, but luck of all luck I finally got to taste it later on and my god this is HEAVENLY. It's chocolatey, but not too rich and has a fantastic cake like texture - you could eat this all day and not get sick of it! highly recommended!Giant Cookie:it's face size seriously, nice if you like your cookies crunchy and not so rich. So so for me, I like the pepperidge farm type of soft baked cookies better.Crunchy Chocolate Salted Caramel Tart:The name is a mouthful, but thankfully the tart is not that small! It's a sinfully lovely combination of gooey chocolate with salted caramel and topped off with crunchy chocolate balls in a tart shell. Verdict? AWESOME - for the chocolate lovers!",

My personal favourite, the Veggie Supreme, consists of arugula, avocado and a cheese spread sandwiched between hearty slices of multi-grain bread.I top it off with some black coffee (tastes average) or an unsweetened iced tea on slightly hotter days. In total a meal including a drink costs from $10-$12. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It can get more crowded when the lunch crowd comes, but if you avoid going between 12-2pm on weekdays, it's quite empty.",
