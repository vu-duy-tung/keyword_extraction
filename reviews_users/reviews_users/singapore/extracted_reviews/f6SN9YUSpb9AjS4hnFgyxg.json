Conveniently located and wonderfully furnished, you almost feel like in you're in Paris, thanks to the ambience and service afforded. Perfect for either lunch or dinner with friends or on a date, the steaks on offer are tender and juicy and proof that wagyu isn't the only choice when it comes to having grilled meat. The appetizers are very French, with a variety of escargots, pate's and terrines on offer so you might want to give that a miss if they aren't very familiar to you.",

Probably a one off experience here but thought it worth sharing. We were initially moved to a different table after being seated for about five minutes so they could make space for a larger party. Then after orders were taken have been promptly forgotten by the wait staff, three other tables that arrived after us were served full meals while we weren't even given bread and now I guess they have forgotten about our meal because steaks still aren't here while other tables have been served! Frustrating!",

    "text": "A great place for steak and fries, highly recommended for a chill dinner with friends. It is located among the shophouses at the duxton area, so do keep an eye out or you might miss it. Inside, it has this unique ambiance which kinda feel like those french bistro. The staff were all warm and cheerful which I do really appreciate (it's becoming uncommon these days). The menu is simplistic, with some chouce of appetisers, desserts and beverages to go along and the steak and fries as the main highlight. I had the onion soup which was sweet and fragrant (liked it very much). The steak and fries were also great with great attention paid to the doneness of the steak. Most restaurants tend to serve the steak in one slab and that's it, leaving you with uneven doneness. Here, they took a different approach and instead separated it into 3 servings, ensuring perfect doneness as per requested and you would get warm food throughout the meal. The sauce was rich without being too overpowering. Perhaps it is also good to note that the fries are free-flow, though i found the initial serving was already very generous (But hey, fries is love fries is life). Overall, this is a highly recommended place for steaks if you happen to be in the area. An advice that i would give to fellow readers (and a suggestion to the restaurant perhaps) is to avoid coming in at peak dinner time since the place is really cramped and gets rather echoey when crowded.",

You get a piece of beef which you select if you want Rare, medium rare or well done, they write the selection on the table and shortly you receive your meal. Salad with walnuts and dressing, then the beef and all you can eat fries. Everytime I have gone, they also serve a mini glass of the house wine. This Bistro also has dessert options and appetizers. We have tried their cheese appetizer, which was amazing (if you love cheese ^_^)If you have a craving for a simple yet fullfilling dish, stop by the restaurant in Tanjong Pagar. it is also on a cute cobblestone alley.",

We weren't looking for French, but L'Entrec\u00f4te Bistro on Duxton Hill was open. It's basically 1 restaurant split into two next to each other but with different menus. We chose the Annex. The food was excellent. My Oven Baked Bone Marrow with Gu\u00e9rande sea salt and grilled buttered Poil\u00e2ne bread satisfied my months long craving! I basically licked and sucked that bone LOL. A friend ordered sardines and it was served in its tin...very cute.I also ate 2 fresh shucked oysters from Ireland, then stuffed myself with a perfectly cooked medium rare entrec\u00f4te steak served wth French fries and walnut green salad. I don't recall the French wine we had, and they have a beautiful modern wine cellar to house their stock. Our waiters were nice and friendly.It was really a great, relaxing evening after so much hustle and bustle around Singapore.",

The sauce on the steak was good however I would've preferred it on the side as I like medium-rare with just a bit of salt best. The meat was ok but I have had better, especially for the price (32,50 S$), but that's S'pore.For dessert I chose a tarte tatin which would have scared a French person off as it was huge, with a tarte being normally flat, and the base was very heavy shortbread. It tasted nice though and the sour cream that came with it was perfect.Staff was very friendly and service oriented - we would come back to try their Saturday brunch, but not necessarily for dinner as it is rather expensive, in general, especially when there are so many great \"local\" places to explore.",

I have to say I don't love the steak and fries, especially the half-rate sauce. Free flow fries don't appeal to me, because I don't love fries, and the first portion was way too much for me. The salad that came with the steak had a dressing that had too much vinegar for my taste. When it comes to my salad dressing, I guess less is more for me.So me and a girlfriend had:Homemade Duck Foie Gras TerrineOven Baked Beef MarrowSteak and fries x 2Profiteroles to shareThe terrine was horrible, and it was mostly butter, so avoid it if you come here. The beef marrow was out-of-this-world, and I wish they'd offer a jumbo portion of it. It's just beef bones cut into two with melting marrow inside, to spread on bread. Terribly sinful, but so simple, and so delicious. Our dessert - profiteroles, were drenched in chocolate syrup and ice cream; pretty standard fare and an easy combination that can't go wrong.Would I come here again? Probably not. It wasn't exactly cheap, and there are a few places that do steak better than this.",

Some signature to look out for, escargots for appetisers and the caramel cake with vanilla ice cream for desserts. The caramel cake is like the caramel version of the chocolate lava cake with the caramel oozing from the centre upon cutting.Great atmosphere, nice service.

To start, we waited over 30 min for a table inside (which wasn't too bad as we were enjoying some lovely wine in their patio) when we finally signaled the hostess and asked what was taking so long she promptly ushered us inside and gave us a dinner menu which consisted of 1 item....steak and fries. Being a steak lover I was overjoyed and ordered the steak and decided on the escargot as an appetizer. The escargot were absolutely divine....and the wine was magnificent! The main course when it arrived looked good although a bit watery. It was perfectly done to my likeness but that was it....the flavor and sauce were a huge disappointment :(I couldn't understand what all the hype with the steaks was about!!!! The sauce was watery and to be quite honest not very well done which was a shame because it ruined the great cut of meat. It was a complete waste! It was as if they were trying to mask the flavor of the actual meat by loading it on with a strong green runny sauce. When paying premium price for a steak at a high end restaurant, the expectation is to get a juicy melt in your mouth succulent piece of meat full of flavor but here it was just meat slathered with runny sauce. See a well done steak on its own doesn't even need any sauce let alone be smothered in one. Overall, the ambiance is nice, the place is clean (although a bit too crowded...not enough room and too many tables) the wine and appetizers are great but if you're looking for a good steak...your better off making it yourself at home for a fraction of the price.",

They seated us... then reseated us when a larger group needed our section. I didn't mind, however it took almost 15-minutes for a waitress to appear to take our order and after that it's as if we were forgotten. Three other tables seated after us were served their salad, appetizer and then entr\u00e9e and we hadn't even gotten our salads. 20-minutes and nothing before finally the manager seemed to notice and had two dry salads delivered, no dressing on them. We finished and again the waiting game began, this time they took our salads and after 10-minutes of nothing... came back with two more dry salads! We'd been waiting over 40-minutes and hadn't gotten an appetizers! Most of the tables seated after us had departed and by the time we got the main course we were thoroughly annoyed. The staff never explained why our order was delayed, never apologized... then never even spoke to us other than to nod and then dash off. I've worked as a waiter for several years, in both private & 5-star dining and found the entire staff to be seriously under-trained, under-staffed, the food mediocre and the bill to be far too high for how little the place had to offer. I would not recommend this place to my friends and would actively advise people to avoid it.",

    "text": "We had high expectations when we went there lately. Food was okay but nothing special from our point of view, just ok. The service lacks some friendliness and the personal touch. The location is of course nice but inside, the tables are placed to close to each other. For a romantic dinner probably not the best precondition. Overall ok but there are many other places I would try first before coming back.",
