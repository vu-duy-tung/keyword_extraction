There are so many things I want to taste here but haven't yet because I need to fit into my bridesmaid dress in 2 months and I have to pace myself. Provence is famous for their fluffy wassants. Yes, they're soft and fluffy, but I personally think they kinda lack in flavor? They just tasted like soft plain bread to me. The milk pan, though, was another story. Yummmm milk pan!! The softness, light fragrance, and creamy custard fillings.. one milk pan is really not enough!Even if you're watching your figure, go get their milk pans! Note: i think the address listed on yelp is the old address, they've recently re-opened at raffles holland v.",

The red bean paste itself is not that sweet though, which is great. It's good but a bit too sweet for me overall.Cinnamon coffee bun ($1.80) - 3 starsAlso too sweet - my bad for picking the buns with sugar! The filling tasted buttery and had a coffee flavor, sorta like a roti bun.",

    "text": "Provence is a cute little bakery in Holland Village. Although it's a French name, it's a Japanese inspired bakery with lots of interesting kinds of bread here. The best thing is the wassants here. Its so amazing. They are like tiny little crossaints but a completely different taste and flavor. Its soft, sweet and light and they have custard or chocolate flavor. Hard to explain unless you try it, but its very very good. I also like their prepared sandwiches here. You can come and sit at the caf\u00e9 and they also have a nice balcony area where you can grab a cup of coffee and watch Holland Village go by.",

    "text": "The truth of the matter is, I'm not very much of a pastry kind of guy. I've always heard the females in my life talking about the delicious Japanese styled cofectionary delights that come from Provence Cafe & Bakery so I decided to step in for a look and a taste. I must say, the milk bun that they sell was really good. It has a nice light fluffiness to it and isn't too rich. You can go through a couple of these before realizing that you've had too much. Goes great with a cup of cold milk or a cup of coffee. I've since come up with the idea of getting up in the morning and going there to pick up some of those milk buns, brewing a cup of coffee and enjoying breakfast in a park watching the world go by before my day starts but I've never been able to get up early enough to have a leisurely morning like that! Certain items sell out fast there so you might have to wait for a new batch to be baked.",

    "text": "So here is the problem I have with coffee in Sigapore. Ask for an espresso which comes in a cup for a long black or cappuccino. So of course it hardly lines the bottom and goes cold fast. The coffee it's self was not too bad and at $2.80 what do you expect. \u00a0This place looks cool and has potential. There is however nothing French at all about it as the name may mistakenly lead you to expect. Nice vie form 2nd floor was the highlight and a nice place to read. Shame. I left . Dissapointed. Not the worst place so I gave it a 2nd star but that is all.",

The variety of bread displayed is also unlike the plethora of floss buns and cream sticks or whatever we've become so used to seeing. My favourite is definitely the wassants: light, fluffy, and best of all, cheap! It's very tempting to just buy a dozen of those and gobble them up.I've never tried the drinks from their cafe, but am making it a point to do so soon.",

    "text": "Provence is what a bakery should be - the moment you step in, the aroma fills you with joy, the bread await you with golden smiles and your brain goes \"Bread is healthy right? What diet?! Wha..\"... Tadaaa! You decide to live in the shop forever. Okay, I exaggerate. But Provence - a Japanese-styled bakery with an apparently French name, does hand-made bread very well. The fluffy ones are soft and fluffy, the sweet ones are melt-in-your-mouth. My favourites include:- Brazilian Cheese Bun - This small and round unassuming bun is *toing*toing* chewy and fragrant with every bite.- Cinnamon Bun - I wish this was a sofa, so I can lie in the warm and sugary sweetness of it all. There is NO resisting this bun.- Custard Bun - My colleague's mom buy these in bulk. The custard is full and oh-so-smoooooth.Provence is much NOMS. I particularly like this outlet, there's a homely cozy feel to its d\u00e9cor, perhaps I should sit down one day to have a cuppa.",

If you've had Japanese mayo or Japanese bread with the egg mayo like stuffing, you will know what I am talking about. The mayo is rich but not overpowering like the western mayo. The prepacked sandwiches here are also one of the best I've had in Singapore. The ridiculously priced prepacked sandwiches at 7-11 should be replaced by these!",

They're a lot more available now, but why bother when there are so many other tasty things to eat? I really like their milk buns (rich custardy filling) and orange bun. There is also a selection of sandwiches and hot food (though I've only had breakfast) for you to nom on site too.",

Bread is a big thing in Japan, and they've adopted the same mentality when it comes to baking their bread here as well. Each piece of bread is handmade from scratch and the quality has not dipped before. It has remained constant over the years since I first had it. Even with the opening of Maison Kayser and Paul, Provence still manages to hold its own against these two bread heavyweights.",

    "text": "Provence has become more well-known in recent years, with more branches in Vivo City and in Orchard, but nothing beats the Provence at Holland Village. As a small shop on its own, it allows customers to sit in and consume their breads while being able to enjoy the general peace and quiet that graces Holland Village most of the time in the day. With a welcoming setting that is both brunch-or-snack-friendly, diners can enjoy their coffee or morning chat where the smell of bread helps put one on the right track to start the day. Highly recommended: Black sesame pizza($2.20) and Milk Pan($1.50). The black sesame pizza is bursting with tomato sauce and mayonnaise, and the pizza delicious enough to make you want to throw your diet plans out the window. The Milk Pan is full of cream, and if you fancy milky food, this will be a hit with you. There are many other delights that I have not yet tried, but which seem equally appetizing. Drop by during opening hours: Mon-Fri 9.30am-8.30pm, Sat-Sun 8.30am-8.30pm.",
