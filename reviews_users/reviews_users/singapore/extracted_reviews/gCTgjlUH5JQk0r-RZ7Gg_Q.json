    "text": "When its the Lunar New Year and literally every single Chinese Restaurant is closed, there is a lot of pressure to give my tourist friends the opportunity to try Singapore's famous Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab. \u00a0Penang Seafood Restaurant to the rescue!Forget Jumbo, Long Beach, No SignBoard Seafood (not the one in Geylang), Penang Seafood Restaurant offers a true local experience. The food is fantastic, service is ehh (our waiter constantly struggled to finish his train of thought when trying to explain something or answering one of our my queries), ambience, well, it's a little run-down (its Geylang after all).In terms of the stars of the show, the Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab respectively, they were solid and every bit satisfying. The sauce of the Chilli Crab was definitely on the spicy side, but not unbearable. I still prefer the thick, sweet, slightly spicy sauce of the Jumbo Seafood Chilli crab, but nonetheless the Chilli crab at Penang Seafood restaurant was a good alternative. The Pepper Crab was unique. It was the first time I tried a saucy Black Pepper Crab. The ones I'm used to are definitely not drenched with all that pepper, but smatterings of pepper here and there. Surprisingly, it wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. Overall, a great location to grab Malaysian/Singapore seafood favorites. I still prefer Jumbo's Chilli crab or Long Beach's Black Pepper Crab outright. However, if you factor the roughly 20-30% discount offered at Penang Seafood for the very same dishes vs. those offered at SG's famous seafood chains, then the comparison is just about even. :D",

    "text": "Did a last minute check with the buddy who stays in the area as our \"dictionary\" for food is running out of ideas as we were quite limited to the usual Beef Kway Teow and Frog Porridge in Geylang for dinner. She recommended Penang Seafood Restaurant which is just a stone throw away from Ajunied Station.The Penang Restaurant which is also serving Cze Char is bustling with people. Not to worry about the seats as the turn over rate there is rather high. Servers are rather polite and quick to attend to our orders.The environment gave a feel that we are in Malaysia and even the variety of drinks they served is so closed to what the usual coffeeshops in Malaysia offers, Ice Jelly, Herbal Tea and even Lime juice with sour plum.Lime Juice - $2 EachThe safest choice to order if you are lost among the dishes in the extensive menu. If you have heard of Penang Cuisine, Assam Laksa is one of their staple dishes. This signature dish of theirs is sour by default with Tamarind (Asam). Look around the tables, I bet you will see majority ordering this. And if you like sour and sweet food, this is a perfect choice as the bowl is filled with ingredients like shredded cucumbers, onions, chillis, pineapple, lettuce and mackerel fish. The level of sourness is very well executed and appetizing. Better than average and its addictive.Penang Assam Laksa - $4.80 (Small)Penang style of Char Kway Teow is usually not of my preference as I prefer the Singaporean style that is usually coated with the sweet black sauce. Surprisingly, these plate of flat rice noodles was remarkable with its \"Wok Hei\" taste coupled with ingredients like bean sprouts, cockles, chinese sausage, prawn, guchai and egg. Its aromatic but just too bad, the man insisted that he prefers our local style.Penang Char Kway Teow - $5 (Small)With Salted Egg Yolk trend still in the hype, they have kept their food menu up to date! With this being the chef recommended dish, I had expected more with something outstanding. No doubt the sauce is creamy and yummy, the dish still lacked the fragrant as well as the Wow factor.Fried Sotong with Salted Egg - $13 (Small)Beware of the steaming hot plate below the bloated aluminum pack. Loving the way how this dish is prepared in the aluminum pack and slit open in front of us when being served on our table. Herbal taste is evidently packed with an alcohol infused whiff from the Chinese wine. Steamy herbal soup is sweetened with the use of sweet dates and wolf berries. Beside that, ginger strips and mushrooms were also part of their ingredient. All was good except that I'm not too keen with chicken with bones bits in it.Hot Plate Wine Chicken - $16 (Small)Penang Seafood Restaurant offers a decent fare of Cze Char dishes and since there are many other signature dishes like LaLa and Hokkien Mee that we have yet to try out. I don't mind coming back again.",

    "text": "We went there for 3 Penang dishes - char kway teow, Penang Hokkien mee (prawn noodles) and Assam Laksa. The queue was long on a Saturday night, at around 830pm. The guy managing the line and order taking was very efficient. He remembered where people were seated and what they ordered. What took us by surprise was that if you only have 2-5 in your group, you could be sharing a big round table with other parties of 2-5 too. The good thing, your wait could be halved. The bad thing, it was hard to have a proper conversation with everyone seated along the curve of the table. Our table had 3 other groups of diners. It was a bit disconcerting to say the least. There are a few numbers on the big table to indicate the various parties. We did not try the zi char dishes though the fish curry which seemed to be a favorite of many tables looked delicious. The Penang dishes we had, while good, were a bit underwhelming. Maybe our expectations were high after reading the good reviews on Yelp and other personal blogs. Char Kway Teow - the spiciest of the 3 noodles dishes. The squeeze of lime cut the grease a little and added a zesty refreshing taste to the otherwise lard laden rich dish. There were tiny cockles (quite yum), sliced lap cheong (chinese sausage), sliced fishcake, prawns and beansprouts. Best to share as it can get a bit too much after a while. I did not detect much of a char (wok hei) taste to it. Assam Laksa - very good assam gravy which was very thick and full of flavor. The fish did not disintegrate into tiny bits like in most places, but you could find a few full pieces of fish. A generous lashing of hae kor (prawn paste sauce) was added to the dish when served. Penang Hokkien Mee - this was what we called prawn noodle soup. I liked this even though the soup was not one of the best. It was good enough with an acceptable prawn taste to the soup. We ordered the small prawns and they were really small, almost like the dried shrimp if they shrink any further. The soup was a bit spicy but the noodle itself was fine.",

When I come here I don't really go for the zi char because zi char isn't something that's unique to Penang alone. What I go for are three dishes - the char koay teow, Penang laksa and the Penang Hokkien Mee. The char koay teow comes close to Penang-style ones but the noodles they use are slightly thinner compared to those you can find in Penang but taste wise is pretty similar.The Penang laksa here has a thick assam gravy which is a bit different from those in Penang, In fact, Penang laksa is a bit more watery and soupy. So slightly different in style.The Hokkien Mee (or prawn noodle) is pretty good and tastes the same as those you can find in Penang. Really spicy too, no need to add more chilli into this one.",

Can't really say it's authentic Penang flavour but it certainly was the best I've had in Singapore. The koay teow they used is thin and light in colour but extremely tasty. Their salted egg sotong is also very good. Highly recommend this place; cheap good food!",

The bee hoon is great, as well as the cereal prawn, kangkong belacan, and other dishes. There are 3 sizes for the dishes: small, medium, large - which the waiters can suggest depending on how big your party is. If you think you're not gonna eat much, just order the next smaller portion to what he suggested.",
