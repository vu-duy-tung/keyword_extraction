And let's assume I could only eat chicken rice in Singapore forever and ever... it's safe to assume that I'd be here at Wee Nam Kee at least 3 out of 7 nights stuffing their delectable fowl in my mouth... either the steamed or the roasted variety, I wouldn't be all that fussy.",

    "text": "Singaporeans are very passionate about their chicken rice. It's almost as difficult in trying to get a consensus when asking Chicagoans where to find the best deep dish pizza in the city. Everyone has their favorite chicken rice. Wee Nam Kee is one the popular choices for chicken rice in Singapore.We order half a chicken and the meat is tender. The skin over the pieces of chicken is smooth but without the gelatinous layer under the skin like at Tian Tian. At Wee Nam Kee, the chicken sits on a layer of sweet-savory soy sauce that is very tasty (at Tian Tian, a golden glaze is used instead).When it comes to choosing a personal favorite establishment for chicken rice, it is more than the chicken itself that come into consideration. The accompanying rice, chilli sauce, and ginger sauce are as important and they complete the chicken rice experience. The gold standard of rice that is part of the chicken rice experience should be fragrant (traditionally, uncooked rice is fried with chicken fat before the rice is placed in the rice cooker). At Wee Nam Kee, the rice is almost reminiscent of brown rice and there is a lack of fragrance, though the chilli and ginger sauce are a little better than just good. Overall, the chicken, chilli sauce, and ginger sauce are pretty good but the rice does not stand out here. If you want to have more than chicken rice, the kitchen here prepares other itmes such as deep fried stuffed tofu and stir-fried venison with ginger and scallions.",

As I said in my previous Wee Nam Kee review (for the old location), I like to get the quarter chicken + rice (instead of the standard plate of 'chicken rice') when I eat there for some extra chicken. Along with the Wanton Soup and Sambal Kang Kong... this combination makes for the perfect meal.And if you've never had chicken rice before, the condiments MAKE the meal! Yes, all three - the chill sauce, ginger and the black sauce. I know a lot of people like Tian Tian and all the other famous places as well but in my opinion, Chicken Rice really doesn't get much better than at Wee Nam Kee! This place does get crowded though - be prepared to fight for a seat during lunch / dinner rush hour. Apart from their Chicken Rice, I die for the Salted Fish Fried Rice here too (not that you normally would think of ordering anything else - but everything else is surprisingly good too)! Since they have moved to United Square, as expected, prices have definitely gone up. However, for the same great food + air-con? I'm not complaining! I'm just happy the food quality remained the same!",

First, let me say, this place is always packed (a very good sign) so get there early or prepare to wait. \u00a0 Lucky for us, we got to the restaurant before the crazy dinner rush and were quickly shown to a table. Ten minutes later there were no open tables.  Upon seating us in the air conditioned dining room, the waitress brought water, then started us off with an amazing broth. Good thing because both of us were starved. We slurped it down pretty fast and to our amazement she came over and refilled our bowls. Very cool.Since it was just two of us, we kept it simple. We ordered, of course, the chicken rice. But the baked version. It was perfectly prepared. Moist on the inside, crispy skin on top plus a large helping of lightly flavored rice. It's easily my top five chicken rice in Singapore. The \u00a0other dish was the Venison. AMAZING. AMAZING!!! I do not know which chef whipped up this dish, but I wish I could hug him. Brilliant. Five f*ing stars for the venison. Next time I visit this restaurant, my plan is to order an extra venison to go so I can lick the plate when I am done. It's that good! Trust!",

    "text": "Who knew such a simple dish as Chicken Rice could be so good! And you know what, very few, if any, do it better than Wee Nam Kee. \u00a0Wee Nam's Chicken Rice comes in two distinct forms: Steamed or Roasted. Wee Nam's speciality is undoubtedly the \"Roasted\" Chicken Rice. I prefer dark meat, so I usually order the Drumstick Rice. Regardless of your order, whether the regular chicken rice or drumstick rice, you are in for a treat.The roasted chicken rice delivers a crunchy skin, but yet is soo juicy on the inside. The flavours of the chicken just seem to secrete out of the skin. These chicken flavours are so good that I don't even bother to use Chilli sauce or the sweetish dark sauce that normally accompanies Singapore Chicken Rice dishes. The cilantro sprinkled on top is just heavenly.I've tried three Wee Nam Kee locations and the one in United Square is clearly the best. I'm not sure if it's the original, but it's just that much better. Service is suspect, but then again, one doesn't go to Wee Nam for the service, but rather for the food. Fair Warning: any dish outside of chicken rice could take a while to serve.The Bottom Line: Wee Nam delivers a killer Roasted Chicken Rice. If you prefer steamed Chicken Rice, Tian Tian still reigns supreme in my book. The United Square Branch is The Crown Jewel of the Wee Nam Kee franchise!",

Some complain it's a bit pricey for chicken rice, but in my opinion, it's still pretty affordable considering it's air conditioned.I've tried both their (steamed/boiled?) chicken and their roasted chicken. If you've seen me on Talk answering questions about chicken rice and local cuisine, you'll know which one I'd almost marry (*whispers* it's the roasted one!)After a year and a half on the island, I'm surprised at how I'm starting to notice the difference between everyone's recipes. I think Wee Nam Kee has the best chicken, but I stand by Boon Tong Kee's rice as the more flavorful and fragrant contender.I'm a bit wary of recommending this place for someone who's never tried chicken rice, as I'm unsure if they'd appreciate or enjoy it as much. Plus, there are no ang mo celebrity chef endorsements here. :-P This is a great location in Novena; however you can also check out their other outlet in Marina Square if you can't venture too far from CBD.",

So good that we ended up ordering another drumstick.Rice is fluffy and flavorful. And I also liked that their chilli is spicier than the usual places ( which seems to be toning down the flavor to suit western palate) and they still serve it with the best kind of dark soy sauce (silky, thick, not too salty, takes forever to pour out of the bottle. Yeah!)Thanks to the yelp singapore king, I saved half of my carb stomach for their $1 plain noodles.

One spot consistently appears on all of the major lists and reviews to find it: Wee Nam Kee. Don't let its multiple locations make it appear like a \"chain\" and touristy, it is serving up some pretty damn good bites and worth a visit.While I'm no expert on another countries national dish, it was pretty good in my book and I'd go back for more. The chicken was beautifully cooked and the meat moist through it all and its simple flavors were quickly brought out by the fragrant rice filled with ginger and spice from garlic. Add the soy or chili flavored sauces on the side to your liking and your set.The roast meats that you can order weren't too shabby and the saut\u00e9ed vegetables were pretty delicious (but not worth a 14 hour flight for). Service is quick and efficient, while the line does add a bit of a wait time, it moves at a decent pace. Prices are pretty reasonable so you could enjoy a few dishes to share. The ambiance is simple and loud, so probably not the best for that high-level dinner meeting or that romantic special evening. In a city filled with so many options, would I go back? Heck yeah..it was pretty good and I know I won't be disappointed.",

For anyone visiting Singapore, you must try the Hainan Chicken Rice. The fragrant rice is my favorite part (I ate 2 servings myself) and I am also a big fan of adding lots of dark soy sauce to the chicken. You should also order the sambal vegetables, which is amazing (I honestly thought the vegetables were more yummy than the chicken itself). To complete the meal, you should also order the soup of the day with it.",

The reason I keep returning to WNK as my favorite chxn rice place is simply because it is so delicious. The roast chicken is my favorite because of the nice skin and tender meat pieces. I also prefer that my ginger and chili pastes are separated in separate containers like it is here. I like to make my own concoction. WNK is a well established restaurant and clientele will continue to flock here for their Hainanese dishes. I was amazed to find out that the founder of WNK doesn't even cook at all. Great story, great food.",

They don't tell you... until you open it and they will automatically put it on your tab.. i felt like this was a scam. I never asked for wet napkins and they dare to charge?

Definitely a good call to go early since she was in a rush to return to work. The line started to form after noon but we were seated slightly before the rush.Keep in mind that they leave wet naps on the table which will be added to the bill if you use them. The chicken rice was amazing and it came with soup on the side. We also ordered some veggies, BBQ pork and roasted pork. \u00a0The chicken was the highlight of the meal and the prices were reasonable.The pork was not outstanding since I have had better elsewhere. The portions were average but it is great that you are not stuffed by the end of the meal. Service was similar to a food court as they moved from one into their own location. I do crave the tender chicken and will come back if I have the chance to return to Singapore.",

I would say our meal was really good. The chicken is moist and flavorful and the rice is just as tasty. We ordered half a steamed chicken and extra sauce. Yum. Cereal prawns was also something we ordered that I've never tried before and I found it to be the balance of crunchy sweet and then savory. They made it pretty well. We also got some local veggies and a hot plate dish of veggies, shrimp, and tofu. Roast chicken was yummy too. Overall, I'd recommend wee nam kee and would come back to this location. Tip: it gets busy, so get there early so you don't have to queue too long",

If you have ever come across the CNN Go World's 50 most delicious food, you'll see this traditional dish stands confidently at number 45. Thus, there's no reason to skip it while we were in Singapore. Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice restaurant was our pick. The place is located on Thomson Road in the Novena area. We've heard many good stories about this place, and the experience turned out to be great.When it comes to chicken rice in Singapore, steamed and roasted chickens are among the top. At Wee Nam Kee, the chicken is super tender and lean. It was cooked beautifully, so delicious that you can taste the moist and juicy meat on your first bite! Don't forget to make yourself the perfect dipping sauce to have the greatest flavor experience. Combining chili sauce, ginger paste and low sodium dark soy sauce, you'll make up a perfect condiment to go with this dish. Eating companion is a bowl of fluffy rice, which boosts your appetite at an instant. More importantly, a meal for two will cost you anywhere from S$10 to S$16, which is a superb price tag!Recommendation: Roasted and steamed chicken rice, soy sauce chicken riceRead our Singapore Food Guide: thecoupleeats.com/singap\u2026",

It blends beautifully without distractions.The dumpling was not bad but not the star. I would have to try the noodle version as recommended by the king of Singapore aka Nik T some day. The place is very noisy and if you are prone to headache, you may want to get it to go instead. The service is very brusque and efficient and one does not really linger over the meal.",
