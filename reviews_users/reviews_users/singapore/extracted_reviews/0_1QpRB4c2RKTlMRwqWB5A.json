    "text": "I've been going to Tomi for a few years and the standard has been pretty consistent. Quality sushi and sashimi served at solid prices. Service is polite and generally fast. Decor isn't anything fancy; I wouldn't recommend this as a date place. The lunch specials are pretty worth it. $25 for a sashimi lunch set (sasimi, rice, pickles, soup and appetizer, fruit and salad) and $28 for a chirashi don set (chirashi don, soup, salad, fruit and chawanmushi). I've ordered a la carte (from the regular and monthly specials menu). It was very good but it added up quickly! Tomi renovated a few months ago and while the prices and quality for the lunch specials haven't changed, the portions have gotten a tad smaller! I guess something had to give. A new addition with the renovation: they now sell bottles of sake to go, at a slightly cheaper price than dining-in!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Tomi Sushi for the longest time and finally got the chance to do so. After reading reviews that the sushi is better than the other items, I decided to go for the daily lunch special ($30++) instead of the Nigiri Sakura set. The daily lunch special includes deep fried salmon cheeks in sauce, sushi, chawanmushi, miso soup, salad and fruits. I find the sushi is ok, it is better than the usual sushi chain, but not as good as expected. I guess I should have tempered my expectations a bit. The fish is fresh but the uni could be better. The salmon cheek pieces were drenched in the sauce that it was too salty sweet for my taste and there were so many bones and scales to make it enjoyable. Pork cheek it is not. My bad for equating cheeks to tender morsels of meat. The chawanmushi was a nice surprise. No bubbles in it. It was silky smooth and slid down easily. The miso soup was average. The salad had too much dressing in it. I should have ask for all sauces and dressing to be on the side. Fruit dish was the nondescript slice of watermelon and grapes. The service was ok, they only went round topping hot tea when the room was packed which was about a quarter past 12. I like the bright and airy dining room which makes it a pleasant dining experience. There is another section which is the sushi counter where you can watch the sushi chefs slice and dice and make your sushi in front of you.",

Claiming that he never eats sushi in Singapore from any other restaurant, my sushi-loving siblings were more than eager to go but...there were a few hiccups and we were late. We arrived at 2pm on the dot, just as they were closing the kitchen. After much negotiation with the waitress, she let us in on the condition that we finish our food by 2.30. However, we were informed that the kitchen does not serve hot food anymore, and as I'm not a huge fan of sashimi and sushi, we were somewhat bummed. A minute later, this was fixed by my father talking to the chef so I'd say, 2 thumbs up for service excellence. The food was excellent, especially the sushi sets. I can't comment on sashimi that I don't eat but the sushi sets at lunch were worth the price, although the other dishes such as tempura and maguro katsu pale in comparison. If you do visit, you're better off ordering a pure sushi set because I have to concur with my dad but I don't think the other dishes were quite as worth the while. Do arrive on time though because rushing a meal is never good for digestion.",

The sushi was excellent, and as the wasabi is already in the nigiri, there is no additional wasabi. The style is definitely very close to what you will eat in Tokyo, and the sushi was very good. \u00a0The rice was good, but the texture was different from what I usually expect - it was less firm here, but still very good. The sake list focuses on selections from Niigata, which is one of my favorite regions, and the prices were reasonable. \u00a0I'll definitely be coming back, as they are having some unagi specials including Hitsumabushi! \u00a0Very highly recommended \u00a0for a more traditional, authentic taste without blowing the bank.",
