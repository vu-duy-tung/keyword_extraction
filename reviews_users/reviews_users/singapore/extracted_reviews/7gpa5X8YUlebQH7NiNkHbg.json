They were so interactive, makes a small talk (reminds me on my latest cruise experience, standard of service is impeccable) makes u comfortable while dinning. Very professional as they advice u on how long the food's gonna be served. Especially when you are starving, waiting time can get u agitated. Haha!We ordered steak and the doneness is just perfect!Will definitely recommend this place to my friends :)",

    "text": "Came for the 1 for 1 lunch promotion which is $24 for 2 mains. That's a really good price for italian in Singapore so I thought it was worth a try. But as expected, the food itself was nothing but satisfactory. I got a vegetarian pizza and a penne arrabbiata. The pizza had a nice crust but the cheese was very heavy and the vegetables used seemed on the cheaper side, making it overall quite a forgettable pizza for me. The arrabbiata was good though. The main saving grace for me was their tiramisu and honestly, I would come back here just for it. It had the perfect ratio of cake, cream and coffee. I'd recommend this place if you're in the area and just looking for a good lunch deal.",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner date at Capricci.Every once in awhile, I have a meal at a restaurant and it seems like I was eating at a completely different place from every one else that reviewed it.Capricci was one of these experiences.For instance, there are comments that make this Capricci sound home-style in its ambiance. \u00a0To us, it seemed like a restaurant that couldn't figure out if it is a restaurant or a lounge. \u00a0I mean how many home-style Italian restaurants have a DJ stand. \u00a0The front side of the restaurant has a feel like a bad 90's lounge. \u00a0I admit that, with the brick wall, the back area does have a touch of a comfy feel but then with a DJ stand in direct view, this illusion quickly dissipates. \u00a0The music was modern style rock. \u00a0Not exactly classic for an Italian restaurant.There are consistent comments about the food being good. \u00a0Both of our mains were over salted and hers was extremely oily. \u00a0There were also other significant issues with the preparation of the food.The service is pointed to in very positive light. \u00a0For our meal, most of the time, the staff was standing around in a little huddle chatting away.There is even a comment about gratuity not being automatically added. \u00a0As you can see on our receipt, for us, it was.So, somewhere along the way, we had a completely different experience than every one else who reviewed Capricci. \u00a0Even though some of it will be redundant, I will now do my normal review.The ambiance has touches of wanting to be a cozy home-style Italian restaurant. \u00a0But this is off-set by lounge and club-like aspects that detract from this feel.While engaged at the table, the servers were friendly and professional. \u00a0However, when not at the table, they would stand around chatting to each other. \u00a0At times, we had to energetically flag them down to gain their attention.The food ranged from flawed to mediocre to good. \u00a0Unfortunately, the good aspects were early in the meal.Bread - There was a nice complimentary rustic bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.tinyurl.com/azescg9Meatballs - These complimentary meatballs were the best food served to us. \u00a0if I knew what I know now, I would have simply ordered a spaghetti and meatball dish. \u00a0They were tender and tasty with a tangy tomato sauce. \u00a0However, they did not provide small plates for us to use in eating them. \u00a0This was also true for the appetizers. \u00a0They served them like mains without any expectation they might be shared.tinyurl.com/a5xehajCalamari - The breading was very flavourful. \u00a0However, the calamari was very rubbery. \u00a0It is one of the sins of an Italian kitchen to serve rubbery calamari. \u00a0It is too bad because if the calamari had either been of higher quality or better prepared, this might have been a very good dish.tinyurl.com/ax5vgtgCaprese Salad - This was actually pretty good. \u00a0The greens were crisp. \u00a0The tomatoes were quite sweet and lacked any bitterness. \u00a0However, they could use a higher quality mozzarella \u00a0 It didn't have that fresh warmth of a top level mozzarella.tinyurl.com/b6nbk5vSeared Tuna - This was her main and I also tried it. \u00a0If only a dish always tasted as good as it looks. \u00a0This was quite an appetizing looking dish. \u00a0However, it was completely over-salted and tasted as if it had been bathed in oil. \u00a0It bordered on inedible.tinyurl.com/bkk82omLasagna - This was my main. \u00a0There was little or no effort put into trying to make this dish look appetizing. \u00a0I have never seen a lasagna that was flat like this. \u00a0However, the most significant issue was saltiness. \u00a0I quite like salty dishes. \u00a0But, in this lasagna, salt was simply dominating the plate.tinyurl.com/bf785xtWe chose not to try dessert.Receipt ($110.64)If the quality of the experience had been more enjoyable, the price would have been quite reasonable.Overall - The quality and consistency of the food was a significant issue. \u00a0However, the ambiance and service were also inconsistent. \u00a0Capprici just didn't come together for us. \u00a0This was one of the least enjoyable dinner experiences I've had \u00a0in awhile. \u00a0I have no intention of returning.",

We had a drink and struck up a conversation with the manager who gave good advice about rentals in Singapore. The bartenders are very nice also.Another night we were strolling in our new neighborhood and dropped in b/c there was a huge Christmas party with loud music and people just dancing and having fun. We liked the vibe so we dropped in to enjoy the scenery, the loud music, and the drinks. The manager even let me put on a song from my phone.Haven't had the food here but for drinks, it's a fun spot. They even brought out complimentary cream puffs for the whole venue.",

The complementary toasted focaccia bread with assorted spices is a nice touch to have and is always a pleasant way to start dinner. Service is good and efficient, with the manager paying an equal amount of attention to all tables by popping over occasionally to ensure that everything is okay.",

Main highlights : - Chef is Italian- Food is VERY Italian: good, rich and very generous (one Burrata & Parma Ham was a perfect start for 2-3 of us)- Nice friendly and funny atmosphere, which I would say is quite rare here in Singapore- Extensive wine menu with good bottles starting at $60",

    "text": "We were hoping to check out some famous Korean fried chicken across the street but turns out the joint was closed during lunch. We saw a lot of people heading into Capricci and decided it must be decent. Here's why everyone was eating there...A buffet lunch for $10 nett.I am so conditioned to paying through my teeth for lunch in the CBD that the price alone made me curious. That's $8.55 for the actual food yo.We got pretty good quality food for the price. Nothing mind blowing, nothing particularly pricey. There was a salad bar with 3 types of home made dressings and chicken and tuna for proteins. A rather cheesy pot of tomato soup, a magherita and vegetarian pizza and a bain-marie with penne pasta and some tiny chunks of salmon. I wished the pizza was a little more substantial but hey $10 right? So I took a heap of grilled chicken from the salad bar and topped it on my slice. Voila. I thought the vibe of the restaurant was suitably laid back. Service was ok. They didn't show us any menus so only after we got to the counter to pay did we realize there's actually mini desserts for $4-5. Such a shame because I would've loved to try the tiramisu. Adding this restaurant to my list of lunch ideas.",
