    "text": "Very nice place for thai chinese. The rice wine chicken tasted like a distant ancestor of american chinese sweet and sour chicken before it was glopped up and breaded into something gross and sweet. It was a nice dish, with flavorful strands of ginger and garlic. Also enjoyed the pumpkin leaves in spicy sambal. Was joined by an australian who invited himself to sit with me who says he's only in Singapore 5 hours but comes to this restaurant every time he visits. Minimalist decor, but that's just fine for this kind of place.",

Maggie Thai is a solid restaurant offering an extensive menu of Thai and Chinese dishes. Menu items can be ordered in different size/portions to accommodate the single and larger group diners. Ordered the Wat Don (runny eggs but oddly didn't noticed any) hor fun, Thai tofu, sweet & sour pork, and pineapple fried rice. All the dishes were pretty good and average but nothing to make mention of. Enough to satisfy your hunger but not your epicurious pursuits.",

    "text": "After a long sleepless and foodless flight, me and my partner were pretty keen to eat as soon as possible. We picked the first place we passed from our hotel. I felt a bit silly going to a 'Thai' place on my first night in Singapore, but I soon had no regrets.The service wasn't amazing, but it was prompt and sufficient. They were patient with a couple of indecisive tourists. The decor was simple - we were thankful for the air conditioning and amused the dolphins painted on the walls. It all looked a little cheap and average, but there seemed to be a few locals dining in so figured it was good.It wasn't long before our food came out - we ordered rice wine chicken and char kway teow - and we were immediately impressed. The bowl of char kway teow was massive. The warned had warned us it wouldn't be enough to share, but luckily we figured we would take the risk. The rice wine chicken was much smaller, but the taste...my gosh the taste...I am drooling just reflecting on it. A strong mix of ginger and garlic, with chili and of course rice wine. I sort of wish I had ordered rice to soak up all the sauce, but it didn't really need it.We left the restaurant full and extremely satisfied. The best part about it was the price - super cheap! We went on to recommend it to friends who stayed in Singapore later.",

    "text": "Maggie Thai & Chinese Restaurant is more of a zi char eatery than a restaurant because the ambience is nothing to talk about. The setting resembles one that is closer to a coffee shop than anything else. The staff here are mostly from Mainland China, but they do understand a fair bit of English, so language barrier is not much of a problem. The menu consists of dishes that are mainly Chinese-influenced. The 2 dishes that I have grown to love here are the Sweet and Sour Chicken ($9) and Butter Squid ($8). The chicken pieces come in cubes and are deep fried before being coated with a good amount of sweet and sour sauce. There is a distinct flavor of tomato ketchup in the sauce, which makes it slightly tangy. The Butter Squid were deep fried in an egg batter till golden brown together with curry leaves and chili padi. The flavor of curry leaves in this crispy squid was pretty prominent.",

I reckon it's cheaper and a bit better than the restaurant opened by a celebrity down the road.This is just your average Thai/Chinese/SE Asian zi char type place. Boring decor, indifferent waiters, etc. In short, it's just like everywhere else.The saving grace is the food is pretty okay. The green curry is large and satisfying. The fried olive rice was pretty good. The other dishes were not bad. Not wonderful, just averagely decent.",

Food isn't especially authentic, but its cooked to appeal to the masses, a bit like Chinese takeaway.I will quite regularly get the tom yam noodles, a coconut drink or green curry.",

    "text": "We were only in Singapore for two days so, of course, we trusted to Yelp to help us pick something memorable near our hotel. \u00a0We liked the reviews for Maggie and it was only a 15 minute walk so we tried it. \u00a0Fantastic!The evening before (our arrival night) we ate at our hotel and paid $145 for an unusual but not memorable buffet. \u00a0We could have happily stuffed ourselves 5 times at Maggie's for the same price.We followed the suggestions of a couple of other Yelp reviewers and ordered small portions of Rice Wine Chicken (sauce to die for), Char Kway Teow (flat noodles, small shrimp, other stuff in a wonderful sauce), and Butter Squid. \u00a0We also ordered the slivered green mango salad which was wonderful. \u00a0The \"small\" dishes are not small by any standard and every dish was terrific. \u00a0Be sure to order some plain white rice to sop up the Rice Wine sauce. \u00a0The place was packed. \u00a0I'm 70 and my wife is 68 and were the only people in the restaurant over 30. \u00a0It was obviously a happening place. \u00a0We loved watching all the other dishes being brought out to different tables . . . . every dish looked great.Maggie's does not have dessert on the menu but right across the street are two or three restaurants that ONLY sell desserts. \u00a0While we were already stuffed, we just couldn't resist. \u00a0The desserts were very Asian, very unique and very delicious.And of course, we loved eating in air conditioning. \u00a0It was really hot that day!If we ever get back to Singapore,we're going straight back to Maggie's.",
