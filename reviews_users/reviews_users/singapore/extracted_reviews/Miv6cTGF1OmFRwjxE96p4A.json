    "text": "The branch at Novena is now at United Square! I've been told about this, but it took me this long to finally find out for sure!This review is based on a dinner I had on 21 Nov 2014.On a Friday at about 6.30pm is the best time to hit this place. Before the crowds build up and before the place fills up with bbq smoke.The place was vibrant and energetic, with TV screens blasting K-pop without stop. I still find it hard to tell the boy band singers apart. Approx SGD$26 per person. This is value for money.Compared to the previous location and other Ssikkek restaurants, this is the largest and freshest smelling one so far.The buffet line is widely spread out, with condiments and other side dishes on other counters.I like the marinate for the meats here, too. Less sweet and more garlicky.My SOP for a fuss free dinner is as follows: (Still the same, not changed)1. Turn up the flame under the hot plate.2. Get a plate and pick 6 pieces of short rib slices (sliced korean bbq style)3. Grab a sauce dish and pour a lot of sesame oil into it4. Fill a plate with fried glass noodles (and chicken wings if they have it)5. Go back to your table.6. Arrange the slices of short ribs on the already hot plate and watch it sizzle.7. Dribble some sesame oil on the slices.8. Eat the fried glass noodles and wings.9. Flip the short rib slices.10. Eat more fried glass noodles.11. Use the scissors provided to cut the slices into small pieces and continue cooking for a while more.12. Eat more fried glass noodles.13. Move all the short rib pieces onto a clean plate.14. Place more uncooked short rib slices onto the hot plate for a new round.15. Enjoy your short rib pieces.Will I be back? At least once a month. Beef short-ribs goooood.",

Just an all you can eat KBBQ restaurant. I'm not even sure if they offer discounts or coupons. My husband bought his sisters, his mom, and I there and that was the only that time we stopped for dinner.Hopefully they have more specials in the future.",

    "text": "As far as Korean BBQs go, this is one of \u00a0THE most authentic restaurant that I've been to. Its owned and operated by Koreans - how else to get that native feel? Food is fresh and cheap ($22++ per person for a Saturday buffet dinner!) and customer numbers are so insane such that we had to resort to collecting 5 empty plates at a go just to 'stock-up' when the next wave of food hits the buffet corner. *Tip: Grab fresh cups, plates and bowls every time you can! Chances are you won't find any when you go back for subsequent rounds. They serve the usual range of meats; beef, pork and chicken, as well as fresh whole onions and garlic gloves by the BUCKET. Taught by the master/owner/chef himself (Hello Mr Kim!), wrap your BBQ-ed meat in a piece of fresh lettuce, add some kimchi and finish with 1 slice of garlic to eat like a true Korean! I do recommend making a reservation way in advance though, as queues tend to stretch! End off the night with a Melona popsicle (those Korean stars seem to be munching on those constantly don't they?) and don't forget their Sweet Rice Drink, which is basically rice boiled in sweetened water that is awesome for calming your throat after the bbq-ed food. ERP parking is available right at the building, but lots are limited, so be early!",

    "text": "For starters, don't expect restaurant-style comfort of air-conditioning and service and you will be able to have one heck of a meal here.At only $20++, you get to enjoy a decent variety of korean mains, side dishes and of course, meat for all the helpings you can afford so come with a hungry tummy! I liked the selection of side dishes, covering cold to hot dishes which was a nice thing to nibble on in between grilled meat helpings. You can get the regular kimchi, vegetables, potato salads, seasonsed ikan bilis - all displayed in huge trays as if willing you to go for as much as you can!The meat selection is good too - you have a variety of marinated beef, chicken and pork in different cuts as well as sausages. I also especially like that everything is clean and well-presented and always refilled to the brim. You basically pick all you want and grill them on the platter, wrap the meat with rice in your lettuce leaf (very fresh!) for an authentic korean BBQ meal. You can then round it all off with icecream for only $1 a pop. Came with a large bunch of friends who can really eat - it'll be fun!",

    "text": "I like Korean BBQ as much as the next person, but when you add the word \"buffet\" after it, I go friggin NUTS! How do they not have these in the US?! Probably because we Americans eat too damn much and if you offered it to us, we'd all act like animals and it'll become The Hunger Games real quick...It is smart to make reservations here no matter what day it is. I didn't think there'd be many people for a Tuesday evening, but I made a reservation just in case. I was right to do so, as the place was packed with a lot of big groups. Meat eaters, you're going to be in paradise when you get to the buffet. You'll see deep trays of marinated meats- pork, chicken, and beef. They also have bacon, sausages, and seafood. If you're not into marinades, they do have regular cuts of meat not marinated, but I think you'd be crazy not to try the marinades as they are AMAZING. They also have a good amount of sides to choose from. I loved their noodles (the one on the warmer) and the chicken wings.If you run out of water, you can also get calamansi juice, which is in a machine next to the buffet, and included in the price. I missed out on the other drink though, as it was already out for the night!And best of all, since this is a Korean place, they play K-pop performances on TV! YESSSSS.As we paid our bill, we asked where they will be moving, since Novena Ville is closing. Luckily, they said they'll be down the street at United Square, so hooray for being able to stay nearby!",

    "text": "As far Korean BBQ buffets go... this is my NUMBAH ONE FAVOURITE. But of course I have to qualify the statement. Or do I? I'll tell you anyway.1. Its cheap. Seriously. Weekday lunch at $12+ for adults, and NINE for kids?! Unheard of. Even $22+ for dinner and weekends is cheap. 2. The food is gooooooood. The sheer number of people who come here means food moves fast. and that means the food get replenished, and that means the food is fresh. Lots of meat (YUM) and tasty chapchae (fried sweet potato noodles) too.3. The team have super eyes. Not only do they brave the bbq smoke, but also spot a charred piece of foil on your grill faster than you can complain about it. And we're a pretty complainy bunch, aren't we?4. They have this cold roasted barley drink. I can't explain it, but it's amazing.5. Melona ice cream sticks at $2.Okay. I'm done convincing. In fact, don't go. I kinda want it to be be a little less crowded when I go there next.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner to meet up with JC friends whom I've not seen since 2009. Did not choose the place evidently. This is, on an absolute basis, a cheap restaurant for Korean barbeque at $25 -ish per head after taxes. It works for people who just want to eat large volumes of meat... I guess. My take is fairly simple - for $25, I can get a fairly decent and filling meal in that area and in Singapore. I could eat a well stuffed burrito at Muchahos and have change leftover or eat the fried chicken buffet at Chicken Up. If I wanted meat, I could have a steak with sides at Astons if I was desperate. Ssikkek literally gives you the equivalent of what you could do at home for the same price. I mean obviously you're cooking your own food, so there's no value add from the restaurant's kitchen. The raw materials \u00a0are certainly not cheaper than what you'd get at distributors - frozen meat from mmmm or QB food (there are cheap chicken franks too that even QB doesn't carry) with bottled marinade, a very basic grill with gas to power it, diluted Korean tea and utensils. I think highlighting that freshly thawed frozen meat is fresh is like saying oh the restaurant has clean and strong air conditioning. That's a given if you're eating out. If not, you should be filing a lawsuit. If we were getting value from the cuts of meat offered (or grass fed beef for example) I'd be impressed but really, you're getting exactly what you pay for and perhaps a little less. The cooked food station looked pretty gross.In addition, unlike home, there is no ventilation system so you get grease on your face and meat stink. The floors are incredibly slippery as well. Apparently the servers change your grill thingies often but ours didn't get swapped out until the end when we finally flagged down a waitress. The restaurant looks like an air conditioned canteen. Oh and if hell for you is k-pop videos playing non-stop, don't say I didn't warn you. This ain't for everyone. It sure wasn't for me.",
