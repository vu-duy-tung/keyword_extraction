    "text": "It's not as cheap as Waraku but it promises better quality and wider variety of dishes than similar family restaurants such as Ootoya. Having been to this place for Nth times, the food is still as delicious as I remember. The \u9ed2\u8c5a\u30c8\u30ea\u30d5\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30cf\u30f3 Black Pig Truffled Fried Rice ($18.80) has a relatively starchy texture compared to usual Chinese fried rice as Japanese short-grained pearl rice is used. Perfumed with the umami fragrance in a good way that complemented the flavors of the pork, this ugly but tasty dish is a rare gem amidst the zenith of wayward uses of truffle these days. The Grilled scallops with Mentaiko Cheese Sauce ($12.80) is the kind of cheesy comfort food that would heal any depressive feelings but it would be perfect if they can use the fresh plump white scallops instead of the red ones. One of the most delicious unagi you can find in Singapore.Mentaiko Tonkatsu (set with rice and pork miso soup $23.30/ala carte $19)Tonkatsu is one of the signatures at Tampopo besides its Black Pig Ramen. This is actually better than Saboten as the cutlet is tender, juicy and not too dry. Plus, with the presence of mentaiko, one won't miss the sweet tonkatsu sauce.Skip the new Tampopo Poke Salad ($13.80) and the Matcha Parfait ($8.50). The chunky lettuces and raw sashimi cubes were two separate entities that did not bond well with each other. For the latter, it tasted like cheap ingredients pieced casually together. I'm also having reservations about their signature scoop cake ($7). Perhaps having sat in the fridge for the entire day, the cake and the cream were stale and dry. But still I have good faith in their chiffon cakes at Dulcet Studio and will return to try them. Nonetheless, you can stake your bets on these three ice cream items. I'm deeply in love with this smooth Black Sesame ice cream ($3) that bursts of intense earthy flavour. The cylindrical-shaped Matcha and Chocolate Ice Cream ($5.50 each) must have been loaded with bags of matcha and cacao powder because they are so rich yet not overly sweet. Light, wonderful endings to a good meal with good company.",

The noodles were the yellow and curly kind. I would have appreciated if the ramen came with more vegetables. The place is pretty popular so come early or you will have to queue for a while and obviously you won't feel like lingering after eating your meal with so many people waiting outside. Haha.",

However for the noodle, it is a bit so so. \u00a0Last weekend, i went here again and decided to try something different. I ordered their hokaido ramen last week and the noodle tasted better than the noodle in black pig ramen. I wonder if they can do it or not. \u00a0But i'll definitely give a shot next time.For appetizer or side dishes, please order their wafu beef. It is so good , especially if you are okay with medium cooked beef. But you can choose how well they cook it.",

Had a long walk from Tangs plaza all the way to Takashimaya and finally we get to a place where there is no queue at all.Tampopo .... I have heard or read about this place before and I have never tired any of it before. Today is my chance and I get to taste it.Seriously, I'm not a Ramen fan and I do have a soft spot for Udon as compared to Ramen. \u00a0I ordered the Harumaki Salad $12.80 (its a wrap salad with veg and salmon) \u00a0Deluxe Shabu Ramen $16.50 was on average the soup base taste alittle bland to me and lastly this is the 1st time i had the smallest chawanmushi served ..... The portion is really petite and it cost $6.00.I gave this place a 3 stars as there's nothing for much special for me to rant about. But I would love to highlight that the staff is service oriented and they do play apart in my \u00a0dinning experience.Will I pop over again for a meal? Yes, maybe I will .....",

Yesterday was no exception.I ordered the Yasai Itame Ramen (S$14.30) while my friend ordered the Deluxe Tampopo Black Pig Shabu Ramen (S$16.30).Verdict:Yasai Itame Ramen - Pork slices was insufficient but it was very thinly sliced which makes it easy to chew. Broth was excellent and doesn't have a strong overpowering pork smell.Deluxe Tampopo Black Pig Shabu Ramen - My friend felt that the pork slices had a porky smell but it seemed ok to me. The soup was lighter then my ramen and tastier too.Overall, I felt that the portions were too big and would be better if they offered more options for half-sized ramen.",

    "text": "I've always been curious about tampopo, given that it was rather popular quite a few years back, and there are healthy queues when I pop by town on the weekend. it's the first time I've been here after walking pass so often, and I've got to say I've doubts as to whether there's any point in coming here, since prices are about the same as sushi tei and ichiban boshi, and the flavours are nowhere as good.it reminds me of watami quite a lot - both are relatively cheap japanese options with huge laminated menus suited for japanese food plebs. I also retract my \"nowhere as good\" from before, for I think it's more that the food is rather rough around the edges, and not quite refined, akin to the sort of japanese food you get at a food court stall.so while it means there's absolutely nothing for me rant about, there's also very little I can say. imagine a pretty satisfying food court meal - you went there because you were hungry and it was cheap and options abound, but you had your heart set on japanese nearly so much anything would do, and then this plate of japanese-looking food arrives - good enough to sate, cheap enough not to complain, and tasty enough to be more than edible.everything was pretty pedestrian, but I've got to mention the tonkatsu - which was rathe rincredibly juicy, with a crisy golden-brown breadedness. it also seems to be rather a house specialty, so I recommend getting this if anything.so, really, no complains, but no real recommendation either. it's cheap for being in town, and an almost mindless option if you're in one of those moods when food needs to fill rather than sate - but otherwise, cross the road to the sushi tei at paragon (my favorite branch of the chain).",

    "text": "I used to be obsessed with Tampopo when the ramen craze had not yet reached our sunny shores, because its ramen was out-of-the-world for me. The rich broth that was flavourful and hearty had me going to the Liang Court outlet on a monthly basis. However, when the numerous ramen chains started to pop up all over the city, I started to neglect Tampopo...Well, this will not happen anymore. After a year since my last visit to Tampopo, I finally returned to my previously number 1 place for ramen. And I'm glad to say that it was as yummy as I had remembered it. I ordered the Ramen with Tonkatsu this time round, and was quite surprised to see that the broth was a bright orange, almost like laksa broth. It was a bit spicy, which was perfect - added just the right amount of kick to each mouthful. The tonkatsu was quite nicely done too. The only unpleasant part of the Tampopo experience was the long queue for a table, but trust me, it'll be worth it.",

    "text": "Tampopo Restaurant is a place I often patronize to satisfy my ramen cravings. This branch at Ngee Ann City is more brightly lit and has a better ambience than the one at Liang Court. There is only one thing that comes to mind when I think about Tampopo - Tonkatsu Ramen. This place has always been famous for its tonkatsu, but its ramen is really good as well. I never liked tonkatsu that was too fatty or that has a thick layer of batter, and this one is nothing like that. The batter is thin and deep fried to a crispy golden brown. The meat itself is lean and not dry. It is best eaten with the ramen, which has broth so flavorful that you might not leave a drop behind. The broth is also slightly spicy, which adds a kick to the dish. With smooth and springy noodles, the dish is pretty much complete. The prices are more on the steep side, so it is probably not a place to eat at regularly. The service was poor; we had to repeat our request for condiments a few times before they actually gave it to us.",

    "text": "This is ranked number two on my list of best ramen places for its black pig shabu shabu ramen. If you are visiting the restaurant in pairs, adding an additional portion of meat and noodles is more than enough for two. Once served, you can smell the fragrance of the thick and somehow creamy tonkotsu soup. The flavours literally fill your mouth with every sip, whereby you can taste the creamy and saltiness that can only come from soup that is stewed for several hours. Delicious. The yellow noodles and springy but slightly hard to prevent it from soaking up too much of the broth. Thinly sliced pork from black pig is fragrant and tender, with just the right amount of fats still on them. Not too overwhelming but enough to alleviate the taste. Add them all together and you get a heavenly mouthful of ramen. Pieces of bamboo shoot are also delicious and are always fresh and crunchy. Other than ramen, other main courses like black pig tonkatsu and a range of desserts. The decor of the restaurant fits its image as a casual Japanese dining restaurant. Decorative pieces of origami butterflies are draped across the lighting fixtures to emphasise on the Japanese culture.",

The ramen at this Orchard outlet did not seem to taste as good as the one at Clarke Quay. I'm not sure if it was just the day that I went to, but the soup did not carry the richness and fragrance of the Clarke Quay store and there seemed to be fewer items on the menu than the Clarke Quay store. With many other ramen stores around in Orchard, I wouldn't probably visit Tampopo here again.",
