    "text": "This is old school but old school good.Usual classics for us:- that pork chop! Its like molasses with crisp bits and garlic flavour? Boneless so no need to wrestle.- that prawns dish! Big fresh prawns. Sweet fresh and sticky black sauce is like drugs!- paper chicken. Yes its greasy. If you must lose the skin, it still tastes so good. So tender and seasoned all the way to the middle.- any claypot dish. The chicken is huge by the way. We really enjoyed the liver. Perfectly done so dig in right away so it doesn't overcook. Also had a \"light veg\", gravy was part sauce part soup (ok maybe it was gravy but we drank it like soup).- the sambal kangkong is a good standbyMy family came here regularly when i was young. We took a break and now we are back as regulars. We brought our Japanese visitor and she loved it. Lots of Japanese frequent here, families, couples, friends.One area of improvement. No dessert.",

    "text": "We've lived across the street from Hillman for nearly three years, but were just introduced to it by a friend and I think we'll be regulars soon. I haven't found enough good Cantonese restaurants in Singapore yet, but now I know I live right next to one. This is good, homestyle Cantonese food, not dim sum or roast duck (which I also love, of course).My favorite dish was the crab meat with bean curd, which comes swimming in a delicious eggy sauce. \u00a0The paper chicken is also highly recommended - tender chunks of chicken that are cooked in a thin parchment paper to help seal in the juices. \u00a0You'll definitely get messy unwrapping it. \u00a0They have a lot of stews and casseroles cooked in clay pots, and we tried the beef, which was very good - perfect comfort food.Hillman is definitely worth a visit if you're craving homey Cantonese food.",

    "text": "Sometimes you want to go to a restaurant that reminds you a little bit of home, but with a little extra something something (mom, your food still rocks!)I imagine that the dishes at Hillman Restaurant are what would fill up the table in a Cantonese home with a great cook or two.The food:There are a few stars of the show here and the first category falls into \"various goodies in pots\". \u00a0We have had the beef stew as well as the special (aka seafood and vegetable) stew and both were flavorful, well seasoned, and comforting. \u00a0Another must is the paper chicken or chicken en papillote (chicken roasted or steamed in parchment paper); this boneless soy sauce chicken is always tender and juicy. \u00a0The crab meat with bean curd doesn't skimp on chunks of fresh crab meat and is a must for crab meat lovers. \u00a0Finally, we had the pork ribs a few times and they have a pleasant tang of worcestershire sauce or vinegar.This place is full of solid, homestyle Cantonese food. It is a perpetual hit with Japanese tourists and I'm surprised it's not more of a hit with locals as well. \u00a0While there are awards and articles from the 1960s, the decor looks like it was redone then too. \u00a0But I'll still eat here whenever I want Cantonese comfort food (let's face it, many of our parents had some pretty poor decor choices too).",

    "text": "An established restaurant- they had photographs dating back to 1965 and old culinary awards on the wall, this restaurant appears to cater to tourists looking for old Singapore style Cantonese food.This restaurant probably appears in every Japanese travel guide book. Throughout dinner at 930, groups of Japanese tourists or expats were either entering or leaving. We were probably the only locals dining there. The same happened in a previous visit.The tourists mainly order the crabs and Singapore bee hoon/ fried rice. We ordered their specialty dishes in clay pot and paper bag chicken. Food was ok, fairly priced but I do think there are other good \"classic\" Singapore style restaurants such as Beng Hiang for hokkien food. I am not sure if I would bring Japanese friends here and introduce this place as an epitome of local fare, but obviously judging from its customer base, many Japanese probably think so.It feels like this place survives purely from its Japanese customers and memories of its past culinary glories.",
