    "text": "One of my top faves has given birth to something new! Maggie Joan's is now open for lunch with sumptuous new specials!Chef Oliver never fails to please with his modern Mediterranean plates and I was super excited to sample their lunch offerings over dinner tasting.Special mention to the house-baked Sourdough with beef fat butter, complimentary to all diners. Such glorious meaty creamy churned goodness on that crackly porous \u00a0slice. I would be happy with that alone (with that delicious Chianti of course)!!! I loved the Cheese Arancini ($9) which is a creamy ball of risotto held together by a blend of cheeses (gorgonzola, epoisse, langres, ricotta). The crunchy exterior gave way to a nice sticky and stringy pull. I thought it was great on its own, with a touch of truffle oil. The sweet Roma tomato chutney with sherry vinegar threw the dish off with its sweetness but the golden balls could be easily saved from the gravy so all's not lost.My recommendation to start? The Cured salmon tartare ($17) with dill, pickled cucumber and yogurt. The rich smoky Norwegian salmon paired perfectly with the cream cheese-like Greek yogurt and then comes the tangy pop of cucumber. There's even an element of crunch from the house made sourdough croutons (can't stop munching on them).I was looking forward to the Gypsy style baked egg with chickpea stew & chorizo ($16) because well.. Nothing like a decadent brunch dish for lunch right? Sadly, the chickpea mix was prematurely removed from the stove and had yet to absorb the moisture and flavor of the tomatoes. The chorizo were kind of dry \u00a0and disappointing as well. Flavor wise, it was a little one dimension with the Mediterranean spice. Skip right to the mains if the starters don't work for you. That Fried Chicken Sandwich ($18) may sound blah, but dayum! The juicy poulet jaune fillet is crusted with Japanese panko and deep-fried. Never have I had a fried chicken breast so tender and juicy without any oily taste. Dressed with a punchy green harissa coleslaw and Pecorino cheese, and sandwiched between a light poofy bread grilled in gd INKA oven, the combination was spectacular. To spruce this meal up further, add on the hand-cut chips with rosemary salt, sherry vinegar & ricotta ($9). Such fragrant triple fried hand-cut Sebago potato chips - steamed, blanched in oil at 140 degrees and deep fried at 220 degrees for that extra crunch. My advice- leave no ricotta behind. Now if the chicken was great, the Homemade Pappardelle, lamb ragu and Parmigiano Reggiano ($26) is better. This is perfect comfort food will make you forget your work woes for the rest of the day. The New Zealand lamb shoulder is roasted for 12h and then caramelized and tossed with the hearty chili-tomato paste, and sheets of al dente Parpardelle (one of my fav pasta, also made in house). The balance of the sauce, mint, and meat is perfect, plus there's the sourdough croutons to pick up the remaining sauce... Heavenly. Those craving for the dinner menu will \u00a0find familiar offerings for lunch - think half roasted duck with carrots and feta, or a 250g stockyard ribeye with jerk seasoning. Finally desserts. Dessert of the day ($10) was a crumbly sugar dough lemon tart. \u00a0This certainly goes on my best tart list! Cheese and wine also makes for a perfect ending to your mid day. ;)The lunch menu is available 12pm to 2.30pm on weekdays. This is making me wish that I work in the city. Badly.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is good, the food well executed but the fact portions are tiny and overpriced left me quite underwhelmed with Maggie Joan'sI came here on a Saturday night (after wandering around Amoy street wondering where the place was) with one of my friends - both of us were not very hungry so we thought we could just share some appetizers. We ordered three appetizers and honestly they all were quite tasty but even if I would have finished all three of them by myself I would still be needing a main.The fact that they charge $3++ for one, yes ONE slice of sourdough is completely unacceptable to me, especially as they offered to bring bread to accompany the appetizers but conveniently forgot to mention that it was not complimentary.In the end, we paid over $200 for three appetizers, one main, two desserts and two glasses of wine which in general I would be ok with for a good meal but I left hungry so I don't think they will see me again at Maggie Joan's anytime soon..",

Had the freshly-made pappardelle with a beef ragu sauce, it was one of the best pastas I've had in Singapore. Service was really prompt too.",

    "text": "Alright I confess, the previous review was 50% motivated by wanting the FTR. I think it's fair though if I'm creating the listing, that I get the FTR. :)Food's spot on at this tucked away 'modern Mediterranean' restaurant, though some might drop a star for being so painfully hard to find. Regardless of what the address says, DO NOT try and find it via Amoy Street. Instead head onto Gemmill Lane, and turn right down the alley at Luke's. You'll see a sign. We ordered... two of the sharing dishes, the steak and the octopus. We also ordered the... bone marrow (a solid though not memorable dish), the pork crackling (pork crackling is pork crackling, you either don't like it... OR LOVE IT TO BITS.) The bread with hummus was excellent; bread wise, and dip wise. In fact, it was so good, we ordered a second portion. The highlight of the evening though had to be the steak and the octopus. One was melt-in-your-mouth tender, the other, firm but not mushy. I'll leave you to guess which was which, but both were just so good.How good? Well it pains me to say it, but the octopus is arguably better than my favourite grilled octopus at Osteria Mozza. Wait. No. Yes. ARGHHH I can't decide.",

    "text": "Visited on a Wed night without a reservation and was seated promptly. The restaurant is hard to find though, it's literally a hole in the wall, just a nondescript door + a sign from an alley. Lighting was also pretty dim, making it hard to take photos. We had the Egg, Dukkah & Saffron Mayo ($6) - essentially a poached egg, rolled in nuts, with a blob of saffron mayo on the side. The egg was poached beautifully, and I loved how it went with the dukkah. It was good enough without the saffron mayo, not sure how necessary the mayo was for the dish. But at $6, it's on the pricey side.Heirloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, bread ($21) - this was definitely a pricey dish for its portion. Tomatoes and cheese were fresh, though the bread came in small bite sized cubes - would have preferred a slice. Poached salmon & fennel ($29) - fish was delicious, juicy and perfectly poached. I enjoyed the fennel very much with the fish, considering I usually don't eat it. Tuna nicoise, aubergine, olives ($34) - This was surprisingly good. The tuna came in 3 large chunks, very meaty, tender and flavorful, and went extremely well with the aubergine. Liked the sundried tomatoes and quail egg topping the dish. Highly recommend this!! Definitely worth it.Was hoping to try their seabass but it was off the menu. Intended to get dessert but none of them sounded exciting so we passed.Food was of consistently good quality, though pricey. Bill came up to $99 in total (incl tax). Definitely a good place for a fancy night out. Wish they had better desserts though!",

Maggie Joan's feels and tastes like it was transported from lower east side NYC to SG. Great contemporary American fare.",
