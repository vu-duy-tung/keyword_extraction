    "text": "Reached out to a local friend when I knew we would be heading back to Sing for another trip and he suggested we check out No 3 Crab Delicacy for chili crab. \u00a0Since this was going to be a short trip, we planned on having a late lunch here only to realize they close in the afternoon right before dinner. \u00a0Not exactly sure their hours but be warned to check their hours before making the trek out to this place. \u00a0Also, they are now located on the ground floor of the Link hotel and not on Outram Road (basically around the block). \u00a0We were the first patrons of the night and the restaurant did seem a bit dead as we were eating. \u00a0Not sure if it was just an off night or if business just wasn't good anymore. \u00a0I was urged to try the rajak chicken along with their chili crab. \u00a0Wasn't sure what to expect with the rajak chicken but it was pretty tasty. \u00a0A perfectly fried thigh of chicken was topped with a sweet/sour/savory sauce with cucumber and some sort of fruit on top. \u00a0Wasn't a big fan of the sauce as the initial bite did have a strong fish sauce flavor but the more I ate, the more I ended up enjoying it. \u00a0The crab here was also pretty good just wished the sauce had a bit more kick to it. \u00a0You will definitely need to order man tou or some sort of noodles to truly enjoy the chili crab sauce.Overall a decent meal that it wasn't \u00a0exactly Hawker food stall prices. \u00a0A nice local restaurant but the wife did say the sauce for the chili crab was slightly different than from what she remembers. \u00a0There are tons of restaurants that specialize in chili crab so not sure I'll be back any time soon.",

    "text": "It's been ages since I visited No. 3 Crab Delicacy Seafood Restaurant so I was thrilled to be able to return for a fix last evening. As we were planning to visit another restaurant after this, we only ordered 2 dishes - both of which are my favourite ones here. We started the meal with a large plate of Drunken Cockles (S$20 / US$14.67). The juicy raw \u00a0cockles had been cured in soy sauce, Chinese wine, garlic and topped with some fresh chili padi (Thai chili). The copious amount of minced garlic imparted a lovely flavour to the dish but doesn't make for a good dish to indulge in if you're on a first date. Another signature dish here is the Curry Crab in Claypot. Even though it's been a long time since I ate here, the rich, creamy curry gravy was as good as I remembered. The flavourful gravy was a perfect complement to the smooth strands of boiled Beehoon (rice vermicelli). The medium-sized Sri Lankan Crab was succulent and so big, it was almost spilling out of the claypot! The Crab dish set us back by S$ 75.40 (US$ 55.28) before 7% GST & 10% service charge. The beehoon is priced at $5 (US$ 3.67) per plate, which though pricey is worth a splurge to be able to fully appreciate the flavourful curry gravy. If you stop by here and have a decent tolerance for spice, do order the Drunken Cockles and Sri Lankan Crab Curry.",

No finger bowls but they have paper napkins.Sometimes I wonder how honest they are about the weight of the crabs. I wish I could bring a weight scale and weight the crabs myself. Seems like a couple of famous people have visited this place too.",

The female owner had mentioned that they had just moved to Tiong Bahru a month ago. \u00a0The cost for the Chili Crab runs around $48 but was worth every cent.",

Sauces were excellent; we had the chili and butter variety. For both the sauces were savory and tasty with crab or simply on rice. Plenty of other nice dishes as well; I liked everything they put in front of me!Great for groups.... Plenty of large round tables.Simple d\u00e9cor, fine service.Good value, we paid about $45/person for 2 HUGE crabs, plenty of entrees and drinks. \u00a0Probably ordered too much as we had leftovers.....Really enjoyed the meal here, so far my favorite crab in Singapore! Would definitely come back.",

    "text": "Forget those tourist traps like Lau Pa Sat or Newton Circus - this is THE place to go for huge crabs. I'm saying like the size of your face huge. Hidden away on a side street by Outram, it's easy to miss this restaurant among the various other zhi char stores nearby, so do come prepared with directions in hand. Open all the way from 11.30am to 11.30pm, many old regulars living in the area drop by for late night indulgences in their signature crab dishes, and I've seen many order crab to go as well. Their top selling dish is obviously the chilli crab, but if you're tired of the usual like me, do try their Butter Crab. It's served drenched in a thick creamy butter sauce, and lightly seasoned with crushed garlic for a plate of steaming fresh delicious seafood. The sauce is also lighter than the spicy chilli or heavy black pepper taste, so it's easier to allow the natural freshness of the crab to be picked up by your palette. This means you can actually appreciate the crab meat and not just the sauces. Their fried Man Tou (buns) are no joke either, dig in while they're hot to enjoy the crispy brown surface and steaming white insides. Dipping it in any of the sauces from the crab dishes just makes them a hundred times better! Price can range from about $30 to $50 per person if a large group for 4 - 6 are sharing 2 crabs, which is definitely more than enough!",
