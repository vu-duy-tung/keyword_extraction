    "text": "This is the first place we tried in Singapore (since it was close to our hotel - Four Point Sheraton) and everything we tried was delicious. Champagne long ribs - this is one of their most popular dish and it was a great balance between salty and sweet. The meat was slightly tough to chew/burnt at the ends but the middle was tender and juicy Fried rice - we were originally going to order the medium one but the waitress suggested the small one since she said that would be enough. She was right! The small rice is enough to comfortably feed at least three people. Cray fish cooked in garlic sauce - this was an in season dish suggested by the waitress. The cray fish was very very fresh - the meat peeled off the shell easily and was a great addition to the other two dishes we ordered. All in all we had a positive experience. The waitress was very nice and helped us order the perfect amount of food. The food was way larger portions than expected ( we were expecting small portions based on the menu photos) everything had great flavor. Highly recommended!",

You could hear the crunch when you bit into the tasty vegetables. Fried rice was the best I had the whole trip to Singapore. It had pieces of shrimp, pork, egg, scallions , with shredded veggie (cabbage?) on top.Prawns and pats were absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this dish and would get it again. Fresh prawns deep fried with shells on covered in oats. Like a shrimp and oatmeal cookies put together!! Yummy! Sounds weird but t works. I swear!Pork ribs were tender and the glaze a balance of sweet and savory. Big hunks of meat and deliciousness. They were not overcooked. The flesh fell off the bone. Loved this dish too. The crispy squid were not for me but my friend devoured them. I can imagine them going well with beer.Each dish is garnished with an edible flower made of a material that reminds me of the host received at holy communion.The place was crowded with lots of large groups but service was still great. We sat outside.",

This is my personal favorite. \u00a0If you don't really like tofu, this might even make you a believer. \u00a0 Ok, maybe not, but definitely worth a try.Cereal prawns. \u00a0They're prawns, so they're not petite. \u00a0Make sure to squeeze the heads out like toothpaste tubes for all that additional goodness.Stir fry veggies. \u00a0They do one with a vegetable like an endive. \u00a0With hot garlic...just the thing. \u00a0Crunchy with just that little spicy vegetal kick. \u00a0So good.",

    "text": "This place is really overrated and nothing to rave about. The food is about the average tze char place standard, or possibly slightly below that.It is also pricey to boot. We had the lotus seed duck (lian2 zi3 ya1) - an off menu item that the waitress kept pushing (saying it was very popular and tasty and only available on Friday to Sunday). When we ate the dish at the restaurant, we found that there was a lot of stuffing - lots of yam, chestnut, \u00a0carrots, leeks - and virtually no duck. When we brought the rest home we found more duck - but this shows that the serving style/orientation of the duck is poor and doesn't give you a good balance of duck and stuffing. And at $52 it was expensive too.The house tofu (zao1 pai2 dou4 fu4) was okay - the tofu was silky and smooth tofu but the sauce was a very pedestrian brown sauce. Since it is \"\u62db\u724c\" (\"house speciality\") tofu I was expecting much more.We also had champagne pork ribs, which were not very crispy. The sauce was uninspired, and the taste also didn't penetrate all the way through.Although the place was really crowded, the food still came very fast. So I suspect the kitchen was taking shortcuts, which might've explained the food quality.We were also seated in the overflow area - outside with no fans. Even in the evening it was very hot.Everything came up to $104, which was expensive for food that wasn't very good.",

History lesson a sentence: There was a very public family spat (between the siblings that ran the place), the restaurant was shuttered and put up for sale for $1.5m, nobody bought it, now it is open again, with the brother around, minus the sister ex-owner.I used to come by regularly for my \"zhi char\" fix and Teochew style dishes. This place is typically old skool and service is almost non-existent. Things are generally spartan on the inside, and you get a bit of AC, unless you're sitting outside next to the parking lot...They're famous for their seafood dishes, champagne pork ribs and steamed fish (fishes are displayed in the tanks and pricing is displayed on the wall) There are certain things that are off menu like the crayfish noodles (ee mee) and Orh Nee (\u828b\u6ce5, Teochew style yam paste) that has to be ordered a day or more in advance.Like all of the other places in Tiong Bahru, prices have increased a lot over the years and this place is no exception. 4-5 dishes shared between 4 people will run up a final check of 3 digits or more.Por Kee, I missed you. Love, not war! Otherwise, where will I find my only spot for \"Orh Nee\"?",

    "text": "Por Kee Eating House is located in the Tiong Bahru neighborhood. It is located in a small strip mall type setting. The restaurant itself is pretty small with only about seven tables or so inside, but there are many tables outside some of which spill into the parking lot.We went with some friends that live in Singapore and eat here on a somewhat regular basis so service was pretty good compared to what I've read elsewhere.The meal started with some peanuts, which were kind of oily.There were vegetables topped with crushed peanuts with a slight bit of chili but nothing overpowering.The fried tofu is one of the house specialties. The tofu was soft and creamy on the inside with a nice firm texture on the outside.The Calamari with Salted Egg crust was a favorite among the table, but I'm not a fan of salted eggs so this was one I personally did not enjoy.The Cereal Prawns are prawns that are lightly battered and then deep fried whole, with the shell and head on. It is then topped with a cereal mixture which is reminiscent of Captain Crunch. The cereal is very sweet, almost too much in that is sort of detracts from the taste of the prawns.The Steamed Fish is topped with cilantro and green onions in a soy sauce based sauce. The fish was nicely cooked and remained moist and tender. The fish is delicate in nature. This is a nice, clean dish which isn't very heavy.The Singapore Chili Crab was a large crab which was full of meat, especially the claws. The sauce is tomato based and was somewhat sweet and not at all hot. The dish is very messy, but what good food isn't? The dish comes with bread that is perfect for sopping up the sauce.The overall meal at Por Kee Eating House was very enjoyable. Most of the dishes were good, and I would come back if in the neighborhood.",

The chicken skin is roasted to perfection and it has a nice crunch into each bite. I would recommend an advance reservation with an early order of their chicken 1 day in advance.

After we eat Thai style fish hot pot (Sea bass or Soon Hock, etc. any fish can lah), request staff to bring 3 raw eggs, chopped green onion and cooked Indica rice. Then pour the rice in the pot, boil about 10 minutes. Once the rice become softer, add eggs and green onion, wait a few minutes then ready to eat. This way is Japanese traditional culture. Some staffs might reject to bring items for the porridge. Then try to request with Chinese language.",

We had friends visiting from oversea and had requested us to bring them for local eats at air-conditioned venue. Managed to secure a reservation, we went to check this place out. We were very pleased with the quantity and quality of the food. If you don't know what to order, try their house recommendations, you can't go too wrong...The must try this is the champagne pork ribs. \u00a0(You can choose the type of ribs you want). \u00a0We went home happy camper with the feast that we had there. It is a typical old school eating house and well, don't expect good customer service here. In fact, I feel that the people working there are like the food nazis that don't take nonsense from the customers.",

Anyway, I'm gonna do that and say that Por Kee is my favorite zi char place in Singapore.Their homemade beancurd is just Godlike. It is just one of the best tofu I've ever had in my life. Another famous dish is the Thai-style fish. The soup is very refreshing and you won't be able to stop drinking it. It's not overwhelmingly spicy nor garlicky, but it just struck the perfect balance to me.I also like their champagne ribs. You can get the individual portions which is 1 long rib per person, or the group version, where the ribs are chopped off to smaller pieces. Both are equally good.Don't forget to order dessert too. They serve killer mango pudding and yam paste.",

    "text": "Old school eatery that has been around for yonks, and I've patronised on and off through the years. Service is very fast - these auntie waitresses are the best. They are spot on in recommending dishes, and can be as accommodating or as huffy as the situation requires. We rocked up hungry at almost 11, and were not turned away. Score! Ordered up a serve of frog with spring onion, hot plate beancurd, vegetables and noodles, accompanied with tea and beer. This is probably my second time having frog, and I found it less weird than I'd imagined it to be - a cross between fish and chicken? Everything was pretty good, and had loads of wok hei. When the wait staff wanted to go home, they were kind enough not to chase us away. Instead, I was handed the bill, which I promptly settled, and then we were left there to our own devices. I thought this was pretty interesting, though it also meant that I could make off with the plates and bowls if I wanted to. I didn't though, and wonder if the resident rodents had a feast that night going through the leftovers. While I like Por Kee very much, the prices are often quite a deterrent - my dinner/supper cost me almost $70, which is a bit much for a zi char place.",

    "text": "COnstantly packed with not just locals, Por Kee can be rather intimidating. the quick service makes you feel like you are in the way if you are standing around waiting to get a table. However, this is as old-school as chinese restaurants will get especially in the eclectic quarters of Tiong Bahru. One thing that is still good is the champagne pork ribs, served by per pax portions. The fragrance of the ribs as you open up the foil will hit your nose and you will stare in gastronomical amazement at this lone piece of meat sitting on a plate in front of you. Don't wait further, just get into it. Hold it by the bone or use cutlery, it's your choice and no one will judge here.If you are not as lucky and the place is almost fully booked, you might be sitting outside on a warm and humid night as I did. Despite sweating slightly and looking less than glamorous, I gladly finished up the food on the table with a smile plastered on my face, thinking of the next dinner here with my champagne pork ribs.",

    "text": "decent food at this hidden-away sprawl of a cze char eatery in the newly-hipstered enclave that is tiong bahru. long before the fakely bespectacled, tight-trousered, coiffed hippied teenager took over the now cafe-belaboured estate of tiong bahru, places such as this one must have made the area's reputation as gastroterritory.this place is truly old-school: slightly cantankerous chinese-speaking staff, blue-white plastic dinnerware, and good food unpretentiously plated. the only caveat here is that while admittedly tasty, the food is a little on the rich + oily side - and I'm not one for fatty meats or oily vegetables (but you jolly well could be!)the restaurant enjoys fantastic business - table spills out from the main airconditioned eating house right out to the corridors of the adjoining building, and the open space next to a carpark; and every table was taken up. particularly surprising since it's not really along the main thoroughfare, but less curious given the standard of cooking.we had a teochew-style steamed fish; a glistening house-specialty of fatty champagne ribs; fried silky eggy tofu with mushrooms; and two plates of sauteed vegetables.the tofu was my favourite - it was so soft and silky in the centre, almost spilling out when you cut through the fried exterior. and that sauce with it, serious wok-hei yum with rice. I think the flavors were good, but the cooks have a terribly heavy hand with the oil. every dish was just a bit too oily, even the vegetables, which left you with a greasy feel on the mouth - rather off-putting to me. I'm a little fastidious about this - so everything ended up getting a dip through a bowl of hot tea.we'd return more frequently if the dishes were less oil-slippery, the meat less fatty - as it is, there are cze char places out there with a lighter hand in cooking, and similarly expert flavors. so, this place, I'm going to deem as divisive - I certainly can't begrudge the flavors here, and the cooking style could be right up your alley.reservations definitely needed, and it's a good place for family. if you find eating next to the carpark (with parking cars and the sometimes whiff of exhaust) uninteresting - make sure you let them know when you call.",
