    "text": "Kampong Bahru Road, Outram ParkI've written before about Outram Park in Singapore, where four quality cafes operate within a 10 minute walk of each other. Strangers Reunion is one of those cafes, and it doesn't disappoint. This is an interesting cafe, with a very distinct look and atmosphere, and most importantly, well crafted coffee.The espresso shot had a light mouthfeel, but a strong and robust flavour. It wasn't bitter or citrusy - the dominant flavour was woody and earthy. This is an interesting combination, and it worked for me. The crema on the shot was dark brown, and the volume was correct - this tells me that it's a shot made from fresh beans, extracted for the correct length of time. Bonus points for the friendly staff, who knew exactly what blend of beans were used, and were happy to talk coffee. This is great - I love seeing this in a cafe - staff who clearly love coffee too.I ordered a cappuccino too. This was smooth as silk, with soft foam, and steamed to perfection. The coffee flavour is slightly muted by the milk, but is still there - it's a good mix of taste and texture, and one of the better cappuccinos that I've had. There is an underlying sweetness also - this is from the lactose in the milk itself, and is brought out by steaming. More importantly, it is brought about by steaming at an appropriate temperature - it's a learned skill, and this tells me that this was an experienced barista. The foam layer was about right too - by no means was this one of the \"latte in disguise\" coffees that I've noticed in a few places lately. The overall aesthetic is quite distinct - I like the overall effect. The cement floor, rugs, subdued lighting and unique furniture ensure that Strangers has carved out it's own niche, distinguishing itself from any number of independent cafe's which have opened lately. I quite like that the cafe doubles as a gallery, supporting local artists - something that encourages repeat visits.Overall, this was a good coffee experience, and there is one more coffee place that I can add to the list of places that I would recommend to friends. What stands out for me were the staff, more than one of whom asked about the standard of coffee - this is a sign of staff who are engaged in what they are doing, and want to serve good shots. They did, and I'll be back for more.",

My coworkers and I ventured out to try this joint for lunch and not only was there a lack of any service, but our food was delivered one by one at a slow pace. While asking politely after 25 minutes of waiting, the \"owner\" or \"manager\" defended this piece of shit establishment by saying \"we only have a staff of 4\". I mean do you not have any common sense? It is the lunch rush and you have a staff of 4? Logistically, I am not in the F&B industry but I am pretty sure a moron can figure this out.On top of all of this, one of the orders was left out- which is another logistically error by not having the server repeat everything.Finally, the last straw- no remorse from the manager at all, then accusing us of ordering things that we never ordered, with no SORRY for the missed lunch for our co-worker, not even offered to knock off the pathetic 10% they call service.In the words of you Singaporean people... \"CHEAT MY MONEY!\"DO NOT EAT HERE.",

    "text": "A relatively new entry into the atas-coffee market, Strangers Reunion is a lovely mix of coffee, food, and rustic furniture. I appreciate that they open late (9am-10pm!) because this looks to be an excellent chillout spot after work.I won't comment on the coffee because I'm not much of a coffee person. I really enjoyed the lychee martini cake though I think the pulled pork sandwich (sio bak is not pulled pork!) needs some working on--it feels like it wants to be a version of banh mi, but what is hoisin sauce doing in there? I have great hopes for their noms though, it's not hard to see how dedicated they are to getting things just so. Like:-relaxed atmosphere, decor that feels light and whimsical (flowers in jam jars!)-dedication to quality: the oven is in use all day, for their cakes and breads-creativity! what attracted me to the lychee martini cake was the use of bubble tea \"tadpoles\" as a topping; it added a great texture, and the balance of sweetness and alcohol was great too-refills of water: water is delivered with the menus, and one of their staff comes by ever so often to keep the glasses topped up. Hurray!Dislike:-service needs to speed up--especially since it's the working crowd that is being served at lunch!-NETS and cash only--perhaps later?I think they're still working out the kinks--looking forward to a new fixture at lunch!",

Heard that the owner is a national barista champion, means to say the coffee he makes should be of excellent standard.The pastries and food found there are not of much variety but just enough to keep customers coming back for more. My favourite would have to be the waffles as it has the perfect combination of a crispy surface with a soft and fluffy middle. The mocha i tried was good as well, not very chocolaty but still alright for my taste buds.Service was very good, they made us feel at home and it was spot on. Overall i would come back for more lovely coffee and snacks.",

It was acceptable price-wise as well.A downer was the selection of cakes and desserts. Looked at the dessert fridge and I saw a whole cake (can't remember what it is now, didn't look very appetising, probably lime or something green), and a pathetic looking last-slice of red velvet looking sloppy and damaged... we gave them a skip. It was probably the time (6 pm), but shouldn't they have refreshed the cake spread already? Will be back for the coffee (and hopefully) cake as well!",

    "text": "Checked out Strangers' Reunion two Saturdays ago after attending the Singapore Blog Awards 2012 at the Singapore Flyer, together with @stooffi and another friend. I've heard so much about the place and we had some time to kill so we decided to pay the cafe a visit.So it is actually beside a big main road in a row of shophouses with a super eclectic mix of tenants.The cafe is actually a long rectangular space. When we stepped in the place was positively buzzing. I quite liked the decor up front though. Very typical of indie cafes, but its charming nonetheless. Coffees and teas are $3.5-$8. I heard the barista is quite well-known among the indie coffee scene.So what happened was that there were a few class gatherings just right beside us on the right that filled up the entire cafe with loud sounds. It was at least 15 people squeezed up against tiny tables just chattering in competing volumes. I had a iced latte once again, while my friend ordered a latte. Our friend had a sandwich which looked quite mediocre and tasted just so as well. For the coffee itself, I really cannot give it an accurate rating.What I can say was that the crowd and the noise actually drove us away and I was downing my iced latte like it was a glass of vodka cranberry. Perhaps the crowd took the word \"reunion\" quite literally and held their class reunions there.However I do see the potential in this place - if there are only a few human beings around. I can imagine it as a quiet cafe that will go perfectly with a book and some Olivia Ong.It being sufficiently close to Tanjong Pagar/Outram also makes it relatively easy to revisit.",

The place has been heavily pictured by bloggers around since it has a great rustic edge to its decor. Perfect for groups of 2-3 to head down since it is filled with random coffee tables. Best not to try big groups - that'll just spoil your experience.The menu options is pretty limited but it makes sense since they have only a tiny \"kitchen\", or rather counter space. I heard a lot about their buttermilk waffles so I decided to order them topped with greek yoghurt and fruit. I liked it enough to decide to come back again for you, so you definitely should give it a go.I also had a cup of their \"magic\" coffee. Checking up online, I learnt that it was made with 2 shots of ristretto so expect a rather strong drink balanced with nicely frothed milk. It had a familiar taste profile to Terra Firma of Loysels' Toy/Papa Pahelta fame but is bolder in execution. The cakes and pies aren't as exciting looking though. I'll give those a miss.Not too bad a place, was glad that it isn't as gimmicky as it could've been. Surprised that we could order from our table despite no service charge and service was friendly.

I ordered a flat white and a sandwich, my friend ordered the waffle. Coffee was definitely...better than starbucks and the sandwich was delish - I had the tandoori chicken sandwich, very generous portion of it.Really loved the cozy ambience, random pieces of vintage furniture, my favourite part of it was the fresh flowers on each table. Perfect!Only downside is the parking, you'll have to find a parallel parking space behind at kampung bahru road or park at everton park's hdb carpark, either way its abit of a walk on a hot day. But if you're taking the train, it's just across the road from outram mrt, just got to get to the cantonment exit!Final verdict: The name of the cafe is a mouthful as compared to the bland two-syllable \"starbucks\" but at least it puts its money where its mouth is - strangers basically reunite here time and again for the good coffee, food and ambience.",

However, the coffee is spot on. It's also due to the Papa Palheta beans and that the barista is the winner of the National Barista Championship.

My first time here I had a flat white with their house blend, and the second time I came i had a latte with their Axil beans. I prefer my coffee a bit more bold, and both coffees were bit too bright and acidic for me.What I like about this place though is the service and the ambience. Their waiters really do know their coffee, which is a pleasant change from your average cafe. One of the biggest allures to drinking coffee at an \"atas\" joint like this is the story behind the coffee. It's thus no surprise that their main customers base is the hipster crowd: expats and yuppies. The store has also done a good job of creating a nice modern space while still retaining the traditional feel of a shophouse.I may not come back for the coffee, but this joint is still a nice place to hang out with friends.",

But for the price and portion it's one of the better salads I've had here for sure. 3.75 for the flavors, 0.25 for the price and portion.Soy matcha latte ($5.90 + $0.60 for soy = $6.50 before GST++) - 4 starsPricey because it's small. Flavor was rich and good.I want to come back for the waffles and cakes! They offer a dinner menu after 6pm too. Open daily from 9am-10pm but closed on Tuesdays.",

    "text": "Strangers Reunion does offers some really good brunch dishes and unfrtonatley that means that on weekends there is really a rush here so the atmosphere is not the best to actually enjoy a nice weekend brunch. While the food is actually very good (I had excellent waffles and good eggs on toast) I always feel slightly rushed and stressed here. The service is very up and down here, sometimes it is totally absent, at other times almost rude and then times just confused (mixed up orders, not understanding the order). The food has however been very good and that is the reason I have returned. The coffee is clearly better than your average place but I believe it has slipped since I first visited in 2012 or so. They can still deliver some good cups but they are not as consistent as they used to be. Still a good place but not worth going out of your way to reach but if you are around it is good enough,",

Kampong Bahru Road seems to be the area to go with a couple of good coffee shops, at least according to Yelp's reviews. There was no lines when we arrived around 10:30 am and got seated right away. Coffee, I want Coffee...Magic ($5.50) - Double Ristretto + Milk (according to their menu is supposed to the the magic ratio of coffee and milk) was smooth, mellow but still balance and of course that lovely latte art..My sister which is not a coffee drink (why?!) opt for a Baby Chino ($3) which is steamed milk with foam and sprinkled with cocoa powder. The baby marsh mellow served on the side was just too cute. She also enjoyed her Apricot muffin ($4.50) which was moist and loaded with the fresh fruit.Too bad Ryan is not in the house, it would have been fun to see him in action. Strangers' Reunion has this rustic European vibe. A great place to chill and just have a cup of coffee. Or maybe next time I am in town, I would have one of their waffles!!",

On a side note, they recently started serving weekend brunch from 9am to 5pm.When I first saw the cup of cappuccino, I felt the cup looking strangely familiar (no pun intended)... Apparently, Papa Palheta and Loysel's Toy are sisters cafe which explains the similar looking cups. What then is there not to like about Strangers' Reunion? Coffee lovers should definitely pay this place a visit for the next caffeine fix.",

The service is quite poor, with no one tending to the tables in a logical fashion. I had to talk to the person at the register specifically to request a server and cutlery, which ultimately meant that person leaving the register to serve us. No one communicates with the runners, who walk to each table one by one with each dish in a hopeless search for the proper recipient. This is not a case of understaffing, but of poor organization and utilization of the staff. The food was decent, but overpriced. I tried the waffle with mixed berry compote and greek yogurt. The waffle was a little crispy and baked nicely. The toppings combined to form and very sweet and somewhat sour flavor. Overall, you can find much more pleasurable places to have a meal across all factors.",

Anyone's first trip to this place will start with looking weirdly at the sign thinking if this is Stranger's Reunion. On a Sunday afternoon, your chances of getting a seat is slim and when you do, you don't really want to stay long after you eat. Before I had a chance to order, I was served twice with delicious looking food that I of course did not order. As soon as I ordered, I was presented with a waffle that I did not order either. Seriously??Food wise, it was pretty good. I ordered their corn and zucchini fritters that came with spinach and a poach egg. The flavors were just right and portion reasonable for the price.So why not more stars? The ambiance were just rushed and unorganized for a cafe. While their food was good, it was not the best and with so many unique caf\u00e9s in Singapore, there really is no reason to come back here. Definitely not on a laid back Sunday.",

The coffee was good, the macha latte lacked flavor, and the spam fries were so-so. They were cut too big and we're not crunchy at all. It was like eating normal spam.",

    "text": "One of the first of the hipster cafes! This is practically an institution amongst the hipster crowd, methinks.I used to work across the road from this place and so it was the to-go whenever my colleagues and I felt like having something different from the usual hawker food in the area. It was also my source of comfort food/coffee in the early mornings, after working through the night. As such I have eaten here so many times that this review is going to be a bit too long...1. Coffee - I find the coffee here too acidic- from lattes to mochas to their famed \"magic\" (the first time a coworker asked me to help him order this I looked at him dubiously as though he was asking me to get him some drugs). Umm... good if you like your coffees sour but IMO Highlander's down the block is much better.2. Brunch - have never gone wrong with the brunch options here, your usual eggs-and-toast. Scrambled eggs were much better than the poached from what I remember. 3. Lunch - pastas are good, but get the truffle fries and the more special spam fries with lime kafir mayo to share! Spam fries are so so so sinful but go really well with the lime mayo - my ultimate comfort food after an overnight shift.4. Dinner - had beef tacos here a really long time ago which were MEH - dry, tasteless, bland, looks like it was put together in less than a minute. But I heard that they've changed their dinner menuBUT THE REAL GEM IN THIS PLACE ISWAFFLES! Their waffles look VERY typical and nothing too extraordinary but they are perfect! (Was not surprised when the folks here decided to open a waffle shop next door) Fluffy, light, not too dense- looks simple but tastes SO GOOD. In fact these are probably my favourite waffles in Singapore! If you only have space for one thing, get the waffles. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",
