    "text": "I decided to pick up a drink as my breakfast one morning before heading to Gleneagles. It was around 8.40am and the place was already busy and rather packed. Honestly, since my last visit to a Coffee Bean last year at Ion Orchard, this coffee & tea chain has fallen off my list of places I should visit. However, seemed like this Coffee Bean is the only one nearest to where I was. I was not prepared to walk over to the Starbucks at Wheelock Place and risk getting late for my appointment. So that day, Coffee Bean would do. My unhealthy breakfast (4/5)I ordered the Black Forest. I know this is not a Black Forest Cake. Unknown to many, I do enjoy a good Black Forest cake and it is one of my fav. Anyhow, when I looked at the menu board to decide what to order, that Black Forest was calling for me. I told the barista a little whipped cream please. The drink turned out to be good, there was even a cherry on the top of the drink. It tasted nothing like a Black Forest cake though.AMBIENCE (4/5)There was an outdoor seating here. The place seemed nice but was rather crowded on a weekday morning. SERVICE 4/5Staff was fine. This place seemed to be understaffed. The barista seemed to be working alone behind the counter. I almost jumped when he announced \"Black Forest\". It was kind of too loud and I was not sure if I like everyone in there to know I ordered a Black Forest that early in the morning :P",

I initially given it a higher rate but staffs gets into a fight and shouting match. Good thing the manager step in and asked his staff to go out but the reactions a bit slow..",

    "text": "Every single student seems to go to the extremely cramped Liat Starbucks to study. Why? It confuses me because down the road is The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at Forum. I really prefer CBTL's coffee and tea... Starbucks sucks. CBTL's earl grey tastes so much better... Also, it's empty - I was at Liat earlier and it was packed. Now I'm here at CBTL and it's empty! It's 24hours, no people, complimentary wifi and comfy couches - what's not to love?It can get crowded on the weekends though, but if you're looking for a late-night weekday studying spot - this is it. There's also hot food and pasta dishes which are quite nice. I'm not a big fan of their desserts however. I've tried their chocolate brownie (too dry!) and red velvet cake... neither of them are appealing. The carrot cake is passable.",

    "text": "Have been coming here to do my work since I was in college and I am surprised that till this day, it is still significantly less crowded than all the other coffee joints in the Orchard area. What I like about this place is that \u00a0it is always relatively quiet so you can concentrate on doing your work or having a chat with your friends. There is free wi-fi that can get a little slow but is still much stabler compared to the nonsense you get with wireless@sg. Expect their usual selection of teas, coffees, cakes and dishes -basic enough to satisfy your hunger/thirst woes but I must add that most of the cakes are little too dry for my liking.",

    "text": "This CBTL is in a pretty nice location and is 24 hours. A good option for students looking for a place to hit the books. Somewhat away from the busy parts of Orchard Road, it's considerably quieter at certain times of the day. In contrast, the Starbucks at Liat is crowded ALL THE TIME. However, this CBTL can still get crowded at the usual peak hours and on weekends. Coffee wise, I've always quite liked CBTL coffee. It's rarely ever burnt, in contrast to Starbucks coffee that is very often burnt. I'm referring to the brewed coffee, mainly. CBTL also has a better food menu, in my opinion. The caesar salad is really quite good.",
