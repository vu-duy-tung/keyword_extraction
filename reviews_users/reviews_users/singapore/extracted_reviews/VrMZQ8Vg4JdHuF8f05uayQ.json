On my third trip i was craving croissants which despite looking nice are awful. They taste like the recipe used oil instead of butter. I'd give anything in that display case a wide berth. We sat down to breakfast here today and while they had as many staff as they had customers no one seemed to be able to figure out how to serve anyone. The kitchen forgot our order twice, sent out the wrong thing an hour later and somehow re-made it in 10 minutes. Even by Singapore standards the service was exceptionally poor. There are so many great new bakeries in town now. I think it's time for this one to move on.",

Something about that just didn't seem to impress. However, their display of colourful and beautifully decorated desserts got me pretty excited the moment I stepped in. I was very impressed with the macaroons. The Rose flavoured macaroon was very impressive and one of the best i've had in Singapore. Its texture was just right, crisp on the outside yet soft on the inside, melting in my mouth. The flavour was pretty strong but not over powering. I also had the yuzu macaron which was rather unique.I tried their Passion cake, and liked the smooth velvety texture of the chocolate mousse that was infused with raspberries but found it a bit too heavy after a while. I had a flat white there and while it was not the best, it was pretty decent. Overall, I think they are pretty good for their macarons but do not set your expectations too high for their other offerings.",

    "text": "Everyone got very excited when Brunetti officially set foot into Singapore. And I got influenced too, especially since friends who've returned from Aussie kept selling it to me as if they've got a share invested. Perhaps it was the lack of Australian kangaroos or something, Brunetti was okay but it wasn't WOOTS. I like the layout of the place, it immediately leads your eyes to the vibrant display in the long counter. The coffee was good, the pastries were mostly fluffy and sweet, the gelato - don't bother, and service was decent. One negative was that there was no proper queue for ordering - you have to get the attention of the waiters behind counters yourself. So it might become a problem during peak hours - customers have to either 'target' waiters or hang around like a lost lamb. And short people might have to jump a bit.It was a cool and relaxing environment, sitting outside was very airy, pretty good for chatting with a group of friends or if you just want to quiet chillax by yourself.",

It's a combination of, pasty shop, gelato shop, coffee joint and sandwich bar all rolled into one. A lot about the outlet is very Melbourne-esque, from the pastries on display, to the coffee, to the ambience.My experience though, was a little hit and miss. Their lattes well good but the pastries were a little inconsistent. I was greeted by a wide selection of pastries and I settled for the Lemon Tart and New York Cheesecake. While I enjoyed the cheesecake, the lemon tart was disappointing.Despite this, I think I might be going back to give their breakfast a try sometime soon.",

When you walk in, the decor is casual and friendly, with a wide variety of delicious pastries and gelato laid out. Initially, one would think that it's purely a pastry place, unless one decides to consult the actual menu.They have an all-day breakfast, which I was pretty excited about. I ordered the eggs on toast (with salad and fries) and requested my eggs to be scrambled.The toast was excellent (I think it was wholemeal with olive oil drizzled on it), but the rest left much to be desired. The eggs were dry and tasteless (no salt/pepper/seasoning), and the salad was stale! Tables don't come with salt/pepper bottles so you have to request for them. The fries were good, not great. The portions were very generous and I left feeling full. However, the meal was definitely not worth the $10.90 I had to pay.I might come back just to try the desserts but not the food - the cannoli and macarons looked pretty good.",

The pastries reminded me of Italy, a variety of tiny biscuits and mouthwatering pastries were on display and it was difficult to pick which to buy. The gelato however, was a lot less inspiring. The names were fancy but the way the server described it, it sounded like they simply mixed delicious foods into an ice-cream base, such as Ferrero Rocher for the hazelnut chocolate. Perhaps it was the way he had described it that made it sound extremely uncreative, but as it was closing time and he seemed rather impatient, I decided to just order two scoops for the sake of it. The pastries were variably good and not very memorable, but it was much better than the gelato that I ordered. I've definitely tasted far better gelato in Singapore and I regretted my choice instantly. Next time I'm in the area, I will probably be back to try more of their pastries to be able to get a better gauge, and sit down and have a drink.",
