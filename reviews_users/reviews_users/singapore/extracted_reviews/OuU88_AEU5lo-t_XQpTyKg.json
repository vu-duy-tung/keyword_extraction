We sar their for an hour just to finish our tea.",

We ordered:* Spaghetti with Prawn in Tomyam coconut sauce - I thought this kinda sound strange but there were more than 2 reviewers who mentioned it as good so I thought we'll try. My gut was right, the sauce was coconut-y and Tomyam-y but the concoction just doesn't kick it. Sad \u00a0* Olive Rice - after a long wait, we hungrily ate it up and liked it. * Mixed Grill - this was great. The chicken and beef slices were nicely charred with right amount of BBQ taste. The sotong was also done just nicely without making it into rubber. Unlikely to return as the wait doesn't warrant the taste of food.",

    "text": "A Steaming Pot of GoodnessBangkok Jam has been one of my preferred \"commercial\" Thai restaurants to visit but it's been a while since I was back. We happened to be looking around for dinner at Plaza Singapura when we stumbled upon their Steamboat Buffet! Being an avid fan of steamboats and having the Gf suddenly agreeable too (she's not a big fan of steamboat), I had to take the chance to give t a try and I had no regrets. Soup BaseUnlike other steamboat speciality restaurants, there isn't anything overly fancy about their soup based here. No laksa, collagen or magic dust, just a simple selection of chicken, pork, red Tom yum or clear Tom yum. We decided on the clear Tom yum since, according to them, was the less spicier option. It was a really good soup base. Fragrant, sour, sweet, without being overly spicy, it tasted like a really heart warming bowl on Tom yum soup, which was refreshing as compared to some other places that use Tom yum stock cubes. The Ingredients Don't expect an extremely wide variety of ingredients here too. There's enough to keep you satisfied but there isn't the usual suspects like hot dogs and luncheon meats and in terms of seafood, there's only the option of baby octopuses, Cuttlefish and Dory. The soup does come with 3 fairly large prawns though, which was a bit of a bonus. What they do have here may be limited but very good ingredients. The pork and beef were good and the beef and pork balls were good too. There's also the option of stick noodles (those used thai boat noodles) and glass noodles, which made the whole experience very thai. Plus PointsThe free flow drinks. They don't believe in charging you for soft drinks or water. Instead, they've included a free flow of ice lemon tea, lemongrass tea and the ever popular thai iced tea. They do have desserts available but that's at a separate charge though. OverallDefinitely worth the try. What they lack in quantity they certainly make up with quality and if you like yourself a nice boiling pot of good Tom yum than this it definitely your cup or pot of tea.",

    "text": "I would NOT recommend Bangkok Jam. I came here with my friend and we both eat a lot so we decided to order three dishes between us. Each dish costs between $10-$18. The drinks are all about $5-$6 and dessert, (for example mango sticky rice) was about $9. The portions were really small and disappointing. We expected much larger portions for the price we paid. The food tasted good simply because Thai food is amazing but nothing special compared to other Thai restaurants in Singapore. The service wasn't particularly good either. In summary, Bangkok Jam is overpriced for what it is. The portions are small, the food is nothing special and the restaurant isn't high end. If you are looking for good Thai food, look elsewhere. You can order much more food or go to a higher end for the same price as dishes here. We ended up paying $30 each for 3 dishes to share with rice. We didn't even order drinks or dessert.",

Our usual Thai hangout is either Sabai, or Folks Collective, so that should give you an idea of our benchmark.Food was ok. How badly can you screw up a coconut curry and meat dish?It wasn't good value either. The portions were what you'd expect in Thailand, and the salt and oil were probably what you'd expect in Singapore! Too much!It's a decent effort, but half-hearted, and wasteful at best.The service was ok. Our mango salad was serves way too sour and the mango was too raw. My Aunty (who loves Thai food) couldn't even eat it, and we asked to change to another dish, and was not charged. Not bad, but that kind of thing seems the norm at this place. Subpar food with cheesy decor.I'd spend my money at Sabai and Folks Collective.....or cook Thai better anyday!Don't bother with this place.",

    "text": "I'm about as badass as a napping puppy. \u00a0So coming into this restaurant and being seated at the edge of a balcony overlooking the other floors of Plaza Singapura, I had high expectations for my meal to be quite the thrilling experience.I mean, the name of this restaurant is called Bangkok Jam. \u00a0That sounds pretty intense, already. \u00a0And the decor is adorable: full of traffic signs, stoplights, telephone poles and wires, Metro/MRT maps, and street lamps. \u00a0Even before ordering, I was already starting to get an adrenaline rush after being reminded of the anxiety that is Los Angeles traffic.Now, I don't know why people have been complaining about poor service--it must have been early growing pains. \u00a0We were seated promptly, received our menus quickly, and were served drinks rather rapidly as well. \u00a0The staff was attentive, but not bothersome. \u00a0If anything, the staff and their service helped assuage any anxiety I was feeling from my fear of heights. \u00a0One of the people at a neighboring table even changed her order after picking at her food, and their server was still very accommodating.I had gone with my roommate, who ordered their seafood pad thai. \u00a0I ordered their egg noodle with bacon and crab pieces (didn't know that was a Thai dish o.O), which was marked as a special in their menu. \u00a0It seemed that we didn't receive a large portion for the amount we each paid (S$11.90), but upon mixing the noodles, the food seemed to expand and it looked like we were both going to be satiated as opposed to slightly-less-than-famished.Her dish had a hint of smoke, which tasted good, although not very Thai authentic. \u00a0She said she really enjoyed it, but had had better Thai food before.I, on the other hand, had no idea what a ride I was in for.While I agreed with my roommate that my dish didn't taste very Thai authentic, initial impressions had me puzzled as to what it actually did taste like: \u00a0It didn't taste like either crab or bacon, but rather, just egg noodles. \u00a0It did taste good, but wasn't too much different than any other fried noodles found at a Hawker center. \u00a0Where was the thrilling experience everything had been leading up to?Then, I spied a tiny cup with Thai chili oil and lime(?) juice that came with my noodles. \u00a0Feeling courageous (or badass, if you will), I poured it in and mixed my noodles thoroughly. \u00a0My roommate had a bite of mine and said it tasted good, so I got a huge forkful of noodles and eagerly shoved it in my mouth.And immediately screamed.Not loudly enough to make our neighbors turn, though. \u00a0They seemed to be thoroughly enjoying scarfing down their noodles and the changed order.My roommate looked at me, alarmed. \u00a0She knew I was a chronic victim of wasabi/chili overdose, and thought I had poured the spicy oil with a little too much gusto. \u00a0When she asked me what was wrong, I could barely answer.Not because the food was spicy. \u00a0But because I had accidentally eaten an ENTIRE raw garlic clove that had somehow stowed away in my bite of noodles. \u00a0And because I was, at the moment, quickly dying.I scarfed down my noodles to chase the garlic I had just ingested. \u00a0And then half a liter of water. \u00a0People must have thought this was the first meal I had eaten in a month, with the speed at which I was eating. \u00a0Unfortunately, since my taste buds had been sufficiently obliterated by that shocker of a first bite, I could only taste garlic afterwards. \u00a0I can only presume that the dish tasted better with the oil mixed in, since everything usually tastes better with more fat. \u00a0(Cue Paula Deen.)Bangkok Jam was definitely a... rigorous experience. \u00a0I just wish the chef would dice his aromatics more finely. \u00a0Now excuse me as I look for an army of vampires to slay with my breath.",

Waited past 30 mins before asking one of the waiters to check on our food and he didn't even get back to us so we had to go to the manager before they decided to rush our orders out instantly.. Weird huh? Tom Yum soup was too sour, mangoes were too sour. Their greed curry and fried rice are acceptable, still edible.. What killed them was the service. Moreover there were lots of waiters running around so I doubt they were short handed as the restaurant wasn't even full of people. Won't be going back there anytime soon.",
