Boutique - Great Japanese brands, mostly for men. \u00a0Bought a few things, decent options and easy to chat with staff. \u00a0Great way kill time while waiting for a table. \u00a0Bar - Friendly (and skilled) bartender, tasty tasty drinks. 2nd favorite cocktail bar in Singapore (Tippling Club reigns as #1, no surprise there). \u00a0The bad: Cafe - Food has taken a nosedive since opening. Change in chef/recipe? \u00a0Something is off, because before it was the best eggs benedict and now it's just average. Tiramisu is to die for, literally. \u00a0Gave me and my friend a stomach ache. Always crowded, so be prepared to wait.Boutique - Would love more options/sizes. Bar - A bit too congested and pricey. Need cheap/beer options. \u00a0Haven't been in awhile, I hope they added a free/self serve water option because it wasn't there before. \u00a0The ugly: If the drop in food quality is any indication, this could be one of those great venues that gets popular and forgets about the little things that made it so. I'm optimistic though because it seems that the staff actually cares.",

    "text": "OMG love the drinks here. Its one of those, don't have a menu but tell me what you want type of speakeasy-ish bars. while the decor isn't that of a speakeasy - the drinks are the classy types that reminds you of one. Try to go early on a random week day to get a seat at the bar, so you can see the amount of care and skill that goes into each drink. I love watching the mixologist (okay, NOT just \"bartenders\", but this is some classy stuff - so \"mixologists\" it is) going at it with each drink, pounding away on the berries/cucumbers for super fresh flavors, slapping the mint (NOT just ripping it up like how ppl usually do, but SLAPPING it), and lighting up rosemary on fire for extra flavoring and a show. drinks are amazing here - the only time i've had to have something re-done was for Maison's version of a bloody mary, it wasn't that it was bad, but it was just too spicy. overall - i always have a great time here, chill vibe, classy music and decor, and most importantly, each drink makes me feel so special. It's a big plus that the mixologists are super nice and friendly, chats away with you and explains things to you if you are curious. you must hit up this place if you are in town.",

It almost had a nutty flavor. I'm guessing it's the way they roast the beans. \u00a0They also are hitting on the trend of offering a ton of different coffee preparation styles: French press, vacuum, whatever. \u00a0C's coffee was superb. \u00a0The only downside to this fabulous little eatery is that we felt bad holding the table so we quickly sipped our coffee and skedaddled. \u00a0I'm totally going back next weekend.",

Maison Ikkoku is somewhere I come on each visit to Singapore - whether it be for the downstairs cafe with their gorgeous coffee or the upstairs rooftop bar with one of my favourite views in the city. I've even picked up a beautiful tie for my other half in the swanky and uber sartorial men's boutique in between.

It serves pretty good coffee that will work well with most palettes. You can try most of the popular beans you will probably need to try at this spot. If you are down on a hot day, I will recommend their cold drip or iced long black (skip the syrup please!) They have really good desserts to accompany the coffee so you may like to leave some space for your sweet tooth when you're down.A winner on their menu is their MI Spam Misubi which is a dish brought forward by one of the co-owner days in Haiwaii. It is really addictive sushi made up of long-grain rice and a piece of spam (luncheon meat) on top.I love their apparel store as it features male clothes from Japan, London etc. Very edgy range with a nice attention to details.",

They have a great ambience and your tables are made out of old recycled doors or cupboard doors. Old shelves are also nailed to the celing, giving a vey odd impression that they are falling through the ceiling somehow!The coffee here is fantastic. I always order the latte, or the MI Signature latte. They use a fragrant blend of beans that I can enjoy without sugar. For those who aren't crazy about coffee, you can also order the chai tea, which I find good, but a little too sweet for my palate.The cakes here are also worth mentioning. My favourites were the pumpkin cheese cake, which was light and not too heavy, and the red velvet cake topped with cream cheese icing, walnuts and comes in a gloriously large slice.They have great sandwiches here at affordable rates. I found them so big, a friend and I could share one. They use good, freshly baked bread, and quality ingredients for their sandwiches.I've also tried the eggs benedict on their weekend brunch menu, and enjoyed it. I will definitely head back to try their other coffees and dishes!It's mostly street parking around here, so good luck at peak hours! This area is also notorious for the summons people loitering about and giving tickets, so it's best not to risk an illegal park. There is also a wait list for tables sometimes, especially on weekends, but I've not had to wait for more than 15 minutes before.",

The stuff you get from Starbucks, Coffee Connoisseur, Tea Leaf & Bean and similar is junk. Usually watery, tepid, and bitter. Mostly, I got comfortable with the kopi houses all over singapore for my caffeine fix. It's a very different kind of drink, but once you get used to it, I found it to be a better option than the other coffee available.Anyway, back to Maison Ikkuku. This is the place I visit on the weekend, when I want to have a real coffee. Fresh ground beans, well roasted, and made properly with a decent espresso machine operated by people that know what they're doing. Best coffee I've had in Singapore. I gave it 4 stars, because even though it's the best, it's not comparable to what's available in Melbourne.",

    "text": "We came here for brunch on the weekend (had a 1pm reservation for 4)...it was crowded and a bit cramped, especially since we were sitting at the table by the door. There's a bit of self-service...you have to go to the counter to order and pour your own water, but they do bring you your food and are pretty attentive about taking finished plates away since there was barely enough space on the table (made from recycling old doors). My husband and I ordered the smoked salmon scrambled (mainly for the guacamole that came with it) and the French toast with caramelized bananas. Both were good...not to die for but definitely good. For the first time in Singapore, I had a version of spam musubi with REAL SPAM...at $3, it was a bit overpriced for its small size, but it satisfied my craving (the few places that sold musubi used generic spam). My caramel latte was much better than I expected...not too sweet but the coffee was strong and flavorful -- definitely not your average brucnh latte. Our friends ordered a side of potatoes and it was a lot smaller than we expected -- it came in the same sauce-like container the guacamole came in...it made the musubi for $3 look like a good deal haha. Two of us ordered the specialty coffee drinks and although they were good, they weren't as unique tasting as my latte.Overall, this place is cute (including the street it's on) and the food won't disappoint.",

Check out my post here with my photos of all the different cocktails we had, we had flaming bananas, fruit & herb cocktails, cocktails with berries, cocktails with sorbet in them, a Jalape\u00f1o sour which was spicy!

It's probably the only place of its kind in that enclave. I was looking for a good coffee boost but didn't want to have turkish coffee so my friend brought me to this place, it's along the row of shophouses just opposite the malay heritage centre. It's got a very welcoming cozy vibe - the kind that invites you to just hang out here for hours. I ordered an iced latte (loved how it was served in a generous portion of a jar!) and had a red velvet. Indeed I got the coffee boost I wanted and more! The coffee was beautifully prepared, with alot of love. The red velvet was a nice accompaniment though it was quite a huge slice that I couldn't finish it.Haven't been to the other floors of this place but definitely have become enough of a fan of the cafe to check the rest of the place out!Final verdict: A good break from middle eastern food and atmosphere of arab st!",

Great aesthetics link all three floors, and it's one place I can actually can get something (read: spend money) on every floor.On the ground, the cafe serves up some serious coffee - manager Rizuan roasts the beans himself, and the baristas all have experience. Get Welly to pour you a signature MI Latte - he's pretty good. Heck, even the chef's a bit of a barista himself! Oh and the food's pretty good too. Try the weekend brunches. Or grab a musubi if you're in a hurry (spam on sushi rice? yeah.)Second level houses a menswear boutique. Cult brands, decent selection. I've been making eyes at some Miansai accessories for ages... picked up some Twins for Peace shoes instead. #firstworldproblemsTop floor is a boutique cocktail bar. Now if you remember a mixologist called Leslie who used to be at another bar a couple streets away... I found him. He's a smooth operator, and he's got a wealth of experience. Test him for as much as your cocktail's worth.",

    "text": "There's a stark contrast between old and new taking place in Maison Ikkoku. On a quiet side street, the calm of a quiet Saturday afternoon is broken by the hum of conversation and the hiss of milk being steamed under pressure. The painted brick walls with industrial style copper pipes and light fixtures are far removed from the original shophouse that was here, and are closer to a contemporary urban studio apartment. There are some quirky touches also, with old pieces of furniture suspended from the walls, and doors recycled into tables on an outdoor terrace.An espresso shot is the foundation of many different coffees. It's hard to make a bad drink with a good espresso, and so much easier to make a bad drink with an over extracted shot. The espresso shot that I ordered arrived with a medium dark brown crema, and a small volume of coffee. (The crema colour is an indicator of freshness. If it's pale, it's stale, which is why I always make a note of this. The small volume suggests that the shot was not over extracted, which would give rise to unpleasant flavours in the shot, as non soluble coffee grounds end up in the cup). It was bitter, with hints of woody flavours, and a slightly thick mouthfeel. The aftertaste was bold and lasting - overall a well executed espresso. So far, so good. I ordered a latte also. The espresso was definitely muted by the milk. It was smooth, with the coffee flavour not lost or drowned out by the milk. However, the overall quality is reduced by the presence of larger bubbles in the milk foam - this is something that I have seen before in Maison Ikkoku. This might seem like the most minor and insignificant point imaginable, but there are valid underlying reasons for pointing this out. Larger bubbles do not impart the same silky smooth mouthfeel that microfoam does. Also, the baristas have gone to the effort of creating latte art. Unfortunately, larger bubbles cause the foam to break apart, so the overall affect is lost after a few minutes. This is something that is fixable, and it's a shame to see their efforts go to waste for the sake of a small change to the steaming technique. It's also the difference between a very good latte, and an average one. One thing to bear in mind however - the point above is simply not relevant for anyone who prefers drip or brewed coffee, and might not even be an issue for anyone else. \u00a0There is also a good selection of brewed and drip coffees available for anyone with different tastes. Pourover coffees are on the menu, along with cold dripped, syphon, aeropress, andV60 all available as options. Coffee choices include pretty much everything except ristretto shots. That's ok though, there's more than enough on offer. One thing that Maison Ikkoku does well is the pairing of different bean types to different brewing methods, and the baristas are well versed in which method to pair to which bean. This is great to see, and speaks volumes about the cafe, and the owners intentions and reasons for starting. Prices as are expected - $8.50 for the latte and cappuccino above - and broadly in line with what is charged in other quality cafes. Along with Smitten and Chye Seng Huat Hardware, Maison Ikkoku has a very well stocked retail section, with accessories that are not always found elsewhere. There is a good selection of items for brewed or filtered coffees, including Chemex and V60 coffee drippers, cone filters and syphons. There are also tampers on sale for home baristas. Unfortunately, Maison Ikkoku does not sell coffee beans. This is something that I would like to see happen, as there are some interesting blends and single origins \u00a0from Columbia and El Salvador being used. Overall, 4 stars, as the selection of brewing methods available, and the quality of espresso, makes up for the steaming issue described above (which will not affect everyone), but it's unfortunate to see this when everything else is done so well. Also, Maison Ikkoku can be very crowded at weekends, with queues for seats - opening the second floor cocktail bar during the day would help to alleviate this. It's certainly worth a visit, and along with Symmetry and EspressoLab, is a good choice for anyone craving caffeine in the Arab Street area.",

We nabbed a cozy spot next to the door, with sofas and our back to the wall panelling. It was a pretty interesting place as we had the privilege of looking at the types of people walking in the door. My keen eye spotted a socket plug at our table, and immediately started charging my phone.Coffee was excellent while the Lady Lemon cake that we ordered looks tasty but fell flat to our expectations. They have other cake selections on display as well but the selection/names didn't catch my attention.The staff/service is highly commendable. Even though we were seated near the door, the cashier took note of our departure and bid us adieu.Would definitely be back here again!Tips:- Our seat had 2 socket plugs so internet/phone junkies would love this spot to recharge your phone- Don't sit outside unless you are sure that the people at the table next to yours are not going to smoke.- If you prefer a cooler, air-conditioned experience, it is better if you take a seat further into the cafe.",

Besides the good food, the coffee here is exceptional. The staff do their best and it's situated in a wonderful area in Singapore, full of culture and atmosphere.

Taking a stroll within the compound after your coffee break at Maison Ikkoku is as simple as walking across. Worth coming here during a lazy afternoon.

However, we were quite lucky - there's still a table for two that's only reserved for 1pm. Since we weren't planning on chatting or taking our sweet time there, we promised we would be in and out before then.I immediately zero-ed in on the Smoked Salmon Omelette ($18), mainly for the chunky guac side, while my sister got Croque Madame ($15)I was pleasantly surprised by the portion. The food itself was also enjoyable, although I preferred my omelette to be a little less done. I also enjoyed the side salad with roasted almonds and lemony olive oil(?) dressing.At Maison Ikkoku, you place the order yourself at the cashier and get your own iced water and condiments. They don't charge service charge because of this. While I was ordering at the cashier, I spotted a Spam Musubi ($3) on their counter and decided to give it a try as well.Spam Musubi is one of the best things that came out of hawaii, imo (And maybe Ryan Higa :P) Maison Ikkoku's spam musubi? Yum! I enjoyed the seasoned rice and it's pretty cheap for the size. I think it's pretty hard to mess this one up anyway.",

    "text": "Ikkoku definitely has national-best-worthy potential along all the dimensions it offers - coffee, food, cocktails. Enough skill to be worthy of 5*. I'm docking one for high prices and their inability to keep up service quality when the place is full. And somewhat because the location is annoying to get to, as well as being quite nice. None of these (except lack of scalability) is worthy of a star by itself but they add up.The coffee is very, very good. In fact I used to trek there to get my beans because they get the roast amongst the most \"right\" of all the roasters in Singapore. It's a light roast of single origins with very nutty tones (think Colombian) which is perfect for long drinks. Price is in line with hipster coffee places at 7 for a cold drip.The food is best defined as quality tiny portions at exorbitant prices. 18++ for a bit of cheese and 6 crackers is ridiculous! But it's a hip place, the customer base is probably trying to keep under their calorie limits... I try to eat before going there even though it's pretty good stuff. The cocktails are precise and well balanced. What I wonder is how much of that is bartender skill and how much is recipes and good quality control? Nothing wrong with the latter but the prices seem to be marked up to levels implying the former. If Ah Sam can offer bespoke cocktails AND chuck 3 attempts down the drain before offering you something they're happy with, for only 23++, the more than 30 charged by Ikkoku is a bit ridiculous. It's also worth noting that you take a risk by letting them go wild, occasionally you get a dud (our berry mojito was not that different from a dragonfruit flavour vitaminwater) - but that's part of the game. No risk no gain. I do wonder what the ice is made of. The smell of the water from the melting ice definitely reminded me of MacRitchie reservoir. Again, at that price point I'd expect using something other than tap water in delicately balanced cocktails (or at least filter it). What annoyed me is that I once asked for a variation on a classic cocktail (instead of sticking with giving them a mood and getting something \"created\") and they made a bit of a fuss about it, implying I didn't trust them or something. On the contrary, a true artist works best within constraints (cf what Helmut Newton's \"victims\" said of sessions with him, which were dictatorial). A classic sour, for example, is all about balancing the sour, sweet and booze taste-wise and texturally, the egg white (which they did impeccably). A sazerac is the hardest of all as too much absinthe results in basically an aniseed short drink, and too little and you have something resembling an Old Fashioned. The location is alright, sandwiched between shophouses and with a magnificent view from the garden over the Sultan Mosque which has just been renovated. Bit far from public transport by foot.On a normal (i.e. not full) day, the prices are somewhat justified by the competent and personalized service and peaceful interior. Then we made the mistake of coming on the Chillax anniversary night where something like 500 Amex card holders poured onto a small number of bars to test the resilience and scalability of the teams on duty that night. Once we got there and somehow secured a table, the team cranked up the music to painful levels (to stop people lingering and clear space for more of the mobs?) so much so that we on outside tables kept closing the door to try and preserve our eardrums. It then took them 10 minutes to take our order and around 1h10 to deliver the cocktails. This is the downside of hand crafting every order, scalability is almost impossible. We moved on to Auld Alliance which had no issue with the Chillax crowds, thanks to having both ample amounts of staff at hand and serving whisky instead of cocktails, which take less effort to serve. If Chillax had been my only experience of Ikkoku, I'd never come back.The thing is, at this price point, I don't bother going to Ikkoku anymore anyway. Sure it's good, but the stack of small risks and issues just make it hard to find the willpower to make the effort, particularly if the night will be crowded. There's plenty of competition in town...",

Slightly off the beaten track, with warm orange lighting and chilled-out tunes in the background, it calls for a nice lazy afternoon with a cup of well-brewed coffee...and maybe some cake if i had my way.I tried their Pumpkin Cheesecake and was pretty impressed on my first taste of it. I could taste the pumpkin though the cheese and the nutty crust. Brilliant! It was however a little too heavy for me towards the end. Well, that's partially my fault for being too greedy anyway. Their coffee was pretty good! Smooth and velvety, just what I needed for a rainy afternoon. I went up to the roof top bar to have a look but it was closed in the day. Perhaps this place beckons for another visit at night.",

It's quite the climb - but it's worth it. Once you get up, the view is amazing - of the beautiful Sultan Mosque, with the glittering gold domes, and with a few drinks, you almost feel like you're not in Singapore anymore - I almost feel like I'm Istanbul, looking out. The ambiance is chic, the tables outside on the deck are my fave, but the ones inside are nice if you want air-conditioning.MUST HAVES: The Smoked Goose. OMG. I can't even describe this. The drinks are amazing. I think they have a menu - but I always just tell the waiter what I feel like having, \"Something not too sweet, refreshing and strong\", and they'll whip up something for you. Makes it kinda exciting.Their drinks are visually orgasmic - with very elaborate designs, and very artistic interpretations of the traditional cocktail.I had like 8-10 drinks there last Friday, and had a blast. Go with friends and enjoy the hipster-chic-Arab Street.What I don't love: Drink are $22-$25 a pop - so, errr, yeah.",

    "text": "All the drinks are pricey...even with the HH list (attached) of $18 drinks. What a steal. (Sense the dripping sarcasm?)Haji Lane is a must for locals and tourists alike. It's known as the \"heart\" of boutique shopping in the Muslim Quarter. But after a few shops down everything starts to blend in. Expensive, wooden panelling, and chic. Not really our fashion vibe. So we turned to the cool libations and food spots here. There were cafes and restaurants open while we window shopped, but even more exciting are the second-story \"hidden\" bars.Maison Ikkoku was the first second-story bar we visited in Haji Lane that day. We were the first ones inside around 5PM. And luckily it was HAPPY HOUR! I guess Singapore has a different idea of happy hour, because drinks were a hefty $18. I got the Passion Thymes (gin+vodka, passionfruit, thyme, lemon) while my sis got the Moscow Mule. I loved my sweet drink--I got it because of the passionfruit, but it is on the sweet side. Thank goodness for the thyme, which balances it out. The mule was smoky because of the garnish he torched, however it was a refreshing mule...just like all other mules. They were delicious, so say the least. But after one, I wouldn't want to order another round because that'd be almost $40 for two drinks per person?! Like are you kidding me!! This isn't Bayfront or MBS...I don't understand. Affordability would be so much more welcoming, especially to tourists.However, service by our cocktail connoisseur was great. He made the drinks in a much more timely manner compared to the guys at Bar Stories, but he wasn't as warm or talkative. It seemed like he knew we would just get one round of drinks and peace out because HELL-O it's freakin' expensive! Can't blame me for that.I'd definitely come back here again for their libations. They aren't snobby about their drinks and they definitely don't take 30 minutes to make you a sipper. Their bar space is beautiful and airy, which is hard to achieve given how small the upstairs space really is.",

    "text": "As far as surprise dinners go, this was a success. The surprise was meant for my husband, but never having been to FORT it was for me, too, in a way. I liked the fact that you drive up the hill (Fort Canning Park) not really knowing where you end up. It is beautiful up there and the Pinacoteque de Paris is a wonderful example of a heritage building.We walked around for what seemed like ages not finding any signs whatsoever and then called the restaurant to ask for guidance. As they were not allowed to put up any signs outside: Just walk into the building and look for black signage, the entrance to the restaurant is quite inconspicuous and the place is really small.Really small. Looking at the photos I would have imagined some kind of \"room\", with space for tables, but literally all it is is a large, rectangular bar, \"divided\" by a ceiling-to-floor crimson curtain, the chef at one end of the room in his small sushi kitchen and some hipster lighting (exposed filament bulbs). A nice touch is the small terrace outside you can use for a smoke or just getting some (warmer) air, where you can also follow the action of the \"Shakespeare in the Park\"-show drawing to a close (depending on the hour of course).The welcome was very friendly and the seating at the bar quite ok despite the chairs not being too comfy. We ordered water and were asked, when opting for cocktails, what our go-to drinks usually were. As this is a bespoke bar, the mixologist would prepare something that should then come close to your favourite drink, using homemade infusions and literally \"mixing it up\" a bit. So he did!My husband received a great alternative to his beloved Negroni, with Earl Grey-infused Gin, and I loved the new take on my Manhattan. For dinner we went with the 12-course Omakase, which had started right away and I can only say that we enjoyed each course immensely. Our mixologist Matteo - also the only staff on duty that evening apart from the chef - explained each course to us, and also suggested how to eat it - e.g. how to mix the flavours on the plate for a truly delectably experience. Very fresh ingredients and lovingly prepared.Portions are however on the small side (which is to be expected from a 12 course meal) and we did feel quite hungry still, having some food at home later on - although this might have had to to with our alcohol intake as well ;-)All in all we had a lovely evening, and would readily visit FORT (and Matteo) again!",

Nice touch.Location is awesome, cool points for date nights or to impress people from out of town....I'm coming back as I have a queue of visitors coming through.

The menu sees a line up of bespoke cocktails alongside pretty plates of mod Japanese food, and the entire concept is developed by the familiar Ethan Leslie Leong, who is both the Executive Chef and Master MixologistMuch thought has gone into the cocktail pairing multi-sensory dining experience at FORT by MI. Expect to be surprised by the changing scents, textures, sounds, flavors, and techniques showcased in the food and tipples preparation. It's a F&B lab with the -insert chemical process here- processes going on right before our eyes. Some highlights from the a la carte dishes here. The Sea ($38) is a pretty sashimi platter which layers on Hokkaido Scallop, Irish Oyster, Seaweed, Ikura, Tobiko and Ebiko on a bed of sea salted ice. It's gorgeous, but the overall flavor was a little too salty for me with all that roe, and it got fishy as well. The Nest ($28) is such a festive plate! Doesn't it remind of Easter? Think of this as a western chawanmushi which combines hot melted Mozzarella and \u00a0Parmiagiano-Reggiano with free-range chicken eggs. Not a fan of the smoked hay (it smelled like gym socks), but I guess that adds to the overall rustic appeal of the fish. A mod sushi roll which is quite fiery is the Spicy Maguro Hand-roll, The Fort [4 pcs $18 (4pcs)/ $28 (8pcs)]. The heat comes from a special Asian chili sauce added to the minced tuna, which was a bit mushy but the overall bite was quite shiok. To end off the dinner, the delicious Martell Cordon Bleu Lavender Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Silky custard infused with the subtle lavender and a buttery caramel cognac. End the night perfectly with The Snowman, a concoction of spice rum with buttered popcorn, hazelnut and milk, which is another dessert in a cup! I'm definitely coming back for the super affordable 12-course Omakase for just $68/pax. Ethan definitely has many more tricks up his sleeves! Bespoke cocktails are priced at $18, and infusion shots at $10.",

It's a great place for first dates -- yes if you're a teenager or in your early 20s -- cos it's cheap ($68 plus for dinner omakase). Honestly, it's NOT an omakase dinner (it demeans and disrespects the word \"omakase\"), it is not sophisticated, service is patchy at best, drinks are mediocre, and if you're a real foodie, have been to a number of decent restaurants, you'll know what I mean. Whatever seating you go for -- the earlier dinner or later service -- means you eat with everybody else -- they serve everybody all at once the same course. So, yeah I was starving by 9.15pm and finally the first dish was served. All dishes were what you'd expect an 18 year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with. The dishes, mostly Japanese inspired, were ok at best and some were quite laughable. Just imagine a run of the mill Japanese chain restaurant in Singapore, and whatever they have on the menu -- just itemized into very small portions -- and you get to try -- about 8, 10 dishes? That's your dinner at fort. Cocktails are made a la Bar Stories: what do you like? Sour? Ok, so it's \u00a0some vodka kiwi Yuzu concoction. Nothing like Bar stories. Unsophisticated. Wait staff varies. None were rude, but obviously that's not an acceptable baseline. One of the waitresses serving us couldn't enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes. Obviously won't return. You've been warned.",

Perhaps the hipster have already left the area for cooler places but the popularity of Maison Ikkoku seems to still remain. They do coffee, cocktails and food. The coffee is surprisingly good, I was a bit skeptic after looking at them make it as it appeared I got a new employee trying to learn how to make coffee but it the Kenyan coffee came out clean and crisp. Perhaps lucky that I ordered it as an Aeropress as it is one of the more forgiving brew methods.They offer an extensive food menu where a lot of the items are fairly pricey but everything I have had here has however been very good and the cheese and garlic bagel is both good and good value but it appears to be a seasonal dish so try it now. The handcrafted cocktails are also good but a bit pricier than other as good places in Singapore. A general issue for both coffee and cocktails is the slow service. They are very friendly but even when it is almost empty it can take a very long time to even be able to place an order and even longer to get it brought to the table. If they would up the service a little bit I would change the rating to a four without a doubt.",

The staff was confused as what to do. Someone said we needed to wait downstairs but we were were sent upstairs by another staff member. The 12 courses were being rushed out. They took 30 seconds to eat but took another 10 minutes at least for the next course. And the food was not even close to being worth the price of over $200 for 2.
