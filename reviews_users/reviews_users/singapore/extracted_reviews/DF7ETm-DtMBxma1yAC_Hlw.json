Syrup wasn't too sweet. The lotus seed and gingko were cooked till soft but not too mushy. I highly recommend you to visit this stall as such traditional bean curd is a rare find nowadays.",

    "text": "So I've been going to this eating place quite frequently these days. It is quite accessible from my home either by bus or car (duh!). Parking can be quite a pain in the ass especially on weekends, and sometimes even on weekdays too (dinner time). Anyway, moving on! Personally, to be honest, IMHO, the best prawn hokkian mee is located here! You could easily tell by the ridiculous queue most of the time! However, it is pretty efficient because the staff would ask about your order and get it done while you're still in line, the next thing you know, BAM, your hokkian mee is done! I'd suggest to always order the $5 one in medium portion even when you're alone. The smallest size ($4) plate simply isn't worth it. The next best thing I found here, that is less mainstream is large steamed fish head in black bean sauce ($15) with rice. They put a lot of ginger in it (which is my fave)! The fish is always fresh with soft texture, accompanied with tons of bones! Must slowly eat! I also tried fried yong tau foo! I tried about 5 different kinds: (Not sure about the names but I'll try to describe it)1. Fried yam in orangish color (meh!)2. Flat keropok in yellow color with some prawns (meh!)3. Ngoh hiang (yay!)4. Fried fish cake in tofu skin (yay!)5. You tiao stuffed with fish (between meh and yay)Drinks?Grass jelly jumbo size please!!!Note:I heard good things about the porridge stall located near the hokkian mee and they have salmon porridge! The nasi lemak stall located at the corner seems to always have a long line too! I'll probably go try it next time...I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "This is not my usual haunt as it is not that easy to get here unless you drive or live nearby. The place is quite airy, even when seated inside, thanks to its high ceiling and plentiful fans around. Besides the popular duck rice/porridge stall (near the rojak place), and Hoover rojak, it also houses the corner fish steamboat stall at the back. We shared the rojak which was really good with plenty of crushed peanuts and sauce. I had the Teochew Beef Noodles which was not very nice. Maybe I was expecting smooth silky thin kway teow like Hock Lam, so this version was the thick sticky kway teow which stuck together. The uncle was very nice though. I love the coffee at Seletar Coffee (facing the car park), near the Chinese dessert stall. It was thick and milky. And it was cheap when compared to other places. I heard it used to be 50 cents but the price has since increased. Still, for 2 small cups of coffee and an iced coffee, it was under $2.50. Where else can you get such prices?

    "text": "Thanks to Nik T. for introducing this hawker to us!My husband and I frequent this place for dinner on the weekend, as it's a nice walk from our apartment and it's easy on our wallet. This place is legit Singaporean realness because every time we go the locals are always here in full force, which makes seating a bit of a challenge. Thanks to Nik T.'s suggestion, my husband is ALL OVER the $8 oyster omelette at Ah Hock Fried Oyster, stall #54. I'm a fan of the seafood fried rice, but at this moment I'm not sure what the stall number is... will have to get back to you on that. It's served with pickled jalapeno on the side, and if I weren't already married, it would've been my next choice for a future life partner. I'm also a fan of the hokkien mee. Again, I forgot the stall number, but it's one of those stalls that always has a line so it's not hard to miss. And the chicken wings in stall #76! Those are always a good time.Add my favorite sugar cane juice with the above dishes, and all is well with the world. Guess I need to head back again so I can verify the stall numbers and lead you all in the right direction. ;)",

    "text": "Thankfully our taxi driver recommended this to us when we asked for some good street food. Although again, not the easiest to get to with the MRT. We had to take a bus transfer, but thanks to the kindness of strangers, we managed to find it perfectly due to their instruction. Plenty of open (and closed stalls), and a lot of them sell the same or similar items, so you just have to choose which one to go to. I tended towards the stalls with longer lines in hopes that also meant delicious food. I got a yummy and cheap wonton noodle soup and a beer, while my friend ordered a Singapore chicken rice and a lo po gao. All so very delicious. The dessert stalls were a bit lacking, but we managed to find one where I ordered a black rice pudding. Delicious and not overly sweet. Thank you, taxi driver! P.S. You have to pay to use the bathrooms, bring your own tp, and don't forget the water to wash the waste!",

They have for instance, a good nasi lemak stall and pretty famous hokkien mee and wonton mee stalls. A great place to have a sampling of local dishes, and the general Singaporean vibe of the place adds to the authenticity of the experience. Forget Newton Circus - Whampoa isn't that far off, and the prices are far more reasonable with equally delicious food to boot.",

    "text": "Whampoa Makan Place is located just off Balestier road on Whampoa Drive. They offer a big variety of different food. My personal favourite would be the wontan noodle store, which so far has been my favourite place to lunch in all Balestier. It only costs 3 dollars, is clean and quick to deliver. This is a typical hawker centre, you will find many tables all squashed into a space that so many tables shouldn't be able to physically fit in, but I guess the set up works for everyone. The cleanliness is not the best you will find, though there are many cleaners constantly working at maintaining the cleanliness of the hawker centre, the place never seems to be kept clean! Rubbish sprayed all over the place, tissues and wrappers you will find on tables and the floor. This is a practical place to have a quick and cheap meal, no room for comfort here.",

    "text": "There are two blocks of food stalls that make up Whampoa Hawker Centre (Whampoa Makan Place is a new name they slapped on the hawker centre after they renovated the place). Roughly defined, block 91 (opposite the wet market) is the breakfast block while Block 90 is the lunch/dinner block.The variety of food across the two blocks is large and there are a lot of popular stalls with food that is well worth the calories. At the breakfast block there are two linked stalls that sell noodles in the morning, close in the afternoon to prepare for their dinner business, and open in the evening to sell a very popular fish head steamboat. The original Loy Kee Chicken Rice is also at this block, and is near the corner where you can get really good Tau Huay that is made using traditional methods.The lunch/dinner blocks has even more hits. Singapore Friend Hokkien Mee, Hoover Rojak, the duck rice/porridge stalls, Ah Hock Fried Oyster Omelette, chicken wings, the nasi padang stall in the centre, etc.Basically, it's got what every good hawker centre has--great food at low prices.Don't mind the mess too much. Sometimes the cleaners take a while to get to all the tables. But you can help by not making too much of a mess.",
