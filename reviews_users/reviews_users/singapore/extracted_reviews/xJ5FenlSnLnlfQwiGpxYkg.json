    "text": "The dimsum here is finely crafted, and we were a party of two on a Saturday lunch.Upon knowing that we were two, they kindly offered to make all three-item dimsum to be two-items for us instead (prices are also 2/3 of menu price accordingly). I felt this was a great touch as we could order a lot more things.I particularly liked the abalone (~$60). Soft, tender, chewy. Yum. This place is nice, yet doesn't really break the bank. Upon knowing it was a birthday of my friend, they gave us some longevity buns. Nice service, great food. Would return! P.S. if you pay by chope vouchers online, they have a 10% discount.",

The prawns with wasabi were on point. The Mango deseet was nothing special, but the Egg Yolk Custard Buns were special.Topped off by impeccable service and daylight robbery prices - would absolutely recommend.",

The dim sum menu is short but has many innovative dishes, like squid ink dumplings. No major creation in the \u00e0 la carte menu, but even simple dishes like fried rice (we had the 8 treasures variety) and crispy chicken are prepared with refinement. Service is courteous, but not terribly pro-active.",

    "text": "I had the first of what will no doubt be many multi-course Chinese dinners for Chinese new year, at Summer Palace. This is an excellent, value-for-money Cantonese stalwart that has been around for years. I'm not sure why people would classify the restaurant as pricey when given the quality of the food, portions, decor and service, it really is the farthest thing from pricey. If one refers to the absolute price of the food, I think its a foregone conclusion when eating fine dining anything. Unless you catch your own abalone and other treasures yourself I guess... Anyway if that prevailing view works in my favor i.e. less people fighting for good seats in the house, I'm all ears :PWe had one of the set menu's (can't remember if it was peony or jade or something) and extended it to 8 people and swapped one of the dishes. It worked out to about $110 per person and we got:- suckling pig AND roast duck for starters- a brimming bowl of treasures each (diced abalone, ham etc soup with a very generous chunk of bird's nest on top)- broccoli with plump and juicy scallops kissed by XO and dried scallops- the best salted egg yolk prawns with asparagus - crunchy and rich without being overwhelming- a very fresh and large steam soon hock- light, but flavorful glutinous rice...annnnd nian gao + one of those light herbal jelly/aloe vera type desserts to finish the feast. That's quite hard to beat. Barring some annoying tables nearby that were a tad loud, we had a very enjoyable meal and service was unobtrusive.",

    "text": "Summer Palace is where you come to have high end Cantonese food. We made a reservation for two on a weekday and when we arrived, the attendant promptly ushered us to a window seat facing out into the Regent's swimming pool. We ordered the set meal at $62++ per person (minimum two persons) and was treated to a 6 course dinner. The menu included the typical cold plate for starters, birdnest soup with crab meat and dried scallop, veal meat, fish, lobster noodles and a light dessert of 3 tasting items. I have nothing bad to say about the food. The seafood was fresh, veal meat was tender and the birdnest just melted in my mouth! Love every bite of everything. Portion was just nice for us, if not a bit too much. They also have dim sum in the afternoon, for those who want some Chinese afternoon tea.Service was excellent. While it is a Chinese restaurant, they assigned an English speaking staff to us without prompting - most likely because we made our reservations in English and they took note. When they saw my bags, they immediately offer a small stool for me to put them down. Everything was thought for and done without any prompting from us. The dishes were served at a good pace so that you don't feel too rushed nor too impatient waiting for the next dish. An overall excellent experience indeed.",

Even the chicken feet, which I usually swear off, smelled and looked to appetising to pass up! Their Homemade Beancurd with Fish Fillet, Fish Gluten and Vegetables sounded super simple, but it was the BEST I've ever had! The beancurd is perfect - soft and smooth inside, and slightly rough on the outside, and the fish fillet was tender, soft and fresh. Wow!Will be back next time (hopefully soon!) and try the rest of the dishes that we didn't see on the menu!",
