However, eating Fei Fei before it became famous, I can say that the standard has dropped. Nonetheless, if you dislike black sauce wanton mee like I do then this is excellent. I would load up on the chilli though. The ordering Aunty is a boss! Go straight to her, be clear and don't hesitate. None of that standing there and deciding while ordering please. The drinks guys are super clueless expect to get your drink orders wrong. Go for the extra wantons (fried and soup) and put them under your noodles before you begin. By the time you are ready for them, they would have soaked up all that lovey fatty sauce. Chilli saucr refills are diy..be proactive about it.",

    "text": "Talking about Wanton Mee, Fei Fei Wanton Mee is probably one of the top few Wanton Mee chains that will come across your mind when we talk about Wanton Noodles in Singapore. With its branches, though its available in the West, we still find it best to visit its pioneer's branch.Having ordered the fried meat ball as a side. I find that this is rather addictive and special. Minced meat has been mixed with chinese parsley, onions and chopped carrots. If you like meatballs and dont mind chinese parsley, this is a good finger food option.Fried Meat Balls \u00a0- $5While many have feedback that their standard of food quality had dropped, I find that their noodles still stand up. With a spoonful of chilli sitting by the side of those pale noodles, the first thing that came into my mind was its spicy level.Noodles and Chilli - $5 (Big)Tossing the mee with the spoonful of chilli, you will realize that the ingredients are all hidden under the noodles, with lean slices of Char Siew meat reveal and wanton. Not to worry about having dry noodles as the pork lard oil and soy sauce had given a smooth consistency to the noodles.For non-spicy lovers, you can opt for your spoonful of black sauce for your noodles. Likewise the ingredients were all under the pile of noodles.Noodle with Black Sauce - $5 (Big)Shrimp dumplings soup was nothing out of the ordinary and it would not give you the temptation to make a return visit for it.Drumpling Soup - $5No doubt its exterior is soft and smooth, filled with minced meat and shrimps, it still lacked the ommph and crunchy bites from chestnut. Still not the best I have eaten so far.After paying this famous Wanton Mee place, I find that it's nothing much as I still personally prefer's Pontian's to this!",

    "text": "I bought the $5 bowl of wanton noodles (large) and it was quite a lot of noodles in there. I should have stuck to the small version. The dry version reminded me of the old National Library food center's wanton noodles. It looked plain, with just a spoonful of chili sauce to mix and coat the noodles. One spoonful was not enough for the large bowl of noodles so I did not really get to taste the chili or detect any spiciness at all. Instead the noodles was mostly flavored by the oil (from pork lard or others I could not tell). The noodles was bone dry and could use some help from the soup which was not served. I did not ask for the soup too. The ingredients (wanton, fried wanton, char siew and veggies) were underneath the noodles and were quite puny. I think $5 just meant more noodles and maybe the addition of fried wantons if the small did not have that. The wantons were very salty though the meat inside was tasty. Fried wantons were better. The char siew was dry. I had better elsewhere. The noodles were ordinary, then again maybe I prefer the Cantonese style of egg noodles and not this fatter version. I will not make a special trip for this but I will not mind it if I am in the area. But being in Joo Chiat, there are so many other good food around so this may be low in my list. Oh and the coffee served was awful. Very acidic and sour, maybe the coffee powder was old or used many times.",

Share it with a friend and add some mayo!The wanton mee is really different from what you get at a typical hawker centre where it is soaked with the sauces or chilli and you add green chilli and mix it all together. Over here, the noodles are plain i.e. as plain as it gets after soaking it in boiling water. The fried and boiled wanton are surreptitiously hidden under the noodles so you got to dig in to find em. I don't really like the charsiew (roast pork) here anyway as it it's quite tasteless and sliced too thinly. I don't really like the charsiew that is dyed bright red in color anyway as I prefer the slightly burnt-roasted kind which has a juicy taste and is rich in flavor.The soup, which you must ask for separately is just normal.",

I have to say, although it's good... I wouldn't call myself a big fan. There's just something about it that isn't quite 'right on the money' for me. That being said, it is a very popular joint and when business is at it's peak for the stall you might have to wait a good twenty minutes till you get your meal. I'm not saying the food is bad or anything like that... it sure is decent, but I wouldn't want to travel across the island to have it. \u00a0From time to time, when I'm in the area, I do enjoy a bowl of Fei Fei Wanton mee, if you have a bowl, be sure to have it 'dry' and with chilli. Their chilli sauce is pretty unique and compliments the flavour well. Normally, I'd ask for an extra serving of chilli. Something to note, there is another Fei Fei Wanton Mee 24 hrs right across the street from this one that's open 24 hours a day. Do not go to that one. I had it twice thinking it was going to taste the same but nope, not even close!",

Needless to say, the wanton mee served was great tasting, chewy noodles and decent wanton. Prices start from 3 dollars for a small bowl, to 4 dollars for the larger portion. Aside from wanton noodles, they do sell fried yong tau foo and dumplings in soup as well. Service was extremely fast. Once you have ordered and paid at the counter, you will be given a number tag to place on our table. The noodles would always all arrive within 5 minutes at the same time. Yes, you heard it right, all orders arriving at the same time. What is unique about Fei Fei is that unlike standard wanton noodles, their wanton, char siew (roast pork) and vegetables are found below the noodles. It is probably a habit of the cook to place them in first, but I find that it is especially helpful to make lazy eaters mix their noodles with chili properly. Speaking of chili (which could help a SIngapore hawker succeed), Fei Fei's chili sauce is remarkably good and spicy. The kick of spiciness makes one go for a second portion with added chili. One improvement for Fei Fei would be that they would definitely do better if they improved on their char siew and wanton texture. They were average at best and the overall dish was saved by the chewy noodles and spicy chili sauce.",

The food isn't anywhere near bad but it is really hardly spectacular - so if you do go, bring low expectations.The one part of the dish I did like was that the cook got the noodles just right - what many would term as QQ or in more universal terms, springy. Other than that, the wantons were forgettable and the soup tasteless unless you count saltiness as a flavour. Stole a bite from my friend's chicken noodles and it was miles better, so perhaps that would be a better bet.Some of my friends who stay in the east tell me people have waited up to 20 minutes for their order when the place is packed. No way. I give it a 'yes' only if you are in the area late at night and the noodles take no longer than 5 mins to be served up.",

I'm rather neutral, leaning towards dislike territory, although it may be due to said parents who always do takeaway wanton mee, and having the noodles solidify into a packet shape as a result of a lack of moisture. That said, this Fei Fei outlet is perhaps the original. I remember when the current owner's dad himself used to man the stall, scalding and tossing the noodles with much expertise. Today, the noodles don't serve to inspire very much. On bad days, they can be overcooked, char siew too dry, and wantons way too salty. The otah, on the other hand, is worth making a trip down for. Generous in serve, meaty and spicy, it's a real pleasure and almost worth the hassle of a trip down. Then again, I think these babies are factory made. Until Fei Fei can recreate the experience of my childhood, I will always retain a feeling of meh with regards to wanton noodle. Please, Fei Fei, inspire me again!",
