    "text": "At the risk of giving away my age, I have to say I am nostalgic for those days when No Signboard Seafood was still a stall at Tekka Market...when orders for crabs were taken early in the day, hours before we actually arrive. Numbers were then given out with each order until the crabs run out. Our crabs would be waiting for us in numbered pails, we would indicate to the stall owners that we have arrived and the crabs were then cooked for us. Their chilli crabs were unforgettable, its accompanying gravy such a flavorsome delight that won them many fans over the years. When No Signboard Seafood relocated to Geylang, we followed but it was wonderful to come across this branch at Vivo City last month. We ordered the Chilli Crab obviously. \u00a0All those years of eating their crabs in open air, it was very pleasant enjoying them in air-conditioned comfort for a change. The crab arrived, swimming in the same mouthwatering thick eggy garlicky, tomatoey \u00a0chilli gravy that hit the perfect combination of savory, sweet and spicy deliciousness. If you love the moreish salty denseness of crab roe, you can ask for female crabs whose roe pair so beautifully with the chilli gravy. \u00a0Additionally place an order for their steamed or fried Chinese buns (man tous) to soak up more of this yummy sauce. As we noticed that the White Pepper Crab is also their signature dish, we ordered one to try. It was tasty and aromatic saut\u00e9ed with ginger, lots of scallions and garlic. An edge of spiciness was detected through the liberal use of ground white pepper. \u00a0It still packed a punch but failed to sway me from the black pepper camp. Two other dishes - Deep Fried Baby Squid covered in a sticky sweet piquant coating and Saut\u00e9ed Chinese Spinach (yin choy) in Broth with goji berries completed our meal. Both dishes were also perfectly executed leading to the end of a very satisfying meal. Glad to see an old favorite in a new location. Will drop in again if I am ever in the vinicity.",

This place just feels like a tourist trap...I really don't like wait staff trying to push me to order something crazily expensive with shark fin or what not.. I know what I want and the only reason I am here is for the Chili Crab..Chili Crab here definitely not cheap, but I find the sauce deliciously good.... sweet and with just a hint of spiciness and so thick and sinfully tasty. I can eat the sauce alone with buns or rice..Stir Fried Vegetable with garlic is standard... at least I don't feel too guilty just eating the crab..I doubt I would come back to No Signboard for a repeat visit. * The huge patio in the front is amazing nice with a great view of the harbour!",

Bamboo garlic clams were wonderful, But a good chili crab is an easy find in Singapore, and the service is extremely slow, understaffed and in-attentive. I actually saw 2 tables leave before even getting water. I was lucky enough to order as soon as I was sat nd ordered a pitcher of beer so I didn't need attending to, though it did take three attempts to get a glass of water and it sat empty the rest of the night. Add on the stupid charges for Everything (surprised there wasn't a surcharge for the salt and pepper shakers on the table and for each plate), and the fact that it is expensive, and it all falls kind of flat. Next time heading to Long beach.",

The place was fairly busy and despite the somewhat expensive menu, seemed family friend (read: lots of kids). The menu seemed 'standard Asian', there was nothing about the place that seemed special.I ordered the white pepper crab and a side of veggies to share with my boyfriend. The side of veggies (well, veggie, because we were asked to choose one vegetable that we would like) was pretty standard, but came out a good 20 minutes before our crab. The crab itself was good, nothing to rave about though. I felt a little silly in such a seemily fancy restaurant wearing a bib.The service was really quite average. I understand it can be difficult to manage groups of 10 in a busy restaurant, but I felt they didn't even try. It took a long time before anyone came to even get a drinks order from us, and was even more difficult to get anyone's attention for refills throughout the night.We didn't walk away full, but the food wasn't really anything to complain about. I wouldn't return there next time I was in Singapore though.",
