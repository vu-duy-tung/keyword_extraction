    "text": "I have to say Antoinette is my favorite place for cakes or tea sessions in Singapore. I always wanted to visit Antoinette at this location but it is kind of out of way from where I frequent when I am in Singapore. The day before I am flying out, I decided I must trek my way here. Like what another yelper has mentioned, this location is a bit of a walk from Lavender station (subway/mrt). Saw the Antoinette logo from afar. The tea salon is somewhat out of place among whatever is in the area. AMBIENCE 5/5 The d\u00e9cor speaks elegance, refined and beautiful. \u00a0This is what I love about Antoinette, the salon was what I envisioned if I ever owned a tea salon. I have no talent in baking or running a f&b business, so I just have to be a customer ;) The place was supposedly to be calm and quiet, except that this party of 8 at a table nearby was yapping oh so loudly. FOOD 5/5I ordered the La Rose cake which comprises of grand cru chocolate mousse, caramel, almond nougatine, cocoa sponge, grand marnier and dark chocolate chantilly. The description for the cake stated \"exotic caramel\". Not sure what so exotic about the caramel. However, one thing for sure, the cake tasted absolutely lovely. It was so aesthetically pleasing on the outside, tasted heavenly inside as well. Chocolate lovers would adore this cake. I am not a chocolate lover, I too love this pretty cake. The Antoinette's iced chocolate was not sweet enough. It was a blessing in disguise since a sweeter iced chocolate may be a bit much with the chocolatey La Rose cake. On other occasions, I may want a sweeter iced chocolate. SERVICE 4/5Staffs were friendly, cheery and polite. Not sure if they understaffed, kind of hard to holler down a staff to take order and to get a check. Also, this location does not serve my favorite French toast all day like the one located at Mandarin Gallery @Orchard.Still, I recommend anyone to visit this location and hopefully they would not run into the same party who was basically a nuisance to other patrons who just want to relax in a quiet and relaxing place.",

Although we had decided our orders, there was problems regarding our order of drinks, as well as serving of the food. We had ordered a certain dish which the opposite table also ordered, but they were served first. Suspected that the young server had forgotten about our order, as the dish only turned up when we reminded him. We feedback to the cashier about the issue who gave a reason that the other table had ordered the dish in advance which was highly unlikely as we distinct heard the other table asking if that particular dish was available during ordering. He was quite a blur one who did not serve the dish with cutlery or water and we had to remind him a number of times.Hakka Gnocchi ($24++)dried shrimp, foie gras, cured pork, morelThe serving was quite small. The gnocchi were quite colourful, chewy and went quite well with the minced savoury topping.XXXL Nasi Lemak Burger ($20++) XXXL Chicken, first marinated and then coated with Chef Pang's favourite batter that reminds him of the fried chicken he had at school canteen when he was young. The exterior is incredibly crispy, with a juicy and succulent chicken breast within. Promising a spicy kick, the homemade otah is made with fresh mackerel and prawn. The aromatic sambal, a requisite ingredient in any traditional nasi-lemak offering, is a blend of chilli, dried shrimps, shallots and only gula Melaka was used for a subtle sweetness and the aromatic finish. Upping the nostalgia factor is the luncheon meal.The dish finally arrived after a long wait, after finding the opposite table having it first before us. The rice was fragrant and moist. The sambal was delicious spicy sweet. But the fried chicken was disappointingly dry.Orient ($9++)white lotus seed mousse, coconut cake, salted peanut sesame praline and a flowy salted egg cremeuxThe salted egg cremeux reminded one of liu sha pau. The most interesting part was the crunchy salted peanut sesame praline right at the bottom.Iced Lychee Orange Tea ($7++)The young server told us it was unavailable but a check with the counter it was available. refreshing drink.Antoinette's Hot Chocolate ($7++)vanilla perfumed hot chocolateOrdered it as my first 2 choices of Peach Melba Tea ($9++) and Camouflage Matcha Cafe Latte ($7.50++) were not available. The drink was rich and more on the bitter side.",

I went there on Valentine 's Day it was surprisingly not too crowded and there had special desserts made for Valentine's. One was the bear - it was all sold out though and the other was the rose. I picked that one - it was really delicious. The other one that I liked was the monotone early grey - it was visually appealing and very tasty! I tried three other desserts - loved each one's intricate flavor! I will have to visit the one in Orchard next time!",

    "text": "I came with high expectations, and was again, mostly disappointed. Salted egg yolk croissant!!!! The pictures, are to-die-for. The actual product is just alright. The croissant is excellent! But the highlight, salted egg yolk sauce, although runny, was only found in the center third of the croissant. The sauce itself, was also more sweet than salty and had a kind of dessert taste to it. My sister liked her french toast, for me, it is very weird that there is ham and cheese in the the french toast drizzled with syrup. Service is chaotic, to say the least, in Antoinette. The take away/cashier area is always flooded with customers.. And the poor service personnel is overwhelmed and can't get handle all the take away orders and bill payments. The crowd began almost around 11am, and luckily my sister and I arrived just 10 minutes before that. Seems like after 11am, most customers had made reservations. The order staff was flustered, and rather rude when handling my requests. You had to wave at many servers before you were acknowledged. I got the sesame macaroon to go and my sister got the grand cru macaroon. The macaroons melted really quickly. so be careful if you buy it as a gift, it might get melted before you get to give your gift! I might come back for a croissant or macaroon to go, but just that.. Maybe it would be a cute place to hang out in the afternoon, when the place is hopefully less crowded.",

    "text": "If all the oozing of the Salted Yolk Lava Croissants haven't flowed to your taste buds yet, wait till you hear this: Savory croissants with LOCAL flavors have officially hit the island now, thanks to Chef Pang Kok Keong from Antoinette. Now how about some Chili Crab Croissant and Scallion Arlette. A play on Singapore's famous chili crabs with fried \u9945\u982d (Man Tou), Chef Pang has perfected a droolicious Chili Crab Croissant ($7.50). The sweetness of real crab meat in sweet and spicy flavors is a perfect match to the crisp buttery croissant layers. The level of spice is mild, yet sufficient to linger after the last bite. This tummy is crabby happy with this heartily-filled crescent.Who would have imagined a plain Jane to explode in flavors? The Scallion Arlette ($3.50), a French interpretation of the traditional \u8525\u6cb9\u9905 (Chong You Bing), was surprising in flavors and textures. With fragrant spring onions and creamy butter in the croissant dough, Scallion Arlette is a savory crunchy addiction without a hint of oiliness (unlike the traditional sort). It takes a lot of will power to stop munching this $3.50 a pop goodness.Made fresh daily in limited quantities, the Chili Crab Croissant and Scallion Arlette are available now at the Penhas outlet at 11am every weekday and 10am every weekend, and at Mandarin Gallery and Sofitel outlets at 12pm.For all the sweet tooth out there, here's a thumbs up! Chef Pang has more sweet croissants in the mix now. Smoky Salted Caramel, intense Matcha Croissant for the everything-matcha zen-ness, savory Quatre Fromage for the cheese fans (like who doesn't love cheese?!), or the Kaya Croissant for the traditional nostalgia? Go get your 3 course croissant meal now.",

    "text": "Saw the chef featured on the news talking about their innovative desserts so had to give it a try since I'm in town. The environment is cozy and relaxed but the service was super slow and a little unorganized. We tried four cakes, three out of the four were very chocolate driven, more on the mousse/ ganache side. The Orient was the only one that had a different taste profile than the others. The first bite was gentle to the palate and had a good balance of flavor and textures however the excitement dissipated after each bite. The macarons however are excellent, the shells are well made and the flavors of the fillings are balanced. I liked how they had raspberry jam filling with the earl grey milk chocolate ganache. Overall- the macaroons are good - cakes are okay but definitely overpriced so be prepared to splurge a bit and don't have your hopes too high.",

Love the crispy biscuit base. The milk chocolate was a little on the sweet side. I would love the cake more if it is dark chocolate, but that's probably just the old taste buds in me not liking sweet things.

    "text": "I picked the Gnocchi for my main course. Gnocchi is an italian-style dumpling made of the usual ingredients in dough but with the addition of potato and cheese to give a softer, fluffier texture. The tomato-based sauce was the usual classic sort and there's a carbonara version of this dish. This is definitely for the carbo-junkie or just pick this one to share between friends.My friend had a Pancakes with bacon and Mushroom Ragout. The mushroom cream sauce is a personal favourite and I always have it with breakfast options. I loved the pancakes the first round I tried it because they had a slightly crusty exterior with amazingly fluffy inside but a second trip found me really disappointing ones. So I'm not too sure if quality is consistent.We also got the Salted Caramel Religieuse which was made up of two choux pastries and buttercream. It was decent pastry but rather unmemorable.Having a cake in its namesake, Antoinette, this must be the star of the dessert selection. If you're wondering what the bubble sitting on the top of the cake is - it's a raspberry coulis that you can burst to get raspberry sauce all over your cake. (Oddest sensation ever doing that.) That table ooh-ed over the lusciousness of the chocolate mousse base and the thick raspberry sauce.We also had the Nougatine which is one caramel lovers should have to polish up their meal. I can't remember what exactly went inside it but it was just a little pretty pot of caramel goodness.Oh, and as a personal recommendation, pack some of their Almond Croissants back home. The buttery goodness topped with endless amounts of crumbed almonds and custardy almond paste filling is entirely comforting to have at home.",

We've tried many great brunch restaurants in New York and Los Angeles, but for some reason this place by far beats any we've been. Either Singaporeans dont' know food or they probably assume western cities would have better. We always order Salted Caramel French Toast and Classic Eggs Benedict- and it's perfect for two to share. The French toast is soaked in caramel and eggs to perfection, and has the softest, richest cream ever! \u00a0Eggs Benedict is done perfectly with the rich sauce, cured ham, and eggs that pop one you dive in to get your slice.The interior decor is girly French, or vintage French. Another reason to love this place and it would be perfect place for girlfriends to hang out, except that I see as many guys eating here together as I see girls. Service is sub par as it is with any restaurants in Singapore.",

After I ordered a cake and I asked for a glass of warm water and it was only served 10min later after asking it for twice. If the 3 waitresses are busy and hence delay the service which is forgivable but all I saw was 3 waitresses look a bit lost and don't know what they are doing, walking up and down for nothing. I think the service could be improved.",

Getting their attention was next to impossible with only the restaurant a third to capacity. The decor was very quaint with a French feel though with a tad too much of a feminine touch to it.However service aside, if you can tolerate the service, the food was good. The pancakes I had \u00a0was delicious. It was soft and fluffy with very generous serving of cream. The presentation could also do a bit better though. \u00a0Nonetheless, I still had to stomach the sour attitude given by the staff. Be prepared!",

    "text": "I went to Antoinette's outlet in Softel hotel for salted egg yolk lava croissant that is highly recommended by the public recently. The boutique serves the croissant from 1 pm. Considering its limited offer each day, my friends and I arrived at 12:30 pm. At that time, only one group with 2-3 persons was ahead of us...But the result was my friends and I only got the last croissant left. Why? 1) No queue number was offered. We were asked to sit at the Xperience Cafe to wait. When the sale began, several groups rushed to the counter. 2) They only served 25-50 croissants everyday in Softel outlet, which obviously cannot meet the demand in CBD. Under this context, it might be more reasonable to cap the quantity each customer can buy. However right now, one customer usually buy 5 croissants at one time. 3) When I called Antoinette's main store, the staff said they still had some stocks on Penhas Road. Alas, why they allocated such a little quantity to its outlet? After tasting the croissant, we should thank the boutique for saving us money. One is enough! The taste is just so so though the idea (mixing Asian ingredients with Viennoiseries) is brilliant.",

It's quite convenient to get to from Lavender MRT, about 5 to 10 mins walk, just cross the road from when you exit the MRT beside the ICA Building and then walk straight and turn left at penhas road. If you're driving, you can park at the HDB carpark just 1 minute away.The interior of Antoinette is one my favourite things about the place- very cosy and dainty victorian details reminiscent of marie-antoinette herself!The food is pricey but I guess you pay for the ambience! I had the poached eggs with toast, seved all day and not just at breakfast time. The eggs were nicely round and cooked well but maybe needs abit of salt before you tuck in. Had the hot chocolate, it wasn't the best thing in town but I still enjoyed it. Final verdict: If you feel like having a nice tea break with a good selection of light bites and desserts, make it a date here!",
