    "text": "My friend and I came to The Pelican for their Sunday Champagne Brunch. They offer three different pricing ranges (children, basic with no alcohol and a price inclusive of alcohol). We opted for the S$98++ which was only inclusive of free flow sodas and juices. Juices offered were: apple, grapefruit, pineapple, orange and cranberry. Their concept of buffet is not the walk around and fill your plate up and return to the table to eat. We had four full hours to sit and enjoy our made to order dishes. The staff started us off with the oyster and prawn platter (which is one order per person). We each get 2 fresh oysters and 4 shrimp. Later the grilled platter arrived (also one order allowed). The grilled platter came with 4 grilled oysters, 2 halves of a lobster, a grilled barramundi, and a grilled cuttlefish. Just receiving those two plates, the serving was decent. Later we also ordered the small plates (which you can order multiple times). We tried the beef sliders, lobster slider, corn, brocollini, truffle fries, clam chowder, NY striploin, and crab cake. The small platters are truly small platters. One slider, one crab cake and a small serving of steak nicely sliced in bite sizes. This is great so that we do not waste food, and each dish is prepared as you order, so they were all hot and juicy, which was greatly appreciated. There was a longer list of other options available to order, such as another soup, snapper pie (which looked amazing), seafood linguini and more. But we were so full with the above that we had to save the little room left for dessert. For dessert, they had three options: Ice cream, red velvet cake and a banana bread. The banana bread was delicious! The whole 3 hours we were there there were only another four of five groups there. Which was perfect, as it was not crowded or noisy. We could sit comfortably and chat and service was prompt to take our orders. And free-flow drinks is true - we had cranberry, pineapple, apple and a coke . I would say that for the quality and type of food and quantity we ate, we were able to get a good bang for our buck. Yes, it is overall on the pricier end, but, the ambience, location, and quality of the food was on par with the price. I would go back again with a bigger group, so then we can share and try more dishes. Just make sure your group has a good appetite!",

    "text": "Why is stuff so overpriced here?I knew I should've stuck to my guns and used the Entertainer app for a 1:1 deal. But noooooo, I had to listen to my stupid stomach and order the seafood platter instead. It certainly looked good, but you soon discover that the mussels were microscopic, and so were the clams, and the prawns weren't quite as large or fresh as you'd expect. Think: cooked prawns you buy from Woolworths. Lobster and crab were good, as were the oysters. (NB: $8 each for oysters?? It's almost cheaper to buy a plane ticket to NYC to eat the oysters there!)We decided that the platter wasn't enough for us, and being Asian, needed carbs. So we ordered the 'signature' linguine with clams. It came out well presented with plenty of clams. But totally lacked any flavour. Couldn't taste the wine, couldn't taste the clams, could certainly taste the overly generous garlic. Could've also done with an extra pinch or two of salt. Service was great (mostly) and friendly, and it's a very pretty place to eat and impress a girl on a date. $200 for 2 (no drinks) is a little steep for what came out though.",

The burger my friend order was medium-rare despite her asking for medium. The king crab lobster pasta was over garlicky and thus any flavour from the seafood was fairly masked.Gave an extra star cos the location let us caught a little fireworks.For the price I paid?

    "text": "Went here last night with some friends after watching the extreme boat races. There were seven of us and they had no problem seating us without a reservation. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the light show at Marina Bay Sans. The service was pretty good, but it seems they had some issues keeping orders straight and I waited about 20 minutes to get my still water after everyone in the group had already received their cocktails. We ordered the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and the burger with fries without the bun to split. My husband threw in an order for a side of fries after everything arrived because the portions weren't enough to feed two people who had completed the #FilthyFifty #Crossfit workout earlier that day. The steak was cooked perfectly and came on a small spread of mashed potatoes (approx 4 bites). I was happy with the burger, but found myself wanting veggies or something to round the meal out. The fries and the mashed just didn't do it for me. Overall, decent place with good drinks and food. Patio is nice. Service needs a little bit of work and the portions could be a bit larger with more variety. Happy we tried it, but there was nothing outstanding that will bring us back in unless we're in the area and looking for a place to get in quickly.",

    "text": "Dining at the Pelican brings me back to those movies in which the lead characters would dine at a waterfront seafood restaurant, enjoying a plate of fish and chips with some beer while watching the seagulls fly. There is no fish and chips here or any picturesque sea view, but there is a gorgeous view of Marina Bay and bountiful marine favourites to feast at Pelican Seafood Bar & Grill. Helmed by Austrian Chef Jonathan Sparber, the Pelican introduces an all-new \"RAW\" bar featuring delicacies such as Maine Lobsters and caviar. The concept of raw food was rather fuzzy to me initially. I thought I was going to have only raw food for the entire dinner. But as often said, the best way to digest an unfamiliar concept is to taste them.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A fraction of the menu is now devoted to the \"raw\" bar where diners can choose from lobsters, scallops, tuna to be done steamed, broiled and served cold, or torched. Hence, the seafood is not truly as raw as the usual Japanese sashimi, but more precisely prepared in a minimalistic way to showcase the sweetness of the meat. The scampi ($18 for 3pcs) which resembled a baby lobster, turned out ridiculously sweet when dipped in the fragrant seafood-infused butter sauce.The scallops ($18) were tender and juicy but the spotlight fell easily to the Trout Roe Brioche ($18). Half of the trout roe has been marinated with beetroot juices, thus explaining its dark red hues. Piled on top of buttered brioche, the roe brought a riot of \"popping\" effect on the tastebuds but they were a little too salty to go with the chewy bread. I am usually quite lazy when it comes to de-shelling crabs but I gladly make an exception for these brown crabs ($69) which were delicate and meaty. The selection of oysters here are impressive as well. Though we didn't get the XXL oysters that were harvested from Bouziges France, the Fanny Bay oysters from Canada ($8/pc) \u00a0were already as big as the palm of an average male adult. But size doesn't count when it comes to oysters as it seems like the majority of us preferred the smaller speciales oceanes from France ($9/pc) as they were milky, sweet but not too overwhelming. There's something of the entente cordiale to the main food menu as well. Starters range from soothing bowl Cream of Corn Soup with mussels and polenta ($18) to an artistic plate of Poached Lobster ($28). Fresh, sweet chunks of lobster meat are arranged on fennel, guarded by 2 kinds of polka dots made of avocado pur\u00e9e and Mary Rose cocktail-based mayonnaise. Old fashioned crab cakes ($24) is a kind of dish that is in vogue but none of those I've tried so far has ever come as good as these from the Pelican. They are so generous with the crab meat that I was startled when I took a bite of it. Perfectly seasoned and not greasy at all. Seafood are clearly the focus here, as all main courses except the steak and the burger are either fish or clams. This is not an issue as I am partial towards seafood. The Daily Catch of the Day was Halibut served on beetroot pur\u00e9e. While it is perfectly alright to skip the aesthetic aspect for home-cooked dishes, the presentation of this fish should not be less emphasized, especially when diners are forking out more than an average of $40 for a dish. Unfortunately, the bland taste did not make up for this dish as well. All is not lost as the Glacier 51 Toothfish ($45) was an impeccable dish. It was not only more visually attractive to the eye, but also appealing on its flavors and textures. The unique brioche crust gave the meat a crisp surface while the olives and corn sauce did not drown out the nuances of the meat. Rounding of the seafood feast are some refreshing yet unique home-made liquorice ice creams created by the experimental chef. The flavors changed randomly so you might even get beetroot on your visit. The tangy sour cream & white wine ice cream contrasted beautifully with the caramelized sweetness of the Banana Bread Pudding ($16), which managed to be not too rich. I would pick this over the Whoopie Pie ($16), which wasn't truly as heavy or overly sweet as it looked, but the sponge layers could be moister. Overall, I think seafood is still the forte of the Pelican and if you love fresh seafood, the Pelican will not go wrong. Nonetheless, a full dinner here does not come cheap so it is more suitable as the place for special occasions when you feel like pampering yourselves or your loved ones.",

    "text": "I think The Pelican is fairly new, having taken over the premises Pierside Kitchen & Bar, though I can't say for sure 'how new'.First things first, I love the decor. Red leather booths, quirky light fixtures, a bar that dominates an entire wall... it's definitely dressed to impress. The first time I walked past I had already made up my mind to try it, and so try it I did!I was quite conflicted on whether to give The Pelican 3 or 4 stars. I'd like to give this 3.5 stars, but alas. So caveat:IGNORE MY 3 STAR RATING, if you order the right dishes, it's a 4 STAR EXPERIENCE. Most of the dishes and items I've tried there have been mainly three star, maybe barely four star dishes, but I have to talk about the one five star dish I've tried from their menu. The Baked Snapper Pie. Ladies and gentlemen, this is as a good a fish pie as you'll find in Singapore. It's a huge swath of puff pastry that's golden brown and is so buttery you can smell butter before even breaking into the crush. It comes to the table piping how, dashing, and delicious.Breaking it open you'll find firm morsels of white fish (apparently they don't ALWAYS use snapper), cooked in a cream sauce with asparagus, mushrooms, and I think a bit of onion or fennel. The fish \"stew\" is amazing. The fish is fresh, firm, and the cream really carries the flavours of the asparagus and onions (I think there were onions) very well. It's so flavourful but so hot (temperature wise) that you end up in that conundrum of I WANT MORE IN MY MOUTH and OWW OW OW HOT HOT HOT. Trust me. Good food hurts.Other dishes I've tried include their Crab Louis, a light crabmeat salad with asparagus that was light, refreshing and tasty... though a little small in terms of portion size. The Pelican chowder is technically more a bisque, not being either cream or tomato based, it uses shellfish stock for the rusty brown colour. It's boldly flavoured and quite tasty though. The Black Peppered Candied Bacon caught my eye, and although it basically tastes like peppery bak kwah, it's an interested dish that has a great idea, but is poorly executed. (Bacon needs to be crisssspy)My most recent visit had me trying the Pelican platter, which is a lobster, a crab, 4 oysters, about 5-6 clams, 4 or 5 prawns, a little pot of swordfish ceviche and a marinated conch salad. The lobster was very fresh, and very easy to eat. The claws had been pulled and cracked, the head had been mixed with the coral, capers and parsley into a delicious lobster salad, the tail pre-cut so all you had to do was lever the meat out of the shell. The crab was bursting with roe, and very robustly flavoured... and the conch salad was marinated very well, and quite appetitizing. I don't take oysters but I'm told they were pretty good in terms of quality. Everything else on that plate? Meh. I'm just not a HUGE seafood person though, so maybe for real seafood fanatics, it might have been more enjoyable. Overall it seems clear that The Pelican is making a clear attempt on Luke's position as THE place for Boston-style seafood. While the snapper pie here is definitely a little better, and only one third the price of, Luke's lobster pie (which says A LOT), the advantage in price on everything else is also offset by slightly less panache in the way dishes are executed. It definitely gives Luke's a run for their money... but The Pelican (in my opinion), still doesn't quite match up.",
