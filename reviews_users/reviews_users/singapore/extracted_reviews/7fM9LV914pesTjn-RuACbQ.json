    "text": "Tonight I escaped the hustle and bustle of THE city and found myself in a Balinese paradise. Blue Bali really delivers. Transported away from my usual restaurant experience deep in the bowels of an \u00fcber modern mall, this gem is located directly on the lush Botanical Gardens. Blue Bali's design is such that the initial building, with lovely Asian art and full bar, shelters the true splendor to be found in the back of the restaurant. Just outside of this restaurant is a recreation of Balinese Resort villa life. Elaborate hand carved wooden buildings, babbling fountains with water features running below some of the private couples villas, and traditional cushion seating caught my eye at every turn. The staff, all dressed in rich fabrics reminiscent of yesteryear in Indonesia, all greeted me warmly with genuine, almost shy smiles. This visit was a bit spontaneous and I went to Blue Bali for some drinks. The signature drink, the Blue Bali, was delicious. It's a blend of blue cura\u00e7ao with hints of lemongrass and lime, on the rocks. Among other things, I saw caipirinhas on the bar list...I will definitely be back for Brazil's national drink!I took a tour of the micro brewery on site and was told it is more of a \"nano\" brewery. All custom beers... they seemed to be having as much fun with the beer as with the food. Beer with dragon fruit, beer with spices...there were at least 5 custom beers fermenting. (Loved the giant double crocodile wood carving mounted on the wall above the brewing machines in an otherwise stark room with shinning steel devices)Together with my drinks I had a wonderful fruit platter with red dragon fruit and an Indian styled appetizer with a spicy mint dip. I'm definitely coming back for more. Balinese charm, Pan-Asian cuisine done Bali resort style, Balinese music and smiling faces, a full bar and nano brewery, tropical plants, running water...can I move in?",

    "text": "We know Bali pretty well and loved the thought of experiencing some of the laid back vibes and open-plan architecture you so often find in the restaurants on the island itself.Upon arrival we stood what felt like ages in front of the \"reception desk\" with it being obvious that none other then the elderly gentleman behind the desk - we assume the owner - being entitled to welcome us and provide us with a table.He took his time to look up from \"paperwork\" and we did not like his presumptuous attitude one bit.The restaurant he lead us into is indeed laid out in the open-plan fashion that is common on Bali. It lacks however the great style and attention to detail the restaurants on Bali feature. I am particular and I notice small things quickly, but it all seemed a bit hastily put together, some tables with table cloths, some without, the table cloths being (while typical Bali patterns I recognised) different all over so that there was no harmony to the interior. Cushions and old chairs stacked in some corners and walk ways, some nice lamps scattered with no apparent thought on the atmosphere they could provide, and huge, ugly air-condition units around the whole place, with fans at the ceiling - the latter you would find on Bali, too.We were lead onto the \"outskirts\" of the restaurant, next to one of the air-condition-monsters, which made me impulsively move the table. The guy (owner, whatever) just reacted v-e-r-y slowly and then made his way back to his paperwork, presumably. Cheap plastic menus and plastic promotion cards (one bottle of wine with a menu etc..) made the whole concept seem like there just wasn't any. It took ages for someone to notice us and then ages until we got our food. The food was mediocre - especially compared to the price. The food selection itself was also not what we expected - we ended up with indian food (butter chicken? not Balinese....) as we did not like the meagre choices at prices that rival more upscale places in S'pore.I was disappointed. What an amazing location (S'pore botanic gardens all around you, al fresco dining, great & exclusive structure with an old building presiding), with the owner just not being up to the task of being a (good) host, and the service trying their best, but the food (and steep prices) not matching any of the expectations one has after all those glowing reviews and the (very) first impression.",

The platters were good size portions for trying a little bit of everything. Great tasting food!! \u00a0I am allergic to nuts and the manager made sure I knew of every dish that had nuts in it. That is NOT the kind of understanding service you always get in Singapore! Even for a Saturday night it was busy but not crowded. If your driving parking is limited in front of the restaurant. A little tricky to find but use google maps and you'll be fine.",
