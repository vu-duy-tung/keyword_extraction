They have a selection of finger food and small portions of ramen and rice. I had the karaage rice and the uma uma ramen. Both were pretty good. The drinks are little pricey. I had the zombie cocktail and it was pretty good. The bartender is nice and if you could name a drink, he could make it for you.",

The place is dimly lighted, so it is quite difficult to take a good picture here. Although there is not much customers, I am showed to a counter seat. The counter is packed with 2 loud groups, while the tables only has a quiet couple at one end. Bushi Tonkotsu Ramen ($19++)Bonito flakes, chasiu, white onions, bamboo shoots, egg, lime & red gingerI am told that the lime is used to kill off the strong fishy taste, although it does not make much of a different in the soup. The lime is given in a slice instead of a wedge, so it is quite difficult to squeeze out any juice. As the aircon is quite strong the dish turns cold very fast. The dish tastes quite average.Bespoke Cocktail ($25)It is a mixture of Diplomatico A\u00f1ejo rum, pineapple juice, passion fruit and almond. Tastes not bad, except that I have gone through a terrible experience with the staffs when ordering the drink. I have thought that I have ordered but it never comes. The billing of the drink is not what I expected.Overall poor service from the staffs. Food is average.",

    "text": "After so many missed opportunities, I finally made it out to Horse's Mouth! This is a fun bar to enter, at least if you do it through Uma Uma Ramen. Walk in, wave at the staff and say you're going downstairs, press the button that's slightly hidden on the side of the wall, watch as the black door just swooshes open, and descend to the basement where all the liquor is!In the past, walking in on a Friday night was impossible as they'd be fully booked, so I made sure to make a reservation this time. But surprisingly it was very quiet this time around. Was it because it was Deepavali earlier in the week and everyone went on holiday? Or could it be because Louis, the bartender everyone talks about, moved to L'Aiglon on Neil Road? Or are locals over the trend of speakeasies and subterranean bars?Whatever it was, I was just happy to finally get a seat. The decor is really neat and since there are no windows, it's just one of those watering holes that lets you lose yourself in your drink.The menu had a lot to offer, and they can also do bespoke cocktails as well. I ordered the Czech Connection, and although I can't list all the ingredients in it, just know it was stiff enough and was a nice way to start the weekend.Though you can get bar bites, I love how you can still order off Uma Uma's menu. (This also helps in saving some $$$ as The Horse's Mouth is more high end.) Hooray for getting affordable ramen and rice dishes along with cocktails!We arrived around 7, and even by 8:30 or so the bar wasn't filled up too much. Hopefully this isn't a bad sign, but hey, if you've been meaning to check this place out, perhaps now's the time!",

    "text": "Along with Jigger & Pony, Horse's Mouth is my other major pick for cocktails in Singapore. Bartender Louis is well-versed in the art of the stir & shake and provides pretty great conversation to boot. Pro-tip: ask him why he hates the Moscow Mule cocktail.The usual applies here: a menu exists but one need not be limited by it. Just tell Louis what you feel like drinking and he'll cook something up for you. I recommend their whiskey sour and also suggest you look at their bourbon & rye options. Willett Rye in particular is an excellent choice.You can also get ramen from Uma Uma, which is a pretty solid option for late night grub. The place is small so book ahead on weekends or walk in and sit at the bar on weeknights. My only complaint: early closing time of 12am.",

    "text": "Ok - I'm not that much of a drinker or going to bars every weekend. I do enjoy a drink or two every once in a while with good friends. I was looking for a place to go after teaching my dance class with my friends for my birthday drinks and found this place searching through Yelp. (Thanks Yelp!)We took a while to find the entrance for this place - we went through a dark door through Uma Uma Ramen even though the restaurant was closed the door was surprisingly still open and we found our way downstairs to Horse's Mouth. What a pleasant and beautiful surprise! The place is impeccably designed. Very Classy. My small group was seated immediately and we ordered amazing specialty cocktails. For once in my life, I was able to order a Cosmopolitan (I'm allergic to Cranberries) because they make it with Pomegranate juice. It was delicious! My second drink was also delicious and I told the bartender, Louis that I wanted something fruity, fizzy, and with rum in it. The drinks here are strong but also go down easy. Drinks in Singapore ain't cheap, and too many bars serve them watered down. This bar doesn't serve their drinks watered down and the concoctions are original. Very nice bartender as well. He kept coming over and talking to us. Great place to bring a group of friends for some drinks and conversation. :-) Definitely had a fun night. I will be coming back here.",

    "text": "Brand spanking new, and sleek as hell.A friend asked me to go check out this mysterious place with him - turns out to be under a new ramen joint, and ultra posh too.Apparently it was opening night, and despite rocking up fashionable late (we had to get grub at a wallet-friendly location first), it was standing room only for us.No matter though, this meant we got to chat with the bartender (Louis, who is awesome).He's what they call a mixologist - he'll make you something based on what you tell him: how you feel, what you had for lunch, and maybe even your horoscope... no promises on that last one though.A couple drinks later, my memory gets a little hazy, but I remember them drinks going down easy, and that to me is the mark of a solid cocktail. Japanese bar snacks aren't bad either; we had some of the tastiest saukura ebi I can remember.When I get a chance to go back, I'll make sure to ask all my burning questions: why is the bar called Horse's Mouth, and why is Louis so damn awesome!?Till then, let me recover from this crazy headache that I woke up with...",
