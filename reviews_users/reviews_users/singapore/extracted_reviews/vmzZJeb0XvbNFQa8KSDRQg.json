First of all, its just really uncomfortable--super hot everytime I have come. Yeah I know it's a rooftop bar and its Singapore, but you would think there would be a bit more of a breeze. They should get better and more fans. My main grip about this place though is the service. There is only one word for it--TERRIBLE. I have never been here and not had to wait an insane amount of time for my drinks. The bar is so disorganized and the staff is running around all the time and not getting anything done. Also, $18 for a beer? Really? Don't come here. Head to a rooftop bar in Club Street instead.",

Loof attracts a working crowd who is not afraid to get down to party. The bar is also becoming an increasingly popular spot for events - come for their weekly Thursday Loffapalooza. The bar spins a dance inducing mix of British bands, and there's just enough space for you to dance - a nice change from the often way too crowded indie nights at Poptart. Service at Loof is also excellent. The staff here are charming and friendly, without coming across as being 'try-too-hard'. All in, you're pretty much guaranteed a good night whenever you come to this bar.",

Their happy hour goes by the hour, so $5 SGD from 5-5:59, $6 SGD from 6-6:59, $7 SGD from 7-7:59, etc for well drinks. Pint-sized draft beers (Asahi black on draft, what!) are $10 in happy hour. THE DRINKSThe cocktails were the star of the show. Each was named after another famous Asian city or locaiton. My favorite was the Ginger Java - served with a grapefruit slice inside the middle. The Ho Chi Minh had wonderful mint and cucumber tastes, with gin. Lovely. THE FOODWe came here to try to infamous (even Ho Ching recommends them) Chili crab cheese fries. This is an interesting fusion idea, as is most of the food. I liked it, but I think I prefer traditional Chili cheese fries or Chili crab. The crab and Asian chili made it a little too sweet for my taste, but it was interesting. We also tried the roast duck and plum eggrolls, which were a bit overdone but not bad. Finally, we had the very nice happy hour sesame chicken wings. They were well fried and the glaze had a good flavor. THE SERVICE AND SETTINGAs mentioned, this is the perfect get together spot. Tables inside and out, with beautiful and lush greenery all over. The decor is modern and hip, and very inviting for you to linger and enjoy a Singaporean evening. The service is great and the waiters are friendly, helpful, and eager to serve. Would happily come back for any reason - happy hour, girls night out, date night, or a birthday party.",

Additionally, the happy hour is one of the better deals you can find in Singapore: glasses of house pours, wine and pints of Asahi for $5++, hard to find a better deal!But unfortunately this bar has also some minor downsides:- the red wine comes chilled (WHY?)- the food menu looks inventive and attractive but has never managed to fully convince. The Ramly burger is probably my fave, but as far as the other dishes I feel like the food is: \"nice try but try again...\"But overall this is one of my goto rooftop bar's and I have been back several times so when in doubt between 3 and 4 stars, I decided to give them 4 stars cause I think the concept is great, it is decently priced and just because I like it there! Also, when I think about this bar, I cannot help it but \u00a0sing in my head: \"the loof, the loof, the loof is on fire!!\"",

Light, refreshing and not straight sugar. I was a happy girl. Not on the happy hour menu, though. The food menu consisted of some creative bar food. Chicken lettuce pockets were great, as were the chicken wings. The French fries came in a huge portion. The salad with calamari was awesome and probably the healthiest thing we ordered. Trying to follow paleo diet? This place isn't for you!The atmosphere was hopping with music cranked and patrons enjoying what appeared to be a game of beer pong.

    "text": "We chance upon this place while researching for a decent restaurant to celebrate the birthday for a friend of mine. The setting of the bar looks really decent and heard some good reviews hence decided to visit this establishment. We spend a good 10mins trying to locate the place with the help of Google map. The signage to show the lift was not obvious and we had to circle the building just to find the sign. To ensure that I have a seat, I made a reservation via Chope (it is a pretty decent site), with an email reminder and a call from the bar, I felt that the before service was really well done. With high expectation, we were ushered to the long tables alongside of the bar-top and were given the menu. The menu was pretty detailed and with the help of online recommendation we order a couple of sides, mainly the Chili crab cheese fries, the happy hour chicken wings and a Kong ba bao (bun with pork). The food took some time to arrive and truth to be told, it was not really as fantastic as many mention. The fries were soggy, the wings were a tack too dry and salty, and the kong ba bao was not worth the money.However, my friends felt that the fries and wings were pretty decent thus the taste is up to your discretion. My friends order a couple of mixer to top it up since there is Happy Hour deals. But the drinks were quite disappointing and it tasted a little weird to us. At the very end, we did not finish the drinks. The service staff are friendly but the food took some time to arrive. The venue setting has really nice lighting and display however the music was just average. Hence if you are looking for a place to drink, I will not highly recommend this place. But it is still decent for the atmosphere with the open roof top concept.Improvement is needed on the speed of serving food and the quality of the drinks.",

These are just simply fantastic - like, mouthwateringly, finger-lickingly goooooood. Great wait staff. Service with a smile. My friend and I sat the bar, and suddenly the bartender sends us shooters he created. Just for fun. To let us try. For free. We compliment him on a refreshing shooter; he beams. And before we know it, he makes another round for us. On the house. Like, whaaaaaa?!?Ok. No no. All of that are great. But the reason why Loof deserves five stars is this -- their happy hour deals on house wines and house pours. 5-6pm = $56-7pm = $67-8pm = $7'nuff said. You're welcome.",

Ask for permission to let an injured person sit down? If not, do I have to stand for the whole night? Really makes you wonder. Honestly, I found the place a \u00a0bit too cramped for my liking and I was quite fascinated with how the waiting staff kept running about and not saying \"excuse me\" while nudging their way through the crowd.. I thought they will at least have basic courtesy to say \"excuse me.\" but i guess I was wrong.

    "text": "The newly renovated rooftop bar atop Odeon Towers has been hosting events since its inception, ranging from more high-profile ones such as the Giles Peterson events, and more recently, Tete-a-Tete which is an event where people get together and converse in foreign languages. The bosses of Loof were highly successful in marketing their concept, and have since opened The White Rabbit and Tanjong Beach Club. What sets Loof apart from your average bar is the choice of bar snacks. Tiger Toast ($9) with minced tiger prawns placed atop a lightly toasted piece of bread was very special. Their Loof Flies ($9), which essentially is French Fries with a variety of dips (wasabi, curry, chilli) was extremely addictive. It came in a bucket, and before the bucket was half full, we asked the waiter to get us another plate of sauces. Other interesting things on their menu are crayfish and babysquid, perhaps will try it another day.As for drinks, they have a standard range of wine and spirits. Try their Loof Life ($17), it is most refreshing with the zesty lime aftertaste. The Gummiberry ($17) is a drink I would recommend the girls, as the meringue (which the bartender slightly burns with his flame before serving) looks really pretty in pictures and tastes just as sweet as it looks too. Post-renovation, they updated their cocktail list to feature \"Asian Sensations\" - Ho Chi Mint, Penang Padi etc. Will definitely go back to try those ingeniously titled cocktails one day.",

    "text": "One of the more touristy places/bars. Drinks- Gummiberry (definitely a must try for ladies who love meringue). It's a fragrant concoction of forest berries, gin, Cointreau and French meringue. - The chocolate martini is an interesting concept but taste pretty average. - The other stuff is pretty standard. Food (typical bar finger food)- They use to have Monday Satays but now it's gone :( their satays were great! - Mini salmon pizza - pretty decent. Ambiance- It's a outdoor bar so it's pretty nice to when the weather isn't too hot or if it's not raining. Otherwise, probably should pass for the night. - The have limited number of indoor seats, comfy tanks with big fluffy pillows (as I recalled). \u00a0If you can score one, it's probably a good place to catch up with friends. - Occasionally, they have a DJ too.",

    "text": "I had been to Loof numerous times since they first opened back in the day, and I have to say that the recently renovated night spot is certainly new and improved. Not only have they updated the interiors, the concept has been revamped and I love the strong Southeast Asian slant that guides Loof's latest identity. The menu offers local favourites such as the chilli crab dip with fried mantou (watch out: this is spicy!) and the ramly burger with \"secret sauce\". Cocktails include Asian-inspired concoctions that take Bandung, Penang and Ho Chi Minh as their muses. There's even a booth by the lift that sells nostagia items from Singapore, and there will definitely be items that will stir some memories in you. However, despite this refreshing and original facelift, my experiences at Loof are still marred by their terrible service. When I was there last, reminding them that our drinks had not arrived was usually received with the apologetic response, \"Sorry, the bar is jammed.\" Given that they've been around for a while and know that it can get crowded on the weekends, I am surprised that they haven't been able to solve their issues. The worse, though, is that they are really sloppy with returning credit cards and change. If you've had a few drinks, make sure that everything is back in your wallet before you leave!",
