They started the place previously in Tanglin Road with whole family getting involved in preparing the signature dishes for guests. Cat is the current owner of The Curry Wok and is running this place with her hubby.They have been recognized as \"'Bukit Timah's Best Culinary\" by 8 days. Their Business name sounds spicy and often people mislead that they are only selling spicy dishes but in fact The Curry Wok do have non spicy dishes too.Thanks to the owners who diligently visited the market. These prawns were fresh, deliciously whipped up from the kitchen with chilli, lady's fingers and and onions.Chilli Prawn - $13Sambal Sotong cooking style is pretty similar to Chili prawn's ingredients just that the difference of the chilli as well as the seafood used. Succulent Sotong rings was smartly paired with the addictive Sambal.Sambal Sotong - $13A reminisce of home made goodness! Crispy deep fried Ngo Hiang presented in large strips of a combination of minced pork and prawn, accompanied by some Achar. Dab a piece of it into the given sweet sauce and enjoy a its juiciness. Recommended!Home-made Ngo Hiang - $11The color and presentation of Beef Rendang was liven up by the used of corinander and banana leaf against the orange brown gravy meat. Great that the they came in bite size portions and tender. Apart from that, Rendang gravy used was sufficient, adequately covering each piece of beef.Beef Rendang - $13One of the Nonya Classics, Chap Chye, I cannot do without everytime when I am in a Peranakan Restaurant. It was well executed with ingredients such as cabbage, bean curd skin, black fungus, mushroom, carrot and cellophane aka \"Tang Hoon\". Taste was inviting and was not too oily and salty. Even having without pairing is white rice is alright for us.Nonya Chap Chye - $10Brinjal & Ladies Finger teamed up well over here. You get the spongy texture from Brinjal as well as the crunchiness from the Ladies fingers with some fiery kick from the Sambal Chilli.Sambal Brinjal & Ladies fingers - $10If you love Century Egg and Tofu, you might want to order this simple side dish. The wobbly Tofu comes in a whole block, topped with slices of Century Egg and generously covered by fried shallots and corriander.

    "text": "At the first sight, it looked like a small eatery located in the middle of a row of shophouses, off the main road. But you would surprised at the long history behind this place. Many years ago the family started an eatery called Chye Seng Huat which was located in Tanglin road. Various relatives helped in the place which built up the menu with dishes such as Hainanese Pork Chop (made with cream crackers), and otah (which originated from an relative who was from Muar, Malasyia). The eatery was later closed when government took over the land for redevelopment.About 15 years ago the current owner's mother fell in love with the current location, when she drove past the place and decided to setup a restaurant with the family's recipes. Most of the ingredients were bought fresh daily. Sambal Brinjal & Lady's Fingers (S$10)While spicy, there was no slimy around the lady's fingers (a sight of very cooked) which was no easy to get it right. Like the firm texture of the vegetable.Beef Rendang (S$13)Made of beef shank, the meat was very tender and flavourful. Could feel it melt in the mouth without much chewing.Home-made Ngo Hiang (S$11)Unlike the usual version (Hokkien version?) which had water chestnut in them, the version here was replaced with leek (Teochew version). It was different kind of sweetness in the dish.Chilli Prawns \u00a0(S$13)The flavour was similar to the sotong version, but packed with crunchy prawns.Century Egg Tofu (S$10)While simple in look, the strong flavoured egg was balanced by the sauce and bland beancurd.Nyonya Chap Chye (S$10)The version was slightly different from the usual braised until very soft version. Here the vegetables remained with a slight bite and crunch.Sambal Sotong (S$13)Well cooked with the squid still tender, while the sauce was spicy with a sweet aftertaste.The meal was accompanied with Grass Jelly with Milk (S$2.50) which was grass jelly strips topped with evaporated milk. Quite refreshing.Overall the dishes had a home cooked feel. No wonder the busy residents staying around have been packing the food for takeaway.",

    "text": "Another one of my high school lunch hunts, Curry Wok is best enjoyed with a party of four. Think zi char, with a nonya twist :) You can get most of your traditional zi char dishes here, but also many peranakan cuisines too. Actually, I can no longer tell the cuisines apart since so much of the nonya style has influenced our zi char dishes anyway.Fish head curry and chicken curry here are both awesome, super \"lemak\". Sambal vegetables is definitely a must order at any restaurant. Also try their rendang and pork chop :) The restaurant is super small so definitely come during off peak hours and be prepared to sit outside!",

    "text": "It is not closed! Dinner crowd on Saturday was more than this tiny place could handle. Signature dishes are the Chinese curry fish head: the fish and veg for this dish were very fresh. However it lacked the kick that you get from the Indian variety. The prawn rolls were very substantial and well fried. The chap chye was a little lackluster, perhaps having been heated and reheated in the pot all day. The pork knuckle was tasty but not cooked sufficiently for the meat to fall off the bone. Service was good and prompt. It mostly caters to people from the neighborhood who can well afford the somewhat higher prices that you have to pay for this kind of food. I will return if I was in the neighborhood but this is not a foodie haunt.",

    "text": "Curry wok always reminds me of my jc days, and part of why I still go back up till this day is because of how it always makes me feel nostalgic in a good way. Do not be deceived by its nondescript location and shop front, this place is a real hit with students can get really crowded during lunch hours even during weekdays. They serve traditional homecooked dishes, and this place is really more like an upmarket tze char where you can order dishes to share. My favorite has to be the cold century egg tofu- I could eat the entire portion in one sitting! I've never really figured out the origin of this dish, but it doesn't change the fact that it's extremely delicious. I sometimes order the curry when I'm especially hungry- I would have liked it to be a little spicier, but the meat was cooked just right. The entire dish is not too gelat but still tastes sufficiently complex. I would urge you to give this restaurant a try if you are looking for decent, homely dishes at a reasonable price.",

    "text": "This is the great thing about Singapore. There is always cheap and good food around every bend and the Curry Wok is one such example. Totally affordable with generous portions, this is one place you should not miss. Yes, I did it again and ordered beef rendang. As a frequent beef rendang consumer, I feel I am qualified to give you the run down. This beef rendang is tender and the sauce is dry and packed with loads of flavour, just the way I like it (Generally a more Indonesian/ peranakan way of cooking beef rendang whereas the Malay version tends to be wet with gravy). The otak is a must try as well! Best to share as it comes in a pretty big block, just take a look at the picture if you don't believe me. You don't have to be on a budget to eat here, the food is so good, you could just eat here to satisfy your cravings!",

    "text": "This place is great for a sit-down group meal, especially if you're a student, where you can get four dishes at $7 each (minimum four people). Still, Curry Wok does a really decent spread of chinese and nonya dishes, especially their cold Century Egg Tofu (just nice for 2-3 people), Hainanese Pork Chop (very homely feel to this dish) and Sayur Lodeh. Needless to say they do a good curry too. I've only ever tried their Curry Chicken, which is tender and the curry not overly spicy. Their Curry Fish Head does look pretty mean, though.My main qualm about this place is how small the portions get sometimes, so I always find that we order many dishes in order to get a substantial meal.",
