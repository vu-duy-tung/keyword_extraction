    "text": "Woke up this morning, saw on Instagram that a friend was here having yummilicious salted egg croissants and BAM, 3 hours later I'm chilling in a white muji-like chair enjoying my tray of treats at Asanoya.Verdict:- Matcha Salted Egg Croissant: This is simply divine. I'm not a fan of salted egg confectionery so I was kind of hoping that the matcha taste would overpower the salted egg and I was right! If you've ever eaten \"boulou bun\", the chinese version of salted egg buns, the Matcha Salted Egg filling is similar in texture to that while the croissant was light and fluffy - just the way I like it! I ordered this as a takeaway but after a while, I decided to have it right there and then. I was too lazy to ask the staff to heat it up for me but I bet that it will taste even better if it's warmed up. Will remember to do that next time.- Bacon Pizza (Popular choice): I picked this because it was deemed as the popular choice and I wanted some meat. However, in my opinion, nothing really special about this except for the 4 tiny cheese cubes on the Bacon Pizza. The cheese cubes could be bigger though but otherwise, I would choose other pastries to try next time.- Chicken Miso salad: It looked better in pictures then it actually is. Priced at $3, it's a good stomach filler if you're not so hungry and yet want something savoury besides bread to go with your coffee or juice.- Cold pressed carrot juice: $5.80 for freshly cold-pressed juice? A tad pricey in my book but I was in the mood to indulge. They only have 4 types of fruits to choose from - apples, orange, carrot and watermelon.I am really not a bread person but today, I had bread for lunch (enough to last me a month) and I feel quite satisfied. Says a lot about Asanoya right? Spotted lots of Japanese ladies and men having lunches and tea breaks there and it sure added to the whole jap muji-like feel of the place and that is why this place has 5 stars from me (plus the clean washrooms and plugs too)! All of their breads are gorgeous in presentation and it was difficult to decide which to try. Will be sure to return within the next few days as it is right next to SMU!Also, Asanoya is currently giving away 10% voucher for your next purchase with a minimum spend of $10.Tip: The places gets a little bit crowded during the lunch hour but it is still bearable. Best to avoid lunch times between 1-2pm. The seating area is peppered with lots of power points so it's a good place to chill and surf net/charge phone/play games or write reviews! Plus, the toilets are really clean and nice so plus points there.",

    "text": "It's been a couple of months since Japanese bakery chain Asanoya Boulangerie opened its first-ever outlet outside of Japan in Singapore but i wasn't too quick to join the queue at the Queen Street outlet. Well i guess that's a good thing since when i recently visited, i found the place quiet and peaceful (also empty) during brunch time on a Saturday. Well i guess the hype kind of died down when people realised that Asanoya is first and foremost a bakery, not a cafe. Hence, unless your idea of brunch is a small sandwich, pastry or cake, you may be disappointed when you visit. Thankfully, Asanoya's offerings are perfect for this petite bread lover! Also, do not come expecting artisan coffee. My flat white was nothing like a flat white and it was burnt, but i was wise not to have any expectations.Before i could get started on my order, i was distracted by the freshly baked loaves on display. Of course i had to sample them before i can decide on what to buy home!The signature Karuizawa bread comes in various flavors and i tried the blueberry and green tea ones. The bread has the typical European crust (though not too hard) and the interior of the typical soft chewy and airy Japanese bread. Each loaf is pretty big, weighing more than 1.2kg but they price it by slice/weight as well, so you can easily grab a few pieces in your preferred flavors. The breads are lightly sweetened and perfect on their own.Asanoya also has the smaller earl grey tea loaves ($4.20) which everyone should get their hands on (i would walk away with all in fact). First flush earl grey tea leaves are used and flavors such as orange and blueberry are also available. I would have gotten the original but the blueberry was a nice match with the tea (orange was a little overpowering).On to the savories, the Bacon quiche ($6) had an asian flavor to it (onions) and tasted a little like those zi char fu yong omelette. The egg custard was still satisfying, that it until you hit the extremely salty cheese bits. The crust needs more work as you can see from the thick, undercooked and hard edges.Other hot savory favorites include the Potato French bread which encased an entire potato in it, with butter and mayonnaise. Comes highly recommended by fellow food bloggers. Carb in carbs anyone? The Campagne cranberry and cheese bread would be my choice for brunch if i could stomach more food. Just look at those chunks of cheese! Other than that, i also would not give the maple walnut pretzel a miss. \u00a0As for the sweet stuff, Asanoya is known for their lava Cube Loaf ($4.50) which comes in chocolate and green tea. Do not expect it to ooze like a lava cake. I was under the impression that the wait staff would warm it up for me (he said he would) but the center was still cold. Well, the custard was sufficiently milky, with a light sweetness. I did enjoy the slighty chewy bread and i could it on its own. Overall, Asanoya Boulangerie is a nice spot to enjoy some tea bread with tea (skip the coffee please). I would consider popping back to stock up my breads if i'm in the area. You can also get spreads, dips and oils which will complement the breads from the on site gourmet shop. Set lunches are available too.",

    "text": "Something that bewildered me is the sheer popularity of the Cube Loaf--cream filled cube-shaped bread available in Yuzu cheese, Caramel apple, Matcha, Chocolate, etc. Perhaps due to our nation's fetish for something goeey or flowy in the centre (think Liu sha bao or molten lava cake), this has been the most featured item on any media platform. However, I suggest we try to manage our expectations as the Matcha is just a chewy chocolate bread filled with sweet matcha custard that is resistant to flow. Perhaps the chef did not intend to make it flow in the first place. The problem wasn't whether it flowed or not, but that the cream was too sugary, to the extent that it overpowered the demure tea taste. At a hefty tag of $4.50, I'm hesitant to invest in another one. The Cinnamon Danish ($3.20) called out to me with that attractive dark brown sheen but it was more chewy than crunchy, as the sticky caramel goo clung on stubbornly to the knife .....and my cavities the more I chow on it. Though the Sweet Potato Yuzu Cream Danish is constructed on the similar danish base, the main ingredients helped to distract us away from the mediocrity. Yuzu is not only visibly detected as peels on top but also in the white cream base, which imparted a lovely tanginess that complemented the warm sweet potatoes. I was glad we stood by this \"less-popular\" option instead of the all-too-common blueberry custard danish. The other autumn-inspired bread named \"Harvest\" ($4.50) was also excellent. The texture of the bread is chewier than an average European baguette but the subtle honey flavour crawled out as one slowly bite into it. The earthy sweetness from the candied sweet potatoes, chestnuts rode upon the savoury cream cheese to create another wonderful dimension in this humble stick that is easily overlooked on the shelf. I love the Signature Curry Bun, which tasted like any orthodox non-spicy Japanese curry bun with the mellow sweetness. We were lucky to get one from the batch that was hot out from the deep fryer so it was crunchy and not too oily. The Mushroom Quiche ($6) is indeed a very straightforward quiche with plenty of mushrooms. While there could be more salt in this, there was enough that it registered for me. This was good but the Potato French was even better. At $3.20, one get an entire potato with skin intact, snugged tightly within the crusty French bread under the luscious blanket of butter and mayonnaise. Have it warmed up and one would be greeted by mini billows of steam from the soft potato. Genius.Despite the liberal amount of icing, I was not assaulted by a blast of sweetness in the Caramel Apple Croissant ($3.90). The tartness of the soft-but-not-mushy apples cut through the dense almond paste. Also, the flaky pastry here managed to salvage my impression of their weak Danish dough. The signature Karuizawa Green Tea Loaf is sold here in grams at $2.60/100g, which is about the weight of one slice. Blended with white chocolate, the bread has a tinge of milky sweetness, which was slightly different from the taste when I had it in Japan. Nonetheless, the texture is still spot-on; soft stretchy with a crusty brown shield. Would be great if they can also introduce the Coffee loaf in future.Overall, the savory items were more remarkable than the sweet items, even though the price across all items was not very pocket-friendly. I was quite disappointed by the sweet bread but maybe to think on a positive note, the cube loafs are something exclusive to Singapore market. Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement before both the quality of the food and the service standards here can match up truly with the level in Japan.",

The building is set back from the street a little bit so don't miss it. Inside, the whole place is pristine clean with fantastic lighting and a fresh, new, modern look. The displays of shopping goods like their teas etc. are very nice and inviting. The main thing though is the pastry and bread counter. Everything looks so delicious and fresh that you just want to try each one. I felt like I was in a real French Boulangerie. I had a blueberry Danish with my coffee that was so good that I had to go back and get a second one before my coffee was finished. I saw that they had lunch items as well so on another day I had lunch there. I don't remember exactly what I had now but I had the potato salad with it and it was fantastic. The double cappuccino was perfectly made. The staff was enthusiastic, cheerful and polite. I will see you again on December 27th or 28th!",
