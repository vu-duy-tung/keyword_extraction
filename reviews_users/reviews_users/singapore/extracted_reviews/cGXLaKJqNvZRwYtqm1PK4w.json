    "text": "Came to check out this place for lunch. I ordered Fresh Toast, which came with a canned drink for a total of S$10. Apparently they are having this lunch deal promo (Mon-Fri from 12-3 pm) for S$10, S$12, S$14 price - depending on what you order. Do take a look at one of the pictures I posted along with this review - to see a complete list.Going back to the French Toast I ordered, I really love it. The french toast is focaccia french toast - it came with slices of apples and peaches, and was drizzled with honey and rolled oats.The sweetness was just nice. The texture was great. The portion was quite big. If you plan to come here with one other person, it might be a great idea to order another dish - maybe the savory one. My friend ordered a burger that comes with curly fries. Man, I love the fries here. I think they put some herbs, which makes the fries smelled fragrant, and the crunchiness and thickness were just right. I think I might come again to this place just for the fries.They do have some interesting drinks, i.e. bandung latte and dirty bandung latte. Babycinno is basically just a cappuccino, but in a smaller serving.The reason of why I don't give 5 stars is because food may take quite sometime to be served. So it's a good idea to come here before you are really starving.I do recommend coming to this place for lunch. I love the vibrant atmosphere of the area, as well as for the lunch set deal itself. Definitely worth every penny =)",

    "text": "\"Come here for free perfume - Eau de Deep Fryer\"Another Friday, another team lunch.So today, the team decided to check out Working Title - a caf\u00e9 located at the tail end of Arab Street towards Beach Road in the Malay enclave of Kampung Glam. The caf\u00e9 looks pretty neat and old school, with the use of floppy disk to tell you the wifi password (YES! Free wifi, such rarity in Singapore), used beer bottles as vase on each table and a very charming courtyard behind the main dining area. The courtyard looks like a nice meeting place for small groups but with the almost translucent roof, meaning a lot of natural light to the extent of almost too bright, the 5 of us decided to sit in the main dining area instead. Now the main problem at the dining area or should I say the setup of this caf\u00e9 is the built in kitchen right in the main dining hall itself. If you want to have a open concept kitchen, you better make damn sure that the suction is working damn good and the ventilation is world class standard. But unfortunately for this caf\u00e9, the suction they used is nothing but cheap ones and ventilation? If you call air-con blasting to ventilate the entire place together with the smell of oil all over, then yes, it's ventilation. \u00a0But I don't think the right term for ventilation is what I just described.Food wise, it was alright. \u00a0There are 3 versions of set lunch available with fancy names and price ranging from $9.90 to $14.90. You get a main and juice / iced tea. If you want to change to coffee, you will have to top up some amount of money. We ordered a couple of items from the menu - smoked salmon focaccia, beef burger and the big breakfast (not in set lunch) and we didn't enjoyed as much as we were rushing to quickly finish our food and get out from there. \u00a0I will never ever come back to this place again for lunch unless they move the kitchen elsewhere. We're a bunch of office workers, dressed up in formal wear and imagine, all our hair and body smell like used oil from the deep fryer after lunch at this place. Tragic. P/s: the staffs are clueless about the 10% yelp discount and was told you cant use that for set lunch which i thk it's rather stupid and irrelevent.",

    "text": "My girlfriends decided to have our monthly Sunday brunch here after reading positive reviews about this place. But it turns out nothing as what we expected. Here goes. Unlike other brunch places on Sunday, this place is empty when we reach. Looks dingy. Ordering of food is self service. Same goes for water and condiments. They use Heinz packet chilli sauce. Very western-stall-in-local-coffeeshop feel.Starting off with satay sauce fries, served lukewarm, I would say it's just blah. You can even replicate it yourself. Just go McDonald's to get their fries then any satay stall for the peanut sauce and ta-dah, satay sauce fries. It is cheaper this way too.Don't know how long has passed, their Working Big Breakfast that I ordered came. The plate is pretty packed which is a sight I love. It has 3 slices of ham, a chicken sausage, salad, 2 slices of bread, a sunny side up and 2 pieces of turkey bacon etc. However, the only thing that is hot is my chicken sausage. The rest on the plate is at room temperature. Bread was untoasted. Dried mixed herb was sprinkled on the ham slices which puzzles me. It doesn't improve the presentation or even taste good. As for the salad, there is no dressing.My friend had their Gula Chicken Sausage. She was also disappointed with her food as the only hot food is the Gula Melaka caramelized onions which we find not bad. My another friend who is a vegetarian ordered the portobello egg and cheese. They have replaced the bacon for some tofu cubes. Not sure what to feel about this combination as it is pretty new to us too. Tl;dr: won't be coming back here again. Simple breakfast ingredients dumped on a plate. Tad overpriced imo.",

    "text": "Work's been kinda crazy, so I've been on a Deliveroo binge. I'd heard a lot about the burgers from Working Title and decided to give the Baconator and the Honey Lemon Wings a try. The food arrived within half an hour. Despite being wrapped up in aluminium foil (not the best way to pack a delivery burger, IMHO), the burger was moist, still a little pink and pretty tasty. The patty was a little on the small side (which burger place in Sg isnt tho?) and because of the way it is shaped, hard to eat. Some bites were all bread, some were all meat. The turkey bacon and the caramelized onions were a nice touch, although I wish there was more mesclun and fries. Portions are small. If you're hungry, I'd recommend the Tower of Power (although two of those patties would be harder to eat!!) The wings were juicy but a tad on the sweet side (I'm more of a savoury person). Not bad considering it was delivered. Probably be much better eaten there",

End up, some of my friends have the discount and some don't, depending on who you were being served by. Apparently I heard that if the boss is around, standards will be very good. So we were unlucky...Maybe the coffee is better but we were there for lunch so didn't get coffee. The pizza was served over some baking paper like thingy. It stuck to the paper and my friends have to pry them out to eat. Can tell the pizza is not freshly made but was pre made and re-toasted in the oven, \u00a0it stuck to the paper. And the toppings look pretty meager and sad...Overall I don't recommend this place and I will not come back again.",

    "text": "I'm almost hesitant to write a review about this place because of how much I like it, for the fear of it being flooded by the fake hipsters from (the dangerously close) Haji Lane.My principle for patronising a cafe is very simple. I try not to go to ones that has appeared on a list of any sort, you know the ones I'm talking about- \"10 great cafes for coffee hopping\" on some random \"cool\" blog shared by 3482393 people on Facebook, chances are it's going to be overflowing with a crowd, the sort that takes 3482 top-down, generic-looking photos of their \"latte\" which they can't tell from their 3-in-1 instant coffee.Working Title on a weekday afternoon doesn't seem to suffer from these symptoms of cafe cancer that seems to be spreading to all establishments that appear on the likes of Timeout and 8 days.Prices were really moderate, a refreshing break from the other sorts whose goal is seemingly just to capitalise on the coffee/cafe trend before it flops and dies like bubble tea. No GST or service either. Ammmazing.Combined with the 10% off upon first checkin on Yelp, it's a pretty good deal.$7 for a pretty decent slice of cake$6 for a rather huge pot of tea (interesting flavours brewed from real leaves)We didn't order much from the menu as we were just looking for a hopefully quiet location to sit down and spend the rest of the afternoon. Hopefully we'd be back for more in the future.Free, good, fast WiFi.Plenty of seats, a good outdoor area at the back which is enclosed with air-conditioning but with plenty of sunlight still. Suspicious noises came occasionally but nothing too disturbing to spoil the ambience entirely.There's music, not the loud top 40s shit that blares in your eardrums stopping you from having any kind of conversation.The decor is interesting. It is a haphazard combination of cheap swedish crap (read: IKEA) and other random odds and ends (wooden crates? Maybe stolen from The Bravery. At least here they put cushion on top!) but it works together very well. Doesn't come off as trying too hard.",
