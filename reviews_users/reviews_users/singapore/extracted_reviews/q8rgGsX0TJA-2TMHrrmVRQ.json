There's a Starbucks nearby, but somehow the ambience at Craftsmen is just way better. Plus the option of a $5 half pint of Asahi is also quite the boost!",

The chocolate cake itself was a bit dry but the mousse was good. The cherries didn't have much flavour.Soy chai latte - 4.5 starsThis was excellent!

    "text": "Visited for a tea break this time and the desserts did disappoint. The flat white was average but lacked the kick it used to have. What was disappointing was the nitrogen coffee, which did not provide the smooth texture expected from the typical nitrogen infused brew but was instead filled with nitrogen foam on top. Overall, it was largely acidic and rough, lacking distinct notes. The cakes were coated with a thick oily layer of butter cream that was somewhat hard-the same cream for both the lemon meringue and the Smores cake. This failed expectations especially since the two cakes were of diversely different flavours. I would've expected the frosting to be infused with the different flavours and textures-the Smores one to be sticky and fluffy, and the lemon meringue to be soft and smooth, but both failed to meet expectations. Overall, a disappointing experience given the quality brunch on the previous visit. Will not be visiting again anytime soon",

The ambience is pretty chill here and almost \"student-free\". Sorry Starbucks, but I think I found a more appealing space to enjoy my coffee, tunes, and wifi.",

    "text": "Much different service by the staff here. We were greeted with an aloof cashier who didn't and couldn't be bothered to say anything beyond necessary, and her smile is golden for i didn't see it once. Ordered sunny lovin because I had a great one at Siglap v outlet, and a croissant sandwich with German bratwurst for the Husband. Plus two lattes. One large and one regular. Except said cashier got it wrong and made both large.The food came fairly quickly. But the sunny lovin was distinctly different in standards. Firstly it was full of poaching water, which made the muffins slightly soggy. Plus the guacamole was much less generous. It didn't spread through the entire muffin and it wasn't as thick as Siglap V's version. Also ordered a slice of cake. Matcha green tea with salted egg yolk. Was not bad. Couldn't taste the egg distinctly but it lent a richness and rounded the flavour of the matcha. Fortunately the coffee was just as good. Won't be back here for food.",

    "text": "Another day, another hipster cafe pops up on the island. Craftsmen (of Siglap fame) have finally expanded to another location. After a while, every cafe looks almost cookie cutter in appearance. Distressed wood and unfinished metal, concrete floors and bare lightbulbs.Apart from the lattes, cappuccinos and cold brews on the menu, some brunch items are on offer such as waffles, croissants, poached eggs, and churros. They are pretty standard and generally consistent. Maybe I've become a little jaded given the similar options at every single cafe. I normally go for the coffee.But I shouldn't complain too much, it's a welcome place to park yourself with a laptop instead of shuffling off to the 24 hour Starbucks across the street.",

    "text": "Went to Craftsmen Specialty Coffee at their new Novena location for brunch on a Sunday. We ordered 2 egg dishes (Sunny Lovin' and Craftsmen Breakfast) and 2 coffees (coconut latte and iced salted caramel latte). I asked about the difference between a regular and large sized coffee so I would know if they just pour in more milk for a large or if they add an extra shot of espresso. The answer I got from the barista was confusing as he said it had 4 shots of espresso. Coffees both came out after about 10 minutes and they both tasted great!The Sunny Lovin' arrived after about 20 minutes. The Craftsmen Breakfast took 30 minutes. By the time the second plate of food arrived, the first meal was already finished being eaten.Half an hour is too long to wait when all that needs to be cooked is bacon and eggs. Warm up some baked beans and toast, throw on some rocket and dressing and 2 pieces of smoked salmon and that was the rest of the dish. \u00a0Combined with the $20 price tag and meals coming out at staggered times; the great coffees just don't make up for the poor service and long wait times. The washroom lights are activated by a sensor, however it did not work consistently. As I was in there the light kept turning off and not turning on. Try as I might waving and flailing my arms, I sat there in darkness and went about my business. Even after standing to wash my hands, the lights did not turn on. After speaking to one of the staff they checked into it and the sensor is working. So maybe just bad luck for me. If you're looking for a good cup of coffee to go then you're in the right place. If you're expecting value for their food and quick service then I would not bother going here. Pros:-great specialty coffees-free water(?)Cons:-long wait time for food-orders do not arrive at the same time-slow service-expensive for what you get (imho)-washroom light sensor inconsistent Overall: 3/5This was there first weekend open so I'm sure they had difficulties. They had already run out of some of the items on the menu when we arrived at noon. Really hard to think of pros other than the coffee but will return to try brunch again in a few weeks and expecting a far better experience.",
