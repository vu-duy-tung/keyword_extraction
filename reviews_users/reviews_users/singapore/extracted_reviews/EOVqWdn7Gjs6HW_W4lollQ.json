    "text": "Not sure how this place has such a high rating. I went for the breakfast buffet which was pretty disappointing. For around $40 per person, you'd think the quality would be much better but I guess you're paying for the view and ambiance, not the food. The dim sum was awful and tasted like microwaved frozen food (my dim sum on Singapore Airlines was better). None of the fruit juices were freshly squeezed but rather came out of a store bought carton. There's juice stands everywhere in Singapore selling fresh juice for $1-2 and this high end restaurant can't even bother to make their own?? Tried 3 different pastries and all were extremely dry and flavorless. There was a limited selection of cut up fruits and they happened to be room temperature. Aren't we in Southeast Asia where the tropical fruits are abundant? Instead, they served honeydew and cantaloupe that weren't even sweet. The best items were the porridge (and toppings bar) and museli. Great, so we spent over $120 for a 3 person meal that I could've made at home for $10. Visit at your own risk but don't say I didn't warn you!",

I can only assume, because she did not ask anyone else in line the same question, it's because I'm an African-American woman. We TOO have money to spend.

Their seafood is imported from the farmers markets of Santa Monica so that was kind of funny. The food was beyond incredible. The Kaya toast was the die for but my boyfriend loved loved loved the veal tartare. I also loved loved loved the oyster gratin. The small appetizer bites were packed with flavor and freshness. It was one amazing bite after another. For entrees, my friend got the veal chop which was amazing and you should totally get that. The crispy skin sea bass was also delicious. For dessert, I was in love with, and still dream about, the chocolate semifredo. Omg. Do it, get it! Everything I ate was mind blowing. We basically ate every appetizer and every dessert. Everything was amazing and you basically can't go wrong with anything you order here. Yum yum! I would go back if I was in Singapore again. The view was amazing from the top floor, we even got to see fireworks because Formula 1 was in town and wrapping up!",

It's his second restaurant in Singapore after CUT which is another grandiose masterpiece. His first Spago restaurant in Beverly Hills was awarded with 2 Michelin Stars. The menu here is said to be mainly focused on 'Californian cuisine' that includes seasonal dishes prepared and cooked in an avant-garde manner. However, I personally think that most of the food here is quite creative, extremely delicious and impeccably influenced by Asian cuisine for example;Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi ($34)Honey Miso Broiled Japanese Black Cod ($49)Steamed Salmon \"Hongkong Style\" ($42)Kaya Toast with Seared Foie Gras and Pandan-Coconut Jam \u00a0($33)If you fancy a more casual atmosphere, there is a terrace lounge side offering another delicious Asian influenced bites like Pork Pot Sticker Dumplings ($15), Grilled Korean Pork Belly ($19) and Chinese Bao & Glazed Short Ribs ($16).Overall, I'm impressed and it totally exceeded my expectation!! I'll be back.Note: The lounge overlooks MBS' famous infinity pool with a spectacular view of the city skyline which is totally a PLUS! I love this romantic place indeed.",

    "text": "Love it here. Spago opened up very recently atop Marina Bay Sands, overlooking the badass infinity pool. This is Wolfgang Puck's marquee restaurant brand and I am beyond excited they opened it at this location in Singapore. I've been to the ones in LA (My mother's favorite), Las Vegas and Hawaii in the past and always very much enjoyed their great service and impeccable food. In addition to those three, they also have restaurants in Colorado and Istanbul which all have unique ingredients that make each Spago restaurant very different from each other. Spago Singapore is also innovative in its own way and you will see this immediately when receiving the menu to find \"Kaya Toast\", Pan Seared Alaska Halibut \"Laksa\", and Steamed Salmon \"Hong Kong Style\" on their menu.I've been to this restaurant once and their lounge on numerous occasions for date nights and friends gatherings and this place really can't be beat for a late night open-air lounge feel. After a few drinks, I had a momentary setback to thinking I was in LA or Miami.But let's start with restaurant side:You walk into a door that reminded me of The French Laundry in Napa and feel completely away from the MBS setting. Total class all around from the moment you sit down and are offered water. The food and service are outstanding. Spago calls itself a Californian cuisine restaurant (which I've always felt means the kind of food you would eat while kicking back and drinking wine) and we actually had a waiter from California serve our table which was pretty cool.My girlfriend and I ordered the following:1) Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones - This is Spago's staple starter across all of his restaurants. Every part of it is fresh, even the cones are handmade in the Spago kitchen. SO GOOD!2) Hand Cut Agnolotti with White Truffle - So good we got two orders of it. Fresh agnolotti pasta with a generous portion of white truffle. SO GOOD!3) I ordered the Grilled Sonoma Lamb Chops - These were incredible and perfect for the Insignia wine that we ordered. :)4) My girlfriend ordered the Honey Miso Broiled Japanese Black Cod which she loved as well.We unfortunately were too full for dessert but will opt for it next time around.I would highly recommend doing a dinner here for whatever occasion, solid food that you can expect great quality from.For the lounge:I've been here many times now and love every bit of it. This is the first lounge in Singapore that I feel operates the way a lounge should - great wine and drinks, great bar snacks/food, great music, great service in a very comfortable and airy environment. It is run very efficiently and they hire good people to take great care of you. Come here for even one beer and you'll see that you can just let your hair down and enjoy yourself, something I find a rarity in with Singapore drinking culture. It truly feels like they brought in an LA or Miami type classy casual spot into Singapore and totally nailed it.They have the Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones here so make sure to get those while sipping one of their delicious cocktails. The sliders and langoustine are very good. The California Roll uses real crab and is very delicious despite a more expensive price tag. And for the sweet tooths out there, they serve a really good Halo Halo dessert.THEY ARE OPEN LATE AFTER MIDNIGHT TOO!Totally check this place out. Very highly recommend for a solid date night cocktail or a casual hangout with friends.",

Greeted by the hostesses at the front we were not asked if we were there for dinner or just drinks and were quickly ushered to a table in the bar area. Without knowing it was only an appetizer menu we ordered a few things. I had the potstickers which were absolutely delicious. The flavor was perfect and the sauce very good as well. When delivered to our table we were shocked at the size (as we were still thinking it was dinner). Our waitress (Nadezda) did nothing to make this a great experience. She did not offer to explain the drink or food menu, only came back to the table to collect the dirty plates and bring us the bill. For a restaurant that is owned by someone as prestigious as Wolfgang Puck I would expect both the food and service to be top notch. Our waitress Nadezda was one of the most rude, stuck up and overall worst waitresses I have ever had. Her overall bad attitude and terrible service greatly impeded us from having a wonderful time. If you go here just keep this in mind.",

Had the tuna tataki cones, fried chicken, grilled cheese sandwich, and my girlfriends had the mochi waffles which were supposed to be really good. I had the first cocktail on the menu, super light and refreshing. Service was really top notch. Every time I used a napkin and put it on the table, it vanished. Whenever water was half empty, it was filled up right away. This is the kind of service that I think Singapore needs. Anyway, trying their dinner tonight for my brother in law's birthday. Will keep you updated, but highly recommend for drinks and finger food! And probably do dinner for big celebrations :)",

    "text": "Perched atop the famous Marina Bay Sands is Spago, a Wolfgang Puck restaurant\u00a0that has locations around the world. My personal favorite is the Beverly Hills location but the Singapore location has the best views by far.I went for lunch and made a 12pm reservation in hopes of dodging the suits that were sure to fill the dining area later in the afternoon. Getting to the top of MBS is always an adventure and I got lost as I took the wrong elevator in Tower 2 (which only took me to the 22nd floor) but eventually made it to the top after three elevator transfers. The proposed route involves two elevator transfers so keep an eye out for the lifts that take you up to the 55th floor in Tower 2 and then take a second lift up to the 57th floor. Upon arriving you'll see the Spago Bar and Lounge to your right and the fine dining area to your left. Straight ahead you'll see glimpses of the mouth-dropping view through the welcome area.The fine dining area has a dress code of business casual and I saw many people turned away for wearing flip flops or swim gear (the restaurant shares a roof with an infinity pool) so I put on a decent dress with slip on sneakers. It seemed to work just fine and I was seated promptly by the window which overlooks the water where you can watch the ships hang out just past the Gardens by the Bay.The staff were so nice and didn't seem to mind me, a lone blogger, taking a table all to myself. The interior of the dining room is gorgeous with white table cloths and a beautiful orchid center piece. It honestly seemed a lot classier than the Beverly Hills Spago and WAY classier than the Las Vegas Spago (which I think shut down -- good riddance.) I was presented with a very luxe a la carte menu for lunch but opted to go with the Express Prix Fixe: 3 Courses for $45.The Express Lunch is quite the deal as I recently paid $36 just for one Singapore Sling. I also got my favorite cocktail, Peace on Earth, for an extra $25. I originally ordered the tuna cones but they already had one made for me so I swapped out my first course for the Chicken 'Laksa' Spring Roll per the recommendation of the staff. This appetizer is unique to the Singapore Spago and I'm really glad I made the swap.I wasn't sure I wanted anything fried but the spring rolls were cooked to perfection and filled with a warm Asian flavors with a thicker curry texture. There is a delicious coconut flavor\u00a0that lingered with each bite. I didn't see coconut listed as part of the dish so perhaps I imagined it. Whatever it was, it was great. I enjoyed the tuna cone but it paled in comparison to the Spring Rolls.Next, I got the Steamed Red Snapper. It looked absolutely stunning. The fish was cooked well and the garnish tasted of a light soy sauce and was\u00a0enjoyable on its own. It's served with a side of rice which was tasty. I tested the sauce that was on the side but I wasn't a fan so I skipped it. I will say that the flavors of the dish, while delicious, were clearly on or around the fish. If you're looking for a fish with deep flavors infused into every bite, you wont get it with this Snapper. However, if you're like me and you appreciate the natural taste of fish, it's pretty good.Finally, it was time for dessert. Each Express Lunch comes with a Pistachio Panna Cotta. On a hot day, this dessert is truly refreshing with orange flavors all over the panna cotta. There's a lot going on on top of the actual dessert (candied this and that) but the orange gelato was fantastic and the panna cotta itself (ignoring the Pistachio Brittle and other toppings) was divine.\u00a0The quality of food, decor, and service at Spago never disappoints\u00a0(except in Vegas) and I would highly recommend going to Spago for a business lunch or a special occasion. If you only plan to go to Singapore once, definitely go to Spago for either dinner or just head to the lounge. If you come to Singapore often, it's not a must unless you are in the mood for stunning views paired with delicious views. I'll probably be back at some point.TOTAL COST: $83.5757th Floor of Marina Bay Sands, Tower 2SingaporeThis is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews.",

Dumplings, KBLT, and Soft Omelet were all delicious. KBLT was really really good. \u00a0Only two issues with the place. \u00a0The Tuna Tartare cones were off and we sent them back. \u00a0They did come right off the bill, so all good there. \u00a0The second is the (typical for Singapore) disinterested level of service. \u00a0We had several long, awkward service gaps which required us to flag down our (often absent) waiter. \u00a0 We had to ask for more water, etc. \u00a0It was a non-stop cavalcade of flagging down wait staff to handle things which should have been handled. \u00a0While annoying, this is what I have come to expect in Singapore so I only get mildly annoyed now that my expectations have been beaten into shape.",

    "text": "As a part of our stay at Marina Bay Sands, we were looking forward to the dining options offered at such a luxurious place. During the time of our stay we were told that they were in midst of constructing a new dining area and there were a few choices to choose from, one of which was Spago. Spago is located on the 57th floor, which is where the infinity pool is located. We were seated immediately upon arrival and introduced to the breakfast buffet offerings. The space inside was kind of cramped with the amount of guests and servers walking back and forth. The breakfast area was quite limited and selection smaller than what I expected. There was cheese and charcuterie, fruits, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, smoked salmon, greens, muffins, and croissants. Juice, milk, coffee, and tea were also available. Our server came by to take our orders for the hot menu items once we were done with the self serve items. We ordered an omelet and smoked salmon eggs benedict. When the eggs came out we were surprised to find a small omelet and a very small eggs benedict dish. When I order benedicts, I expect an order to have two. However, Spago only gives one...kind of strange in my opinion. A few minutes after receiving those hot items, we got the bill slapped onto our table. I understand that they are busy and are trying their best to get hotel guests in and out of the dining area, but come on. The smoked salmon eggs benedict was delicious albeit shameful for such a fancy place (but had a superb buttery flavor). The omelet was your typical omelet with whatever meats and veggies you wanted to add. I'm not sure if Marina Bay Sands will continue to utilize the same restaurant to serve breakfast to its guests after its new constructions but we thought that this was the least appealing part of our stay.I can't speak for dinner service here but the pro I got from my experience was the view from the skyscraper.",

You are somewhat secluded and separated from the rest of the masses that seek out the infinity pool below you which is comforting. And the interior certainly has an air or sophistication about it that keeps it classy. My dinner was excellent though the portions were on the lean side for the price. That being said, I'd eat there tomorrow any time. But the ambience was rather sterile. May be it was a just a quiet boring crowd, us included. The price of the wine was laughable. I'd rather leave with a better taste in my mouth than a bitter feeling of being robbed. It kind of tarnished the whole experience for me. Mind you, that is kind of the vibe I get from being at the Marina Bay Sands anyway. A kind of \"Give us your money and go\" feeling.",

I thought the food was going to be subpar and overpriced. To my surprise, I was wrong. Our waitress was fantastic and super friendly. The staff here clearly know the food on the menu well, and seemed to have tried all the dishes, so they were able to make great recommendations.Here are a few reasons to come:-Amazing view, it is right by the pool. Instead of paying to go to the pool to enjoy the view, why not com here instead?-The prie fixe lunch menu won't break the bank, it is $45. -The food is creative and good.Let's start with the atmosphere. The windows were huge and bright, allowing you to enjoy the sunshine and take in the view of the beautiful Singapore skyline. There is a huge vase with hanging orchids in the middle of the room. The open kitchen is great, you can watch the chefs prepare your food. Also, the bathrooms are great. There are individual private stalls. Let's talk about the food. Appetizers:Chicken 'Laksa' Spring Roll: This was my favorite appetizer. The flavor was unique. I've never had such a delicious spring roll before and would highly recommend it. Pan Seared Pork Dumplings: This was good too, but you can easily get pork dumplings anywhere. Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones: I felt as if I was eating a tiny ice cream cone filled with tuna tartare. The presentation was beautiful. You definitely should order this.Main Course: Grilled Iberico Pork. The pork was cooked to perfection, it was so tender and juicy. Desert: Pistachio Panna Cotta Amazing.After eating your meal, you can take some great pics by the pool. Don't worry, there are no rude staff from Ce La Vie to tell you that you cannot take pictures unless you get bottle service. You are free to stand there as long as you like to take photos!",

    "text": "I have taken quite a few visiting friends to CE LA VI however, I never really liked it: service is very average and f&b offerings are generally disappointing . But obviously you are there for the amazing view. Why no-one ever told me before that there is a much better alternative is a puzzle to me!!Spago Bar & Lounge is simply AWESOME:- the view is in my opinion even better than CLV, you can see the whole of Marina Bay plus you get to see the well known MBS infinity pool.- the service is on point, from the person picking up the phone over the hostess to the waiters, all were really helpful and pro-active.- the food is amazing, who would have thought that a tourist trap such as the MBS rooftop serves on of the BEST burgers in Singapore? And the Tuna Tartare cones are to die for!- the drinks are really great, I am known to be quite picky on my cocktails. Both the Hot Legs and Grin n Bare It were fantastic.The only downside is that they do not serve Ranch Dressing to go with their otherwise delicious burger and fries. I honestly cannot wait to try the other snacks of the bar menu and their full restaurant menu.So I can tell you, you won't see me again at CE LA VI anytime soon - unless Calvin Harris (preferably doused in Ranch) comes and invites me personally.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by our experience at Spago by Wolfgang Puck at the Marina Bay Sands. \u00a0After all, this was the tourist attraction in Singapore located in a hotel and casino complex with numerous restaurants and bars. \u00a0However, having just viewed a documentary on Netflix on the world's great hotels, I gained some incredible insight into the inner workings of this giant city in the sky. \u00a0Spago is located on the Sky Park which you can access via elevator in tower 2. \u00a0It'll take you up to the 50 something floor where you'll need to transfer to another set of elevators to take you all the way up to the top. \u00a0Don't be surprised when you exit the first set of elevators directly into a lounge. \u00a0Just turn left and head toward the other set of elevators. \u00a0Once on the Sky Park level, you'll have two options. \u00a0If you're a guest of the hotel, you're keycard will give you access to the pool area...however, if you're like most of us, you can only line up at Spago. \u00a0Once at the front of the line, they should in theory ask you if you're there for dinner or drinks and I assume if you're there for dinner you probably already have a reservation. \u00a0We were there for dessert. \u00a0They'll seat you pretty far away from the edge, so if you want to take pictures of the Singapore skyline or the Gardens by the Bay, don't be afraid to get up and move around.The bar menu was small and expensive, but the flavors were on point or at least what we had. \u00a0Just to illustrate how much expensive the menu is, two small orders of a granita type dessert cost more than our four lunch and dinner combined. \u00a0However, price aside you're there really for the ambiance and they do have that in abundance. \u00a0It's a cross between LA hipster and Vegas glam. \u00a0It's not for everyone, but it's worth a visit just as the Marina Bay Sands is worth a visit while in Singapore.",

Eating from the 57th floor is amazing, and really shows off how Singapore is a major port as you look out the windows and see a city of boats anchored offshore.The atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasant as its very sophisticated, yet relaxed that you aren't afraid if you following etiquette to a T.The prices here are higher as you'd expect as you are eating in the Hotel/Casino establishment, just like you'd expect in Las Vegas.The food was phenomenal. The Singapore touch of spices and seasoning was delectable on the classic Snapper Laksa. Our desserts and appetizers were also very tasty.We did fall for the sparkling or flat water technique, but they do have tap water if you ask for it.Overall, if you don't want to venture out of the hotel and only want to take the elevator ride up, I would definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "The restaurant was located at level 57 of Marina Bay Sands. One had to take the lift at Tower 2 to level 55 before changing another lift to level 57. The restaurant overlooked the swimming with a nice view of the city. I was showed to a table indoor by the window, but the view was blocked by the green. I was having the 3-course restaurant week lunch ($40++). I was served an assorted of bread rolls consisted of mini-sized French baguette and Rustic Italian Ciabatta Bread Roll, stuffed with dried fruits, served with salted and unsalted butter on a marble slab. Both rolls were crusty and soft inside. I personally preferred the ciabatta roll with the salted butter which enhanced the sweetness of the dried fruit's taste.Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones (ala carte $36++/ 3pieces)Chili Aioli, Soy, Wasabi, Shaved Bonito, Scallions, MasagoThe raw tuna was refreshing, combined with the crunchy and slighty spicy cone. However I felt the wasabi taste came across a tab too strong.Soft French Omelet (ala carte $28++)Field Mushrooms, Gruyere Cheese, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Arugula SaladCut opened, the inside of the omelet was filled with melted cheese and soften shiitake mushroom slices. The baby potato's taste was greatly enhanced by the shaved cheese on top.Coconut-Passion Fruit TrifleCoconut Mousse, Almond-Nutmeg Meringue, Passion Fruit CreamIt looked simple, but the taste and texture was a combination of crispy crunchy rice crisp, sour raspberries, rich creamy coconut mousse and creamy almond cream.Finished the meal with a pot of White Tea ($10++), which was light and refreshing. It was served with some biscuits.Overall the food was great. Service was great too with the staffs checking on the food from time to time. The only con was the noisy table of Indonesians sitting next to me, making a headache growing inside me.",
