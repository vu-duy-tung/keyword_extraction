Its chicken soup is denser that Din Tai Fung's. Also, Bario is a classic that will fill up the stomach for sure.",

    "text": "Ramen junkies, UNITE!So it's a one-stop variety show of ramen, Singapore style. Of course we had contests, and these are the champions... but who crowned them? Anyhow, at the original Bugis (Iluma) location, you can find six contenders, ranging from the hokkaido butter and corn style, to the tsukemen, and even jiro makes an appearance. I was a bit of a cop-out on my first visit, so I stuck to good ol' tonkotsu based Ikkousha, that also has the Hakata noodles that I nom with great delight. Tasty stuff. I've been back several times now, and enjoyed almost everything else, except Menya Iroha's Black Shoyu ramen, because either the queue is too long, or they're sold out, and... the jiro. I travelled 30 minutes by train once to try it in Tokyo, and as I ate it... I realised it really wasn't for me. A mountain of thick, doughy noodles, and the garlic? I couldn't finish. It's something to try though, so don't let my experience spoil yours. If you can, I'd say you're truly a champ.",

    "text": "This could be my new favorite ramen place in Singapore. I visited it for the first time last week and I tried Bario ramen. It was advertised as a ramen for man, and it lived up to its expectation. I personally love hard, thin noodles, so I was a bit worried when I learned that Bario's use thick ones. To my pleasant surprise, the noodles were just heavenly. It was hard and chewy, and very 'manly.' The broth was the key; I love garlic and Bario's broth was just overloaded with it and you can even add some more extra garlic yourself. The char siew was not bad, nothing special. A tip: If you don't like your ramen with beansprouts, remember to notify the guy when you first order. The ramen comes with a ton of it and to me, beansprouts just destroy the texture of the ramen.Le wife tried the 2011 champion, which was Ikkousha. I tried 1 bite of it and I wasn't impressed tbh. But I think it's just because my mouth and taste buds were 'destroyed' by Bario's manly ramen which just overpowered Ikkousha's.I'll definitely be back and try all the other stalls in the future.",

I'm not too sure if it is just the scaled down version of the originals? The ingredients? The chefs? But be forewarned, you get very very mediocre ramen here. I come here when I feel like having ramen, just ramen and nothing else. Have your ramen with their lava eggs, those are good.I recommend having gyozas with your ramen too. Gyozas never fail.",

Nice idea to make the whole experience faster: you'll be given a bracelet that you scan when you order on any ramen counter that you choose and drink counter, give the bracelet later to the cashier to find out your total. It's constructed like a market where you can walk around and there're multiple stalls inside - I think you can find any ramen that you can imagine here, so you may have to visit this place several times to actually try all. It's a very nice idea since you can spend a whole day here trying different kind of ramen at 1 place, but our party don't find anything that taste really great.",

    "text": "This was quite a confusing experience. Firstly, the stores that many Yelpers mentioned in the reviews seemed to have been replaced? There was no Bario or Ayoma for eg. There're 6 stores in total, and you can see a list of them at the far right of the whole area. Secondly, there were so many choices and I couldn't really tell the difference between the different ramens. Which bothered me because they can't all be as good right? The staff of each store are also pretttttty aggressive as you browse, and keep asking you what you'd like to order. The ramen, for a store named Ramen Champion, was decent but substandard. and for the price of $15 for mine, I doubt I'll be back again when there are so many better options - even Keisuke Four Seasons at Bugis Village. I ordered the Hokkaido style black garlic ramen. Interestingly the thin slices of pork are layered around the bowl. The soup was fragrant without being overly oily and greasy. The egg was perfectly done, which I unfortunately can't say for some ramen places in Singapore...and the noodles were alright, the thin-cut straight noodles best known as the type at Ippudo. Overall it tasted alright, satisfactory, checked the boxes for decent ramen, but not something I would come back for. There wasn't anything particularly special about the taste of it, particularly the broth. I felt that it was a waste of calories, but oh well. Disclaimer: I'm picky about ramen and don't think it's worth eating unless it's really good.",

There are several choices a styles to choose from. I went for baisen shoyu. Extra egg for me too because I love a good soy marinated egg! I came a bit before the lunch rush because the place really filled up around me. There's free wifi and the password is on the wall by the drink stall.

This is something like marche whereby they swipe cards and pay it when you are about to leave. The price of the ramen is rather expensive but it is worth to try.

    "text": "Two new popular Tonkotsu brands from Japan, namely Mendokoro Aoi and Tonkotsu Itto have been handpicked by Ramen Champion from Gunma and Tokyo respectively. We had quite a good start with the appetizers, Prawn Dipping Sauce with Cracker($4) from Mendokoro Aoi and Gyoza ($6) from Tonkotsu Itto. The Prawn Dipping Sauce tasted quite mild (didn't really have the prawn-like flavor), but overall it still tasted good with the cracker.The gyoza was pretty good, considering the fact that it specialize in ramen though I would prefer gyozas at Osaka Ohsho.Next up, one of the highlights at the food tasting, Mendokoro Aoi's Tonkotsu-Ramen Champion ($16.50) by Chef Kazuo Sakuraoka. The ramen presentation did reduce my excitement a little, however the white cloudy ramen broth was nice, light, flavorful. It does not contain the smell of pork bones. It's one of the lighter tonkotsu broth which I've tried thus far. If you love tonkotsu but don't like some of the heavier, oilier versions elsewhere, you might like Mendokoro Aoi. Perhaps one of the few minus points would be it was served rather lukewarm, not piping hot as I expected. The Chashu was slightly overcooked thus a tad too soft for my preference, though the thin layers of fat literally melts in my mouth. Well, at least the noodles were not too overcooked. Strangely, the Ajitama (flavoured egg) was under-cooked with runny egg whites. In contrast, Tonkotsu Itto's Special Tonkotsu Ramen ($16.50) (by Chef Yukihiko Sakamoto) is prepared in the traditional tonkotsu way where the pork-based soup is cooked for several hours to allow the essence of the pork bone to fill up the base. The ramen looks very appetizing (as compared to Aoi) and the portion was generous here, with big slices of tender Chashu conquering half the entire surface of the bowl. I felt a tinge of disappointment after tasting the broth though this Hakata style of ramen (albeit originated from Tokyo) boasts the taste of rich pork-bone tonkotsu broth with rather thin, non-curly, resilient noodles. Like in most ramen-ya, \u00a0the use of Chashu is not restricted to ramen. A pretty good side dish was Mendokoro Aoi's Chashu Carpaccio($7)--a sliced chashu salad garnished with tomatoes, onions and peanuts. Currently, the 6 ramen brands that we have are Tonkotsu Itto, Mendokoro Aoi, Menban Yamagishi Kazuo, Buta God, Gantetsu and Bario! For this latest battle between Mendokoro Aoi and Tonkotsu Itto, my vote goes to Mendokoro Aoi's for its broth as well as its springy, chewy noodles which were a notch above Itto's. I could not get used to the taste of egg noodles in Itto's version though its chashu won me over",

Last night, after bidding some friends goodbye at the InterContinental hotel, I stumbled into Bugis+ having not been there before for a casual wander. Dinnertime approached, & I followed my nose up to the food area.Greeting me just around the escalator was the huge signboard claiming 6 ramen champion chefs from all over Japan. Being a huge fan of ramen, & on a personal quest to find the best ramen outside Japan, how could I resist? Here I reached a quandary; 6 restaurants, one stomach. What should I do? Do I roll a dice? Do I rely on the classic playground method of eenie-meenie-miney-mo? Should I phone a friend? Can I ask the audience??Wandering around lost, like a kid in a candy store, I had almost made up my mind based on some photos of bowls of ramen when the chef at Bario calls out to me. I tell him honestly that I'm lost for choice. He points at the standard ramen from his shop. Feeling a bit obligated, having been locked in a brief and polite conversation, I bite the bullet & go for the recommendation, even though the picture didn't look as appealing as the other one I was going to go for initially.5 minutes later, my buzzer beeps, & I collect my giant bowl of ramen, with a mountain of bean sprouts heaping from the top. I hate bean sprouts. Nevermind, I take an extra bowl so I can remove them. There is a lot of bean sprouts. A LOT. Did I mention I hate bean sprouts? I hate bean sprouts.The moment of truth, with most of the bean sprouts removed (because I hate bean sprouts), I stir up the noodles & ingredients into the soup. The aroma of garlic slices through the smoke, making me immediately forget about the heap of bean sprouts that I've just removed. I dip my spoon into the soup, & bring it to my lips. Thick, delicious tonkatsu soup. I approve. Next, the noodles. As I politely slurp a mouthful from my chopsticks, I am slightly surprised by how thick & firm the noodles are. I'm used to thinner, soggier ramen noodles. This was quite different. Different, but so good. I could get used to this.So the basics, the soup & noodles were pretty damn convincing. How about the ingredients? I pick up the solid brown egg, not really impressed as it looks like a regular tea egg. I was wrong. Before my teeth even met in the middle of the egg, I realised how soft the inside was. Just the way ramen egg should be. My vision blurred a little from the tears that were welling up in my eyes. I'm not even exaggerating. Time for the cha-shu.Oh my god, the cha-shu. Meaty, fatty, and soaked through with flavour. It's like I died & went to heaven & god is a cha-shu. With every mouthful closer to an empty bowl, I curse the fact that I was born with only one stomach, & may have seriously contemplated throwing up everything I ate just so that I could try another stall's ramen. I decided against, but guess what I'm having for dinner tonight? ;)",

    "text": "The reason why it's called a Ramen Champion is this: Each of the stalls compete against each other to tabulate their sales and votes at the end of each year, and the winner gets to set up a restaurant in Singapore. The question why would they want to set up a restaurant in Singapore is beyond me, we don't charge as high as Japan does... hmm... the only reason must be that Singaporeans love our ramen.The ramen stalls here have some kind of standards, they've got either pictures of queues pasted outside their counters, or articles gushing about their prestigious rankings in Japan. I felt the layout of the stalls was a little bit unfair, because it gets quieter as you walk towards the end of the place, and the two stalls at the back don't get that 'bustling atmosphere' in front. Well, regardless which stall you choose, the quality should be pretty okay. One thing I noticed is that their noodles are all about the same, the thick and yellow kind, not the kind of ramen I prefer. And they come in mega portions.",

    "text": "If you love ramen but can't decide where to get your fix from. This is where you head to. Though I have to warn you that after getting a table here, you're gonna me perplexed again at which one you should get. This is where all the good ramen gather and you're gonna find yourself coming back here to try them all.First off, the portions are pretty big and I really couldn't finish the bowl at all. But le bf managed to polish off both mine and his portions so maybe it's just me and my small appetite for carbs.The broth was really spicy and I would say that it was perfect for the slightly too cold air conditioning in the mall. I actually felt a little fuzzy inside and there are not many food out there that can give me that feeling.The star of this place is apparently the Menya Iroha's Black Shoyu Ramen but the queue is ridiculously long and I have no patience for things like that so I don't think I would ever try it unless there's no queue or whoever I'm eating with decides to queue.",

After walking endless rounds I got tired and just ordered from the stall closest to where I sat.That happened to be the Aoyama ramen stall. I wasnt exactly blown away by it though. It tasted pretty average to me and I had to get my friend to grab me some garlic from the Bario stall so that I could add a little bit more kick into my ramen.The noodles were ok and so was the char siew. I also ordered the Gyoza. It was decent but not the best I've had.",

I reckon this is as close or as good to authentic Japanese ramen can get, ramen from Japan that is. Anyway, I was there for dinner after work. The place wasn't too packed out, it was free sitting. You get a \"credit card\" like you would at March\u00e9, because all the stalls do not handle money, you pay at check out.I had the tsukemen from Tai Sho Ken, it was not too bad. To be honest, it was my first experience eating that variation. A spicy soup for dipping your ramen into. It was good, portions were okay. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area.",
