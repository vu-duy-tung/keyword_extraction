    "text": "I choose this space for high tea with mom due to the view and sentimental reasons. My dad (and his dad) brought us here for tea before it was a luxury hotel. The fact that my bank had a discount going on was also nice. Have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the space. It's much less obvious than the main hall and feels like a quiet nook with views across the water to MBS. The ladies were exceptional in their service and all the lovely snacks were refilled upon requested. My mom loved the lobster tart but as I nearly bit into a piece of shell I stopped after one. The salted caramel tart is to die for but after that you are kinda done with food. It's that rich... All in all a good way to spend the afternoon getting fed little morsels of food and enjoy the view on a not so hot day. I think when it's super sunny it won't be as nice to sit in the atrium. It's is a trade off though: comfortable low couch or high chairs with a great view. Have to say the savoury bites did not disappoint and a good balance with the sweet stuff. Yes. I'm one of those weird ones that don't like too much dessert with my tea.",

From the top tier to bottom (left to right)- Creme Brulee, Chocolate Tart, Cucumber sandwich, Brie on Biscuit, Parma Ham Mini Bagel, Truffled Egg Mayo, Smoked Salmon sandwich, Lobster horn, Mini Ham and Cheese Quiche, Duck confit in Crepe, Kueh Lapis, Canele, Tarte Citron and Chocolate \u00c9clair. Any tea is incomplete without English Scones of course and they were served with Strawberry Jam and Clotted Cream (YAY!). A fine selection of fresh tea and infusions by TWG is available e.g. Eau Noir Tea, Honeyed White Tea, Tea Party Tea etc. If you wanna do tea, they have one of the best all rounder afternoon tea sets around. All items are refillable. My favorites are the lobster horn, quiche, duck confit, tart citron and scones! Perfect place to while your time away. Best tai tai tea around!",

This place is beautifully decorated with bright mosaic and big crystal chandelier.There is a pianist playing jazz live.The Truffle egg mayo, \u00a0Kueh Lapis, duck confit in crepe goes perfectly with Weekend in Shanghai(TWG).Lemon tart is overly sweetened and the cucumber sandwich is a bit bland. It's a beautiful place with a great view to share the tasty petites with your friend, family or just having a romantic afternoon tea with your partner.",

    "text": "First confession, I love this hotel. I love the smell in the lobby, so much so that I actually asked the staff what scent they use and it's a custom blend of 5 flowers. So I guess I can't hope for my house to smell like the Fullerton Bay Hotel lobby.I have only been here for evening cocktails. It's a nice quiet spot along the bay that I never had any problem finding a seat even on a Friday evening. The free bar snacks are more premium than your average bar.Grab one of the comfy patio sofas outdoors and you get to see MBS in front of you. The view is not as nice as The Lantern as it is situated at ground level, but it is also a lot quieter than Lantern. And much less showy and dressy.So it depends on how you want to spend your evening, or how old your soul is.",

The wine came a bit too warm though, my friend is somewhat of a wine expert (I am useless in these regards... so don't ask me lol) and he had them cool the bottle down a little bit. It tasted wonderful though and that's as good of an expertise as I can give.One small thing: Voss Sparkling Water seems to be hip now in Singapore (haven't noticed that anywhere else yet) but I find it completely unnecessary. An upscale Restaurant should at least offer Pellegrino. Keep it classy people!Service was attentive and friendly. Short before we left afternoon tea started but I had another dinner scheduled that night so with a tearful eye I had to pass the tables with one after the other delicious Etagere.I will be back for one of those!CheersS.",
