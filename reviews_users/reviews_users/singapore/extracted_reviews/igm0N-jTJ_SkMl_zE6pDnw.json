    "text": "To be straightforward: Superstar K is generous with their side dishes and napkins. They also serve the softest pork belly and tastiest kimchi jjigae I've had in Singapore yet. Let's talk banchan. Their kimchi is fresh and is one of the most legit batch around town. The seasoned bean sprouts were salty yet yummy. The seasoned anchovies were the saltiest and must be accompanied with something bland (ie: steamed egg, rice or wraps). The fish cakes were mild while the potato salad was slightly sweet and perfectly soft like mashed potato. While other K-restaurants tend to serve bland side dishes, Superstar K isn't shy to make their banchan take the spotlight. I thoroughly enjoyed the signature King Galbi due to its just-enough-chewiness and not-too-sweet marinade, however my foodie partner preferred the sweet marinated short ribs from Han Kook Gwan more (they were also fresher). To each man his own. We both agreed that the Kimchi Jjigae is one of the most delicious and flavorful we've tried in Singapore. It is like the ones served in Los Angeles' Koreatown. Spicy yet in a sophisticated way. Typically Korean restaurants play Kpop music videos on their television screen. At Superstar K, it's \"Wreck It Ralph\" on replay. I love that movie, but my eyes prefer to feast on Kpop while eating K-food! And if I were eating Indian food, I'd want to watch Bollywood films not Cinderella. Verdict: I'd come back to Superstar K for their Pork Belly, King Galbi and Kimchi Jjigae. And you should, too. However I give a C for Ventilation (my hair smelled of KBBQ for the rest of the night up until I woke up in the next morning). But I'd still go back for the King Galbi again and again :D",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday night at 11pm for a Korean barbecue fix, and we left tummies filled and happy.We got the pork belly and seasoned beef ribs sets and kimchi jjigae. The first set of side dishes here are free, and an additional top-up costs $5. Side dishes include: mashed potatoes, beansprouts, baby anchovies, spicy beancurd sheets, and kimchi. We had no complaints with the side dishes and the meats, of which lettuce and garlic was provided abundantly for us to eat the meats with. The staff were also pretty good at cooking the meats for us; we did not have to lift a finger at all. We washed the food down with a kettle of makgeolli, of which they gave us chilled bowls to drink from. Makgeolli is served plain, and there are no flavors to choose from. Goes well with grilled meat and isn't very strong.I wasn't too happy with the kimchi soup, because there wasn't enough kimchi and it was rather bland. I would come back here again, but would skip ordering the kimchi soup. As with all K-bbq places, expect to go out smelling of food. I don't own an Hermes handbag, but I wouldn't take one here if I were you! :pP.S. Free wifi here.",

The host, perhaps owner was not welcoming at all and the only time he expressed some energy was presenting the bill to see if we'd leave a tip, a first time for me that I didn't. Do yourself a favor and try to other shops on this great foodie street, this one is now a sleeper zzzzzNever take customers for granted",

The ban chan was also very good and high quality, although not much variety. The Korean food staple potato salad was also involved which I thought was only a Cali thing.The lettuce leaves were fresh, the soups were tasty, the steamed egg was awesome.

Their meat is GOOD and of high quality, their banchan (side dishes) are diverse, and their other non-meat dishes are tasty as well. I've been here three times so far and have never been disappointed!Other than the bbq meat, i recommend their steamed egg, sliced pork with beansprout, seafood pancake and their spicy rice cake dish.You do need to book ahead of time though, because they are popular and the place is small. Also their tables are not flexible (permanently fixed) so if you come in a group more than 4-5, you'd be seated on separate tables.",

    "text": "My favorite Korean bbq place in Singapore. I usually go for two servings of the unseasoned beef ribs, the meat is very high quality and there is no need to drench it in seasonings and mask the flavor. The waitresses grill the beef for you at the table. Each table is fixed in position and can fit from 1 - 6 or so people. They bring fresh charcoal to grill the meat before the meal.You also get a free steamed egg dish with your meal. Basically a steaming pot overflowing with egg is delivered to your table soon after you place your order. It looks intimidatingly large, but it is light and serves as a good appetizer. Another winning dish is the cold noodles in chilled broth, which comes in a huge silver mixing bowl complete with thin slices of beef and a boiled egg inside. Vinegar and mustard are provided to adjust for taste. It's a nice contrast to the heavier beef dishes to end the meal.No reservations and the place is popular, so you will probably be looking at a wait if you go during peak eating hours. No worries though, put your number down, grab a beer nearby and they'll give you a buzz when your table is ready. 20-30 minutes wait is common.",

    "text": "Have tried a few places for Korean BBQ in Singapore and this is one of the best! This store is pretty small so there will be a wait list if you come during the weekends. The parking was difficult as there are other restaurants and pubs nearby. Sitting outside while waiting for your table might make you sick of smelling the cigarette smells. The downside of waiting till you are seated is when most of your party have not arrive. They will only give you a table when most of the people in your party has arrived. The maximum amount for a party is 10.This place served a lot of side dishes (kimchi, steamed egg, bean sprouts, anchovies, potato salad and sliced fish cakes). All of them are extremely delicious!! The taste, the texture are in perfect blend. You will at least ask for two rounds for the side dishes.My party ordered pork belly, chicken and cubed beef. It was delicious!! The waitress will help you flip the meat and put on new batch of meat after you are done with it. The customer service was good here.Overall, I like this restaurant and will be back for more with different batch of friends. It is highly encouraged if you use public transport instead of driving there yourselves. Like I mentioned earlier, parking was terrible. Enjoy your delicacy here :) Cheers!!",
