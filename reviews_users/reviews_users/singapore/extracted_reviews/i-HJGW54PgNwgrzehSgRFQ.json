    "text": "Aussie Roll is absolutely fantastic! They have cheap sushi rolls of a huge variety of flavours - beats the other big sushi chains around the area hands down! They have fillings such as teriyaki chicken, bulgolgi beef, soft shell crab, and also the traditional tuna, salmon and vegetarian options. \u00a0As everything is prepared already, the line although quite long at lunch time moves very quickly, and you can either eat the entire roll as it is, or have the servers cut it up into smaller pieces for you. Also love how they leave the packets of soy sauce and wasabi outside for you to help yourself, so you don't have to keep going back to the counter to ask for more, and also give you a packet of tissues with your purchase. Very classy. I always forget to bring a packet of tissues with me when I'm out for lunch so it comes in very handy indeed!Also, they have a buy 2 get 1 free promotion every day after 6.30 or 7pm (can't remember exactly) - but it's a great deal so if you are still around raffles place at that time, drop by to pick them up!",

    "text": "I found my favorite rolls to order:- salmon avocado for the typical sushi- spicy soy chicken for the incredible slightly spicy and a tad sweet sauce. The chicken could be more tender but the sauce helps to make any hard bits palatable. Rolls which I want to try but have not- seaweed salad- garlic king prawns- calamariI like how this place runs like clockwork. The line may be long but it moves very quickly, so don't be put off by that. I usually get it to go as the place is too small for dining in, plus the tables are usually taken.While waiting in line, stare at the big poster board on the wall to think of what to order. Once you get to the display cases, you will need to tell them what you want. A bit hard to try looking at the actual rolls at the two display cases and then tell them as you do not want to hold up the lunch crowd line. Tell them how many rolls you are getting first so they can get the correct size box for you. And say yes when asked if you want them cut (sliced) unless you like to hold it in your fist and eat it like a wrap.",

Prices range between 2,6 till 3S$ and each roll is cut into 4 pieces. The sushi is really fresh and in the evening after 6pm it is happy hour: buy 2, get 1 free. It is a great place for fresh and tasty sushi, but you only find the classic maki, no other types are served here.",

    "text": "I think this place has a great concept, but compared to Maki-San at Dhoby Ghaut, Aussie Roll falls short.The Good:- Each roll is around $2.40-$2.80 so relatively cheap. Plus, after 6:00 PM they do a buy 2 get one free deal. Perfect for those after workout quick fix.- The rolls can be cut into four slices or eaten like a handroll.- Unlimited supply of wasabi, soy sauce, and utensils. There's also a sink for you to wash your hands! Ginger and mayo do cost extra though.The Bad:- There's no alternative healthy options, ie brown rice. If you're a health nut, then I think you'll be limited to very few options.- The queue can be relatively long during lunch hours.A great, cost-effective option for fake sushi lovers like myself!",

    "text": "I'm pretty divided on Aussie Roll. The concept is great in theory, but it fell short on the quality-to-value scale. Aussie Roll basically caters to the average, rushed office employee who needs a quick lunch that's fuss free, inexpensive and portable. For those who don't like raw food, would like more protein and dislike vegetables, the cooked meat rolls *look* delicious and helpings are generous compared to say SSB, your average supermarket sushi roll or the mass market restaurant chains. It's relatively cheap too. So basically these are tummy fillers for the rushed.What I didn't like about the food was \u00a0that there wasn't much effort put into the flavors and it felt like I was eating a soulless, mass produced roll. If you've had some of the fast fusion food coming out the food truck scene in the U.S (mind you, I dislike making cross country comparisons but this felt especially relevant) for example, a bulgogi sub or taco cone can still taste excellent if you had each of the ingredients on it's own. That wasn't the case here with the rolls as a whole or with the ingredients pieced apart, which is what I ended up doing when I realized it was going to be a chore to finish my lunch.I had the beef bulgogi, teriyaki chicken, spicy prawn and salmon avocado. First thing that hit me was the rice was pretty bland, coarse and slap dashed together. Even for a supermarket sushi type chain, this seemed like a big flaw to me because 50% of sushi is the rice and you're serving it to Asians. The meats weren't great either - the beef bulgogi was tough and crumbly, that and the teriyaki chicken was too salty. The seaweed, was you guessed it, soft and rather tasteless.To save the day though, the aunties manning the counter were really funny when I asked them for recommendations. I can't reproduce our politically incorrect conversation but they were hilarious. Bottom line, Aussie Roll probably works for some and will last awhile because it serves the perfect market in Raffles Place.",

    "text": "Craving quick takeaway sushi you can eat at your desk? Bored of staring at sushi conveyor belts? Get a quick fix at Aussie Roll, \u00a0right in the heart of CBD. This review is going to be simple. \u00a0Aussie Roll has a great appeal. The queue is long during lunch peak hours but it moves really quickly. \u00a0The 3 or 4 service personnel there have a good system going. There's a huge variety of sushi to choose from. Its listed on a wall inside which you can stare at while waiting in line - \u00a0another great idea! A few of my select favourite include the king prawn variations and calamari sushi! All really tasty. Choosing a particular 'roll' \u00a0of sushi gets you 4 pieces each and my normal meal consists of 2 to 3 rolls on average. By all means have more if you can. Soy sauce and wasabi takeaway sachets are also available just right after you are done paying. Almost production line like, \u00a0but if it works it works! Did I mention how affordable it is? At $2.60 to $3.20 for each roll, \u00a0you would hardly ever spend more than $12 here. Which is great for that much sushi. They are not stingy either in terms of how packed each roll is. Apparently the rolls go at 2 for 1 after 6pm, so hey, \u00a0pop over for dinner too if you are in the area. A much recommended fuss free joint if you want some no frills sushi and if you aren't too particular about sushi in general. This gets my stamp of approval.",

    "text": "I'm kind of in between and 3 and 4 on this - I wish they put more veggies together with the meat, the balance isn't quite there. Also, the sushi rice is really just mashed together rice \"paste\" almost, kind of what you'd expect from machines/not very good rice. That being said, it's pretty cheap, so I guess I shouldn't complain so much.Good \"happy hour\" deals! M-F 6pm onwards, buy 2 rolls get 1 free! Woohoo :) Each roll is around $2.60-$2.80, and they cut it into 4 for you if you say yes to cutting.I had:1. Spicy soy chicken - ratio of meat to flavour was not quite there - a bit lacking in flavour given how chunky the meat was! Eaten with the sushi rice, it became a bit bland overall. Good meat though.2. Korean BBQ beef - pretty good! The second piece started tasting a little salty though.. Which made me actually eat the rice to balance it out. Nice that there was a bit of lettuce and some cucumber to add crunch3. Korean spicy pork - I think this was my favourite! At first I liked the beef, then on my second piece (I ate 2 pcs of each roll) that started getting a bit too salty. So this one had the best balance of flavours. Wasn't that spicy to me, but I have pretty high tolerance for spice.They also have your more normal rolls like cream cheese salmon, salmon avocado, seaweed salad (for vegetarians), deep-fried sweet potato, lobster salad (pity there weren't any left!) and all types of breaded seafood (I was trying to steer clear of deep fried stuff).",
