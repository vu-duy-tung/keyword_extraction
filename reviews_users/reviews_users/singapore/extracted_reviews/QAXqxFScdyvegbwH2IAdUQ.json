    "text": "Good quality Korean BBQ AYCE buffet.I am typically not a big fan of AYCE buffets as I find the quality typically below par and since I have little self control when it comes to buffets, I tend to overeat, feeling guilty afterwards since it is not worth the calories (hey, don't judge me, I bet you do as well).However, I'm Kim has a good variety of meats, most of which we tried and approved of - especially the beef selection is large and better than your average buffet (try the galbi ribs). In addition, they have a decent choice of cooked sides, soups and other banchan.The only downside I can think of is that the grill is on the smallish side for the table but that helps you stop overeating so actually it is almost a plus. Also, in contrast with most kbbq's the staff is quite prompt in clearing the table so you always have sufficient space.The fact that it was completely packed on Saturday evening and had a line in front (which we could easily cut since we called up front for reservations) shows that I am not the only one who likes this place! Planning to go back!",

This place can get super crowded and the tables are placed too close together. It tends to run into other people and may not have much room to work with if you have a large group.",

    "text": "Came here twice already (lunch and dinner) and both times we ate ourselves silly. Lunch is cheaper but also had fewer choices in the meat/seafood dept. There were no prawns, galbi ribs, nor \"volcano chicken\" during lunch but was available during dinner. Ingredients were fresh and abundant. Galbi ribs were perfect. Also has a large offering of hot foods like mandus, french fries, soup, noodles, rice, etc.I like how the price is all inclusive including unlimited non-alcoholic drinks. Excellent service in keeping your table and grill clean. Be warned, at dinner we were given a 1.5 hour seating time limit. Sufficient for us, but may not be for others.",

    "text": "After watching streams of people queue up for I'm Kim Korean BBQ for years at SOTA. I finally decided to give it a try. It's main target audience are youngsters or students who want some korean bbq at a reasonable price. The prices range from $19.90++ to $24.90++ for weekend lunches. Check out therir facebook page as they randomly have facebook promotions just like the one they had on the day I visited, at just $19.90++ per pax for a group of 6 and more!They have a rather huge dining area, that can fit pretty much any party size. The minute you walk in, you will realize the drinks are on the right, cooked food is displayed against the wall at the back of the restaurant and all the tables are in a horizontal layout, parallel to the main street. You will also notice that it doesn't have a strong bbq smell, that most girls are afraid of smelling like, after the meal! Do not fret as they have vents to suck up the BBQ smells, there's even ocsilating fans to keep the air fresh.At the cooked food station, there's some sushi, soup, korean pancakes, noodles and steamed rice. I highly recommend trying their fried chicken wings.They are HUGE! Not to mention, these chicken wings put 4 Fingers to shame! The skin is so crispy, the meat is tender and the sauce has a tangy sweetness to it.Pick your vegetables and seafood too! The prawns were fresh looking and rather sizeable. The variety of vegetables should be sufficient for most. They were replenished frequently too! Lots of vegetables to go along with the meat. Lettuce is fresh and crazily crunchy and it is a MUST HAVE for me at Korean BBQs because I always use them to wrap up my meat.Moving onto the actual bbq, the bbq surface area was decent enough for 4, you could separate your meats, ie (beef, non-beef or spicy and non-spicy) The hot plate itself got hot pretty quickly and you can control the temperature on the side of the hot plate.I would usually cook the beef atop the vegetables, such as onion or mushroom, so that the vegetables would absorb all the juices from the meat and at the same time, the meat would be good in a reasonable amount of time.After cooking, the meats were tender and juicy. Definitely better than I had expected. Grab a plate or two and stack them up with meats and also get ready to stack up another plate of cooked food! Also, to my pleasant surprise, the staff were extremely friendly and taught us how to cook and eat the meats with the vegetables. I had no problems getting the staff attention whenever I needed help or assistance.They had a varienty of meats, such as marinated ribeye, beef roll, pork belly, chicken and for those who love spicy. Go for their volcano style seasoned meats, you will not be disappointed.Check out the colours of the beef and also the mountain of raw meats, eying for an empty spot on the BBQ hot plate! The Beef Rolls cook fast and I cut them up into even pieces. These fine slices of beef are delectable and easy to eat. They are savoury but not overwhelming, and make for the perfect start to my Korean BBQ feast.The bacon strips were my favourite. Probably the most unhealthy, but it was salty and juicy, overflowing with fatty goodness. The meat also so very soft and fresh. Bacon lovers will probably love the unlimited amounts of bacon available here.There's also free flow of non-alcholic drinks such as iced water, lime juice, mango juice, rice punch and korean barley tea. All the drinks tasted rather diluted to me but the sweetest drink for me which I liked was the rice punch. They also sell alcoholic drinks for those who want a complete Korean bbq meal!Conclusion : I'm Kim delivered great value meats and cooked food buffet with excellent staff service and atmosphere.Head here for a fuss free korean BBQ that is gentle on your wallet!",

    "text": "Been wanting to try this place for the longest time and finally made it here on a Saturday. Crowded but thanks to a friend who arrived early we got a table for 3 easily. the spread is not big but the quality is good especially in the meat section- pork belly, pork collar, and marinated galbi, garlic chicken were fresh and tasty. The spiciest volcano chicken was something to be reckon with! unless chilli padi is your best friend or that you enjoy the sensation of having a numb tongue and sausage lips, don't bother trying it out. the sides of Korean fried chicken, candied sweet potato, tteokbokki. japchae, chicken soup, seafood (namely shrimp/prawn), lettuce, drinks etc weren't too shabby as well. The only down side was that I was seated under the television and it was really loud. We were given only 90 mins for the buffet but it was more than enough to fill my belly... maybe guys will have a different opinion. Definitely will give it a 2nd try on a weekday for comparison.",

There's a variety of Korean dishes available and the juices were good. It was refreshing to hear some Korean music after weeks of music I didn't understand.

    "text": "An all you can eat Korean BBQ joint surrounded by Schools with plenty of students in the area. Feels like the places back home. There are a good variety of meats to choose from, pork loin belly, marinated beef, marinated short ribs... not bad, I liked the pork loin belly myself, but that's what I normally eat when I'm having bqq. The selection seems to be centered around the meats which isn't a bad thing. There is plenty of kimchee, lettuce wrap, picked dikon wrap, and garlic and peppers to litter your ssam.Definitely better than what I would expect at an all you can eat bbq joint and better than the BBQ buffets back home for sure. This place is more value and bang for the buck. Amongst bbq buffets I'd say 4 stars, but relative to other kbbq places 3 stars for quality of meats. Maybe because I can't eat as much as I used to during my younger days, but I don't value the quantity as much as I used to.",

    "text": "I'm torn between two and three stars, but I'm going with two because this restaurant is relatively famous. I've tried a few kbbq buffet places in random malls, and they are usually okay because when everything fails, one can eat chadol (thinly sliced beef brisket) with ssamjang and lettuce and be completely satisfied paying $24 since meat is so expensive in Singapore. Not this place. I'm Kim somehow managed to make ssamjang that's just wrong.There is a range of ssamjang flavors that can all be acceptable but the ssamjang here is not within that range. This affects everything you eat in kbbq because it's the basic sauce. In most kbbq places in Singapore, the meat is not of great quality (unlike Los Angeles where they somehow get good meat and low prices). Usually the chadol is edible because there is no marinate to screw up, and it wasn't a great cut to begin with. Kalbi on the other hand is always bad because they use the wrong ribs (kalbi is not just any rib) plus the marinate could be wrong. Everything else depends on the marinate, so I usually try it but don't count on it. Here, none of the meats work. The kalbi is surprisingly the least offensive.The vegetable options are bad. The kimchi and any seasoned namul have a strange seasoning. I do highly recommend the pickled daikon for pairing with meats that are overly marinated to tone it down. I would prefer a more tender green leaf lettuce than the romaine leaves they offered.There seemed to be a lot of side dishes but I felt like there wasn't much to eat. The japchae was the best side dish. It was strange to see samosas. Honeyed sweet potatoes are dessert not appetizer. I skipped the fries and mandu.I managed to feed myself but I won't be coming back. Service was fine. The guy came by to change the grill once.",
