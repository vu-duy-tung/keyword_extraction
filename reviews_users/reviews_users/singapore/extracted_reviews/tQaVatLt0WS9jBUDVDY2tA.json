    "text": "Tanjong Pagar Food Centre and Market closed down for the past year to undergo a total renovation. They just reopened at the start of 2014 and boy am I glad they're back. Perhaps b/c it's on familiar turf but TPFC is one of my favorite hawker centres in Singapore. They have a good variety of food and all the stalls I've tried have been great, while prices are reasonable.One of my favorite stalls before the renovation was Annie's Peanut Ice Kachang. I haven't seen them back post-reno but I hope they are just taking their time!This is the cleanest outdoor food centre and they even have this foreign concept where people are encouraged to return their own trays after their meal. Since moving to Singapore I've gotten so used to the habit of leaving a dirty table after a meal, I've committed this faux paus in different countries like Korea, Japan, Philippines where people give you a dirty stare for not looking after your mess. Oops.Worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood!",

At lunchtime however, the business men and women sweep in and finding a seat can be troublesome.Definitely one of my favorite hawker, even if it would be impossible for me to recommend a specific stall.",

    "text": "It's my go to weekend breakfast joint!My favorite stall is the wonton mee stall with the green plates and the perpetual line. \u00a0Everything is tasty but my favorite are the fried dumplings filled with shrimp and pork... They sell out by the evening, so you gotta go in the early side if you want to sample some of this goodness! \u00a0A meal will cost south of 5 SGD.Another favorite is the pandan leaf nasi lemak stall... One of my friends likes it so much that he buys 10 packets at a time and stores them in his fridge!PARTING THOUGHT: my only gripe is that it's hard to predict which stalls will be open on a given day, but if there's truly nothing appealing, there's always the fruit vendors downstairs with something perfectly ripe and ready to eat.",

    "text": "Love this place, a pretty down-to-earth, heartlands-type eating place in the middle of the CBD. For some reason it has a different vibe vis-a-vis Amoy and Lau Pa Sat although all three places are positioned as hawker centres.There's this nasi lemak stall operated by an old couple that has a huge following (you won't miss the queues). I love their sambal (which is really rich and spicy) and they actually deep fry their hard boiled eggs (which I've never seen at other nasi lemak joints). Best of all, they're super affordable - 1 egg, chicken wing, a helping of ikan bilis and a slide of luncheon meat costs you only 2.80.Next to the nasi lemak stall is also a pretty decent fish dumplings hor fun outlet that surprisingly enough doesn't really have queues. Like their herbal-tasting soup base that comes with the hor fun and they freshly fry their fish dumplings as well! I think they can do with more support from the Yelp community :)",

The best place of course to go here is Annie's Peanut Ice Kachang. Definitely go when it's open as you don't want to miss out on a Singaporean dessert treat!",

    "text": "Staying in Tanjong Pagar, I am spoilt for choices when comes to dining.Tanjong Pagar Food Centre has many yummy and worth mentioning famous stores such as the nasi lemak,peanut iced caching, char kway teow, \u00a0lor mee, yong tau foo and many more. This is a very popular hawker centre for the people in town to get relative cheap eats for lunch. \u00a0It can get very crowded and sometimes takeaway will be the best option. Well, the only downside is that the hawkers are used to serving the office crowds in Shenton Way that are usually closed on the weekends especially on sunday. \u00a0For residents staying in tanjong pagar unless we work in town, we hardly have opportunity \u00a0to try out the delightful foods that is almost near our doorsteps.",

    "text": "Tanjong Pagar Food Center and Market is a great place for lunch especially for the corporate crowd working around the area. Some of my favorite picks include the won ton noodles, herbal chicken soup, mixed veg rice and Thai food. I can't remember the specific names of these stores but they are located along the same row and you can often spot a long \u00a0queue for the Thai Food and Mixed Veg Rice. \u00a0The only setback to this place is the lack of ventilation so it can get pretty warm on hot afternoons.",
