    "text": "Now rebranded 'Treasures by Imperial Treasure' and redecorated, it serves the same HK-style comfort food as Crystal Jade Kitchen. The food is as reliable as the latter, but the menu is longer (for example, they still serve frog congee whereas CJK has eliminated that item). And surprisingly, it is even slightly cheaper than CJK in many places (like Holland Village), although the rent here is certainly higher.",

Fish congee/porridge is just very Ok, there's not much taste to it. The plate of BBQ pork rice roll looks unappetizing and again just very ok which was surprising since my two experiences with similar dish at Man Fu Yuan and Taste Paradise were both amazing. Service on the other hand was absolutely great. The ladies, from the servers to the cashier who rang up my order, were all cheery and very nice.Without the service, I will give this place a 2 stars review. PS. Sorry no pictures this time, but you won't find me returning.",

If you are craving for HK's style porridge and wanton noodle, you may come.Minus one star for the overly cramped seating arrangement. I could hear conversations from people who were seated next to me. :/ I didn't want to eavesdrop honestly.",

    "text": "Be here early or get ready for a wait. It is a popular place for affordable Chinese food or dim sum in ION. If there is a line, go up to the maitre d and indicate the number of people in your party and you will be given a number, then wait for the number to be called (also flashed on the wall). The dim sum is pretty good - shrimp dumpling, fried carrot cake and liu sha bao (salted egg custard bun) are some of my favorites. The spicy and sour dumplings are equally yummy. The offerings are very similar to what you get in Crystal Jade Kitchen but the quality is much better here. The prawn paste chicken wing is also very good, likewise for the beef brisket noodles. The congee is very smooth and does not turn watery after a while. The 3 combination meat platter (char siew, duck and roast pork) is excellent with succulent char siew and duck. The roast pork has very crispy skin which crackled when you bit into it. Save some room for dessert, especially the sago with mango juice. The durian pudding is not bad too.",

    "text": "My 3rd visit so far. One of my go-to places for comfort food, HK style. Hidden in the bowels of B3 Ion. Shanghainese xiaolongbao soup dumplings My fav, even better than Din Tai Fung as the latter's quality is not there anymore. That's right, Imp Treasure has solid soup dumplings. Thin skin and flavorful juicy filling. Turnip cake aka carrot cakeFirst time I had it and was impressed by generous pieces of carrot in the savory cake. Can't wait to order again. Rice rolls with donut fritter filling Crepes were silky thin and the filling was nice and crunchy. A bit too much soy sauce tho. Wish they offered it on the side. Will ask next time. Noodles with shrimp roeFans of this Macanese dish, rejoice! I've had the Sardinian variety and today's version was yum. Chewy egg noodles and roe that taste of the sea. Will attempt to recreate at home. La mian: pork and shredded cabbage. Best eaten right away as the noodles can lose their texture in hot soupHitsSolid dishes as listed above. Aunties serving you, kinda feels like home in a wayMisses Ha gao shrimp dumplings - too mushy411Go because it's good food for decent prices. Another go to of mine. Their daily Signature HK style soups are solid as well.",

    "text": "Ate a lot here - it's a cheaper option than the steamboat version that's on the 4th floor and the peking duck version at Paragon.The style is a lot like Crystal Jade Kitchen - though it's slightly more expensive and has more options, but you'd really not be able to tell if you're in Crystal Jade Kitchen or Imperial Treasure. I got abalone noodles which was a little too salty and probably wouldn't order it again.Peking duck was $55 and really quite good. I like that they didn't leave much fat and it was purely skin - nice and crispy. The pancake tasted good too. They were stingy on the veggies and if you want an extra plate, it costs $2.Jellyfish - as a starter... this dish was okay, nothing remarkable.Dessert - got almond cream with tang yuan. The tang yuan was not bad but the almond cream tasted quite processed.In total our meals including vegetables, another plate of noodles and fish congee came up to $170 (for 3 people). Oh one more special mention - I loved the homemade iced lemon tea! Delicious.",

It will always come to my mind if I want to have some decent Chinese food.Prices at the restaurant are affordable and they offer Cantonese dishes like dim sum and normal dishes to go along with rice. The service crew are able to speak in cantonese which may favor the elderly who prefer to speak in that language. It may be quite crowded during dining hours but waiting and serving time are short and efficient.I have been there for quite a number of time for dinner and the stew chicken with yam is always a must on the table.",

This being a noodle house, I got myself the pork fore shank noodles, roast pork and fibre in the form of spinach with assorted egg. Pork fore shank, or \"ju shao\" in Cantonese, literally meaning pig hand, was tender. Not much meat, though the pork skin was all collagen-y goodness. Noodles were al dente and very thin, though I thought it could have been springier. Roast pork was ok, though $9 for 9 squares is a tad pricy. Spinach was yummy, though nothing out of the ordinary. Total bill, with tea came up to under $40. It's not exactly cheap, and combined with the long queues, I'm not sure if I'd come back again.",
