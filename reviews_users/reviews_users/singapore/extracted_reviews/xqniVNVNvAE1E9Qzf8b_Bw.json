The order queue is so long, it will definitely intersect with the drinks queue at some point, creating a confusing mess. Found it very frustrating, and decided to do a takeaway of lemon zest tart and berry crumble. Both items were at $6 each, which was a little eh? as the tart is smaller than one's palm, and the crumble was easily twice the size of the tart. Tart was well.. not tart, which left me a little disappointed. It was actually rather sweet, given the candied lemon zest. Tart shell was firm to the bite, and made a mess when it shattered all over my desk. I quite liked the berry crumble - now that was tart and sweet all at once. The base was buttery, the crumbled top crunchy, and the whole item summery and yummy.",

    "text": "There is alot of hype surrounding Tiong Bahru Bakery, it's gotten alot of press ever since it opened so I wanted to see if it lived up to all the glowing reviews.Quite easy to miss if you walk a little too fast along Eng Hoon St, the bakery's got quite a welcoming interior as a long row of pastries greet you as you enter.I tried the supposedly \"best croissant in Singapore\" with a cup of flat white. There is free flow of butter and jam and water on a separate counter which I loved. The croissant was still delicately crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside, it was good yes! But then how much better can the plain dough of croissant get? Not to dismiss the skill behind baking a really quality croissant but surely there's more to this bakery than the croissants!So I had the salmon sandwich which came with a cardamom bread. All the sandwiches have been pre-made so you can't really choose whether you want salmon with the squid ink bread or chicken with the cardamom bread, which is quite a bummer because I wanted to try the squid ink bread with the salmon. I didn't really enjoy the cardamom bread because the cardamom seeds kept getting stuck in my teeth.It was very crowded for a weekday and the queue was busy throughout!Final verdict: I dough not know if it will continue to reinvent itself or get too complacent with its current success but for now I'll just come for takeaways because it gets way too crowded.",

Taste-wise, the baguette's near-perfect, down to the hard, flaky brown skin, and the moist, chewy 'flesh' that has the texture and bite comparable to the boulangerie in Rue Caulaincourt in Paris (loved it!). Price-wise, at 65 cm (the benchmark), the one in Singapore comes up to S$2.80, while a Parisian counterpart would be \u20ac0.80 (about S$1.50). A little too overpriced (especially the croissants!), but lending the Gontran Cherrier baking touch comes with a price (I guess). Will definitely be back for the basic breads, but will give the sandwiches, savoury items and coffee a miss as there's no way I'm paying S$8.00 for a sandwich the size of my palm.",

    "text": "I must say that Tiong Bahru Bakery is quite a cheeky cafe, this. From the outside you may easily walk past, disregarding it as one of them shophouses, especially with the chinese teal stamp on the wall outside. Yet on the inside it was as though past met present - its choice of furniture created a feel of a 70s bakery, yet it also had all the luxuries of a present day air-conditioned cafe. If anything, it can get pretty congested when fully seated, and so rather noisy - but I guess that just adds to the buzz and bustle of it all.I asked the lady at the counter (as I always do) for their recommendation, and was a little surprised when she pointed me to their simplest of plain croissants. It did seem quite pricey ($2.50), but I thought that if she'd dare to point me to something as plain as that, there must be something to it, so on I went to get that, and just that. It was such a treat! You could help yourself to as much butter and jam as you wanted from the side, and trust me you'll want more than one little dish of it. The prune/plum jam was such a good balance of sweet and a little sour and a tinge of bitter, which made my croissant taste like a good after meal sweetener. Then if you'd add the butter you feel like it could well be a pre-meal bite. Such versatile tastes based on the freshest, crisp and perfectly baked croissants you'll find in this country! I found it to be $2.50 well spent.",

    "text": "Come for the kouign amann and buzzy atmosphere. Spotted before: Zoe TayThe weekend that Tiong Bahru Bakery first opened, traffic snarled to a stop on Eng Hoon Street. Despite new outdoor seating, the best place to sit is indoors, close by the long display of breads and pastries, sandwiches, and baked desserts (in that order). If you're just ordering the fabulous 40 Hands coffee, skip the (usually long) queue and go straight to the counter, one for cash payments and the other for credit cards. Tiong Bahru neighbours swear by the kouign amann ($3.50), a salted caramel spiral-shaped 'croissant' which offers crisp layers and layers of buttery, sticky delight. There is no fruit filling (if you like those, Pullman Bakery does a decent version). There are three croissants - plain ($2.50), almond and chocolate. The texture of the plain croissant isn't the classic flaky sort; here it has many distinct layers - not a unanimous favourite. The almond paste version is much too sweet for me, while the chocolate has a really good quality to it. Baked desserts are rather pricey for the size, but seem to be popular. Try the palm-sized lemon tart ($6), which is sweet and zingy with a lovely short crust. Sandwiches are a good deal, with various ingredients such as bacon, avocado and tuna, each matched to a specific bread such as squid ink or sunflower seeds. (And makes for a cheaper lunch than at sister establishment 40 Hands on the other side of Tiong Bahru). From the recreated old skool look to the freshly baked and high quality goods, this place deserves all its kudos - but the slightly high price point keeps it from becoming a true daily hangout.",

    "text": "Recently tried their new savoury croissants.Speaking of the \"Rolling Dumpling\", I would not have guess that it was inspired from Xiao Long Bao if not for the menu description as it lacked the distinctive traits of this classic chinese dumpling such as the slurpy pork broth. Yes, there were pickled ginger and succulent minced meat but the black vinegar dressing could not lift up the dish.Nonetheless, the sparkling chemistry between the subtly spiced chorizos and the sweet caramelized onion jam in the \"Flying Pig\" left me clamouring for more. Its miso dressing did not overpower the dish and I wouldn't even mind if the sausage was spammed with even more of the tasty onion relish on top. As a person with a soft spot for fish, I thought I would love the \"Jumping Fish\" the most but it turned out otherwise. A bite into this voluptuous croissant revealed an oasis of minced spinach and salmon filling. The smoked salmon was not too salty but the filling, which reminded me of the classic Greek Pie Spanakopita, needed a shake of herbs to bring it to life. Another calorie-worthy croissant is the \"Running Egg\" that was garnished with non-heady Japanese spicy flakes. While ramen egg gurus might insist that the \"molten\" egg yolk could be more gooey, I thought the current consistency worked well with the bonito flakes and mayonnaise sauce, which contributed to the tasty umami flavours.Prepared fresh in batches and kept warm in hotboxes to retain the temperature, all the croissants, except for the Ramen egg, are baked together with the ingredients. This results in a croissant dough that are more moist and chewy while the external layer retains a delightful crunch.Each croissant is retailing at $4.50 each or you can select any two flavours to go with the tangy salad with yuzu dressing, dried cranberry and mixed seeds for $12. My suggestion is to enjoy these savoury croissants at the outlets where they are served piping hot and fresh from the oven. It's alright if your stomach acknowledged the aroma of caramelized butter by making some embarrassing growls in public.Mine did but so did everyone.",

I had this infusion of butter in my blood kinda feeling after my breakfast. (if you know what I mean). The chocolate croissant has a really thin layer of chocolate in appearance, but the taste of chocolate was really strong! pretty delighted with that!Pandan, to me it's a very localized flavour, and I like the idea of it! It gave croissant a different punch in fragrance, worth a try!Kouign Aman was my companion's favourite, as it's salted caramel flavoured! (bread infused with salted butter and caramelized sugar!) Overall taste of the breads were really good!Had a latte and received a fantastic latte art. The sight of it makes me love the cup of latte I was holding on to. Taste awesome!The bad side: over priced. Totally over priced.Even the coffee is over priced.My first bite into the cold breads in the morning was a huge disappointment. I was expecting the bread to be at least warm. All my 3 breads that I ordered were served cold. :(All in all, it was only A-OK for me. too much a hype.=/",

    "text": "The Pastry: I had the Kouign Aman. Think of a light croissant - crispy, buttery layers topped with salt and caramel. More tasty than their plain croissant and not too sweet, which I liked. They also provided an assortment of fruity jams at the side (self-service). I picked a dark, pump colored one which I suspected was a mixture of fig and blueberries.  The Sandwich: KH had \"The Speciality Bun with Bacon\" and not being a big fan of bacon, I only took a small bite out of it. It consisted of bacon as its name suggests, onions, rocket salad and sun-dried tomatoes. The bacon strip was neither deep fried nor salty but still tasted good. A much healthier way of consuming bacon has been invented (hurray!). The bun was really soft and not heated. Personally, I prefer my carbs hot and crusty but this was ok too. The Beverage:The coffee was divine (probably the best part of my meal). I had a simple latte. Later, I learnt that the coffee was provided by Forty Hands (also part of the Food Collective owned by Spa Esprit Group.) Fun Fact: This is the same group behind the concept of House @Dempsey and Skinny Pizza, both of which I enjoy. Definitely looking forward to checking out their other food joints that I haven't tried, like Open Door Policy \u00a0and Forty Hands. Overall: 3.5/5 (but I can't seem to do a 0.5 on Yelp. oh wellz... 4 then :))Overall, I think it's a pretty decent place for an afternoon tea or a light snack if you are around the area (Tiong Bahru can be pretty far and there's not much to do around there except eat *again* at other places, which we almost did at Rachel's outrageous suggestion if our bellies weren't at the brink of exploding).Pictures of the cafe and its food can be found on my website, pandarcakes :)",

I am amazed at the amount of people who chill here around 10 AM on weekdays, both locals and expats. I almost want to yell, \"Does anyone do any work around here?!\"*There's a lot of baked goods to choose from, but I normally aim to satisfy my sweet tooth by ordering their chocolate croissants. Their plain croissants are also worth a try, as they're super soft, flaky, and buttery. There's also a savoury that I love, but it has a French name that I can't remember... all I know is that it smells like pizza and it's delicious!I'm not sure if they do this all the time, but the coffee that they offer is from Forty Hands (as they're related.) So if you're a fan of the brand, you can easily get your fix here.The only criticism I have is that the furniture is starting to show some wear and tear. If they could just repurpose the chairs and tables, perhaps it will give it a less tired look.*You know I would never do such a thing. I'm obviously just jealous!",

Talk about simple pleasures.This is definitely THE bakery of the moment, so it gets pretty crowded, even on weekdays. Worth a visit, and make sure you get one of their baguettes to enjoy back at home as well.",

OMG tarts, and croissants, and savouries too, with coffee and tea, in a pleasant great smelling and great looking French bakery that's quickly gaining popularity judging from the waitlist of people trying to get in. This must be what heaven is like, and French heaven is just extra sexy.These were the first thoughts running through my head when I first saw Tiong Bahru Bakery in the first week of its opening. Tiong Bahru is really getting its hip on, there was no doubt.I had Kouign aman -- if a croissant and a salted butter sultana got together and had a baby, this would be it. It was buttery and only slightly sweet, and so fluffy, I could taste a hint of salt (and a bit of heaven), life was good there and then. To be kind to my waistline, I'm going to make it a point to try something new every week here, instead of doing it all at once, and because I just want an excuse to come back all the time.Coffee was nothing to write about, but hey, that's not what Gontran Cherrier is famous for.",

Serving up a range of pastries and desserts that are all freshly baked to perfection according to the chef's recipes, the number one selling item here is the plain croissant. While it sounds too basic to be a best seller, the flaky and crispy exterior has a soft airy interior that will blow your mind away. Othermust-tries include the Kouign Aman and chocolate brioche.

Unfortunately, the both Pandan Flan didn't impress - most of their baked goods are priced above $6 and I was just hoping for that little bit more. It's a beautiful space with such a vibrant atmosphere; I'd be happy to come back and give TBB another go! Apparently - the croissants are legendary!",

    "text": "Like that ex you can never cut ties with, I have a love hate relationship with Tiong Bahru Bakery.Let's get this clear. Tiong Bahru Bakery is expensive. Whether you think it's worth it is of course, up to you, but I generally don't think it is.The sandwiches are good, but cost more than two plates of chicken rice at the market down the street... and isn't more filling. What's worth going for? The Kouign-amann. Buttery caramel-y goodness, this is absolutely delicious and the one thing I go back for again and again despite my verbal insistence that I actually boycott the place. After a few weeks of having it regularly though, I'm proud to say that I'm finally so-over it and managed to stay away for a good 3 months.That all came crashing to an end today after I popped in for a coffee. If you didn't know, TBB is owned by the same company that owns Forty Hands, meaning you know you're going to get a good cup of coffee here. It's a little pricey, for a 'small' cappuccino, meaning that coffee here is actually a touch more expensive that most places in the CBD. But it's good, robust coffee, and if you're already overpaying for bread and pastries, well you might as well overpay for drinks too right?Why is it still receiving 3 stars then? Why do I go back? Because it's across the street from my office, and it has the best coffee in the area. Because the quality of what it offers is undeniable, they do good shizz. But the prices. Oh the prices.",

I must say, I had high expectations seeing as to how my friends have raved about this place. Verdict? NahhhhThe salmon wasn't fresh, very unlike the salmon baguette I had at Broers Cafe (and their specialty isn't sandwiches!). And they could've been a bit more generous with the cream cheese. The pear tart was okay (with the so-so hand action). Could've been sweeter, given how the girl asked me \"would you like any sweets to go with your meal?\". Coffee was okay too.I guess it could be because it's 6pm and the food isn't quite as fresh. I'll give it a second chance and be sure to be here much earlier in the day. So far, seems pretty overrated.",

Other dessert items are so-so.One comment is the quality is a bit inconsistent across branches - the best one is at the original Tiong Bahru branch.

Their flaky outside somehow holds a thick, kind of gooey, but not cloying, center, outlined in good rich dark chocolate. The paper bag is hefty in your hand when you carry it out - felt like a good pound.",

    "text": "This was one of my top places I wanted to check out while I was in Singapore. I thought that Tiong Bahru Bakery was good but not great. The options are fairly limited and because their items are pre-made and I was told there are no chefs behind the kitchen during working hours, then they don't do any substitutions or adjust menu items. For example, they sell croissants and have boiled eggs in another menu item but they couldn't sell it to me together. I had ordered the Quiche Lorraine, Croissant, and Apple Kouign Amann to share with my mom. The croissant was okay, nothing really special. The Kouign Amani and quiche were fantastic! Very flavorful! I also felt in comparison to all of the other places in Singapore the service was lacking. The waitress was not very attentive. She would forget things or ignore us and the tables next to us. Regardless of those details, the Kouign Amann and Quiche earned the four stars.",

    "text": "Definitely a popular spot for people to hangout. I found it a little expensive for certain items and their pastry selection was good. Croissants are kind of flaky. And apple kouign amann was a little too sweet but a good consistency and taste. I'd say the atmosphere was quaint and pleasant. The people working seemed nice although there was a customer in front of me and that was unsure of what to order and the server kind of seemed annoyed. The bakery was okay but if I wasn't in the area, I don't think I'd travel just to go there. Tip 1: go earlier to have more selection. Tip 2: if you're unsure of what to get, many people try their almond croissant and their coffee",

In the weekday's mornings, thankfully, it is not as packed but it is still buzzing. I wonder why people do not have to work and hang out at coffeeshop all the time. The bakery is good, though I chance upon quite a disappointing macha croissant today. Just order the original croissant will do. The kouign amann is also good, but a lil too sweet. Overall, I like this joint better than the one at City Hall as it is more quaint because it is located within the hip Tiong Bahru neighbourhood.",

My clear favorite is their Almond Croissant. It is a bit different than most other croissants as it is bigger, heavier and has a slightly more dense feel to it. The generous filling of almond does however make it really nice. Most of the other pasties I have tried have also been very good as well as some of the savory croissants as well. They do also sell 'regular' bread but actually never tried any of it but it does look nice.They serve pretty good coffee as well (from 40 hands) and the teas are also nice. I also like that they manage to keep things moving smoothly despite the place being full and the service is with a smile.",

This is both the upside and downside of this local bakery - the constant line and flow of people means they are always putting out fresh goodies and pastries and even the displayed cakes aren't laying around for long. On the downside, it is rather difficult to find a place to sit especially on the weekends and lunch time. With that said, Tiong Bahru bakery is worth a visit as they have many original pastries, cakes and even savory treats, including one of my favorites the squid ink bun. When I lived in Tiong Bahru and even now, it is one of my favorite breakfast cafes.",

It was difficult to cut so we had to resort to using our hands, but it was heaven in every mouthful. The sweetness was just right. The vanilla cream just melts in your mouth and the the biscuity puffs sandwiching it were a perfect complement. My latte was alright - have had better coffee elsewhere. Ambiance is so-so. Would be nicer if the staff made sure all the tabletops were clean after customers leave. But if you're just grabbing and going, nothing to concern you about. I also bought some kouign amanns to go.
