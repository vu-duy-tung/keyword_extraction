    "text": "Upscale Italian place on Club Street. The food is consistently good across the board but not spectacular. Specific details based on our order below:- Bread basket - ok / standard good. What you would expect from this type of restaurant- Burrata - Ok - good quality of burrata cheese though I definitely have had better -creamier, fresher than this one elsewhere in Singapore. The accompanying parma ham and veggie are good though- Shrimp starter - good but nothing outstanding - high quality shrimp - grilled well - served on an eggplant puree with zucchini- 1M Pappardelle with Ragu - one of their signature dishes. Ok. The pasta is al dente and the meter long is appetizing. However, the Ragu is lacking / underwhelming and the sauce does not fully come together with the pasta- Spaghetti with lobster in tomato sauce - also ok. The dish is very tomato-y. While the tomato is fresh and tasty, it overpowered the entire dish. I wish there was a better balance with the diff ingredients- Seabass - cooked very well. Perfectly crispy skin and the right texture on the fish. - Tiramisu - ok / standard goodService is a mixed bag - some ppl are nicer / more attentive than others.",

    "text": "I was taken here on a Saturday night, and we didn't sit in the open-air courtyard, but instead in the ACed interior, which was tastefully decorated. We were seated at a round table which was a bit awkward for two people. The friendly Sicilian sommelier recommended a great white for us to go with our meal. For starters, we got the prawns and the burrata, which was a bit of a happy mistake for me. The burrata came with 8 slices of ham, rocket, and cherry tomatoes while my companion only got 2 prawns! Needless to say I needed some help to finish my burrata. Perhaps it should have been shared between 2 people. The prawns were large and crunchy, very delicious, while the burrata was good, but not as soft as I'd like. My companion was very hungry and suggested we share a pasta, the Pappardelle Xxlong, with wild boar ragout. I wasn't too sure about the choice, but it sounded fun - a meter-long pappardelle... sure. They had split the portion for us to share, so I had a 0.5m long pappardelle instead. I wasn't expecting it, but I was completely blown away when I bit into the pasta. It was perfectly cooked, with enough bite, and not at all mushy, with just the right thickness. The ragout was good and the boar/pork was soft, but I could have eaten the pasta in any other sauce and finished it. I would definitely come back just for this dish. We both got the lamb rack each for our mains, and it came with carrot pur\u00e9e and a rosemary garlic crumble which I really enjoyed. The lamb was cooked exactly the way I wanted - medium rare. What I found strange about this main, was that my companion's lamb had 4 ribs in total, while mine had 6! I swapped out 3 ribs for 2, so we would have an equal amount of meat. It was funny how the entire night I kept having a gargantuan portion relative to my companion's. I finished the meal with the chocolate explosion, which the waitstaff kindly handed me the dessert menu before I finished my main. The chocolate explosion required 15 mins wait, which was good timing. It turned out to be a chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and berries. The interior of the lava cake was flowy and molten. Absolutely delicious with the ice cream, which presumably was of decent quality, with no pesky ice crystals' crunching.Would I return? Yes! And have the pappardelle all to myself.",

Yet, prices are at the same level as the best in town. Service is competent, but old-fashioned and not pro-active. Sure, the patio is nice and the ambience pleasant, but I'd rather have the better food at Braci, Osteria Arte, Garibaldi, etc.",

Set in a conservation shophouse, the front houses a bar where you can have drinks and there is a good wine list. In the heart is a courtyard for alfresco dining but for our party we had the private dining space in air conditioned comfort. Service here is excellent and the food as expected to be delicious. I chose scallops for my starter which was fantastic and the lamb rack which was beautifully done to mediumness. While I've had better panna cotta elsewhere, it was still good here and as it was my birthday, the restaurant arranged a special treat of their \u00a0tiramisu.",

My tagliatelle was so perfect it got kind of bland. That sounds bad. What I mean is, because of the price and environment, your expectations are hitting a whole new level and I'm not sure Senso reaches them. I think that's what the other reviewers are getting at. If you want a wonderfully executed modern Italian lunch, then by all means come here. If you're iffy about spending $40 on it, I can't promise you'll feel like it was worth it.",

The buffet spread is decent with some high points (chilled shrimp, different cheeses and nice little shot glasses of soup) and a few misses (no omelette bar and not such a great selection of oysters), but the made-to-order small plate menu earns the fifth star. You will be hard pressed to find a better deal in Singapore for the price. You can dine inside, which has chilly AC or al fresco in the courtyard. Senso also takes part in the entertainer program.",
