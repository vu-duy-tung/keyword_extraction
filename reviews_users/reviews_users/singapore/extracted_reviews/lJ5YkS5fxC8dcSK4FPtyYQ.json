Had a nicer experience at the same place last Oct 2014. Last night ordered 3 dishes comprising a small white pepper crab (not enough pepper), small steamed fish (bland and meat a bit tough); and large $20 hor fun ( that came with 3 small prawns, some slices of toman fish, chye sin and few slices of chicken - no egg). Not sure if the standard of food is better at the other branches. Generally, the quantity & quality of food is not worth the prices charged.",

This is the only one of the No Signboard Seafood's I'll visit, ambience of sitting street side in geylang, adds to that charm that only fellow expats would understand and relate too. \u00a0The outdoor dining area is gritty and dirty, with cheap plastic chairs and wonky tables with large fans providing some airflow under the large canvas awning. \u00a0A trip to the bathroom will have you carefully stepping over the piping and puddles leading into the live seafood tanks, where they have everything from seabss, crabs, lobsters, frogs, prawns and many more. The chili and black pepper crab here is very good. One of the places I'll frequent when I'm craving one of the two. Would recommend this place particularly to anyone who wants to give overseas guest a uniquely Singaporean seafood experience.",

    "text": "No Signboard - A place loved by its patrons so much they gave it a name.Before I get into this too much I have to say I had never had Singapore Chilli Crab until this night. I know about the other alternatives and do plan to test them out but for now it was No Signboard.I found this seafood restaurant very accessible via public transport (get off on the Aljunied stop on the Green East West MRT line and its a short walk from there). Me and some work mates thought we would get our Chilli Crab on and swanned down here after work the other day.Rocking up around 7pm, there was still a few spare tables so we didn't have to wait - bonus! Chilli crab was always going to be on our menu so that was a given. We also had the Drunken Bull Frog and Sambai Kang Kong.With 4 beers on offer (Guiness, Tiger, Heineken and Carlsberg) we opted for the Tiger which goes for $8 for the bigger bottles. The crab is priced at $60 a kilo and then you just decide which way you want it cooked and go from there. We generally went for around half a kilo of crab each because we were trying other options from the menu.The Chilli Crab? AMAZING! Then again it is my only benchmark, but for now I am thoroughly impressed. The Drunken Bull Frog was a close second for me but maybe that is because I miss frog (we don't really have that in Australia).Its all very out in the open and as other people have said, I would probably avoid this place on a really hot and steamy day. But as it was the other night (a bit cooler) I found it quite pleasant. Bring napkins or wet wipes too as they don't provide them free of charge. Chilli crab can get quite messy so bear this in mind when deciding what to wear there as well! All in all I walked away thoroughly impressed and plan to return in future to sample the White Pepper Crab which I hear is something of a specialty here also.",

Referring to the Chili Crab - the reason why I came here. \u00a0Reviews seemed OK, an Australian friend recommended it - but I did see some reviews about quality and taste being down from its glory days. \u00a0Th Uber driver taking me there also implied it is not the same since the original chef moved on. But I had to see and judge for myself. \u00a0Now I know. \u00a0I specifically asked for SPICY chili crab and what I got was a tasteless dish with hardly any flavor or character to it. \u00a0Did not even finish it - eating for the sake of eating with no joy is pointless. \u00a0It is not cheap - my total bill was S$110 of which $65 was for chili crab. \u00a0It was wasted money and it hurts a bit since it was not even average. \u00a0What burns you more is that there is a nominal but silly charge for plain water in plastic cup and a towel to clean ur hands - mind you, we are talking crabs here. My advise, try some other restaurants known for their chili crab and avoid this - at least for now.",

    "text": "The quest for all things delicious in Singapore continued during my family's recent visit. \u00a0My aunt took one of those brochures for tourists at Changi and chili crab was named one of the top 10 must-try's and off we head to Geylang for our chilli crab as I have been told that No Signboard serves the best chilli crab in town. \u00a0To be honest I didn't have much expectations because 1. I am not a fan of chilli crabs I prefer black pepper crab; 2. I tried No Signboard in Hong Kong a few years ago and it was grossly overpriced with small portions; 3. \u00a0prior experiences with other famous and tourists oriented joints like Long Beach and Jumbo left the same impression that these famous crab places are rip-offs. \u00a0I am so wrong! \u00a0The chilli crab is amazing! and I don't even like chilli crab in the first place. \u00a0We ended up ordering extra servings of the little fried buns so we can scoop up the very last drop of sauce. \u00a0The other chilli crabs I have tasted so far all just tasted like spicy ketchup to me but the No Signboard version is different - just the right blend of spicyness and sweetness. \u00a0Oh and we ordered the white pepper crab since I have only had the black pepper version before and it is also yummy! \u00a0And oh the size of the crab, which is important, we ordered the smallest sized crab and the meat is very fresh and dense.We also had the stir fried sotong with pepper and chilli, a baby kailan, half an butter chicken and a bitter gourd soup. \u00a0The price is not cheap but hey, compared with all the other crab places around town I found it very reasonable. \u00a0It comes down to about SGD50 each for the 4 of us and we are stuffed to the brim. \u00a0Last time we spent about the same at Jumbo and had to order McDonalds later in the night. \u00a0So farewell Jumbo and Long Beach. \u00a0The outdoor seatings are spacious and comfortable and I think it's a great place to take visitors to since you can take a stroll around Geylang before or after dinner. This is probably the one non-sterile place in Singapore and shows that this place offers more than just glass and steel buildings or HDB blocks. \u00a0We also had durian a bit further down Geylang road - a very sweet ending to our night out in Geylang.",

We asked to be seated elsewhere, but they told us there were no other tables available (even when people left they wouldn't move us). \u00a0And there were some creepy men and prostitutes who kept eyeing us when they walked by. \u00a0Otherwise, it's a very lively place!Food: \u00a0We didn't order chili crab because we just had it the other day, but it looked quite delicious when the table next to us got it! \u00a0But the sauce looked pretty soupy. \u00a0In any case, we got razor clams, which were SOOOOO fresh, and the king prawns were deliciously juicy (until I took a bite of my last one, which was super dry). \u00a0I do think they had some consistency problems within some of the dishes. \u00a0Aside from the king prawns, the claypot tofu had shrimp also, but one of them tasted old and fishy while another had a fresh taste to it... \u00a0And def don't order the deer. \u00a0When it was good, the food was delicious, but when it's bad, it's so bad you have to spit it out.",

    "text": "I had a great first time experience here, due to a variety of factors:1) It had just rained earlier in the day, and when we arrived (late afternoon) the weather was PERFECT for al fresco dining. 2) My husband and I came here really early on Saturday (5 PM) so there was no wait and the staff was very attentive.3) I only ate a cheese stick, some cashews, and a small strawberry cake throughout the day, so by the time I arrived I was ready to chow down on some REAL food!As much as I really wanted to try the chili crab, a few friends + Yelp mentioned that it was a lot spicier than Jumbo's. My husband can't handle too much spice, and it was just the two of us, so we chose the next most talked about dish- white pepper crab! We also ordered drunken shrimp and fried rice. The drunken shrimp was served to us in big bowls filled to the brim with soup, and I enjoyed it very much. The fried rice, however, was probably the best fried rice I've ever tasted in my life. There was a little bit of everything in there, and it was absolutely divine. We also loved how they served it as our first dish, as we prefer to eat the rice with our crab. As for our white pepper crab, it didn't disappoint! It was served with a really flavorful sauce and some veggies that complimented the crab perfectly. It wasn't spicy, but at the same time it had taste, which made both me and my husband happy campers!No bibs were given to us (were we supposed to ask for them?), but they did have small IKEA laundry baskets at each table where you can keep your purse and any outerwear that you don't want to stain. Make sure to bring tissues if one wet nap isn't enough for you! Also, they do have a VIP section, which I presume means air conditioning. Not sure if there's anything special you need to do to get in, or if the prices are different!Speaking of prices, I did find it a bit pricey, as the bill for the two of us was $115 (however, this did include 1 large Tiger beer that we split and a dessert as well.) They do accept credit cards, though.Bottom line, I am a newly converted fan, and one of these days I will return and try the chili crab once and for all! Maybe I'll also bring a bottle of wine with me, as the corkage fee is only $10. Wanna come with? :)",

It is also under-seasoned and could do with more garlic.Cereal prawns and baby squids - both decent but again better versions elsewhere.Yang Zhou fried rice - beautifully fried.Chilli crab - I am definitely a bigger fan if pepper crab. But I was bringing visitors tonight and decided to go with our national dish. The dish is enjoyable and we went with the male crab (firmer flesh vs female crab with roe. Yes, sometimes, life is full of tough choices). Again, not the best out there. I kind of prefer long beach or jumbo.Add a vegetable and 4 large bottles of tiger beer, the bill came out to $200.What I like about the place is actually the location. Located in the colorful part of Singapore, you sit by Geylang road in the open and feel that this is how Singapore feels 20 years ago.",

I was so gutted on our first experience when our crab was deconstructed by the waiter at the table (I had visions of bibs and crabby faces... granted, our Singaporean host thought we would prefer it the clean way). The grittiness of Geylang teemed with friendly service, amazing flavours, reasonable prices (crab $55 kilo apparently quite pricey though?) and some pretty blemmin good crab. We tried the kang kong, the oyster sauce kai lan, the chicken wings in prawn paste, the steamed bums, and the white pepper and chilli crab. Jury is still out on which one is better... Be warned, the chilli crab is pretty spicy for most ang mo palates, however it didn't stop our British guest getting amongst. Total bill $148 for four people including 3 large tiger beers. We left very full.. I will be back with more of our international visitors. Be prepared to get messy.",

I only ate bamboo clams as a Spanish Tapas and it's a total different experience. They also give you a smashed garlic sauce which is to die for. note: No signboard is mostly known for its white pepper crabs which I haven't tried yet. I subtracted one star for being so pricey for seafood, but it's like that across all popular seafood joints in Singapore, No signboard, Jumbo, and Long Beach. crab= $55/kgbamboo clams= $13 for onefried rice: cheap. $8~12 something unless you order the clam rice.",

    "text": "The crabs are $50/kg which is supposedly pricier than the other restaurants. I'm really not sure what's the market rate. I just assumed they are not cheap. The usual flavors are available- White/Black Pepper, Chilli, Butter, Steamed, Ginger and Spring Onion, Cheese. Can't remember if they have Salted Egg Yolk, which has become one of my favorite flavors for crabs.The Black Pepper crab looks harmless enough but boy is it spicy! Really peppery flavor that turned on the faucet in my nose and had it running for a while. The restaurant gave us the male crab for this dish. I love the kick of the pepper in this dish. You gotta eat this fast because it turns cold due to the lack of a gravy to keep it heated. Apparently the white pepper crab was the original signature dish of NS but now people associate them with Chili crabs. Shall try that another time.NS used to hold the standard for Chili crabs in Singapore (according to this skinnyfat girl that is). Every other chili crab is either too tomato-ish, too diluted, too spicy or too ________(insert something negative here) as compared to NS. I'm sad to say that the standard has indeed fallen. I thought the gravy is watered down a little. It kinda lacks that oomph and punch that it used to possess. While the meat of the crab is succulent as before, the crabs are really pretty puny these days. The image of those HUGE Sri Lankan crab pincers from eons ago is still etched in my memory and the size of the current ones are really disappointing.",

The waiters will put appetizers and wet wipes on the table without telling you it's not free. Thankfully we didn't eat anything so waiters took it away. They also try to upsell you on other entrees. Don't get suckered and just stick to the crab. Also their tea sucks. Costs $2 for Chinese tea and it was basically their version of a Lipton tea bag- bitter. Also they automatically charge 10% service to the bill, but service was the worst. Oh and other restaurants don't charge for service so that was not fun to find out.",

Dress casually as you are going to eat messy chili crab. Price is very reasonable and you get a lot!! \u00a0We got chili crab, fried rice, noodle dish and conch. Fried rice was quite good. \u00a0It wasn't crowded at around 7pm but around 8pm, it was packed. Service is attentive and fast. Highly recommended.",

So no doubt i have tried them numerous time till i find another place in Chinatown.It was so hard for me to love their chili crab, they use a lot of egg yolk and and spice wasn't right, just feel sick afterwards. White pepper crab with leak taste much better, it's tasty and a little spicy. So since then i didn't order any chili crab at any place till a friends' day out in chinatown sea food restaurant, there i found the best chili crab(see my review for Chinatown sea food restauran :)It is a good place to go while you near gaylang area, interesting people watching and culture, for that unique experience it is a must go places :)",

It had a slightly spicy heat to it that left me wanting more. \u00a0The clams are just not my thing. I think the sauce was great though. Only reason it got 4 out of 5 was it took a really long time for the crab to come out. We had basically eaten everything else and were full! Overall, the location was nice, service was decent and their food was good. Would go back for sure.",

    "text": "As a tourist, of course I had to come to No Signboard Seafood Restaurant. \u00a0Even before my trip, I looked up places on Yelp and TripAdvisor and knew I had to come here. \u00a0I didn't know there were other locations and I'm glad I had locals to suggest and take me around and Yelp reviews to read, because I'm glad I went to the original location here in Geylang. \u00a0Apparently the prices at the Geylang location are much more reasonable and they are less likely to jip you out of your hard earned cash here.Valet parking is available for $4. \u00a0No signboard has mostly outdoor seating under plenty of fans, but it also has an indoor area towards the back left corner. \u00a0At night though, it's not so bad outside (and I'm not a fan of Singapore weather at all).No Signboard isn't like your average food centers where a plate of food costs you $3-5. \u00a0It's actually quite expensive. \u00a0Like most established Singaporean restaurants, you can choose the size of your dishes here (S/M/L), but even the small sizes start at double digits. \u00a0Also, as with many other restaurants, they do not provide napkins here. \u00a0I've learned to bring wet wipes and napkins around with me everywhere I go now.Lime juice was okay - tastes like powdered lemonade from the states... not sure if it' anything worth trying.Food:1. Chili crab - must get, obviously. \u00a0The meat was tender and fresh. \u00a0The sauce was spicy for everyone, but not really spicy at all for me. \u00a0Everyone was sweating, but I was fine, so it depends on your spice tolerance.2. Salt/chili fried bullfrog - this was actually my favorite dish out of the bunch. \u00a0Perfectly battered and crispy outside that was salty and a little bit spicy. \u00a0SO GOOD3. Some \u6cb9\u6761 cuttlefish thing - fried goodness4. Some sort of coconut-y fried prawn - no shells - delicious5. Eggplant - standard chinese eggplant dish, but you have to have your veggies!Anyway, make your way to the Geylang resty if you've got a chance.",

I only order the crab + beer + rice. It was ok, i like the black pepper/chili crab that i got from Jumbo better + it has A/C!Maybe I would like their chili crab or black pepper crab better! But... until next time!In the hot summer, this place has no AC and only covers to keep you away from the heat, so choose wisely if you decided to come, probably better to come at night :)",

I was left paying a lot for very little and sadly I was still hungry after leaving the restaurant.Coconut in the shell juice was $5. It was pretty small and considering how coconuts are pretty much a local produce I was expecting it to be cheaper than in the US.Oddly enough they also charge for napkins and towel...seriously?? For the prices you are charging, it should be included.So we ordered Abalone, Scallops, Chilli Crab, and Shrimp.Although as mentioned the food was great, it was hard to justify the prices they were asking for.Scallops were sliced in half to give the impression that \u00a0a lot of scallops were actually served in the dish. This is the same tactic where in Viet cuisine, when you ask for meat balls in your noodle soup, they just give you one meat ball and cut it into four pieces.The Chilli crab was good but there was way too much sauce. The Shrimp sauce was pretty good they made a sweet butternut squash puree.Only come to place if you have a ton of money to fling because or else you'll be pretty hungry after realizing you didn't order enough.",

We know this is a \"hot spot\" for tourist and was expecting a good meal there. We were about to order the crab, but looking at its price, we turned it down. $85 for a crab its a big NO. So we order the other things, black pepper deer meat, drunken prawn, kangkong, and bamboo clam with ice tea and a barley. The good dishes were kangkoong and the clam. Other than that was disappointed us a lot. Drunken prawn was tasteless, the meat were so so, not so much flavor. \u00a0Our bill was $130++ so disappointed for the taste and price. Not worth at all.",

I was super hungry, and ended up eating by myself. That being said, the smallest crab I could get was still huge. It took a bit of time to come out, but was well worth the wait - it was amazing. Juicy, moist, flavorful. Messy as heck, but worth every drip and stain.Mine was not spicy in the slightest. Later, I spoke to a local who told me it was probably because many Singaporeans assume white folks don't like spice. So, lesson learned - next time, ask for spicy, and be firm. Other than that, it was amazing.The place is not cheap, but is so worth it. I would return in a heartbeat.",
