    "text": "I actually really like this place, despite my distaste for most hipster things in Singapore these days. They take reservations online, accept credit cards, have great service, and free wifi.Food-wise... I got two buns; the salted egg shrimp and the nanban along with a side of salad. Gosh! I LOVE the nanban. Freshly fried with some lettuce within, with an awesome tartar sauce. I should have gotten two nanbunsss. The salted egg shrimp was okay - could have been better if the shrimp was deep fried and the sauce could actually coat the shrimp, instead of dripping everywhere. The bun itself was soft and slightly sweet. Yum!I finished off with a banana walnut sundae, quite delish. Would return.",

    "text": "The Bao Makers took over the colourful Windowsill Pies shop that moved to Upper Thomson. Instead of keeping the similar type of decoration, the Bao Makers stripped everything to white. From the outside the caf\u00e9 stood out quite well due to the colour. On the inside, they also kept the minimalistic industrial look with the cemented walls and wooden furnitures, perfect for hipsters to hangout. We visited the Bao Makers on the last day of our holiday when we were quite full from our previous dinner, but at the back of my mind I always remembered my conversation with Em that I'd go and try the bao at this place. So without further contemplation I dragged hubby in and ordered two baos, the chili crab and Korean bulgogi pork. I like both but the succulent and spicy chili crab definitely delivered more flavour especially with the crispy golden bao. I really like the idea of infusing the local dish into the bao, something that I never seen before at other places. The filling for both baos were sufficient. Since Hubby was craving for dessert he also ordered a pretty serving of lemon meringue sundae. The meringue came as the topping in the shape of rose, the rest of the ingredients were lemon sponge, lemon curd and vanilla ice cream with almond slices. It was delicious but a bit awkward to be called a sundae except if you break the meringue and the sponge cake, then mix the whole thing together with the ice cream.  We had a good time at the Bao Makers and we hope they will be a one stop shop for bao and able to come up with a lot of different fillings next time we go to Singapore.",

    "text": "Such a cute little spot on Horne Road. I appreciate that they focus on giving baos a bit of a twist.The baos are all Asian inspired, with flavours like bulgogi, salted egg shrimp, and teriyaki chicken. I stuck with the classic (slow-braised pork belly) and the nanban chicken, which was a deep fried chicken with Japanese tartar sauce.The classic had all the right flavours involved, however I found the meat a tad dry. I still think Ubin Kitchen on Joo Chiat Road holds the title for best classic bao in SG! I really liked the nanban chicken, though- perfectly deep fried and the sauce paired well.Ambiance is simple, though it can get a bit loud and echo-y when there's a lot of people. Other than that, a cute cafe worth checking out if you're looking for something a little different!",

    "text": "Nice space but average food. A 2.5 stars review.The baos are tiny for the prices that they are charging - about $5.50 for one depending on the fillings. You'll need \u00a0at least 2 to fill you up (they also require a min of 2 baos per order). So a meal here will set you up for more than $10. Aside from the price, the taste doesn't quite make the cut. While the nanban chicken (fried chicken) is nicely fried and served out piping hot and crispy, the marinate on the chicken doesn't come through and there is also too much mayo with the tiny piece of chicken.The chilli crab bun is a take on a Singaporean favorite. While it is full of real shredded crabs, the accompanying sauce is a diluted chilli liquid that has nothing of the usual eggy crabby gravy of a good chilli crab sauce. Place is typically hipster with nice simple decor but the taste and value of the food is not enough to bring me back.",

    "text": "As I rarely come to this area, I have no idea the existence of this cafe, thanks to Natalie. From Lavender MRT station, the walk takes around 10 minutes, but do bring an umbrella if the weather forecast is rain as there is no shelter for most parts of the walk: When I think of 'Bao' (Chinese bread), I expect a Chinese style cafe or something like that but when I entered the cafe, it was different from what I expected. I didn't read the review or find out about more this cafe as I wanted to get an element of surprise and I did! The cafe is quite spacious as there is good amount of privacy between you and the other customers. If you are in a big group (around 6-10), you be pleased to know there is a Long table and if needed, they just add a table or two. Perfect for some catching up as its quiet and not crowded for most of the time, according to another Yelper. Orders are self service and free wifi is available but you have to ask the staff for the password. It would be nice if they could leave the password either on the table or on the receipt. Staff were friendly and more importantly no sign of impatience or pressure to leave the cafe even though the group had finish the food for quite some time and got lost in the wonderful conversation. I ordered the Namban Chicken and Classic (check my photo of the menu for more information) and I find them to be my liking for my taste bud. Not the best but decent enough for me to make another trip back to try out the other flavours. Prices is reasonable and portion is definitely value for money. Overall, this is a great cafe for catching up and enjoying the \"bao\"! Do drop by if you are nearby or have a craving for \"Bao\".",

    "text": "My new favorite neighborhood spot. I love places that just make a few things but do them well. The Nanban Chicken bao was my favorite. The chicken is juicy, and the skin perfectly crispy and light, and the Japanese tartar sauce is just right. My wife had the classic pork belly and salted egg shrimp bao, which were also both excellent but not quite as good as the chicken for my taste. Lastly, their truffle fries were a bit on the salty side, but full of cheesy truffley goodness. Besides the food, the decor is right up my alley. Clean and modern, wide open spaces and gray and brown accents. Service was super fast, which is another big plus with places that have small menus. We had our bao in less than five minutes after ordering, which is great for a case of mid-afternoon munchies.",

    "text": "clean and open concept cafe. Finally a cafe where there is actually space and i don't feel claustrophobic. Headed straight in. Ordered an Ice- Latte to start, 5 minutes later its done and i have to say its really pretty good. Being at a Bao place. You've got to try the baos right? so i went straight for the shrimp with salted egg yolk one. The bummer was that it was a minimum order of 2 baos, and i really had wanted to sit down and relax and not stuff myself with 2 baos. But i understand the procedure as steaming just one bao would be quite a waste of steam i suppose. so i had to go for the traditional one. The classic \"kong bak\" bao/pork belly. The shrimp one could do with a more stronger salted egg yolk sauce, but all in all, the shrimp was fresh and crisp. As for the pork belly bao, it would be nice if it had a thicker sauce around the meat. The staff here are friendly and would go the extra mile to help. So the next time you're around horne road or going to catch a soccer match at the jalan besar stadium. Come over and get yourself a great cup of coffee and some baos. A great place for an afternoon snack, brunch or a light dinner.",
