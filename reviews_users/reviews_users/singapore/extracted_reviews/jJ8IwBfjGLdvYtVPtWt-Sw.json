Good flavors and seasoning, and all the right ingredients. I'd come back for sure.Con:The portions are a bit small for the price.",

    "text": "Mex Out is one of the better Mexican joints in Singapore.I agree with Michelle that their food tends on the salty side (still) but it wasn't as overpowering as described in her review. Perhaps they got the message and took the salt down a notch, but just a notch - so maybe my burrito had only 2 days worth of daily recommended allowance for sodium but it was still a worthwhile treat.I had a large pork burrito with cheese and sour cream (an extra $0.50 each) with a side order of big chips which comes with your choice of salsa and a canned drink or water. Everything clocked in at just under $20 which I've begrudgingly resigned to accept as the norm around these parts.Service is quick and courteous with a lot of comfortable seating options inside and outside.The queue can be quite long during peak lunch hours so come during off-peak times to enjoy your burrito in peace.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner on a Wed evening, it was fairly quiet. \u00a0Decor inside was quite pleasant and the service staff were very friendly and helpful. \u00a0My girlfriend had a mini burrito. \u00a0Good flour tortilla, really yummy rice and the chicken was really juicy and tasty (which is surprising given that in its cube form it looks really plain). \u00a0The downside - the burrito wasn't wrapped properly. \u00a0The moment she unwrapped it from the foil, one part of it had already become undone and the rice was spilling out. \u00a0A far cry from Chipotle (or any other) burritos in the States where it's wrapped tighter than a peranakan grandma's hair bun. \u00a0I had 3 Tacos. \u00a0Paid extra $2 to have beef barbacoa in one and Carne (also beef) in another, and the 3rd was pulled pork (which would normally be regular price - it's extra $2 as long as you order some kind of premium meat i.e. either of the beef or, i think, the lamb which they didn't have when we went). \u00a0Surprisingly, the best of the 3 was definitely the pork (the cheapest option) - tasty and juicy. \u00a0Both iterations of beef were kind of dry. \u00a0Also, they had corn tortillas which didn't taste like they came out of the freezer (unlike almost every other corn tortilla I've had in sg). \u00a0They weren't bad. \u00a0I wonder who makes corn tortillas in Singapore.Oh also they have quite a few different salsas to choose from. \u00a0About 6 I think? \u00a0I was lost in indecision and the girl helpfully offered to put on what she suggested would go with each meat. \u00a0Had the mango salsa (no spice) with the pork - quite nice! \u00a0The other two were the Verde (not very spicy) and... a red one. \u00a0I forget which. \u00a0It also wasn't very spicy. My girlfriend found the guacamole somewhat salty. \u00a0I don't usually have guac so hard for me to comment on that myself.One final thing - we were looking forward to chocolate and churros there but the owner said they were still \"perfecting the recipe\" for the churros. \u00a0Sad. \u00a0Price-wise, it was pretty reasonable especially for downtown. \u00a0My girlfriend's mini burrito was $8 I think. \u00a0The 3 Tacos were $13 plus $2 for the premium meat, and they added 10% service charge - I have no idea why they charge service charge when you order and pay at the counter. \u00a0Portions were not huge by any means.Overall, not the best ever but not bad. \u00a0I would go back again for some decent mid-priced Tacos, especially the chicken and the pork.",

It's been over a year, and this time I tried the small 10-inch chicken burrito (to save money and calories.) Luckily it wasn't as salty as last time but the chicken was a bit too dry for me, and the rice seemed like it was drenched in tomato sauce and slightly undercooked. At least they set up the burrito right, as I got a taste of all ingredients during each bite (unlike Baja Fresh, which really needs learn the basics of burrito making.)Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong thing. Should I be doing tacos? Barbacoa burritos? Carne Asada burritos? I still love the branding and the vibe, and it's definitely a nice place to chill and have a beer... but I have yet to find the one food item that'll make me add one more star.",

I agree that it reminded me of Chipotle.I like getting either the salad bowl or the rice bowl - the latter being if i'm ESPECIALLY HUNGRY because it's kinda a lot of food. The you can mix and match your own meat, beans, sauces, and whatever add-ons you want to your dish. Whatever you do, go with the pork - it's good. For sauces, I like their mango salsa and picante.And that's all really. I've been going here for my mexican fix because of the convenient location (it's in the CBD). But truth to be told Singapore is still in the market for a good, proper mexican food.",

While I cant say its as good in the burrito department they have some good food. Its more of a quick eats type place. You can pick between a burrito, taco, salad and nachos. \u00a0Then you add on a variety of toppings. The rice was ok but I miss the lime cilantro rice from chipotle. \u00a0The toppings were good, the veggies were very tasty and they had a variety of good salsas. \u00a0With the meat and beans added in it became a bit soupy so I think they should do a better job at draining it before adding it in to the burrito. \u00a0You can also get beers, margaritas and tequilas which seems fine but not when your heading back to work, maybe after. \u00a0 Its a nice place, good service, not really chipotle but the closest youll get in singapore for sure. \u00a0Definitely worth checking out so if you like mexican food give it a try.",

But I was so excited at the prospect of a burrito place that was \"chipotle-like\" according to a certain publication that I forwarded the info to a number of my friends working in the area. Side note, I've learnt to not trust recommendations from said publication because I've had several blah experiences based on their rec's to date.Anyway I went to Mex Out yesterday with my friend, J, who was/is my bestie from our time at UVA. She had the tacos and I had a burrito with cochinita pibil, pinto & black beans, sour cream, lettuce, 2 salsa's and guacamole (why do I have to pay $2 more for guac?). The portions were decent if you consider how much an average meal costs in Raffles Place (or at least that's what I keep telling myself everyday).How'd it go? Uh it was really salty. At first I thought hmm maybe it's just the beans. Took that out and ate the pork with the rest of the ingredients...nope still salty. I eat hawker food pretty regularly (hello salty chwee kuay at ghim moh) so it's not like I had some salt sensitivity issues. So I still finished my burrito like a good Asian person but boy did I have that icky \"man I need some water\" feeling afterwards. Actually now that I've read some of the reviews below, I realize I'm not the only one who felt their food was salty. Oh well, maybe I'll be back for the alcohol?",

Table service isn't really an option, you order at the counter so it's very cafeteria style. We had some corn chips and guacamole... the corn chips were freshly fried and the guac was chunky and fresh. Decent snack for $6.We both had the rice-bowl (effectively the burrito without the tortilla) which was a good size and well tasty... go down the cafeteria chain and choose your beans, your protein, the salad, and your salsa (lots to choose from). Guac and cheese costs extra (which I don't agree with, but whatever). The tacos looked like a good share option, as do the nachos. Service was mixed... the guys were friendly, the sole girl looked like she wanted to be anywhere but behind the counter. Maybe some edgy music could give the place a bit more vibe? It was lacking in atmosphere somewhat but if you're just after something tasty to fill the belly, then maybe this is for you. I'd go back for a quick bite... or maybe go for drinks at one of the numerous neighbouring bars and then go to Mexout to soak up the alcohol!",
