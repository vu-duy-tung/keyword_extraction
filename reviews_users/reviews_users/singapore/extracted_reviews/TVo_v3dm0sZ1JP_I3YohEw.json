    "text": "I've been wanting to try out Shiraz for a while. It came recommended by an Iranian friend when I mentioned that we were looking for a good Mediterranean restaurant. It's a little on the pricey side, so we waited till a special occasion -- a birthday. When I called to make a reservation, the restaurant offered to have the belly dancer bring out the cake, which I thought was really nice of them. The restaurant was empty when we arrived at 7pm, but it was full by 8pm. This was a Sunday by the way. I found the menu overwhelming, despite being semi-comfortable in most Middle Eastern restaurants. \u00a0I think it was the use of Turkish names that were non-familiar -- for instance there were two eggplants dishes that were not baba ganoush on the appetizers. I think it would have been helpful to have sorted the main dishes by type of meat, and also add a short English description in the title (not in the long detailed description), but the restaurant's been around so I'm sure they know what they are doing. Part of the menu is reserved for halal food.We chickened out, and ordered a platter for 4, the vegetarian option and a lamb stew. The appetizer list was shorter, and we went with both eggplant dishes, hummus and the lamb meatballs. The appetizers were awesome, especially the bread. We had three orders of bread, and they were complimentary...although we did order 4 appetizers. I'm not sure if they eventually charge for bread. After the appetizers, we were starting to feel kind of full. Oh, we were a party of 7.The main platter was huge -- definitely more than enough food for 4 people. I think we could have just gotten the platter for our party of 7. It came with a couple of roasted tomatoes and a few slices of carrots, so it was a good idea to add the vegetarian main to our dinner. The grilled vegetables were interesting -- there were the usual bell peppers, zucchini and potatoes, and then more. Roasted celery! Roasted lotus root! They were actually really good! The meat platter was done well, but I didn't find any of the food remarkable.The belly dancer came out after 8:30pm, and started dancing in the restaurant. The arrangement of the tables made it hard to properly see her dancing. After the first song, she danced outside the restaurant at the front door for 2 more songs, which we couldn't quite see. If you're here to see the belly dancer, you're better off waiting outside.The restaurant felt a little understaffed. It took a while for them to clear the plates, and a lot longer to bring out the dishes after the belly dancer gave us the cake. However, the wait staff was very friendly. We definitely had a great time.",

I order the Spicy Chicken Wrap and it was terrible! 1- It didn't taste like chicken.2- I couldn't taste the spiciness of the chicken... or any actual spice! #BLEND3- There were so many onions in my wrap, I thought I was eating a raw onion. I know I'm not exaggerating because my boyfriend tried it and thought the same thing. 4- After eating what it was the most horrible \"kebab wrap\" in history, I couldn't go to sleep because I still had that onion taste in my mouth!Do yourself a favor and run away from this place.",

Food maybe good, over priced and bad service.If you are going alone, they will refuse to give you a table and even if they give they will skip giving you bread and cheese etc. They want you out. They just want your money and out. Service is not something they know. But they will charge you 10% for service. This is something i do not get here. If you are a non drinker same treatment. What is most interesting Singapore being such a Hot place they do not even offer water. They want you to Buy water. That itself is a put off. The charge you like crazy but even tap water is not offered.My suggestion best avoided. Go to Arab Street etc to get middle eastern food. Not SHIRAZ..",

    "text": "Brilliant middle eastern restaurant. Top-notch food, great service, and amazing entertainment.I was here for a group (10) dinner during a work trip. A couple of my colleagues had been before and said it was good. One of them is friends with one of the dancers as well.Staff were helpful in suggesting the right options and amounts of food for 9 hungry carnivores and 1 vegetarian. A couple of their sample platters and few sides, with some nibbles of mezze and hummus before, were just right to ensure we were left fat and happy. All the food was excellently prepared and presented, with a mix of lamb, beef, and fish.Service was very quick, the wine we ordered was always topped up when needed, and we genuinely felt very well-treated.The belly dancers that are a regular part of the evening here were amazing. Their dancing had some modern moves in it, and some purists might say that these tiny Asian ladies didn't quite have substantial enough bellies for it, but it was a real crowd-pleasing show. While some of the dancing was inside, in and around each table, much of it was outside the entrance, to bring in more customers. Luckily our table was aligned perfectly with the doorway so we got to see nearly the entire show.A fun night of great food and entertainment.",

Here is is my view:Pro: 1. nice location & decoration2. Good serviceCon: 1. extremely expensive: minimum price from for grill is $$37 which is about $25 (US); this 30% higher than NY with less quantity2. The portion to price is out of placeDinner for 4 (main dish plus appetizer and desert is about $70/$80 a person which is outrages.",

Please tourist bullshit. I'm from New York and I've been to Turkey and Israel and this is the worst shwarma I've ever had. And the sauce which usually makes any meat taste better.. well this one made it worse.Anyway this cheesy wrap thing was good I guess. It just wasn't shwarma. Or even remotely middle eastern in my opinion. Sorry... try again.",

    "text": "I tried the Shiraz twin platter ( gives you a good array of their signature charcoal grilled kebabs) and it was absolutely fab. The meats were succulent, juicy and very tasty. And they also gave us a complimentary portion of persian flat bread with hummus, which were really good too.But enough about the food! The most memorable part of the dinner was the belly dancer, who will perform around the restaurant and between the tables. I usually find it quite awkward to watch someone perform while I eat. The food will usually distract me from half the performance and yet you have to show some decent amount of appreciation to the performer. I felt a bit strange throughout the dance (juggling the eating and appreciative smiles and nods). But from my observation, that dance definitely kept the male guests happy if they aren't already happy with the food.",

The establishment has posted an opening time of 6:00PM; we arrived here at 6, waiting for about 15 minutes with no one attending to us, then went across to District10 because they still hadn't finished their \"staff meeting\". We then came back at 6:45 when they were finally done after having a couple of drinks and appetizers at District10. We ordered a Shisha and were then told we need to order 1 drink per person, which is fine because we knew that as this is the 4th time we've come here since getting to Singapore, but as we had just had drinks, we asked for a few minutes before we order something and they wouldn't let us sit until we ordered something. Furthermore, my wife was having a Starbucks which is not allowed on their premises, so I said it's fine, she'll finish it and they insisted she stand 2 meters away at the entrance of the restaurant and chug the Starbucks if she wants to enter. Mind you, we have been here 4 times in a week and we've been very good with the staff, and they've even come to recognize us so I am surprised at how poor the service is. There are MANY better places for Shisha in the town, Sahara at Boat Quay, and Dervish and a couple of other places on Arab St, maybe not as fancy, but the service is 100 times better.",
