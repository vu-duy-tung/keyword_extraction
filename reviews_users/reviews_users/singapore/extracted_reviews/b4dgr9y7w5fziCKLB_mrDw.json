    "text": "I had dinner at Marutama tonight after several years. I ordered the regular ramen with pork. The noodles were soft, which was to my liking, but may be considered overdone for those who like theirs al dente. The broth was also a tad too salty for my liking, though I did finish most of it. There was a generous serving of spring onions, which I thought was disproportionate to the broth and noddles. Garlic, sesame and chilli powder were provided. \u00a0This are 3-4 types of ramen available, with spicy or non-spicy chicken broth options. Aside from these, they also offer some gyozas and 1-2 rice options. There is a queue during peak hours.",

    "text": "The queues at Marutama stretches excessively on certain nights and after my experience, I just can't figure out why.Admittedly, Marutama is immensely generous with the toppings on the Ramen provided for the Liang Court Food Trail with 3 slices of Char Siu, 2 pieces of Pork Belly Kakuni, a Tamago (Boiled Flavoured Egg) and plenty of Negi (Spring Onions) and Seaweed. However, the star of the night, the ramen noodles and soup itself, was a disappointment and having tried favourites like Santouka and Nantsuttei, I feel that Marutama is just not up to par. The soup, being chicken-based, lacks the thick flavourful consistency that pork-based soups provide and doesn't pack a punch. The noodles were stringy and felt sadly like the noodles I get from instant ramen that can be purchased at Medi-ya Supermarket.Still, one thing I did enjoy, immensely, was the boiled Tamago, which is the best I have had at a local ramen place. With solid egg whites browned from soaking overnight in flavoured vinegar and a molten yolk inside, Marutama definitely puts alot of effort into a dish many cannot master and this was the star of the evening. Other toppings like Char Siu and Negi were average while the Kakuni reminded me too much of Chinese braised pork belly.For the full review and more pictures, visit voraciousappetite.wordpr\u2026",
