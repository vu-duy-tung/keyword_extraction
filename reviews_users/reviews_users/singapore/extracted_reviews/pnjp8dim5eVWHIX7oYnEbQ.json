    "text": "Espresso - this was a potent, robust and strong shot with a lingering aftertaste, but also a good balance of taste and flavours. This is not surprising - Jimmy Monkey's Ironbark blend is a combination of beans from Brazil (Cerrado), Papua New Guinea (Sigri), Columbia (Kachru), Guatamala (La Laguna) and Peru (Amazonas). There is also a Columbian single origin blend available, which works well in pourover coffee. Each bean variety contributes something unique to the shot - hints of citrus, and even some chocolate notes. Ironbark is a blend that is still evolving, and is now on it's third iteration. The experimentation has paid off, leaving a full bodied shot with a lingering aftertaste.The cappuccino that I ordered was notable for the initial strong hit of coffee flavour, complemented by smooth, light foam and finished with well executed latte art. The microbubbles in the foam add the smooth, silky mouthfeel that I look for, and is seen in quality cafes. This is where Ironbark is used to good effect - the lingering aftertaste is a strong base for a milk based drink, ensuring that the fundamental coffee character is retained.I had a Piccolo also, which is characterised by a more robust coffee taste, with the aftertaste lasting through the milk and foam. The milk complements the robust coffee flavour, smoothing it but not smothering it, creating a hybrid which retains the best characteristics of each - its just right and well executed. Their original place in the piccolo latte hall of fame post is deserved, and retained. There are also pourover, syphon and chemex coffees available. This is a good choice for anyone in the West of the island, and worth a quick trip on the MRT for coffee lovers elsewhere.",

I am completely in love with the turquoise shade of its cups so it might've made me a little more biased towards my drinks. Jimmy Monkey serves coffee with a richer and bolder profile so be sure to note that when you get your cup there. I haven't gotten round to trying their food menu but it features some pastas and other mains which did look delish enough. My friend enjoyed her aglio olio. Plus, I really liked the open kitchen concept which makes the experience more wholesome, almost like stepping into the kitchen of a friend's home.",

It is one of those hidden places in the uncharted territory of one-north. To be honest, it isn't that difficult to find and is merely a 7 minute walk from one-north MRT station if you take the right exit (exit B). The service is great and the staff are really friendly and helpful, offering me recommendations of their foods and drinks as I stared at the menu. There is also free wifi, and being hidden away from the crowd it makes a good quiet place for getting some work done on a weekday afternoon. The place has a homely, yet pretty rough industrial vibe. I can't really place it but its a gruff kind of cool. They do a good cup of flat white and the coffee has a bold full-bodied flavour that is pretty satisfying. I had a go at their new introduction to the menu, the yolkless cheesecake, and have to say that it was so goooood! It was rich without being heavy, it is almost like having the best of both worlds. Other than the fact that the place smells of fried food as they have an open concept kitchen, it is a pretty ideal cafe find!",

    "text": "Checked out Jimmy Monkey Cafe and struck it off my cafe list. Finally! With it being at One-North, its really kinda difficult to get to, but actually it was quite convenient via the Circle Line and it is actually just one stop away from Holland Village! Heard some good things about this place, but was also warned that it gets really stuffy and smelly inside because they cook food inside without proper ventilation! So I approached the door with trepidation, because I really don't like greasy smells on me after I leave a food place.Luckily that didn't happen! It was actually quite empty, with a few patrons, perhaps that's why there was not much cooking. The aircon perched on the high ceiling was on a full blast.I was taking photos of the place upon walking in when the chefs and barista gamely posed for a photo (w/o me asking!). That's so cute, and funny. The cafe has a little bit of an abandoned warehouse industrial feel, yet they made it rather New York lofty as well. The decor is casual but comfortable.I was expecting a much smaller place as well, but the size was actually quite spacious with very high ceilings.Prices are ok! $4-6 for coffees, and they have alcoholic drinks too. They also do the Lazy Weekend menu. Looks quite awesome, might have to go back and try! What I hear is that they roast and sell their own coffees. Perhaps I was lucky, but the cafe was a very good experience for me. Venture forth with the warning on the smell, and hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",

    "text": "The JFDI cafe at Blk 71, Ayer Rajar Crescent, has longer been servin' up their wonderful coffees made with Jimmy Monkey's beans! Initially, I thought \"Jimmy Monkey\" was a supplier of coffee beans. To my surprise they are a cafe which roast their own beans (and hence name it after themselves)! A very hipster one in fact! My friend brought me there after lunch to grab a Soya latte which I was skeptical about at first. My prejudice against Soya lattes stems from the fact that their drinkers are commonly stereotyped as dieters. Refusing to be labelled as one of them, I have abstained from ordering a Soya latte... until today. My friend was raving about their Soya latte so much - how light & nutty it was... etc - that I knew I had to give it a try (at least just this once). Anyways, it was a quick-in-&-out dash not long enough for any snooty purist coffee drinker to give me the stink eye for ordering a Soya latte. So I did it. To my surprise... the Soya latte was really GOOD... even better than normal latte! I am a convert. It had a nice nutty flavor (just as my friend promised) and doesn't taste like the sweet stuff you get from Mr.Bean or at soybean packet drinks from NTUC. The Soya milk didn't overpower the coffee flavor. In fact, it tasted a lot like milk ... only less creamy (which I prefer) ... & thus help enhance the coffee ( I think). I was pleasantly surprised. The brand of Soya milk they used is called - Silk - which I am told is one of the best. Can't wait to grab a pack at the nearest cold storage on my way home.My next coffee will definitely be a Soya Latte!",

Had no idea where to park since the place is situated inside a private condo. Had to just find a space nearby. There is an open air carpark not far if \u00a0you're not lazy to walk. I love the industrial look of its interior - high ceilings with random book shelves. It's very open and spacious too. It was very quiet when we came. The staff are mostly made up of a bunch of young boys.We were only there for coffee and dessert because we've had our lunch but looking at the tempting food menu, I'm definitely coming again to try some of their food. I ordered a latte and a cheesecake. The coffee is a good hit of bold flavours. The cheesecake (and most of the desserts) were really pricey (most cost more than $6). For the price, I didn't think it was worth it, I'd rather spend more and get a good meal. But otherwise, we enjoyed just hanging out and reading some magazines, it had a somewhat homely vibe.Final verdict: Whoever Jimmy Monkey is, he'll have me swinging by again for the coffee and tempting food menu!",

It was tasteless and even felt like not finishing because the taste was horrible. For 10$ I can cook way better at home, never felt more sad paying 50$ for a brunch before, and we have been to many different brunch places before.The only thing that was good was the cafe latte that my wife ordered, for the rest....

Literally tiny, this spot feels spacious which leaves the customer feeling cozy and comfortable. Self serve water bottles (nicely done) and the music was decent. \u00a0Staff was friendly...in a From Dusk Till Dawn kind of way. \u00a0The bad: Every time I find a new brunch place I find myself praying that the food delivers. This time, my prayers were not answered. I ordered the eggs benedict, which we borderline inedible. Had it not been for the fact that I walked around 10 mins trying to find the place and was starving I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did. But, and there is a but, it was a matter of ingredients and not execution. The muffin was grainy and doughy, ham was thick and dry and the hollandaise was sour and sparse. The greens the put on the plate were straight from a salad packet you get at Fair Price. \u00a0The egg, surprisingly, was cooked perfectly. The person purchasing the ingredients really needs to step it up because they are ruining an otherwise capable kitchen. The ugly: Too secluded and not tasty enough for a must return. Also, the pricing is too high ($30+ for eggs benedict, OJ and latte) and there wasn't anything that stood out (including the drinks). It's a shame because the ambience was there. \u00a0I think this will remain a One-North residents hangout for now.",

The cafe has a Melbournian vibe going for it. No surprise as it's owned and run by a guy from Melbourne who craved a slice of home. They make a big deal out of how they have a Slayer machine. I'm not that much of a coffee geek although I drink a lot of it.Their coffee is above average. And pretty strong, stronger than most others'. I know because coffee tends to have no effect on me although I drink gallons of it, but I do visibly perk up a bit from Jimmy Monkey cafe. Taste-wise they have a stronger, slightly more bitter profile to their coffee.They're probably the only coffee place to do 'serious' food, as in they have a huge food menu. Most of it is executed quite well. I wouldn't go as far as to say the food is great, but it's comforting and quite unique. They have toast soldiers, good tarts, decent desserts, savoury pastas and a lot of sandwiches. All of those things are, I feel, better than their breakfast sets. But I don't like eggs and meat for brekkie so I guess I'm not the target demographic. The pastas are quite good though.They also have Asahi and some other alcohol, but I haven't had a good time or reason to drink here. I remember them being quite affordably priced though!",

    "text": "Once upon a time, a little card advertised a list of independent coffee shops on an island. \u00a0A girl picked up that card and memorized it and spent the next two years of her life visiting each coffee shop in turn. \u00a0Her last coffee shop was Jimmy Monkey Bar.It is so in the middle of nowhere. I am sure the residents and nearby laborers appreciate this coffee shop but it is just too out of the way for anyone else to get here. \u00a0I finally made the effort because I had to have a meeting near Holland V. \u00a0I was struck by the strange interior; it doesn't match the vibe of the website. \u00a0Call me crazy, but consistent branding is something I pay attention too.When I first ordered they were charging me $15 for a beet salad so I negotiated for a smaller salad at 2/3 the price and was a little happier but it still seemed expensive. \u00a0I wasn't going to argue with the iced latte. \u00a0I love it and would pay every penny for it. The coffee flavor was strong and nutty and they used the good milk. \u00a0My beet salad was fine and my friend seemed to like his banana muffin. \u00a0We sat undisturbed for two hours sipping coffee and chatting. \u00a0Sort of sad such a quiet place isn't a little closer to me; but then it wouldn't be quiet.",

If it would have been around the corner I could have visited again but not at all worth traveling this far for. Also had a decent brekkie muffin and a pasta with mushrooms. Not bad but also a bit overpriced.What was however a pleasant surprise was that the staff were friendly and helpful. Service was also smooth and fast despite the place being packed.",

A mix of residences nearby, young families, partners for brunch. If u need only the caffeine fix, JM Too is across the pathway and have the new Slayers.\u00a0On to the food. Simple menu, doesn't offer everything under the Suns. The small things make a difference. Like mesclun salad over iceberg lettuce, ripe avacados, fresh ciabatta. Price point are on the higher side, but I'm finding that across the island these days. Portions are ample and generous. Quality and freshness on the ingredients. You don't get a 'that's it!?' reaction when the plate is served.\u00a0And lastly the coffee never misses. Very much recommended.",

Jimmy Monkey is no different. Egg's Benedict will run you a whopping $24, pancakes are $14, and the french toast is $17.They had run out of pancakes on a Sunday at noon so I went with the french toast, and added on a chocolate, peanut butter, speculoos shake for good measure. This was not a wallet-friendly brunch but I was happily surprised by how tasty everything was. The french toast comes in a healthy serving, and includes berries and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. By the end I was actually struggling to finish my serving because everything was so sweet.I wouldn't be opposed to returning but this place is definitely a treat, and not a joint for regular meals. Seating is fairly limited, but somehow sufficient for the number of patrons. It gets a little warm, and the space does feel a little cramped. Nonetheless there are a variety of seating options depending on what you're up to.",

And there's no queue, not much of a crowd throughout the night. Yes, it's QUIET. A rare gem I would say.I also really admire the fact I could drink coffee, look up and there you are, a TOILET BOWL complete with toilet paper right above my head. It's so randomly ridiculous yet genius that I LURVE IT. I even took a picture of it, go see.I ordered the banana bread pudding, - $14, and coffee. The presentation of the bread pudding was very cute, it came in a pot, on a wooden slab. Coffee was better than most cafes I've been to, and service was... Let's just say that they let you do your own thing, and they do theirs, and if both lines should intersect, colourful unicorns will bloom. Pricing is on the high side.One thing that made me feel like getting up to leave, was the glaring red neon lighting fixture, that engulfed me and my companion. It reminded me of an episode in Seinfeld (who else still watches this?!) where Kramer's entire room emitted a red glow because Kenny Rogers moved opposite his room and their crazy signboard faced his window.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews.",

    "text": "I'll just get this out of the way first. I'm probably one of five people in the world that doesn't drink coffee. I know how to grind beans and make coffee in a french press for my mum, I love the smell of coffee brewing and when it pops up in savory food and sweets...but I just hate the taste of coffee as a drink. No matter how much milk, sugar, nothing, best beans, kona beans, any beans, my man has tried to get me to drink it and the most I've tolerated is 2 sips. The one time I drank a caramel latte in Japan because I totally misread the menu, it was really sweet and suddenly I was talking non-stop for an hour. Since this IS a coffee joint, my dude has his two cents in this review. He had a decaf black and in his words \"it's wonderful. very smooth\". So there.Now on to the food. We're really brunch people so we were looking for food more than coffee. When I say I'm a brunch person it's not because I like to dress up to eat a meal I can cook at home. I'm actually a hungry person, I like brunch foods and someone always wakes up too late to fire up the pan. Anyway, we had the french toast and a breakfast sandwich (can't remember the exact name) and both were pretty good. \u00a0My french toast was made of 3 thick slices of brioche sliced up, drizzled with a caramel sauce with bananas and nuts drizzled over. It was beautiful to see and a hearty portion for my rumbling tummy. Here's the problem: the egg wash wasn't soaked through the bread. Whhhhhhhhy? It would've been perfect otherwise. If there's a monkey jimmy listening - please soak the toast, turn the heat low and cook that baby.The breakfast sandwich was a standout. A generous, fluffy omelet sandwiched between avocado slices, ciabatta and a sweet-ish tomato chutney. It was brilliant, huge and I would eat it again. And again. So that's a winner right there.What didn't I like? The guys on shift probably partied until 4am and decided to bring their music to work. Bad trance music in a coffee shop is just wrong. Especially at 2pm on a Saturday. That gave me a headache and I shouldn't be getting one at a place where there's a toilet bowl watching me eat.",

    "text": "Imagine a hipster cafe with above average prices and decidedly average food.Congratulations, you've successfully imagined Jimmy Monkey Cafe & Bar.In all seriousness, I found the food to be decent but not worth raving about or coming back for. \u00a0It seemed as though JMC&B was trying to get that Saturday morning breakfast cafe feel, like the ones that you'd find by the beach in California or Hawaii, but they fell a bit short. \u00a0If they're going to charge the prices they do, I feel there should be something special that sets them at least a little bit apart, but I didn't think there was anything that special here.Last mark against them is the lack of space. \u00a0JMC&B feels very cramped, as we were slotted into what felt like a tiny corner of a wooden shack.",

The food is delicious and uncomplicated. The staff is friendly and unpretentious. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. Free wifi if you need it. Quirky & clever little bits all around to show you that the proprietor & his staff enjoy what they do.",

But for a quant place to grab a smoothie or cup of coffee and a light bite this might be a good stop. \u00a0 Tried the pulled pork sandwich on a buttered bun served with potatoes lyonnaise and also tried the tartine called \"the hulk\" - open face rustic bread sandwich covered in avocado and feta served on a bed of arugula. \u00a0The banana-strawberry smoothie was \"nice\" (says the SPG) and the mocha was delightful!",

Out of the place (a short walk from One North MRT) but convenient if you have a car.Good place to chill out on a weekend afternoon but it might be a bit crowded to get some reading done.Absolutely love the washrooms as it was decorated so beautifully with bookshelves (my absolute dream intention to my own bathroom) with books and cards!",
