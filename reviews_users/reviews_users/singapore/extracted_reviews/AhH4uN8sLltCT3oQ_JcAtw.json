    "text": "Generous portions, chicken breast is smooth and juicy, and really flavourful. Vegetables and char siew are pretty good, but not really standouts. Quick, friendly service and reasonable prices. Maybe the only negative is the lack of variety on the menu (or the lack of a menu at all), but that's probably the only reason they can serve so fast.To get a table, you'll probably have to come before 630pm for dinner on weekends. There's a long queue for takeaway orders too. Overall, this is way better than Hawker Chan's (also in Toa Payoh).",

    "text": "Had this chicken rice at around 1pm was afraid to meet the lunch crowd but thankfully able to grab seats. The chicken is smooth and tender. For a person who hardly eats roast pork, their roast pork is pretty good. Crispy and juicy. I didn't get to eat their dumpling soup as I'm allergic to prawns but my boyfriend got to enjoy them. I can literally count the amount of prawns they put in each dumpling. (I was expecting the minced the prawns instead of putting whole prawns in)Whether I'll come again, definitely yes for a quick simple lunch.",

    "text": "It's different. It's rich in flavour. It's old in ways of preparation. You can actually taste how things used to be back then.This chicken rice is class. No frills, just like how they used to make'em in the old days. \u00a0Nothing superbly spectacular about it as a whole but you can tell that it's something special.It's a slightly above average plate of chicken rice that gets you there for sure. But there's something about that taste that brings you back to olden days Singapore food. The star however does not lie in the rice or noodles or chilli, the chicken is definitely one of the softest and most moist I've ever eaten!The sauce is uber thick but a tad starchy. It had a slight herbal flavour to it which made it fragrant. This is definitely a very unique alternative to your everyday normal plate of chicken rice. I do for see myself coming back again just for that soft sweet chicken.P.S - Things are a little bit more to the sweet side than salty here I noticed.3.2 STARS",

    "text": "Sweet, sweet, chicken rice. The sauce is the magic in this hard to pronounce restaurant. LEE FUN NAM KEE (combination of founder's and his wife's surnames). Now don't forget that because this is where you will experience the sweetest chicken rice sauce ever. The brown sauce that comes with the soya sauce chicken is thick and starchy and so flavourful. You can mix the chicken with the chicken rice and you're set, your meal is complete. If you're not easily satisfied, there are the standard veggies that you can order as a side, the veggies - Kai Lan, comes with sinful pieces of pork lard. YUMMEH. The price of the dishes are higher than your usual chicken rice in the kopitiam but this is a semi-restaurant leh, so the price is not that bad la. The restaurant is always crowded on meal times, both weekdays and weekends. Do make your bookings beforehand.",

    "text": "Lee Fun Nam Kee is a reminder that there's more than one way of preparing your chicken rice. I personally like the \"normal\" Hainanese version, i.e. plain \"white\" boiled. However, this restaurant, in addition to serving it plain, also offers an awesome soy sauce version. The thick and sweet gravy is poured over the chopped chicken before serving with chicken rice. The rice is slightly oily and very fragrant (which is how chicken rice should be). It's so good that you can just eat it on its own.This restaurant is also highly recommended if you are looking for a nostalgic taste from the 1960s. The restaurant began as a food stall in the old Toa Payoh Lorong 4 food centre in 1966 before moving to its current location.",
