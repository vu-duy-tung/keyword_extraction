    "text": "Really nice shop on Bencoolen near Middle road with quite a following of young office workers at lunchtime. I was lucky enough to snag a small table indoors on this hot steamy Friday. \u00a0Alfresco is an option. \u00a0 I was able to walk here from the Intercontinental hotel in 10 mins tops. \u00a0The menu is a mixture of Thai, Chinese and Japanese. \u00a0The lunch special was a crazy 6.90 Sing (about 4.90 usd today) and most of the young office workers seemed to be doing just that. \u00a0I had too much of an appetite for only that today, so \u00a0I ordered off the ala carte menu where there were plenty of veg options for yours truly. I selected kai lan with garlic sauce, black olive fried rice and tofu with bean sprouts which was just enough. \u00a0I didn't find any of the options crazy spicy (like Thai Express!) and the olive rice might even be described as plain tasting albeit delicious. \u00a0Next time I'll add some chili and soy sauce me thinks.In any event the entire bill came to 24 Sing including my lime juice. A very nice bargain all in all. \u00a0I'd say a non-ravenous couple could eat here for well under what I paid for my massive lunch samplings. I asked the owner how long she had been in business there and she indicated 5 years. I'll be back. --Enjoy",

Pad thai came in a smaller-than-expected serving so if you like more pad thai, order it in the larger size ($9.90) instead of the small size ($6.90). The broccoli was well cooked too. This place probably does well because of all the NAFA students about.",

It's more or less what I'd expect from a thai shop in a food court, and not much more. A pretty decent thai iced tea though!",

    "text": "Met up with some mates for dinner and one of them suggested a Thai place at Sunshine Plaza but unfortunately it was packed! So we searched for alternatives along the same aisle and chanced upon Zenso. It has a rather dim ambience so we thought it could be a nice cozy dinner hangout. The restaurant serves Thai and Japanese food. We went straight for the Thai menu since we've been craving it. Was too hungry to look at the menu in detail, we decided to go with the set meal for 4. It came with olive rice, kang kong, sweet & sour fish, beef thai salad, tom yum soup, thai iced tea and mango rice pudding. You have two choices for each 'course' of dishes, you can pick one - those I've listed were our choices - other choices include pineapple rice, prawn salad, lemongrass tea, etc...This set that serves 4 people costs $45.80.The food was nothing to shout about but we were starving so I guessed at first bite, everyone whispered some token praises but once the meal was complete, we realized we've had better thai food elsewhere and if we compared it to the standard thai fare like Thai Express - we all agreed that we'd much preferred Thai Express!The positives: The beef salad was pretty refreshing, The Thai Iced Tea was delicious except there was too much ice! There was no service charge or GST which was pretty awesome.The negatives: They served us the rice last. All the dishes were on the table and we were kinda twiddling our fingers in hunger waiting for the main dish - THE RICE!Food portion for 4 people could be bigger. The dessert portion was very measly, a little stingy on the coconut sauce, we asked for a top-up!Final verdict: Zenso is not so zen after all....",

    "text": "Zenso is a quaint shop at Sunshine Plaza that serves Thai-Japanese cuisine. They offer both Thai and Japanese food and not a fusion of the 2, which would be interesting. Zenso serves Japanese Bento sets and Thai dishes like Tom Yum Soup, Green Mango Salad, Green Curry and Mango Sticky Rice. I only stumbled upon Zenso because the other eateries nearby were too crowded. Looking through the menu, I found the dishes really affordable and decided to give it a try. I ordered the Tori Teriyaki Rice Bento, which is grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce. The Rice Bento came with Japanese rice, teriyaki chicken, coleslaw and fruits. For $6.90, that was pretty worth it. There was nothing special about the chicken though, and it was even slightly dry. I could not finish the rice because there was no sauce and it tasted too plain. I doubt I would return again, although the food here is cheap. There are better eateries around that would grant more satisfaction.",
