Got here right after they opened. And by the time we left, it was packed! \u00a0Service was good, quick. And attentive.... I would definitely go back!",

The salad bar is really extensive and there are so many food. Please do not take too many salad bar and wait for the meat to come. The meat would be serve first round, all kinds of meat and following they would come slowly to let you eat slowly. There are just so many meat that I could not describe all but please do try their duck confetti, chicken knuckle, beef chunk and most importantly the grilled pineapple! For the price you are paying the meat are all exclusive and really hard to find in Singapore yet you are able to taste it here. Recommended!",

    "text": "First time here but not new to the 'churrasco experience'This place definitely rivals Brazilian steak houses in the US and other countries we've visited. What really took it to the next level was the superb customer service. Granted service is amazing all throughout Singapore but these guys really take the cake. My husband and I were a bit apprehensive to try some of the meats like chicken hearts but the staff genuinely wanted us to sample a little bit of everything. We were unsure at first but we did try some and to our surprise it was actually pretty tasty. All of the meats are cooked perfectly. I like my meat medium but they had several that were medium rare but so good! Suggestions:- Go hungry- Do get items from the salad bar but not too much - Try a little bit of everything - you just might like it :).",

So the very fact that the restaurant still packs the house to this day is testimony to something. We were a party of 9 tonight and the meats just came by swift and furious. They are certainly not stingy with their cuts and the servers will often joke with us diners here and again, which really makes the dining experience great.They have many different servings of meat and I enjoyed 90% of all served! I love how the grilling brought out the natural taste of the meats. Each of us had our personal favourite cuts so I'm confident to say you can definitely find something you will go gaga over. I, personally' enjoy \"Top Side\" slices very much. And I forgot to mention that they have a salad bar that features about 20 items of delectable vegetables and pasta too!!! I loved their coleslaw and caramelised onions most! I could easily make a meal out of JUST the salad bar! But it's was a really tough choice to decide between more meat or more vegetables? So I just ate more BOTH!I had to roll out of the restaurant after the wonderful meal! Will definitely go back!",

    "text": "Authentic and overall good value for money for S$47++, but you gotta pace yourself. 4-stars relative to other places in Singapore, but in all honesty, not that great and 2-3 stars if compared to other places outside the country.The cuts of meat in Brazil do not correspond directly to the ones you are familiar with. (i.e. the dotted lines on the cow are drawn differently). The picanha (aka top sirloin cap) is the most prized of Brazilian meat cuts, and that's the one cut that is done decently here, so you should grab more pieces when the passador brings it around to the table. Choose a piece that's slightly rarer.The meat cuts are of slightly lower quality, they lack flavour and are sometimes way overcooked and dry. I couldn't tell if they were using a real wood fire or gas. Exotic stuff like chicken liver and chicken hearts are also served, which I appreciated. There were other items like lamb, grilled pineapple (abacaxi), sausages. They also had other non-brazilian offerings like roast duck (?!). The cheese bread (pao de queijo) was also average-tasting and were not spherical. They looked like they were baked in a cupcake pan.Service however, is very good and attentive. Your plates are changed quickly, and some of the waiters are actually Brazilian.I've eaten at other churrascarias around the United States and also some of the good places in Sao Paulo and Rio. In comparison, this place stacks up as 2 to 3-stars compared to other churrascarias outside the country. But there are very few players in this space in Singapore, so this will have to do.",

The salad bar is pretty extensive, but it always takes me so much self discipline not to take too much in preparation for the meaty meal to come. This place serves up a buffet, except that the servers come to your table with the meat and cuts you a slice if you want. I love love the beef, fish and the pineapple. The Bahia Cooler here is the best. Must order! And definitely make a reservation!",

I made the embarrassing decision to get everything which only resulted in a sheepish request for a fresh plate to replace my overflowing one. Food wastage is never a good thing! Especially when every single meat was delicious. Service is quick, efficient and all round excellent with super attentive staff. My lazy bum self was delighted that you didn't even need to move from your seat after the initial trip to the salad bar. Waiters would come round continuously with various meats kebab style, and slice it straight onto your plates. Must try dishes would be their rump beef, smoked duck, and BBQ-ed pineapple. Try asking for the burnt portions - its warm, sweet with the charcoal fragrance locked in it, really unexpectedly yummy! $47++ per person for a Saturday night dinner, reservations are encouraged!",

    "text": "This is a replacement review for one that mysteriously disappeared.This is a review of a large (30+) team dinner that I hosted at Brazil Churrasco.The staff was very friendly and helpful. \u00a0Most importantly though, they kept the meat and drinks coming our way.First, as with most Brazilian steakhouses, this place is about meat. \u00a0Lots of meat and lots of different kinds of meat. \u00a0There is a salad/food bar but make no mistake about it, you go to Brazil Churassco to load up on proteins, beef, pork, lamb, chicken, duck, etc.. \u00a0The meat was cooked well. \u00a0They use a lot of seasonings and there some great flavours along the way. \u00a0This is no place for a vegetarian.There was a steady flow of different meats and the team was up to the task. \u00a0As with most of these, some of the better, more exotic, expensive meats come later in the process. \u00a0So, if your appetite is a bit light, you might want to hold off on some of the earlier rounds.I do think it is a great experience for a larger group. \u00a0It is fun (and sometimes surprising) to see who can keep going and who drops out along the way.Overall - This was a fun dining experience. \u00a0I would certainly go again. \u00a0But I would want it to be another group event. \u00a0If you need a place for a party (and there will be no vegetarians), I suggest giving Brazil Churassco a shot. \u00a0 You will be well fed and I think you will have a great time(ps - this is one of the few reviews i will post without photos.)",

It's in the 'hood, which means the service is warm, welcoming and you feel like you're family2. The meats are top notch - you'll never feel shortchanged at the quality of the cuts3. Lovely fresh salad bar items to help you get over meat guilt4. Potent cocktails5. The just-right rhythm of the buffet as the passadors come to your table bearing skewers of meatBrazil Churrasco has been delighting customers since 1994; I remember heading there as a JC student in 1996 as a treat for the end of exams. Dining back there just a couple weeks ago, I have to commend them on keeping standards high. The restaurant decor is homey, not tired or slick, just a nice shade of comfortable, and the cuts range from beef hump to rump to ribeye, as well as chicken, fish, ham, lamb and more. At $46 all you can eat, the price is right for a monthly red meat treat that rivals some of the steak restaurants in town.",

This place dish out meats, meats and more meats. This is a typical churrascaria restaurant where the Passadores (the meat servers) \u00a0would bring around skewkers of BBQ meats and walk around the restaurants dishing out the meats on the diner's plate. \u00a0They served a rather expensive range of bbq items such as beef topside, beep rump, tenderloin, ham, chicken hearts, livers, lamb, smoked duck, pineapple, sausages, fish and much more. \u00a0It also have a salad station for those looking for some fibre to accompany the meaty meal. \u00a0Personally, I love the beef topside, rump, lamb and smoked duck.Comparative to other churrascaria in Singapore, I prefer the variety and quality of meats here. Oh yes, and I love the mini cheese buns that serve prior to the start of dinner. \u00a0Oh yes. Don't forget to order a glass of refreshing caipirinha to accompany the meal.",
