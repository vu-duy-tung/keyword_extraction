    "text": "Dempsey, an area obviously developed without any consideration for the needs of those without cars, has an uppity vibe that I'm not fond of. Which is why the interior of Samy's - well ventilated and unpretentious - came as a surprise. A quick scan of the menu revealed that prices were reasonable, so that gave us free rein to do that overordering thing. The two of us opted for briyani over white rice (duh), one fish head curry turned into three protein-based dishes, and of course we had to get a coconut each to quell the spicy.Briyani Rice, $3.60 - The chickpea-laden basmati rice, tinted yellow and orange with saffron, was fluffy and smelt of star anise and lemongrass. It was good, especially with the creamy dal and lightly spiced fried potatoes, but just shy of brilliant. Still, I was glad I had it on hand to combat the eye-watering spiciness of the fish head curry.Fish Head Curry, $20.00 for a small portion - A concoction of chilli powder, tamarind, mustard seeds and other spices, the spiciness of this powdery curry was of the eye-watering, airway-clogging variety. Tomatoes were used for thickening the consistency of the gravy and gave it a slight tang. The curry also contained hints of the sweetness of angkoli (the colloquial term in this region for red snapper) used.As the dish was served steaming hot and the curry had numbed my tongue, I wasn't sure how the fish actually tasted at first. Having been cooked together with the curry, the fish head here was less tender than what one would find in a typical Chinese fish head curry, where the fish head is steamed first before ladling the curry on top. It was only when the curry had cooled down to near-room temperature that we detected a slightly fishy odour when eating the flesh, which indicated that the angkoli used here wasn't all that fresh.Mysore Mutton (dry), $10 for small portion - Although it shouldn't be a good thing, we were quite relieved when the serving of Mysore mutton turned out to be tiny. Our opinions on this dish were divided. My friend complained that the mutton was dry and tough. I have to agree that the meat could be more tender, but I really enjoyed the aromatic dry curry paste that the mutton had been cloaked in. Consisting of mutton stock fried with (what else but) a whole load of spices and herbs, including powdered turmeric, coriander, fenugreek seeds, cardamom and chilli, the marinade was intense and permeated the mutton thoroughly, and the meat bore no trace of its signature gamey smell. Now I'm curious to try the wet version of this dish - perhaps that would solve the dryness problem?Masala Chicken, $5.00 a piece - What we could agree on was that the masala chicken here was outstanding. Marinated with - you guessed it - too many spices to list, the chicken here was moist and flavourful. There were notes of paprika, garlic, ginger, tomato, cumin, and curry leaves. Flavourful might be putting it lightly; this was a flavour-bomb and an absolute marvel. We threw caution (along with our distended bellies) to the wind and scraped all the meat off the bones.Judging from the numerous tourists we saw in the restaurant, Samy's Curry is the place to go if you're looking to give your foreign friends a 101 on Indian cuisine. Service is quick without being brusque, and the food's above average. You can pop by one of the neighbouring establishments for after-meal drinks as well.",

The three of us show up SO excited to try fish head curry. I should say this was our first banana leaf meal so we didn't totally know how it worked. One of the servers came over to help us order at the front. We said we have never done this before, needed help figuring it out, but that was mainly just wanted fish head curry and \"didn't want to spend $100 or something\". That was an exact quote. Remember that. So he says something like ohhh well there are three of you so you should get this and this, and maybe two of these, they are very small.... and he keeps going on and on and we are like no no no we don't need all of that! Etc etc. Well we sit down and he proceeds to bring enough food for 100 people. The normal dishes of rice, daal, and veggies came automatcally with the banana leaf, but then two orders of chicken curry followed, with multiple orders of chicken masala, tandoori prawns, chicken korma and finally the ENORMOUS CAULDRON OF FISH HEAD CURRY. Don't get me wrong, every item tasted incredibly good. Like, one of the best indian meals I've ever had. But we specifically said no we didn't want all of that food, we wanted the curry and maybe one other thing whatever was enough for 3 people (ps the fish head curry is easily enough for 10 people alone, so they could have just said that the curry would be enough plus though free sides that come automatically). So we felt bad getting angry at him, and though well maybe it's not that expensive anyway (no prices were displayed anywhere). We get our bill and it's over $100 and we freak out. Normally I wouldn't care but since we were on a trip and had a set budget, it was a big deal. We tried to explain to the people who worked there that this was a mistake but they didn't understand what we were saying. Our server suddenly didn't speak english anymore when we tried to reason with him. I only blame the server. I'm sure the business is lovely and the owners are wonderful, we know the food is incredible. So it's all Raman's fault. That's his name in case you see him and want to avoid him at all costs. Sorry guy, this was such a bitchy review but it was such a sad experience.PS For the record, if you go with a few people, stick with one order of fish head curry for SD $27. It is a good value, and it's worth a trip. But seriously just make sure this is all you order. You will still get the banana leaf with rice, daal, and vegetables.",

Once you step in, they automatically place a banana leaf in front of you as your plate and you have a choice between biryani or white rice. It's especially nice in this day and age to be eating from a banana leaf, which so many Indian restaurants do not do anymore. It really adds that certain authenticity and light fragrance to your meal. You can then choose your curries and dishes from a display at the corner. The butter chicken was average, but the standouts were the chicken tikka and masala chicken. Really wanted to try their specialty, the crab, but with just one other dining companion, it was not worth getting.",

As stated the chicken masala is their signature dish and was prepared well.The only thing is that the Mango lassi tasted a bit artificial and different but rest was great.

Samy's offers various curries with the fish head curry being a winner with most. Rice is served over a banana leaf and that makes the meal a whole lot tastier. Don't ask me why, I don't know either but the food just seems to taste better that way. Rice along with a side of vegetable and potato curry is refillable so eat however much you like. It does gets a little warm with all the spicy food but perspiring is all part of the dining experience! Get an ice cold home-made lime juice to go with your meal!",

    "text": "We were promised a stomping hot curry in a tropical island setting. AJ & I were picked up from T3 Changi in Mercedes GL250 4wd. Our friend H drove us to Dempsey in german stealth metal coach. The contrast on stepping into the control chaos of Samy's curry was monsoonal. Heaps of crowded tables laden with banana leaf plates heaped with rice & curry. We had chicken masala with white rice. Fish patties and lovely fish curry sauce. Washed down with Samy's lime juice. AJ from India had extra. A taste different from India's. The papadums were wafers of South Asia in concentrate. We saw lawyers in black & white enjoying the fish head. Maybe another time as we were discussing astrological economics with H. So couldn't let our senses be clouded by spice and chilly.",

The night I went was busy so unfortunately we had to dine without the leisure of air conditioning. As for the food- naan was great, difficult to mess that up. They also brought us little chips and came around with a giant serving bowl of rice and curry. The curry that I ordered was around S$10, but they gave me a bowl smaller than my hand. I would come back again, but I wouldn't say this is my first choice when I'm feeling like Indian food.",

Although it isn't the fanciest spot to bring a hot date, the proprietors have don't a lot in making sure the place is clean while having efficient service. They're a fish head curry restaurant, but whatever you do, don't order the fish head curry. I'm a simple man with simple needs, so I only order the Masala Chicken, a potato & fish puff (begedil), and the occasional vegetable curry. Pair that with briyani rice and the million free sides they give you, and you're set for the night. If you're looking to cool down, they have huge pints of lime juice or fresh coconuts available.",

Perhaps due to the fact they were one of the first tenants in Dempsey, there is no pressure for them to renovate.The food is really good, the curries all have a strong kick and you know it is freshly made. I find dining on the banana leaves quite appetizing as it just adds to the visual attractiveness of the meal",

The Guidebook however was citing Samy's as an old simple indian restaurant, with cheap but good food.And that's indeed what I found :-)The place is a little bit less visible than most restaurants in the area, but has a small terrace and a huge indoor place, with lots of long tables and a few round tables.You enter, and a waiter takes you through the menu (most is already prepared and ready to be put on a plate for you) A huge choice available, also including crabs and others.Service is very quick and efficient. A big leaf is put in front of you, and you are being served what you ordered on this leaf, and waiters come and offer you different vegetables, curry sauces for the rice, nan bread, etc... My tip: add the pumpkin :-)",

But a 4-star review, possibly even 5, would be based on my dining experience last year and unfortunately my experience last week just didn't compare. Despite the restaurant being only half full, we were seated by the toilets... and despite asking to move inside, we were dissuaded from doing so (apparently booked out? Hmmm I'm unconvinced).Okay then. The good... the tandoori chicken, the potato-fish cake, and the beef vindaloo. \u00a0The roe and baked fish so-so. The fish-head was better than Muthus, I'll grant it that. Once again, my bug bear. Luke warm dishes. How is it so hard to get steaming hot food?! I thought service was as luke warm as the food. I dunno, just wasn't wowed this time. Maybe my expectations were too high, but unfortunately the food just didn't live up to the memory. I would go back, just wouldn't go out of my way.",
