The food is delicious, service excellent, and the surroundings very clean and pleasant. \u00a0To top off a wonderful brunch experience, when we were leaving the lovely lady behind the counter insisted we take a bag of baked delights with us \"to enjoy during the rest your day\"...how nice is that?!?",

I had a hard time choosing and in the end went for a savoury croissant: a salted egg croissant, and a caf\u00e9 au lait.Hearing the accent from the gentleman who served me I spoke French to him, which was great not having spoken it for some time. Also it proved the quality control for originality of the produce being in place :-)I could sense his hesitation regarding my croissant choice and offered a regular one instead but I needed to try the salted egg one and am glad I did.It arrived warm at my table and was just like a croissant should be, very buttery and crunchy, with a great cheese & egg sauce filling.The coffee was great, too, by the way :-)I will be back!",

The cakes and pastries are particularly enticing, including the eclairs, paris brest and cream puffs.Chef Frederic apprenticed at Len\u00f4tre Paris and used to teach at Le cordon Bleu, so he definitely knows his stuff. You can see everyone at work at the kitchen at the back of the cafe. The only thing is that portions are small and the great food doesn't come cheap. It's S$15 for a small slice of quiche and S$8 for a tart... So my trips are occasional, when my wallet permits.",

    "text": "Situated in the up & coming Tanjong Katong enclave (stone throw away from Joo Chiat & Katong), this French cafe is a gem!Only discovered it by chance a few months ago and spent a very leisurely Sun Arvo, reading my stuff & having a late brunch. It's a very popular cafe, but as seats are well spaced out, one doesn't feel claustrophobic.Ambience is perfect, with French music playing in the background. What I appreciate most is the room temperature water & cold water (in glass flasks) for patrons to help themselves.Their food is delicious too! They have a bakery attached, and one can see the bakers at work through the full glass wall separating the cafe & the bakery.Nearest MRT is Paya Lebar Station (EW green line). Take a 3-4 min cab ride here or u can take a couple of buses that stop very near to the cafe. Cafe is situated along the main road so it's v convenient. Lots of eateries and cafes in this stretch, so u can go cafe/eatery hopping once u want a change of scenery.",

    "text": "The Tartiflette \"Reblochon\" $16 (Oven baked Cheese, Potatoes, Bacon) was one of the ala carte dishes that melted my heart instantly. I could slowly savour the cheesy goodness as the pud remained in a semi-liquid form right to the very final lick. The baked baked escargots $16 here are good too. Plump, tender and fresh, these are unlike their frozen limpid counterparts served at other places in Singapore. Other French bistro favourites include the Broken Egg (Plain $12/Cream Bacon $15 /Tomato) that is served with Mouilllettes aka toasts soldiers. I doubt anyone will have a problem clearing the assorted bread basket as the bread is truly a mark of the chef's expertise. It would be foolish not to grab some of the excellent sweets here as well. I highly recommend the macarons that were in a supreme class of its own. The light delicate shells crackle as one bites into it and next comes the moment when the mouth is pleasantly violated with the luscious fillings. I am obsessed with the Peanut Butter Caramel, which tastes like a royal marriage of Snickers bar and Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter. The Coconut is also unbelievably fragrant and divine. Same goes for the dark potent Chocolate. At $2 per piece/$6 per pack, I must confessed that these are definitely a steal and perhaps more enjoyable than the ones from Patisserie G and even Laduree. Another must-try is the Cream Puff ($5). Or more precisely, a chouquette puff that looks deceivingly small but sublimely overloaded with almost unsweetened vanilla cream filling. Unmasked by the sugar, this is one rare moment when I could really taste the pure flavors of the dairy.",

Classic baguette - yummy and crusty. Loaves with cheese or pancetta, olives - how to not love! And did I mention quiches too?If you decide to drop in for a sit down brunch, they also serve up a variety of brunch dishes like croque Monsieur. You can also get them to heat up any other pastries like we love our pain Au chocolat lightly roasted.Took one star off as the pricing is on the high side. But that isn't stopping me from returning since it is right in the hood!",
