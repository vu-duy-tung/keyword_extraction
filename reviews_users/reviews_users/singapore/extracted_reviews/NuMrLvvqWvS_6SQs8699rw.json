    "text": "Believe it or not, I like Sandwich Saigon's dry noodle dishes better than their banh mi!I've tried their banh mi a few times and I always felt the bread was either too crispy or the baguette too small. I was also a bit miffed that you have to pay $1 extra for pate. I think it should be automatically included in every sandwich!My favorite dish so far is their noodle with pork chop. It's a generous bowl full of rice noodles, veggies, herbs, dried garlic, crispy egg roll, and of course, tasty pork chop. Drench it in the sauce they give you on the side and you've got a winner.Their drip coffee is also a good addition, and it truly is a drip coffee as they serve it to you as it drips through the filter! Milk comes on the side so you can have it your way.Maybe it doesn't live up to its name, but at least it's a solid Viet spot in my book. I'll be back.",

However, I wished they served the bean sprouts and veggies on the side so we could \"control\" how much we wanted because what was left in our soup was a whole lot of bean sprouts... ahahaTofu and mushroom banh mi:I felt like it was missing that \"banh mi taste\". I can't describe the taste but I felt like it was missing something. But, the baguette was fresh and it was stuffed with lots of veggiesPortion:The serving size was quite big, it left us feeling stuffed, especially the soup dishes! They also weren't stingy with the fillings in the banh mi which was nice. Service:Can't really say much for it was self-service - the only face to face conversation i had was with the cashier.Price:A little bit pricey for a place in katong. If i can remember correctly,Pho bo - $13Pho ga - $10Tofu and mushroom banh mi - $8Overall, this experience was alright. Definitely a place to go to if you feel like vietnamese. ahahaNothing can beat Long Phung Vietnamese restaurant at Joo Chiat though!",

I'll definitely head back again to give the other items on the menu a try. i think i may just like this place better than nam nam.",

They bake the baguettes themselves--fresh every morning!I usually order the meatball baguette (No. 3) with p\u00e2t\u00e9 ($0.90). The p\u00e2t\u00e9 is from chicken, I think. It's a bit lighter in color and isn't as rich and robust as I like. Perhaps this p\u00e2t\u00e9 doesn't contain liver? But, p\u00e2t\u00e9 is still p\u00e2t\u00e9 and still a love! The meatballs are soft and aren't at all like Italian meatballs. It's more like soft grounded pork...juicy and fatty! My biggest problem now is deciding to eat here or 328 Katong Laksa...decisions, decisions!",

The caf\u00e9 has a very French caf\u00e9 look, and I liked the d\u00e9cor.We were attended to by very friendly wait staff. I looked through the menu and found that they served quite a wide variety of Vietnamese food, including my favorite pho. However, since we were here just to have a light meal, we decided to go for the sandwiches. I ordered the Saigon special sandwich, which was absolutely delicious. The bread was extremely crisp outside (as any good French bread should be), and the inside was fluffy and airy (if that's the right way to describe it). Really amazing.My friends had other stuff such as the spring rolls, which they enjoyed quite a lot as well. Overall, this is a great place to enjoy some very nice Vietnamese food in a very relaxed setting.",

And visiting Sandwich Saigon does bring some memories back. Back in uni days, I always got the sandwiches as they were more convenient to sneak into lectures and munch on. I must say, the pork meatball sandwich I had is equally as amazing as the ones I had in Canberra. There are other sandwiches to choose from and some rice-noodle dishes which I've yet to try, but if you're looking for good sandwiches with a little Vietnamese kick, then this is one place you should check out.",

It sells Vietnamese sandwiches which are French influenced.The bread is the main thing that people go there for. It is so delicious as it is crispy on the outside yet fluffy and chewy on the inside, a combination hard to find. They have other foods like their popiah and noodles, they even sell the popiah skin there.Service was good but it was a tiny shop after all, sometimes might have to take awhile to find seats. I am definitely going back for more food if i was craving for Vietnamese cuisine.",

They specialize in a small selection of Vietnamese Baguettes as well as a couple of broken rice dishes. The dining room looks as though it was set up with 5 minutes of thought and 50 bucks worth of Ikea furniture. Though who cares!!! If you've ever eaten a Vietnamese baguette from a road side stall in Saigon, then this is luxury!!! A set menu of a drink plus a food item will set you back around $10, which in comparison to Vietnam, is freakin expensive.... Though, for the standard and variety of Vietnamese food in Singapore, it is actually really solid and authentic. The family that run this caf\u00e9 also give you that family run, homely charm to their service, always happy to have a chat and recommend something new for you to try. \u00a0Highly recommend if your passing by the area.",
