    "text": "\"Nailed it,\" I said no less than four times during my meal tonight at La Strada. Every thing about this place begs me to come back for more. Hands down my favorite Italian fare in SG. Go here, and thank me later. This restaurant is worth every dime. Sweet, fresh, fragrant and balanced bruschetta. \u00a0Tender and responsive gnocchi. Healthy, juicy and succulent pork chop. Best of all, the bolognese is the best I have had since eating the mindblowingly amazing bolognese of Osteria dell'Orsa in Bologna, Italy, itself. I will come back here again and again. The non-pretentious osteria-style decor and home cooked quality food will invite me back with open arms every time.",

He didn't even say that maybe 30 minutes. I think they were lazy to work, I don't know about the food but the quality of service was definitely very very poor. \u00a0I would not give even one star.",

Came here for dinner, but their set lunch menu does look very affordable, and value for money. Had the squid ink risotto with scallops (typically only on the lunch menu but they acceded to my special request), and they were extremely generous with the squid ink sauce, the scallops were well cooked (not too dry). The fianc\u00e9 had the lobster risotto which he polished off really quickly! The seaweed made the rice extremely tasty. It is a little pricy but it really was worth it! The service was excellent as well; the waitresses were really attentive.",

Same owners as next doors Aoki and Le Amis, this place is somewhere you can get a great tasting appetizer, flavorful main course dish, order a reasonable priced bottle of wine and relax. Highly recommend their Vongole as a starter and their lobster spaghetti as a main course. Not sure if they still have their spinner crab pasta but if they do, get that.Get a nice Amarone with those courses and you are set for the night.Service is great, very friendly staff.Not the best or freshest Italian in the area but definitely recommend for a good night out.",

I was able to snag a reserved table even though I didn't have a reservation because I went at 6:30pm and they didn't need the table until 8:30pm. If you go after 7pm, make a reservation because they were turning people away at the door. I settled on the braised oxtail ($36). This was very delicious and someone put a lot of love into this dish with the teeny tiny carrots cut up and the amount of thyme. However, for me, it ended up being more of an appetizer portion (I was hungry - Piggy Power was in effect) and it needed some mashed potatoes or more bread to sop up the gravy. I ended up ordering the beef and pork ragout gnocchi ($28) and that was phenomenal. Just pillows of gnocchi covered in the delicious ragout. I want more! I had a glass of Barbera ($15) to wash it down. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "They offer an appetiser + main course + dessert 3 course lunch for $35. You add extra for special orders. Went with my family so we all ordered a variety of dishes to share. Overall, the food wasn't that impressive and I'm on the fence about whether I'd return. If I do, it'd mostly be for the ambience and service.AMBIENCE - 5 starsCute and cosy. My kind of place.SERVICE - 4 starsGreat! They were accommodating in allowing us to top up to change the dessert to the dessert of the day (cannoli). They ran out of pistachio gelato which accompanied the cannoli, didn't inform us and simply swopped it with vanilla ice cream. I don't quite like ice cream so the waiter kindly gave us a complimentary scoop of yoghurt gelato, which was delicious.APPETISERBurrata (+$4) - with applewood smoked salmon - 4 starsMy favourite starter. Comes with a huge ball of burrata so definitely share this. I really liked the salmon, which didn't taste fishy at all.Capesante (+$3) - seared scallops - 2 starsSkip this. The scallops are rubbery.Indivia - endive salad - 3 starsSimple, good saladMAINPollo - chicken stewMy sister liked this so much I didn't get to try any!Tacchino - breaded turkey breast stuffed with fontina cheese - 2.5 starsDidn't quite enjoy this. I suppose it's what you might expect of the dish, and it was too rich and heavy for me. The brussels sprouts were over-salted.Risotto (+$3) - squid ink risotto with scallops - 2.5 starsAgain, I thought the scallops were rubbery. The risotto was alright, but I'm not a fan of risotto.DESSERTYoghurt gelato - 4 starsMy favourite dessert. Refreshing tangy taste.Limoncello tiramisu (+$3) - 3.5 starsA nice twist on a traditional dessert. But too much cream for me.Pera (+$4) - 3 stars - poached pear, red wine, vanilla ice creamNothing special.Cannoli with pistachio gelato - 2.5 starsThey ran out of pistachio gelato. The cannoli itself was soft and nothing special - I don't usually enjoy it and this dish didn't change my mind.COFFEE/TEAThey serve Clipper tea, and can do cappuccinos/lattes with skim milk, which was a nice bonus. No soy milk.",

    "text": "Nice little gem located at Scott's Road just right next to shaw center. Love the food there - we ordered a set lunch which consist of an appetizer, main and dessert.The appetizers we ordered were: beef carpaccio with truffle dressing and burrata. First of all, the truffle dressing for the carpaccio was good topped with a very distinct taste of the truffle dressing. The burrata has got to be my favorite. It has an excellent buffalo mozzarella - thick and creamy, followed by the amazing taste of the salmon on the side. It was a great combo between the two, accompanied by breadsticks. For the main I ordered risotto in squid ink with scallops. The risotto was up to par. But I preferred more of what my boyfriend ordered which was spaghetti carbonara: with truffle butter, egg confit and bacon crumble. It was delish. The dish was overall very creamy and buttery, with a strong kick of the truffle taste. It was a pretty small serving for this one, I guess becoz it was rich and creamy. Oh, and it was topped with an egg and it was just excellent! Must come back!",

For the main course the manager helped coach me through some options. I'm a fan of veal saltimboca whenever I can get it. It was interesting, and very good (amazing how different it is prepared nearly every time I try it, but rarely disappoints). But the custom side pasta was out of this world. Just some linguine in olive oil and white wine sauce with garlic and a touch of hot pepper. Fantastic. Can't wait to come back again. So much more menu exploration to do. Only downside was price.
