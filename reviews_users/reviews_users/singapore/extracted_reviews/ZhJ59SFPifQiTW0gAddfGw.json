    "text": "After watching his tv show and adventures in the US, I came to Jamie's Italian with high expectations. I like Jamie from what I know him - a down- to-earth and accessible cook.So it all started on the Saturday between Good Friday and Easter. Came by for a late dinner and we were promptly seated. We started with appetizer special bruschetta and posh fries. The tomatoes on the Ciabatta bread just tasted perfect with the cheese and herbs applied.We then ordered a selections of pastas and risotto, and shared a rump steak. My favorite was the wild mushroom risotto though I usually don't eat risotto. It was light on the taste buds and almost flawless. The spinach ravioli was just okay though the serving could have been larger. Jools tuna pasta, in contrast, came in a large serving. Not too sure why it was recommended as a favorite - \u00a0it tasted just normal. The squid ink pasta I personally ordered was fairly disappointing. It was dry and garlicky. I prefer squid ink pasta that is drenched in black sauce that leaves your mouth black after eating it. No comments on the rump steak.Desserts included the lemon meringue and tiramisu. The former had a crispy crust which was nice but I felt the lemon taste to be a little overpowering; the latter had a fairly strong alcoholic taste and though the slice was a little small, I found it delicious. I see myself coming back for the planks and other mains like the veal coupled with a glass of red wine.",

    "text": "Disappointing. \u00a0Avoid. \u00a0We were fooled by the Jamie Olivier brand, and would not return. \u00a0We had a large party. Dinner came out to be about $600, for the size of our group, I'd say it was reasonable. Service was a huge problem and big factor in botching the meal. \u00a0We ordered family style and dishes routinely came out 1 by 1 (even when we made multiple orders of the same plate). This bothered me a lot. It set a lousy tone as there was never enough food to go around, and dishes got cold as we waited for for more food to arrive. Piece meal delivery of dishes is not what a large party wants. \u00a0Additionally, we were incorrectly served dishes from other tables, and the way they were taken away from our table that was awkward and gauche.The waitstaff is nice enough though. \u00a0Our main waiter was kind, and tried to be attentive. \u00a0But the training and management at the restaurant is inept, \u00a0and you see that clearly when you have a large party. \u00a0Sadly, the food did not make up for this.We sampled most of appetizer list, most of the pastas, and for the meats we had the pork chop and lamb chops. \u00a0 My girlfriend enjoyed the salads and thought they were the best part of the meal (which says a lot when you really consider it). I thought the meat dishes were nice, however the appetizers apart from the squid were bland (and not particularly healthy either). Most dished came fried yet soggy, and covered in a flavorless tomato sauce. \u00a0The arancini were the best of the sad starter lot. \u00a0The pastas and risottos were also soggy, the pasta very far from from al dente, and under spiced. The truffle risotto had a lumpy, oatmeal like texture which was pathetic. Apart from the lamb chops I'd say nothing we had felt like celebration food. \u00a0I admit I had miscalculated expectations. \u00a0This is a mega restaurant, churning out a couple hundred dinners a night, so the kitchen's priority is speed and not quality. \u00a0Wine was reasonably priced.The desserts could be skipped. You're probably better off bringing something in from Awfully Chocolate or the ABC bakery next door. \u00a0I felt it was ridiculous that a single desert for one diner came first, and we had to wait another 10 minutes for the rest of the deserts to come after. \u00a0The dessert portions are under-sized, and don't share well. In particular I'd say avoid the tiramisu. \u00a0Toward the end of the meal I was further annoyed by the sense of rush. \u00a0We were not asked if we wanted coffee. And the restaurant was aggressively wiping down tables, while the place was still half full. \u00a0 So if you are craving Italian, there are plenty of superior options in Singapore. \u00a0Maybe even in Vivocity. \u00a0 I was snookered by the \"brand\" here and took it for a mark of quality and inventiveness. \u00a0Instead we encountered something close to the opposite. This place is an ill-managed, international chain made best suited for tourists from Universal Studios. If you're the sort that's inclined to do some research before selecting a meal, I'd advise to go on the restaurant's site and look at the menu. \u00a0There aren't too many fireworks on it, and you should take your first impression seriously. \u00a0If you are considering booking a large party, and the quality of the service and food are very important, then you should consider another venue. If you still aren't convinced, walk through the restaurant first. \u00a0It's well decorated and has a good ambiance, but you probably won't be impressed by how the food looks, let alone tastes. \u00a0And if even you are, there's a decent shot the service will still somehow muck up the experience.",

    "text": "Having frequented one of their London branches, I was excited to check out Jamie's Italian in Singapore. Having just opened, it is obvious they are still finding their feet. However, I was pretty pleased with my overall experience. It's not so easy to find an unstuffy, tasty and reasonably priced Italian restaurant in Singapore, and Jamie's Italian fills the void nicely. The d\u00e9cor is tasteful in a rustic kind of way, the menu extensive, and the service earnest. I ordered the meat platter for starter to share and for mains we ordered tuna fusilli and meatballs. The meat platter was decent and came on a nice wooden plank, but mains were more worthwhile. For dessert we had both tiramisu and panna cotta - both were OK, I have had better. The menu itself is extensive with something for everyone, and they have plenty of drinks. They also let you order a carafe of wine, instead of a bottle, which isn't so common in Singapore. The service was good, but quite hectic and a bit rehearsed. You could tell that the servers were freshly trained and were milling about all over the place. The ambience would have improved if the service staff were more relaxed and seamless. I have no doubt Jamie's Italian will be a success in Singapore as they have a crowd pleaser menu. But there is definitely room for improvement!",

Normally I would give 2 or 3 stars, but I would like to see their rating go down compared to restaurants that have 4 stars and actually serve reasonably priced, reliably good Italian food, like Bella Pasta.The seafood bucatini was way overcooked, like the tubes were falling apart. The \"appetizer\" portion of the sausage pasta was more like a sample portion. The rocket and radicchio salad was decent. The glasses of wine were kind of inexpensive and decent. The arancini were kind of dry. The tiramisu was about average for Singapore but odd in that it had very thin layers of sponge cake instead of espresso-soaked lady fingers.For $60+ per person, this should be better.",

I tried tuna fusill while my boyfriend tried linguine vongole and we accompanied our meals with a side - polenta fries. \u00a0 The tuna fusill was lacking in flavour; there were spices and herbs to complement the tomato sauce but the pasta was too starchy such that it overpowered them. The elements of herbs, tomato sauce and tuna felt too singular and individual; I don't know but I like my pasta to be a bursting mouthful of flavours - harminous and layered in taste - but their tuna fusill was really at best subpar, considering you are paying 20-30 SGD for a meal. However, I really enjoyed the polenta fries. Its skin/coating is crispy fried but gooey and chewy inside.",

    "text": "Was super excited when I heard Jamie Oliver was opening a restaurant here, so I made a date with my friend to go and nomz Italian food. I loveeeeeeeeee pasta, just to be clear. Anyway! We ordered a Vegetable plank and a Meat plank as appetizers, and small sizes of pasta - pasta alla norma (I think) and the squid ink pasta.Let me explain why this place has 3 stars. One star for the ambience - FLAWLESS.One star for the service - it was prompt.One star for the meat in the meat plank - My friend said it was \"melt in your mouth/consistency of butter\", which I assume is good from the foodgasm faces she was making. And here's why the place has only 3 stars.1) I ordered the vegetable plank, which consisted of about half an onion and a slice of eggplant and a slice of squash(?). I get that onions are cheap, but when you say 'vegetables' I do NOT expect half an onion. Well, for onion lovers I suppose you'll all run order that dish now. :)2) I'm not a cheese or pasta expert, but I am prettyyyyy sure al dente pasta does not mean hardasballs pasta. Also, I'd like stronger more flavorful cheeses with my Italian food. The bill came to about $60 nett... quite affordable. However, portion size and food quality was not something that made me jump around for joy. Still prefer the Sizzlelinis at Spageddies... sauce is TODIEFOR but that's a whole other review :P",

We came in without reservation on a public holiday at 5+pm. Didn't have to wait long for a table.Archipelago beer is malty. Very smooth and fragrant.The aged steak is fantastic. Loved the flavor. I ordered medium rare, it came slightly more medium than rare. The fries without the truffle butter is nice too, but can be a bit crispier. Next time when I'm back (yes, I'll be back), I'll get the truffle butter.The slow-cooked lasagne is not too cheesy and creamy. The sourish tomato sauce cuts through the richness.We ordered a epic brownie after finishing the main courses. We found the brownie a tad too sweet.Overall, an enjoyable meal.",

    "text": "On the last night of our honeymoon after doing some shopping at Vivo City my wife and I thought we would treat ourselves to a nice final meal in Singapore. We have eaten at Jamie's Italian in Sydney and thought it was exceptional. We arrived right on 7pm and were informed it would be about half an hour wait, however we were able to wait inside, at the bar, happy days. They even had some little chunks of bread and oil / balsamic and thinly sliced bits of ham to nibble on while we waited. We ordered up 2 cocktails (A mojito and Jamie's Italian Singapore sling) both were nice, \u00a0as expected and you could taste the respective alcohol in each, once we knocked those over about 45 minutes had passed so we ordered two more drinks (a Florence Fizz and a large draught beer that is brewed especially for Jamie's Italian in a local Singaporean brewery) then enquired as to how much longer until we would be seated, it was only a couple more minutes and we were escorted to our table, we ended up right under the main air con vent which some people may not have liked but I'm a junkie for air con in Singapore so I was content with it. The waiter took a little while to come and take our order but when he did he was polite and attentive, he did try a sneaky sparkling water sale but we only wanted still water. My wife ordered the main portion of wild mushroom and smoked mozzarella risotto which was light and delicious, a slight criticism was that there was only a small amount of the smoked mozzarella. I had the burger Italiano with some funky fries (pretty sure burger and chips aren't traditional Italian but whatevs) and found it to be, in Jamie's words juicy, pimp and proper rustic yeah. It was big but so is my gob and my appetite so it held together and I enjoyed every bite. We got the bill and for some reason both our credit cards declined which had me concerned but the waiter quickly changed up the machine and it was all good. Phew. If I were to compare this to Jamie's Italian in Sydney I would say while the food was on par the service in the Sydney restaurant is just that little bit slicker, more affordable and the cocktails are more creative (they have a blueberry and basil cocktail which sounds like a strange combo but works a treat).",

I've heard a lot of mixed reviews, makes me wonder what people were expecting. Jamie Oliver isn't exactly cooking in the kitchen.That being said, for what it is, I think the food is GOOD. It absolutely met my expectations. We had the mushrooms and smoked mozzarella to start, that was excellent - though a bit on the salty side, along with a rocket and radicchio salad. I had the truffle risotto because they were out of crab risotto. I love risotto and this one was cooked really well. The rice had bite and the combination of truffle and Parmesan was perfect. Risottos tend to be really heavy but this was surprisingly light. The lemon meringue pie was good - very tangy and a generous helping of meringue, just the way it should be (maybe minus the candied fruit on top). Gotta give a shout out to the house wine as well, it's a good selection that's value for money.",

    "text": "Very disappointed in both our meal and the service. We went on a Sunday evening and they were not busy but frankly seemed as if they had never served a family before. We waited several minutes for baby chairs and several more before anyone stopped by the welcome us with menus or to start the process. When we did see staff, they were somewhat abrupt and not overly friendly. That in itself kind of turned me off even before we got our food. The portions were tiny, overpriced and not exceptional. When the largest plates on the table are the kids meals, you know something is amiss. I had the spinach ravioli. The pasta itself was well cooked but the sauce was watery and there were far too many pine nuts in the sauce. The price worked out to about $4 per ravioli - not worth it for very mediocre food. My wife had the prawn pasta - it was tasty but again, the portion minuscule. Bottom line - overpriced and not much better than run of the mill Italian chains in the U.S. \u00a0Won't be going back to this one. We were with some folks who had been before - they were convinced the portion size had shrunk since their last visit.",

If you think about any of the 'nice' Italian restaurants, it can easily cost more than $150 for 2. For the same price, you can get more food and wine at Jamie's. Good food, and although the service isn't as fancy as the 'nice' Italian restaurants, I like the ambiance -- Italian families are loud and homey -- and that's the ambience Jaime's have.They have a 'weekend plank' where you can pay $160 and get a lot of food, including the famous polenta chips. It's described for 2, but it's enough for 3 -- especially if you have Singaporean appetites. (We have Western appetites, but we were full and couldn't finish the wonderful desserts.)For a la carte, favorites that we always order: green peas and mint, tagliatelle bologanese (a classic), a bruschetta. We've been back to this place many times because for the price you get a lot of good food, and other 'nice' Italian restaurants seem overpriced compared to Jamie's.",

All were tasty and very well presented with a nice range of interesting flavours. Main courses were terribly mediocre though. Not even good- pastas were too salty and not flavourful - and te hamburger was a big letdown for my friend. Saved by nice desserts. It's a pleasant ambience for a weekday lunch, but at $52 per head, there are much much better lunch options. Come once if you must, and leave it behind.",

General consensus after our meal was that everyone enjoyed their dining experience. Appetizers - polenta with freshly grated cheese and topped with fresh rosemary. Yum. A winner tonight was the seasonal bruschetta with ricotta, shaved eggplant ad other goodies. Fresh, crunchy, creamy, nutty. Party time. Mains - having tried small plates and a pasta last time, I had the baked salmon tonight. Nicely done with roasted carrots and beets, with a tasty salad on the side. My boyfriend and M had seafood bucatini which was good. A and E had veal, which they were pleased with. A2 had pasta. Wine - we had a soave white that everyone agreed was good value for money. Dessert - A had tiramisu which he was impressed by...considering he is Italian that is a big compliment to the chef. M and E (both Italian) had panecotta -- they said this was remarkable and I agree, having sneaked a taste. A2 and A3 shared the lemon merengue pie.411A wondered why I keep coming back and shared \"this is honest and good food\". $70/person all inclusive. We will be back.

The restaurant was packed during dinner but we got our table easily as I had made reservation a week again. Although the restaurant looked quite dark at the entrance, we were swiftly showed to a bright looking table overlooking the sea view.For restaurant week, the restaurant was having a sugar and spice menu which cost $38++ for dinner. There were 2 choices for antipasti. Roasted Chilli Pepper Caprese BruschettaToasted ciabatta brushed with garlic, topped with buffalo mozzarella, sweet roasted peppers, cherry tomatoes & fresh basilBeware of the roasted peppers. While juicy, it tasted quite spicy too. The cheese was melted in the mouth.Proper Pumpkin SoupThe creamiest pumpkin soup ever, spiced with fresh nutmeg, with crispy aubergine & natural yogurtIt was a rich creamy sweet soup with a tab minty taste.For Secondi, we selected 2 out of the 3 choices available.Steak Tagliata220g Grilled Ribeye, spiced & cooked al mattone, crunchy fennel salad, wiggly chilli, loadsa herbs, zesty lemon & olive oil.The steak was cooked just nice. Interestingly flavored with the minty and zesty sauce.Our Famous Prawn LinguineFried garlicky prawns, shaved fennel, tomatoes, chilli & rocket.The linguine was soaked up the flavours, topped with juicy prawns.For desserts : Crema Alla VanigliaSweet vanilla cream topped with marshmallow meringue & cinnamon poached pear.It looked so sweet with the flamed touched meringue. It was light and sweet finish to a heavy meal.Hot Chocolate & Chilli FondantFreshly baked oozy chocolate pudding sightly spiced with chilli, with salted caramel ice cream.It was served warm, topped with ice cream. I would prefer it to be served pipping hot with the chocolate lava flowing out. It not hot enough to have the molten chocolate flow. The spicy taste was there but not too bad.On top of the restaurant week menu, we also ordered a number of dishes from the ala carte menu.Chicken Milanese ($28.50++)Free-range chicken stuffed with prosciutto & fontal cheese, breadcrumbed & topped with a free-range egg & truffle oilWhile crispy outside, inside was cheesy creamy and juicy.Parma Pizza ($27.50)It was the special pizza of the day, recommended by the staff. The pizza was light and crispy. Tomato base, topped with parma ham and rocket.Crispy Squid ($23.50++/ large)With garlic & lemon mayo, chilli, parsley & fried garlicIt looked quite small for large serving. It was crispy and chewy.

    "text": "In need of a hearty meal? Then you gotta go Italian, Jamie's Italian. Yes there have been hits and misses (i kinda hate that they keep updating their menu with the new items and removing old ones) but sticking to the long standing faves will satisfy your need for comfort food.If you don't know, Jamie Oliver focuses on using the best ingredients, which are meticulously sourced from producers, both in Italy and around the UK. All their staff are very knowledgeable on the dishes they serve and they are more than happy to share with you the origin of each dish, or how they are prepared and all. Meal time entertainment FTW.On the Cured Meat Plank ($16.50/pax), there's the 18 month aged San Daniele Prosciutto; hot soppressata (Southern Italian dry salami); Mortadella & bresaola; Pecorino & chilli jam on the crunchy music bread; a beautiful selection of Puglia pickles; olives & crunchy salad. All meats are sliced to order ensuring maximum freshness and flavor. If i have to eat pasta, then they better be hand made and fresh! Of course that's expected at Jamie's Italian.Bolognese is something that everyone thinks that they can make but really, it's hard to make a really delicious bolognese. Do not miss this not-so-simple dish of Tagliatelle Bolognese ($14.50)! Jamie's Italian tosses pasta together with beef, pork, red wine and butter and served with pangrattato (crunchy herby breadcrumbs), herbs, garlic, Parmesan and olive oil to give it that lovely umami and dimensions in flavor profile. The sauce is made from sieving the tomatoes (not a paste) and you can taste that freshness in each bite. Plus it's a HUGE plate. So damn good. High grade acquerello rice is used in risottos and we love how it's done in the Wild Mushroom & Smoked Mozzarella Risotto ($26.50). The rice is first cooked with Porcini mushroom stock for that earthy flavor. Parmesan, parsley, pan-fried mixed forest, oyster and Swiss brown mushrooms, as well as torn scamorza (hay smoked mozzarella) are then added to finish off the dish. The result? A super smooth, creamy, and rich plate of tasty carbs. Jamie's Italian VivoCity now also offers pizzas in their refreshed menu. Their pizza dough is made fresh daily from a combination of manitoba (a premium Italian bread flour), yeast and water. The dough is shaped through gentle stretching (not rolling) which is key to developing its crisp texture and crust. It is also served on a special stoneware plate which retains the heat and crispness of the pizzas for longer. Another irresistible carb. \u00a0For desserts, we ended with the Molten Chocolate Praline Pudding ($12.50), a rich chocolate center encased in a light chocolate sponge, served warm with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream and a sprinkle of crunchy praline.No fancy stuff at Jamie's Italian for us. The best things in life are the simple ones.",

I've tried going there twice before without a reservation, only to be told the next slot is 2 hours away. Today, we decided to make a reservation; practically the only way in. Food - I decided to give the crab spaghetti a try. I was more of a linguine girl but crab spaghetti sounded very interesting. My only experience with crab was with sambal, never pasta. I'm sorry to say that it was pretty ..meh. It tastes like crab sambal with cream and pasta. The funky chips were nice, but would have been better if there'd been some dipping sauce. My husband's Arrabiata was pretty good. Pasta was cooked well and sauce was nice and spicy. Service - It was busy (seems they're ALWAYS busy) so we had to get the waiters' attention. Nonetheless, they were friendly and jovial when serving us. Atmosphere - It was pretty hectic with the waiters buzzing around like busy bees, but it wasn't too hard getting their attention. The food took about 20 minutes to arrive, no surprise there. It was pretty congested and noisy, I could barely hear my husband even though we were sitting so close.Maybe I was expecting too much, or maybe the crab spaghetti was just a bad choice of dish.",

I quite enjoyed my meal at Jamie's though I did find it pricy for the portions given. The truffle tagliatelle had good texture and the sauce went perfectly, but it could've used more truffle. Also, the small portion is not enough by itself; if you go that route I recommend ordering one more dish. I went for the bruschetta.The bruschetta was over $10 for one slice of bread. Despite punching my wallet in the face, it did taste pretty good. I was a bit disappointed that it was served 20 minutes after I finished my pasta. The same happened with my friend's salad; not sure who dropped the ball there.The Epic Brownie was delicious, but I didn't get what was epic about it. It was a thick, chocolate brownie topped with amaretto ice cream (that was melting quick) garnished with caramelised amaretti popcorn. Again, good, but epic? That's up for debate.TL;DR- Yummy food, but you'll pay for it. Kitchen/service logistics need improvement!",

    "text": "Striking in the middle between casual and fancy, Jamie's is a nice restaurant frequented by couples and friends. There is a good view of the river near the back of the restaurant so try to get these tables if you can!My friends ordered the Truffle Tagliatelle and Squid Ink Spaghetti. The Truffle Tagliatelle was unimpressive as it was pretty monotonous and with not a lot of excitement going on in the plate. The Squid Ink Spaghetti though up-gamed the experience with its unique pasta and selections of seafood.  To be honest, if I were to have only tried their pasta options, \u00a0this place would be a 3/5 as the portions were small and didn't really justify the $$$. I ordered the Chicken Al Mattone, which was an excellent choice. The chicken came in good portions and was well complemented with arugula, mushrooms and its sauce. I would definitely recommend this dish over the Truffle Tagilatelle in terms of portion and price! Note: Free wifi upon request!",

Although the waiting time of your order will take awhile because of the large crowd and their kitchen began busy, their staff went over to us to inform about the massive order and our order will be delayed a bit. We were so hungry but it's okay, we still hold on to our patience. After that, the food was served and I first tasted the Truffles Tagliatelle and I loveddddd it so much! The serving is quite small and price is so expensive but it tastes sooooo delicious! I loved it especially the Chicken Al Mattone. I'm actually quite satisfied with their food and I think the prices are reasonable. I would recommend this restaurant :)",

    "text": "I came here for dinner on a late Sunday night around 8pm. \u00a0The restaurant didn't look busy. \u00a0Yet, the host told me there was a 60-minutes wait. \u00a0I wasn't pleased but since I was already there I waited... \u00a0(The restaurant is all the way in Vivo City in Harborfront which is very far from my hotel so returning on a different night with a reservation wasn't an option...)While I was waiting, I got even more upset when I saw there were plenty of empty tables and the host wasn't sitting any new parties... \u00a0This is what I would call a lackluster night... \u00a0Perhaps the kitchen was busy putting out orders? \u00a0Regardless, it was almost 9pm at this point. \u00a0So I walked up to the host to check and he actually said he had a table ready for me now. \u00a0(Seriously?)I was brought to a high table near the entrance. \u00a0After another 5 minutes or so, a waitress took me to my table. \u00a0I confirmed what I suspected, the restaurant wasn't busy. \u00a0The waitresses were chit-chatting. \u00a0If this restaurant didn't carry Jamie's name, I might have been more forgiving... but since it did, I was quite unhappy at this point and thought to myself, \"the food better knock my socks off\". \u00a0Sadly, that did not happen.This place isn't exactly cheap in Singapore's standards. \u00a0My dinner cost around S$40. \u00a0The food I ordered was bland and the presentation was just average. \u00a0Even Olive Garden tastes better in my opinion. \u00a0(Now that is just sad.)wild mushroom & smoked mozzarella risotto - I was so distracted by the undercooked risotto (there is a fine difference between undercooked and al dente!) \u00a0I didn't even noticed there was mozzarella. and the smoky part? \u00a0oh, just forget it!polenta chips - of course, what was meant to be an appetizer came after my risotto. \u00a0Again, they were so bland I had to ask for ketchup to roll them in the deep. \u00a0(I know, so wrong...)I know I should give them a second chance but making me wait when I can clearly see empty tables at a restaurant with idle servers were just the ultimate deal breaker. \u00a0If they want to create any kind of illusion of a hip place where everyone has to wait, they have failed miserably. \u00a0The only positive thing I could think of is that they gave me a big bottle of ice water so I don't have to constantly flag my server down for more water.Verdict: \u00a0There are so many dining option in Singapore why do I have to come back and let it disappoint me again?",

    "text": "I think I have watched every single cooking show by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver (counting in the number of reruns on TLC) but never got to try his food because I had flew off to the Land of Rising Sun when he just opened the restaurant at Vivocity. Linguine Vongole ($27.50++) was the special pasta of the day (not on the menu). Tossed with Manila clams, sliced chilli's, tomatoes, parsley and anchovies, this homemade pasta dish was very light on flavour and the sauce was sweet. So light was the pasta that both of us decided to ask for some Parmesan Cheese, which descended like fluffy snow flakes. Oh boy, the cheese made a whole lot of difference to the dish. The Baked Salmon ($23++) was well seasoned and not overly cooked, though the whipped lemon \"risotto\" seemed more like pur\u00e9ed cream without any grainy texture. The desserts were not those gorgeously plated sweets but as casual as the likes of the British chef. My brownie-loving partner who has a penchant for rich dark chocolate, couldn't stop showering her praises for the Epic brownie($11.50) \u00a0after taking a bite. The seductive fudgy dark chocolate is lifted by the hints of boozyness in the amaretto ice cream and accented by crunchy popcorns, making it a rich yet none too cloying treat. Jamie's tiramisu ($11.50) has a clear division of labour between the coffee sponge and sticky mascarpone. It is definitely very robust in the java and little citrusy with the presence of orange shavings, though the overall texture was dry. The savoury dishes did not spark excitement as the desserts did. I was looking for set lunches since we came at 12 noon, but the board at the entrance wrote 3pm-5pm. Strangely, we noted that it became 12pm-5pm as we left the place. Perhaps our eyes were playing tricks on us.",

Managed expectations after reading less than stellar reviews on Yelp.Party of 2, dropped by after the movies on a Saturday evening (around 9.30pm) - it was still 80% occupied. We shared 3 dishes - first dish had to be carb loaded and we chose the Tagliatelle Bologanese. Love that they had two sizes to choose from - starter size and main. The pasta was cooked just nice with a good bite and springy-ness. The meat sauce was generous - a large helping was found hidden under the pasta. Had the 220g Rump Steak as well. Comes with a side of shoe-string fries and yogurt coleslaw. Nothing really special about this dish - it was done the way you'd have expected.The baked mushroom was the best dish. A crispy crust forms just around the dish, very cheesy, mushrooms were succulent (and I thought there was an inkling of truffle smell - though my partner disagreed). Good portion to share around. 3* for now - a good option for food but will not be bothered if there's a queue/ going out of the way.",

    "text": "Just when I thought that the hoo-haa over this restaurant has died down and decided to venture out to try it myself, I realized I was dead wrong.Being silly and wanting to try this place on a Friday night (of all nights), I was happily amazed that there was no queue. Lo and behold, the queue was only to 'log' your reservation and you had to wait for your table. I was dismayed to see that there were plenty of people before me who had queued and were probably shopping around vivocity. Nevertheless, I 'logged' my reservation for 2 as well. We were starving and waited for an hour but didn't receive any text from the place. Hence, we decided to try some place else.Next try, we came on a Monday night and guess what, we only waited 30 mins max!Our food however took quite a long while to come as we saw that diners who came after us had already started their meal. We asked the server to check and the next thing we knew, he brought us an appetizer on the house called \"OUR FAMOUS POLENTA CHIPS\" which was incredible! The chips weren't really chips and it simply melted in your mouth. Perfection achieved!To see if the food was up to expectation, I ordered the ordinary Tagliatelle Bologanise \u00a0(S$22), normal size. Seemed a bit pricey as the portion was small and the food quality was passable to me. Wasn't a WOW that I would expect from the vibe that this place has generated over the past few months. Our appetizer of Fennel & Orange Salad came in a very sad-looking portion. The dish looked so unappetizing that my remark was \"...is this really the kind of thing they would serve here? just a few leaves and orange peel thrown together. Oh Gosh!\" It looked like something I would put together from a 2-star hotel buffet spread. My advice is not to order this dish, there are better appetizers on the menu.We wanted to try the Tiramisu which was apparently their most popular dessert but we were stuffed from dinner and decided on the simple dessert of Affogato. Though simple (Coffee and ice cream), it was perfect in its combination - we thoroughly enjoyed it!I would need some time before I would be willing to try this place again. But next time, I would try the mains!Tip: Come on a Monday night if you want to try this place! Fastest service guaranteed.",

I was told that they could easily fill the indoor space with 230pax while another 50-60pax at the patio (could do more but some tables have been removed to widen up the walk area). I witnessed the opening ritual with all the servers lining up behind the \"concierge spot\"; u will be ushered to an empty seats according to the digital table plan the floor manager uses at the entrance. Jamie dons his first Asia outpost in steel-finishes and wood-pieces, pocketed leather sofa seats along with causal canteen-like movable dining furnitures, modest-looking light fixtures but gussied up with a chandelier at one spot meant for a bigger group while keeping its causality in check. The wait has been manageable, food show up fast with the Baked Mushroom S$12.50, enter the scene first. \"Magic bread\" - a paper-thin baked sheet that offers lighthearted crunch accompanied by a bed of juicy portobello slices cobwebbed by the gluey mozzarella, garnished with a bunch of fresh thyme before baking. The dish was minimally seasoned which I find something lacking somewhere (suit one with a lighter taste buds).The spotlight was with this Pumpkin & Smoked Mozzarella Nachos S$7.50. Not the classical corn snacks we could think of, but a deep fried Italian ravioli! I lingered at the earthy flavor eludes from the root vegetable smashed together with cheese, though the filling was slightly dry but that didn't penalize the rating. The crispy pasta adds scores while the sweet \"amaretti cookie\" (Italian macaroon alike) crumbles topping the nachos magically brought out the unique saltiness in the arrabbiata sauce. Don't get intimidated by the word \"fiery\", the Italian dipping sauce is not spicy at all. The Italians named it \"angry\" because of the chili element in the bell pepper. This is one of the \"tryable\" antipasti at Jamie's.The one that stole the limelight at the entire meal session was the 30-days matured Prime Ribs. Presented in a chop-off tree bark, this 350g piece was beautifully cooked to medium with a tantalising charred surface, evenly and modestly seasoned in a memorable peppery accent. The angus cut was sublime - piped in juice, oozing from its baby pink moist texture. Tender with a good chew perfected by the honeyed balsamic dressings mixed wild mushroom greens - endives are crunchy with an intense peppery flavor from the rocket leaves. The portion fills a gentleman comfortably but somewhat excessive for a lady, so sharing out will be an optional to savor this well-executed S$59.50 piece of strip loin. Leave out the truffle butter/shaven truffles (additional S$5), the meat is good on its own.The Prawn Linguine was a decent choice but less remarkable. I had a smaller serving for S$17 while a regular bowl tags a S$25. Gently garlic-scented in the clear tomato broth, the chili elicit more heat than I expected. The cut-up prawns were responded well with a light crunch and very succulent. Excited with freshly handmade pasta but dispirited by the bite - even the exterior of each strands were hard; not center-hard like what defines al dente. The daily pasta-making-effort in the house has gone to waste. I shall opt for a risotto when I revisit.The Panna Cotta S$9, indeed emits the biggest spark in tandem with its eulogization! Simplicity with a impressive consummation. Heighten by its sweetness, I went weak when I popped the first scoop into my mouth. I was smitten by the shivering cream gelatin on the plate as I playfully shook it; the tart berries balanced up the the candied taste in the alabaster jelly in excellence.",

The service could be better as we had to wait close to twenty minutes to finally be served. I expected a bit more from the servers as they seem to be quite short staffed. The food was not bad but not quite memorable. The prawn linguine was good and the pork chop was tasty and well prepared. The overall ambience was quite comfy and laid back.",
