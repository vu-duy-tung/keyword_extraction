    "text": "Singapore has our chicken rice and laksa wars. Madras has an ongoing idli war. Ask anybody from Madras: which place serves the best idli in Madras? You'll get wildly differing answers. Murugan is one of the strong contenders in Madras. When in Madras I'm more of a Ratna Cafe idli sort of girl, but in Singapore I am delighted that I get Madras-style idli of Murugan quality right here in Little India. The idlis are hot and fluffy. The sambar is delish. Just the way it should be. The filter coffee. And lemon rice... when they opened in Singapore, every Madras and Bangalore transplant in Singapore did a little leap of joy.",

Fresh, hot and fluffy, with just the right amount of sourness from the fermented batter.Fresh coconut chutney, curry leaf chutney, mint chutney and a 4th one I have not been able to ID. Piping hot sambar with eggplant and drumsticks (vegetable from India, not chicken my carnivorous readers) - makes for a satisfying meal after 2 hours of jostling through the narrow aisles of Mustafa. Do not recommend eating here before the shopping as you might just turn around and go back home to sleep it off.Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the tamarind rice, lemon rice and tomato rice, all of which are fabulous.",

    "text": "Idlis are fluffy south indian rice cakes. The process for making them is simple - you prepare a batter made of grounded rice and lentils, leave the batter overnight to ferment, and then cook the batter into small fluffy cakes. Simple, no? While it may be easy to make okay idlis, it is extremely hard to make exceptional idlis. In most places, the idlis are either too hard, or too sticky, or too fluffy. Getting that right balance is very, very hard. But the chefs at this tiny hole in the wall have mastered it. It wouldn't be an exaggeration for me to say that I've had the best idlis here outside of India.When you enter the shop, the waiter will bring you a banana leaf \"plate\" adorned with four different types of chutneys. Typically, it's coconut, mint, coriander and groundnut. The chutneys are very flavorful and freshly prepared. You place your order by marking the number of idlis, dosas, your regular south indian fare on a piece of paper and then sit back, relax and enjoy the meal. If you lick the chutneys clean off the plate, you can always ask for more. We visited this place twice during our stay in Singapore and got Idli, Onion Rava Dosai and Set Meals (Sambhar Rice, Lemon Rice and Curd Rice). Everything was fantastic in terms of taste.The only unfortunate thing is that this place cannot handle large crowds. There are only one or two folks waiting the tables and when pummeled with a big crowd of hungry patrons, these folks just simply give up. During one such rush period, we had to wait for half an hour just for someone to come take our order. I can understand that waiting is inevitable, but allowing patrons to sit down at a table and avoiding their calls and gestures is not the solution. Perhaps, they can have proper wait-lists or at least reassure patrons rather than ignoring them. Oh well, I won't complain too much because they are just understaffed when faced with large crowds and the food is so good! Just for their sake, I hope they can handle this better so that they don't lose customers.",

I'm so sad that a place which has such good Indian food had the most disappointing service. Firstly, the tables weren't wiped properly, I had to ask someone twice to give us the menu to place the order. Second, we had a toddler with us and he wasn't given a plate and when I asked for a small plate they said we don't have it. They could have arranged something for a 2 year old! Third, I had to wave my hands to place top up order, ask for more chutney and finally our coffee took almost 15 mins to be served. The icing on the cake was that when I went to pay the bill they had charged less money for what we had ordered and I had to stand there and correct her and tell her that I should be charged more. Though I felt proud of following the honor code there was no appreciation from them ( a sorry or a thank you?). Had they served us better, we might have had a few more rounds of idlis!",

I think the first round of idlis were a bit undercooked and the meduvada was definitely a bit raw (hence the 4.5 and not a full 5), the second round if idlis were spot on. The dosa was amazing, cripsy crunchy and all levels of goodness. Loved the variety of chutneys as well. and the filter coffee was an amazing finish. They just need to be a bit more consistent and improve their service a bit ( I had to tell them 3 times to get a refill on the chutneys)",
