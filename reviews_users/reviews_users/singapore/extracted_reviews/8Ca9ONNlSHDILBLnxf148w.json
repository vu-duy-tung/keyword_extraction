    "text": "Got lost in Orchard Central (as always) while looking for a restaurant and chanced upon Sumiya. I glanced through the menu quickly, saw a $4.90 beer, grab-as-much-as-you-can edamame and nabe-style porridge. The latter two items jolted my memory of Wong Ah Yoke's review a few months back and I figured this place can't be that bad if he thought it warranted a review in the Sunday Times.Sumiya comes pretty close to replicating the izakaya experience you'd get in Tokyo. They've got high tables with bar stools, sit down tables sectioned off by...plastic shower curtain things (totally cracked us up) and quirky cartoon masks on the walls and waitresses' arms. We loved the weird Japanese vibe and I half expected a robot with a chain saw to pop out. The menu is pretty extensive and varied. The vegetable based dishes, sushi and sashimi are all less than $10 a serving, while the proteins are around $8-20. The great price points mean you can throw down some beers AND try new dishes without blowing a hole in your pocket. We started our meal with a Singapore roll that was simple but fresh, with crunchy cucumber sticks paired with salmon and roe. Then came 2 salads: a pumpkin mash with sultanas that was absolutely delicious and a \"sesame fresh veggie\" dish that had dou miao and julienned carrots cooked in a mushroom broth, topped with what tasted like yuzu shavings. Both these salads were light but with a very interesting blend of flavors and textures.With 1 round of beer down, we ordered a grilled amberjack head ($9!!), grilled skewer plate, deep fried squid and oysters. The amberjack head was fresh and grilled crisp, so we picked it clean like good Asians should. I don't think Sakuraya even sells grilled fish heads this cheap so this dish made me doubly happy. The deep fried dishes were decent and i liked the spicy sauce paid on the squid, though some of the batter on both dishes got soggy quick. Finally, the skewers were a little disappointing as all of them seemed just under grilled and lacked the charcoal \"wok hei\" you normally get from a master kushiyaki chef.Overall we had a delicious meal and the Asahi drafts were, get this, bone cold chilled. Think of all the sad insipid beers you've had that withered in Singapore's heat. Yep our beers came in chilled glasses, a good inch + of head and the golden body was ice cold. I almost weeped. The servers at Sumiya were also very quick and attentive, delivering the food the minute each kitchen station put them out, which is critical when you want hot food to go with your beer. Lastly, it feels like everyone was happy to be at Sumiya, which is something I don't see often at restaurants here. Sure the food isn't fancy, but its executed pretty well. We had an unexpectedly great evening here and if you don't take my word for it...half the house was Japanese, so it must be up to their standards at least!",

Note that in the evening, you cannot see the night view because of the glass reflection and the bright internal lights. The food is economical and reflective of the standard. The Wagyu beef skewer is priced at $11 and I wonder if the chef cooked the wrong beef. The Unagi rice was interesting that can be eaten on its own or mixed with soup.",

    "text": "If memory serves me well, this place was better a couple of years ago, when I last visited. Prices have soared. Beer used to be $4.90 (as it should be at an izakaya!) but it's now $5.80 during happy hour (ends at 7pm), and $8.80 after. The fun \"edemame grab\" used to be $6 and it's now $18!! Whaaaaat.Food was ok, some items better than others. The grill/skewers are good, as was the beef tongue. The current uni (sea urchin) promotion is disappointing. $24.80 for a little tray, which is fine, but then the uni were really small and not particularly tasty. :(",

    "text": "My flight out of Singapore was at 3pm, I needed to check out of the hostel at 130pm and be at the airport by 2pm. We got there at 1245pm and we were asked for reservation, we didn't have one since we wanted to go on a whim. Thankfully, we beat the lunchtime rush as quite a few people came in afterward from the offices around Orchard. Food: 5 Stars - We ordered the set that came with various sashimi on rice (refer to Cindy Q's photo) (salmon, bluefin tuna, red snapper, and maybe another but I can't identify, avocadoes), chawanmushi, mochi, miso soup, and a couple other side dishes. It was very filling and cost less than $20SGD, for the amount of food and the quality, couldn't have asked for better. We also had a skewer of Japanese wagyu (not necessarily the same as Kobe beef, as that can only be had in Japan and possibly Macau), which was really good and tender but it was very expensive for the 4 pieces we received for $15SGD. Service: 3 Stars - although it wasn't busy when we were there we weren't particularly welcomed and it almost felt as if we were being rushed though they never actually said anything. We were never asked how the meal was which would have been nice considering we ordered a lot at just under $100SGD. Service was average I would say. Overall I would go again because the food was top quality, service quality made me want to order less.",

    "text": "utterly fantastic and amazingly fun izakaya at the top of the stupidly-designed orchard central. today, I bring you a gem. I visited this place for an invited tasting - and the food was great, the atmosphere authentic and incredibly fun - and I know, pffffff. invited-schmited what-had-I-expected.so I sent my parents on to the restaurant the weekend after my visit for a proper litmus test, and they came back full of praise for the place. which makes me really glad - because now I can be utterly effervescent without qualm.I can't quite recall the last time I ever described a place as fun - and I'm not really that sort of bouncy jovial person anyway (I might swing a little too much to the other side of things) - but that's all I thought while there. izakayas are boisterous places - plates of good food and never-empty glasses of beer to lubricate conversations and wind down after a long day, and staff who know how to keep the place cheerful and loud enough for you to do so; this place has all those qualities in spades.as it is, the dishes are both familiar and well-prepared - don't come expecting overtly innovative preparations and poncy arrangements. the food surpasses my favourite conveyor belt place - and while it isn't posh japanese fine-dining, it truly is very good. fresh ingredients simply prepared, an array of comfortingly familiar flavors, and served at a well-met pace.n.b. get the yakitori with the leeks - those were some delicious things. the place is genuinely lovely: a vantage point over town, and a location so exclusive as to be both intimate and cosy - and it truly does remind me of japan. there is proudly-displayed vintage paraphernalia strewn all over - and the place is divided between three historic styles of izakaya dining, onward from the '50s. my memory is a little wonky - so let's call them the low-one (cosy and casual), the tall-one (more glamorous by the floor-to-ceiling-windows) and the outdoor-one (where you barbecue your own meats).the staff were friendly, enthusiastic - and gracious the way only japanese can be. be prepared for a boisterous night - I've been told the asahi is the cheapest here at $4.90 a mug, which might account for it - and if not, it's a welcoming place where you can, like me, clink your water to your friend's beer mugs, and call it a day.and if that all weren't enough, here's the kicker: almost every dish on the menu is priced at less than a tenner. I think that's completely ridiculous (by which I mean stupendously good) pricing, and it certainly made my parents happy when they got the bill. great ambience and good food (and cheap beer, if you're into that) - I certainly will be coming back.",
