    "text": "For full reviews and photos, visit my blog!If you want a quiet brunch in town, Nassim Hill Bakery, \u00a0does a good job of satisfying an egg craving. The outpost at the hidden part of Tanglin Post Office is nowhere to be seen from the main road. The place wasn't too packed on a Saturday afternoon. I don't think 1pm is too late for brunch. I hope it stays this way, though i've let out on this secret. Bistro and Bakery by day, Nassim Hill Bakery does a wholesome breakfast food for egg crazy people like me. At night, she transforms into a bar serving unique cocktails and the aromatic Grimbergen draught beers (A Belgian abbey beer first to debut in Asia and exclusive to Nassim Hill and 1128). A dinner menu is also available.All breakfast sets comes with a basket of bread, all freshly baked by Freshly Baked, one of my favorite bakeries! Head Baker Audrey takes charge of the bakery section and supplied Nassim Hill Bakery with the same breads that is ever so perfect and familiar. The bread basket includes the fluffy white ciabatta, the yeasty and malty Grimbergen Ambree bread, fluffy Walnut raisin bread and cereal rye bread.The Hearty Scrambled Eggs ($20) was creamy and runny and it was served with Swiss cheese, French Rosette de Lyon salami or prosciutto with our signature Grimbergen Ambr\u00e9e beer bread.Lovely Eggs Benedict ($20) on the airy white ciabatta pillows. Perfectly poached eggs with chunky succulent and sweet smoked ham, creamy hollandaise sauce with the right amount of acidity, what more can i ask for in a Benny? I reluctantly swapped a half of my benny with S's Hot Reuben, which i ordered for him because i wanted to try. Haha. I did not regret exchanging our dishes at all. Seriously, this is the star attraction at Nassim Hill. The Hot Reuben ($18) is a massive sandwich of sliced corned beef with melted emmental cheese, saurkraut, onions and Russian dressing on their signature Grimbergen Ambr\u00e9e beer bread. This sandwich is absolutely appetizing and no one flavor overpowered the other. The malty aroma in the bread could be tasted in every bite. This is definitely my must-order from now on. Their coffees ain't quite impressive and neither were their iced teas. The mocha was way too sweet, even for the boy with the sweet tooth. Chocolate syrup=meh but i love the ginger snapps that came with it. Yums. Adding to my list of yummy brunches in town!",

    "text": "A go-to brunch place for a couple of reasons.- The Chili Crab Spaghetti is insanely, insanely delicious. Spicy with lots of chilli padi and the most perfect chilli crab sauce, fit for pasta. I happily finished the $25 bowl.- The egg dishes are fairly well done and consistent. The chocolate banana waffle stack is quite a load if you like eating dessert for brunch. I'm personally not a fan of their dry french toast. - The free bread baskets have excellent bread. Eat them carbs people.- Nassim Hill is generally frequented by the older aunty/uncle or family crowd, as opposed to young kids with SLRs and too much make up. I don't know but somehow that makes me feel more at peace eating a meal there. The tables are also fairly spaced out so you don't have to listen to annoying, vapid mealtime conversations. - Prices are decent The one thing I don't like is the service. It's a bit of a blank-stare-who-ordered-this-item kind of place and they serve water when you're about to die from a parched throat. Otherwise, this is a safe weekend bet.",

I still like the coffee! They now have \"afternoon tea\" special - daily from 3p - 6p.any coffee/mocha/latte/hot cocoa/tea with a slice of cake for $8.95 or so. (below $9). which is a very good deal. I do miss their pancakes though. I'm not sure why they take it off the menu. fyi - eggs dishes are only served till 5p, except for the Steak and Eggs. and they have a 1 for 1 deal for the entrees with dbs/posb card, on tue - fri...till july 31st....lastly, yes, service is spotty on weekends.",

    "text": "one of my newest favorites - so good I returned a second time in a matter of three days (sometimes you have to give in be kind to yourself). both times, i was surprised at such fantastic execution of brunch classics - it's good, simple cooking done well; big portions I want for a meal that marries the best of the morning and the start of the afternoon; a beautiful space with beautiful people and the option of champagne.everything we had was better-than-average and well on its way to excellent, so let's start with that. a plate of three american-type pancakes came with a scoop of blueberry ice-cream, berry compote, crumble sprinkles, and REAL maple syrup. the hot reuben is a house specialty - and deservedly so. it's a hearty wholegrain beer bread with enough structural integrity to hold the melting morass of cheese, sauerkraut and corned beef in, served alongside a fresh green salad. quite completely delicious, and properly rave-worthy.on my second visit, I had the grilled cajun chicken on wholegrain; not nearly as fantastic as the hot reuben, but this was a very generous portion of marinated chicken stuffed between actually-crunchy leaves and another bit of good bread.both the poached and scrambled eggs were decently done too - but you must finish with the waffles - dark-brown belgians with crunchy exteriors but still creamy enough inside, dusted with icing sugar and served with more of that delicious syrup. the sausage alongside was tasty enough - it's a hearty breakfast or a could-I-have-more-please dessert.this is as sparkling a review I can write while being objective, and really - just give it a go, it's pretty darn brilliant.",

Never had a problem with food taking a long time to arrive. So far we've tried the whole meal waffles, pancakes, fish and chips, egg breakfast sets and they were all yummy and of good portions. The coffees here are good too and double shots, only thing missing is they don't have the option of soy milk available. The gingerbread cookie they serve with the coffee and tea are delicious and we usually buy a whole bag to take home :)",

The beers were poured into frosted glasses, and were very refreshing. I could keep drinking and drinking my amber if not for the fact that my food came very soon after.So I ordered a reuben sandwich. The bread was nice and soft with a slight sweetness to it. The pastrami was tender. There was nice onions in the sandwich too. But I wasn't impressed, and in fact was rather frustrated at why I was still underwhelmed. After a whole day of thinking and discussing with fellow foodies, it finally dawned on me that (and this is kinda embarrassing for me to admit this) the sandwich was just not greasy enough! Maybe I'm used to something with more spice, something with more cheese, something with more warmth. Something this healthier version didn't quite meet.",

    "text": "Nassim Hill Bakery Bistro Bar has one of the most interesting concepts - bakery with brunch items in the dawn, bistro in the noon, and transformed to a charming bar by dusk with DJs spinning at the side. If this bar within a post office concept seems familiar to you, it is also done up by Imaginings who is also behind KPO, WALA WALA, Balaclava and 1128. Beer drinkers can rejoice because you can tap your own draught beers at the end of the counter. (I unfortunately, don't drink beer.) Considering I am not quite a carb-person, I fell in love with the Grimbergen Ambree bread ($8), a Grimbergen (Belgian abbey beers) infused bread created by Head Baker Audrey from Freshly Baked at Killiney Road. (No wonder the bread and cakes taste so familiar. The KPO probably approached her since they are 'neighbours'.) The bread is very wholesome, full-bodied and hearty, with a slightly rustic feel to it. Extremely satisfying with the marmalade jam.",

The next sandwich they couldn't tell us when it would be ready, so we took it to go. Very disappointed in the service. We asked several of the staff to check on our food and got blank stares and placating responses (no apology for the delay), but no food. When we finally got the second sandwich in a to-go bag, the waiter said sorry. But if they were really sorry, they would have given us our drinks for free or made some legitimate effort to get us out food in a reasonable time. It really cannot possibly take 40+ minutes to make a BLT with avocado. And that sandwich was forgettable. A small slice of tomato on each half was too paltry. Not going back again and not recommending this place. With so many options in Sg there is no need to have such a terrible experience.",

I categorized the night as follows:THE GOOD:- Burrata, arugula, tomatoes and watermelon - tasted fresh and yum, almost ordered a second one.- The Big dipper (crab, artichoke and spinach dip): good dip but not enough bread, extra charge for more bread.- Poutine: tasty fries, however they should not call it Poutine as it does not taste like it, more like loaded fries.- Prosecco: two types available and the staff is generous with the top-ups (when asked)THE SO-SO:- Grilled Chicken Quesadilla - Steak and eggs- Sweet potato fries- The service: I guess your typical spotty service, had to ask for top ups of the drinks and remind them of our request for extra bread.THE BAD:- Roasted bone marrow: typically one my favorite things to eat but had literally no flavor, looked impressive though.Overall I find this one of the better Ladies Night deals and there were quite a few dishes I gladly eat again so 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.",

The skillet eggs is pretty spicy but it is so good. I am quite taken with the spicy huevos Benedict. It comes sprinkled with chili padi. Wow! The coffee is from LIberty Coffee which is one of my favorites, plus it is a double shot. I don't know much about coffee or where Liberty coffee is from, but it is smooth and is not too acidic. I don't need to add sugar to my flat white. So yay!The burger is also a good and safe choice. I am not that into its pasta or poutine though. Get the sweet potato fries and waffle. It is one of the better ones around. For a light bite, the chicken quesadilla is pretty delish. I just saw the dinner menu and the rosemary lamb chop description looks tempting. So I guess I need to go back again for dinner some day.",

I don't think the place is perfect, but nothing really offended me.I came here for brunch on a Saturday with a friend. The online reservation was fully booked, but they said we could walk in. Walking in before 11am was OK. We were seated immediately. Soon after, the place really started to fill up. I had the bacon and cheese waffles, and my friend had the blueberry pancakes. The blueberry pancakes were extremely fluffy, and tasted just right. My bacon waffles tasted more of bacon and cheese than waffles. Definitely delicious. We ordered a cup of tea each, and that wasn't memorable. They give you a teapot of hot water, which is good for about three teacups. The water kept warm for a long time, which was surprising.I thought the food was well done, although it would have been a better deal if it was a dollar or two cheaper. I used my DBS credit card and got 10% off so that was pretty sweet. This is the first brunch place I've been to in Singapore, and I wouldn't mind coming back again. But I would like to check other places out.",

It took a while to come, so be prepared to wait.So my Eggs B wasn't awesome, but the bread they served before you eat what you ordered is amazing, so it made up for the lacklustre eggs. My friend had a decent coffee (or so he said). This place is a wee bit inaccessible without a car, because it's quite far from the nearest MRT station (Orchard), so come here with a friend who drives, or even better, don't come at all. Food was pricy and I didn't feel satisfied with my brunch.",

    "text": "Never returning to this place. There are so many cafes in Singapore, so to be competitive I think the very least is to have kickass food or service. Customer service really sets the tone of your restaurant. I'm sure I had special sauce in my food today. The staff are smiley until a hiccup happens. This is what I mean - today I ordered a cake and coffee set before ordering a snack. This is all within like 10 minutes apart. when the savory snack arrived, I moved the cake to the side to eat the snack first. Halfway through it, I realized the cake was missing! We completely did not see the waitress clear it, but we only had 3 bites and it was such a waste to clear. We informed her it was a mistake and she said she assumed we didn't want it since we put it to the side (Just ask next time!). She was apologetic and said she would get it back. You wouldn't believe what she did next. She brought half a slice of the cake. A half slice! We were weirded out. I mean, what is she going to do with the other half? I thought that was completely cheap. We were like huh? And she told us it's because we ate almost half of the cake (not true) but whatever, the cake was ok tasting but not worth this rubbish! If they can be so cheap, you won't want to know what lame ingredients they may be using. So yeah, no smiles from all the staff after we complained it wasn't cool to be cheap about the cake. It's such a small matter but they've lost some pigs as customers.",

    "text": "Friends suggested lunch here to enjoy the good ambience and good food. I am impressed with the interior design of the cafe which gives out this relaxing vibe once you're inside. Many reviews suggested a Hot Reuben so I'm not gonna ignore that.Turned out that the sandwich was massive (for me at least) and my friend actually betted that I couldn't finish it by myself. So to prove him wrong (I'm a fighter), I ate slowly to savour and also to not overkill myself in the start of the meal. The sandwich was rich in flavour and I can't break it down to the individual tastes but it all came together very nicely. I opted for the set and they had cauliflower soup then. It was smooth and good and flavourful! Nice! The ambience was very chillaxing and a beautiful way to start the morning. The interior is clean and bright, plus it sure doesn't hurt to have the whole place smell of fresh bread to hit you (nicely) in the face as you walk in.Will bring hubby here to share the beautiful experience.",

    "text": "Decided to come here with a few others on a Saturday around 6.45pm. Parking was pretty easy but the layout of the building was like a maze and after 5 minutes, my friend and I figured out how to reach the front of this cafe and towards the end, we realized there was another shortcut (next to the lift) and you could walk in from the back door.Ordered these few dishes1) Tonkatsu (entree) - portion was pretty small and it was only an average dish with a high price tag.2) Full sized chili crab (pasta) - didn't have much crab meats in the dish and doesn't look photo worthy like the pictures on the website my friend gave me.3) Two faced pizza - half salami and half blue cheese with arugula. This was pretty good. Pizza come in thin crusts which made it crunchy. Even though the ingredients were rather normal, somehow the mixed ingredients added flavor to the two different types of pizza.4) popcorn chicken bites - came free as an option if you made a reservation through hungrygowhere. Came in smaller pieces but was pretty good after a few bites. Not as crunchy as I thought it may be and I couldn't taste much of the sriracha sauce.5) pear cheddar crumble (dessert) - was not too bad but would probably prefer the crumbles to be more flaky and crunchy.Price here was pretty steep and the food wasn't too impressive either. Definitely a good place to chill if you are into alcoholic beverages.",

    "text": "Popped by around the area during lunchtime on a Tuesday and the staff seemed overwhelmed by the crowd. The pair of us managed to get a seat without reservation luckily. Long story short, our coffee orders got mixed up with the table behind and the Cheddar Cheese with Bacon Waffle arrived at the table looking haphazardly put together. Staff forgot the condiments for the waffle so my partner chewed through half a dry waffle before I realised that the next table had butter and honey to go with their waffles. The skillet eggs I had was really good though and I liked that it was spicier than others I've tried so far. The flat whites which we finally had after much confusion and sorting out, were really decent too. It was just unfortunate that the staff was unable to cope with the swarming lunch crowd on our visit.",
