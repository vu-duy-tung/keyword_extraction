    "text": "Located in the food hall under Raffles City, we stopped here for ramen lunch amidst our hot travels around Bugis/City Hall.This ramen spot is definitely a little close in quarters, as you can basically hear what the table next to you is saying--and there's never enough room for the servers to squeeze by the other tables to get to yours...so we had to tell our server our orders across the other table. Awkward to say the least, but everybody seemed very chill about it.They also do drinks, and had some alcoholic happy hour of sorts...which I thought was a little out of place. It's a ramen spot, soooo where's the sake and beer? The ramen itself was delicious and perfect in portion size. We had the miso and shiro ramen, and I loved their noodles. So chewy/QQ and the right consistency in broth, but a bit on the richer side.I'd definitely recommend Daikokuya ramen, and when we were walking around that day...other lunch spots didn't really jump out at us. The pricing is around $11+ for a bowl of ramen, which is on the average scale. Service was quick, but no fuss. They don't provide napkins, so it's good to bring your own. Otherwise, the AC is nonexistent so try not to stick to your chairs.",

I ordered this as part of a friend's set that came with the mini rice bowl, ramen, and a salad. The salad was unimpressive - iceberg lettuce with tomatoes and dressing thrown on. Wouldn't order it on its own but the other salads on the menu might be better.",

    "text": "The ramen here always hits the spot - chewy and tasty with a fragrant broth, and not the oiliest of the ramen's that I've tried. Having side dishes and curry rice options are also a good idea so friends who don't really like ramen have more options to choose from as well. \u00a0I really like how they have a 'mini' option (smaller sizes - that are usually around 2/3 of the price of the standard bowl of ramen) as I'm a grazer and don't like big meals - combined with the fact that I have a really sweet tooth, it always leaves me room for an after dinner snack and dessert. \u00a0The raffles city outlet really annoyed me the last time I went with their choice of music though - coupled with it being blasted over the speakers, it was hard to think of anything else besides the Vengaboys' Shalala Lala song that played TWICE in my short 25 mins there. \u00a0I'm not sure if I'm alone here but I don't really like teenage pop music blasting over the speakers over dinner. \u00a0If the management considered changing the choice of music that would be a huge plus. \u00a0Didn't encounter this as the Paragon outlet.",

The saving grace of the ramen was the pork which was just about tasty enough to warrant the price of dinner.With so many superb ramen joints around Singapore and even one just on level one of City Hall, I think there is almost no reason for me to visit this eatery again.",
