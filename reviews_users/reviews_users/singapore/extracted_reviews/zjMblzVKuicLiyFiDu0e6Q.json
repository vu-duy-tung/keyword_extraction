    "text": "It baffles me how this eatery (note: eatery, not restaurant) has escaped my radar, as I grew up in the East. Not to mention, a good friend whom I often visit stays round the corner. As I am not a fan of black herbal chicken, I always bypass this place. Until another friend brought us here a month ago. Since then, I have been visiting this place every week. Not once, but a few times. Apparently, Seng Kee's claim to fame is the famous herbal mee sua. It was not a dish that i managed to savour until probably visit #10. Instead, her scallop/seafood/minced pork mee sua won my heart. It's is not oily, not MSG ladden, not salty.....just tasty and flavourful. It is especially platable when one is convalescing or for the elderly .....coz it is so easy to swallow.When I got better, I tried her other dishes :1. Fried Bee Hoon pancake - Excellent if u don't mind the heatiness & less healthy dish.2. Herbal mee sua - very good value for money. Not overly salty, flavourful.3. Salted egg fried chicken - unbelievably good4. Bittergourd fried egg - flavourful5. Sambal Kangkong - very yummy6. Steamed fish - fresh but super super pricey. i will not take this dish again bec it is just too expensive.In conclusion, I believe Seng Kee caters for family meals as well as a single person meal. There's long queues in the weekends....so I try to avoid the peak hours.It is lovely to sit at this airy corner coffeeshop eating yummy food without a post MSG-attack.The dessert - honey lemon jelly is superb too.The food here is not terribly pricey nor terribly good value. It is no wonder the corner coffee shop has expanded to 3 shops during the weekends. Opening hours : 11 am to 4am Parking : Street parking or at the temple grounds opposite",

    "text": "Popping by the East Side of Singapore and we got ourselves dinner at Seng Kee Black Chicken Herbal Soup. It has been a while since I visited them a few years back and I was surprised by how much they have expanded from just a stall front to a few in the same place.Queue was unavoidable during peak period and to be honest parking around the vicinity is not an easy task though Free Parking is available.Orders were quick to serve, although the soup may looked watery with spring and fried onions. The consistency of herbal taste is good. Rather, it was addictive and I would say there is a good \"depth\" in the soup.Texture of Mee Sua was just right and was not too lumpy. I had totally enjoyed the simple tastes through the bowl of soup in mix pork.Portion was reasonable and lean meat was tender. Kidneys had been well handled leaving no trace of foul smell and what I like best was those thinly sliced livers that was not overly hard to bite on.Besides being famous for its kidney Mee Sua, they are quite famous for their Cze Char too.Prawn paste chicken was notable, at least alot better than my last round of prawn paste chicken else where. Exterior was very crispy and at the same time also burning hot as they were just taken out of the oil pot. Just alone without the lime and belachan, they were good enough.The settings of the eating place make me feel like dining in Malaysia although the currency conversation rate can't really match the comparison. \u00a0Overall, such specialty is rather unique in Singapore and they had maintained a reputable name throughout the years.",

The herbal taste isn't strong so even folks who don't particularly enjoy herbal soups can enjoy this. They have a multitude of ingredient combos with the soup and I usually get beancurd skin with lean pork and liver for protein and iron. The meesua is only available later in the day though, for the earlier part, you can enjoy their good selection of zichar dishes as well.There is a particular waiter that I really like, he's OCD and MUST serve the spoons, chopsticks and sauces in absolute symmetry. I continue to observe him rearranging the chairs at other tables to perfectly align.Recommended for all groups and ages who enjoy some alfesco dining.",

The soup is not too thick with lots of chicken inside. I have mine without the kidney and intestines however, i do eat the kidney on occasion and its really really good. The soup is served really hot so be careful not to burn your tongue. There is also a deep fried prawn cake that you can order that goes really well with it. It is very tasty and wonderfully crispy. I've yet to try the otak-otak there however I have heard good things about it and will definitely do so the next time I go. The place is a 5 minute walk away from Kembangan MRT so its quite easy to get to. There are also quite a few safe parking spots in the area within a 500m radius so its definitely accessible and convenient to get to.",

    "text": "This humble restaurant along the main road is just across from Kembangan MRT station. It has roadside parking, but you can forget about that during the dinner peak hours. Fortunately, it's open till about 4am, so I often go there for supper later at night when it's cooler and there's less traffic along the road.Seng Kee's really well known for their black herbal chicken mee sua, which I really enjoy. Served piping hot, the herbal soup has got a peppery kick to it and lots of ingredients added to it. Be sure to specify if you want lean meat, innards or both. The mee sua itself is very smooth and soft, but if you leave it sitting in the soup too long, it does get a little bit too soft!They also serve other cooked dishes, and if you walk up to the counter, you can see all slices of fish on ice and choose the one you want. They steam their fish, and it's usually very fresh and appetizing.I also really like the otak otak, which is a much larger version they make themselves, served on a plate. It's moist and springy, filled with lots of fish chunks, and is properly spicy.The other dish I really enjoy is their tofu with minced meat sauce. The soft, silky tofu is drizzled in a savoury sauce cooked with minced meat. Healthy and tasty! Lastly, the other MUST TRY are the clams (lala) that are always very fresh. I've gotten a mouthful of sand a few times, but I've had that so many times, I suppose it's only fair for it to happen every now and then! The spicy sauce is also slightly sour due to the fermented beans they cook with it, and really whets one's appetite. Every time I eat the lala, I'm left wanting more!",

Since it was our first time here, I had the sliced pork, kidney and liver combination and it was great. As the bowl of mee sua is served piping hot, the kidney and liver may be slightly overcooked if you like yours slightly undercooked. The sliced pork was wonderfully tender and succulent. I would probably skip the kidney next time and have it just with sliced pork and liver.Hours: 5pm to 4am plus easy free parking by the road in the wee hours. Woohoo.",

Parking here can be tricky if you come around 10pm to 1am, but as the crowd thins out around 130am, it's easier to get a lot just outside the shop. The food is great, with their signature black herbal chicken soup being my favourite there. Service staff can get a little too over-enthusiastic at times, but don't let that bother you. My only gripe is that it can get really messy when there's a crowd, and they take a long time to clear up the tables. Oh, and smoking is pretty okay there - they've no designated smoking tables, so you light up at your own risk!",

If just meat alone is boring, you can request for a mix of pork balls and meat to keep things interesting. Parking is quite a hassle and the nearest public carpark (tiny!) is about 6-7minutes away. One thing I really like, after having such a 'heaty' meal, is that they have soya bean curd here to help wash your meal down. It's the same type that Lao Ban sells and I must say tastewise and texture, is very similar. Best of all, they open till late, so anytime you have the munchies, you know where to go!",

On certain occasions, the soup can be a little diluted. But most of the time it hits the spot, especially during the early hours of the morning you can hang out with your friends for a late night snack cause it only closes at 4am.We did try out other dishes too like the fish and crab tang hoon. The fish was a tad bland quite tasteless and the fish did not taste fresh also. The Crab Tang hoon ($45) which came in a leaf turned out very ordinary, not worth the price at all. The crabmeat also stuck to the shell and was very dry. The tanghoon was also too dry and overall not a good dish to remember the stall by.The \u00a0type of environment there is a self service type whereby you 'chop' the tables and order from the counter but sometimes the waitresses do take orders from you which is nice. At least they provide some form of customer service.",
