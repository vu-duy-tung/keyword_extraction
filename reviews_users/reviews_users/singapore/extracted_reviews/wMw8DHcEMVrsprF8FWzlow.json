I opted for the Dragon Whisker La Mian \"Long Xu Mian\" which is thinner then the usual La Mian. Somehow the portion seemed more perhaps due to the thinness of the noodle.We also ordered Xiao Long Bao which was perfect as usual - easy to pick one up without breaking the skin. You get the usual Crystal Jade standard in every bowl of La Mian and your money's worth. What's not to love about a bowl of La Mian under S$10?",

I like 3 of their la mian and tend to order these. Scallion and \u00a0shallot oil la mian - very plain but yet so tasty with the scallion shallot oil. Excellent to have this with other dishes. Dan dan mian - love the slightly spicy and sesame peanut sauce. Zha Jiang mian - perennial favorite with minced meat sauce. The above noodles are definitely much better than Din Tai Fung's version. The spicy and sour dumplings are good but have a thicker skin when compared to Imperial Treasure's version. The si ji dou (four seasons bean) is a favorite with the crunchy beans and salty olives.",

This looks to be a big chain with many different restaurants to cater to various appetites. Their Xiao Long Bao restaurant looks to be the smallest of the lot.Service was good and efficient and menu choices are plenty that will appease even the pickiest of eaters.we ordered the following - Steamed soupy Xiao Long Bao - definitely very simple and very flavorful! The soup was perfect and we did not need any soy sauce etc to enhance th etaste.Steamed BBQ Pork Bun Tian Jin style - great choice if you like pork bun - the meat mix was tasty and cooked just right.La Mian \u00a0soup with minced pork and vegetable wanton - another excellent offering on the menu. the wantons were super delicious and so was the clear soup! My wife loved it the most.La Mian soup with braised beef belly - The beef was braised to perfection - something I would have expected of a fine dining restaurant! The soup too was full of flavor and worked well with the beef sauce. (I got the soup on the side - dry option)Good food at very reasonable prices and definitely one of the best Xiao Long Bao choices in Singapore - not much variety of xiao long bao but still very good!",

In my opinion what sets their Xiao Long Bao apart is the soup filling, which has a better, tastier flavour.Another of my favourites here is the fried pancake with scallion, you simply can't go wrong with that. Great for sharing.And of course, their noodles are awesome. I love the Dan Dan Mian here, and their portions are immense. The first time I came I thought I could polish of one bowl of that plus share the fried pancake with scallion and some Xiao Long Bao, but how wrong I was!And price-wise, two people can comfortably eat for around 30 bucks, so I would say they charge reasonably well. Quite a value-for-money restaurant.But at this particular restaurant is in Orchard, be prepared to queue for around half an hour before you get a seat. Still, a worthwhile wait nonetheless.",

First, their service is good. There was once when I went there to have dinner on my own. Even though I was alone, it did not feel awkward and the waitress and waiter gave me ample attention even though it was just one customer. I also like the mix of patrons there. It gives a very lively and vibrant atmosphere to the restaurant (that said, the restaurant is not quiet most of the time). Last but not least, the food! The food is tasty, consistent over the past few times that I've been there. There are many kinds of la mian available; they come in different shapes and sizes. Trust me, any one will taste good! So don't be too fussed about the choice. Just enjoy!",

With the typical Chinese restaurant setting and comfortable seats, I was excited to start ordering after hearing good reviews about the place. The menu had so many variations of la mian itself and it took some time before I decided on one to order - Suan La La Mian (Sour and Spicy Noodles). I was shocked to see it arrive in a gigantic bowl. The noodles were springy and cooked just right, while the sauce had a great consistency and was filled with ingredients like tofu, black fungus and chicken meat. The sauce was also a perfect blend of sour and spicy and was therefore, appetizing. The service was great; the staff were really attentive and immediately attended to our needs and requests. They were also friendly and polite.",
