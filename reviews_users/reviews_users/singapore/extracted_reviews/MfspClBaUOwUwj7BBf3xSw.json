    "text": "Just another coffee shop.I've heard stories about Watanabe from my cousin, so I figured, I might as well try it while I'm in Singapore. I may have hyped myself too much, but I found nothing special about this place. The ambiance is rather unpleasant - a bunch of snobs talking about money. But let's talk about the coffee.I'm a huge fan of pour overs, but I found nothing special about theirs. It's literally just normal Brazilian pour over priced atrociously high. I believe I paid $9SG or more for the coffee, which I can seriously make at home. I've Geisha, Blue Mountain, Kopi Luwak and those definitely worth the price. I just can't justify and defend Watanabe.",

Lol.. call me mean .... but walking into a cafe/ restaurant on Saturday afternoon, I expected a warm welcome especially when you are not charging $2 for a cup of coffee but in the range of $6 to $9 ... I am not saying that they are rude or what, but they showing blank face, not even smiling. To me, they don't enjoy what they are doing at all. Alright, back to the food. I ordered a premium French toast set, come with a drink (you can choose from the list), it costs $17.90. Not a bad deal at all. The French toast came with blueberry sauce (they have 3 choices mango, blubbery and ... sorry I can't remember), topped with a vanilla ice-cream. It is good, but nothing fantastically impressive. I paired the pancake with hot soy latte. Pretty good. The place is not crowded, good place for friends gathering. And they do serve wines too. I will consider come here again, for the coffee.

    "text": "Located right next to the entrance of Isetan Scotts is Watanabe Coffee. Only a few weeks old and it's getting pretty popular to both the Japanese and locals.As with typical Japanese cafes, there's wooden benches that line the entrance, the idea is to sit there while waiting for your table. When I arrived at 130pm, I only managed to get a table at 230pm for 5 adults. A one hour wait, as they do not take reservations during lunch hours. Also take note, they only have two large tables to accomodate more than 4 pax.Looking through the menu, their drink prices caught my eyes. $8.10++ for an iced matcha latte! Their dutch style cold brew at $6.80 was the highlight of this cafe, with the word \"Coffee\" in the shop name, you would think they are proud to serve it. 1. Dutch Style Cold Brew (L) $6.80++It was incredibly bitter, even after adding condiments, but you could definitely feel the effect of this strong coffee! Apparently, they only make 10 cups of these every 8 hours. Interesting!2. Matcha Roll Cake $11.80++I love Japanaese roll cakes! This is no exception, the cake was moist and the cream was delightful. The green tea powder used to decorate the plate was a nice addition, and it was authentic and quite bitter. A good tea time snack!3. Ramune Float $2 add on (with the roll cake afternoon set)By it's own, it is priced at $9, a rather expensive ramune, which you can get at Daiso for just $2 in a bottle. It tasted like every ramune but their ice cream was pretty dense and didn't melt in the drink. Instead, I had to use the metal spoon to scoop up the ice cream.4. \u00a0French Fries with Truffle Salt $10.80++No lie, the whole cafe smelt of truffle! These fries were addictive. Not something I would normally order, but it was well worth the calories! The fries were crispy and not oily, the salt was evenly distributed and the smell is just so good!5. Matcha Ogura Honey Toast $16.80++Probably their best seller, as almost every table order one. It is a pretty instagrammable honey toast. It is huge, and I would recommend sharing it amongst 4 people! It comes with green tea ice cream, vanilla ice cream, red bean, whipped cream and 3 mochis.We tried cutting into it gracefully, but made a mess. The whipped cream melted too quickly. The bread on the outside was toasted well, and on the inside, white and fluffy bread that was quite airy, with a slight crisp on the edge. I think there's a few hits and misses here at Watanabe, first of all their service could be improved. The lady at the entrance was so busy, she was pretty rude to a number of people waiting in line. I did sit on the bench for an hour and observed her attitude, I ended up handling the menu to several people waiting in line with me, as they were all asking for menus, but she kept ignoring them. Yes, the cafe is full. Yes the shop is very busy, but don't act as if you're too busy to help others in line.Secondly, the food is quite pricey and not very impressive. However, they do carry alot of the typical Japanese favourites. I lost count of the number of Japanese families with young children that surrounded my table. Last of all, they need to either figure out a way to get people to leave when they're done eating or add more tables. I witnessed several parties using their laptops or reading magazines once they were done eating and no effort was made to hand them their bills. In the mean time, the queue outside the shop continues to grow with potential hungry customers.",

The pasta here has a very chewy consistency, and every strand was coated with creamy mentaiko sauce and topped with a mound of nori. Very tasty.Service here is a wee bit slow, but the environment was pleasant enough to have a chat in. I am not sure about prices, but I do remember the pasta's portion was on the small side, and slightly pricey for what it was.I would come back for the pasta.",

The syphon coffee came in a round flask that served ~3 cups.

The coffee paired well with the pudding.I would recommend the ice matcha latte though! The matcha was not overpowered by the milk and it was just the right amount of sweetness.If it weren't for the slow service (it took ~20mins for the drinks), this place would have received a 4/5.Note: Free wifi upon request",

    "text": "Overpriced and nothing like the original genre. But a good place for meetings, if you can handle the slow service, because both it and the food quality for the price point mean the cafe is half empty even on weekends, despite its extraordinarily busy location.We came for the breakfast sets. The idea comes from Japan, where you can find low priced cafes where salarymen swallow a quick pizza toast and filter coffee before heading to their offices. Efficiency and cost are the deciding factors, understandably that means the coffee quality takes a backstep.Unfortunately, Watanabe caught my attention by advertising being a roaster. This is a departure from the style. I thus had high expectations of my \"Dutch-style\" drip coffee... and they were most certainly not met. Either the coffee is stale, or it is roasted to such a high level as to be practically burnt. Since the beans I saw come off the roaster were a nice medium roast, I assume the former. I noticed the menu said $5 for a drip coffee, and $8 (if I recall well) for a \"special house roast\" or similar wording, which implies that the regular coffee does not come from their home roasted beans. Well, I can't complain. At the price point of the set, and considering the origin of the genre, it's not supposed to be a light roast filled with floral tones and a long finish. Still, disappointing.The service was slow not because of the incompetence of the staff - on the contrary, they did a marvellous job - but because the cafe is SEVERELY understaffed! There were only two people on duty, and this is not a \"8 seats at the counter only\" sized place. They looked pretty exhausted but dutifully processed all the orders as well as they could. My coffee arrived well after I had finished my toast and egg, and we waited 4 minutes to be seated despite a half empty cafe. It's OK if you expect it. The food - except toast - is extortionately priced. In fact, for 2 dollars more than the paltry looking \"wagyu\" roast slice (the thickness of a chashu slice at Sapporo Ramen) you can head for Bistro du Vin and have a 3 course lunch which is still awesome after all these years in the finest French bistro tradition, including foie gras stuffed ravioli with roast hazelnuts where the foie gras actually seems to have increased in size in the last 4 years... I disgress. The sofas and the armchairs are comfortable and the tables nicely spaced apart, so this is actually a great location for business meetings compared to alternatives in the area. This redeeming feature will probably see me back, as the average hipster cafe is usually packed to the brim and communal tables don't make for the best business setting.",
