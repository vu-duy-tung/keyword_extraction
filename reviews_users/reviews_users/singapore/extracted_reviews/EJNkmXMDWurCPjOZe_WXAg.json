    "text": "3.5 starsA goal of mine is to start using the buses more often so I can get to know Singapore a little better. After hopping off the bus and walking allllll the way up Dempsey Hill, I decided to reward myself by indulging in lunch at Jones. (Okay, walking up Dempsey Hill wasn't that bad, but come on, I should get some recognition for not driving or taking a cab out here!) I ordered the leg ham and gruyere cheese sandwich, with zucchini, tomato chutney, and apples. Sounds different and amazing, right?! Well, I was slightly disappointed. I found the sandwich to be a bit small and overpriced. I felt the ham just tasted like ham, the gruyere just like regular cheese, the tomato chutney was sweet but that's it, and the zucchini and apple portion was lacking. Basically, nothing really stood out and the flavors didn't seem to combine well. It was served with a small salad on the side, but I wish it had dressing on it. I did like the bread, as it was toasted perfectly.After paying my check, I decided to look at some of their grocery items. I love how they had a lot of Italian goods like bottled tomato sauces and dried pastas - I've been striking out on finding good Italian restaurants here so I'm always looking for quality ingredients to make my own Italian meals. The cheese room looked amazing but I was a bit intimidated by it. I also loved all the exotic teas they offered.Overall, so-so experience at the cafe, but totally loving their merchandise. This seems like the place to be on the weekends, so I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up here again. Looking forward to my next visit!",

The FnB isn't the cheapest, but I love their choice of desserts, including the nougat and rocky road which for some reason is not available at the Mandarin Gallery outlet.There's an airconditioned cheese room and quite a good cheese platter available, plus lots of fancy pricey grocer food to gawk at while you're here. While evenings and brunch times find it quite packed, weekday afternoons are really not crowded at all and its nice to just take your things up here to have a cuppa and unwind.Also cool: FREE WIFI (which is what I'm using to write this review now) FTW.",

The cold cuts and seafood are extremely fresh best eaten when paired with something from their extensive cheese cellar.Their range of products is extremely diverse & unique although sometimes a bit over priced.

A side order of sausages comes cut up in a bowl, not even the slightest effort to garnish, rather disappointing for an add-on that cost a bomb. Jones the Grocer was and still is to many a novelty. One drink to try though would be the citrus infused iced Earl Grey. Bergamot is relaxing and the citrus infusion pairs well and adds an extra kick to the refreshing cooler. If I do remember correctly, Jones also serves a good club or BLT sandwich. Not the best place for brunch but definitely a nice place to spend relaxing weekends!",

Service 5/5 attentive and helpful service throughout. Food 4.5/5we ordered pork ribs that comes with grilled corn and mashed potato, and it is as good as it can get. You can slice through the meat with just the weight of the knife and it melts in the mouth. The mashed potato is very fresh and goes well with the meat, no additional sauce needed. Can't really comment about the corn aside it being fresh since I don't like corn. The next food is prawn risotto which is first class, although I am not a fan of el-dente rice, therefore it is not as enjoyable as it could, but I appreciate the food prep and quality itself. The sauce is perfect, flavorful but not too much, the prawns are fresh and prepped excellently. I give an overall score of 4.5/5 because I haven't tried other options that will make me a regular yet, but will try since it is a nice place to hang out and chill while enjoying a good food and wine. A bit pricey but reasonable with the food quality offered.",

    "text": "jones the grocer is back in the game! They have streamlined and refined their concept to continue bringing us gourmet and quality food recognised, with a greater emphasis on promoting healthy eating and lifestyle. The airy Dempsey outlet is pretty much the same. Other than housing Singapore's first walk-in cheese room (with over 100 varieties), a large artisanal retail outfit, and bakery, jones has now added a brand new butcher's corner by Swiss Butchery as well. Have a meal here and then bring another meal (or 2) home!We started with the Cheese & Charcuterie board (3 items $35, 5 items $45, 7 items $55, additional items $8). This is served with truffle honey, jones olive oils, jones Egyptian dukkah and a selection of jones artisanal bread. I can't go on about how good the Stilton Blue was with the truffle honey. UMAMI. I would also add the smoked duck breast and some other cured meats to the mix.If you're not sure what to pair your cheeses with, don't fret. The on-site cheese experts would help you with that. There are also suggested accompaniments placed together with the different types of cheeses on the shelves so you can always pick them out yourself. A starter that is the equivalent of a main course is the Oriental Crispy Duck ($26) which is a pan fried duck confit served on a bed of mesclun salad tossed with shimeji mushroom, Russet potato, cherry tomatoes, and tossed in a plum dressing. Somehow the salad stole the thunder from the duck, which was simply a protein accompaniment that is rather characterless. jones Classic Wagyu Burger With Truffle Fries ($26) is the bomb. Resistance is futile. How can anyone say no to this juicy 120g 100% Australian wagyu beef patty with crispy bacon?! Of course, the various condiments layer on the flavors perfectly- melted gruyere cheese, truffle mayo, bois boudran sauce, pickles, hot English mustard, and caramelized onions. They even make their own fluffy brioche bun which held the stack perfectly. I also had to tell them to take away the fries, if not i would not be able to taste the rest of the food with my limited stomach space. The Asparagus Risotto ($24) was a creamy soft herb risotto with fresh asparagus, Taleggio and rana padano with black truffle oil. Expect this to be very very filling. I couldn't take more than 3 spoonfuls of this as it was rather cheesy, though bland. An enjoyable pasta was the Spicy Seafood Aglio Olio ($28), which was piquant and full of garlic. This dry pasta could do with a larger variety of seafood actually as it was mostly prawns (not that i mind but it did say that it's a seafood pasta). I wouldn't mind finishing a plate of this actually, but i thought the prawns were too powdery.Grilled BBQ Chicken ($26) was succulent and juicy, though pretty standard. The BBQ sauce had a nice hint of apple, which i thought was rather refreshing. That creamy and buttery garlic mash and minty coleslaw were kinda heavy for the dish. So i have found the best Warm Sticky Date Pudding ($15) in Singapore. Seriously this cake was buttery and moist and that salted caramel sauce was the bomb, especially with that rich vanilla bean ice cream. Any dessert after this just couldn't compare. Of course, if you're looking for something small, the freshly baked breads, pastries, and cakes would satisfy your tastebuds. All jones breads are organic and they only use premium ingredients here. So yes, welcome back, jones the grocer now!",

The lighting, sun shine streaming in and the white making it really so wonderful. Running around here looking at the beautiful products while waiting for the food to arrive is a must. I literally love looking at packing and unique brands and thats what this place is all about.My mum and I couldn't find anything we wanted to eat for lunch here but we would definitely recommend it for a breakfast/brunch place with the family or friends!",

We liked the ambience of a larder, kitchen counter and bakery all in one. With the slight air or organised grocery shop chaos. Some how works for tropical Singapore. Neat, tidy, works but cluttered in an ordered sort of a way. Wah! can do lah!",

It is where I reach a constant and even emotional state where everything feels like warm sand on your feet while looking at calm blue water. I don't even feel this chill when I actually have warm sand on my feet while looking at calm blue water. I simply love going to grocery stores and markets whether it is local dirty market, farmer's market, seafood auction, or night markets. As long as there are transactions involving goods and currency to change hands, it is fun to explore. I of course love it better doing so in far away exotic places compared to your neighborhood Walmart.While visiting Singapore, my friend took me here to Jones the Grocer for a little shopping for my thanksgiving cooking preparation. First time cooking turkey in Singapore and surprisingly between all the grocery stores and markets I visited in three days there, I got everything I needed.Jones was fun though small. It catered to foreign Caucasian clienteles and it is pretty well stocked with imported stuff including a great variety of boozes and other regular essential items you can't easily find while overseas at super augmented price. It was fun perusing the stuff that looked familiar to you back home though you're in the middle of Singapore where it was 90 some degree F in November.My friend Debby and I also stopped at the cafe to get some brunch after we both saw the magnificent cheese room. That was some serious cheese storage for South East Asia where their idea of cheese is milk processed into cube wrapped in blue Kraft box and called it \"Processed Cheddar.\" This cheese room is worth seeing and sampled.We ordered a salumi platter with Specks, Parma Ham, some type of salami, Stilton blue, some swiss cheese and a couple other things served with fresh breads and truffle honey. I have been searching for this truffle honey ever since. It was one of the best condiment I have ever had. I can't describe how good it was.If in Singapore, this does not scream local. However, it was one of my most favorite stops.",

Will probably be back when I'm in a more cheese-inquiring mood. (If you're a cheese person, just stepping in that cheese room is like instant therapy for the soul) ;)",

Makes working out of a cafe so much more convenient :)My friend really loves the ginger ale, but I didn't enjoy it as much since I'm not a fan of ginger. I wanted ice tea, which they dont serve - only ice lemon tea (sweetened) :/ Went with Earl Grey Tea, cant go wrong with that!Had a good time working there. Will be back again to work!",

It's not very crowded in the afternoons so its the perfect place to do some reading, or have a good catch up with a girlfriend. The staff are very chilled, attentive and ready to take your order when you're ready, but know how to give you your space to just relax. Really one of those rare places with a great atmosphere where you can escape from the bustling city.The food is good, they have a big range of cakes, slices, cheeses, breads and desserts to choose from - so you'll really be spoilt for choice. Coffee is excellent too - and very consistent, I've never been disappointed here. \u00a0And to top it off, I really like how they include the gst and service tax into their menus - I think everywhere in Singapore should do that! It makes our lives a lot easier when you need to split the bill.",
