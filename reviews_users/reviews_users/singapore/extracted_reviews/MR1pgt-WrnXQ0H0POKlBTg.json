    "text": "Decently good North Indian fine dining in an ornately decorated interior with very attentive service to match.Ended up here for dinner and I was rather impressed mostly with the decor and good service. Most of the dishes are decent, ranging from a few interesting dishes such as the paneer tikka starters to the standards like palak paneer (spinach) and gosht biryani (mutton).In particular, the assorted tandoori/tikka items are good, especially the fish. They used escolar, a fish that has a buttery rich flavour that gets nicely charred on the outside when grilled. (But limit your portions as this fish causes digestive distress due to a high wax ester content) You can see the chefs at work behind the glass, sticking the food into the tandoor.For some reason, the rasmalai (cottage cheese dessert) wasn't that great, it tasted weird and was rather dry when it arrived.All said and done, I found that a meal here is exceptionally pricey. Sticker shock set in after seeing the final total. (I fell off my chair when I counted 3 digits in front of the decimal point) Similar or better Indian food could be had elsewhere in Singapore for much much less. Perhaps the Sunday buffets are more affordable. Unless you have cash to spare, you can do better wandering over to Serangoon Road where a plethora of indian food choices await...",

The food is still pretty good - the crab masala is delicious, other dishes less unique but above average. However, although there were only 3 occupied tables when we were there, the (extremely polite) service staff were remarkably absent. The d\u00e9cor is dated, and the restaurant is located in a dreary basement of a fairly depressing hotel. At the high price they charge, one would be spoiled for choice in Singapore (Rang Mahal, Song of India, Punjab Grill, Yantra, etc).",

    "text": "This place was our go-to Indian restaurant as it was near our previous office. \u00a0Both the food and service were great.I went back two weekends ago and brought my friends from out of town as they wanted good Indian food. \u00a0Everything was doing well and I was enjoying my butter chicken until a small cockroach crawled onto my plate.I called the attention of a manager (he was wearing a suit versus a shirt like the other servers) --- and he just swiped away the cockroach -- I had to signal to please remove the plate. \u00a0So he removed the plate of food then replaced with a new plate, spoon and fork. \u00a0He apologized but I was surprised that it didn't seem to be a very big deal for them. \u00a0One server asked me if I didn't like the food because my plate was clean and when I said that I was eating and a cockroach crawled onto my plate, he laughed. \u00a0I was so shocked with the reaction.They didn't even offer to move us to another table nor to replace the food that was already on the table. \u00a0We all basically lost our appetite. \u00a0They gave a 20% discount but if a cockroach can crawl onto a plate by the main dining area, I can't imagine what's crawling inside the kitchen hidden from all the guests.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a place for Indian fine dining, rejoice in the fact that Tandoor Restaurant is back in the game following its recent face-lift (read about my previous review here). Not only has the decor been given a modern and classy revamp, the menu at Tandoor Restaurant, Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre, has also been made more refined and delicate while retaining its traditional roots. I was even more impressed with their story telling concept as the waiters took us through the interesting history of each dish. S and I were invited to sample the Dinner Gourmet Set ($68). If you're not up for the full course, there is a smaller course at $48. Vegetarian options are also available. We started with the Samosa Chaat, a light puff pastry shell stuffed with potatoes and chickpeas and topped with sweet yogurt and tamarind chutney. I love the creaminess and contrasting flavors of the dressing and was amazed at how light the puff was. Next, a platter of kebabs. My favorite was the Paneer Chupa Rustom, a potato croquette stuffed with spinach and cottage cheese. It's like a kinder surprise! The minced lean mutton kebab was very flavorful and soft, perfect if you were a toothless Indian king (no kidding, that's how the dish came about). On to the mains which were served with saffron rice or Naans. The Mango Curry was too addictive, a unique ripe mango curry from the Mangalore region of India. The other dish that i could not stop eating was the Murg Dum A Dum, chicken curry. Best mopped up with the garlic naan. We ended dinner with a trio of desserts. From the left, the sweetened carrot dessert Gajar Halwa which had the quality of a nutty rice pudding; a Bailey's Kulfi ice cream, and a Rose and Elaichi Panna Cotta.I have to say that Tandoor Restaurant really impressed us with its new direction. I enjoyed the food a lot better than i did the first time.",

    "text": "This place is a little out of the way being in the basement of the Holiday Inn. The fact that it has been around for 28 years says a lot for the quality and service. The bad news is they are closing soon. \u00a0The good news is that they will be re-opening after some remodeling work is completed. Which is great because I intend to be first in line. We took the special menu \u00a0and each dish had great flavour. Add in great service and you have all the ingredients of a regular haunt.",

    "text": "Pretty decent Indian food - especially the Naan. We had the usual suspects - tandoori chicken, spinach and cottage cheese, grilled shrimps, chic peas & curry etc BUT... We (6 of us) had spice intolerance (aka diarrhea) the next day (different degrees of it but 1 common factor. we had dinner together the previous night). I am not sure which dish was the culprit or maybe a combination of them. I am hesitant to blame the restaurant and call it food poisoning because it belong to a reputable hotel. However, I am very shocked that this happened to us because my family has had other Indian food at hawker centres/ food court/ kopitiams before and we were ok (being Singaporeans, we do consume a fair portion of Indian food so I am not sure why this happened). Anyways, this spice intolerance did put a damper on my overall experience. Definitely do beware, definitely not for weak to normal stomachs. For the taste, I think we can definitely find a better place without incurring the unsavory consequences of the aftermath...",

    "text": "Always consistent, satisfying Indian tandoor and moreIt's one of the longest-serving Indian restaurants (I understand that the owners of this particular hotel are Indian) since 1985, and you can bet they know what they are doing. The tandoor items come out succulent and singed to perfection, with the marinade well penetrated into the meat/vegetable. The lobster is a bit pricey, but go for anything else including chicken, mushrooms or prawn, and you'll be just as satisfied. The chefs work in a glass-fronted open kitchen, so you can see your dishes being prepared. A Sunday buffet is perenially popular, and helps ease first-timers into the various dishes available. The well-dressed waiters are mainly male, and pretty charming/chatty as they work - a mark of confidence. The setting includes a fountain in the middle of the seating area and lovely detailing of an Indian palace. There are plenty of choices of booth seats but we recommend the 2 tables in front of the tandoor kitchen - truly fascinating to watch the chefs at work.",
