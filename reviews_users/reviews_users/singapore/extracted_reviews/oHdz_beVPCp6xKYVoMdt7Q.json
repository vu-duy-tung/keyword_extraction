Not sure if standard has dropped or my taste has matured, but not as amazing as I remembered.Furthermore, waited 35mins for the yoghurt, and 45mins for the pancake. Still, good variety of food, desserts and drinks at reasonable prices. Would consider coming back if it's not too crowded.",

    "text": "Well well well.. Another Japanese french Fusion Restaurant. Along with the dolce tokyo, ma maison etc.... It seems like everyone one is trying to ride on the whole jap-french and now korean-french cafe/bakery.We've walked past this place plenty of times before, always wondering if it's worth a try and finally... We decided to give it a shot. First impression ...not too bad.... Place had the type of decor I liked, warm woods with metal and Edison bulbs. Menu is simple enough, pasta, rice and their renown souffl\u00e9s (which I unfortunately didn't get the chance to try). Instead, we went for a mixed seafood in squid ink rice, clam chowder and tried a matcha ice cream in iced matcha latte. First up, the clam chowder. First glance, nice presentation but chowder looks very light and \"liquidity\". Upon tasting, just as I expected, instant and mixed in with the bare minimum of what makes a clam chowder. I counted maybe 3 clams at most while the potatoes were still crunchy. I don't think I've ever had crunchy potatoes in a chowder before. Carrots were barely there and the entire chowder didn't taste so much a chowder as it did a plain soup. No distinct seafood or clam flavours. Next up came the matcha. The latte itself was decent enough while the ice cream was a little sweet eaten in its own. Mixed in with the matcha and it was much much better. Lastly, the rice. For once, a dish that looked very similar to its poster and menu. The Dish looked appetizing enough, with the rice nicely coated in squid ink and the egg they put on top looking extremely appetizing. Now I'm no expert in cooking, but, I do know that squid ink is very delicate. Over or undercook it and you'll be left with a pungent rancid after taste. Dish came with a decent portion of rice with about 4 pieces of squid, 3 shrimps (those peeled frozen ones you get at a supermarket) and 3 mini scallops (the kind you find on top of a sushi). Overall, it tastes really good. Well seasoned with the egg bringing balance and really tying the dish together. Now... I would have given this place a 4* rating based on the rice alone but 4 main factors hanged all that. 1) An underwhelming clam chowder 2) the sheer size and cost of the drink. It was $8.00 for something slightly bigger than a large tea cup. 3) the overall price of this place. 3 dishes for $40+ is not value for money and if I'm going to compare it to other places that serve me seafood in a pan than you're better off at fish and co or Manhattan fish market where you get a bigger bang for your buck.4) while leaving the place, a staff tried squeezing by me and banged into me accidentally. That's fine but a word of sorry would be nice. That's the problem with our service industry isn't it? Maybe my rating will increase once I try the popular souffl\u00e9s and french toast but until then, this place is forgettable.",

Every spoonful/ forkful of spaghetti yielded a different taste because of the different combination of ingredients. However, it still looked messy. Still, I'm all for trading aesthetics for taste. Light butter coating the spaghetti combined with saut\u00e9ed vegetables and sliced sausages, topped with an egg. It was definitely a satisfying meal, but until I've tried more of their offerings.... I wouldn't know, maybe this could have been the cherry on the cake?",

    "text": "Another Hoshino? Maybe? Maybe not. The Miam Miam Spaghetti was our favourite. \u00a0Like a typical Japanese wafu pasta, the cream is kept to a minimum or literally non existent. But when French butter, onion, shoyu and some secret broth is reduced in a right way and tossed with sausages, spinach and bacon, the dish \u00a0($16.80++) \u00a0turned out brilliant, better than it should be for what went into it. Interestingly, the Riz Noir ($16.50++) which resembled a Spanish squid ink paella, is made with Hokkaido's top grade ika sumi powder. The grains had a delectable firm chewy bites and garlicky flavour, though the scrambled eggs were far from the soft runny Japanese style omelette. Meanwhile, it was the opposite situation for the Souffle de Nuage ($17.50++); slightly clumpy glutinous rice-like tomato grains that are cleverly masqueraded beneath the golden and cheesy tasting whipped eggs. For the sweets, french toasts \u00a0($10.80++) with their irresistible buttery aroma are probably the best morning call one like to receive but these stiff, slightly dry brioche deprived of the moist eggy flavour seems to lack a bit of that charm.Matcha desserts such as matcha parfait \u00a0($11.80++) \u00a0or matcha souffle ($11.80++) are made with top grade matcha powder from Japan but unfortunately the taste did not come forth. However, the Varlhona chocolate souffl\u00e9 ($13.80++) was excellent. Though it did not rise tall and high as I imagined, this dense baked chocolate dessert has a delicious molten center achieved by precise execution of oven time and the bonus drizzle of chocolate sauce on top. Do place the order early as it takes up to 20-25 minutes to prepare.",

The real treats are the coffees and matcha (or chocolate) souffles and creme brulees -- Singaporeans know their desserts. #singapore-bugis-junction",

    "text": "When it comes to French Toast, the most talked about one currently has got to be Miam Miam. With all the raving going on, I had to check it out for myself and French toast for dinner is always a good idea in Ms Skinnyfat's food world.Miam Miam is a French-Japanese cafe and they serve the usual Fusion Japanese cafe stuff e.g. pasta, baked rice, souffl\u00e9, matcha latte and of course french toast. Knowing that they do not take reservations, we made it down early to the Bugis Junction outlet on a Friday evening and an empty restaurant welcomed us (but not for long).Drinks first, the Iced Matcha Latte with Softee ($8.80) was actually pretty decent. Great green tea flavor with a milky flavor, though I still prefer the intensity of Nana's Green Tea.Iced Earl Grey with Softtee ($6.80) was bleah. The tea was too weak and the softee lacked in the cream department. Take note that water is charged at 50 cents a cup.Gave the other savory dishes a try as well. The Riz Noir ($15.80) is a Squid Ink Black Rice and Scrambled Omu Egg. The portion was surprisingly small though. A rather disappointing dish that lacked in smokiness. The rice while moist was also on the salty end. Eggs were nicely done though.The Miam Miam Spaghetti ($15.80) was typically Japanese with a light savory sauce made from French butter, shoyu and some secret sauce. Well, looking at the ingredients (processed sausage, bacon, some vegetables and mushrooms and a soft boiled egg), it seemed like a randomly thrown together plate of home cooked noodles and indeed it tasted kinda like that as well. Not to say that it's not nice but i would expect better ingredients. If you are a fan of saucy food, then the Riz Au Curry ($15.50) would be for you. Sweetish rich Japanese curry with soft rice, minced meat (almost non-existent) pork sausages, broccoli cheese and egg. Everything kinda drowned in the curry. The flavor of the curry was alright but maybe just go easy on the sauce?Now the redeeming grace of Miam Miam would be their desserts and there are pancakes, souffles and parfaits. Honestly, there's one thing that you definitely should order and that's the French Toast.Disappointing mains aside, the French Toast ($9.80) was every bit as good as everyone promised. Soft fluffy brioche cubes that had the texture of clouds. They're paired with the thoroughly whipped heavy cream, it is close to clotted cream but lighter in taste (but sweeter) and texture. Absolutely delicious with the smoky maple syrup. I would have drenched the toast with it but there wasn't enough. Have this as a main course instead!Matcha Souffle ($10.80) was undercooked and very wet inside. The texture is that of whipped raw egg whites that are pandan flavored. I could hardly taste any matcha. The Chocolate Molleaux Dessert ($9.80) fared better with the rich chocolate taste though i found it on the cakey end. The softee was too icy and lacked in vanilla. That said, i wouldn't mind having this again.Conclusion, Miam Miam is better for its sweets. The mains will fill you up but you wouldn't be quite satisfied. Maybe the pasta is alright. I don't know. But as for me, i'll stick with the French Toast and Matcha Latte for now.",
