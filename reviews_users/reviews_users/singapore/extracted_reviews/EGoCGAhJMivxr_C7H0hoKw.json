    "text": "Amidst lanes of asian cuisine and hawker stalls, this American diner stands out with it's visual aesthetic. I'm always a sucker for buffalo wings so when I saw this on the menu, I decided to give this place a try. For starters, my dining buddy had the pork slider that was recommended to us by Cristine (I think she's the restaurant manager, I'm not exactly sure) and I had the 6 piece buffalo wings. We weren't exactly hungry so this was just an excuse to watch sports on the telly, have some male bonding time and kick back with some beers. On tap, Smokey's has a range of Archipelago beer. They offer the regular, the blanc and the dark. I'm not particularly fussy with beer so I went with the dark. If you're into wine. They offer a pretty large selection of bottled wine from Chilli, New Zealand and Oz. Being an American style diner, they had a whole fridge full of import bottled beers that range from $10 to $20 a bottle. You can choose to sit at the bar counter, indoors or outdoors under the big umbrella shades. The mains, which we didn't get a chance to try range from about $20- $30. My buffalo wings didn't disappoint and I wished that I had space for more. It has a nice atmosphere with friendly staff and it's a really good place to enjoy a warm day outside.",

Not only have they been overtaken in the taste and quality stakes by Naught Pigs in Tanjong Katong, but the quality and service has nose dived. Where to start.... the service is almost non-existent, even on a quiet night I was ignored when entering and had to move myself when it started to rain, they forgot my fiends order and we were ignored thereafter, to the extent that I had to stand up and wave a serviette to get someone's attention away from the game on the TV. The food is bland, bland, bland - the BBQ sauce is vinegary and dull, the ribs are minuscule, the fries were cold and the coleslaw was watery slop. The beers are OK and you can watch F1 or a game while you eat, which is probably not worth it these days because everyone seems to look at their mobile phones while they eat. Anyway, go there with mates for an average steak or ribs and to watch a match but don't go there for the food and be prepared to be ignored. If you mention the lack of service they will be sympathetic but are UNABLE to deduct it from the bill LOL - so just ask for a discount. My advice? Don't bother.",

Finally had to request some empty seats from a passing waiter which he mentioned was 'untaken'. The fact that nobody bothered to offer any seats to us despite passing us on the way to the kitchen was bewildering to say the least.At the end of the night, we had a shock when the bill was presented to us. We were informed at the point of order by the waitress serving us on the happy hour promo, which was in fact totally wrong information. We only found out when the bill came & we saw the prices. The waitress handling the bill went to get a senior person, presumably the manager, who could only say 'he can't help us' flatly without leaving room for any discussion. Would never return after this first trip there. Would give 0/5 stars if I could but it seems 1/5 was the minimum.",

The staff were very patient and attentive, and made several recommendations to us.I got the signature BBQ baby ribs and suffice to say that I was not disappointed in the least. The meat was very tender and had a distinct smoky flavor to it which I really liked. The baby ribs also came with coleslaw and steak cut fries, and I really liked the fries. The fries were very crispy on the outside and the inside was really soft and smooth. Near perfect fries.We also ordered a couple of beers, and they were good.Overall, this is a great place to have American BBQ at very reasonably prices, at a very comfortable place for a gathering.",

I enjoy sitting outside on a nice Singapore day. Pretty much everything on the menu is a good choice with one exception, their Pulled pork sandwich. I don't think they put enough sauce on it, it is too dry. I think they'd be better if they simply didn't just pour the sauce on top, but mixed the meat and then put on the bread. Their beer selection is decent, they've got a fair bit on tap which bumps up their rating. There is also a small craft brew store right next door. As a frequent patron, I'd make a couple more minor suggestions to make their services better. First off, their wait staff needs to be a little more attentive. Sometimes it is tough to get their attention and they don't come to the tables nearly as often as they should. And the second suggestion would be to provide more variety on the TVs. It seems that every time I'm there they either have Rugby or Soccer on the TV. I'm not opposed to those 2 sports, but this place fancies itself an \"American\" style restaurant. Americans watch Hockey, Football, Baseball, and Basketball, we seldom watch Rugby or Soccer unless were trying to blend in with UK/SG/Aussie crowd.",

    "text": "Friend from Tokyo was craving good ol' American eats and this place did not disappoint! We happened to dine on a Wednesday and much to our chagrin they have all day/night happy hour specials on Wednesdays, sweet! $1 wings, $6 pints. US prices! The brisket were outstanding and I felt a bit nostalgic with the huge California flag and TVs playing major league baseball. The best part: first place in Singapore I've seen carrying Lagunitas beer! My favorite IPA. Can't wait to come back the next time I'm craving BBQ.",

If you're willing to spend the money, as it is a bit pricey (more than you'd pay in the US), it's worth every bite. My fianc\u00e9 and I shared the St Louis ribs and the brisket. Loved everything about this place, from the patio seating, the rugby game playing, right down to the music in the bar.",

    "text": "A true American restaurant here in Singapore.I went here once over three years ago and loved it, life got in the way and I have not been back since, also because every time I think to come, it is a holiday or occasion and they have long since booked up. I made it back this past weekend and was not disappointed at all. It addresses my homesickness in two categories, unlimited Diet Coke refills, not skunky cans, but soda guns, and good mozzarella sticks. But there is more to this place than soda and deep fried bar snacks, the barbeque is great, real smoked meats with a great flavour. This is not the kind of place that sets out a six pack of sauces to cover your meals with, they just have one good tangy barbeque sauce they use to accent the smoked meat flavour. We did also order the chili, which had a good taste, but might be a stretch to call chili, it was shredded beef, with a sauce and a lot of melted cheese on top along with sour cream and (I think) pickles. One important fact to keep in mind about both of these dishes, Barbecue and Chili are hotly debated US dishes, depending on the region and the proper preparation method, so take my review for what it is worth and don't argue with me about direct or indirect, dry or sauce, spaghetti, beer or beans. I'm just telling you what they serve and that I enjoyed the result, but do acknowledge there are many different ways to go about it. The atmosphere is nice, all open air, but comfortable inside with lots of fans and the recently completed construction next door has I'm sure improved the dining experience. I'd highly recommend this place and intend to plan better and be back before another three years passes.",

I don't even eat much meat and usually have the salmon options but I'm still really impressed with those and the quality of the fries and salads. You rarely see good cuts of meat in Singapore so it's you're a frustrated carnivore this will be soul food for you. One detail that has made this slip from a 5 to a 4 star rating is ambiance. It used to be all non-smoking (which is how it would be in the US, and we were overjoyed to find a smoke free patio) but that was different last time we were in. The patio began to really fill with smoke just as we finished dinner and we decided to flee rather than stay for dessert. You can go and smoke your brains out like it's 1975 anywhere in Singapore, I really don't think this place needed to stoop to that to keep people coming in.",
