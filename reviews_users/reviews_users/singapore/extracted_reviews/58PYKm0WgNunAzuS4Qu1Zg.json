    "text": "Lagnaa tops little india for me in terms of concept. They are all about chilies and spices where you can choose the level of spice that you would like to consume over there. There are up to 10 levels of spice and the highest level anyone has ever achieved is 9. You have to progress your way up the spice ladder whereby you can start at level 6 and only once that is complete, can you go up to level 7 and so forth. These challenges can only take place on a full moon. You even have to put a little clip on the wall and write your name after you successfully complete a spice challenge. Can you think of a restaurant with a more unique concept? They have an incredible egg plant dish named kathiri pachadi that i would highly recommend.",

She even took some pictures and mailed them to us afterwards. very nice!Food quality was very good, the highlight for me personally was the different types of Nan, which I never have had before. Rest of the food was also good, comparable to other good Indian restaurants I've already been.All of us really enjoyed this experience and we left the restaurant satisfied. Highly recommendable if you seek for a good Indian Restaurant in Little India.",

The walls out front of the restaurant have the scribbles of many a satisfied customer, and we weer all encouraged to leave out mar as well! The first floor has tables and chairs for those who aren't used to sitting on the floor, but as we had no problems with it, we took off our shoes and went upstairs for the barefoot dining experience.The upstairs is air-conditioned and clean, with several small tables and cushions on the ground. It's a rather intimate and authentic experience with ambient indian music playing in the background.We waited a very long time for the food - at least 30 minutes. Whilst waiting, they served up papadoms with a delicious mint chutney as appetizers. Our food finally arrived, and it was definitely worth the wait. The portions are somewhat small, so it's great for a small group of friends to order different items to share. It is also ideal for couples.The yoghurt rice was fragrant and had a wonderful texture to it. It really whetted my appetite and was perfect \u00a0for eating curries with. The chicken biryani, likewise, was an instant favourite amongst us, brimming with amazing flavours from the numerous spices used. I found the prices a bit steep here, but for a treat every once in a while, it's definitely worth your money to come to Lagnaa.",

So, I thought, why not? When I went, it was really empty thought - and I ate upstairs - and we were the only ones.What I Love: They have an interesting menu. Then, they had a seafood cheese fondue thing - which was pretty cool. And their breads were nice and yummmy. The upstairs part is barefoot dining and it is pretty cosy and has a good feel to it. It's a good spot to have a different kind of dining experience.What I Didn't Love: Their prices were wayyy wayy wayyy wayyy wayy off. Thought it was wayyy too steep for me. It came up to $100 just for 2 people? And when I asked them, they said the fondue is pretty much the reason. It's just melted cheese! And the service was kinda slow.",

We ordered a \"large\" butter chicken (which was recommended by the chef), a basmati rice, and two naans. Took about 30 min to get the food, which is not a problem at all. The large portion was a bowl, with a lot of sauce and not so much chicken. The meat was incredibly tender, you could see they knew how to cook - but honestly small and a bit underwhelming to cost 24 dollars. We spent 68 dollars on our meal, probably could have been half the price in a different location in the neighborhood, for the same (or perhaps) better flavor.",

They also have toddler friendly dishes that have absolutely no spice. This was awesome for us because all of the other places would say no spice but would still be too hot for our girl.

I'm personally a fan of the open air simple feel, so downstairs is cool, but they also have lovely accommodations upstairs for fine evening dining.

I wasn't sure so played it safe with a '2' (10 is the hottest) and by god a 2 was hot enough for me!! Be warned!It was tasty though, and not so hot the flavour was lost. We shared a couple of naan and some rice between us and overall it was pretty good food, not the biggest portions mind you but that was fine given the heat of the food and the temperature outside.Not the cheapest place, but the service helps soften the blow of the bill.

Never ever have I paid $ 15-20 for 2-3 pieces of meat in a small bowl of curry3. Mediocre food: chicken curry was the only decent dish - the spice level was inconsistent throughout each dish we got. We got level 4, but the prawn masala was more like 7-8 and was inedible quite frankly 4. Water is a self serviced item- funny enough you have to fetch water from the \"pantry\" which is also marked as a washroom. This was really odd to all of us. 5. The hostess or the owner kept trying to sell us more pappadoms for $15 - with 3 chutneys. I have never paid this much money for any pappadoms! 6.

However, this restaurant is such a tourist trap and should totally be skipped! This restaurant engages in two distinct practices that triggered tourist trap warning bells in my head from the moment I sat down (a sensation that I found negatively detracted from my dining experience):1. There is definite baiting to get you to spend on add-ons. First, the waiter refused to give us the menu until we placed a drink order. Second, the poppadom that is put on your table is an extra charge. Sketchy sketchy! 2. It is really really challenging to figure out how much your meal will be based on reading the menus. The curries themselves are small portions but priced between $15-$20. This would be fine except that drinks, rice, naan, and whatever else you want are all additional add on! By the time you order all of your sides, you've tacked on an additional $5-$10. But wait, there is more! In order to calculate your full bill, be sure to include the $1.50 poppadom and 10% service charge....honestly, it's enough to make your head dizzy. As for the food/experience, there are so many more authentic Indian restaurants in the area that will charge you more reasonable prices (I have never even paid HALF of what I paid at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining). If you are too picky to try some of the more authentic local offerings and are blessed with a blind eye towards price, then this is certainly a place for you to go \"test your spice tolerance!!!\". However, if you just care about having an authentic experiences in Singapore, do yourself a favor and skip this restaurant!I am really disappointed that such publications as The Washington Post and Lonely Planet so highly recommend this location. My meal at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining was certainly one of those experiences that reminded me to always read travel guides with a critical eye.",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner with a friend at Lagnaa Barefoot Dining. \u00a0This restaurant was one of my first restaurants on my Singapore dining wish-list. \u00a0Before I had even moved to Singapore, I had be told about it.We chose to sit downstairs. \u00a0So, we did not actually have the barefoot dining experience.What you do get seating downstairs is the feeling that you are being cooked for in someone's home. \u00a0The staff is so friendly.Plus, from my seat, I could see K7 (the chef - and no before this dining experience - i did not know him) cooking in the kitchen. \u00a0I witnessed an outpouring of love for creating amazing food. \u00a0He was also quite the gracious host. \u00a0The hostess was also extremely friendly and treated us as if we were long lost friends.I could laboriously work through detailing all of the food. \u00a0But, for this one, I am mainly going to sum it up. \u00a0It ranged from very good to excellent. \u00a0We did not really challenge the heat scale. \u00a0My dining companion for the evening does not really enjoy extremely spicy foods. \u00a0So, with her in mind, we kept two dishes at level 1 and, for me to sample, we had one dish at level 3.I found the dishes all to be wonderfully prepared. \u00a0I did not find the level 3 to be very intimidating. \u00a0On my next visit, I will work in a level 4 dish and see how I manage with that.Wheel of delicious food:tinyurl.com/bm5bbd4My plate:tinyurl.com/c88wmbgI will say that I did truly enjoy the vegetable pakoras; mmm, yummy crispy goodness.tinyurl.com/c9cmzs8The garlic naan was also a home-run. \u00a0It was so fresh. \u00a0It did not have even a touch of that rubberiness than can sneak in and ruin a naan. \u00a0The garlic flavor was just right. \u00a0It was distinct without being overpowering.tinyurl.com/bvfwhboOverall, the food was very-very good. \u00a0But, for me, what made the dining experience truly five star was the warmth of the staff. \u00a0I will certainly return.",

    "text": "a gimmicky, very-expensive indian restaurant in little india - not the traditional indian foodery as you'd expect in this neighborhood. it seems catered toward tourists, tripadvisor (on which it has a fantastic rating) and unknowing diners a like - the gimmick of barefoot dining and variable heat levels (and of course that means there's a barely-human level up there) saying possibly everything you need to know.but I'm cynical.we started with some delicate chickpea fritters dotted with peas - I didn't think they would be, but these browned small things had loosely-bound chickpea meal and bits of peas strewn throughout. pretty delicious.for mains, we had a round of different curries and stew-like things of varying heat - and let me tell you that the third heat level pretty much packs a punch. I also can't name all of what we were eating as they were just rather spicy, spice-y things that tasted decent (but how could it not, with that many aromatics) but a spicy chickpea curry had tender legumes and the raita was cool and delicious.I don't remember anything fantastic about the chicken tikka - and I think it pretty pricey, so I would stick to the curries. get some naan to go with too, as they were delicious (and so was my roti).in any case, the food was decent. I have no qualms except that it was more expensive than expected (and warranted), and it may not be the sort of thing you expected in little india. decent otherwise, and maybe a good place for out-of-towners.",

The mango juice was extra refreshing in the heat. To top off the tasty meal the service was perfect. What welcoming and pleasant people.",

It was pouring and parking was as bad as it gets in Little India. ...but we persevered and fimally reached Lagnaa Barefoot Dining. The ambience was magnificent so was the food. Loved all the curry dishes and the naans. It helped that the manager(owner?) came to explain to us the menu and made some good recommendations. Overall, it was a very fulfilling meal for all of us. Will be coming again.",

    "text": "Tiny fun-sized portions. Mediocre taste. Poor inattentive service. Inflated and overpriced, even by Singapore standards. What more can I say about this terrible place? I was taken there by a friend. The portions were so small that they were able to place all five dishes (of mostly vegetables and just one meat) we ordered onto a gimmicky single round plate no larger than a single serving plate you use in buffets (meant to be shared among four people mind you). Even though the dishes had to be shared, the owner and waitress did not offer serving spoons to us. The taste was extremely mediocre. I've had much better Indian food in the US (Midwest) and Australia (Perth). They didn't even have fragrant basmati rice. Their rice tasted like overnight bad bran. I spent the same amount at two proper Indian restaurants in the same area where I had great tasting dishes of fish, chicken, and seafood (at those other restaurants, not here). It was one of the worst meals I have ever had in Singapore. When I was there, I wondered how the place even survives in Singapore and then I took a look around and knew why. Most of the diners were westerners, which is the only reason this rip-off place has repeat customers, because the only way such a place can maintain a following is by hoodwinking people who are new in town and who fall prey for mindless gimmicks like \"dining-barefoot\" easily. You can also tell from the reviewers in this website that most of the diners (and people who view the place favorably) are westerners who had just moved in to town and obviously are primed for being \"chopped\". This place would close down in a week in the US. Many restaurants in Singapore get away with serving average food and charging a high price in spite of it, because of the high density of Singapore. There are always more unsuspecting or willing diners who need to eat out, no matter how lousy you are. So restaurants just need to be very average. That's why the food standard here is relatively low. But most people here wouldn't understand it until they have lived abroad.",

She urged us to try the upstairs barefoot dining... uh, yes please! \u00a0Sounds fun!The interior of the upstairs is ultra minimal, just a few low tables with pillows to sit on and some lanterns for atmosphere. \u00a0It was filled with young expats, mostly from the UK from what I could tell from their accents. \u00a0We ordered the chicken masala, palak paneer, garlic naan and some rice. \u00a0The hostess suggested we keep the spice level around a 1.5 or a 2. \u00a0Having eaten quite a bit of Indian food but not feeling like having a super spicy meal, we went with the 2. \u00a0HOLY COW was it spicy! \u00a0So much so it kind of took away from our enjoyment of the food.It was pretty pricey but a fun experience. \u00a0Definitely kind of more of a tourist trap type place than for locals, but worth trying.",
