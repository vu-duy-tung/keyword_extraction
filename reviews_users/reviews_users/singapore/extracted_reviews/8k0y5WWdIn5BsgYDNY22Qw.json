    "text": "Impeccable service and delicious food. Roland and his team elevate the Singapore seafood dining experience. Conveniently located on the East Coast on the top floor of the parking garage next to the Marine Parade NTUC Fair Price, dine on local favourites like chili and pepper crab, crunchy baby squid and stuffed dough sticks (yew char kway). First, the nosh. I enjoyed the flavourful boiled peanuts with black bean and sesame tones offered instead of the usual roasted kachang (roasted peanuts). They asked if we wanted tea. (Tip: They do not have chrysanthemum tea.) We decided to stay with water instead. They brought out an extensive menu filled with Chinese seafood dishes that I grew up with when I used to visit Seafood Road on East Coast Road (Long Beach, Palm Beach, Redhouse, nearby Golden Lion). I was transported back in time. They have lovely pictures in the menu that helped with my decision-making process. We ordered two large male crabs: chili crab and pepper crab, market price was $72 per kilogram. It was more than $10 less that the market price at restaurants at the East Coast Seafood Center. The chili crab sauce was to die for. We sopped it up with fried and steamed mantou (slightly sweet bread). The black pepper crab was tasty. The crab meat was sweet and tender, but I have had crab that was fatter and more meat. However, it could've been a seasonal thing. They might've just finished moulting. \u00a0The fried baby squid was heavenly. These half inch long morsels are sweet and savouring, serving up a distinct flavour and crunch. I felt sad that I didn't eat another plateful. Try it with a red chili sauce. Sweet and heat, Bobby Flay would've been proud.Another dish that had the sweet and heat thing going on was the fish paste stuffed fried dough stick (stuffed yew char kway). These come out hot and crispy. The fish paste was delicious. Dip it into the sweet flour and chili sauce that was hmmm, so good. My daughter licked it clean. They'd probably given us more sauce of we'd asked.Our last course was fried rice with tiny silver fish and crab. This dish was full of texture. I loved the crispiness of the fried fish that made the dish pop. I thought the crab was a little lost in the dish, but I enjoyed two bowls of it. I enjoyed eating it was a lightly seasoned plate of kailan greens.Just went I thought I could eat no more, they brought out orh nee, a traditional Teochew dessert or sweet taro paste. Unlike other orh nees that is sticky and oily, Roland's rendition is lighter and smoother, still maintaining its characteristic sweetness and slightly floral notes. My daughter enjoyed the light mango pudding with pomelo. That capped the evening on the highest note. It is one of the loveliest mango concoctions I have ever tasted. My daughter shyly asked for another round.While thinking about the food again makes me salivate, what sets Roland's apart is their service. When we made inquiries about the menu, the staff were friendly and hospitable, taking the time to go to the kitchen to answer our questions. When we made our reservations over the phone, they continued their extend their warm hospitality. Upon arrival, the maitre d' had our reservation on her list, then ushered us to a beautifully set smaller round tables. Roland's is a fantastic place to hold a banquet. The beautiful dining room is beautifully decorated with mirrors and lit low. The lights in the tanks added ambiance. Also, the restaurant is quieter than typical Chinese restaurants and conducive to conversations. The waitstaff were so attentive throughout the meal that I almost felt like I was at a French restaurant. Okay, I exaggerate a little, but still, they were super attentive and accommodating. It was a little surreal to be attended so closely while peeling and sucking on crab shells at the same time. However, I got over it very quickly. We couldn't finish our orh nee, and the wait staff quickly offered to package it home in a doggie bag for us. We all enjoyed our dining experience.Try Roland's for classy and comfortable way to enjoy Singapore seafood!",

    "text": "Singapore is know for many things, chili crab being one! Roland is a Singapore institution that is popular amongst the locals.As others have said, compared to other places, Roland's crab is more \"spicy\" than sweet, catering to a more authentic taste than other places that tend to have more of a tourist crowd. That said, I really enjoyed the chili crab and the group I was with ordered another!The atmosphere is nice - it's not overdone and you feel that you're in a \"Chili Crab\"/Asian restaurant rather than some tourist joint. it's hard to describe, but once you look at the photos you'll understand. It has a really strong family vibe and, if you come late enough, you might be lucky to hear terrible Cantonese/Mandarin karaoke next door which only makes the experience feel more authentic!English is a bit hit and miss with some of the staff but it's manageable.",

    "text": "I have always wanted to try the Chilli crab that started all Chilli crabs but no chance till now! My best friends returned home from overseas and demanded to fulfill their Chilli crabs need. So I suggested to try Roland Restaurant, I mean they DID claim that they are the originator!! As the star dish of the night, I must say that their Chilli crab is indeed better than most I have eaten. This is because many restaurants cater to foreigners' taste buds and scale down their Chilli-ness to tomato sweet. Their sauce is thick with a hint of tomato sweet and yet still packed with even Chilli punch! Awesome!!!! The crabs themselves were fresh and meat was juicy and firm. Another star of the night has to be the Salted Egg Crab with yam. It's really salted egg sauce that's fried into the crab and they tossed in some yam fritters to give the dish extra crispiness, crunch and flavor!!! We had many other dishes and all beautifully done. As my best friend said at the end of the meal, \"Roland knows how to do it right\". The meal is not cheap but we had Sea Bass and drunken prawns and Broccoli with Scallops so it's rather worth the cost. Definitely bringing my family to try.",

    "text": "Roland is the FOUNDER of Singapore's famous Chilli Crab. It's hard to imagine that this is indeed the case when you have other more known establishments such as Jumbo Restaurant, No Signboard Seafood, and Long Beach Seafood spread across the Red Dot. Make no mistake about it, however, this is one of the BEST places to grab Chilli Crab in Singapore. Located on top of a parking lot!?!? This is where the locals, particularly those who live in the East, get their Chilli crab. In terms of the Chilli Crab itself, I'll second what a fellow Yelper said in her review. Roland delivers a Chilli Crab that is more chilli than sweet, the way it ought to be done. Many restaurants cook their Chilli Crab in order to cater to a foreigners' sweet tooth (ahem, Jumbo). I wouldn't say the dish is spicy, but it did have some kick resulting a little bit of sweat coming down my forehead. :DThe other dishes were solid. The Baby Kai Lan was absolutely delicious, while the Seafood Food Fried Rice came up way short (I wasn't a big fan of the crunchy like topping they sprinkled on the Fried Rice).Overall, if you are a big fan of Chilli Crab, Roland is a must try!",
