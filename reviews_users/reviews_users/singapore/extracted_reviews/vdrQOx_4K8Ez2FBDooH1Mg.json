    "text": "After craving an authentic bowl of pho for weeks, \u00a0I funnily got distracted by the grilled chicken noodles. After a a guided tour through the botanic gardens rainforest (recomemded), I figured a cold noodle salad would hit the spot and cool me down. When it arrived, \u00a0it was presented well with pickled carrot radish and cabbage and shredded fresh lettuce. I pulled out the spring rolls to keep them from getting soggy. They tasted weird, \u00a0like nothing I have ever tasted before, so I abandoned them. The grilled chicken was really quite tasty, \u00a0tender and juicy. The sauce was also nice with plenty of lemon, \u00a0I poured the whole bowl in as the noodles had already clumped together. I mixed thoroughly and took my first mouthful. What a shock! The noodles were hot! This totally overpowered the sauce and became quickly disappointing. If I hadn't expected a cold dish I might have been quite content. The lemongrass tea tastes fine on the first sip, \u00a0but as the ice melts becomes very dilute very quickly. Certainly nothing to write home about, \u00a0but passable for a decent meal in air conditioned comfort.",
