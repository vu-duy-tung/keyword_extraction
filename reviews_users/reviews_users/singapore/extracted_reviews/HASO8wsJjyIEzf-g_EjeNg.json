I want to marry the person making this delicious bowl of heaven!!!!! ( note to my dear husband who might stumble upon my review one day - 'relax \u00a0I'm just kidding - ish')The Mee Siam is piquantly sweet , spicy , soury all at once. When it hits your tastebuds there are firework like \u00a0explosions of flavor ! Pop rocks move aside!No no no no no I can't believe I'm living million of miles away from this place ... I'd move back \u00a0to Singapore just for this! This place also makes kick ass popiah . I should know I only ate 3 rolls of it every other day for 1 year ! Hehehehe",

The chili is very spicy. Beware. The laksa is very lemak (coconutty) and the mee siam is pretty spicy on its own.Oooh...and the bandung is made the traditional way with lots of evaporated milk, unlike those served in coffee shop now.",

    "text": "Love this small but cozy cafe setting at a corner of Coronation Plaza (2nd floor). I do not really know since when my family and I love coming to this place but we have definitely come here for awhile now.What to order from here? Mee Rebus and popiah are my two favorite dishes here. I enjoy eating the Mee Rebus sauce as it has a tangy feeling after you eat it. The portion wise is not big but for it's price (less than $5), it was worth it. I think I prefer the Mee Rebus here than to other \"toast\" chains. For the popiah, you might need to wait awhile before being serve. The wait gets crazy over the weekend as a lot of people seemed to only like their popiah instead of their local delicacies. For the popiah, like many newspaper articles had mentioned, it is one of the best. The ingredients made the whole popiah to be fragrant and not soggy. Depending on your tastebuds, a hint of chili sauce might increase the tastiness of the popiah itself. The price was also reasonable.If you would like to avoid the crowds, do not come during peak hours (lunch time) or weekends. The seating for this place was limited and you might need to share tables with other customers if you come alone.Another suggestion is that instead of take aways, consume it fresh (as in dining in). It definitely has different taste if you consume it straightaway or ten to fifteen minutes later. Will definitely continue to support this place. It is definitely a hidden gem in the midst of cafes along the Bukit Timah stretch.",

    "text": "Most people would only visit My Cosy Corner for their popiah or kueh pie ti, or else a rather average but budget Japanese rice bowl. Their popiah isn't even very cheap at $2.20, but there's no doubt that they know what they are selling, and also no wonder their popularity for it. It's main filing is a simple turnip and carrot combination, not the massive filigree of vegetables and ingredients, yet it works a treat. My favourite part of their popiah is its texture: a few other ingredients added to the mix also gives it a very nice crisp in every bite, yet the skin is soft so the filling is always fighting to break free.I haven't had anything else memorable here. My only other memory here is how rude the Uncle running the shop can be, but as a whole they do genuinely seem nicer to frequent customers, so if you think the popiah is worth coming back to, it may be worth starting to make friends too.",

    "text": "The name cozy corner is a misnomer- the shop is tucked away in a dusty corner of Coronation Plaza yes, but it is the furthest thing from 'cozy'. Its been around for as long as I can remember- and serves one of the best popiahs I have ever had. The radish in their popiahs are cooked to perfection- soft, tasty and appetizing. They also throw in a bunch of magic ingredients that I cant really tell- but there is something in their popiah that gives it an extra crunch (could be lard- so sinful but I don't care). One sells for $2.20 which is pretty expensive, but looking at the queue I don't think price is a factor when the fanatics are queuing for this popiah. Sometimes the popiah is made by the aunty, sometimes the uncle, it doesn't really matter because they are equally good.Their other dishes are also not too bad, but pretty expensive. I remember their Japanese food selling for as much as sushi tei's, but I really didn't like my tempura udon. The tempura was fried chinese-style- weird, heavy batter and the udon was overcooked. I also sometimes have the meesiam which I quite enjoy- tangy and spicy at the same time. The store is also very 'spiritual', and plays church music like hillsongs. I don't really have an opinion on it because it doesn't really bother me. What bothers me more is that sometimes the aunty gets really grumpy when she's busy though in a harmless way.",

I'm glad that 'little nonya' wave has passed and it's not trendy to wanna be peranakan.This little kiosk style establishment in the corner of Coronation Plaza makes really good popiah and kueh pie tee. A must try if you're in the area. As you can tell, I tend to say 'it's worth a try, if you're in the area.'... I'm not a big fan of traveling up and down the island just to eat. Some foodie I am. This was a favourite snack place of mine in secondary school, I studied on the Bukit Timah belt (yes, yes, I'm a genius). Student discounts are extended to all students!",

It might be a little spicy for those who can't take their chili.I'd go here for their oyaku don as well. It tastes alright for the price. The ramen and udon and pretty much all the other dishes are pretty meh, though. Also, there's always a shortage of seats, so you might have to end up taking away the food or (if you're a student) sit on the floor.",

This was the place I used to frequent often after school with friends that stayed in the area. The small cramp sitting area makes its well \"cosy\" I guess. I still visit this store every now and then for a trip down memory lane plus its probably one of the stores in coronation plaza that sells food. The rest of the stores include barbers, school uniform retailers and the occasional odd shops selling a multitude of random things!",
