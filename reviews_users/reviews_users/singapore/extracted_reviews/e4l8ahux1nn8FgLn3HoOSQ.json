That aside, we almost ordered 4 glasses of water (at 0.30sgd each) because he didn't inform us of the cost until we asked.You pay up front. \u00a0So pretty much all self service except for utensils, drinks, and food. \u00a0Hence, my problem with the forced 10% service charge...",

    "text": "We dropped in for dinner after visiting the GV movie theater upstairs. It was late in the afternoon on a Sunday and the place was not busy. I guess the business model is to be slightly upscale Indonesian and Thai cuisine. We ordered the Thai basil chicken wrap, a Tom Yam seafood soup and a green curry with chicken. This was washed down with a couple of their juices. Service was quite quick although not particularly friendly. The food was OK although the lettuce leaves were all to small to make up the chicken wraps. The seafood in the Tom Yam was a little too chewy for our tastes. The green curry was ok, but to be honest none of the food had great flavor and despite the prices being a little higher than the more common Thai restaurant seen in many Singapore Malls, I cannot say that the food quality merited the higher prices. In conclusion, this is not really worth going out of your way for.",

    "text": "Had a craving for sour and spicy food one evening, so Bali Thai it was. We were met by friendly waitstaff who recommended dishes to us, so much so that we changed our orders to her suggestions! Tom yam soup extra spicy, pad Thai, stuffed chicken wings and eggplant fried with minced chicken and basil.Granted, this isn't the most authentic of joints and short of jetting off to Thailand, I just have to suck it up. They weren't kidding when I requested for extra spicy, and we were left sniffling after. Pad Thai was ok, but on the dry side. I'd give my left arm for the road side pad Thai vendors at Khao San road... Sniff! Stuffed chicken wing was moist, though mine still retained a touch if pink in the centre. I ate it anyway. Eggplant wasn't too memorable, and tasted strangely Chinese, if you get my drift.The Thai iced teas were mouth puckeringly sweet though, so you might want to request for \"siew dai\" to avoid a sugar induced coma.",

    "text": "I think I went to a different restaurant to the other reviewers, I thought this place was complete crap. The service was atrocious, you could tell it was going to be bad by the gormless idiot to attempted to serve us. The place was almost empty, hardly surprising really, we waited ages to be attended, one of the main courses turned up at the same time as the starter, it looked absolutely nothing like the image on the menu - the menu shows a pot full of colour, texture, seafood......what you actually got was a pot of slop. The food is bland, tasteless and ridiculously expensive for a third rate eating house in a shopping mall. Avoid at all costs, if you want good asian food, there are so many other places to choose from. There were 4 of us eating, one of us was sick before she left the mall, another still has a tummy bug.....awful awful, awful......",

    "text": "As its name suggests, Bali Thai offers a unique fusion Balinese and Thai cuisines. The setting is slick and contemporary, with modern Thai and Balinese d\u00e9cor along with plastic chairs. The restaurant serves Thai dishes such as Thai Fish Cakes, Seafood Tom Yum Soup, Phad Thai, Pineapple Rice and Mango Sticky Rice, and Indonesian dishes like Tahu Telur, Chicken Paggang and Fried Red Snapper. The Tom Yum soup did not taste authentic enough, as it had a sweeter hint to it than usual. Dry and slightly bland, the Chicken Paggang was disappointing as well. The only dish I was all right with was the Phad Thai, and even so, it was not great. \u00a0I guess I would drop by a restaurant that specializes in each separate cuisine the next time I have cravings for Thai or Indonesian food, as it seems more authentic and reliable.",
