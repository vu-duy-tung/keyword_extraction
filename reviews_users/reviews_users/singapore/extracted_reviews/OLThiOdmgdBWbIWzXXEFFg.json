    "text": "Such an adorable little gem that I'm glad we made the trek out to! This cafe serves modern European fare with an extensive craft beer menu. It's quite small and cosy with maybe 10~ or so small tables, and a nice, quiet intimate atmosphere. The bf had the schnitzel which was delicious!! I loved his mashed potatoes that came with it. I had the mussels stew, which was pretty good too, and generous. We shared a sweet fruity beer- I'm always so glad when restaurants have fruity beers or ciders. It's more inconvenient though as its only near a bus stop and quite a distance from other MRT stations like Marymount, as some other reviewers mentioned. We parked nearby after driving from Marymount, and almost couldn't find the place too! So glad we ate here.",

    "text": "First of all I would definitely come back to this little cafe in Thomson even though it is relatively far away from where I stay. My friend and I came about 11:50am and they were just about to get ready to open. At 12, they open their doors and welcomed us in. The place looked a little old but had some kind of relaxed feeling which I likedTook our orders, my friend had the chicken wrap while I had the first thing that was on the main course which was chicken schnitzel and we shared their curried fries as well. The food came promptly since there was no other customers, but the servings were really large and tasty. It was really good. \u00a0The waiter working there was friendly as well and its definitely a place for people to come down and have a long comfortable chat with one another while enjoying good food.For those driving, I would recommend parking at Thomson Plaza and then walking over to the cafe. Its about 2mins walk from Thomson Plaza.",

    "text": "It's not everyday I get to find a new place to get drunk in and it deserves 5 stars just for its selection of beers alone!The food was good, but unremarkable. The only exception: the fish and chips wasn't good at all. The buffalo wings came in really small portions but tasted decent.The best part, to me at least, is the beers they have. I'm not going to spoil the surprise, but if you like craft beer you should definitely visit!Getting here is tough. The nearest MRT is Marymount, I think, and it's quite a walk. The best way is still to drive, but then you'll be faced with the task of finding a parking lot.",

    "text": "A cute little chill place that's in some ulu place in Thompson - really difficult to get to it if you're not driving! This place was on my friend's 'List of Cafes to Visit' so we made a trip there to celebrate her birthday. Cute fact is that this cafe is right beside Jupiter and Venus Lanes - talk about out of world experiences! Not many patrons in the afternoon, which made it the ideal spot to chat with friends without worrying about hogging seats. Food was just slightly above average, but really yummy Curry Fries! A nice refreshing change from the usual chilli and/or cheese fries. They seem to specialize in Ciders, but it didn't seem appropriate at 3 in the afternoon, so we opted for Marshmallow Hot Chocolate instead. HUGE mugs of sweet warm fluffiness - plus it was raining a storm that afternoon! Couldn't ask for a better ambience for a cozy gathering!",

    "text": "Set in the increasingly popular stretch of Upper Thomson Rd that starts from just after Marymount MRT to before Ang Mo Kio Ave 1, yet another lovely caf\u00e9 has sprung up in the past year or so, lending a touch of much-needed youth to this tired sleepy neighbourhood.I was looking for that after-dinner snack (or dinner part 2) and didn't't feel like roughing it out at a roadside Indian-Muslim restaurant, so Little Part 1 Cafe's fit the bill! Staying open till the call of midnight on Fridays and Saturdays and serving a toothsome Hot Chocolate ($6.50) and the oddly scrumptious Belgian Fish Stew ($21.90). Coming off as what could be an intimidating stage school with their spotlights dangling from their fa\u00e7ade, Little Part 1's worlds apart once you step right in - cosy and oozing homeliness with their d\u00e9cor which combines Parisian, 60s American pop culture sensibilities and even strikes some as a struggling artist's artfully ornamented common room.",

Their little shop is AMAZING, it is decorated with lots of photo frames and vintage paraphernalia and has this collection of old books and games like old maid and saboteur (love that game). The food is nice. I luvvvvv the mussel stew, salmon crepe and the apple pie is FIRST-CLASS! Served with a dollop of vanilla ice-cream, it's total yums.",

    "text": "Little Part 1 is very aptly a backyard garden tucked away in the Thompson Estate with loads of ardent supporters.The last time I went, I ordered a Strawberry Lemonade. It was tart and sweet, and just the thing to cure a parched throat. On the other hand, our friend has a Caramel Latte so you know you can get your usual fixes at this spot. This, plus a wide variety of beers, which might interest most of you.The Belgian Fish & Mussels Stew came with a generous serving of mussels, tenderly cooked fish slices and a side of thick-cut fries. The Salmon Crepe has marinated salmon, onions, mushroom and mozzarella in it. Pretty much favorites in a crepe, so this is an easy winner though we thought the citrus dressing probably needed a revamp.Very cozy spot, you'll love this one.",

    "text": "Little Part One is one of those places you'd only know about by the word of mouth, because it's tucked away in a little corner along Upper Thomson Road next to Thomson Plaza that is easy to miss. It's a gem with remarkable tenacity - it has been open for more at least five years now, which is a feat considering the short lifespans of other non-hawker eateries along the road.I usually come here for a cosy dinner and a bottle of beer. The food here is not remarkable but decent enough, some items I have ordered are the Curry Fries (absolutely delicious), Shepherd's Pie (not bad), Chicken Schnitzel (good) and Pomodoro Chicken Wrap (average). You can choose your poison of choice from the wide selection of beers and ciders. On my last visit, a friend ordered a new cider they had just brought in (can't remember the name but it was strawberry flavoured) and it was good, not overly sweet like most other fruit ciders. My only gripe is that the prices of the food is a bit more expensive than what I would pay for at such a location. The vibe here is very laid-back and non-pretentious, and feels a bit like a backpacker's cafe with a shelf of travel guides and memorabilia from a number of countries.",

    "text": "This is a cozy little cafe at Thomson Road and reminds me a little of my backpacking days in Europe. I guess it's the travel books, variety of beer and casual vibe of the place. We had the pomodoro chicken, spinach and cheese crepe and shared some wholegrain mustard buffalo wings. You can't go wrong with a freshly made crepe. This tasted good but did not wow. The crepe was light and crisp on the outside, so that was good but the filling was just OK for me. Would have appreciated more chicken in the crepe. Further, before ordering, I had asked the server if there was sauce in the crepe. She said that there was \"tomato\" in the crepe which I understood to mean \"tomato sauce\" given my question . Turns out, there was no sauce, but tomatoes. Fine with me, since I wouldn't have wanted sauce in any case. It would have been nice if the cafe had a choice of batter for the crepe - e.g. wholewheat etc.The wholegrain mustard buffalo wings were good. For the price of the can drinks at $3, I would have expected them to be chilled. Maybe I'm picky, but a warm can of coke, even when poured into ice, tastes different from a chilled can of coke. It's less gassy. Also, do make reservations as I was turned down once when the place was packed for dinner.",
