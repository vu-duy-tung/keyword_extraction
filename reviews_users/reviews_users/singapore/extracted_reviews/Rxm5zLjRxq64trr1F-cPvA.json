    "text": "I remember the first time my dad took us to The Ship in Penang! It was really in a ship and there's a unique charm about dining in a ship with English style cooking. We don't exactly have a ship in middle of the city but \u00a0the ambience is enough to bring back those memories. The food also follows the traditional English style starting with soup and bread with butter. We had pumpkin soup today which was yummy. We ordered the lobster special with grilled pork chop served with potatoes and vegetables. The lobster was excellent, we will definitely order the whole lobster next time. The pork chop although not the juiciest I've tasted, was nicely seasoned. The potatoes! I don't usually comment about sides but the potatoes were good and for the vegetables you have steamed carrots and broccoli, buttered and lightly salted, again very satisfying traditional style. We finish off with a cup of coffee and mango pudding + sago dessert. The portion size is nice for a light dinner for my 4yr and the both of us. When my carnivorous inner self emerges however, the set is all mine. On our previous visit, I had the half spring chicken and the wife had the salmon, both gave us smiles to return!Service is good but it gets busy when traffic peaks so your mileage may vary.",

They are losing a star because of this. Truly disappointed.So I don't understand why I was ignored. I don't expect to be served first just because I was on crutches but to have my queue cut by the receptionist is just way too much. It also took forever to get the attention of the service staff after my Friend arrived after me.Fried fish noodles in milky soup with vegetables and tomato - still good although I think it was better before the renovation.Chicken chop with cheese, tomato paste, potato, broccoli and carrots - a tad saltish.",

    "text": "It is always crowded, so you definitely need a reservation, especially for lunch. It can be an hour wait if you do not have reservation. Or you may be asked if you can finish your meal in an hour if you pop by without calling. It is THAT busy. I see mostly older folks, families as well as office crowd on weekday lunch time. The lunch set is quite value for money and it is available 7 days a week, and it is different every day. The only thing that is constant on the lunch set menu is the fried fish noodle soup. And that is absolutely my favorite dish. For $12.90++ you get the fried fish noodle soup, choice of drink (coffee, tea or iced lemon tea) and dessert of the day. Quite a good deal, I think. The soup is creamy milky (reminded me a bit of campbellis mushroom soup), with thick bee hoon (you can request for thin bee hoon), slices of tomato, ginger and salted vegetable (I found a strip). The fried fish fillet is on a separate plate so its retain its crispiness though it hardens when cold). The Hainanese chicken rice is only available on Thursday and it is not a big deal. The soup is much better as it is filled with old winter melon, wolfberries, fungus and stuff. I would imagine the steak to be of similar quality as Jack's Place or maybe Hot Tomato and Shashlik. Oxtail stew is available on Wednesday and Friday for the set lunch though it is also available in the a la carte menu too. Prime rib is also available on Friday for $39.90++For a bit of old school nostalgic Western food, The Ship is the place to be.",

I find it to be actually kinda pricey for it's quality. The restaurant has a nice vibe and the staff it's friendly, I hate to say it, but apart from the novel 80s vibe, food wise it's really not that good.",

The authentic woody design and street lamps give a very down to earth feeling, slowing the tempo of the hectic work life in Singapore. Most do not know , \u00a0food to try is the fried fish soup noodle (which cannot be found on the menu!). The soup is perfectly brewed and filling and the fish is definitely something for you to visit again. Its crispy, crunchy and juicy. Certainly an economical place to hang out and dine.Do note that the fish soup noodle gets sold out easily so do call and check if they still serve before going, especially during the evening time!",

You could say at that time, The Ship was one notch above Jack's place. The better choices of steak here usually comes sizzling on a hot plate which risks overcooking so be sure to dig in fast. Food standards have definitely fallen over the years or rather the wide availability of steak now has set a higher standards for my tastebuds. Either way the Ship is worth a visit just for old times sake! AHOY!",
