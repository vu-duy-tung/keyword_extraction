    "text": "Beautiful cafe, went on Friday at 3 pm and there were a lot of seats, so that was nice. Staff was very friendly and the food was great! Ordered the strawberry shortcake that costed 6.5$, the chocolate croissant (it looks like a danish) that was 7$ and the raspberry scone for 4.5$. I ordered the cappucino and it was presented very cutely, with a teddy illustration! The cappucino also came with a cute lil biscuit! Their iced mocha was super delicious, and it costed 7.5$ (it was really good). Their Blissful Berries drink (it's under the tea section) tasted really good too! Not your usual tea I suppose. And also look at their bathroom tho, how extra! Lovely cafe, would definitely come back for a chill tea time with friends. People come here with their families too! Salad-loving friends can join the crew too because they also sell salad, it costs 14.9 and if i'm not wrong they have three 'flavours'. They also have other main dishes!",

Whisk is but one of the many cafes around the area offering you a decent cuppa coffee and pastries. Price range is about the same as most others. Pastry and cake selection not as wide. But still a nice place to just people watch (right at the cross road where Tiong Bahru market is) or just read a book (not as busy as Tiong Bahru bakery right across the road, and definitely not as noisy...). No wifi though and I don't see power points around...",

Honestly ducked in here to use the restroom bc I didn't wanna use the ones at the market. The hub got some English tea and a cream pastry which he said was alright. It was bright inside. And the bathroom was super cute and clean although outdoors kind of so felt hot. Still grateful to be able to use it. They also have French macarons which were v pretty. Not sure of the taste though.",

Not as buttery as a French croissant, but those are hard to find outside of France. \u00a0The price was good and overall the service was good as well.

The staff are really nice but too bad they have a mean lady boss she will say a horrible thing but in a \"nice\" tone, those people are the worst! Good luck!",

The atmosphere is warm and inviting so it's a nice place to relax with a cup of coffee, but the star of the show are the desserts. \u00a0I first tried the cheescake which was amazing... hints of citrus which I quite liked and a smooth, creamy texture. \u00a0Another time I tried the carrot cake; now I'm not really a carrot cake person, but this was damn good. Not too sweet with a nice, nutty flavor. \u00a0Will definitely go back to try other pastries :)",
