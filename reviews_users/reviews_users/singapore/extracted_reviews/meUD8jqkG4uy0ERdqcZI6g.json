    "text": "Good news: The chicken's great! My favourite was the soy chicken wings, but the others were pretty good too. Crispy outside, moist inside. I don't have much to carp about on the food front.Bad news: The service is awful. 2 servers on a Sunday night sounds ok for a small eatery, right? Problem is, they're forgetful. We didn't get our drinks till after the chicken arrived, and only because I asked. The 2nd round of drinks was also forgotten. 2 tables away, it emerged that they hadn't gotten their chicken because the server thought that they were having the chicken buffet option (they weren't, although I fail to see how that should affect their food service). Salad is supposed to be complimentary. We got none. When I asked (presumably the owner), \u00a0he said pretty apologetically that they were probably out. Dude. First, you're open till 2am, and it wasn't even 10pm yet. Secondly, why did we have to ASK to hear that you were out of salad? It should have been said upfront.In sum: If there's another voucher-type deal, we might go again, but otherwise, I'd be willing to pay more for less forgetful and sloppy service.",

The restaurant was a little tight but the atmosphere and energy were great. We ordered a watermelon soju, japchae, dry spicy noodles, chicken wings, and bulgogi fries. Hands down the best things were the wings and fries! The flavors were amazing, plus we got to wash everything down with the watermelon soju, which we really recommend ordering with your dinner (if only for the instagram pic ) Prices are typical for Singapore. Great place for dinner or even for late night snacking.",

    "text": "My favourite place for fried chicken wings - I adore their soya chicken wings which are perfectly fried to a crisp while remaining moist. They also serve several other variations of fried chicken but really, why waste your calories when the soya one is the most awesome. It is a little pricey at 12 bucks for 4 chicken wings but I think it's very much worth it. We also ordered the bulgogi fries and tteokbokki cheese and seafood stew. The fries was tasty with beef that wasn't overly cooked. The stew was a tad too sweet and spicy for my liking. The watermelon soju was interesting but taste wise I think it's mediocre. I tried to make reservations an hour before I arrived and the staff curtly told told me to just show up because reservations are not necessary. When I arrived, the place was full. So that was rather annoying. Emil was friendly and offered recommendations because he thought we may have ordered too much for our party of 3. Unfortunately, it was a little off putting when he insisted we write a review on FB and show him before letting us leave. He did make up for it with a 1-for-1 voucher for dessert but it did mar my impression of the place. Multiple outlets exist but I've only visited this branch.",

Something look totally different from the photo in the menu. But it was great. While seafood topokki, I counted it was only 4 rice cake... 4 rice cakes for $20.... I am not really happy about it. 4.

    "text": "If you want to save a bit (20% off food bill), settle your bill and leave by 730pm. I think it is quite a good incentive for diners to eat and go instead of lingering and chatting among themselves long after the food is gone, and a big crowd is waiting outside for a table. Having read about the crowd if you go at the usual dinner time, we decided to go early and arrived around 6pm. The place was already half filled by then. At around 7pm, there was a line of people waiting for a table and it was only a Monday night. Having spied the early bird special of getting 20% off, we decided to try to leave by 730pm and let others have our table. A feat as we had two friends who only arrived close to 7pm and had just 30 minutes to finish the food. They ran out of the watermelon shell for the watermelon soju so we skipped that. Instead we tried the corn cheese which was really just average. A bit too creamy and cheesy that it was quite jelat (very rich) after a while and it was already shared by 4. The ganjang chicken wings (soy sauce) were really good and I must say I prefer the wings to the actual fried chicken pieces. The fried chicken were cut into 4 pieces and the breast meat was a bit on the dry side and not that enjoyable after a while. It would be worse if you did not order the chicken with any sauce. We had spicy up (not that spicy after all) and yangnyum up (like sweet and sour sauce with a bit of spice). The skin was crispy and delicious and the meat (except breast meat) moist and tender.I think 4 diners are just the right group size to try 2 different types of fried chicken and a side of chicken wings as you get 2 chicken pieces and a chicken wing. It may be different if you are very hungry or have a group of guys. The buffet is still available though they limit a 2 hour window for that.",

Ever since my first taste of Korean fried chicken at Mad for Chicken in NYC (they go by a diff name Tt escapes my pre-caffeinated brain now), I've been longing for those robust and exhilarating flavors again.The search ends at Chicken Up. Exceptionally tender and juicy chicken with a light and superbly crispy batter. BonChon can screw its double fried a** staleness that it claims to be authentic. Yes I'm still darn pissed about Tt crappy chicken that I had there a yr ago at the Bugis+ outlet. Anyway, their mild up spicy isn't that spicy to me so i'll go for suicide chicken next time. I absolutely went gaga over the soya chicken. My gawd. Droolicious I tell ya! First time trying the Andong chicken stew and my.. It was such a silent killer. Be very careful eating this one. I didn't pay attention and a little of the soup went down the wrong pipe and I was coughing and tearing for a long time. That said, it's actually not outrightly spicy if you are careful. Well flavored chicken that falls off the bone. They also have the glass noodles in them.Chicken lovers, this is the place to be! They do a chicken buffet with a beer option. Do check them out!",

    "text": "Really its 4.5 stars. Rejoice! I think I have found my go-to drinking and KFC place on the island. The variety, the vibe, and the sheer portions of the chicken is indeed one up from the rest.The moment you walk into Chicken Up, you feel this warmth about the place- Kpop featured on the big screen, beer and soju all around, call buttons for service... this feels a bit like home (Ktown LA). Simulated and having the concept of \"rounds\" when partying in Korea, I believe that Chicken Up is perfect for \"Ee-Cha\" (2nd round- more drinking and noshing on snacks) before heading out for Karaoke. Something that Singaporeans should really start adapting to.Lets get on with the food, shall we?Original Fried Chicken: Amazing. The skin is fried perfectly and well seasoned, while the meat is super juicy and moist. Honestly delicious. It takes me back to the ones in Korea.I don't even know why real KFC or Popeye's exist when you can have this chicken. Seriously, one of the best.Soy Chicken Wings: Also a delicious marinade. 4 wings, large and meaty with ample soy garlic. Very delicious.Sweet & Spicy Chicken: A bit too sweet for my liking, was hoping to have a bit more kick, but equally delicious. \u00a0They also serve a \"popcorn chicken\" version of this sauce the comes boneless. **Tip for all you Americanized people- this is the closest to Orange Chicken you will get in Singapore. Screw Panda Express, Chicken Up's popcorn chicken + a bowl of rice may very well be my go-to meal at least once a week. It's THAT good.**Odeng Tang (Fishcake soup): I was feeling a bit under the weather but the spicy broth hit the spot. \u00a0The portion of fishcake was VERY generous.Cheese Corn: Gooey, Rich, Creamy- honestly perfect for beer.Truffle Fries: Ample seasoning, good portion for sharing.Beverages: Korean drinks, Hite, Soju, Draft, Asahi, Maggoli, you name it, they have it. Outstanding.Only downfall- the radish cubes were not marinated as well as I liked it to be, but this is a very minor detail.so, why come to Chicken Up? 3 reasons.1. $25 AYCE Chicken Dinner, with $15 AYCD Beer top up. Best deal in town. Perfect for guys2. Perfect place to unwind with your friends, snack, nosh, and catch up on Kpop3. Large and delicious portions and a good variety of Anju (Korean Tapas) Now all they need is a noribang next door and my Ktown experience would be complete here in Singapore.",

    "text": "All I can say is if a) you're super hungry after work b) you love fried chicken, approach Chicken Up with caution. The dude and I are not buffet people. We took the buffet because it made sense to pay $25 to try a few flavors since even though he's half Korean, we both had no idea what Yamyung (?) or Andong stew was. Not being buffet people, we were therefore also set on just enjoying a slow meal, appreciating the flavors and talking instead of trying to cram as much food as possible down our gut.Here's the problem.The fried chicken here is really, really good. I would say it ranks second or slightly on par with No. 5's har cheong gai in terms of fried chicken execution. Very crisp on the outside even after the chicken has cooled, ridiculously juicy on the inside. We had the soy sauce, spicy, curry and popcorn flavors and then a stew each. The stew is quite light and we love the kick from the chillis bouncing off the sweet sauce.Ended up eating way too fast, probably too much and we were very full. Happy too. The \"truffle\" fries (there's really sparse specks of truffle shavings in the salt) were nothing to scream about but they were well fried too. The salad was wilted. But you're not there for these sides.Next time I visit it's probably going to be Hite beer + wings.Oh boy.",

    "text": "We wandered into Chicken Up on a lark as it was one of the only places still open when the hunger instinct hit one Friday night, but we wound up swearing to return, and soon!Due to the late hour, we erred on the side of over-ordering, although to be fair, the outcome would probably have been the same at the normal dinner bell.We decided on some Korean beer, the mild original fried chicken, the popcorn chicken, the cheesy corn and an order of truffle fries. \u00a0Everything was delicious, but it was the cheesy corn ($15) that upped the table tension. \u00a0El Queso Grande and I took one look at the hot cast iron surface with sizzling sweet corn and melty cheese and God only know what other fatty and tasty additives (I suspect butter and mayo) and IT WAS ON! \u00a0Jealously, we eyed one another's progress as we grimly munched and marched towards the exact center line of the sizzling plate, our taste buds writhing in ecstasy.The truffle fries were also quite incredible, easily the best fries I've ever had at a chicken joint. \u00a0We asked and got some Japanese mayo, which made it even better. \u00a0Each fry was perfectly crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside...we fervently hope that they come that way each and every time.The popcorn chicken ($20) was good...as another reviewer mentioned, it's the closest you get to an orange or sesame chicken in Singapore. \u00a0We found the mild original chicken to be decent, but we are looking forward to trying some of the other varieties next time.PARTING THOUGHT: We can't wait to go back for more of that cheesy corn!",

The chicken was perfectly fried to order, all the sauces were super flavorful, and the chicken was juicy. Throw in sides, which you should try not too eat too much of because... CHICKEN. Just be prepared to feel fat and disgusting afterwards.Worth it.",

    "text": "Loved the watermelon soju! Refreshing... I could drink buckets of that stuff. The fried chicken was so tasty. Juicy and crispy. That's how I like it. My fave was the original crispy fried chicken. That was the tastiest. The spicy fried chicken was alright. Not especially spicy nor flavorful. I recommend getting the original rather than the spicy. The soy fried chick was yummy too.Go for the buffet at your own peril. We walked out of there feeling really sick. Really really sick and swearing off fried chicken for the next few months or year. That's because the chicken cuts are pretty big. Like KFC size pieces. So it's not the same as eating wings elsewhere. Go slow... And pace yourself. They took really long serving our chicken so we stuffed our faces with those oily bits and were so happy until that feeling kicked in. Also go for the cheese corn. It could have been more sizzling but it was delicious even unsizzled. Enjoy!",

    "text": "A Vegetarian's Point of View Came here with fried chicken eating friends and had low expectations on my eating options. Surprisingly, there was stuff for me to eat and the chicken smelled and looked really good!The place doesnt look very welcoming from the street but dont let it fool you, the inside is warm, the staff is friendly and their is Girl Generation k-pop playing on a continuous loop. Food-wise, the chicken were huge pieces, kinda like the friend chicken from home where the chickens are genetically engineered. never seen chicken so big in Singapore before. What they call 'Popcorn Chicken' was really the Americanized Orange Chicken from Panda Express only bigger. Looked delicious even though i didnt eat it.Ended up getting the Cheese Corn (fairly good), the salad (good) and the truffle fries (really good). All the portions are huge so bring your appetitive",

    "text": "Call me a fat slob but you cant really go wrong with copious amounts of beer and fried chicken. And that's what you get at the aptly named Chicken Up! - a popular fried chicken outlet from Korea.First, lets talk about the beer. On the menu is something called Suicide Beer. It is essentially a 1-litre mug of Heineken draught. Yep, 1-litre! Not difficult to understand why I like the place, eh? On to the food. Not your usual traditional Korean fare and not quite KFC. One of the side dishes is actually steamed Korean dumplings which are light and delightful, an excellent contrast to the fried chicken. All patrons also gets served free salad and pickles the moment you place your orders. Definitely good to partake in a little greens before the unhealthy stuff. \u00a0The chicken is served spicy or spicier, Korean chilli style! Crispier than crisp on the outside; soft, juicy and tender on the inside. Recently, South Korea's plans for world domination through the incredibly formulaic yet insanely infectious kpop has been gathering pace at an alarming rate. One fortunate by-product is Chicken Up ending up on our shores. This tiny eatery is everything Korean down to their staff, most of the regulars and the insanely annoying yet addictive kpop tunes and programmes broadcasting on their tv. Definitely not one for people who cant stand the kpop phenomenon and prices are more restaurant side than fast food eatery.",
