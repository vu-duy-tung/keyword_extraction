We got: 1) Chicken Satay (Sate Ayam Madura)2) Green Beans (Kacang Panjang Balando)3) Yellow Rice Plate with Chicken (Tumpeng mini)4) Oxtail Soup (Sop Buntut)5) Spicy Chicken (Ayam Bumbu Rujak) 6) Beef Rendang (Rendang Sapi)7) Bakwan Jagung The must gets are the chicken satay, green beans and yellow rice plate. Everything is legit but not that memorable. The prices are very reasonable for Singapore not in a hakkar stand.",

We also got the red curry and some veggie soups. Everything was extremely tasty and we asked for extra sauces as well. Service was great",

    "text": "My image of Indonesia cuisine tends to overlap with Malaysian cuisine--a lot of Sambal, spices, rich gravy that contains coconut and that belachan that gives the dishes a very defining \"shiok\"-ness. After visiting Indochilli, I like to add an essential word to the list and that is \"sweetness\".As a spicy food lover with a sweet tooth, I love the fact that most of the dishes are not shy on the sugar which gives them more character. For instance, the Chicken Satay Madura ($7.80 for 5 sticks) featured juicy charcoal-grilled chicken dressed in sweet peanut sauce. However, I felt that the Tahu Telor ($8.80) and the Gado Gado ($6.80) could hold the sugar in tighter rein. That said, the omelette in the Tahu Telor was deep-fried till puffy, creating a delectable textural contrast with the beancurd and the dark luscious chunky peanuts. The first few mouthfuls of the Cah Kangkong ($8.80) were too salty, but somehow the spice and sourness began to emerge as we dig further down where a pool of red liquid could possibly dilute and balance the overall flavour. I had to restrain ordering anything too spicy since the little one has yet develop her tolerance for spicy food. So for families with kids, the ikan baker ($21.80)-- grilled fish in Indonesian sweet soy sauce, might be a safe option but do not that there is still hints of spiciness. It would be a bonus if the fish was fresher. We all loved the Sop Buntut ($14.80), a robust oxtail soup whose acidity can be managed with some squirts of lime and sambal belachan. Served with belinjo crackers or more commonly known as the Emping crackers.If I were to pick a dish to have again, it would be this traditional Javanese Royal dish known as Tumpeng Mini ($9.80), not because of the delicious array of side ingredients, but because of the YELLOW rice which were exceptionally fragrant and moist. As I continue to lament at the shortage of such good Southeast Asian restaurants in Singapore, I have discovered an all-new love for Indonesian cuisine. All thanks to the sambal.",

    "text": "rather impressive indonesian food, and surprisingly cheap for being in this part of close-to-town. I'm no purist, if you haven't figured, nor a connoisseur of indonesian food - so I treat it much the way I do thai: I like it spicy and tasty.it's a beautiful restaurant, not big by any means, but decorated rather elegantly with ethnic looking furnishings in a modern layout. service is prompt if a little taciturn - and they just wouldn't recommend any dishes on the basis of personal preference (which isn't untrue, but suggestion is always appreciated).the food comes flying out the kitchen, which is both a boon and a doom - especially if you do as we did and ordered far too much. best to stagger your ordering, so that you always get to eat the food hot - though it don't much matter if you don't, for indonesian food does pretty darn well cold too.we started with fried keropok, the traditional sort that's colored all red-green-yellow on the circumference, before the rest of the mains arrived.rawon komplit was a dark stew of beef served alongside salted eggs - the salt of which really played off the sweetish-savouriness of the dish. there could have been a little more meat in there though, and what was included was rather sinewy - it reminded me that eating beef in less developed beef is often a chewy and stringy affair.the ayam panggang padang though, was generously large, tender, and very moist. barbecued very well (that sauce was caramelized all over), it was slightly spicy and sweet, and tore off easily - very delicious, and possibly my favorite dish.then the nasi timbel arrived, looking even more delicious than it had on the menu. I think you could get by very well just ordering this for your meal, a roll of banana-wrapped rice topped with a fried chicken breast, fried firm beancurd and tempeh, and delicious chilli. tasty components, but the chicken was dry and stringy, which threw the dish off - woulda been perfect with the barbecued chicken thigh.spicy cumi bakar jimbaran had more of that slightly sweet-spicy profile that seems to thread through the entire meal (both the chicken and various chilli pastes have it), and was cooked well till tender, not at all rubbery and well permeated with the sauce.our last main dish was the coconutty kacang panjang balado of long beans stir-fried with beansprouts and carrot slivers. savory and fragrant with coconut, just past the point of al dente, and quite tasty (but not a health food at all, I'd imagine).we finished with es teler, which is a sort of iced fruit cocktail. unlike the canned fruit monstrosity dessert you might think of, this was rather some coconut-milk-saturated crushed ice topped with slivers of coconut and jackfruit, and a generous serving of avocado. it's a seemingly simple dessert that rather catches you with the less sweet notes of the avocado - and strikes a balance between the rich avocado and the other lighter components.it's a good meal, all in all - I have very little complaint and quite a lot of want to go back. prices were very reasonable considering the location it's in (right opposite great world city in the expat-conclave of zion road), and especially when the food is this good.",

Ok. \u00a0Not a place where it is a must for your indo fix. \u00a0 The beef rendang was nice - tender with enough spice. \u00a0Gado gado was below par even losing out to warung penyek at lucky plaza. \u00a0Had the grilled siting with sambal and again was ok but not mind blowing. \u00a0Satay was nice not dry. The sambal goreng was also ok. \u00a0Otherwise all ok ok..........",

    "text": "Tried here based on people's recommendations. Gotta be honest the whole experience was pretty average. The rendang was on the dry side. and lacking sufficient sauce. What sauce there was though was well balanced and tasty. Gado gado was decidedly average lacking the usual crunch and combination of textures and flavours one expects in the dish. The peanut sauce was overly heavily, tofu falling apart and the dish was padded out with more than usual amount of bean sprouts. They could be more generous with the egg too. Overall it's not the worse Indonesian I've had but they could have done a lot better. Staff were friendly so Maybe they were just having an off night in the kitchen",
