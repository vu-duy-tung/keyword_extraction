Thin crispy crust with lots of cheese (but not too much) and basil (which could've been more) \u00a0Super fast service, and the pizza was piping hot. \u00a0It's nice that it's in the neighboorhood, so bonus points for that.",

I ordered a pizza and a spaghetti bolognese and the cheese wasn't attached to the pizza, crust was hot but the center was warm, and the spaghetti was definitely reheated. \u00a0Ended paying 75 Singapore dollars for that small pizza and spaghetti along with some still water. Talk about a ripoff",

Reason why I would never go back again though is because I ordered a pizza + spaghetti and meatballs takeaway, only to find out that they forgot the spaghetti when I got home. \u00a0Pretty bad as it is given such a small order to forget something when not busy.. but.. happens. when i go back later to get a refund for the spaghetti and meatballs, the owner would only refund me the portion for the pasta, not the meatballs... hmm.. maybe i was just expecting too much that I should get a refund for the entire dish? needless to say. over $15, the cheap owner has lost a customer for life.",

    "text": "Come on. This is a great pizza place that has Verace certification. Yes, it is a little expensive but not more than Da Paolo which is worse (too thin, non-fresh mozzarella). Also, this is Singapore and their rent is probably $30,000/month and they are importing at least their tomatoes and mozzarella from Italy. This is the same price you would pay for this quality in New York or Seattle or Tokyo (and cheaper than Paris). This is also a more convenient location than Tanjong Katong, Operetta's other location which is much farther from an MRT station. AND they have a couple of red wines priced under $50.This place could be habit-forming.",

Serving up only the most authentic pizza, it's clear your paying for quality. Everything is freshly made so that's great and service is pretty quick.... So if you're in the area give this place a go!",

The pizza is good, but expensive.And it leaves a bad taste in my mouth when they deceive about the price. \u00a0I went for the 1-for-1 pizza from 2:30-5:30 pm every day. \u00a0The server told me the 2 most expensive pizzas are not included on 1-for-1. Fine, I order my pizzas. \u00a0When I go up to pay the bill, it seems higher than usual. \u00a0The waiter doesn't want to show me my receipt. He makes me pay before he shows me the receipt. When I finally see the receipt, it's not a pizza that I ordered! \u00a0And it's $30, whereas the most expensive pizza I ordered was $28.He said that the 1-for-1 deal was $30. That is NOT a one-for-one deal, that is 2 for $30 (and it's only certain pizzas). \u00a0Because they don't have it written anywhere or tell you, it seems like a deceptive practice to me.You should know this -- it would be a shame if you ordered 2 of the cheapest pizzas ($18, and end up paying $30 when you expect it to be $18. \u00a0Right???)When I expect a certain price but I end up paying more, it doesn't make me like the place very much.",

The day we came there was a special where you get 2 pizzas for the price of 1 which made it a bit more reasonably priced.I'll probably return due to the convenient location but it's eerie coming on the weekend b/c this place is a complete ghost town.",

Mais was cream sauce base with mozzarella/corn/ham/mushroom/basil/parmesan.Diavola was tomato sauce based with chilli/salami/mozzarella//mushroom/basil/parmesan.I guess a lot of the ingredients in those two pizzas are similar.. Anyway, fairly nice thin crust. The zing of the chilli on the Diavola was well appreciated :) Hence my preference for that slice! I found the salami a bit salty though, but that's just me not liking too-salty things in general.I think the pizza cost around $26++, somewhat pricey. Nice place to sit though!",
