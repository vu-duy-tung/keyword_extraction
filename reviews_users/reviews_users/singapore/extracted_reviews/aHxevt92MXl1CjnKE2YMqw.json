    "text": "Hainanese chicken rice is just chicken and rice but somehow it comes together in an amazing way. Yet Con does it right, in my opinion, especially since the key to a good chicken rice is actually the rice. The rice is the most flavorful thing and it's just delicious. Contrary to other reviewers, both times I've been to Yet Con I've found the chicken to be very moist and well complemented by the cucumbers. I also love love love the soup, since it's full of cilantro (aka coriander leaf). I love how homey and kampong-y the shop feels, having been around since the 1940s. Yet Con will always be my favorite chicken rice. I want to try the steamboat next time I come too!",

    "text": "Hainanese Chicken Rice is one of the most eaten food when one travels to Singapore. Since it is quite affordable, I decided to eat as much as possible with every chance I get.My first stop is Yet Con Hainanese Chicken Rice. Yet Con has been around since 1940s and have been serving the same style of Chicken Rice since then. According to purist, Yet Con is the traditional and original Hainanese Style. I was a little antsy when I saw the deco of Yet Con. I believe that it must have been in business for over 70 years and it is as old school as one can get. But at least, it is Air Conditioned, a luxury as compare to hawker centres. Trust me, you would appreciate that when it is 40 C + with humidity!So what so unique about Yet Con's Chicken? According to CNN's website, Instead of hanging the chickens up after cooking, they are put on enamel plates to prevent the juice from dripping, so that the flavors are retained. The chicken here is really lean with no trace of fat, the leanness of the chicken does make the meat a tad dry. However, I would say it is quite flavoured... flavour of the chicken?I do really enjoy the rice, which has great flavour and quite savoy!Sadly, I enjoyed the rice and the condiments more than the chicken itself..... Yet Con is worth visiting just for their old school vibe!",

Much of Yet Con's look is very dated because it appears like it was never renovated since its opening and this establishment has been around for a while. Boasting yummy chicken rice (not the best in SG but darned tasty regardless), yummy beef crispy noodles (\u751f\u9762), fried rice with wok heat, and other comfort food, this is a place that the old faithfuls will go. And prices are still affordable.You gotta love the place. I give this a four stars for simply having that nostalgic favor. And for staying to their guns by serving simple yummy fare at unbeatable prices. Honestly, that's all we can ask for, right? My only hope that tourists will check it out. Manage your expectations. It is not The Raffles Hotel but once you step in there, you will be transported to Singapore circa the 60s. And please....don't disappear, Yet Con!!!",

After arriving in Singapore, we took a cab from the hotel to Yet Con. Surprisingly the cab driver doesn't know about Yet Con, but she knows Purvis St and could take us there. The restaurant just gives you a good nostalgia of how a restaurant is like in the old days. The place has A/C, so you don't have to worry about eating here in the hot summer weather. We (a party of four) enjoyed a half chicken, roasted pork with salted vegetables and Chinese pickles (kiam chai) soup. We enjoyed mixing the sauce (ginger, chili, and soy sauce). You may not get the right combination the first time, but we finally got to what we like after a while. The service was fine since my dad can speak Mandarin. The old man at the cashier uses his abacus to calculate the bill. I read on the blog that he is the last of his generation at this restaurant which has been in business for over 70 years!",

Thankfully, it's got modern air-conditioning so you can dine in comfort, though there are the occasional annoying flies that get stuck in there with you.People throng the place for its chicken rice, and the old uncle stands in his usual spot at the front entrance chopping up chicken and other meat. Several of my older friends love the chicken rice for its authentic and slightly muted flavour which somehow reminds them of their younger days - the steamed chicken is served without the usual sauce condiments you get in most chicken rice these days, and the rice is not so oily, but I personally wished it was a bit more flavourful.There are a bunch of other dishes which are popular as well - many other diners were ordering the fish maw, and the pork ribs were pretty yummy. The roast pork had a sweet burnt sauce which wasn't to my liking but the texture was not bad.Overall not a bad dining experience - go early if you're keen because it's a small place that gets crowded during lunch and on the weekends!",

    "text": "One of the most attractive things about Yet Con is that they offer quality chicken rice in the very heart of the city and provide you with an air-conditioned environment to have it in. Once you can make it past the queue you'll feel like you're stepping back in time. What I love about this place is that old tea house feel to the place, from the furniture to the decoration and even the abacus that the man at the counter still uses - none of those funny machine things!This place serves up the most genuine Hainanese dishes that you might find in Singapore, with tastes rather different from how you'd imagine them to be. You'll definitely be getting their chicken rice of course, but the rice itself isn't the regular chicken rice you've grown accustomed to, but is a less oily, more salty, with a less 'prima' taste to it. You might have to try it for yourself - I don't find that I can quite describe this properly...it really just so different from the norm. The chicken itself is more meaty than the average kampung chicken, and also a bit juicier. I initially found it a little uncomfortable because some bits appeared a little undercooked such that you could still see the red in it, but that's apparently how it's meant to be so I trust that they only get the best and cleanest chicken.We also got their roast pork, which I wasn't expecting to be any good in a 'chicken rice shop' but it turned out to be quite unique as well. Very very thinly sliced roast pork, drenched in a sweet sauce, with preserved vegetables hiding under it. There was a bit of that acidic taste, probably from the vegetables, but it was quite a wonderful change from the standard crispy and salty roast pork you usually get. Well, this was really quite crispy as well, but the taste was just different.We ended with a bowl of fish maw soup: very simple presentation, very simple soup, but very generous portions and very wholesome taste. Complete with squid, prawns, fish meat and lots of fish maw and vegetables, it packed a good taste in each mouth. Definitely worth getting.What surprised us most was that for the three of us with three dishes, the whole bill came up to nothing more than $24 (I even had a lime juice!), which I thought was stunningly cheap.

    "text": "There are plenty of chicken rice places in the Seah St/Purvis Street area (Hainanese enclave, a long time ago), so why this one? I love Yet Con for the dark, thick, rich soy sauce, and for, when you are lucky enough to get it, their roast pork. It's much darker than the usual golden brown, but the crackling is light (can I say airy?), and the car adds a certain something. The sweet soy they drizzle on that is delicious too.When I am not eating alone, we like to order from their zi char menu to supplement the meats--there are some zi char favorites such as hot plate tofu, but the thing to go for is the stir fried fish maw. So good that I could drink the gravy! Steamboat is also available, though I haven't tried it and so cannot comment.I suspect Yet Con has not changed its looks (interior and exterior) or its staff since it opened. There is air conditioning, never fear, but the tiled floors, marble-topped tables (having long since lost their shine) reflect the age of the staff. I am especially fond of the white-haired uncle at the cashier. Do note that Yet Con is one of the more popular establishments in the area, so be prepared to come early, or to wait for a table. This is true both at lunch and dinner. Service is efficient bordering on brusque, but you're here to eat, no?",

They have a jar of minced Ginger on the table that brings another flavor dimension with the chicken.Go for the Hainanese BBQ pork. \u00a0Crispy pork chunks with preserved mustard greens balance the chicken's delicate flavor.",

    "text": "While others might rave about the authentic Hainanese Chicken Rice at this old shophouse restaurant, I beg to differ. The chicken rice flavor here was way too plain and average for my liking. While the chicken rice does not suit my palate, I have found treasures out of other dishes here. The Hainanese Pork Chops are one of the treasures. This tomato-based sauce pork chops were tasty and flavorful. The pork fillet was well marinated and fried till crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. Paired with the sweet and sour tomato sauce and onions, the dish was marvelous. This place is one you can feel nostalgic in, as you have a feel of what olden-day Singapore would look like. The setting is traditional and vintage, which seems to be what attracts the crowd.",

The Hainanese proprietor is a constant, as are the staff, the marble tables and the general interior. Food : We like the chicken rice and the chicken itself is decent, but what we REALLY love are the Hainanese pork chops. Sliced to the perfect thickness and deepfried to a delicious crumbiness with a generous helping of sweet and sour gravy, it is a comfort food that transcends generations. The prawn fritters are also fluffy and delicious, but be sure to eat them while hot and crisp. The tofu with seafood and vegetables is pretty good too, with the distinct taste of wok hei in every bite. The steamboat is pretty good on rainy days too.Ambience : Old school. Love it.Service : Fast. Efficient. Good.",
