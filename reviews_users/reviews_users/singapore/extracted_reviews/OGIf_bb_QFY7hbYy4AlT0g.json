    "text": "In the Orchard area, you can make your way to a few places for a steak and find some good choices. \u00a0Black Angus represents a simple, chain type experience with quality meat consistent with good US standards. \u00a0I have been here a couple of times and usually to take a colleague who is staying in the area to somewhere simple and convenient. \u00a0This place has no air of a fancy steak house and the prices are Singapore-reasonable. \u00a0The al fresco dining experience is actually a nice set up situated between Modestos and Brewerks near the Tanglin and Orchard intersection. \u00a0Lots of visitors, expats, and locals enjoying the scene and it is usually a busy area to do some people watching. \u00a0This is a super casual atmosphere and the service is quick and efficient. \u00a0The Tiger beer is nice and cold and from my experience its all about the steak. \u00a0I have tried the filet mignon and center cut sirloin. \u00a0Both were great cuts - every bite is tender and the butcher knows how to prevent too much \"extras\" from getting in the way. \u00a0The sides are a bit lame; small baked potato or french fries, zucchini and steamed broccoli... but that isn't really why you are there.For a decent steak that is served with little fuss this is a good place to stop.",

    "text": "A true 2-star steakhouse.This is a North American import, and it shows in how some of the dishes miss the mark completely; whilst others are what you would expect. The service was just plain terrible. Long waits, 3-4 different people looking after us whilst our actual server was standing around looking bored the whole time. Which is kind of the vibe of the place.There was very few people actually in the restaurant so our expectation was that wait times would be minimised with dishes flying out of the kitchen. But we were oh so wrong!You've crossed the threshold of service suckery, when you reach the point of asking to cancel your order - we did this after watching orders go to newly arriving people whilst our simple steaks were 45 minutes waiting. The reason for ordering steak is that it is quick to cook (especially at medium rare) so you have an expectation on the timing.If you want to get a jug of beer you are going to be limited to Tiger only, so be prepared for that going in. If you are fine with bottles they have some american beers (Miller, Budweiser) as well as the usual suspects Heineken and Corona. Was surprised to see Kilkenny here - but that's a good thing.We each ordered the cheapest steak on the menu (I think it's something like $25 for the Trailriders Top Sirloin 9oz cut) and we shared the wagon wheel sampler platter which is Crispy Fried Garlic-Pepper Zucchini, Chipotle-Buffalo Chicken Tenders, Loaded Potato Skins and Shrimp Cocktail.The chicken and potato skins were both great; the zucchini was OK (it spent a little too long in the deep fryer and had too much batter), and the shrimp looked dubious so we all avoided that. The steak, when it came, was cooked as ordered (medium rare) and tasted pretty good but it's expensive for what you get.Overall impression: The poor service ruined what otherwise would have been a satisfactory (if expensive) meal. We waited over 45 minutes for the steak; and actually asked to cancel our order before it suddenly magically appeared.With better service this could be a 3-4 star venue.",

    "text": "Business dinner with my bosses and colleagues on a weekday without reservation was no problem.We shared a \"wagon wheel\" appetizer plate which came with zucchini, cheese potatoes, shrimps etc. It was good but I'm not too much into deep fried stuff.I choose a rib eye steak with mashed potatoes for main course and it came with veggies on the side. A really good steak with some vitamins added - no complaints here.I ordered some ice tea and asked for the sugar on the side so I can add it to my needs. Took the waiter some time to get it but he figured it out.All in all a good place to go and having a nice dinner while people watching on the road as you can sit outside and enjoy yourself in the evening breeze.",

    "text": "A bunch of us went to Black Angus to try something different, and much like the leader of North Korea, this place needs to be replaced with something a lot better.We skipped the appetizer because the portions were so big, and went straight for the Jug of Tiger beer ($36.48) which is way too much for a little over a litre of beer - get serious! For the mains, went with the Campfire Combo of sirloin and baby back ribs ($48.26) which was very average. The meat was not much better than what you get at Cold Storage - just not a quality cut. You have to apply the sauce yourself - in my case pepper. The ribs were not much better - cooked without much flavour, and then you have to add the BBQ sauce on it. Seriously, this place is rubbish. The sides were good though - the salad and coleslaw were very nice.But, for $70 I expect a lot more, there are a lot better steakhouses that may be the same price, but at least their meat is a much higher quality. Lastly, add the GST and service charge to the menu prices.",

Had the blooming onion appetizer although black angus calls it something different. The food arrived quickly and the service overall was actually good. The steak when it arrived was mediocre. Not a great cut of meat. Flavor was just OK. Would not be in a great hurry to go back. The search for good value steak in Singapore goes on.",

    "text": "great steaks - and for incredible value - in this steakhouse located just outside orchard parade hotel. in a food climate that allows fancy restaurants to masquerade as steakhouses, serving exorbitantly-priced steaks without even the comfort of sides to lubricate the deal (paying for sides that ought to be there is one thing - and what are these double-digit figures for a mound of mash and a few skinny beans), this place is a godsend if you love your meat and have a beef with those newfangled places. it's a return to true old-school american steakhouses where you sit down to an expertly-cooked slab of meat and sides, no fancy-schmancies.we always start off with a couple of appetisers - the breaded mushrooms and a rotation between the cheesy garlic bread or zucchini fritters. all good. but really, the beef is it. there are a choice of meats on the menu - different cow cuts, chicken and seafood - all attestably good; but I come for the beef. steakhouses of this sort aren't really in vogue at the moment - they lose in exoticism and hullabaloo in comparison to those newfangled spanish places we see everywhere - but this place remains my favourite; reliably good food and great fuss-free service. the beef is pink as you order it - juicy and beefy and tender and wholly satisfying, the potatoes fluffy and delicious, and the vegetables bright green and simply salted.we've never made it to dessert here - usually too stuffed, but there's a mud pie and chocolate fudge cake calling my name on that menu.",
