Both of us had the tempura soft shelled crab which was beautifully \u00a0cooked and presented. The cod was perfectly cooked (extremely fresh and moist). \u00a0My braised beef cheek was so tender it was almost unnecessary to have a knife, and was delicious. Desserts were both excellent. \u00a0One of the best lunches we have ever had. \u00a0Portions are not large but adequate. \u00a0Reviews are correct about the price. Three course for $S 42, but my wife upgraded the entree to Atlantic Cod for$8 and dessert to Kaya Toast for $9. \u00a0I upgraded to braised beef cheeks for $12 and vacherin goma (black and white sesame ice cream) for $5. But still worth the price due to extremely good food and service. \u00a0We met Chef Tan who came to see how we liked the meal. \u00a0He took pictures with us and even showed us his kitchen since I said I am a foodie. Memorable experience overall !",

    "text": "We came to Corner House for dinner on our second night in town. The restaurant itself is within Singapore Botanical Gardens, but even though we came after the gardens had closed and the sun was setting, there are clear signs from the taxi dropoff to direct you to Corner House without much trouble. Once there, you are escorted up the stairs into the main dining area. There are different sections to it, given the older colonial nature of the building, but the finishes are modern and refined like much of the city-state itself. One of the standouts for sure, alongside the decor, is the general ambiance and the plateware in particular - it has the feeling of a high-end restaurant but comes off as more relaxing (thanks to the temperature here, no one shows up in the more formal dress I would expect to see at a European or American Michelin-starred restaurant), but the design and thoughtfulness of the food presentation is evident. Drinks are limited to an extensive selection of wines; I stuck with a glass of white and red for the meal itself, both of which were quite good. As for service, I found it a bit more attentive than Candlenut (from the previous night), but in a similar fashion, it was not overly personalized either.In a similar vein, what was listed on our tasting menu was exactly what we got - no deviation or extra surprises along the way. While there are other menu options if you don't come over the weekend, you only have the option of the tasting menu otherwise (we were there Sunday). You get 9 courses, but two of those are the amuse bouche and the petit fours, so it is a bit more of a compressed tasting menu than I was expecting to have. That said, I felt that every dish was very strong as a result - it certainly seemed that the chef and their staff were able to focus on making each dish as good as possible. The amuse bouche to start off were mostly small bites and served in an interesting fashion - our fish skin chips with trout roe were served atop a bed of small pebble. My favorite of the amuse bouche round was the last dish presented, which was an excellent raw shrimp dish served with cucumbers and a lime-infused broth - simple and refreshing. We moved onto more seafood that was excellently prepared. The scallop dish was served cool and with dry ice, and combined with the yuzu, was fresh, and the geoduck clam that came next was served with a generous amount of sliced clam and pasta - making it a bit of an Italian-inspired dish that focused mainly on showcasing the seafood flavors instead of being doused with sauce. The white asparagus dish was a nice respite from the rest of the meal - the only vegetarian course outside of dessert - but a bit more restrained from a flavor perspective. The highlight was definitely the blue cod, which was served with the scales of the skin crisped, mixing the succulence of the fish fillet with the saltiness and crunchy texture of the skin...definitely one of the most beautiful-looking fish dishes I have eaten (and gorgeously presented to boot). The wagyu was presented on a mostly empty slate plate, but it was quite delicious (although it could have been cooked a tad more - the middle was too rare for my liking). We finished up the meal with a fantastic serving of French strawberries with sorbet as a palate cleanser / first dessert, followed by a chocolate mousse served with Earl Grey ice cream and shards of different chocolates - probably the heaviest dish of evening, but a nice way to end the meal sated.Corner House is a more Western-oriented restaurant in the heart of so much delicious southeast Asian cuisine, but even if you have limited time here, it is worth the stop to enjoy a cosmopolitan setting within the wilderness and a delicious meal to boot. To me, it feels like an appropriate representation of what Singapore has become, and it's worth making the trek out from the city center (about a 15-20 minute drive) to dine here.",

    "text": "A huge splurge for a brilliant meal in the heart of Singapore's Botanical Gardens. Impeccable service - my love of this restaurant is skewed by the incredible amuse bouche and a single petit four.The Salted Egg Macaroons. My god. These might be one of the best things I have ever eaten. They melt on your tongue, leaving a cacophony of flavour. If there's a peak for Singapore's salted egg obsession, this is it.But truth be told - the rest of the meal was a mix of the innovative and unexciting. The asparagus was quite plain. The gariguette strawberry quickly became an unrecognisable mix of fruit flavours. The crispy cod, though, was perfection and use of frozen creme fraiche exciting. The venue is beautiful, and the service impeccable. Even if dinner (plus three house wines between four) cost a hefty $400 sgd, it was an evening to remember.",

The restaurant is situated in the Botanic Gardens, and you may want to look up on how to get there, because the garden is quite... large. I find the food here generally technically competent, with flavor pairings quite fresh, and a fusion of French and a teensy bit of Modsin, which I really enjoy. The Modsin here doesn't go too far, and instead teases the diner here and there.I had the:Amuse bouche, prawn cracker and oyster leafNothing to shout about, nice and crunchyCarabinero prawn with tomatoesI would have loved to eat this with a local prawn, but carabinero works too. Red on red, went very well.Foie gras MousseI loved the petal garnish, but also well-executed, nothing extraordinary.Cod with crispy scalesThis, I loved. I have not eaten such crispy scales, with no hint of oil, and such a harmonious balance with the cod and the sauce. Also, very aesthetically pleasing.WagyuWell-executed, with a delicious onion... thing. My friend doesn't eat beef so they swapped it out with pork.Durian bread and butter puddingI felt the durian could have been stronger, but overall, very tasty, and sweet.Petit foursSalted egg macarons were yum, though the salted egg could have been heavier. Chocs were, well, good.I love this place for their aesthetically pleasing food, and its modsin influence. I do feel it could be better by being a bit more daring. The food here is really technically competent, but could utilize more local produce. Love!",

    "text": "Short review: gourmet hawker center. Long review:Food is creative but not exhilarating. Ambiance is typical and very short of special. Hype is overwhelming with Michelin accolades and table scarcity. You can spend $300pp much more wisely than eating here. Biggest disappointments include uneven table lighting which led to many dark spots and light spots creating unnecessary contrast (no photo pictures because of this), lack of intimacy (group table in the main dining room was extremely loud and shouting across from each other like it was a drunk wedding, which the waitstaff did nothing to help the other annoyed patrons wishing for a quiet dinner), overall casual atmosphere (T-shirt's and crocs allowed).I would have felt a lot better about this place if people felt compelled to treat this place like a formal restaurant rather than a hawker center. Don't \u00a0bother dressing nicely, because you will certainly be overdressed. With that in mind, this is a restaurant not worthy of a special occasion. Instead, go here to kick off a hen or stag party if you're keen on dropping $300-400 per person.",

    "text": "Totally a restaurant that caught me off guard - one that I saved towards the end of my SG upper tier restaurant binge. Highly recommended in every regard - setting, service, food, and creativity. My girlfriend and I made a Sunday dinner reservation where, quite frankly, I was expecting a typical French fusion restaurant that I see all over NYC, London, etc but there has to be a reason that it is Top 50 in Asia (even though the list is totally hit or miss). We arrived at the drop off location (after a short period of getting lost - Make sure you go to the Nassim Gate location which is at Nassim Road and Cluny Road. Google Maps took us to the other side of the Botanic Gardens at Corner House Gate which is the service entrance), pretty cool to have a buggy waiting and greeting you by name for the short ride to the restaurant.We sat down at a beautiful corner table and were immediately served with champagne followed with the menu. We opted for the dinner Discovery tasting menu which was a well portioned 8 course experience (see image). Afterwards we were presented the wine menu which was extremely French heavy and what I thought was a very expensive list. We did a nice bottle of Hermitage.I LOVE restaurants that exceed expectations by a long shot. Every menu option was just...WOW. Not a single course that wasn't to my liking on top of the level of artistry in each. The specific items that blew my mind were the \"Interpretation of my favorite vegetables\" which was a few different snacks using onion, each of which were surprisingly fantastic. Would you ever think an onion tea would be appetizing? IT WAS!! Or onion with truffle or dried onion slices? SO GOOD!! Also was the \"Chef Jason's botanica\" which was simply an art piece. Should be in a museum somewhere. Lastly was his \"My favorite childhood food memory\" dessert with meringue crackers, homemade pandan kaya and toasted bread - which was totally out of this world. Anytime a top tier fusion restaurant includes local cuisine so prominently in their cooking, I get happy.Service was impeccable. The waiters were all very kind and friendly, not a single ounce of stuffiness or pretentiousness that you might see at other restaurants of this caliber. To add the final touch of perfection, Jason Tan himself greeted us and bid us farewell as we finished our visit. Easily part of the top 5 favorite restaurants in all of Asia. Highly recommend if on a date with someone special (you are in the Singapore Botanic Gardens after all), a beautiful nice family dinner or a group get together!",

My heel broke as I was getting out of the taxi and I carried my shoes to the entrance of the restaurant and asked if the had some tape or a stapler so I could perform surgery on my shoe. The hostess took my shoe and told me to have a seat. She fixed it in 5 minutes so I could climb the stairs to our table. She was so sweet and really added to the memory of our first anniversary. I'm so thankful for her!Now to what I know most of you care about shoe repair--food! The menu was rather concise. They offered the chefs tasting meal which had multiple choices for $248 per person or a more limited menu for $98 per person that included fewer items. We started with a wonderful bottle of Riesling for $100.Please see my photos for more information on our meal, which was absolutely delightful. Everything was prepared perfectly. The textures and flavors blended perfectly and the service was phenomenal. This place is great for a special occasion, anniversary or birthday. It's not very Paleo-friendly, but it's definitely worth the cheat!",

    "text": "The 2-storey restaurant sets the mood for \"exquisite eating\" which I didn't hesitate to replace the word for appropriateness. Instead, fine-dining is far too distant from my experience for which the place is less intimidating but harbor a sense of friendliness and a perfect spot for a daytime botanical meal.The lunch is a quick meal intended with no fuss selection except for a top-up if you want a Riso pasta or a Kaya Toast as dessert. A 3-course is priced at $38++ while you may go for a Luncheon Discovery menu which offers a 5-course at $88++ when you have a more generous lunch hour. We were led to our table swiftly and they were very attentive to our needs. We were given amble time to decide on our choices and we were brief on the idea behind the dishes and the assembles on our plate each time we were served. That's the whole service I give honor to as I care extensively about what I eat and how they flavored my dining exposure.They came around with a bread basket piling with fresh baguette and wholegrain slices for you to pick out. I was look forward to the small heap of Yves Bordier French butter - very rich and creamy. Like we did, sprinkle a few sea salt flakes on your buttered bread and bon app\u00e9tit!We were presented with the Marinated Norwegian Salmon Trout for a start. I am not a big fan of any cured fish except for certain meat. Nevertheless, the teaser wasn't a turn off but was quite lovely given a gentle sweet hint in the creme sauce underneath the bed of salad pyramid with onions, celery strips while the petit flying fish roe went popping in my mouth. The salmon is nice without a fishy note, very nicely cured.I had the free range chicken instead of the Riso Pasta (supplement of $8), the latter reminds me of Orzo pasta which I once had at The Waterfall Cafe and am still liking it. I didn't want too much carbs so the chicken dish appeals to me. The Free Range Chicken has a very fine texture, baby tender like a juvenile. The skin is lightly pan-seared although its thick fatty tissue is somewhat freaking me out. Jason uses a mix of white and yellow corn kernels for the key flavor which heightens the taste a notch further with natural sweetness. The foam like I guess was supposedly the poultry emulsion patterning the plate.I tasted the impressive \"The interpretation of Kaya Toast\" (supplement of $8) and was feeling complete! The taste of Gula Melaka has made a strong statement in the dessert while the pandan scent has went into hidding. I love the intensity of the coconut palm sugar, mirroring the chendol we once knew. The muscovaldo sand bits adds bites to the cream along with the citrus element in the yuzu sorbet - heavenly match.Alternatively, you may choose to go with the Soursoup Sorbet which is no inferior than the kaya toast. It has a smooth texture with a robust Soursoup accent that arrived with a sweet indication. Not overly nectarous when accompanied by a bed of Morello cherry compote. The pretty-looking meringue extends a light crunch to the frictionless construction. It gives you a soft and dainty closure to your afternoon meal. However if you adore a loud booming ending, go for the kaya toast which conferred a long lasting impression as it did on me.Oh they have free buggy service, ring them up and check on the pick up within the botanic garden.Bon appetit, yelpers!!!",

The food is excellent. Each course was sublime, carefully prepared and presented as a piece of art. As expected its pricy. Perfect for that special occasion. Very romantic. A great place for couples to pop the question. The chicken was one of their signature dishes. Deceptively simple but the breast was brined and sous verde. The cooking and preparation method ensured that it was tender and succulent with the brine intensifying the flavor. The dark meat was brined and pan fried. 2 methods, very different and went well in contrast.",

    "text": "I was a big fan of Au Jardin les Amis that used to occupy the same premises, so I really wanted to check out the new restauranteur. Came for lunch with 2 friends. We all ordered the four course lunch menu ($58++ per person), which came with a choice of 2 appetizers. Food proved excellent - good variety of flavors and combination of tastes - and met my expectations based on my experience with Au Jardin. The style is listed as \"modern European\" on this website, but the waiter pointed out local influences, so it was more like contemporary fusion. The pork jowl was exceptional. The only thing that might do with improvement was what seemed to me the overuse of mousse-type sauces and creams. As for service, a couple of the wait staff were excellent but a couple of others looked grumpy (one made eye contact with me several times and just stared with no hint of a smile). I also had to ask for my water glass to be refilled midway through the meal. No one asked if we'd like coffee/tea afterwards. Unfortunate that the service overall did not match the outstanding food.",
