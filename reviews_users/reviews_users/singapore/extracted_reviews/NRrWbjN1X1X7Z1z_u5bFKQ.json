My gal pal suggested we visit this venue, as she has seen her friends post pictures of their savoury waffles and was really curious about it. My curiosity was piqued as well. 17 reviews have been written about this place, so I will try to make mine short. We came here for lunch and it wasn't crowded (that's a relief as I prefer quieter places). The service was speedy and nice, with one of the wait staff being really friendly; asking us for our opinion of the dishes that we tried, and volunteering lots of info on the eatery.We had the set lunch $11.90 which included a drink each. Pretty decently priced I must say. I topped up $2 for my much needed latte. My friend and I shared the assam crab waffles, and we really loved it. I must mention the assam sauce that came with this dish - it is da bomb!Very nice, cosy and laid-back environment with cool decor; really enjoyed dining here. Will definitely come back to try the other options, especially since I am a big waffle fan, +++ I still want to try the coconut brew that many reviewers have sang praises of.",

    "text": "Located at Pomo, and occupying units on the first and second floor is Montana. Famed for their freak cakes, and creative savoury and dessert waffles. This cafe has been intriguing my tastebuds since 2014!Check out their newly revamped menu, new items such as Truffle Eggs Rosti $19++, Signature mac & cheese waffle $15++ or Rosso $13++ a dessert made with chocolate brownie and irish whisky sauce are bound to make you curious!Fried Chicken Wings with Garlic Mirin Sauce $12++Fried crispy chicken drumlets and wings with a sweetness on the outside. Reminds me of a certain cafe up in Kovan that serves up really legendary honey parika wings.Truffle Eggs Rosti $19++Are you a truffle fan? Okay if your not that's fine too cause the truffle in this dish is rather subtle. I love my rosti from Marche so that's my standard for rosti, however the rosti here is very different. If you like crispy, rather than soggy McDonald fries, this is for you! Not to mention, 2 beautifully poached eggs with hollandaise sauce, served with parma ham.Signature mac & cheese waffle $15++I'm personally a huge fan of mac and cheese, after spending 5 years in the United States. Also, having been a faithful fan of Montana's signature Mac N Cheese back in the day when they occupied just the first floor. I was shocked to see huge improvement! Glorious mozzarella generous melted over the waffle with truffle oil, real macaroni and cheese embedded in the waffle batter and apparently jalapeno. The jalapeno isn't too spicy, and I'm non-spicy eater. Like I can't even tahan McDonald's chilli sauce, but the tinge of spiciness here was pleasantly savoury. Good job Montana!Baked Salmon with Poached Egg $18++The salmon was pretty good and I found myself digging for the shoyu mushrooms and herbed cous-cous to eat together with the salmon. I love this combination of ingredients. The yuzu hollandaise from the poached egg also gave the salmon fillet some flavour.Rosso $13++This is an alcoholic dessert that is meant for adults. The vanilla ice cream tasted generic but the chocolate brownie was sweet with a tad of bitterness from the dense chocolate flavour. The sourness from the macerated berries was a good balance for the sweet brownie. What blew my mind was the irish wisky sauce that literally brought this dessert to a whole new level!Bianco $13++While glancing through the menu, this dessert caught our attention. Horlicks cheesecake is what the menu read! No joke, the cheesecake base tasted of horlicks. The passionfruit mousse tasted authentically sour with a natural passionfruit aroma. This would be a nice dessert to go with coffee or if you're game for it, ask the staff for a wine-pairing recommendation.V60 Chocolate (Original Mint or Smoky Infusion) $6.80++The first of it's kind in Singapore, Cacao brew made with cacao nibs brewed in coconut water to give you a light, refreshing beverage that looks like tea. Honestly speaking, I could taste the \"tea\" but no \"chocolate\" flavour. Maybe my tongue is to trained to pick up artificial flavours that I can't determine the authentic flavour?8. Cold Crab Truffle Pasta $21++I've never had a good experience with cold angelhair pasta, the noodles are usually always too cold or too soft for my liking. But Montana got in on-point for my tastebuds! Flavourful, al-dente angel hair pasta with crunchy tobiko and chunks of crab meat. Definitely a refreshingly and yet savoury meal, for any time of the day. You will not feel \"jerlat\" or bloated from this pasta dish!Overall : Montana continually tries to improve their menu year after year and they always come up with enterprising new idea to arouse your tastebuds. But there's still some R&D to continue their standard of food.\u00a0*PS never forget to try their cold brew coffee!~",

    "text": "Tucked away in the corner at the second level of POMO centre, you could easily miss this hidden gem. I rarely go to POMO centre, and if I do, I usually just head to the SHINE korean mart on the first level. However, today, I made a purposeful trip to Montana Brew Bar for some coffee.At first glance, the place seemed quite empty save for a gentleman in a business suit nursing a cup of coffee and two students at another corner having lunch, chatting noisily. I wanted to sit at the other section but the manager said that the aircon had broken down for the day and so they had to rely on ceiling fans. It wasn't THAT hot, but I could always use some aircon.Verdict:- Coconut Cold Brew with Gula Melaka*: The sweet notes of gula melaka complemented the slightly bitter taste of coffee very well. The ratio of gula melaka versus the coconut infused coffee was extremely balanced. This drink is so refreshing that I had two glasses! Unbelievable.- Coconut Cold Brew with Yuzu*: Like the previous drink, this was refreshing as well and had a dash of milk added to it. The coconut cold brew paired well with the citrus top notes of orange and yuzu. Another must try!* The coconut cold brew range is Montana Brew Bar's specialty.- Black Truffle Waffles with Fluffy base: It's been a while since I had really good waffles that was fragrant enough and crispy/fluffy at all the right places. I paired the waffle with black sesame ice cream and it's a combination made in heaven. You could choose other ice cream as well but I was craving for some black sesame ice cream. Definitely a must-try!Would definitely return to try some of their main dishes!Tip: go at non-peak hours to avoid Kaplan students.",

I don't recommend the waffles are for sharing as they are THAT good. the only \"downside\" to this place is the price. paid about S$52~ for all, but I will definitely come back again so price is not an issue!",

Their sister arm, Nookie yogurt, on ground floor previously was forever gone. Currently occupied by their new South Bronx burger joint. Montana and Fabulous dough shares the same premises on level 2.My foodie friends and I tried out their new cold brew, a few waffles and pastas. My opinions were:(1) Yuzu-infused Coconut Cold Brew $6.50- The cold brew smells really good with Yuzu fragrance but the zesty taste from Yuzu was too overpowering we almost can't taste the coffee. Blend was smooth but texture too diluted. Rating 2/5(2) Jalape\u00f1o Mac & Cheese Waffles $12- A version 3.0 of Mac & Cheese waffles was reborn! New with more macaroni mixed-in in the waffle mixture, making the entire waffle more filling than before. Love the spiciness from the jalape\u00f1o but overall lack exterior crispiness and it's too mushy inside. Rating 3.5/5(3) Assam Crab Waffles $18- A unique traditional meet modern fusion waffle. This spiced waffle was soft, chewy, and you could taste lemongrass bits in the dough. Chef was quite generous with the portion of crabmeat chunks scattered on top. Assam pur\u00e9e wasn't spicy probably because the sweetness from the canned pineapple cubes mellowed it down. Rating 3/5(4) Bulgogi Beef Waffles $16- Chef cleverly made Korean style waffles filled with rice, cabbage and kimchi to pair with the juicy bulgogi beef. Break the poached egg and trust me, the beef tasted more tender with the yolky flow. A clever twist compared to boring plain waffles we had elsewhere. Rating 3.5/5(5) Truffle Egg Fettucine $16- Al dente fettucine tossed in a pool of savoury cream sauce base. Love the generous amount of mushroom given and the mild lingering truffle smell whenever I fork up the pasta. Although the egg was slightly overdone but it's still my most loved dish for the night. Simple yet savoury. Rating 4.5/5(6) Vodka Crab Penne $16- Sourish tomato based pasta which I don't really fancy. Penne was indeed al dente but we totally can't taste any vodka in this dish. Crabmeat were minimal too. Skip this. *I do love Montana's new modern fusion ideas in cafe food but my personal view, there's definitely room for improvement in taste. There's yet to be a dish where we really WOW nor remember after we leave the place. Staff attitude were definitely good. They were very attentive to our tables and requests were made right :) *",

I had the flat white, and the jalape\u00f1o mac and cheese waffle. The coffee while decent, was slightly more acidic than I preferred. So that was a little disappointing. The waffle's texture was great and there were even bits of macaroni! What would have made it perfect would be if it was oozing cheese instead of a sprinkle on the waffle. I would recommend visiting for the waffles. Shout out to the waitress who came by to ask for feedback before I left. I paid 23 bucks for my meal.",

    "text": "Montana Brew Bar is the little brother of the larger, more comfortable, roomier Roosevelt's Restaurant and Bar (at Outram Park). \u00a0While the food we enjoyed was on par with Roosevelt's - MBB suffers from being housed in a small cramped location on Level 1 of the PoMo Center. \u00a0 PoMo Center is currently at the latter stages of a renovation. \u00a0The Singapore Pools space has been replaced with several small restaurants. \u00a0Most of the new F&B tenants are hoping to appeal to the art school students next door. \u00a0I IMAGINE that when the MBB owners were considering this location, they had concerns over the small space. It's a great size for a coffee shop or a Ya Kun Kaya Toast (next door) but Montana Brew Bar is attempting to be more than that. \u00a0You can't offer a menu like this and then shortchange yourself with a dining space that's too small for its own good. \u00a0Hidden behind a column, Diners order at a cramped counter and are given beepers for food pickup. \u00a0The cramped dining area seats maybe 30 ppl and spills out into the mall. \u00a0They have crammed as many tables and uncomfortable metal stools as possible into the small area. \u00a0While you're eating, guests without tables hover nearby (with tissue packs ready) waiting to chope your seat. No. No. No. Noooo!The Good: \u00a0My Candied Bacon Burger on a brioche bun was a small burger on par with Roosevelts larger $20 burger. \u00a0The sweet bacon really made this unique and the beef was fresh and delicious. \u00a0The Jalapeno Mac and Cheese Waffles and the Chocolate Banana Waffles also got very positive reviews. \u00a0Small portion of Truffle Fries was too small, but good.The Bad: \u00a0Mall dining area is too small and cramped. \u00a0Stools are uncomfortable. \u00a0Lot's of traffic as diners with large bags maneuver for seats, get up and down ordering and picking up the food. +++ The staff does not wait until all of the table's food is ready before beeping you. \u00a0We picked up the 2 burgers 5 minutes before the 2 waffles were ready - which meant we sat and watched our burgers and fries get cold while we waited. \u00a0GOOD SERVICE IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE!!! \u00a0The Singapore government should start an island wide initiative to train amateur restaurant managers on this point: \u00a0Wait until all of a table's food is completed before sending it from the kitchen. \u00a0This \u00a0insures everyone gets their food at the same time! (What a new and unique concept, right?!) \u00a0This process starts in the kitchen. \u00a0If Waffles take longer than burgers, start the burgers later so they finish at the same time. +++The Verdict: \u00a0We are a fan of the food (3.5 / 4 stars). \u00a0The overall experience was cramped and not ideal (1 star). \u00a0They need a larger space. \u00a0I understand the concept is intended to be a smaller, stripped down, \u00a0more budget friendly version of Roosevelt's. But the owners selected the wrong space to set up shop. \u00a0When I hear of a Montana Brew Bar opening in another location, I'll definitely check it out. \u00a0Until then, I'll stick with Roosevelt's.2.5 Stars",

I was actually disappointed when i had my first bite of the matcha strawberryfield waffle. to backtrack a little, the wait wasn't too long and the presentation was decent - a ball of ice cream surrounded by thinly sliced strawberry sitting on top of the waffle that had some condensed milk and tiny balls of citrus flavored syrup drizzled over and in the pockets of the waffle. i think what saved the dessert was the kick that the citrus flavored syrup delivered in the other wise plain waffle item that costed $9.50.one turn off was the utensil and condiment station (though nobody else i observed seemed to be bothered by it) - there were little flies buzzing around and a flurry of activity happens whenever anyone goes to pick up something. for an air conditioned joint, i find it hard to ignore.",

As Melissa Y commented most of the stuffs in regards to the taste and the ingredients, I would like to give my shorter input too :)Spacing wise it is quite compact. The tables were pretty small. You probably have to wait for a space to clear up on a busy day.Among the three waffles we tried, the two that I liked the most are the Truffle Mac & Cheese and Matcha Strawberry Fields. Writing this makes me crave for more waffles. They definitely serve unique waffle types and all of the waffles are crispy. Definitely worth the wait for 15-20 minutes for the waffle to arrive. From far, you couldn't really smell the ingredients of the waffle like the truffle one as it might be due to the open concept seating area. Besides the crispiness of the waffles, the ingredients are chewy especially for the truffle mac and cheese. Yes, have to agree that they did not have much melted cheese in the middle of the waffles which they could probably add more to make it cheesy dish. The dishes portions were more than expected especially when the pricing are considered on the affordable end (less than $10). If we have more rooms for waffles, we would probably add the smores one. Definitely a must go place and it is definitely a walkable distance towards The Cathay. :)",

    "text": "#Waffles the insane trend that is on the Singapore cafe scene right now. Even though it feels like the trend is past its peak, cafes are still hopping on to this train. Well I guess in months to come, only the good ones will still be going strong and my bet is on Montana Brew bar to continue serving us some crispy deliciousness.Let's start with savory first. The Southern fried chicken wafflewich ($10.50) has gone through many versions and I think this may be v2.5 or something. Reviews said that the chicken was dry and it still wasn't improved after all these changes #meh It may have something to do with the bland spice rub on the chicken. Well we'll just give us a juicy buttermilk fillet and that'll do. The spicy southern mustard sauce, which tasted pretty much like tabasco sauce, was pretty good. At least it gave some acidity to the crispy sandwich. I thought that the waffle seemed to be missing some kinda ketchup sorta base or something to gel the dish. The waffles, on their own, were faultless. They remained crispy with every bite even after sitting there for a bit as we carried on with our conversation and got distracted by the other waffles. The Truffle Jalepeno Mac & Cheese ($12.50) invaded our immediate environs with its strong truffle scent. The mac & cheese was folded into the waffle batter and then toasted. We were surprised by the generally sweet batter though (isn't m&c supposed to be salty?). Also we didn't get any of that stringy cheese pull-apart effect that we were expecting. This waffle was softer than the rest of Montana's offerings but we enjoyed the moist and spongy texture. Spice lovers may get a kick from the jalape\u00f1o bits but the chutney sauce that came with it tastes more like a a sweet Indian curry (it had a distinct cumin flavor). Overall, this dish required something salty to cut through the sweetness. Like bacon... Definitely bacon.For sweets, you get a choice of the crispy crunchy waffle or the fluffy, light and chiffon-like center with a gentle crispy crust for their sweet stacks. The limited time availability made us choose the Red Velvet Waffle Stack ($10.50) (which really ran out when we were halfway through our brunch at 12ish) over the Chocolate Banana Waffles ($10.50), a chocolate waffle with caramelised banana, vanilla ice cream, salted caramel sauce and nutella truffle powder. I kinda liked this one actually. It didn't taste anything like red velvet (with the taste of beet) but go for this because it's a really awesome crispy waffle with dulce de leche and dense creamy ice cream (could do with a stronger vanila flavor). We spotted a new flavor which is the Brioche French Toast Waffles ($10.50). I'd hand them my money already. You can also get your caffeine kick at Montana Brew Bar with black coffee going for $3.50 onwards and other espresso based drinks from $4. The Montana House blend is a mix of beans from Brazil San Antonio, Peru Apu and Ethiopia Ardi Sidama beans. It produces a full bodied coffee with a low acidity and was an easy to drink cuppa with dark chocolate notes. Pour-over and aeropress coffee are available as well ($5.20) and you can pick from the Ethiopia YirgaCheffe or the Peru Apu single origin beans. I'd head back to Montana Brew Bar for a decent coffee and perhaps a sweet waffle if i'm in the area. You can't beat great waffles at a great central location.",

    "text": "Montana has renamed itself \"Montana\" and moved to the second floor, in a much larger and more comfortable place with cushioned chairs and sofas, and even carpets. Prices remain in hipster coffee land, but this place has the cred to pull it off. The espresso drinks (starting at $3.80) are, of course, excellent - my favorite is the Gibraltar, which I religiously order every time I come home from abroad - as are the filter single origins, but the baristas keep innovating. The coffee is roasted relatively frequently (I believe it arrives Mondays from Common Man).The flavour of last week was coconut water cold brew, either on its own (with a coconut water ice ball, naturally) or in a cocktail glass with gula melaka. I must admit that it's probably a better fit for the Asian palate, I'll stick to hot drinks, but the presentation was faultless and the concept innovative and interesting - I'm glad to have paid $6.80 even without finishing the drink, if that makes sense. I even appreciate the $8 they charge for carbonated drinks, to encourage the customer to purchase something prepared on the premises instead!The menu has evolved as well; they now offer pastas (at the usual hipster cafe price of $18) as well as their waffle specialties, which are amply reviewed here. Maybe worth trying some day, although at 2/3 of the price of a set lunch in Bistro du Vin, not yet for me.",
