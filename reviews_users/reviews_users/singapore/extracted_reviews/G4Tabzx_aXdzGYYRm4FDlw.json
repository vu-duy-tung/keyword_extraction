    "text": "This is my go to place for delicious nasi lemak. The rice is really infused with coconut flavor and is not overly strong. The flavor also does not taste synthetic like some other places. I will suggest to just get the nasi lemak and maybe a lemongrass drink. That is light and refreshing. The nasi lemak comes with sambal (not too sweet or spicy), fried egg with runny yolk (not all the time), cucumber, crunchy ikan bilis and peanuts and two pieces of fried chicken. The fried chicken is yummy, the best thing next to the rice. The side dishes are ok, not that special or fantastic to warrant the prices. Same for the desserts. It gets crowded fast, so you will only be seated if everyone is your group is there.",

For chicken it is only chicken thigh, no other choice. Comes with sambal.For fish today it is selar fish. It has just the right texture. Not overcooked like it so often is at Hawker stalls. Black sauce with onions and chilli is so good.Kueh salat has a strong taste of I can't quite make out what (coconut?). Not as good as Chalk Farm's.Chendol has a lot of gula melaka. Okay, not great.Ice lemongrass drink. Not nice.",

    "text": "Much-hyped new nasi lemak joint in town. Pretty good, but overall it just felt like something was missing... maybe it lacked a bit of kick. Chicken was great, but the rice could've been a bit more flavourful. Chilli was probably the weak spot here. The chendol came highly recommended as well, but just tasted too sweet as a whole. The homemade jelly was a nice touch though! Service was pretty good... we were lucky to arrive at 1140 and be seated immediately, but come any later and be prepared for a 20-30 minute wait. I think I'll be back, but hope they keep tinkering with the formula!",

    "text": "Despite the price tag and what I thought would be too hipster to be good, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at The Coconut Club! Of course, I still thought it was utterly overpriced, but for a nice restaurant in Club Street with a/c and yummy food? Aiight, I'll pay for it.I went on a Friday night and got a seat right away which is a nice change for Club Street that's always bustling and with people spilling onto the street. Service was fairly prompt, and it would have been nice to have the specials on the board instead of me having to ask if the menu was all there is to it and then the server then filling in the gaps on their specials of the day.I ordered the nasi lemak (of course) and the sayur lemak (which is apparently the less creamy version of sayur lodeh - it certainly tasted that way too) which was one of the specials. The nasi lemak came out looking delicious! The rice was coconut-y and fragrant, the egg was a nice oozy crisp, the ikan bilis was fried without being too hard, the chilli was a little too much on the spicy side (and just not as delicious as the one at Adam Road) and the chicken was glorious. The chicken was a full thigh and drumstick, was marinated in this delicious marinade (lots of local herbs - lemongrass and the like) and fried to juicy perfection. Yum. The sayur lemak had a really good broth - possibly ikan bilis? I made the unfortunate mistake of mixing all the chilli into it and ended up sniffling my way through my meal although it was really quite delicious. Although they also serve alcohol, my dining companion and I both got the lemongrass tea which was serviceable.This was all-in-all a very satisfying meal, and although I might still return to Adam Road for my nasi lemak fix (at a much lower price point too), I wouldn't say no to anyone asking me to get nasi lemak if I were ever in the Club Street area.",
