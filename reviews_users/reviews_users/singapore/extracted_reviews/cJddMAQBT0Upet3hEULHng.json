    "text": "What makes an amazing dinner the perfect meal?When the company is better than the food!A BIG thank you to Nik T and Van Z for your warmest Singaporean hospitality. \u00a0Thank you for everything! \u00a0Although we didn't get to watch the sunset as planned, the innocent-looking drink that put me to sleep more than made up for the sunset ^_^A shout-out to Alvin C - it was a great pleasure meeting you!Now to JB Ah Meng.The moment you walk in, you can't help but notice the huge posters on the walls highlighting the visit by World renowned Michelin 3-starred chef , Ferran Adria. \u00a0Other well-known celebrities who have dined there include Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain.But alas! \u00a0This restaurant had no opulent furniture, no crystal chandelier, and no servers in black tuxedos to welcome some of the World's most famous chefs!JB Ah Meng, until about a year and a half ago, was a hawker-stand style eatery with crowded outdoor tables located in a dark and narrow alley. \u00a0They have now moved into an air-conditioned cafe-style restaurant space which is a lot more comfortable (at least for me, but some would say the food tasted better or the atmosphere was more authentic in the old alley location.)WHITE PEPPER CRAB: \u00a0Crab is almost like the signature cuisine of Singapore and the three most popular culinary versions are: \u00a0Chili, black pepper, and white pepper. \u00a0JB Ah Meng specializes in (and is famous for) the white pepper rendition and it was finger-licking good. \u00a0The white pepper flavor was rich and exotic but not overwhelming. The crab meat tasted fresh and was flavorful.TIP: \u00a0When you make your table reservation, you need to reserve your crabs at the same time. \u00a0Otherwise, you might be disappointed. \u00a0(Thanks, Nik!)SALTED EGG PRAWN BALL: \u00a0If you like Chinese salted egg, then this dish will almost be heavenly for you! \u00a0Fresh prawns and corn were dipped in a salted egg batter and deep fried to perfection. \u00a0The rich salted egg yolk flavors added a bold dimension to natural taste of the fresh shrimps and turned this rather simple-looking dish into a most memorable yummy experience.FRIED GARLIC CHILI \u00a0LALA: \u00a0Lala are Southeast Asia clams. \u00a0Compared to the Pacific clams that we have here on the West Coast (and especially the Pacific Northwest), the lala were smaller, less meaty, but were packed with robust flavors and a distinct seafood \"sweetness\" that is rare outside of Asia. \u00a0They were fried with an abundance of red hot chili peppers which stimulated the palate and made the lalas super delicious.STEAMED PEARL GROUPER TAIL: \u00a0This was a giant fish and we ordered the tail portion which was already plenty of fish for us. \u00a0It was steamed Hong Kong style and was served with the most delicious soy sauced based juice which retained all the flavors and essence of the fish. \u00a0JB SAN LOU MEE HOON: \u00a0This might look like the least appetizing dish of the night, but let me assure you that if you are fortunate enough to grab a reservation at JB Ah Meng, then this dish is a must-order. \u00a0Mee hoon in American English is rice vermicelli, which you can easily find in most authentic Asian restaurants in Irvine or the SGV. \u00a0But I guarantee you that I've never had fried rice vermicelli this good outside of Asia. The most memorable part of this dish was the \"fragrance of the wok\" (or wok hei) that was so rich that the entire table was filled with a sweet aroma the moment this dish was served.",

I also tried the garlic chili clams, fried beehoon, snake beans with lotus root, and salted egg prawn balls - all so yummy! I wish I could cook like this but sadly I will have to travel 9500 miles to eat this again. So sad...",

All for heartland eating but definitely did not enjoy the waitress constantly brushing me aside to write an order down on the table. Definitely could do better but do not expect too much in terms of service. Maybe it was I who did not voice out my displeasure with being brushed against with a wet arm. Great food and great price though!",

Get this and be happy 3) salted egg prawn with corn - I have never tasted anything like this, I would order this for a try and the corn is addicting. 4) fish skin with pickled veggies - not my fave nth people like it5) fried eggplant and potatoes - really enjoyed this with the sauce and combo of potatoes and eggplant",

And Geylang is awesome.Their signature dishes are the 'san lou bee hoon' (which isn't in any way like 'san lou hor fun' btw -- different 'lou'). Also known as \"three storeys bee hoon\". It's not like any beehoon you've ever had. It's fried, with all the lovely 'wok hei' bits, and it's flat. Flattened like a pancake. I don't know why. But it's great.The salted egg prawn balls are gorgeous too, with little bits of corn in the batter. The fried fish skin. OMG. And the white pepper crabs!",
