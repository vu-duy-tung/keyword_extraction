    "text": "Happened to pass by looking for something to eat & decided to try this out. Am not really a fan of Mexican food but worth a try for their nachos & tacos which looked good on the menu. Location 4/5------------Located at level 1 of 313 Somerset, just at the Somerset mrt entrance on the way to Orchard Gateway. Food 3.5/5----------The chicken nachos ($15) portion is fine for 1 person or even shared with 2. Lots of guacamole but not much cheese. 3.5/5Tuesdays are taco days where you get 1 taco with chips & a drink for $10. Doesn't really feel like value for money when you can order their normal tacos (4 pieces) for $18 instead. Go for the fish (baja) tacos which is nice and crispy. 4/5The pork carnitas taco were so-so, so I'd suggest skipping it and trying something else. 3/5Atmosphere 3.5/5-----------------Open & airy. Can be a bit loud with the human traffic walking past. The tables & chairs are placed quite close to each other so be prepared to bump into things while navigating your way through this ~50 seater restaurant. WiFi is free is you surrender your email so you can receive updates from them.",

I understand that being in Orchard is expensive, but it just didn't add up... The rice they used is also somewhat dry as were the beans in burrito, taco and burrito bowl form! I will admit I have a high standard for Latin food as I grew up with a Latina mother, but honestly the dry flavourless beans were really off putting. I could excuse the rice but not the beans. SORRY NOT SORRY. I was glad that they had Jarritos soda though! Sucks that it wasn't included in the meal deal they had... Their corn chips and salsa were probably the best thing on the menu... Also to note: the night I went was only their 5th night of being open!! And as a result they ran out of chicken!!",

    "text": "Pros: LocationBarrio by Mex Out is conveniently located at 313 @ Somerset. The restaurant faces the entrance of Somerset MRT station.Cons: Food The burrito is way too dry, bland and painful to eat, I gave up eating halfway. It's that bad. A burrito should have Mexican rice in it, NOT flavourless and plain basmati rice. It was so bland (especially the flavourless black beans) that I had to ask for salsa approximately 5 times. The portions are really, really stingy, even for the +$2 guacamole. For the price I'm paying, I can get better quality and bigger portions of more authentic Mexican food elsewhere. The mushroom burger (which my friend ordered) had apparently too much guac which, as a result, overpowered the rest of the burger. The Mexican fries was nothing special. It was essentially soggy fries peppered with paprika; no sauce, nothing. The Coke was way too diluted and had no fizz. The salsa is way too watery - it is essentially tabasco sauce, I suspect. Appearance-wise: The salsa is masquerading as chicken rice chilli sauce. My experience at Barrio by Mex Out left me asking myself, how is this even considered a restaurant standard? The standard and quality of food is really, really low. It tastes nothing like food prepared with love, or much thought. Just a small handful of ingredients thrown together in some random assortment. Don't be fooled by the fact that they have 4 outlets on the island. It (mushroom burger, nachos, Mexican fries, burrito wrap with guacamole) was definitely not worth my $60 at all. The food at Barrio by Mex Out is totally overpriced and lacks quality. I wouldn't even say the food is average. You've been warned. Overall, I was left feeling extremely disappointed and won't be back ever again. The food is neither cheap, nor good. Much better Mexican restaurants exist elsewhere in Singapore, like Cha Cha Cha for instance",

I just couldn't get down with their original location in CBD, but with this shiny new outlet, it was just too hard too avoid.What I liked:- Great location on the ground floor of 313@Somerset. It is money, with tons of foot traffic.- Bright decor and fun music that's reminiscent of Robertson Quay's Super Loco (no relation.) It looks like the place to be.What was okay:- The carne asada burrito. The flavours were good, it wasn't overly salted, and it wasn't dry. However, I'm still questioning their ingredient choices: why would you include roasted mushrooms???What I didn't like:- They offered a spicy chicken burrito, but not a mild one. I prefer chicken burritos, but I can't handle spice.- Chips and guacamole were unavailable as sides. Sigh.- There's an empty space next to the restaurant filled with cactuses (cacti?) Not sure what the story is with this space but I wish they could've just put more seating instead.TL;DR: Food is decent and prices are to be expected. Not something I would queue for; but if there's availability and you're craving Mexican food, this will work!",

With an outdoor seating area nestled next to a pathway with heavy human traffic and decked out with fairy lights and industrial decor, the atmosphere is fun and thriving. Sadly, the food fell far from expectations and I am resigned to the fact that Singaporeans just haven't seem to have conquered the magic of tacos and quesadillas. The Mexican Street Corn was four medium pieces of char-grilled corn cob coated with butter, mayo and paprika. You have to get your hands dirty for this one but it's worth it. The corn could have been juicier but it makes for a decent starter. The tacos is where Barrio really drops the ball. The fish tacos were utterly disappointing. The fish itself was soggy and flavourless and the accompanying wrap was tough. The flavours were forgettable. The beauty of Mexican food is in the marriage of contrasting flavours coming together and trust me, there was none of that in this sloppily put together dish. Similarly, the vegetarian tacos was nothing to shout home about. The guacamole was flat, the tomato-onion filling was terrible and everything was just clumsily put together. How can a Mexican restaurant not have good guacamole? Appalling!The quesadillas were OK in that they had cheese and cheese makes everything better. Yet, again, the flavours were just lacking. If one has never had Mexican food, they might be forgiven for thinking that this is the standard. However, having had cheaper, far more delicious Mexican fare in London, this was a gigantic disappointment.",

I ordered it at the server's recommendation, who said it was one of the most popular dishes. The rice was very dry, the black beans were unseasoned, and the chicken was bland and dry as well. I asked for hot sauce on the side which helped cut some of blandness. The food and atmosphere are not worth their price point though. I'd be more forgiving if it was $7-$10. But at ~$15 (including gst) for an a la carte dish, it only gets 2 stars.",

While heading to the counter to make payment, I had to squeeze through some seats (narrow seating). My order came within the 5 minutes upon ordering. It came in a brown bag and the burrito was wrapped in an aluminium foil.Ate it approximately one hour later. Taste wise, it was just nice. The tortilla skin was not thick enough so i made a mess after gulping down a few bites. The rice was pretty chewy and the beef was a little on the tough side. Would prefer it to be more moist on the inside. Portion wise it was alright to fill my cravings. Love the black beans as it added the texture and chewiness for the burrito.For its price, it was a bit on the expensive side. Definitely good for quick bites if you are in a rush ;)",
