I have been to Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong (North Point branch) and their menu is more extensive than this branch in Singapore and I honestly believe their food is better compared to this place. Be sure to get their baked char siew pork buns though, they are to die for!",

There was a queue at THW but moved rather quickly. We ordered a whole bunch of their dim sum including their promotion specials - fried dry Hor Fun with chicken and prawns. What we had and verdict - Glutinous rice in lotus leaf - very good Har gow - $6 for 4 is quite expensive and on par with Chinese restaurants in hotels. That said, it was competently done with thin skin and crunchy shrimp filling. Siew Mai - same feedback as the Har Gow. Malay cake - fluffy soft and not too sweet. Wu Kok with Chili crab filling - interesting. Not badSpinach and shrimp dumpling - loved this with its chewy transparent skinShrimp Cheong fun - decentCheong fun with sesame sauce - won't order this again as its quite boring and the sesame sauce was on the stingyHot tea is chargeable but refillable.",

UnderwhelmedDISCLAIMER: we got there at 2am so the supper menu was available (which is not as extensive as their regular menu) but it made such an impact, this is the first and last time ill ever visit a tim ho wan.Also, they asked us for our last order at 230am, so not quite sure if they 24 hrs everyday. Pl call ahead to check. We had the fish porridge, beef brisket noodles, har gow, chicken feet, veggie of the day (poached lettuce) and shrimp/pork wrapped in beancurd skinOf all the dishes, we liked the veggies the best!!!Har kow prawns were big/fresh but skin was chewy.Beancurd skin was also chewy. The beef brisket was very tender but tasteless, as was its Soup. The porridge was average and the chicken feet is braised, so if youre expecting the usual chicken feet dim sum dish (which we were), youll be disappointedAll in all, it cost us close to $50.You are better off heading to swee choon for your late night dim sum fix. We only ended up at tim ho wan cause it was a tues and swee choon was closed",

As you can see, there's not much photo of food as THERE'S NOTHING NICE that deserve a space in my photo. I will say it's just an overpriced hype food that will be going out of fashion soon.I have given this place, different branches, a few chances. I will say, it's really nothing fantastic. Save the calories for other more deserving food.I will give this place zero star for the food. The saving grace is the service. The serving staff comes with additional bowls and soup without us asking for it. So this 1 star is for the excellent service staffs that they have.",

This outlet is good as the queues aren't that crazy. Food taste authentic and true to the taste of their HK flagship store which i tasted. I was really dissapointed at their congee, tasted really bland. I would say that the food in general is a good bang for the buck but the French should try a couple more Dim Sum joints and they will realuse that they will be dishing stars to many other Dim Sum places.",
