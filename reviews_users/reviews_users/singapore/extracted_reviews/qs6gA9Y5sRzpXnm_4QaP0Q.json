Mango-shrimp salad was good, tangy , and to the kids delight generous of mango slices. Craft beers on the menu was a refreshing choice, went with the recommended magic hat #9 ale and was to my liking. Grub burger was good , as was the salted egg chicken wings. Churros at the end was crispy fresh with not too sweet vanilla and choc sauce. \u00a0Perfect w/ the smooth cappuccino.",

Honestly, I can go to Cantonese zi char stores with better service. For the price they charge for the meal, I do hope they do hire better people, or invest in service training. Because this place potentially has all the hallmarks of a place Yelpers want to go to regularly.",

Ordered a cheese double burger, a rainbow cake and a chicken steak. Their cheese burger is awesome as recommended. Chicken steak was not bad but the mashed potato was too much. Their rainbow cake was real sweet too. Too much sweet. Sugar icing too much? Total cost $40+. Quite expensive. Their service was good. Don't need to wait too long for anything ordered. But won't be visiting if on budget though",

    "text": "It is probably a 3.5 stars place. Maybe it was the examination period for the children, but there was no queue when we got there at 1130am. A few tables outside were available. We sat outside as it was a cool day. And despite the thunder and lightning, there was no rain. When we were there, Mediacorp was filming at the pond nearby. That kept the children entertained, as they went there to watch the filming, as well as to run around the park. The only bad thing about being seated near the washroom area was the kitchen vent nearby. You could smell the oiliness oozing out from the vent as well as the heat from it. Otherwise it was all good. Service was excellent. The staff did not chase us out even after we finished our food, and were very friendly. They told us not to mind them as they went about cleaning the place after the kitchen was closed and we were still welcome to stay at our table. Water glasses were refilled ever so often, or you could always help yourself to the water or send the kids to fill the glasses. Hehe. As a casual and family friendly dining establishment, it is great that they do not frown on the children popping in and out. Parents could watch the children running and playing in the park while they are eating. Prices have increased now. I was told the prices were kept low (under $12) as it was part of the NParks requirement in the tender for F&B to be affordable to the public using the park. So I do not know how it works since the prices have gone up slightly for some dishes, but not all. We ordered quite a fair bit of dishes and those I tried I liked. A dish which MUST order is the churros. While it is true that the cinnamon taste could be stronger, I am fine with the mild taste and generous coating of sugar. It is not super sweet and you could always remove the sugar if you like it with no sugar. I like how churro is hot and crispy on the outside. The dips are ok, dark chocolate is a bit too liquid so it tends to drip. The creme anglaise has a hint of lemon in it. The truffle egg cocotte has a strong truffle smell and taste which makes it really yummy. Unfortunately the parma ham is just a teeny tiny sliver which has no taste at all. The best looking brunch dish would be the French toast with garlic pork sausage, strawberries, sour cream and maple syrup. It tastes good too. The beef and guinness pie just looked very sad. Beef piled on top a pastry puff. Apparently the taste is bad too. The Grub cheeseburger is also very average. The crispy fish burger is the best of the lot. The Grub breakfast set is also not fabulous when compared to other places serving similar food. Roasted portobello is ok, you can't really go wrong with it though the rocket looks very wilted. I guess the food is hit and miss, depends on what you order. The iced honey lime juice is a misnomer as it comes with lemon juice. Too sour and acidic for the stomach. I think I am used to the less acidic taste of lime juice now. But if you want to dine at a casual place in the midst of greenery, I guess Grub is a good option.",

    "text": "I'm adding this to my list of unimpressive brunch places - and this one is rather akin to the experience I had at the fabulous baker boys. both are located in rather beautiful buildings in a park-type environment, both have the same brunch hype going for it, and both didn't quite live up to potential.I came here in a large group of 10, so I think it's safe to say we traversed most of the menu - and also safe to say that it wouldn't be far off to say that this review is therefore informed. most of the dishes we had are here - but I'm going to skip the verbose this morning.the breakfast dishes suffered from a state of mere passableness - that includes their breakfast plates, french toast, and eggs cocotte. that last one, in particular, was also afflicted with a a state also known as rawness. it had to be returned, and even then came back only slightly lukewarmer than at its first appearance.the better ones were the burgers. a crispy fish burger came as a large fillet sticking out two fluffy buns, and the beef variant was both hefty and juicy - quite a good iteration for a cafe.have you seen that tiny green pickle at the edge of the board though? it came as a side to the burger, and was really that size. so cute! and so.. weird that their nominal pickle would be so truly nominal.I forget to give a shout-out to the beef and guinness pie, which prefaces this post - this was a delicious deconstructed do, with braised beef and soft carrots topping a crispy puff of pastry. pretty delicious this one, and probably the best thing on the menu.I wasn't excited by any of the deserts either. my sticky date pudding was more like a kueh topped with ice cream; a dense, chewy (almost like an uncooked unrisen cake), mass of starc that can barely pass for cake. I managed a couple of spoonfuls, but that was about it.the dark chocolate pot was essentially a pot of ganache - nothing wrong with that, of course, but I expected a little more finesse and a slightly more varied texture. that spicy cashew praline was a lightly chilli-spicy sandy, sugary mix - kind of interesting on the menu, but too reminiscent of sugar to eat too much of.the churros were also a bit dense, though the chocolate and creme anglaise it came with was decent at least. the best churros I've had are the disneyland ones - with crisp exteriors and fluffy interiors - and I can't seem to get to any restaurants or cafes which provide the same.so.. there's that. it's a pretty long walk through the park, and definitely not the easiest place to get to. I suggest getting your GPS on, as we lost our way and it was mad sweltering. I wish it had been a better experience - much like those I've seen on reviews when it first opened to large crowds - but what can you do?",

I have been here a total of three times and the service here has been consistently good. The staff were attentive and took time to answer our questions about the food, people, etc. In my most recent visit during lunch, I ordered the beef burger which comes with the fries. It was so-so for me. \u00a0The churros were a saving grace. It was well done- crispy and light. It was a perfect ending to the meal. I personally feel that the lunch menu is a little bit too limited and prefer the dinner menu.",

    "text": "Grub is pretty new to the restaurant scene, so I suppose some allowance ought to be made for them in this review. Having said that, I think that this quaint little eatery in the park is perfectly...adequate. Adequate because their staff are not familiar with the menu and are not intuitive about things like filling empty water glasses or knowing when to remove plates, but they are enthusiastic and ask for feedback. Adequate because the food leans toward the Americana but I don't know if anyone in the kitchen has ever been to America or been trained in preparing authentic American fare, and the quality of product is average...but it is tasty if you're not expecting authenticity or high-end cuts of meat. I suppose for a neighborhood park restaurant, one really can't complain all that much. The food is very reasonably priced, the ambiance is lovely, and they are canine friendly. I truly hope that my experience tonight was purely due to opening jitters, because there is so much potential for the place. Tried:Chili Con Carne (under $10)Risotto (Around $10)Steak and Fries (Under $20)",

Due to the heat wave that is going on these days we decided to sit indoors - more cooling.I was introduced to this place by a close friend and she tried the food and said it was good. The menu was one page laminated and I had to check on yelp on what's good to eat based on previous comments. I was baffled with fish burger or pork burger and I decided to try the pork one since I love grilled pineapples on top of my burger - reminds me of Islands in California.For the drink lime honey juice caught my eyes. The server came promptly to take our orders and repeated our orders once again to confirm.The drink came first. It is different from the normal lime juice I had outside. The honey is just right and the lime juice wasn't too sour or sweet for my taste - just right I could say.The food that we ordered came after awhile. I tried the fish burger and the cheeseburger as well as my own pork burger. Overall I still like the one I ordered. Tangy after taste.There were fries as the side dish. It is crunchy and not salty. There was a small serving of chilli sauce that came with it but I thought it was tomato sauce instead till I tried it. Overall it is a good place and quiet place to enjoy dinner. The price is a little pricey but I was very satisfied with the meal. Bon appetit! I'll definitely come back if I got a chance :)",

    "text": "First impression of their mushroom risotto: Chinese porridge with marmite, with spring onion garnish. Don't get me wrong, I love porridge and I love marmite. So I like this dish in general, but it is not a risotto. Truffled egg cocotte is a great appetizer for people who like runny egg with bread. Like an angmo style of our kopitiam half-boiled egg. The other main course we tried was the slow roasted pork belly. This is different from the usual interpretation. The pork belly is all soft and yummy inside, and instead of the regular crisp from the skin, this is coated with a light layer of flour and fried. Thus, you get the whole pork belly crisp on the outside, all gelatinous goodness (also read as fats) inside. We like it enough, but didn't like the mango sauce was it was drizzled with. Next time, I would do it without the sauce. Dessert: most people are here for the churros. Yummy version here that is freshly fried upon ordering, fluffy and crispy. Given that not many places in Sg serves this, this is a good find. The only grip I have is the chocolate sauce that comes with it. They should have used better quality chocolate. This tasted cheap and it made an otherwise great dessert fall short.No reservations taken and the wait can be quite long. Good thing it is located in the park so you can go walk around while you wait. Get mozzie spray though, I filled quite many happy mozzie tummies while waiting.",

    "text": "Pretty decent food marred by bad service.We went to Grub for dinner. The food was actually pretty tasty - we had burgers and the pork belly. Only the churros were disappointing - poorly fried so the inside was too wet and stodgy, and the chocolate sauce that comes with it had that cheap not-really-chocolate taste. Bleah :(The wait staff were nice and all, but service was bad. It made me wonder: were they even trained? The restaurant was pretty full for dinner, but the whole time, a whole cluster of wait staff just kept standing by the entrance, chatting away. They never paid attention to their tables, never came by to see if we needed anything, and never filled up our water glasses unless we waved madly at them. Our original waitress never even came back. There seemed to be only one guy that bothered, and he ran around doing all the work while the girls just stood around.We were also encouraged to order dessert up front so that we wouldn't have to wait so long. Guess what - we had to remind them twice about our dessert and we did wait a long time.It's really a shame. I liked the venue and the food wasn't bad at all. I won't go back for the bad service.",

    "text": "I must confessed that I was grubby when I had to queue at 5.30pm sharp when the restaurant officially opens for dinner. Not that I was late. People had been queuing before the door opens. The no-reservation policy can be a frustration for people who travel far to this park for the food. If I had not lived nearby, I would skip my 45-min wait and head nearby for roti prata. So here's our dinner: The Chilli con Carne ($8) was a simple appetizer of corn chips served with a stew of grass-fed beef chuck meat and beans. Served with sour cream and homemade green chimichurri, the blend of spices is weak and won't set your tongue ablaze.Main courses range from mediocre to good. The Smoked Pork Belly ($15) was the first to be delivered to our tables. On a bed of smooth mash potato, mango sauce and cherry tomatoes, the orange block of meat is like a body-builder with a gentle soul. With a right ratio of fats to meat, it neither overwhelms with grease nor engage the teeth in a laborious sawing job.On the other hand, the Pan Fried Salmon $15 seemed like reinventing the wheel with a different protein. Old friends like the mash potato (replaced the unavailable risotto) and the green chimichurri (from the Chilli Con Carne appetizer) met again to greet the salmon.Yet, another fish was terrific. The Crispy Fish Burger $12 was constructed with a perfectly deep-fried golden monkfish served on a bright, tart remoulade sauce. Fish varies daily so you may get cod or hake. We tried nearly everything on the dessert menu: Churros ($9) did not excite with any cinnamon aroma. The amount of sugar coating could have decreased, unlike those described in earlier online reviews. But the chocolate sauce was served cold, resulting in a rather glumpy, odd taste. My threshold for chocolate was put to the test by the chocolate pot $8 (see top pic). It would be mission impossible to wipe off the extremely dense bittersweet ganache without the spicy cashew praline crumbles. Though the Belgian waffles ($8) are not the crunchiest ones but at least, it had a sturdy structure with some slight browned edges and fluffy interior. Thankfully, the hazelnut ice cream came in a generous scoop to pair with the unsweetened dough. \u00a0The food here are normal western fare which can be found outside a park so patience is the key if one really wants to dine in here. So the next time if I return for brunch, I would be dressed in my sports attire and go jogging to kill the time.",

    "text": "Very new on the Singapore scene but already super popular as evidenced by the 45min - 1 hour wait we were quoted last Sunday at 1pm. Given last food orders are at 2pm, the wait staff were skeptical as to whether we would even get a chance to order... It was actually only a 25 minute wait so I guess Grub still need to work on their guesstimates on timing. I really like the space although I think the outdoor area has room for more seating. Funky industrial-chic with exposed brick. There is a large industrial kitchen full of kitchen staff and then a random open plan kitchen in the corner of the restaurant which they use for cleaning glasses and also patrons can sit at the counter to eat. Menu is very pub grub, diner-style fare. I did like the penchant for NZ beverages in there :-)We tried the cheeseburger, pork burger and the \"not yet on the menu\" chocolate mousse in a pot. I really enjoyed the cheeseburger, the pork burger was tender and tasty, and the dessert was a winner. The chocolate mousse was more of a ganache with a crunchy chilli-sweet crumb to mix in with it. Coffee was remarkably bad. Hence why I would call this place an 'eatery' rather than a 'cafe' given its inability to serve passable coffee. The honey and lime and juice was refreshing though. Service was still quite 'fresh' but enthusiastic and friendly. Water glasses were filled every now and again. Total bill approx $45 for two? The dinner menu looks a bit more varied (beyond burgers and eggs and waffles) and good value. I would be keen to go back to try it, although \u00a0I do find the location a bit out of the way and given you can't book... i might be taking a bit of a gamble to eat! Worth a look but perhaps go earlier on the weekends.",

Both burgers are okay, I mean you really get what you pay for and the portion is good...if you want to have space for dessert.The thing that really impressed us was the fries!! All burgers are served with fries and wow the fries are really fresh and crispy and tasty! Honestly I eat A LOT of fries and Grub's fries are one of the better ones in town.We also had an iced honey lemon juice ($2.5) and this was weird. The honey taste is strong, the lime taste is strong, but there is a strange and lingering after taste!!Ended our meal with the Churros ($8) that EVERY single table seemed to have ordered. Maybe my boyfriend and I were too full but the law of diminishing returns set in after the second churro...... they're so heavy and so sweet. Turns out we are not churro people :(Anyway, this place is worth a try!! We stayed till 9.30pm (last order is at 9.45) but the place was still packed!! We were quite shocked that it's a weekday night in the middle of a dark park but there were still so many people waiting for a table and every table was occupied.I will definitely go back to try other things on their menu :) maybe you can say hi through my instagram photos at Grub hahahha!",

    "text": "I had the mentaiko fries with their signature cheeseburger followed by churros. the mentai fries was interesting change from the usual truffle fries. But these fries were oversalted considering that the accompanying mentaiko cream was also quite salty. Their cheese burger was underwhelming as the beef patty lacked a char flavour and was undersized compared to the bun it was served in. The flavour of the burger was just too ordinary and does not warrant any high praise. Th hightlight of my meal was the churros served with creme anglais and chocolate sauce. Good balance of crispyness and breadiness which went well with the accomoanying sauce. Perfect pairing with the coffee brewed at this place.",

    "text": "The Brunch Club reunites! And being a brunch club... we had to eat a lot of the menu. Just to try right? Josh, Ricky, Michelle and Sonya were the most adventurous - was it four dished or five amongst them? Pancakes, the burger, and a bunch of desserts including churros and a sticky date pudding, they had them all. Me? Just the french toast please. Two slices, a little syrup, sour cream(?) and mascerated strawberries(also ?) and a sausage - simple food, and tasty enough, so no complaints, but I'm not writing a postcard about them either. The Girlfriend's eggs en cocotte was a little underdone for our liking, and after reporting it to the staff, it came back similarly raw, so we gave it a go, but it was unsatisfying in my book. I'm trying something else next time.",

    "text": "We live near Grub and finally managed to get a table on early Friday evening. The way they seat people is new (strictly no reservation and on a first come first serve basis), but to be honest it makes perfect sense for as many people as possible to enjoy this nice place and no tables remain empty for long. \u00a0We had the Grub burger and a few nice Monteith's beers from New Zealand. \u00a0All very nice and the price is reasonable also and it is funny to think back how the Bishan park used to look a few years ago. \u00a0A different world now and with such modern stylish restaurant, the park has progressed even further.",

They have an interesting electronic queuing system which messages you when your seat is ready. Very nice. I like the look and feel of this plave. But the food was very average. We had a grub breakfast and a portobello mushroom set. It was expensive and portions tiny. Coffee was very average too. Though latte was good. Overall, nice look and feel. Expensive, crowded. Very average food. Might come again as I live near but seems a little over priced.",
