I mean, non of the MRT stations are near it... Service: very busy restaurant on a Sunday. Everyone was waiting for a seat while several tables were reserved and empty. Food came relatively quickly but servers were not paying much attention to us. Food: great ideas but lacked the delivery punch. I really wanted the salted egg yolks fries, travelled for them. But the fries were too thin and crispy and had not enough potato in them..I also had the salted egg yolk crab pasta. The sauce was too liquidy so you can't taste much salted egg yolk in them. Pasta itself was a little too cooked. The soft shell crab was tasty though. I had the fizzy sunrise to drink, which reminded me of cough syrup. Boo. My sister had the pork roulade. I love the melted cheese but the dish didn't have enough balance so it got too much after a while. Overall, average cafe. Will not travel the distance again to get ok only food...",

    "text": "I have heard plenty of good things about Arbite so I am sorely disappointed when I finally get the chance to go there for brunch. It should have come with a warning - bring ear plugs. The place was crowded on Saturday late morning, filled with kids and young adults. Maybe it was the clientele too as my friend said it was not so noisy during dinner even when it was full house. We could hardly hear ourselves talk, we could hear conversations from people around us, turning us into unintentionally eavesdroppers. When the children threw tantrums or when the babies wailed, and the parents did nothing about it, you just want to walk out or talk to the parents. I guess concrete walls and stark furnishings just do not help in managing the acoustics factor of the place. We had the Arbite breakfast which was filled with everything you want. Unfortunately half the food was cold, and the strong air conditioning blowing directly on the food did not help either. The bacon was awful, tasted like it was cooked in old oil, and it was very greasy. It left a heavy oily feeling in the guts. Needless to say, I did not finish the food. We left quickly as the din was just too much and went elsewhere to have a much needed cup of coffee.",

The patty was moist and still slightly pink. The sunny side up egg was cooked just right and oozed when broken to add to the flavour with the crisply fried onion rings adding a nice crunch to each bite. The fries aren't the usual skinny type but cut from whole potatoes and fried. My meal was completed with the delicious lychee freeze.",

Not out of a can for sure. 2) Seared Seabass in cream sauce - expected fishy taste but it was actually very delightful. Flavourful but not heavy with the cream sauce. 3) Baked Seafood Pasta - fresh ingredients with the pasta done al dente. Though I found the pasta slightly bland, easily fixed with a few dash of salt. 4) Hamburger - daughter had that she liked it enough. \u00a05) Cheesecake - these came complimentary because my daughter was enjoying her lunch with such looks of happiness. Haha... Cheesecake was nice enough. Not the heavy type without losing the flavour. Will return if in the area.",

That is, until I met Arbite. Possibly one of the best brunch places I've experienced in Singapore, everything we sampled here was delicious. I got the Hearty Breakfast but some of the other things I tried were the Eggs Benedict, the Smoked Salmon Crossiant and Truffle Fries. All delicious. The Hearty Breakfast was everything I wanted in a breakfast, the toast was perfect, thick and buttery, the eggs and sausage were well fried, as were the mushrooms and tomato. The bacon wasn't too crispy nor too soft and the potato balls were a nice welcomed addition.The Eggs Benedict was done with \u00a0prosciutto instead of regular ham, and together with the eggs and hollandaise sauce, it made for a simple yet yummy meal. The Truffle Fries were thick (if that's how you like your fries) and came with some sort of dip. The service was good and while this place lacks a little of the \"indie/chic\" factor (not that it gave off the impression of trying to be indie in the first place), it was definitely a nice simple spot for a relaxing weekend breakfast, with yummy food and good service to boot! Will definitely be back.",

I blame the fact that it is tucked beside the giant Sushi Tei near the circular bus stop, and it's on the second floor. If not for reading about it on food blogs I would never have gone to try it!I am so glad I did. The first time round I tried their big breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed myself. The place, even though small, has quite a good ambience with wooden chairs and tables and even a shelf for books. It is rather Ikea-style. The second time I went was to try their pastas. They make their own! Their green tea pasta was so good. It was al dente and very flavorful. I also had it with my favorite cider, the Elderflower and Lime. All in all this is a super great place for brunch and pastas. Their burgers are alright. Go for what I recommended instead!",

It's a small place that does fusion food, but I've only tried the brunch and coffee here. Walking up into the quaint and intimate dining on the 2nd floor was nice. The glass windows meant you had a view of Serangoon Gardens.I ordered the big breakfast and it was... a big breakfast. The bacon was very crispy but a little too salty, and my poached eggs were poached to perfection. The sausages were nothing special, so all in all, I do not feel that it is great value for money. It is definitely a hearty breakfast or brunch for the late-riser or hungover soul, but I'm not impressed enough to keep coming back. Service here was fast and efficient, though the staff were not very friendly. Being a coffee snob, the watery, milky coffee served here was definitely not a great latte, but neither was it horrible. A mediocre experience in my books. Perhaps I will come back to try the other dishes, but I seem to have lost the motivation from this first experience.",

The acoustics in this place is not the best as well, so a packed crowd really is a little too much for the ears to bear. It was not my notion of a restful weekend brunch. The breakfast platter that my sister had was pretty decent looking and tasting, but my lobster mac-and-cheese was waaaaayyy too creamy for me to eat more than four bites. i think this place has potential and it is probably a much more pleasant place to eat at during dinnertime, but I will not be returning for brunch anytime soon.",

Would \u00a0prefer to self help to make things quicker for myself which I did to get an extra packet of sugar as I knew where they were placed.
