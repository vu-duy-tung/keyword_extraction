    "text": "Classic chain seafood restaurant, now more accessible since it is near the city. Thus you see lots of business dining tables.Long Beach claims that they invented the black pepper crab. It's an overall crowd pleaser. The rest of the classic seafood dishes are all available: deep fried baby squids (it was a tad too sweet the night we ate), steamed bamboo clams with garlic and vermicelli, fried mee goreng (nice and spicy). And if you are there with overseas guests, they can also try lots of local desserts like durian pudding. All set in a floating bowl of dry ice for added effect. Cheap thrill, I know, but it's tacky local!Plus, free parking at dempsey!Tip: If you prefer black pepper crab to chilli crab, but like the chilli crab gravy.....For S$6, you can get a bowl of chilli crab gravy (without the crab, but the full works with runny egg, etc) that you dip with mantou. Best of both crab-worlds.",

Not quite as spicy here so if you don't like spicy then this could be a good place for you. Service was good in the beginning but it took 15 minutes to get my check. In their defense, it was very very busy by the time I was ready to leave so they were hustling to keep up with the large groups. Staff was very friendly and helpful.",

As mentioned before this place charges you for everything; the peanuts; the hand towels; but not the bathroom remarkably. The food is good, but charging for every little thing coupled with the spotty English gives this place two stars.",

We were told no because it was not a house specialty and we're talked into a butter type sauce. We also ordered some shrimp and some greens. The crab came out smothered in sauce that made it very messy to eat. That would not have been bad but the crab was so overcooked you had to scrape the meat out of the shell and it was mushy. We told the manager that we were not satisfied so THEN he offered to replace with a steamed crab. By that time we had been there an hour and no longer wanted to sit there. After some meager compensation we still left with a $354 check, an uneaten crab, and very disappointed. I will never go back and would never recommend this place to anyone. Go to Jumbos!",

Pretty standard Chinese seafood fare here. The thick chilli crab gravy is fantastically fragrant and a perfect dip for a deep fried mantou. Another dish I really like is the drunken prawns. The preparation of the dish is a tad disturbing though - they dump the live prawns into the broth in front of you and you may have to watch it shiver and jump in the throes of death. Not for the faint-hearted. Another famous dish here is the black pepper crab but it is a little too sweet for my liking.One thing that I have grown to appreciate about Long Beach is that it is such a typical Chinese restaurant - impatient and boisterous waitresses, a dish of peanuts of a complimentary appetizer and dubious looking chinese tea that tastes pretty much just like hot water.",

I've been here since young and the standards have always remained consistent. Bookings are essential if you want to sit indoors where there's air-conditioning, if not, you'll find the al fresco areas rather breezy as well. It's not just their crabs that are awesome, they also have other delicious items on the menu like bamboo clams, fried duck, hor fun with a very good 'wok hei', mee goreng and the Alaskan white pepper crab. Their desserts are rather good as well, do be sure to try their durian pudding. Its one of the best they have, but unfortunately, it depends on your luck as they don't have it all the time!",

The butter crab was absolutely delectable, with soft, sweet, buttery, finger-licking, lip-smacking, rich gooey goodness everywhere. The razor clams are much bigger than I've gotten elsewhere on the island, and were absolutely worth the premium price. Very fresh, sweet, tender, yet with a good amount of chew, and a great garlicky sauce. The sea bass in thai sauce was average but not bad. Otak was pretty good, tofu with house special sauce not a big standout but still popular with the table. All in all, a good meal!",

The chili crab came with some fried buns, which complemented the chili crab nicely. They added some texture and also helped cool us down when the chili got too spicy for us (it rarely did, though; the chili in chili crab really hasn't seemed that spicy so far). I LOVED the chili because it was so rich and creamy, while my friend loved the taste of the black pepper. We ended up devouring the crabs quickly, thoroughly enjoying this meal.We highly suggest this place if you're in town and looking for some chili or black pepper crab!",

Chilli carb -40 mins to cook. The chilli one was on a sweet side with thick gravy. All 4 sets of crab legs were missing-(. Pepper crab came 10 mins after order, was perfectly seasoned, only one set of legs was present.The crabs supposedly have to be 1 kg and above. Both of ours were under 1 kg -(.Each crab -58 dollars, they charge 0.30 for every wet napkin you use!!! and 2 dollars for peanuts (offered as you sit down).Probably will check another place when we crave for crabs",

    "text": "Brought 2 friends visiting from the states and shared the $168 set menu which included quite a few dishes. More than enough food for 4 people. We started with a live prawn dish with broccoli that was quite good, and also some chicken wings (who doesn't love deep fried chicken wings, mmm).The black pepper crab came out next and the table went silent with everyone enjoying the deliciousness. We added a chili crab to our order so that we can get a taste of both and we all liked the black pepper crab better. The veggie dish and noodles were quite good also, rounded out with a dessert (some kind of warm taro paste, yum).As newbies all dining here for the first time, we didn't know we could ask for bibs, gloves, and scissors for the crab! When we saw the tables next to us with these awesome amenities, we were very sad as we just didn't know to ask.The weird thing about this restaurant is they have pictures of scantily clad women on the napkin covers and menus which makes the place seem very cheap and sleazy... I thought that was quite weird. Also weird are the beer girls. When you order beer, they pour for you. These girls wear Tiger outfits which consists of a very short one piece miniskirt dress thingy. Again, makes the place feel cheap and weird and not a respectable restaurant. I don't get it.Still, the food was all around good enough to get 4 stars and not 3.",

    "text": "Not the best. We tried a bunch of dishes. Listing them out and explaining why. 1. Fried Shrimp with some type of lightly fried fish topping - was okay. The shrimp just didn't have enough flavor. I don't like overly flavored food so for me to want extra flavor means this wasn't done right. 2. Tofu with lightly fried fish toppings - this dish was okay. Good balance between the sauce and the tofu was firm but soft at the same time. 3. Duck - skip this dish. It's dry and bland. Had to drown it in the sweet sauce to give it some flavor.4. Steamed fish - don't remember the type of fish but it was okay. The fish was cooked well and flavored were a good mix. 5. Fried fish - a little on the dry side but it was tasty. 6. White pepper and black crab - the white pepper \u00a0ran was my favorite dish here. It was smokey but not too smokey like the black pepper crab. Most of my friends like the black pepper crab though. They liked the spicy smokiness. 7. Lo Mein noodles \u00a0with fish and squid I believe - \u00a0this dish was good. Has good balance of salty and sweet. Texture of the noodles were good. Firm but also soft. 8. The fried buns - these were so good. They're plain but good at holding the flavors of whatever dish you liked the most by dipping them into their sauce. Would definitely order these. 9. Chili Crab - no bueno. Would not order. The sauce was too sweet and tangy in a bad way. Tasted as though they removed it from a can and heated it up in the microwave...shame. That's the reason we went to this place. 10. Fried rice with little bits of fish - you can't see the fish but you can taste it. This dish was good as well. Would definitely order. 11. Another fried rice dish with chunks of fish, onions, scallions and egg - would skip this dish. Not good. The combination of the ingredients and sauce did not work. 12. The garlic clams - too much garlic and clams were chewy. Not the best. Would skip. 13. Bok choi and mushroom soup - gooey texture of the soup threw me off. Was not a fan.Overall, would probably not go back unless I had to for some strange reason. Also, not the friendliest staff either.",

Just the Chilli crab and its friends to go along with. So first we ordered the razor clams as our appetizer, it was so yummy. It had glass noodles with finely diced garlic ontop. The garlic was quite a lot (which I like), accompanied with the yummy sauce. Everything was just so mouth-watering. After that came along the.. Chilli crab ta-daaa!!! It was so darn good- the sauce is only a little spicy for me because I take spice pretty good.. So so savory. We eat that with the steamed buns. When the crab meat is all gone, we tend to just keep eating by dipping the buns in the chilli crab sauce. Deffinitely will keep paying a visit hehe but I need to refrain myself for going every darn weekend since the chilli crab is such a high caloric food haha.",

    "text": "Crabs are what you come for here so get those if you get nothing else. There're several Long Beach outlets all over Singapore but we ended up here since it's located in the trendy Dempsey area. Reservations are highly recommended since they're often packed for dinner seems like practically every day. More so on the weekends. We took the chance without reservations since we were there early and it was just the 2 of us. They did have a table but also told us we might have to finish our dinner within an hour or so. So what happens if we didn't? Didn't get to find out.Despite that initial hitch, service was friendly and nice. They offered to take our photos without asking (yes, I was being a tourist) and the food arrived soon after we ordered. One medium sized crab cooked in pepper sauce and another in chilli sauce came along with fried rice (can't recall the name but it has bits of Otah in it)- Pepper crab: stir fried with finely ground black pepper sauce that gets into every nook and cranny of the crab. Good complex flavor with garlic and mild heat from the pepper. - Chilli crab: This is the highlight for me as the crab is swimming in the chilli sauce. Lacks the complexity of the pepper version but the eggy and mildly spicy sauce hits the spot. Drizzle this on rice or dip the fried bread rolls in the sauce, either way, I could live on this stuff. Great food and above average service but expect to pay for it. Total tab for the 2 crabs, fried rice came to just over S$100. Pretty pricey in my book but then again, Singapore ain't cheap.",

The branch on East Coast is probably slightly better in terms of freshness, but this one is much more convenient. Plus you can have a drink in one of the bars & pubs at Dempsey afterwards. You have to order the fried mantou to go with the chili sauce. Soak it all up! A friend took the remaining sauce home and made a nice pasta the next day. \u00a0 In addition to the crab, I'd also recommend the crispy duck and the Thai-style steamed fish. The duck especially is one of the best I've had anywhere. Crispy, chewy, meaty, and packed with flavor. I can gnaw on its bones! Service and ambience are so-so, and it's on the expensive side. But still the best chili crab in Singapore in my opinion.",

We got chili crab, fried mantou, and tofu. We got to cracking the crab and sure enough it landed on my white top and my legs! Then, that's when they us bibs! Too late for that.The food is good.

    "text": "It's all about fingering the crabs baby!You cannot say you've been to Singapore if you have not tried their amazing seafood. More specifically the iconic Singapore chili crab.A perfectly steamed from live mud crab (Samoan crab to Hawaii Yeeps) claws the size of your hand. \u00a0Shell cracked then basted in a fresh chili sauce, fragrant herbs, a touch of sugar, and thickened by eggs. \u00a0Messy to eat (wear your bib or be prepared to toss your shirt) but so tasty. The warming but not thermonuclear chili flavor, draws out the natural sweetness of the crab. The meat itself, very firm in texture, closer to lobster that crab. \u00a0A side of montou (deep fried sweet buns) the perfect accompaniment to mop up the delicious sauce. Heck, they even provide a bowl and spoon so you do not let any of the delicious sauce go to waste, it's filled with the female crab eggs after all..Do not pass on the black pepper crab. \u00a0Invented by Long Beach Seafood, outstanding. \u00a0The same mud crab, perfectly steamed, shells cracked, but this time saut\u00e9ed in very finely ground, copious quantities of black pepper. \u00a0The dry roasted pepper corns, very spicy, aromatic, with no bitter or acrid flavors. It works even better at bringing out the sweetness of the \u00a0crab. \u00a0Outstanding.Add a few additional fresh seafood dishes to round out the meal. The razor clam, ordered by the piece, steamed in a gentle soy garlic sauce and topped with vermicelli and crispy garlic is exceptional. The clams, well cleaned and perfectly cooked display and oceanic sweetness and texture of an abalone more than a clam.Crunchy deep-fried prawns cooked from live with freshly fried garlic also amazing. The restaurant knows how to tease the sweetness out of the best seafood. \u00a0This prawn dish can be ordered with or without the shell.Note: crab dishes can be done with the traditional mud crab, Australian Crystal crab, or Alaskan King crab though why mess with tradition. Market price by the kilo. 1 kg minimum.What to drink? Tiger beer of course.Service is extremely efficient but always with a smile. \u00a0It is surprising that there are no accidents in the hectic dining room with servers rushing between tables.Advance booking required at all locations. Use the website. \u00a0Indoor and outdoor seating. \u00a0Despite the heat, dine outdoors so the food doesn't cool too quickly.Although the food sounds humble, seafood is rarely inexpensive. This dinner for two inclusive of four beers, tax, and service exceeded $250 SGD. it was worth every penny.I truly cannot wait to get back to fingering one of my favorite crabs of all time",

    "text": "This is my favorite place in Singapore to get chilli crab - mainly because they make each batch fresh and from scratch, and the sauce is always rich, satisfying and with a nice balance between sweet, spicy, sour and savory. If you're lucky, they'll have enormous crabs available which are the absolute best!!! They cost a pretty penny but it's so worth it when you can dunk that giant claw in all the delicious chilli crab sauce. The sauce is so good, I eat it with everything - the crab, additional prawns that I order on the side, mantou (steamed or fried buns, I prefer steamed), mee goreng. If there's a lot leftover, I even take it home to toss with pasta the next day.They do good seafood overall - I've had good experiences with their steamed clams (bamboo clams or pacific clams), prawns (the drunken or steamed ones are my favorite), baby squid (fried in a sweet black sauce that I love), geoduck (expensive but yummy). They also have some good vegetable sides and I really like the mee goreng. Especially when you can eat the mee goreng with the remaining chilli crab sauce. Yum.Because I don't eat crabs in any other style, I consistently come back just for the chilli crabs which are truly the best thing available here. I've had chilli crab in many other restaurants and none of them come close to what Long Beach offers at Dempsey. I've found that their standards can be a little inconsistent in other outlets but Dempsey has always been consistently delicious! Service is great too - you can get plastic gloves and bibs to protect your clothes and hands when handling all that seafood. It just makes the entire experience more pleasant (and it's also great when you don't go home with chilli crab sauce all over your top).",

    "text": "Diners Beware! \u00a0Went last night to have a highly anticipated chili crab dinner based on yelp reviews and was so disappointed. The chili crab was good but the other dishes on the value set menu were dudes. \u00a0Especially the seasonal greens with dried scallop and crab - I couldn't find any crab in the dish just egg white cooked to resemble crab and a few strands of dried scallop swimming in a cornstarch gloop. \u00a0The pan-fried noodle \"la la King\" was just as deceptive - about six tiny baby clam shells which only had 3 filled with clams again drowning in a heavy corn-starched sauce. \u00a0Consistency must be the restaurant's strong suit because the coconut jelly dessert was almost inedible, Non-descript gelatin covered in coconut milk sprinkled with a few tapioca balls. \u00a0The evening started out bad when the waiter brought black pepper crab to my table after I ordered the chili crab. \u00a0Basically he pleaded that he would have to pay for the mix up in dishes but after I insisted that I wanted the chili crab did he take back the black pepper. \u00a0Not an enjoyable or relaxing meal when you feel you have to defend your menu selection and stand up for your rights, only to realize that this is a tourist trap orchestrated from the beginning to maximize your check - from the strategic placing of the non-complimentary appetizer and wet wipes on your table. \u00a0I had to ask for napkins since they didn't have any on the table, another ploy to buy the wet wipes. \u00a0Save your round trip taxi fare and $200 SGD (value menu plus 2 small mantou, a Tiger beer, and bottled water). \u00a0I was still yearning for good Singaporean seafood after this horrible dining experience.",

    "text": "MUST GO! Your life isn't complete without going to Long Beach Seafood when you're in Singapore.My husband and I were skeptical about going out of the way for this restaurant. We were staying at the Mandarin Oriental in Marina Bay. Getting to Dempsey Hill was a hassle and there are so many other good food options closer to us. Still a local coworker insisted that we try Long Beach Seafood... And thus the journey to great food began...Public transit was a hassle. We took the green line on the MRT (train) to Commonwealth then took the 105 bus to Opp Pierce. From there, we walked across a pedestrian bridge, across a lawn, up a hill, thru a construction zone, passed several parking areas and VOILA! We finally arrived. Somehow we ended up in the back of the restaurant? The really nice wait staff ushered us to the front. *whew*Instead of testing our luck at picking random things on the menu, we went with a pre-selected dinner menu. The meal for 2 people cost $148 SGD (which was about $110 USD). Razor clams hadn't been delivered as a result of bad weather... So instead, they gave us some other clams as substitutes but prepared the same way as the razor clams. These were the best clams I've ever had. The clams were stuffed with garlic glass noodles and clam meat. There was also a light soy sauce that complimented the dish. The savory dish was light, flavorful, and left you wishing for more!Up next was the leek flower blossom. I never had this before but it was so very delicious! The leek flower blossom was cooked but still had a nice crunch. Again, it was a very light dish even though it appeared to be stir-fried or saut\u00e9ed. The main dish was the black pepper crab. This was a life changing experience! The black pepper sauce was thick, flavorful, and spicy! It complimented the huge chucks of crab meat we dig out of the claws. Not only did was this finger licking good, I almost kicked my plate clean!!! I seriously had to go wash my hands and face after this yummy dish.We also had the flat rice noodles with \"la la King\" sauce, which was a thick gravy sauce with clams and topped with crispy friend wontons. The flavor of this dish was very subtle and elegant.Lastly, we had an amazing dessert of pudding with ice cream and a mango sauce. No words could possibly describe light and yummy this dish was. You'll just have to go try it for yourself!The wait staff was so very kind and attentive. We never had to ask for anything bc they were always a step ahead of us. Our waiter even called a taxi for us to get back to our hotel.The restaurant was also very clean. The food/restaurant standards in Singapore should be commended.",

Well, I can believe that is the case as I continued to fight through the sweat pouring out them pores so that my tongue could continue it tonguegasmic tour of the seafood that is provided here.Yet, thing is...that was all that was the splendor this place had to provide. Freaking crabs.Everything else on the menu (with the exception of the fried chicken - which isn't even seafood) was bland and boring at best. I wanted to say I hated everything else BUT let's be honest, the aunt was showing much love to us...and wanted to bring us the \"best\" as a show of love and welcome.She definitely was a WIN.This restaurant, however, was bordering on a FAIL.Eat pepper crab...and tell the rest of the seafood choices to get a life.Yelp 100: 28/100",
