The meat is really good, if you compare to those buffet style hot pot at Liang Seah Street and if you are willing to splurge!! I think this place should place $$$$ sign on it. I especially like the handmade cuttlefish noodle here and it comes in a wrapped plastic bag for you to squeeze it out like a long woolly worm! ;)The pork bone soup that we have selected has a thick aroma and it comes with a chunky pork bone as well. I think the soap tastes so much better than those at Liang Seah Street but again the hefty price tag that comes with it may deter you from visiting more frequently than the rainy days pouring in Sg. Next time it rains, maybe you will think of the hot pot here and it opens til 3 am :)",

    "text": "I hardly have steamboat in restaurants as it is usually a home affair. The only steamboat place which I went quite often is COCA and it was only because of the chili dip. So I am quite at a loss here as it is a la carte style, and the cost will all add up, making it a very pricey meal. You do get what you pay for as the ingredients were fresh and the soup was premium. The place itself was comfortable and nice, with proper serving chopsticks (for each diner) as well as a common pair of serving chopsticks and soup ladle. That was a very thoughtful touch. What we had:- USA pork (thinly sliced)- USA marbled beef- meatballs- tang o- Tianjin cabbage- assorted mushrooms- geoduck- squid- drunken chicken soup base (10 types of soup base available)I loved the condiments and sauces (12 types to choose from). The server mixed it for us and it was very tasty. The soup was delicious with am initial \u00a0strong wine taste which kinda tapered off after the meat and veggies were cooked in it. The soup became thicker and richer at the end of the meal. Service was good, with the server coming over to top up the soup, check the temperature and remove any empty baskets/plates.The tianjin cabbage was to die for - the sweetest I have ever eaten. The fleshy white base was very soft and sweet. If you dislike vegetables, this could change your mind. The meatballs looked handmade but I did not think much of them. They were alright to me. The other highlight was the meat. The thinly sliced pork (like the Japanese shabu shabu pork) had not porky taste/smell and was very good. Likewise for the marbled beef. That was very tender and could just melt in your mouth too. The mushrooms and veggies were quite usual. Fresh, which was good. The squid and geoduck were probably good but as I was not a big fan of both, I did not have much. Oh and a quarter chicken was actually included in the drunken chicken soup base. So we had 3 types of meat in the end. You could do 2 types of soup but at an additional cost, so we did not bother with it.Oh and it opens till 3am, so it is an option for late night supper.I am not sure if I will come back often. I like the food and the quality but the pricing is a bit prohibitive. The average is probably $50 - $80 per person, depending on what you have. The cheapest set is $88++ for 2.",

My favourites include:- assorted squid/ pork/ prawn balls- frozen tofu (interesting texture)- fish-paste noodles- sliced beefIf you feel generous, be sure to order the geo-duck. SO FRESH and goes really well (sashimi-style or dip it in the hotpot for a few seconds) with soysauce and wasabi.Great place for family gatherings or special occasions !",

    "text": "This is a review of a Chinese New Year's Eve dinner date at Imperial Treasure Steamboat Restaurant.tinyurl.com/al53pz9This was a set menu. There were no other options.The ambiance is pretty no frills. \u00a0It is traditional. \u00a0It is conservative, basic and functional.The staff is professional and, in the beginning, helpful. \u00a0I would not say they are overly friendly though. \u00a0Also, after bringing all of the food, they really didn't check often to see if we needed anything or assistance.I never really know how to go about reviewing steamboat. \u00a0 I am going to keep this pretty basic.We started with Yu Sheng. \u00a0I admit it. \u00a0We were relatively reserved in our tossing. \u00a0 But we did get it properly mixed. The ingredients (including the salmon) were all very fresh. \u00a0Unlike the Yu Sheng I had at work, I actually ate some of this. \u00a0There was a nice mix of different flavours and textures. \u00a0Even though I did not eat that much, I thought it was quite refreshing. \u00a0The salmon was very good.tinyurl.com/b2y6qgttinyurl.com/av8hmfkAs for the steamboat itself, we had the standard soups with one side mild and one side spicy. \u00a0 Even though it makes me cry, cough, and turns my face red, I prefer the spicy soup. \u00a0It also provides my dinner date with an opportunity to make fun of me.I am listing the key items below. \u00a0I will mark my favourites with a (*).*DumplingsFish BallsGreensBean SproutsDried Fish SkinAbalone*Cuttlefish*Crab*BeefTofuI think that covers most of it. \u00a0The ingredients were all fresh and of high quality. \u00a0i did think they were a little light on the beef. \u00a0This was very good hot pot.Soup:tinyurl.com/cmgyk5fThe basics:tinyurl.com/d6lqrytAbalone & Cuttlefish:tinyurl.com/bwhfcqaCrab:tinyurl.com/c7ap7q4Beef:tinyurl.com/crmayulReceipt (Dinner for Two - $419.01):tinyurl.com/brhzlo5Overall - This was a high quality steamboat experience with a little CNY festivity thrown in. \u00a0The service is reasonable. \u00a0The space is functional. \u00a0At over $400 for two people, I felt it was expensive. \u00a0That is quite a bit for a hot pot dinner. \u00a0It is certainly, and by far, the most expensive hot pot I've ever enjoyed. \u00a0 It was CNY Eve though.",

It is al carte orders so the prices can add up. BTW, they do charge for the sauce and condiments. So hehe.. better not be just using soya sauce as the dipping sauce. lol.  In all honesty, I love steamboat but for the amount we paid for the dinner, I would have rather patronized their sister restaurant Imperial Treasure Super Peking duck. \u00a0If you are looking for late night dining, this restaurant is open till 3am daily.",

    "text": "Probably the most posh steamboat I have ever had in my life, with a bill to show for it.This is not your $10-all-you-can-eat steamboat place. To be safe, just add another zero to that number per person. Depends on what you order, of course, but I think $50/person is the least you could get away with.It's all worth it. The soup bases are very good. The quality of all the ingredients is very high. You do get what you pay for.The massive number of sauces and condiments is a plus too, they're all tasty. \u00a0I adore the fermented bean sauce whenever I can get my hands on some. Mix and match and make up your own sauce to go with the food. A note: check with the waitstaff on the price of the sauces. I don't remember what it costs, but I do remember quite a number of other people complaining about this at various times.You'll be stuffed.I don't think I can eat such a high class steamboat all the time, but it's nice to have such a fancy, well-deserved option.",
