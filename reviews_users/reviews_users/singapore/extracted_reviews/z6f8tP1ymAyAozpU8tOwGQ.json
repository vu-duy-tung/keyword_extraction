    "text": "It was cold by Singapore standards (Under 30? No lah...) and the only prescription was authentic Nasi Padang. Let's be honest, this meal is never pretty, and Rendezvous was no different. After selecting your dishes from the chef's counter, you head over to a dated cafeteria style seating area overlooking Clarke Quay. When your dishes come out, bright yellows, deep browns and milky reds sit - barely identifiable chicken, fish and veggies bobbing and gasping for their last breath - before you smoother your rice with them, but day-um it's good. The sambal brinjal, korma chicken and chicken rendang were my personal favourites, and there was something that involved potatoes that I still dream of. So delicious. Overall, I felt the veggie dishes had more complex, rich flavours than the meat dishes, so in the future I'd probably just opt for a full on veggie smorgasbord. But it seems no matter what you choose, your eyes will always be bigger than your stomach, so prepare to come here and eat. (And to spend some cash to do so!)",

Prefer the chicken to the beef. The rice is also very fragrant. Not sure if it is coconut rice or not.Nice old school ambience that overlooks the Singapore river at Clarke Quay.Price point is a little high though.",

    "text": "I love this place. Ok so the food is a little pricey but totally worth it seriously!The decor is pretty old school with chairs and tables that kinda remind you of the nicer restaurants in the old days. Very retro but everything looks sparkling clean. If you manage to get a window seat, you'll get an awesome view of Boat Quay and the Singapore River. This just means that you can take your time to enjoy the view and savour the food, which I highly recommend you do because its just absolutely delicious.So you pick out the individual dishes you want from the menu. Le bf and I had two curries, sambal eggs, some veggies and a few other dishes. They'll give you white rice of course to eat with your food. So totally worth the money spent. In fact, I'm already getting hungry just typing this out. I haven't tried all their dishes on the menu but this place is already at the top of my places to revisit list. Unfortunately I ate too much to leave any room for dessert but I heard their chendol and other local desserts are pretty awesome too. If you don't mind the price and really want some good nasi padang, check this place out at least once. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "This place is very nostalgic for me as I used to have eat here regularly in the 90s with my family. I must have stopped coming here for about 10 years, but the taste of the green/yellow curry has never left my memory!Located in a corner of the Central, Rendevous Restaurant actually takes up quite a lot of space as it is segmented into three parts. The ordering is a bit unconventional compared to the usual restaurants - you walk through the food counter and point at what you want, and the waiters will bring it over to your table. The food's pricy for nasi padang though - I ordered chicken curry, two begedil, curry veg, two plates of rice and three glasses of ice lemon tea and the bill came up to $30. The food was okay - you can find better nasi padang at hawker centres. Definitely try their chendol, I had it here the last time and it was delicious!I'll still be back though. I love the ambience and the set up of the place!",

    "text": "I'm abit torn on this one. Its great nasi padang obviously but I cant wrap my head around paying that amount of money for something I can get at a coffeeshop or hawker centre. I used to to the old outlet at rendezvous hotel when I was much younger and I really enjoyed the food there. The food at the new outlet is possibly just as good. The curry chicken thigh , beef rendang and sambal kangkong were some of my favourites.But at the end of it, I kept wondering if I would pay 8 bucks for a chicken thigh and $3.60 for sambal kang kong the next time I wanted nasi padang. Based on quality of food, I'd give it 4 stars but I've yet to be convinced it worth paying so much.",

    "text": "Randomly stumbled upon this place one night at Central Mall, while searching for a ramen shop which proved to have a queue that was too long for our hungry stomachs. Rendezvous Restaurant though more than made up for our disappointment! The awesome smell wafting from the restaurant made our mouths water; and the food was purely satisfying. The potato patties and beef rendang are to die for. The former is crispy on the outside and has a wonderfully tender interior. Pour some of the beef rending gravy over it, and you have a taste bomb. Yum. Price wise, Rendezvous Restaurant is cheap too - a meal for 2 cost $26 (okay fine, it's not exactly the cheapest price to pay for nasi padang, but considering the location, you can't really complain). Definitely worth checking this restaurant out if you're ever at Central Mall.",

    "text": "A Malay padang restaurant, Rendezvous provides an almost smorgasboard style of ordering your food. Choose your meat and choose your curry accompaniment - rendang, sambal etc They will chop up your protein for you and then add on the sauce. Clean but what I consider a bit sterile surroundings (although supposed to be like an old school cafe), make sure you reserve a table ahead so you can get a view of the river. My personal favourites were the sambal egg, the beef rendang and the bergadel (sp.?). I also advise coming as a group so you can order a wide variety of dishes to share. My first ice kachang experience too, which was a refreshing and surprisingly delicious treat! Definitely worth a visit for some delicious Malay food, however given I was with locals this time and did all the ordering so it might be a bit more of a lucky dip when I visit again!",
