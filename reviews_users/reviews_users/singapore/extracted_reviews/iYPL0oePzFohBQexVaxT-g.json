It does not have the 17% hidden charges for tax and tips, does not charge you the 17% and demand that you queue up to order, does not charge you for tap water. That's worth 3 stars in my books in Singapore where most eateries are just dodgy that way.",

That said, I do appreciate good pizza occasionally, and Peperoni Pizzeria definitely makes the cut.The family pizza is is very big and I think can easily feed 6-8 people (instead of 4-6 as written on the menu). I typically order a half and half, so you get to have two types of pizza for 1 order. Frutti di Mare (seafood), Pancetta, Prosciutto Crudo di Parma are some of my common orders and they are all excellent choices. The pizza crust is slightly thinner, and has the crisp from the wood oven. Mmm. The pasta here is also pretty decent. I've only tried the Aglio Olio, Pesto, and Alle Vongole - all were pretty decent. I think the secret is the fresh ingredients!If you're not stuffed by the end of dinner, definitely give the tiramisu dessert a try!",

Much prefer the Parma ham pizzaSoup of the day was potato leek soup. I LOVED THIS. Don't be deceived by the murky brown appearance. Looks apart, this was the bomb. Hit the spot on so many levels. Penne Carbonara - one of the better carbonaras around. Taste was rich, and not just full of cream. Would order as a shared dish as its too 'gelak' for one pax to finishAngel hair aglio olio - definitely decent, would re-order a lot of garlic chips. But smth lacking to make this amazingSpaghetti squid ink - should have ordered this with linguine instead, spaghetti was slightly too thin to grip sauce properly.

    "text": "My dad told me of this place as we planned for our usual Sunday family dinner. We're not exactly big pizza lovers, but we decided to try something a little different this time round. We were first greeter by a new wait staff who obviously wasn't well versed in service etiquette - which really started the dinner experience on a pretty bad note. To make things worse, our order never made it to the kitchen till a senior staff (who gave really good service in comparison) happened to take note. Our order, the largest pizza (cant remember the exact dimensions but I reckon it's somewhere around 21 inches) which was a salmone/ funghi mix came only an hour later, although garlic bread was given to us on the house because of the delay. ... but what a pizza it was. Size aside (which i'm pretty sure other yelpers would have given sufficient emphasis by now), the pizza tasted absolutely fabulous. The pizza was made from the traditional wood oven, which scored bonus points from me, and the mushrooms and salmon strips were all very fresh. My only complaint was that the pizza size was really too big, even for the 5 of us - but then again, that's a healthy problem if any :)Will definitely be coming back here again. Apparently their non-pizza dishes are pretty good too!",

I particularly love that their pizza is so thin yet flavourful and the amount of ingredients that they give is plentiful as well.I like their flexibility of being able to combine 2 different flavours onto one pizza, which means you do not have to order 2 different pizzas in order to satisfy your cravings. Their service is also good and the restaurant is quite quiet a nice place to have a cosy meal with loved ones.Though the place is located at quite an inconvenient place, it is a definite must try for pizza lovers and guaranteed to make you come back for more.",

Glad that we didnt. It was really really huge when i look at the table beside us.We ordered Bolognese to share. In my opinion, i actually prefer their pasta than their pizza.

    "text": "My review is for Pep's home delivery service from the Binjai outlet. Since I'm too lazy to create a new listing for Binjai, let's just use some imagination here.I've eaten at Pep many times but tried their delivery service for the first time on Saturday night for dinner at 10pm. I was hungry, it was late and I didn't feel like driving out. I don't eat fast food so the next best thing I could think was Pep.The website interface is fairly intuitive. You have to register to order and they quote a delivery time estimate (1 hour). I didn't quite get why they were offering a disincentive for orders on weekends ($4 surcharge), but I ended up getting that netted off by ordering after 9.30pm (-$4) and doing so online (-10% of order). The food arrived about 30-40 mins after I placed the order and it was packed into these chic little black boxes. They were super generous with the chili flakes and Parmesan I requested and even provided cutlery packs. The half-Saucison half- egg/prosciutto pizza was delicious, though not as piping hot as I would have liked. The seafood marinara capellini was spot. on. and the first to get wolfed down by the dude and I. Garden salad as always was sparse on toppings and for the first time, the salad leaves were kind of...dry. We added water (you get desperate at 10pm), dressing and a half a red pepper to increase the nutrition load. Overall a pretty fuss-free experience and I was a happy dapper.",

I am really glad that we found this excellent place to satisfy our pasta-pizza craving!We ordered Calamari Frittior our appetizer and it was really good! Buttery crisp of the calamari ring, deep fried till golden brown yet it was not overly oily.Frutti Di Mare - seafood pizza which consist of Prawns, clams, scallops, squid rings, fish & garlic. One of the best seafood pizzas I have ever eaten and their pizza are thin crusted. They are generous with the seafood and they give customers the option to add extra toppings and meat (prama ham, seafood, prawn, pancetta) for a small price.Suprema - Shitake, chicken sausage, onions & red chili. This is one of the Chef's recommendations. One mouthful of it and you will get the spicy kick as there's a dose of of red chili-padi added. We enjoyed this pizzaAlle Vongole - Venus clams in white wine sauce. One of the best Alle Vongole and it is also one of the Chef's recommendations. Juicy and succulent clams soaked in savoury white wine sauce, small slices of crispy fried garlic, tomatoes contributing to the wonderful flavour - heavenly! They are generous with the clams and you got to try it!Tiramisu - The tiramisu tastes wonderful and fluffy, and is not overly-heavy. Mocca-flavoured whipped cream with aromatic espresso flavour and a hint of liquor , super sinful and yummy!Overall, Peperoni Pizzeria serves Delicious wood fired pizza and its Great for couples and families alike! The price is slightly on on the high side but like I said, every single dish was good or fantastic.For full reviews and photos, you can view at eatandtravelwithus.com/2\u2026",

But both joints have pizza with the pizzazz!Peperoni Pizzeria's claim to fame is their XXL (21-inch!) pizza, and their versatility. If you want two kinds of toppings and can't decide on one - you don't have to! You can have both of them on one pizza. Isn't that neat?The pizza crust is thin, the toppings are fresh, the selection is vast, and put to the taste test, the Pancetta (Cured bacon, sliced tomatoes & egg) is delectable. The egg, still runny, goes perfect with the bursting-with-juice and huge slices of tomato, and the pork isn't like the typical American breakfast variety - still salty, not crispy, and tender. The selection of beers (Belgian!) is impressive as well - you have the leffes, the Satan Gold (oh la la!) and if you catch them at happy hour, you knock $2 off the price. Isn't that neat? Still a little overpriced even at happy hour - but worth it for the money you save on the pizza.",

The pizza is fantastic, and the XXL size is a fantastic bargain if you are having a party or go with a large group. I vary my order a lot and am never disappointed. I would recommend making a reservation if you are going Thurs-Sun, though, because they do get full and a few times we have not been able to get a table when we didn't make a reservation (fair enough, they are very popular!).",
