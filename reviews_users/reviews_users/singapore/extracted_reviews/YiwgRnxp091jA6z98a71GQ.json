    "text": "Binomio is a great choice for a fun date night out, especially now that the restaurant takes reservations for the front tapas bar area. \u00a0We like to belly up to the tapas bar and order the Tapas Tasting Menu, 6 tapas for $69, which includes almost everything on the tapas menu. \u00a0Compared with many other tapas options in Singapore, Binomio offers superior cuisine and value!Among our favorite items are:1) Croquetas Binomio: if there's one thing I learned from my dad about restaurants, it's that you always order the dish with the restaurant's name in it...and this was definitely an item we have ordered again and again! \u00a0Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside (stuffed with ham, chicken and egg), served on pretty plates with garlic mayo, can't go wrong!2) Albondigas: juicy beef and pork meatballs jazzed up with fried baby squids and excellent tomato gravy; we order these almost every time3) Gambas al Ajillo: I pretty much order these are every tapas bar we go to and I love nearly every version and this is no exception...I especially enjoy dipping the bread in the garlicky oil! \u00a0Yum!4) Churros: Binomio's version is more airy than most, but no less delicious with a perfectly crispy exterior and chocolate dipping saucePARTING THOUGHT: keep an eye out for the specials of the night on the chalkboard...we didn't notice it until our third trip! \u00a0They always have something interesting up there and it's usually available as an option for the tasting!",

Before it was just first come first served.Surprised I haven't written a review about Binomio yet. I could have sworn I did.Sounds like praises have been sung by the other reviews already. Just co-signing here.Really like the Larios 12 gin & tonic they make with juniper berries. It's a steal at $14 per drink.Their 6 for $69 tapas tasting menu (or 9 for $99) is quite a great deal for the quality and amount of food you get. It also lets you explore their tapas menu. There's a surcharge for starred menu items but still worth it!Awesome place to relax over a couple of good drinks and nosh. Check it out.",

I'd recommend the fried eggplants chips and the pork belly, everything else was mildly disappointing. The gambas al ajillo were a little too soggy, the vegetables tasted a bit flat... I'm not sure, maybe it was an off night? Willing to come back, but this is no longer my go-to tapas place in town...",

    "text": "Solid Spanish food. Good ambience and service was good, food was tasty without being spectacular. For tapas we had crab empanadas, pulpo (my favourite), scallops, and finished with a squid ink paella for main. Empanada pastry was a bit too thick and doughy for my liking but crab filling was certainly tasty. A bit disappointed when the head waiter said they looked like \"curry puffs\" when describing the specials, and didn't seem to know what I was referring to when I asked if they were empanadas. Pulpo was delicious. Squid was beautifully tender. Scallops were really disappointing. For such a pricy dish I couldn't believe they sliced the scallops in half meaning we effectively only got 2 scallops. Give us 4 whole ones for $25!Paella was tasty enough though again incredibly stingy with the proteins (seafood). Overall a nice place in a nice area, but couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed when leaving.",

    "text": "very good spanish food at this well-known restaurant along craig road - it's a cosy, intimate space that's packed at night, with waiters that are just the right mix of personal and professional, and dishes that both taste good and feel authentic. the flavours were rich, but just so, without overwhelming the appetite excessively.it's more napkin-ed fine dining than small-plate tapas, with prices that tread the high side for dishes well-worth the expense.we started off with two types of croquettes, croquetas binomio and croquetas de setas, bound with creamy bechamel and full of flavor. it was pretty impressive that they had managed to fry the soft mounds to a crisp exterior; I could stuff my face with these, very easily (totally worth the exercise).papada con navajas had tender strips of razor clams served on cauliflower puree, with well-seasoned char-grilled pork belly - very good - as was the chipirones rellenos, lightly chewy squid rings served with squash chips and a meat sauce.the beauty at the table was truly the fideua negra, skinny beehoon-sized noodles cooked paelle-style in squid ink, topped with blobs of cream and squid. it wasn't the strongest tasting dish, and was much improved with lots and lots of ground pepper and salt.don't ever be shy about salting your own food! you're the one eating (and paying) for your enjoyment.we were pretty stuffed by this point - though of course we finished with churros (but of course) and tarta belada al whisky. the first was decent, but the second cake was a whopper. cassette-sized (do you young folkies even know what a cassette is?!), the cake was an excuse for a whisky vessel - so boozy that it hits you, but the sugar in the cake and icing keeps the alcohol from being too cough-y. very good - but make sure you're prepared for it.I thought the food well-portioned, and the prices fair - we were certainly full at the end of the meal, but the wine portions defy understanding. they were barely taster-portioned; very, very strange.",

Croquetas - they come in ham or mushroom. Pretty decent. Mains: 1. Char-grilled pork belly with razor clams and cauliflower puree ($28)2. Slow-cooked suckling pig Segovian style, potato puree and tender garlic shoots ($37) 3. Paella - very strong seafood base. Dessert: 1. The Torrija de chocolate blanco (MY FAVORITE!!!) It just blew me away. A complicated name but such a simple, delicate slice of heaven :) Its made up of white chocolate butter bread, strawberry soup (delicious) and vanilla ice-cream. 2. Bunuelos de chocolate Chocolate fritters with sorbet. Pretty standard. Think fried doughnut balls dipped in chocolate. The service- Overall was good. Chef Alonso personally serves the Paella and spends time chatting with the guests. He came out at the end of the meal for a longer conversation too (right about when I was devouring my Torrija de chocolate blanco). A very easy-going character. His eyes lid up when we talked about wine and Spain.",

We chose the 6 tapas tasting menu (such a steal at a mere S$69, compared to all the other swanky tapas bars in Singapore), and went with all of the waiter's recommendations. Every dish was presented so beautifully and they were delicious. My favourites - Croquetas de Champinones, Pulpo a la gallega and Huevos Binomio. We were so happy with the selection, and everything was perfect until our paella arrived. Thinking tapas wouldn't be filling enough (they were), we had ordered their Arroz Negro (squid ink paella). Not only was it too salty and unappetizing, especially compared with the tapas we just had, it cost us more than the 6 tapas tasting menu! We were all bewildered. We'll definitely be back at the tapas bar! The 6 tapas ordered was sufficient for the 3 of us, but I think I'll be greedy next time and go with the 8 tapas tasting menu. Or more.. They were just so yummy! Perhaps we'll try something else from their dining menu too! Just not the squid ink paella. Snuck in a corner of Craig Road without too much traffic, noise or people, the place was just what we needed for a chillaxing Friday night.",

We arrived around 730pm on a thursday night and the bar was jam packed, so we had a few dishes at the restaurant before scooting over to the bar. The restaurant dishes were, in my opinion, a tad tastier and fancier than the bar offerings, but does not warrant the difference in price tag. A typical bar tapas is about 6-10 bucks whereas for the restaurant, it's about 15-40, albeit the portions being slightly bigger. I like the bar because you can get many tapas without hurting your wallet. The tapas are generally tasty, made with good ingredients. The entrocote was really good, as well as the pan con tomate, the shrimps and the bone marrow. Will be back. P.S: Wine by the glass is a meagre pour, so get a bottle.",

We loved the Rioja which was reasonable at 57 a bottle for Singapore (Sorry the label escapes me, Fortunado?, but there were only two Temprillanos on the wine list at the time).Seems to be a bit of date spot for people with a bit of cash.

It was like groundhog day with my visit to Mizutani (I tried my best not to sniff or blow my nose and STILL Mizutani-san noticed I was unwell and ordered green tea for me). Ill or not, the show must go on.Binomio is designed with a tapas bar in front and an elegant dining room at the back. We made reservations and some requests earlier on and the service manager was obliging. We had the mushroom croquettes, grilled squid, crayfish and pork belly as tapas starters. We crayfish and croquettes were excellent, but the squid and pork belly \u00a0weren't particularly interesting. We then had a giant pan of squid ink paella to share and it was very well done. We would have liked to have more charred rice bits but that's just me being picky. For mains, we had a suckling pig, the fish and I had the lamb chops. The suckling pig wasn't quite as mind blowing as the ones we've had in Barcelona or Segovia, but it was still good. I also thought my lamb chops were executed well as they were juicy and charred at the bone. Overall we had an enjoyable evening, though the restaurant was quite noisy at times due to the table next to ours. I recommend skipping the sangria blanco as it was on the strong side and not fantastic. Service is very good, so you'll probably walk away full and happy.",
