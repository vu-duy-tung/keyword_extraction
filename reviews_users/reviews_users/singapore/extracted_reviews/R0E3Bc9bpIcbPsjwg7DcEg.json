The chicken chipotle was OK and so were the prawn fajitas. The jalapenos were from a can, but hey, who knows even avocadoes in Singapore? White wine was quite good. Service OK, prices on the high side for the quality offered. So come here rather for the atmosphere and the exotic touch..",

Try the chimichangas, better than the rare few I had whilst living in the States. Found out there from a Mexican that the dish was from the south, and so not so often found in Californian joints, except the rare ones. And so of the rare ones I found, the Cha Cha Cha one is still better. Lighter flour used for the deep fried taco, having the nice deep fried flavor without the heaviness of the oil. And being able to taste the marinated beef inside with the salsa and gauc on top. Asianized Mexican food. \u00a0Mmmmm.",

I have been here too many times whenever i get a craving for mexican food and their guacamole, buritos and shredded beef tacos still hits the sweet spot. Compared to most Mexican places in Asia, Cha cha cha uses corn for their tacos and i think this really makes a difference, and some dishes like their soup and beef really taste like what i have sampled in the Coyoacan market in Mexico city.This restaurant will probably be rated as a 3 star joint if it were in the states or in Mexico....but in Singapore, its still one of the best mexican places to eat. I would recommend their shredded beef as its the most authentic tasting item on the menu.",

Then I heard that a former partner of El Felipe's (Now El Patio) left and started Cha Cha Cha.Perhaps my prior experience living 30 mins from the border afforded me an amazing choice of Mexican food joints that simply couldn't compare to the standard of Mexican food in Singapore.It may be one of Singapore's oldest Mexican resturants, but it definitely isn't the best and had seen better days. Sorry, but I'm not impressed. I'm told that El Felipe's isn't much better either...",

    "text": "Came here around 9 PM on a Tuesday night and found the restaurant to be surprisingly busy. This was my first time to the Holland Village area and it seemed to be buzzing, in general, and this restaurant was no different. There are tons of restaurants to choose from in the area but I was dying for Mexican food, and this seemed like the only spot in the area. The restaurant is like most others in the little thoroughfare in that it is completely open to the street. We were seated rather quickly and handed menus. The menu contains all of the tex-mex staples I was hoping for, including nachos, burritos, fajitas, and enchiladas. I ended up ordering a chimichanga and we got the chicken nachos for a starter. We also ordered a couple of jumbo margaritas. The nachos came out first and they were pleasant enough but pretty plain. They were just tortilla chips with melted cheese, shredded chicken and a few pickled jalapenos thrown on top. Then we got our margaritas, which had a really peculiar texture. I'm used to frozen margaritas having a slushy texture but these were rather thick and smoothie-like. They were really sweet and didn't have much of a tequila kick to them, unfortunately. Our mains came out and my partner and I exchanged surprised looks. I guess I'm used to TexMex places including rice and beans with the entrees automatically, but these mains were simply the dish itself... which we didn't expect. My plate had a card deck-sized chimichanga on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce-that's it. The chimichanga was alright- definitely freshly cooked but woefully understuffed and underseasoned. There was barely any meat inside (mostly cheese and beans). It was pretty poor value for the price, honestly. With the nachos, it was enough food but after spending $100+, I would have expected a more satisfying meal. Service was pretty scant after we were seated. It took us a while to get our orders in. Though to be fair it seemed like the restaurant was definitely understaffed for how busy it was.",

I'm not really into Mexican generally, but the date suggested Mexican, and I don't -mind- it, so why not!It was pleasantly surprising. Service was pretty friendly, quite prompt, and the food was above expectations. The guacamole with corn chips was alright. It wasn't a bad guac by any means, and it was definitely a generous serving of chips, but definitely not amazing memorable wow.My main though was wow. The fluetas (not sure if i spelled that right), which is a deep fried flour wrap stuffed with your choice of meat (I chose shredded chicken) and then served topped with sour cream, more guac, and cheese. Wow. Crispy, flavourful, and surprisingly filling, I was stuck with a craving for more the day after just based on the memory of it.My date ordered the combo, which comes with a three items (I honestly forgot what the three items were... there was a taco (soft or hard, your choice), maybe a tortilla, and something else) but it was good. Generously sized, and served with refried beans. I love refried beans, and theirs tasted as beans generally do (I've never tried Mexican or Tex-mex overseas, so I can't tell if it's how they SHOULD taste...) and overall I felt it was good value considering the price.They also let us linger and talk for quite a while, we were the last to leave and they never tried to chase us off or even hinted that we should leave. I love it when a restaurant's okay with that, and after a while we realised we were the last patrons and left with guilty grins. It's a good place. Humble I think, and not amazing, but I liked the service, I liked the food, and I'd recommend it to friends without any hesitation. That's four stars in my book!",

The bowl of nachos was pretty good, but the salsa dip was average and nothing to shout about (you might want to order the nachos as mains). As for the entrees, I must commend the chef for whipping up such a potent and delicious bowl of Chilli con Carne. The jalapeno peppers packed a real punch! The soft taco was rather mild, which would appeal to those who love Mexican food but prefer a lighter touch with respect to the spices used. The portions were generous and the food was certainly of great comfort. Service was efficient. Even though we paid about $15-20 per person, we had a positive experience there and felt it was worth every dollar.",

OK, so maybe we're in Singapore so being on the opposite side of the world I need to adjust my expectations, but I'm a man of principle. The food is passable not nothing special (hence the A-OK rating). The sauces in the fajitas or burritos aren't especially tasty, the chips are \"meh\", and the guac is so-so. And it's expensive to boot (well, for Singapore I guess it's average, but I'm used to cheap Mexican food).

I don't have much experience with south american or mexican food - and tex-mex is probably the closest I've been (since this year).it was a reticence set off by a traumatic carbplosion of an experience with my first ever burrito: beans and rice and guac and not much meat enveloped in a thick shroud of a tortilla - nothing I cared for a repeat of. so - I came with low expectations, and while I'm pretty darn sure the food here isn't anything fantastic, it went down easily enough.it's a rustic cuisine - bright and fresh and pretty wholesome, even if the carbtravaganza bit of it still holds true. my timid-embrace-a-new-cuisine solution: (mostly) skip the carb, and get at the protein.the corn chips were pedestrian, though that salsa was something spicy, and hence addictive. the menu is split between enchiladas and burritos, quesadillas and tacos - and really, it's the best real-life application of permutation and combination I've seen in life: the trinity of rice, tortilla and meat combined in a ludicrous number or ways.the churros were possibly the best part of the meal. fresh-fried, still soft but with a good crust, these were topped with cinnamon sugar alongside ice-cream. I'm not sure what it says about me that I much prefer those rotating crullers you see on sale at american fairs and theme parks.places like this are the bane of a food review: they have passably good food - sufficient for a mild hey-check-this-place-out-if-you're-there recommendation, but nothing to render any enthusiasm or aggravation over; service is a little haphazardly absent, but helpful enough when you get it; and the place is done up open-air and without air-conditioning, pleasant enough for a bit of a loiter.my friend says it's \"like fast food mexican\" - and I concur. it incites just about the same level of enthusiasm those joints would - sufficiently reliable enough for a quick meal, but nothing quite enough to shout about.",

    "text": "When I first moved here from LA over 3 years ago I was starving for good mexican food. \u00a0There just wasnt much here. \u00a0Thankfully over the years more and more places have sprung up. \u00a0I think since more places have opened it really shows that this place just really isnt all that great. I mean if you want \"mexican\" food then sure. They have the usual stuff. \u00a0I just felt it tasted a little bland and never really stuck with me that much. \u00a0I never really wanted to come back here for mexican. \u00a0The service is average, the food is average and not very spicy and I just never really fell in love with it. The fact that they dont have free chips and salsa just killed it for me. \u00a0Then at least you have a reason to come here and drink. You can go next door for that so whats the point.",

    "text": "Not the best quality street food for ridiculous amount of money. Most of it is not even Mexican, usually a tex-mex, when you try to ask about a Mexican dish they stare at you with a blank face but it is a problem in Singapore in general, not just in this place. And I will probably never get used to the fact that they don't bring you chips with salsa first, or you have to pay for it.",

    "text": "This place feels like a Mexican restaurant should feel: not too fancy, open air, and in a festive area. \u00a0The frozen margarita had ample tequila, somewhat surprising for Singapore. \u00a0Finally, the service was outstandingly attentive without being overbearing; it was almost like being back in the US.On the negative side, neither my wife's chalupa nor my burrito really resembled anything you would find at a Mexican restaurant across the Pacific. \u00a0Additionally, the elapsed time from the second we finished giving our orders until the time the food ended up on our table could not have been more than five minutes. \u00a0I'm not saying the food was all premade, but it was either that or microwaved, or both. \u00a0That being said, it still tasted halfway decent.If you're searching for the best Mexican restaurant in Singapore, you won't find it here. \u00a0If you're searching for a decent spot to have a Margarita and chill, it hits the spot. \u00a0I almost gave it stars, but the location and atmosphere does really provide that laid back vibe.",
