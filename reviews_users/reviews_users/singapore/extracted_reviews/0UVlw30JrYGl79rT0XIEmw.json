    "text": "Came here on a Thursday after office hours (6.00 pm) with a childhood friend of mine. Before being seated down, the waiter asked whether we had reservation and I'm glad we managed to get ourselves seated before the dinner crowd started trickling in. Before being sat down, I could smell the truffle oil from far and the smell lasted about 10 or so minutes and it appeared again after some customers ordered truffle fries. The smell did not bother me as I am into truffle fries.We were given a menu each (interesting menu - wooden back with bands to hold the piece of paper). And yes, I noticed the icons for popular dishes and without much hesitation headed for the pulled pork grain bowl and Buckwheat Pancakes. Wanted to order the Black Apple Tea but unfortunately they ran out. We had to go over to the counter to make an order as well as paying for the items.While waiting for the food, I was absorbing the ambience in the cafe. The interior design was a combination of modern and rustic from wall decorations to furnitures. My friend and I think that it is a good hangout place for dining in during dinner (good view and more food choices).Our mains came within 15 minutes of wait. As both of us enjoy sharing, we decided to share the two mains. 1) Pulled pork grain bowl - slow cooked pulled pork, quiona, baby corns with furikake sprinkled on top, red cabbage, chargrilled zucchini, roasted butternut squash (which we thought it was pumpkin), saut\u00e9ed cherry tomatoes and mixed mushrooms. Some of the ingredients listed on the menu I was not able to differentiate hence I would not be including them in this particular review. I do not know how to give a proper review as each of the ingredients have different tastes, textures and shapes and somehow they combined greatly. In this bowl, the ingredients are separated accordingly. I tried the pulled pork first as that was what I was eyeing on when glancing at the menu. The pulled pork was soft as well as chewy and heated up at the right time. It was also moist and you could taste juiciness of it. But there were fats in it too which I had to accustom to. This dish reminds me of the brekkies I had while in Aussie. Flavorful and unique.2) Buckwheat Pancakes (Vegan option) - soft fluffy buckwheat pancake with berry fruit compote, passionfruit curd (pretty mild), cornflake crumbs, thyme infused maple syrups, flowers, and fresh slices of strawberry (probably 1 strawberry) and 3-4 blueberries. The pancake tasted more like muffins. It was more dense than I thought. But somehow the cornflakes gave a bit more crunch and somehow the dish was another unique dish with explosions of flavors. For this dish, I would encourage you to share (2-3) as it will be a little too much for you. If you think it is too dry, you could add a little maple syrup on it but avoid splashing on the pancake as the dish is pretty sweet from the berry compote and passionfruit curd. For the prices, it changes overtime. Either $0.50 to $1.00 more on the dishes or less. Overall, I am glad that I decided to come here for dinner as it has variety of dishes available. The drink list was not too fabulous. I'm not a coffee drinker so I wouldn't know whether it is good or not. But I overheard the waiter suggested that it's better to get warm coffee and ice on the side rather than iced coffee. Overall, do stop by this place during non-peak hours and preferably dinner.",

Around 45 minutes after placing our order, we were told that we have to wait another 10 minutes for our dish as a fresh batch of batter had to be prepared. Really, it takes you 45 minutes to figure this out? Something's wrong here guys. Now on to the food. The spring pancakes and fried chicken was nothing to shout about. Scrambled eggs looked (and tasted) pretty good. Pulled pork bowl was above average according to my friend who had it. Coffee was good too. Will I come back? There are some positives here and I might give it another chance on non-peak hours. And in case you were wondering, I finally got my food 58 minutes after ordering.",

    "text": "As per the previous reviews - come at non-peak period. Why? Firstly, they protect themselves by having a fine print of 'food may take up to 30 minutes' in their menu. That means you can't complain until you have waited for at least 30 minutes. Secondly, the tables are arranged packed to the brim of the restaurant. Seriously, is there a maximum capacity for this place or not? There is barely space for you to move back your chair to leave the place. There wasn't even any waiting area! You will be breathing down the neck of the person sitting closest to the door. Okay, if you made it there during non-peak hours, then you are in luck to try above average food. I tried the pulled pork grain bowl and pork collar. They were both really delicious although could improve if they served it slightly warmer. The pulled pork grain bowl is a well-balanced meal with grains (quinoa and barley), vege (mushrooms, zucchini, tomatoes) and of course the pork. The pork collar was tender and served with purple cabbage. According to the menu, it is served with apple salad but really, it was cabbage salad. There was only 10 strips of apple in there. It was still pretty good though.As for drinks, I heard that the coffee is exceptional but I went for the hot chocolate. It was one of the best hot chocolate I have had - dark choc base with just enough sugar to be a drink. Lip smacking delicious! The creaminess means you do have to grab that free flow water they provide though!Overall, it was a delicious meal but if I were to visit again, it will have to be a non-peak period.",

    "text": "This place has major issues. I made a reservation for 12:30 pm on a Friday. I got multiple texts and calls from the restaurant to confirm my reservation. You'd think by making a reservation online, that's confirmation enough? I confirmed my reservation a second time, and arrived at 12:30. They didn't have a table for me, and asked me if I would mind sitting at the counter (I would) before scrambling to clear another table. I was placed elbow to elbow with another group. They have one too many tables shoved in here, and people were constantly bumping into me. Waiters brought the wrong dishes to multiple people, including me. There's a $50 minimum if paying by visa or MasterCard...unfortunately this was one of few occasions when I didn't consult yelp first, so I didn't bring cash. I ordered the burger, coconut smoothie, strawberry sundae, and two tarts to fulfill the $50 quota. The burger was absolute s**t. I hadn't eaten all day so I figured I'd be happy with whatever I got, and with the first bite was proven wrong. Gooey, messy, falling apart, no intentional flavors...just a train wreck. It was served on a tiny wooden platter. The burger was sopping wet and dripping with juices which quickly slid off the small platter and made a mess of the table. The cheese on it was supposedly gruyere, but had none of the flavors I love in a gruyere. Could've been any basic processed garbage. I begrudgingly ate about a quarter of it before giving up and sating my hunger with the cold fries that came as a side. The coconut smoothie was sweet without being too sugary, and had a noticeable but not overpowering mint flavor. Strawberry sundae was disappointing. The jelly cubes didn't add much, and the bread pieces were hard and unappetizing. I got the tarts to go, so I haven't tried them yet. There's no reason to come here. Food is awful, seating is cramped, most patrons are loud hipster types trying to sound impressive (girl next to me wanted to be an American and was trying so hard to put on an accent, making up shit about the US as if she'd been there etc), and prices are stupidly high for the quality. I'm continually disappointed in Singapore. There are so many confused attempts at hipster cafes. Singapore could use its cultural diversity to make something fresh and innovative, but instead I see mediocre restaurants more often than not.",

    "text": "So the November YUBE brought us to Populus, a new brunch/coffee place. \u00a0At first glance, it has all the right elements for a hot brunch spot - central location, designerish hipster decor, coffee + sale of coffee related gadgets and an interesting brunch menu. \u00a0In fact by the time we left the place (around 1 pm on sat), there was a line of people waiting for a table. \u00a0The problem though is actually with the food itself. \u00a0Having read that their scrambled egg was good, I ordered the populus scramble and the scrambled egg itself is indeed good - just right degree of runny, light creamy smooth but I found the seasoning a bit off. \u00a0There was the use of a few middle-eastern seasoning (think I tasted cumin in one of the other dishes) but somehow it didn't really go with the ingredients. \u00a0Also, I found the use of feta cheese AND bacon in the same dish a bit too much, definitely my scrambled egg could be at least 20 - 30% less salty and there should really only be one feature flavor there to go with the lightness of the egg. The coffee is good from my limited tasting of the flat white, very smooth and balanced. \u00a0I tried some of the corn pancake someone else ordered but that was a bit dy and bland. Perhaps it is the middle eastern twist they are trying to introduce into their dishes, it reminds me of Ottolenghi in London but precisely, its problem is it lacks the good blending of flavors, spices and ingredients that Ottolenghi stands for. \u00a0Hopefully they will improve on the food quality since I did enjoy sitting there in its bright airy interiors. \u00a0Service was good and we didn't experience the delay that some other reviewers experienced so maybe they have improved on that front.",

Basically they have some good selections, though it is a little pricey, but that is to be expected in Singapore. It is also a little out of the way, but it is certainly worth checking out.",

    "text": "One of the most reliable and delicious brunch place in Singapore for me! Definitely reflected by the crowd constantly seen in line outside the shop. Recommended to make reservations ahead of time but if you're nearby and early, you can usually walk in before 10am. The industrial decor with wooden tables and old-school bulbs and geometrical light shades make the place especially comfortable. Due to the relatively small space, the tables are however, quite close to each other. I've enjoyed most of the dishes I've tried here, especially the following: Breakfast sandwich - croissant refried with ham and scrambled eggs. Superbly giant portion so recommended for sharing. Scrambled eggs are fluffy and moist! Very nice. Ham is of good quality and full of flavor and good texture. Chicken and spring onion pancake - great texture to the fried chicken skin and lots of good flavor in the meat, not too dry. Definitely also a dish for sharing. Avocado toast - nice and refreshing dish compared the other two heavier options above. What more can I say about avocado? I've also tried the cold brew coffee. It's decent but not something I would go back for, like most other cold brews in Singapore. Very good place to go for brunch on weekends, but I would say it's not great to just stay and chill since there's always people still in line waiting for seats..",

    "text": "Populous has a nice hipster interior although a very poor table arrangement, as in the tables were so close to each other, we had to get up every time the people at the tables around us moved out. We came for brunch and had the spring onion pancake with fried chicken and scrambled egg on potato R\u00f6sti with fried mushrooms, baked beans, sausage and salad with a side of truffle fries with Parmesan cheese. As good as this all sounds we were seriously underwhelmed. Lack of seasoning in everything, soggy pancake, overly sweet baked beans, truffle fries tasted like standard industrial fries, no salt, just a minuscule sprinkling of truffle oil and Parmesan (none at the bottom of bowl). Pros: friendly service, crispy fried chicken But.... definitely not worth the 70$ for a basic, uninspiring brunch.",

    "text": "The cafe was opened not long ago along this popular stretch filled with lots of other cafes. Located in the middle of a row of shophouses. The place was narrow and long. The place was packed with a long wait list. But lucky for me there was the counter seat which nobody wanted, so I took that.Water was served when I was showed to my table.Spring Pancake & Fried Chicken ($21)spring onion & corn pancake, crispy succlent fried chicken fillets, hint of cumin, house special ranch dressingThis dish required an estimated waiting of 20 minutes, which I waited quite long for it.It looked quite sinfully with lots of sauce on the fried chicken. However I am quite disappointed to find a pool of oil on top of the pancake, after removing the chicken. The fried chicken was not crispy. In fact it was soft and doughy. The pancake was not bad with pieces of corn in it, although would prefer it to be crispy. The dressing tasted creamy rich with hints of lemony and spicy taste.Coconut, lemon & lime smoothie ($7)This milky drink was rich and thick with a minty taste.Overall the food was not bad. The place was very crowded. With long queue outside, it would be best to make reservation before coming here. Since it was very crowded, the place was quite noisy too. Topped with the background music, it was giving me a headache.",

    "text": "Aw, I wanted to be the first one to review this place :(Anyway, I had popped by here during the soft launch with some yogi friends when we were told by the folks at the Lokal a 40 minute waiting is required. Umm, we love food but we wouldn't wait that long for food.Over at the Populus, we shared a few dishes and not bad! This place is opened by the same ones behind Department of Caffeine. Needless to say, the coffee is amazing! My gf and I shared their specialty, bread pudding, otherwise known as scrambled eggs atop waffles. The scrambled eggs were wonderful--not overcooked and the perfect amount of gooey-ness. The waffles were not as nice...they had seasoned these waffles to make them savory. The seasoning: select herbs + coriander seeds. We hated the coriander seeds--much too strong for our liking. However, I do think that if you're acquainted to the strong pungent taste (as it's quite a popular spice in the region), then you'll most likely enjoy it. We'll definitely be back to try some of the other dishes and for some more coffee. Loved the ambiance as well!",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday morning for brunch with my Yelpers and I had a a tandoori chicken sandwich and an iced chocolate. I did like my iced chocolate a lot, which was made with high quality chocolate and wasn't overly sweet. My sandwich... Well... They say that size matters, and big is better, but it was so big I couldn't bite into it. The giant slab of tandoori chicken was sandwiched between two HUGE pieces of bread, and I spent an hour eating the top slice, then the bottom slice, and then the chicken. If not for the great company it would have been quite excruciating eating this one-on-one with a date. Sandwich came with some rocket salad so that was great. I think they ought to relook their choice of bread. Maybe the kopitiam style bread that is easily compressed would do better. Their food does take a while to come, but they have a disclaimer about that on their menu. I also had a taste of the spring onion pancakes and they were gummy. I don't understand why this place is packed. I'd come here for a drink and to read, if it wasn't so crowded. The food is a hit-and-miss.",

    "text": "I ordered the scrambled eggs on croissant which came with bacon and I asked to not have feta on top. For drinks, I ordered the cold drip iced coffee and an elderflower soda. It's rather a sticker shock to eat in cafes and restaurants in Singapore. Mostly the price of \"artisanal\" coffee is ridiculous. But I understand that Singapore's rent is ridiculously unaffordable so guests have to pay a premium to come to bricks and mortar cafes, bars, restaurants. My cold drip coffee which was served in a tiny glass with ice was $6. \u00a0I was suffering from major jetlag and needed extra caffeine so this obviously made me incredibly sad. The food made up for it. My friend ordered a curry chicken and truffle fries to share. I tried a bit of her chicken and it was good. Not too spicy. I can't stand when curries burn a hole in your mouth. (Insert fake Asian joke here!) it was creamy and hearty but lacking in a depth of lemongrass, galangal, and tamarind. The truffle fries were salty, just enough Parmesan for umami, and addicting! My dish was better though. The dish came out looking HUGE! I gave some to my friend. The fluffy eggs were cooked beautifully and the croissant was buttery, flaky, and soft! My only complaint would be the bacon but that's a personal preference (which many people share) of having super crispy bacon. I like my bacon crispy and these were just mediocre. Would I come back here? Sure but I'll try something else.",

Everything is Instagrammable to the hexagonal wall paneling, the Edison bulbs, the water glasses, and of course the food and drinks themselves. As expected, there's about a 30-45 minute queue for brunch when I went mid-day on a Saturday. They have a nice system where you can sign up via an app and they'll call you automatically when your table is ready. The one thing I don't like is that there's no table service. This is a place that for the price and the ambiance, you'd think there would be table service. You get seated when you arrive with menus, then you're given a table number and are told to order at the counter with it when you're ready. It's a little confusing. The food itself is creative yet familiar and all done really well. My cousin got the roasted chicken grain bowl and that flavor was . His girlfriend got the cod with soba which was delicious and fresh as that dish always is. My limited edition beef rendang donburi was aight, I just discovered I'm not much of a beef rendang person so I can't fault them for that. Overall, if you're looking for a trendy brunch place in the red dot, Populus is a solid option.",

We were told to wait 15-30 minutes but thankfully there was a counter seat which we were happy to have, so no waiting. We had the Populus scrambled eggs, pulled pork bowl, piccolo and flat white which came up to about 50 bucks. I really enjoyed the mains as they were plated well, and very tasty. The scrambled eggs came piled on a croissant which was light and moist. I especially enjoyed the pulled pork which consisted of quinoa, barley, generous amounts of pork and a good variety of vegetables though I wished there were more greens.The coffee was mediocre. It wasn't bad but it was more acidic than we prefer so we'd hop over to Nylon for coffee instead.The service was inconsistent. On one hand, the staff were friendly. On the other, they didn't seem to anticipate customers' needs. Case in point, a waiter came by with a set of fork and knife, and fork and spoon. He asked who was having the bowl. When I said we were sharing, he just left the cutlery and left. I would have expected him to return with another set of knife and spoon but he didn't and I had to request for it when the food was served.I'd return for the pulled pork bowl.",

    "text": "The sister of Department of Caffeine is pretty new to the cafe scene but they are already drawing a crowd (do make a reservation to avoid the wait). Coffee is actually a focus here and they even have 3 different blends of espresso- Monolith (comforting and reassuring), Caldera (upligting and refreshing), and Duxton Vice (cheeky and adventurous). It's obvious which i chose! No doubt which i am. Coffee is priced from $4.50. Filter coffee of African origins are available too. My iced mocha was more milky than anything and i couldn't taste the coffee even though the chocolate wasn't sweet. A brunch hit is the Populus Scrambled ($18) which features eggs with fresh herb melange, marinated feta, and streaky bacon on top of a toasted croissant. The eggs could have been more runny. These were a little more cooked than i like but at least it didn't soak the flaky and buttery croissant. The bacon could do with more browning though. It's a decent brunch option however.Perfect sweet mornings would begin with the Baked Pistachio French Toast ($19). Well this is actually a candy crusted brioche bread pudding with red wine poached pears, lemon curd, yuzu mascarpone, pistachio crumb, thyme infused pure maple syrup and flowers. Loved the moist fruit chunks (probably apple and pear) in the soggy-ish brioche, complemented with cornflakes bits.The Buckwheat Pancake ($20.50) in a skillet could be described as a thick pancake or a flat fluffy cake, which wasn't too dry but it wasn't moist either. It was just.. undecided? Likewise, I couldn't decide if i liked this or not. It was simply a canvas for that tangy berry fruit compote, passionfruit curd, and cornflake crumb. It also felt like they kept reusing the same ingredients in the Pistachio French Toast. In fact, we saw many common elements in our dishes. Share this. I imagine I'd get sick of it after a bit.For something more lunchy, go with the grain bowls which use a base of quinoa, Bulgar wheat and pearl barley, like the savory Pulled Pork Grain Bowl ($18). I thought it was a seemingly Asian dish with the pickled cabbage apple slaw and furikake though the preparation and ingredients used were more Mediterranean. Our surprise birthday desserts were the Dark Chocolate Sundae ($13) and the Earl Grey Chocolate Cake. I was surprised by the rich flavor of the chocolate ice cream even though it had a very light texture. It's a return of the common ingredients of curd, berries puree, cornflakes, yada yada yada which got really old by the end of the meal. The cake sponge in the mix was meh at best.Give me something no frills like the Earl Grey Chocolate slice anytime. Loved the intense earl grey flavor and it had the dense brownie type of texture. The Populus Coffee & Food Co. certainly gives its neighbor, The Lokal, a run for their money. Well more options for us i guess. I think i prefer this.",

    "text": "This place has an interesting and unique menu. There are a variety of stylized meat dishes, popular grain and vegetable bowls, and a full selection of coffee shop favorites. In my two visits, I've tried the pork collar and beef ragu pasta. Both dishes were quite tasty and served up in a high-class style. The quality of ingredients is generally quite good. They mix meats, grains, and vegetables well to provide more balance than you typically find eating out. Dishes cost around $25 and drinks are around $5. The dining area is extremely small and crowded. The tables are cramped and there is almost no aisle space for walking, which adds to the discomfort of patrons and interferes with the servers' jobs as well. On a Sunday morning, it was like attending a rock concert. However, during a weekday visit, it was still cramped, but manageable.",
