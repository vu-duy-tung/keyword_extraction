For the entree we had chicken rice which was awesome. I definitely recommend this for a local meal. We also had the green dragon vegetables (delicious!) and a tofu soup that was awesome. The overall restaurant was very nice and clean and clearly it's a place that locals frequent. I would definitely recommend for a sit down meal and good local flavors.",

My wife wanted to walk out, but as good people, we waited. Finally the chicken dish arrived and we tucked in to succulent meal. Meat was tender and the rice fragrant, my rating is based on the service rended.My take: PR Dept of Boon Tong Kee, please arrange some training for your front line staff as they are the ambassadors of your business. The atmosphere killed the enjoyment of having dinner here.",

That boneless white tender chicken served on a bed of broth boiled rice took my mother AGES to make from scratch in the UK and was an absolute treat... however, when in Singapore HCR is available on every corner you turn around. #yeay We have been to Boon Tong Kee a number of times, and stumbled across the one on Balister Road after our temple visits. The restaurant is clean and the staff have the usual stiff upper lip until you warm them up with some \"xie xie's\" and attempting to banter with them. We of course ordered a plate of HC which come with individual bowls of rice (hells yeh). The chicken never fails, especially when you top it off with ginger, sweet soy and chilli. We also ordered a range of dishes from fried tofu (hells yes), baby spinach with salted and century egg, a Cantonese fave, broccoli and mushrooms, \"gourmet\" fried spring rolls and the seafood horfun. Special shout outs to the tofu which was light with the perfect amount of salty coating and the horfun. Sweet baby J, the horfun was to die for. The sheets themselves were the fattest I've seen. The seafood fresh. The sauce, solid. I was so full but kept going back for more. Downside: A LOT of MSG. MSG is killing my food vibe in Singapore. Please pass me my water bottle, please and thank you.",

Flaky , moist and just seasoned right. The sauce didnt overpower and just the right amount. It was delish. It a little pricey $24 SGD but it was a good portion.I m not sure if this is common to charge customer for towellete and the peanut for what I taught it was a complimentary when the server brought it to us from the beginning.

Came here on the second day of CNY and the line was insane with over an hour wait. We had heard the claypot rice here was quite popular and thus we ordered ahead while waiting for our table so the timing synced up. Alas, the claypot rice is alright but very forgettable. But the dependable staples didn't disappoint. Love the fragrant savory rice here. I can eat bowls of it! Paired with the silken white skin and moist chicken, it just works. Another staple, that fried tofu. Impeccable delicate and soft on the inside with a light crispy exterior. I don't know how it holds its texture but when dipped in the salad dressing, so yummy! Oh and that char siew that's already on your table when you're seated... it's just sublime. Being CNY, we also ordered lo hei for some festive cheer and our server was really personable in preparing it. But for everyday classics that won't disappoint, the chicken rice, fried tofu, and char siew are winners for sure. Also this location is open late which is a plus for supper cravings.",

Being the loving daughter that I am, I opted to celebrate this momentous occasion in an air conditioned environment. :) I normally do take away here, so dining in was a new experience.Unfortunately, our server could barely speak English, yet she still tried to upsell us by suggesting I order the more expensive, not boiled chicken. After declining, I asked for iced water and instead got some weird coconut drink. If you can't even understand the word \"water\" that's definitely a problem. She did manage to get the rest of our order correct, probably because I pointed on the menu.Despite this, my dad truly enjoyed it, and our bill was under $20. (Then again, we weren't hungry so we didn't order a lot of food.) Takeaway is still a pleasant experience, as the line moves quickly and the food remains tasty by the time I get home. Because of this, I maintain my 4 star rating.",

Being a well-established brand, it is safe to bring your overseas visitors to Boon Tong Kee for their first taste of our famous Singapore chicken rice.But i feel that the standard has dropped since they decided to expand their branches, and the few that still has standard are their River Valley and Balestier road branchesSide dishes to order when eating there are their bean sprouts and oyster vegetables. A must have to complement the tasty chicken rice.",

Normally I would have put a 5 stars however, \u00a0I was not happy for the fact that their was only a wet naps per persom on the table, \u00a0no napkins to either wipe your hands or mouth. We \u00a0obviously used the wet naps as it was the only thing on the table to wipe our hands and when the bill came.... SURPRISE!!! There was a 0.30$ charge for each wet nap!! Seriously the waitress should have told us! Anyways, \u00a0I would go back only for the chicken rice but for the rest, not that impressed!",

    "text": "I came here in hopes of a spirit-lifting meal, but was left disappointed. After being so highly recommended, even by one of my closest friends I found this spot right next to the Shaw Plaza on Balestier road. The service was excellent, quickly showing me to my table and getting my order, it was chicken rice of course. The chicken rice was quickly served, but the first error was spotted when a dirty fork was given to me, I cringe at the very thought... disgusting. I had it replaced and started on the meal. It was utterly a disappointment! The rice was dry and so was the chicken, very difficult to swallow and generally just a complete disappointment! Totalling a 9 dollar something bill I honestly believe and with full conviction say that the average $2.50 chicken rice you find at standard kopitiams are like a million times better! Stay away!This is my first 1-star review, it was truly a let down!",

Boon Tong Kee is undoubtedly part of the Singapore chicken rice fame and this Balestier outlet is the first and original branch in Singapore. Over the years it has attracted many tourists and locals alike to try what was hailed as the best chicken rice in Singapore.I remember the best part of the meal was the rice. It was glistening smooth, moist and savoury. One could finish the rice easily without mixing it with the ingredients. The chicken was a hit-or-miss, depending on which day you visit the outlet - meaning it isn't always excellent. That said, it's still a pretty decent meal, though pricier than most chicken rice stalls out there.Oh, and they open till the wee hours.",

The rice is fragrant and perfectly cooked. The \u00a0chicken is very good. We had fish and vegetables too. All good and tasty. You still pay through your nose, but now its worth it.",
