    "text": "$16 for a vegetarian sandwich??? I thought id try it cause it's the closest restaurant to my work place and I honestly think I need to eat at the hawker centre opposite for the next week cause I just feel guilty for how much I spent. as a vegetarian, the only option is the broccoli falafel sandwich. The first few bites are nice but after that it just feels heavy and lacks a complexity to enjoy. Each bite is just filled with this bitterness from the broccoli which I personally couldn't enjoy. Not a place I would come back to.",

    "text": "I was there when Park Bench Deli first opened its door (in July) along the buzzling Teluk Ayer street and thought I'll never go back. Music was too loud, \u00a0weird opening hours (closes by 3pm mon-friday), no proper seating and slightly over priced food. And then, one fine afternoon a few weeks later, I walked in again, this time with my colleague (just because we ran out of food choice for lunch) and it changes everything. It was a buy 1 get 1 free promotion for that week, so paying $14 for 2 sandwiches sounds about right and reasonable. I ordered the famous kong ba bahn mi sandwich as well as fried chicken sandwhich and both were pretty good and solid. My colleague ordered \u00a0\"Torta\" (slow roasted pork) as well as cheese steak sandwich, also as good. It has been 4 months since the opening and I can say PBD had matured in a good way. From serving breakfast and lunch initially, they serve dinner now meaning opening hours have been extended to 10pm. Dinner menu isn;t extensive, but they execute each item well. I had the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup last night together with chicken nuggets. It was so good, I dont mind working out extra hours the next day at the gym. Not forgetting, they carry craft beer on tap too (now we're talking) as well as some imported beer like Deschutes from Oregon (my fav!) and Koshihikari Echigo from Japan. PBD definitely tops my to-go place along Teluk Ayer street if I want something simple and fuss free. It's self service - menu board is on your left as you enter, choose what you want and walk towards the counter to place your order. Your food will be ready in minutes before you know it! Staffs are friendly too!",

    "text": "Good renditions of American sandwiches served here, some of which I have not seen in a really long while.The sandwiches I know and love and were so darn hard to find in Singapore, I have finally found here. I'm talking about sandwiches such as the cheesesteak, cubano and patty melt. I've visited on a couple of occasions. They do a good version of the cuban sandwich, and it is pretty close to the countless cubanos I've eaten in Florida and Georgia. My only gripe is that it was pulled pork inside, instead of pork slices, and the sandwich came diagonally sliced, the very first sandwich I ever encountered cut this way. I really wish it came with mojito sauce and some plantains.The cheesesteak is suitably greasy and stuffed with meat, just the way I like it. Biting into it is pretty amazing with all that cheesy goodness. Now if only there were a few more onions in there.Overall, the sandwiches don't come cheap at between $10-16 each, but when you can't find them elsewhere, you pay up and get transported to sandwich heaven. Beggars can't be choosers. (Till I catch the next flight back)",

I saw a photo of their Cubano sandwich (only served during lunch) and I was floored- it was thick (a rarity in SG) and had everything it was supposed to have. I really want to try it sometime!I came in during dinner, so I tried their grilled cheese and tomato soup. I believe they used rye bread. Cheeses include cheddar and emmenthal. I do like rye bread, however I thought it was a tad too bitter for me. Luckily the roasted tomato soup helped cut the bitterness down by a lot.I must come back for that Cubano.--*Personally, I am done with coffee shops. If you're going to be hipster, try bringing in more sandwiches, bagels, and doughnut shops, please!",

The size of the sandwichs are \u00a0large and filling. Definitely getting your money's worth. Lots of craft brew, and don't forget the wine either. Come and try anything. You won't regret it.",

The downside (or maybe the upside) to the cheesesteak is that you will need a nap after you're through with it. On the lighter side of things, the turkey sandwich is great. All in all, top quality sandwiches worth the visit.",

Went during office lunch hour and waited over 20 minutes for my peanut butter & jelly sandwich. I suspect the kitchen forgot my order since quite a few customers who ordered after me got their sandwiches before me. My sandwich only came after I probed about it. (The thing about having an open kitchen is that customers are able to see when the cooks physically put the sandwich on the grill.) When probed if my order was forgotten, the lady at the counter explained that they did not forget my sandwich and that the grill was small and hence could not accommodate many sandwiches (that doesn't explain why customers who ordered later than me got their orders before mine...).Was it worth the wait?Perhaps my expectations were too high, but the peanut butter & jelly sandwich was just disappointing. It was special, yes, cornflake crusted with chocolate bread. But it tasted... Meh. However, everything aside, I will give Park Bench Deli another try (I really wanted to like it!). Just not during lunch hour and not the peanut butter & jelly.",

The owner is very friendly and came up to chat when he saw that I was holding a box of Plain Vanilla cupcakes. There are two clear signs when you walk up to the counter, one for ordering and the other for pick-ups. All of their lunch sandwiches come in a hoagie, except for the cubano. I opted for the cubano and a bottle of water, which came to $17.50. While the sandwich was pricey, it weighted more than a brick from all the meat. It's probably the first time I haven't been able to finish something in Singapore. I ended up just eating half and saved the rest for later. The cubano was crispy on the outside with a good balance of mustard, ham, and cheese. It is inevitable to make a mess, so be prepared to use lots of napkins and wet wipes. Will def be back soon to try their pork banh mi and PB&J sammie.",
