With a sampling of pretty much every cuisine you can imagine found here and the quality of the food being quite consistent, you definitely get your money's worth dining here. The service is also friendly and professional without being too overbearing. A good time to visit would be during birthdays as they serve a complimentary cake so this might be something of interest to take note of.",

The chefs are artists, each cuisine tastes authentic. The menu is thoughtfully planned. I can never eat all that I want to, even if I'm just tasting all the things I do eat! Everything is so fresh and freshly prepared. Eggs to order is just scratching the surface. Fresh juice included. Fruits, nuts, cereals breads, rices, noodles, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Malay, European...Congee, Chyavanmushi, etc. etc..come for breakfast, leave having eaten brunch. No bloating, no fullness, just a blissed out tummy, reveling in food heaven!! Intuitive and attentive personalized attention to detail, they greet you by name. It takes a special team to make every guest feel valued. The managers must do everything right to run with such a well orchestrated team, with perfect coordination between kitchens, service area and dining area.The Par Excellence Service is the Jewel, in the Conrad crown called Oscars!",

I miss my local food so I skip the toast and muffins and head straight for whatever local selections they have for the day. I'm normally not impressed when hotels try to offer local fare but I have to say their local food is pretty good. The service here is very prompt, possibly one of the best when it comes to buffet places.",

    "text": "I feel that Oscar's is the kind of place that doesn't really feel like \"just 3 stars\", yet is it on the same level of any other restaurant/eatery I've rated 4 stars? No, not really.So take this rating with a pinch of salt then. Oscar's is slightly above average as hotel buffets go.I entered Oscar's with pretty low expectations. Recent buffets fresh in my mind include Carousel, The Buffet at M Hotel, and one other one that was so mediocre I don't even remember where it was.First thing you notice as you walk around the buffet. Oscar's has oysters, and there're 3-4 types. They're also all shucked to order. There's sashimi, and those are all cut to order to. The night I went, there was Swordfish toro sashimi, and it was spectacular. The fatty, buttery goodness of the swordfish was very memorable, and I'm dying to find out if it's a regular feature on the buffet line (apparently the buffet last night was the \"earth hour buffet\").Hot stations featured a salmon in puff pastry (gave that a miss) and a very delicately cooked, perfectly medium rare Beef Wellington. The beef was moist, tender, and pink, and the mushroom gravy was very flavourful (though a bit too rich). There was a seafood pesto linguine that was surprisingly good, and very fragrant... and the juice offering of pineapple, lychee, and mint (called the earth trio, so I suspect that was a special feature) was absolutely scrumptious. Though maybe a bit less pineapple would have made the flavours more balanced.The waffles made to order were crisp, just a little bit salty so that they made a perfect accompaniment to all that ice cream, and it pretty good ice cream too. Maple walnut is always a winner.It of course, wasn't all perfect. The other desserts were fairly mediocre, the pear and ginger crumble tart was all crumble and no pear, a lot of the other cooked dishes were only fairly mediocre. The chicken in garlic crust? Horrible. Veal in mushroom sauce? Okay, but the sauce was again, a trifle too rich. Oh. The roasted baby potatoes were delicious, and the Polenta cakes well executed. So it wasn't all bad.Another thing I liked was coffee and tea being included in the buffet. Specifically, Ronnefeldt tea. It's a brand that Raffles Hotel used to use, and I genuinely like the teas they have on offer. Peppermint and Earl Grey are both excellent, and their Chamomile is also very fragrant (comes served with a pot of honey too).So, mediocre dishes aside, Oscar's definitely impressed. Service was attentive, food was definitely of a good level. This might just be my new \"go-to\" hotel buffet. Of course, it helps that I can book it via Chope (which I did for this visit actually!).",
