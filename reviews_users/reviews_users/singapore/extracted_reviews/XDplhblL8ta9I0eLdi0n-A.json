It is also CHEAPER than Tian Tian. \u00a0:)",

    "text": "Located just a few stalls down from Tian Tian chicken rice is their biggest competitor created from a spat between the original owner. The queue for Tian Tian on a sunday afternoon at 12pm had easily 50 people in line, Ah Tai on the other hand, only had maybe 5-10 people.Sadly though the lady in front of me ordered 18 boxes of chicken rice which resulted in a bottleneck.Watching them prepare 18 boxes of chicken rice let me see first hand how much work went into preparing the chicken rice. As you can see the background, the man with the cap was fishing out several whole chicken bones from the soup! It's no wonder the soup was so tasty and yet not peppery! I didn't feel too thirsty after drinking half a bowl of soup.I was very happy with my plate of chicken rice. The rice was flavourful and the chicken was very moist and tender, so much better than the Yishun 925 chicken rice I just had a few days ago. I happily gulped down the entire plate and I will definitely be back with more friends and family to devour a whole chicken next time!",

Good thing i checked-out Yelp for other Chicken Rice places nearby. Ah Tai had great reviews and it did not disappoint!Had abit of trouble communicating with the shop since their english wasn't the best. Good thing there was a good samaritan who translated for us! The chicken was excellent and the rice was perfect! Perfectly cooked, very flavorful and the sauces - soy, ginger and chili - were perfect complements to the dish!As it turns out, the original chef from Anthony Bourdain's show move down this food stall. So I didn't miss out after all! You haven't had Singaporean Chicken Rice until you've eaten here! Trust me!Will we be coming back? Yes, everytime we're in Singapore!",

I ordered the chicken rice set for $5 and it was so much food! It came with rice, chicken, veggies, and a soup (plus the 3 dipping sauces for the chicken). The old man puts everything on the tray. The chicken was delicious. The rice was delicious. The veggies were delicious. And the soup was delicious. Get the idea? The red chili dipping sauce was my favorite out of the three. The yellow one (ginger or garlic based maybe?) was also good. Really yummy place for hainanese chicken rice!",

I heard that the founder of Ah Tai chicken rice had some links to Tian Tian chicken rice for a start, maybe not related by blood but in terms of skills in preparing the chicken rice.The rice is flavorful, chilli, spicy hut not overpowering. For the chicken meat, tenderness is just right, not too soft, not too tough. Do not forget the ginger sauce as well, this adds a kick to the taste when you eat it.Price wise seems a little cheaper than Tian Tian but they open 7 days a week so that is a big plus! This is especially so when you need nice food on Mondays, where a lot of stalls tend not to be open.One thing to note is that you should specify if you want the cheaper smaller option, else they will charge the larger portion by default.",

It doesn't help that even though there are a total of 4 stalls selling chicken rice, the queues at Ah Tai are always long so be sure to get there early to avoid disappointment (he closes when everything is sold out).",

    "text": "my friend and i came here last night to try the chicken rice. \u00a0the original plan was to go to both ah tai and tian tian and get a plate of chicken rice from each place. \u00a0the chicken rice war between the two has been well-documented, so we were eager to decide who was the winner. \u00a0unfortunately, tian tian was closed already (it was only 7 pm!), so we couldn't do a comparison.we got a chicken rice meal for SGD 4.50, which came w/ a bowl of soup and a side of veg. \u00a0the plate of chicken itself was quite small (much smaller than what i remember from tian tian, although it may be b/c it was a meal special). \u00a0it was tasty, and the rice was good. \u00a0the chicken was also quite lean yet juicy. \u00a0i think i still need to do an assessment by comparing them head-to-head.",

    "text": "Back for our yearly trip and since we were close to Maxwell food court, I decided to head in to grab some Hainan chicken and rice. Once we entered, I quickly saw a long ass line that had formed for Tian Tian. Since it was a hot and muggy day (typical Sing weather) I quickly remembered a good friend mentioning that Ah Tai was as good if not better than Tian Tian. Glanced over and saw that there were only 2 people in line, I made a b line over. Pricing wise, both are similarly priced (IIRC) but Ah Tai didn't have a long ass queue. Within 5 minutes, I was inside an air conditioned taxi and headed back to the hotel room to eat.At first glance, both places offer a cheap and tasty lunch/dinner. The main difference between the two was how fragrant the rice is at Ah Tai. I don't remember Tian Tian being as fragrant and actually thought the rice texture at Tian Tian was slightly off the last time I ate there. The chicken at both places were good, tender and moist but Ah Tai does throw in some veggies which is a nice addition to the regular dish.Will have to do a head to head comparison next year but for now, Ah Tai reigns king in my book for chicken and rice.",

    "text": "A friend of mine visited Singapore before me and told me that if I did anything on my trip, it had to be visiting at least one Hawker Centre. We were recommended the Maxwell Centre and headed this way to see what we could grub on before our buffet dinner; we're little fatties, we know. Like many before us, we were hoping to check out Tian Tian. Don't judge us for being basic, Anthony Bourdain was a gd international treasure!! Unfortunately for us, it was closed on the Monday we visited. Luckily, we spotted Ah Tai just a few stalls down. Our Hainanese Chicken cravings needed to be met, so we handed over a cook $5 SGD and were presented with a lovely plate of rice with a good serving of chicken and bok choy, a side of broth, and a few dipping sauces. The broth was nice and light, flavorful but not salty. It was just a bit too toasty in the Centre for me to really enjoy hot broth. The bok choy was great, and paired really nicely with the flavors of the tender chicken and aromatic and soft rice. And of course, the dipping sauces were an excellent addition to the meal (but I'm just a sucker for dipping sauces). My sister and I shared this plate, and it was just enough for a nice snack for the both of us. It was so tasty we considered getting another, but figured we should try some other things while we were there. For $5 though, Ah Tai is probably the tastiest, most slammin' deal you'll find in all of Singapore.",

Tried to go to the famous Tian Tian chicken spot, but they ran out of chicken (maybe a blessing in disguise?). Saw that quite the line was forming at this place so decided to give it a try. So glad I did! Ordered the chicken set which came with soup, chicken, bok choy, rice, and 2 sauces. All that came out to 5 SGD. The rice was fragrant with garlic and ginger. I could eat the rice alone. The chicken was super tender and paired so well with the chili sauce. The chili sauce packed a punch and had a nice spicy kick to it. Honestly didn't bother to try the soy sauce looking sauce since I liked the chili sauce so much.Liked this place so much, think I'm going to try to for another visit to this place before I leave Singapore in the next few days!",

That is all you need to know, lol!Located in the Maxwell food court in the middle aisle, it's a few shops next to the famed Tian Tian shop reviewed by Anthony Bourdain as the best Hainanese chicken rice. I wish I was able to compare, but we came on a Monday and the shop was closed (much to our dismay)! We were only in Singapore for two days with Monday being the last full day, so we came to Ah Tai since it was voted by locals as the best Hainanese chicken rice. Plus, the dish is one of ten you must eat in Singapore, so duh...we couldn't leave without trying!All you need to know is their chicken rice set comes complete and for only $5!! Comes with seasoned rice, a plate of bok choy, chicken, soup and three different types of sauces to complement your chicken. I especially loved the ginger, but the chili sauce is just as enjoyable. Since it's a food court, seat anywhere as you please. The shop is super tiny and it's run by three dudes. One guy chopping the chicken, one guy plating the sides and the other handling business. They were very friendly, welcoming, and happy at 11am even though most of the stalls were still setting up. Glad I got to try this!",

    "text": "Upon my arrival in Singapore, I had chicken rice on the mind. \u00a0Given that I arrived just after midnight, my search would have to wait a few hours. \u00a0After a few hours of sleep, I was on my way to Maxwell Centre to find this dish. \u00a0I knew enough to avoid the lunch rush hours so I made my way over there just after 1 pm. \u00a0I saw the line for Tian Tian first but from my research I knew to look left for Ah Tai's stall. \u00a0And there it was. \u00a0I look another look at Tian Tian, Bourdain's picture and quotes plastered on the side and their menu and asked myself if I should really give this a try. \u00a0Hipsters foodies couldn't be wrong, could they? \u00a0Ultimately, the research I had performed looking through local/Singapore reviews won out and I found myself drifting over to Ah Tai to try the food from the person that originally made Tian Tian's chicken what it is today.There was one person in front of me, so the wait was minimal. \u00a0I ordered the steamed chicken rice, which came with rice, pieces of chicken breast, cucumbers and a bowl of the chicken broth. \u00a0This is real food with the focus solely on the quality of the ingredients and the skill it takes to prepare it to ensure that its freshness is well represented. \u00a0The food was served on a warped cafeteria tray, with all my dishes and utensils sliding quickly to the four corners as soon as it was handed to me. \u00a0I kept telling myself to walk slowly and NOT DROP MY CHICKEN RICE! \u00a0The chicken was very juicy and very tender. \u00a0The rice was moist but but not wet and full of flavor. \u00a0The broth was clear and tasted of chicken, as it should. \u00a0I did not find the food to be greasy, oily or fatty. \u00a0The sauces provided enhanced the neutral chicken meat but still allowed the taste of chicken to shine through. \u00a0No shortcuts were taken here. \u00a0This is chicken done right, and all for $3. \u00a0Ridiculous. \u00a0Even though I was sitting in front of a fan, this food centre can get quite warm. \u00a0Remember to bring your own napkins. \u00a0I also purchased a sugar cane and lemon drink from one of the many beverage stalls nearby.",

Come to find out that the chef actually used to work for Tian Tian and started his own business here. Of course, we ordered the chicken and rice set. Super valuable and great food. Definitely great fix and will be back. If you're in Singapore, you have to give this place a try at least once in your lifetime!",

    "text": "Sorry Anthony Bourdain but this hawker stall's chicken rice might be slightly better than your favorite's icon fare. Since your T.V. Show the toe stalls have been battling it out for chicken rice domination. It is struggle that is virtually impossible to choose between gastronomic perfect, but I think fave to give a slight nod to these guys, for I actually found myself not caring about the added sauces and spices. Yeah, it is that good that the chicken and the rice are enough to pull it off without any extras. Truly, a very succulent dish which is well worth the line wait.***An additional note: apparently the original chief at Tian Chicken Rice, made famous by Anthony Bourdain's TV show, is no longer there but here...that explains a lot. Locals who are in the know line up for this chicken rice.",
