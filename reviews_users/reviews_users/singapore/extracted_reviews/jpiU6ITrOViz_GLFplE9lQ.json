    "text": "cute place that's conveniently located in the 'hood. sometimes, u just want a cup of artisan coffee that doesn't require a train ride to the city. expect a wait on the weekends because it's pretty small and popular. there are a few seats outside but i prefer the ambiance inside. kind of looks like a library with the amount of books lining the shelves, and it's common to see artsy-types on their macbooks scattered throughout the place. the coffee is alright. i've had better, but it's decent. the offer all-day breakfast/brunch as well as sandwiches. i've tried the turkey sandwich ($8), smoked chicken breast sandwich ($8) and turkish eggs ($8)... all good, but prefer the sandwiches. i think the desserts were even better. the grasshopper pie ($8 i think) is all sorts of yum if you like the mint + chocolate combo. also, they put orange slices in the water, which is a nice touch. i mean, this isn't the place you'd trek to if you don't live in the east, but for the easties, i'm glad it exists.",

Flavours tend to drift towards the more savoury and sometimes this can be overpowering. Stay away from the scrambled eggs. It left the impression that we were eating something like oatmeal. Too much milk or butter or both.Cakes - great selection of cakes. Goes well with their coffee.In summary, if you live on the east coast and Tanjong Katong, this is probably one of the better coffee joints around.",

    "text": "Far from granting academic degrees, least associated with research intensive facilities but this exclusive \"Institution\" - Penny University could make it to the highest coffee bar ranking in near future, if the sector ever have an achieving U15 or U21 group or alike. We are incapable of fore-speaking the future, the same goes to any economist and policy makers, hence we are in no way to crystal-ball their success, until perseverance turned fruitful.Peculiar name it has. A coffee shop - deck out interestingly in modern lighting fixtures, serving you in its customized bar and counter table tops using recycled railroad ties (by THE RAIL LIFE CO.), with a raw finishing - polished cement flooring. I walked in and find myself a table seat, adjacent to the communal table. I wish I had a chance to the booth seat for a more enclosed space or that little couch corner for a homely feel, still I had a wonderful time just people watching in the open area. I returned to the counter for my orders. The menu clip on a wooden board is not long, making your choice is a lot more easier. Serving a small range of breakfast and a few selection of tea/coffee, the friendly young lady took the orders on her electronic portable tablet. While I am charmed by the catchy wood-cut coffee menu pinned on the wall, I find the old rustic-looking cash register very striking. I don't seem to spot any functioning one (no receipts-paperless & they accept only Cash), how cool.Seconds after I made payment, I find myself honing after some treats. The see-through display shelved some mouth-watering cakes, pies, tarts (supplied by other home-grown bakeries, by Fluff Bakery, Windowsillpies) \u00a0Surely I have missed the pop-up cookies store - my lovebites on their Salted caramel butter biscuits but still managed to try a piece of \u00a0that crunchy earl grey tea almond ones.A bit nosy I confessed. I have to bring myself to ask why Penny University and not any others? Mouss - the barista & owner, was busy brewing his delicate Brazilian blend, from Oriole Coffee & Nylon Coffee Roaster. The guy who spent time learning from teachers at the London BRAT, find me hard to ignore as I was standing right in front of this World Barista champ weapon - La Marzocco. Speaking in a soft tone, he lyrically described the coffee beans used, the history behind the store name et cetra. And so, I came to know that Penny University is a term coiled in London during the 18-century - a coffeehouse where people of ALL levels are charged a penny to enter and have free access to coffee, company, latest news from reporters (\"runners\"), gossips, newspapers and bulletins. Many more coffee shops over the world then, were named \"Penny University\". How interesting to know that's how social networking came about and its evolution, wasn't it?I learn to appreciate how things fall into place, how each new start-up was conceptualized & established. The process was lengthy but each baby steps were taken painstakingly with great passion. Likewise, the 7-ounce of simply coffee and water bond together brilliantly with careful brewing method - a clean & creamy mouth-feel, less harsh. Honestly, I'd prefer this to the one using Papa Palheta roast.The breakfast toasties definitely amp up my lazy morning. I opted for a single toast instead of two but regretted as the marmite spreading the toast was marvelous. I used to make myself a slice at home but hardly these days, so when I saw them on the menu, I just know this it it! A deliberate amount is used so no worries about being overly-salted. The taste was made even more paramount when paired with cheese, supremely good! Then comes the poached eggs and a handful of rocket leaves salad to wrap up your morning - what an awakening!yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/p\u2026If you find the marmite extract too acquiring, they offer sourdough toast with butter, marmalade & fig condiments. I like the amount of heat that browned each round slices but I didn't seem to be able to locate its tangy taste. It needed a greater dose of levain. Of course, they have a few more options available.yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/p\u2026The Rock Cake makes a fabulous teatime treat. The Great Britain first had them during the WWII as one of the rationed food item. Quintessentially, a fruit cake with a jagged contour but minute-sized. Scone-alike, this fruit bun is somewhat moist and crumbly. The candied jumbo-sized dried cranberry & raisin fruits complement the cake which has been baked universally less sweet. Accompanied by a cup of brew - unmistakable. Enjoying this classics of British food, I can now claim to be part of the Harry Potter's gang.I know many dwellers in the east will make this their second home, sipping a minimal 3-ounce and engaged in a chitter-chatter.",

The harissa \u00a0 \u00a0(sauce? paste? oil?) adds some spice, and when you mix it all together with the toast they give you, it's so yum! Perfect if you're looking for a light meal. I just wish they could give more bread.On a whim, I tried their peach iced tea (not on the menu) and though it was just canned peaches mixed with tea, it reminded me so much of being back in the southern US. Very refreshing.They also have bottles of water that are free for all to access. Solid cafe!",

Alot of customers were getting cakes to go.And this was the end results, hardly any cakes left, compared to what I saw earlier in the day.Pretty much 50% of their menu were also sold out!1. Earl Grey Tea Cake $5I decided to quickly grab the last two slices of cake in the display and it was definitely worth my while. This was more like a pound cake that tasted like tea, with a hard sugary top coating. It was quite dense and great to share amongst two people.2. Tropical Earl Grey $6So moist and so good! Best cake ever!This is by far, my favourite cake. Do not like the layers of cream intimidate you, the cream isn't sweet, the cake is super moist and I even got two more slices to take home with me. Even with the cakes sitting in the fridge for 1-2 days, the cake remained moist! The tea flavour was present in every bite, and you can even smell it!3. Peppermint Iced ChocolatePeppermint Iced Chocolate $5.50This literally tasted like an \"After-Eight\" chocolate in a liquid form, the peppermint flavour wasn't too overpowering and the chocolate was very real and not too heaty. My friend and I enjoyed this so much!4. Salmon Guacamole $9.50I feel that for $9.50, this was worth every penny! There was so much salmon, I couldn't find enough bread to eat it with the salmon! The salmon tasted great and the bread was very crispy and toasty. It stayed crispy even after 10-15 minutes.5. Affogato $7One dose of Affogato at noon wasn't enough, I needed a second dose! Ice cream, coffee and gula melaka! It's heavenly, I will definitely be ordering this every single time I step into Penny University! The smell of the caffeine, just wakes you up!Cakes and the Salmon Guacamole, a perfect dinner time treat, along with the Affogato, even though almost the entire kitchen was wiped out of food and we couldn't order anything else, I was still a very happy customer. Great Cakes, Great Service and Great Coffee = Happy Customers like Me :)",

It's also really loud inside for some reason, I wouldn't hold a group meeting here cos of the echoes. I'll still come back, but only for the espresso..",

Only thing is the space is not big so if you have a big group, it may be a problem. Other than that I'd say the coffee is eorth the trip though it is slightly more on the pricey side.",

It doesn't hurt that he's a pretty cool guy to talk to as well.He's spoken to local roasters Nylon Coffee as well, and they've come on board as one of his suppliers, along with Oriole as well - supporting the locals is yet another reason to love this place.Some stuff they've got on the menu include sweet treats from Windowsill Pies, and today I had some pretty awesome turkish eggs too! Poached to perfection, and spiced with harissa, they were just begging to be mopped up with some tasty sourdough, which they cleverly included. Heck, I loved that sourdough so dang much I ordered an extra portion with earl grey+fig jam, and finished that too.Closing thoughts? Cool joint, good coffee, a bike rack outside? HECK YES. Plus I love that he's got a little window right next to the espresso machine - perfect for takeaway coffees!",

(even though the staff recommend this. hm.) maybe I am not a turkish breakfast person. just a simple american breakfast person. 3. cafe latte (7 ounce, double shot) - strong! - we initially asked for an extra shot because the staff told us 7 ounce will be \"diluted with milk\" and we wanted to start the day with a good coffee. I guess 2 shot was overkill? the kind of bitter only diehard coffee lovers can love. I am more a mainstream coffee person. 4. smore tart - THE BEST!!! seriously, based on this item alone the place is worth a visit. the chocolate melts in your mouth! Total: $27Ambiance: nice vintage coffee joint :) great selection of magazines and books to read too (which is the perfect place to catchup on some reading on a lazy afternoon or during the late evenings when there aren't too many people. mornings tend to get crowded.) Cons: (which could have, but did not, make me give them 3 star. i believe in this place!!! it's definitely a raising start despite a few initial shortcomings... :) - cash payment only. - limited selection of brunch food (basically toast and eggs? both of which they do very well but I need something more substantial to start the day) I heard they are working on more dishes soon? can't wait to see what's installed. if it's anything like their perfect poached eggs and sourdough toast then it could potentially be a 5 star joint!",

Wanted to go for kopi, and saw this place opened, and noticed the two bicycles outside of this Penny University. So we went in to check it out.The manager was very friendly, told us about the drinks and food that you offer. And he happily took our orders. The food were brought to us, and drinks followed a little bit later. The coffee drinks were great. The cupcakes were good. Since this is pre-openning, there is no charge. Tips were welcomed.This is \u00a0a clean contemporary English decorated coffeehouse, attracts young people to hang up. I believe this place opens early like 8:00am serving breakfast and closes at 9:00pm weekdays, and 10:00pm weekends.I didn't check if they have free WIFI. I will ask them the next time I go there, it is walk distance to my house on Telok Kurau Road.",

Not sure why they decided to waste some space on the \"porch\", resulting in less space inside.My first visit, I opted for a flat white in the bigger cup (forgot what the size is called), felt it was too thin, like I was drinking milk instead of coffee. Subsequently opted for the smaller cup and the mix was just nice.They're reasonably near where I stay, although not the nearest coffee shop (that'd be Loysel's Toy). But I'll definitely be back, as I'm regularly in the area.Parking can be quite limited especially during lunch and dinner hours, be prepared to scout/camp for lots.",
