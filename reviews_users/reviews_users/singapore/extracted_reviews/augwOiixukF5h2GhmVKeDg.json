They have an ENORMOUS menu, but sadly not a lot of it is vegan -- but there are definitely still plenty of choices for vegans.I ordered the vegan mutton rice because I've never had mock mutton before and I was intrigued. And it was very good -- no gross soy-meat or other faux-meat aftertaste at all. It was nice and spicy, just the way I like it, and it came presented in a giant pyramid that I enjoyed gleefully demolishing like a small evil child.Atmosphere-wise, the place is quiet, pleasant, air-conditioned and not too fancy. The service seemed a little surly, but it didn't really bother me.All in all, good food and if I lived in Singapore I'd be back to check out their other vegan options!",

Wasn't greasy.Overall my 3 guy friends - all meat eaters - were pleasantly surprised with their fried prata dish, thali(?) and my food, which they tried. I think I liked it less than them though. Guess I'd go straight for the non-mock meat vegetarian dishes if I come back. Prices were very reasonable!",

In the US, you find a lot of Chinese restaurants like Loving Hut offering mock-meat entrees, but this place has the Indian and Malay influence on the dishes. In addition, I also saw that they take credit cards - so off I went to try it out. I ordered the chicken tikka (made of soy) - which is baked in the tandoori oven. This was an appetizer, but there was a lot of tikkas and they were delicious! I was almost full by the time I finished the appetizer. For the main course, I ordered the chettinad \"mutton\" curry hot plate (made of soy as well) with a side order of tandoori Roti. \u00a0This was spicy and just amazing! \u00a0The Roti was awesome too! \u00a0I washed all of it down with an ice Mooru (light salted buttermilk with spices) and masala chai. The masala chai was not that great. Overall it's a pretty unique place and highly recommended.",

Mushroom Kurma, Butter Chicken, Palak Paneer, Allo Gobi. Have it with rice or butter naan.

So far it was brilliant and I was overjoyed at coming here. Then for main course we ordered Parata set and Kochu parata set.
