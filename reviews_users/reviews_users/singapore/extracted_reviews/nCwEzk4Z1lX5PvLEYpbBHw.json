    "text": "Swatow Restaurant is quite a popular with the older generation and it is well known for its teochew cuisine. On friday night, the restaurant also offers teochew opera show, which is quite rare to see these days. The restaurant is located opposite the library, on top of the supermarket. Although the building is quite old, there is a small lift to the restaurant which can fit 2 persons in it. This is great as a lot of people coming to this restaurant are quite old.The restaurant is decorated in quite the old school and no frill way, with traditional opera clothes at the entrance. As the restaurant is quite popular, it is best to make reservation before coming.Today the family is coming here for the hi-tea buffet which costs $22.80++ for an adult and $16.80++ for a child. Although the family have made reservation for hi-tea buffet which usually occurs from 3pm to 5pm, we have a rude shock when the staff tells us the last order for the buffet is 3.30pm. It seems that there is an event tonight. The restaurant will be closing the buffet earlier in order to prepare for the event. I am annoyed that the staff should have called up to tell us about the problem so that we could come earlier. The buffet style here is quite different from outside. There is no buffet counter or menu for one to look at. One just picks whatever one likes from the various push carts going around the dining room. Within a short time, the table is easily filled up.Kueh Pie Tee, Shark's Fin Soup and Duck meat roll are part of the buffet, but is limited to one serving per customer. The kueh pie tee is not filled with the traditional vegetable filling. Instead it is filled with calamari salad. Interesting.For the steamed dim sum, there is items such as xiao long bao, siew mai, bean curd roll, steamed pork ribs, crystal bun, chive dumplings, vegetable dumpling, seafood dumplings, chee cheong fan with assorted fillings and chicken feet. The crystal bun has savoury rice filling in it. Tastes not bad.For buns, there is cha siew bun (BBQ pork bun), pan fried pork bun, black sesame bun and everyone's favourite Liu Sha Bao (\u6d41\u6c99\u5305). The Liu Sha Bao (\u6d41\u6c99\u5305) is uniquely green in color, and the filling really flowing out easily. The black sesame filling in the black sesame bun is a bit too sweet for me.For deep fried items, there is shrimp roll, shrimp dumplings, seafood balls, goyza, and fried durian shrimp roll. The fried durian shrimp roll is covered with deep fried noodle like crust, inside filled with rich and chunky filling. Although one cannot smell the durian in it, the taste is pretty strong in it and surprisely well with the juicy shrimp.Besides these, there is also fried ee fu mee, century egg porridge, lotus leaf rice, chilled pork in jelly, chilled cheek in jelly, baked pork pastry, deep fried fish skin with salted egg and black sesame paste. The deep fried fish skin with salted egg sauce is quite nice with the mayonnaise, although I wish that the salted egg sauce could be thicker. The black sesame paste is quite rich and flavourful. Too bad that is the only hot dessert available that day.For cold desserts, there is ice jelly, almond jelly, herbal jelly and mango jelly. The herbal jelly tastes quite bitter. The ice jelly is quite refreshing with a hint of tea taste.Overall the food is not bad with quite a huge range although mother feels the various is less than the usual dim sum menu. Although there is a lot of staff running around, it is quite difficult to get their attention. Besides the hot tea served on the table, one can also help oneself to the ice lemon tea and ice cubes at the counter. Yes most of the times we seem to be helping ourselves to the various things around. Even when the staff has a push cart full of desserts in front of us and we request that we would like some, the old staff answers that it is not for us, but the tables behind us. Funny especially everyone is having the buffet too. The staffs here seem to be choosy in serving customers. Although at the end of the meal, one feels like having gone through a very fierce battle. Feeling super drain out.",

I went on a weekday but I was made to understand that over the weekend, the place gets packed and there are still push carts for dim sum service. We ordered a fair bit and finished all that was placed before us :) Siew Mai is my usual \"standard setter\" for a dim Sum place and they did their quite well. And most of their item came in 3s so it it was just nice for the company that I was with. Both their fried and steams items were good. We finished off with a big bowl of steamed mushed up yam (o ni or however you spell it) and it was great! All round good experience.",

We ordered the prawn roe fried rice and it was really quite good. The different textures of prawn roe, crab meat and the vegetables created quite a stir in my mouth.We orderd the sharks head on the menu as it is quite an uncommon dish. It tasted really good but i felt really guilty for indulging in that dish with all the anti sharks fin campaign going around.The dim sum were good and overall it left me very satisfied. The prices are very reasonable and its alot cheaper than restaurants in town. I will definitely be back to sample the traditional Teochew dishes which I did not manage to taste this round.",

The Liu Sha Bow at Swatow seafood comes a close second with its gooey filling just ready to spill out in all its sweet and savory goodness. You NEED to order it if you're here. Swatow Seafood is an unassuming dim sum place away from downtown which means reasonable prices, little to no wait (we had no wait at all on a Saturday afternoon), and the charm of the old school push-cart dim sum experience. This culminates into a very satisfying brunch experience with minimal stress so you can focus on enjoying the food. I thought everything we had was good from the standard siu mais and har gows to the century egg porridge and fried shrimp rolls. And of course end the meal with afore-mentioned Liu Sha Bow. The sweet custard is nicly balanced with the saltiness of the salted egg yolk. Such a treat!They have a buffet for high tea which looked like a great deal but our meal wasn't that much either which makes Sawtow Seafood a good value, and a tasty one at that,",

Swatow Seafood serves fantastic dim sum breakfast and brunches!Located in the heartlands of Singapore, this restaurant has been around for quite some time now. While the restaurant has not been advertising aggressively nor received the hype over some other star restaurant, it has been well patronised by those in-the-know. On weekends, this place is flooded with people, especially in the morning right up to noon. If you are coming as part of a large group, it is advisable to call ahead and make a reservation.While there has been a shift towards \"high end\" dim sum, i.e. ordering your dishes off a menu, Swatow Seafood still does it the \"old fashion\" way, i.e. service via a push cart. This is a nostalgic experience not to be missed (given that there isn't many such restaurants left). In addition to the old school experience, the dim sum served here is of a high standard comparable with many fine restaurants.",

    "text": "My family went for the Swatow (which means Mountain Top in Teochew) Seafood Restaurant for the dim sum buffet. This place used to be Fortunate Restaurant and Lucky Restaurant before that.. so you can say it was a location where weddings and CNY reunion meals were held at when I was young. The only thing that remained the same were the toilet areas and those big curtains where they hide away the spare chairs and tables from public view. I remember playing hide and seek with my cousins there when I was young.. so it was really nostalgic. Anyway back to reviewing the food.. the way the dimsum buffet works is the trolley with piles of food and dimsum will be rolled away. Sounds reasonable but the problem lies with that. As this place is huge.. I personally feel that they are short handed.. so to the two dim sum trolleys that were going around.. it's like there's 30-40 tables waiting.. so sometimes when the trolley comes by.. it's nearly empty.. and the servers sometimes miss our table as we were seated in the middle. We noticed the chances of you getting your plate filled were higher if you were seated at the outside. Food came out one by one.. so we ended up spending a lot of time waiting for the trolleys to come by. Even the drinks were not properly organised.. if we didn't ask we wouldn't have known that we had to go to an area and get the drinks as the dim sum and the fried food were served by trolleys. Servings were depressing.. it's a buffet but the servers usually give us the exact headcount and said that she will come back again later if we should want a second helping since this is a buffet... but often the food runs out and we don't quite see the same food again. Food wise was so-so... I guess I only like the liu sha bao (salted egg yolk custard bun). That's about it.",

    "text": "This is a JIU LOU. Not ninth floor. It means a proper Chinese restaurant where big dinners and feasts can be held, especially for weddings.It was also the place of my childhood.Or more accurately, the restaurant that used to be there, formed parts of my childhood. The previous tenant was Xin Fu Lou, which formed memories of piping-hot dim sum pushed around in trolleys.Swatow also has dim sum, but only in the day time and we were there for dinner. \u00a0The place was all white covers and folded napkins; sitting there I had an urge to give a $120 ang bao to a man and his wife.The Braised Slice Goose Meat in Teochew Style (~$17) was very savoury, especially the sauce. However the goose portion was too small, beneath the top few slices it was all tofu.The scallops and broccoli ($20) was fresh, but the portion was even smaller. Being hungry gluttons we ordered the oyster omelette ($8) from their Teochew Porridge just in case.Their signature Deep Fried Crispy Pig Trotter (~$25) is a must-try. The skin looked dark and the meat looked dark but it was GOOD. The skin was crispy and crunchy and yet easy on the bite. You know some crispy pork skin fried too hard until it tastes bitter and has so hard a centre it feels like biting on rocks? Not this. The meat was tender and flavourful. If you can only afford one dish, THIS IS IT. (Yes their dishes are pretty expensive IMO.)The oysters in the oyster omelette were huge and easy for me to pick out (I don't eat oysters) to give to my family members. The rest of it wasn't as starchy and gooey as I'd liked.A set of tea came with our dessert to clear our throats. I voiced out loud thinking it was syrup meant to be poured over the yam paste, asking why it wasn't poured. The affable head waiter corrected me, so yes, please don't embarrass yourself like me.I must also mention that Swatow refers to the Teochew province of China, and my heritage-proud father has claimed the food at Swatow to be quite authentically Teochew.Overall I feel the food is standard fare, and is overpriced; Swatow is evidently no Xin Fu Lou. I've heard good reviews about their dim sum buffets though.",
