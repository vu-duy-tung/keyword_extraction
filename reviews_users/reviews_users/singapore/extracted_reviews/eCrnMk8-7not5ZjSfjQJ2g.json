    "text": "This restaurant should more accurately be described as a peranakan fusion restaurant. I am a peranakan and frankly have not sampled an authentic peranakan restaurant in Singapore. Since this is a fusion restaurant, I did not have high hopes, in spite of them having won a Michelin star. The restaurant decor is sparse but pleasant. Service was very attentive and really friendly. 5 stars. They had a regular menu you would expect from this type of restaurant, but with twists to the traditional recipes. \u00a0For example, the ayam buah \u00a0keluak had decent flavor but the emphasis was the chicken, whereas traditional food is the opposite. Likewise the prawn petai, flavors were there, but the emphasis was the fresh prawns, not the petai. All in all the food was decent, but not spectacular. \u00a0If you are expecting authentic peranakan, you will be disappointed. However they were true to their advertisement, fusion peranakan. A downside was the pricing, quite expensive, about $70 per person.",

The portions here are quite small so would recommend ordering 3-5 dishes for 2 people. Details of what we ordered below:- Kueh Pie Tee Shell - a classic traditional Singaporean appetizer. Executed well- Crab Curry - tastes like Thai food to me but nonetheless a terrific dish - very flavorful - the citrus taste is quite strong, which helps balance out the rich which can be quite rich- Buah Keluak fried rice - a bit bitter though I guess that's how it's supposed to be. Good dish though- Braised Chicken with Peranakan Black Nut Sambal - stewed chicken in black curry - very unique flavors - chicken is tender and the curry has a character- A bit expensive - but well worth it.Good service as expected from a restaurant in this price range.",

I enjoyed all the dishes that I ordered. My rating is based on the following:Food: 5 starsEnvironment: 4 starsService: 4.5 starsRecommendations: Wagyu beef rendangThe portion size is on the small side. I knew this before hand after reading some of the reviews and ordered two mains. \u00a0I came in hungry and easily finished a bowl of rice, the king tiger prawns, the beef rendang, and the buah keluak ice cream. 1 The wagyu beef rendang - This is the best beef rendang I have ever had. The meat was cut with a fork tender and was bursting with flavor. I highly recommend. 2King tiger prawns - The coconut sauce the prawns were served with was delicious. The prawns were cooked nicely and the shell was partially removed making it easy to eat. This dish only comes with two prawns though and feels more like a small plate than a main. \u00a03 Buah keluak ice cream - The dish looks simple in appearance but there is a lot going in here. You have a mix of temperatures (warm chocolate vs ice cream), textures (cake crumbs vs ice cream and melted chocolate) , and tastes (sweet and spice). \u00a0I would like to come back again and try the tasting menu. I didn't get to try any of small plates, soups or roasted dishes. \u00a0You should definitely check this place out. It's not cheap but it's worth it.",

It really calmed you after a stormThe nyonya Kueh selections were a delight paired with blue sweet pea blossom tea. I gave it 3.5 stars because of not getting the a la carte dish when it was our conscious decision. And not all the sauces dishes were to our palate. Kinda on the heavy flavor side. I hade to get two bowls of rice to eat the sauces dishes. The ambience is clean and comfortable. Very fusion tropical. I do recommend this place for a date if you are in Singapore",

    "text": "A chance encounter with the documentary \"Food Heros\" featuring Peranakan chef Malcolm Lee got me interested in his restaurant, Candlenut in Singapore. Here I was, a week later... and what a culinary adventure!This is not your traditional Peranakan restaurant. Candlenut features many familiar ingredients that the Straits Chinese use, but it has creatively tweaked some recipes and on occasion created something new, the Buah Keluak ice cream for one. Having a non-discriminatory palate (and an open mind) is really the best way to make the most of your experience here.We went for the cheekily named 'ah-ma-kase' set menu which came with three appetisers, soup, salad and a selection of main courses. For appetisers, we had the Smoked Octopus Acar (spicy pickle), Kurobuta Pork Satay (tender, perfectly grilled, hints of paprika, accompanied by a sweet sauce), and the exceptionally delectable Kueh Pie Tee (wafer thin crispy shells filled with tasty crabmeat, subtle hints of lemongrass).Appetisers were quickly followed by Itek Tim, a savoury-sourish duck soup. Candlenut offered an interesting twist, adding spongelike taro stem to the soup and having the duck meat served as a meatball with minced mushrooms and pickled mustard cabbage.The main courses which came in generous portions, were served communal style. Mom's Curry Prawns was my favorite - giant prawns were first lightly grilled then cooked in a delicious lemongrass candlenut curry gravy. Grilled Red Snapper (drizzled with lime juice, lemongrass-onion-chilli sauce) was another outstanding dish. Duck Curry, aromatic from various ground spices, was cooked in a rendang style with the coconut curry thick and creamy. Wok-fried Pork Slices was another winner. Saut\u00e9ed with prawn chilli sambal and shredded kaffir lime leaves, it delivered a remarkably fiery punch, punctuated by the distinctive citrusy notes of the lime leaves. Prawn Wing Bean Salad offered a refreshing light contrast to the other main dishes but as this was nearly the only greens in the set, I would have loved for it to come in a bigger serving. After a complimentary palate cleanser - lemongrass granita, we moved on to desserts. The Mao Shan Wang Durian Ice Cream was every bit as mouthwatering as its pedigree would have you anticipate. It was also a pretty scoop adorned with flowers and a rose cookie. Steamed Banana Cake was light and fluffy, pairing beautifully with the accompanying Gula Melaka ice cream. However the star in this section belonged to the Buah Keluak Ice Cream. Savoury bits of the distinctive earthly nut were mixed into the ice cream and there was also the delightful crunch of salted caramel. What a brilliant combination of flavours and textures.Traditional Peranakan cuisine will always be a part of Singapore's food culture. Notwithstanding, I applaud Candlenut's creative flair, and courage in pushing boundaries, and for its ambition to elevate Peranakan cuisine to levels of fine dining. Afterall didn't Peranakan cuisine evolve from an innovative fusion of cooking techniques and ingredients of 2 or more distinct cultures, necessitated in part by a need to adapt? Kudos, Chef Lee and his team.",

    "text": "\"Something taste like lemon Dawn\" \u00a0I whisper.\"Right?\" Whispers my dining companion through giggles.And that began what unbeknownst to me would be one of the best meals in Singapore.It just goes to show that you should not start off exploring a country's food with the most difficult to understand, and highly refined.Candlenut is a Michelin one star Peranaken restaurant in the heart of Dempsey. The food is uniquely Singaporean, the joining of Chinese and Malay food using the local ingredients.The dining space, part of a large warehouse, does not at all resemble a Michelin restaurant however, the food speaks for itself.Begin with a number of small plates. All dishes are meant to be shared. The kueh pie tee crispy shell stuffed with crab meat, seasoned with curry, and a bit of pickled shallots, almost taste of laksa. \u00a0The wing bean salad with baby radish, lemongrass, cashews in a calimansi lime dressing, the definition of texture. Extremely refreshing. Finally the crispy pork belly with pickled greens, outstanding. Think of the best Filipino lechon topped with crisp pickled veg, it's tight sour grip finishing with a gentle fermented seafood flavor. Excellent complexity.Mains crisscross the country. An excellent wagyu beef rendang, tender and extremely flavorful wrapped in a slury of cumin, turmeric, turmeric leaves, and other spices, wallops the pallet. The spice mix penetrates the meat all the way to its deep core. Not to be out done, a dish called \"Mum's Curry\" is equally deeply flavored. Tender, juicy chunks of chicken and potatoes and a deep rich curry mixture. Fresh peppers brighten the dish. Both are perfect spooned over some rice.The dish of the evening, red lion snapper simply cooked in a fresh chili sambal with charred garlic chives; incredible. The sweet flavor of the fish is accented beautifully by the fiery sambal. \u00a0A squeeze of calamansi brightens the flavor. Desserts, are also outstanding. It is hard to fault the Kueh salat with bangkit crumble and young coconut sorbet. \u00a0Hawaii yeeps, think of the best custard mochi you've ever had, add a light, refreshing, coconut supercharged sorbet and you have this dish.Service is informal and very friendly. As with most South East Asian countries, you must flag the server if you want something.Nice selection of wine however there is no better match to the food than beer considering the spice levels.Reservations required.Impressive to say the least. Save this for your final meal in the country and it will all make sense.Thank you Singapore.",

Ambience is nice... the place is done up really nicely decor-wise and it felt quite sophisticated yet traditional. There were 6 of us so we ordered a good variety of dishes to share. My favorite dish was the charcoal grilled whole squid with fresh yellow tumeric sambal - really tender and fragrant, and was complemented well with the sambal, which was very flavorful. I'd also recommend the babi pongteh (braised duroc pork cheek pongteh) which was super tender. The ayam buah keluak was tasty too though I wish they left the whole nut inside for the experience... The one thing I wished though was if the server had asked us if we wanted to have a portion of the homemade sambal belachan to try - $2 per sharing portion. I mean... yes it's on the menu, and I don't agree with having to pay for it, but the point is that they didn't even ask... and I found the food not spicy enough.. it's a peranakan restaurant after all right?Dessert was expensive and absolutely nothing to shout about. I'd give it a miss if I find myself back there. Overall, not too bad \"refined\" peranakan food but I think you can find better elsewhere for cheaper and with more character.",

I was glad to have found just one Michelin restaurant with Singaporean roots. I honestly must say, I was disappointed. Singaporean food, boasting strong flavors and rich spices, was not accurately reflected in the meal I had.The jackfruit curry was mild in flavor, without the strong spice flavors.The sambal was very tender, but the meat was quite shredded and the flavor, again, not as strong as the rich street foods we had tried.Singaporean food all should have strong enough flavors that require it to be paired with rice, but my rice bowl was still near full. Some advice for visitors: although Singapore may have the most number of Michelin Starred restaurants, if you want a local Singaporean experience, stick with the food markets and the local restaurants to truly get the Singaporean eating experience.",

    "text": "Candlenut @ DempseyGone upmarketAmbience much nicer than before.In premises shared with a Japanese restaurant, a mini Market, a bar in the centre of the premises and at the other end a French restaurant.The waitresses are no longer in kebayas. Why? Because it doesn't fit the new image.Saw the Chef walking around in a suit!Satay didn't have much of a satay sauce. It was just grilled meat. This was much better previously. They shouldn't have changed it!Crispy bean curd skin ngor hiang (minced pork, prawns & water chestnut) - not fragrant. The one at Singapura Seafood Restaurant is better.Wild caught baby squid, sambal belachan cherry tomatoes & red onions texture of squid was tender, sauce was good, cherry tomatoes good too. Overall it is tasty but a tad saltish.Tiger prawns, petai beans, tamarind & shallots - prawns don't quite look the size of tiger prawns. Candlenut's classic chendol cream, Pandan jelly & Gula Melaka - Super sweet.Food was very good before. Tonight it was only average. I would say it's okay tonight but unfortunately not worthy of its Michelin Star.",

    "text": "Can't be worse for customer service. Refused to let in customers who came 3min after 230pm as the \"kitchen had closed\". If you can have an incremental revenue, and there isn't significant incremental cost to opening the kitchen, it just boils down to inflexibility and a distinct lack of customer service and empathy. We had to make significant sacrifices to our schedule and beat the crazy Singapore traffic to just get here and then get turned away. There have been many other restaurants that have been many times more accommodating. Well, it is the first time I am here and it will probably be the last time that I am. Even though I never ever got a chance to taste the food, it has left me a strong and nasty taste.",

While the dining area is a little haphazard, there is a weird charm to it. We ate here before and after the star, and tried both omakase menu and ala carte items. The dishes are always on point. Waitstaff and cheerful and pleasant. Needless to say, we will be back.",

    "text": "The decor was rustic with straw lamp shades. Fast service. We had starters with satay, stewed vegetables that you scooped into fried pastry cups and prawn crackers. Then mains with steaming hot rice, beef rendang coconut strength, vegetables in mild spicy sauce and coconut water from the shell. Good service with older waiting staff. KK had the chendol or green jelly with coconut. The flavors smacked of Singapore in the 21st century. The charm of old Melaka in the food was cloaked by the modern Sporean fog.",

The food wasn't especially tasty there, even the garnish was so common that from nowhere I could tell this is a one star Michelin restaurent. Portion was small. The environment itself was ok but not as good as expected. Not sure about Singapore but with this price I would expect something nicer and more grand. Overall, wouldn't recommend this place.",

    "text": "Bad attitude Reservation Lady. Zero service. Our first time to this place. Walking into Candlenut, the place has a great ambience which makes you feel like you will be having a good night and great food. Was looking forward to it. The problem is the ATTITUDE of the Reservation Lady. We booked a week before and she said couldn't find our name. Arrogance And Pompous ATTITUDE not to mention slowness and lack of response No APOLOGY And ARGUMENTATIVE. And all these was played out in front of the kids. It was so embarrassing. With the hype on this place, being a one Michelin , we had our expectations heighten too but it is intolerable not to have someone who understands customer relationship management. This was supposed to be a special night out but she messed it up.",
