Even the chairs get dressed up with Santa hats!Great selection of Beer (try the Green Monster Beer!), Great Band, Great Ambience (but it can get a little loud at times when they raise the volume of the music). Great place to celebrate friend's birthday, you can order dessert and get the staff to personalize the plate with the word \"Happy Birthday\", you can also dedicate birthday song via the band.",

But last Friday, 3 of us met there around 6:30pm. We sat outside near the water feature...I hadn't been back in about 6 months. I noticed how old and tired the place was looking. Nothing has changed outside in 3 years. If anything, service to the outdoor area has gone backwards since the closure of the outside serving station. Beers came in a good order from the inside bar, but the pizzas took an eternity from the kitchen. The Parma ham pizza was passable, but the meat lovers pizza was epically horrible...cardboard base with tomato sauce, topped with ground beef and BBQ sauce drizzled on top with unidentifiable cheese globbed here and there. A sicky sweet awful conglomeration...No pepperoni, no salami, no onions, no herbs...nothing. Avoid eating pizzas here at all costs. And please, spend some money on the outdoor area. Would have given just 1 star for the beers, but credit to staff that the toilets are clean and well serviced.",

RedDot brews their own brand of beers, with a taste test available so do test out before you get it, as we were recommended a sweet beer with passion fruit notes, but after tasting I was thankful I didn't get stuck with it in the end. One unfortunate thing that happened, as we were sitting beneath the trees, some gross unidentifiable semi-liquid stuff fell on my friend which kind of dampened the experience there, but this is probably and hopefully an unfortunate isolated case.",

    "text": "Much like the bigger red dot we're all living on, how much you like Reddot Brewhouse really depends on what you're expecting and what you're looking for.Don't expect: amazing fancy complex beers, or excellent service, or delicious satisfying mains.The service in particular, can be absolutely atrocious on some days. \u00a0Nope. Don't expect any of that.Instead, expect what you'd expect of a casual pub with a good band.Affordable, good (but not amazing) beer. Some interesting brews, and generally it all goes down easy.Great bar snacks and finger food. Their spicy wings pack a REAL KICK so don't go in cocky. The wedges and other snacks and eats are all perfectly decent. Nothing inedible, nothing gross. I found their Vongole HORRIBLE though, so I'd definitely give that a miss. Previous experiences have established that their other mains are also 'just decent', so generally I recommend eating dinner somewhere else first (and there are so, so many options in the Dempsey area so there's no excuse) and then going to chill out and have beers at Reddot after.The live bands they bring in are alright too. While not always the best singers in the place, they always work hard to engage the crowd, have little gameshow type things, (we won a free beer tower!), and generally really help up the fun factor.So like I said at the start. Don't go to Reddot looking to be disappointed. Go with low expectations, a high threshold for beer, and with friends you want to laugh with. That's the secret sauce.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner early on a Saturday evening. Our party of 4 didn't have a reservation, but luckily we were able to get seated right away.The menu has a good variety of pub grub and pastas, with average prices for Dempsey Hill. I wanted to order a pizza but apparently it wasn't available. I think the waitress mentioned something about pizzas only being served later in the evening? Either way, I was peeved about that, so I ended up not ordering. My husband ordered a seafood pasta of sorts and it was alright, nothing to Yelp about. Our friend's date got the fish and chips, and it also looked decent.However, the service was good, as the place was packed but I don't remember any long waits. Also, they were nice enough to let us move to the smoking area on the patio after the staff dried everything off (I don't know why they weren't prepared for the daily rainstorms we have!)What I really enjoyed was the live music. The first act of the evening was pretty good, 2 guys doing an acoustic act, singing an alternative music set. However, I really liked the second act- a man and woman who just sang with a keyboard. They sounded amazing! Loved their focus on top 40 hits.Overall, not a place to go out of your way for, but good spot for casually hanging out with friends or starting the night out. Also, the only place I know where you can have green beer year round, as opposed to only on St. Paddy's day. :)",
