We've lived in San Diego and constantly miss Mexican. \u00a0This is one of the cheaper Mexican places we've found, and it \"kind of\" hits the spot.The guacamole is a great deal and the chips are freshly fried. The steak was tender and juicy, and a good deal for the price, but it's not \"Mexican\". We also got the burrito, and the shredded beef is authentic. But they didn't add sour cream and guacamole.What I wish they had was a Super Burrito -- the burritos where you can get meat, beans, rice, salsa, sour cream, cheese, guacamole all rolled in a big burrito. \u00a0They don't have that here -- it's a different kind of Mexican. Prices are inexpensive for what you're getting -- we will definitely be going back.",

The Quesadilla's, Nachos and Ceviche are great, but not sure about the rest of the menu.What IS amazing though, are the different kind of Margaritas they have. Shaken or blended, both are great. They also sell them in pitchers, and aren't stingy with the tequila. Share a jug between two people and it's quite enough to make you happy campers if you aren't eating anything.What I like about this place is the quirky decor and also the ambience it has. It's a great place to hang out with friends to have a few beverages and just chill out. It's always busy on Friday nights and weekends so if you are planning on catching up with friends, do make reservations. Overall, a great place to chill out with friends.",

I love the weird decor of the place. The casual sitting/standing along the alley and the wonderful friends I have made from just standing around watching random musicians. I love that people sometimes spontaneously burst into song and dance as they walk by (true story, and happens quite often) because the vibe at Piedra Negra (at least on the outside) is so energetic and contagious.A typical Friday or Saturday night for me would be a couple of drinks (on the street, yes) at Piedra Negra, then walking down the street to Om for other types of awesome experiences and people. It's hard to explain. But I do love it.",

Probably the best nachos I've had in Singapore so far.But beyond that... there's not much else. The rest of the menu is quite standard, Quesadilla's and such, which to be honest, do not taste that great.I hear the ceviche is also quite good but I've never tried it myself.The decor however is quite unique, both inside and out. The graffiti-esque art outside is unlike anything else in the Arab Street area and makes the perfect entrance to the hipstery Haji Lane. To add to it, the street is adorned with surprisingly talented musicians on a weekend night to set the mood.Go there for the nachos, stay for the atmosphere.",

    "text": "This is a Mexican restaurant amid Bugis' Arab street. It is quite large overall, with two separate indoor and outdoor seating areas. The indoor ones have only a few tables. Also, the staff will warn you that alcohol can only be served outside and not inside. This mysterioso rule is sure to be the highlight of dinnertime conversation, as you puzzle over its true meaning. Arrive early if you want a table. This is the sort of place that likes to mark everything \"reserved\" at opening, even if a reservation is for 10pm and they could serve 50 guests at that table in the meantime. The service leaves much to be desired. You really have to grab people to get what you need. The disjointed indoor and outdoor areas contribute to the sloppiness, since servers are running in and out and about. The best part is the food. We tried the queso fondido, which comes as Spanish chorizo chunks in a red sauce with cheese baked over top. It is served in a cast iron skillet with tortillas on the side. I recommend it as a shared appetizer, especially if you like cheese. Tortilla chips would be a good compliment if you desire a crunch. Alas, they do not serve complimentary chips and salsa like all Mexican restaurants should. Moreover, you can't order it from the menu since they only have pico de gallo. However, since salsas are on some of the dishes, I suspect you could place a special order for it (assuming you can get the attention and understanding of the staff). For a main, I tried the beef enchiladas. They come on a huge plate (3 pieces) with a moat of salsa verde around the sides and slightly browned cheese atop. The meat inside is in the style of pulled pork, even though it's beef. The cheese and salsa verde were excellent. I recommend this for a main course. The mains are likely big enough for two to share in many cases.",

Nothing comparable to Mexican in California or TexMex in Chevys. After living in Singapore for the past three years, my expectations were LOW. Their baja fish taco tasted like sandpaper. The batter used to fry the fish was too thick and the fish was not fresh.As a prime establishment in Arab St., Piedra Negra simply needs to do better.

    "text": "A massive building with multiple entrances, practically spanning the whole block between Haji Lane, Bali Lane, Beach Rd. and the alley that becomes Baghdad St. No way to miss it, just look for people taking selfies beside a kitsch \"Mayan\" mural on Haji Lane.Having read the menu before, our expectations were very high. When we eventually visited Piedra Negra, my wife and I had a more than decent guacamole to start. We tried the lentil soup which is fabulous, tasty, simple and with a certain home-made quality. Our expectations went higher. While Diana had some really good chicken enchiladas made with a very hot and tasty green sauce, I asked for a lamb mixiote which turned out to be quite disappointing (expectations crashing down here). I need to explain: mixiotes are meat stews wrapped in the outer skin of maguey (century plant) leaves, or in aluminium foil or baking paper. The fact that I was given a stew inside a cute iron pot instead of wrapped in paper \u00a0means our pals at Piedra Negra don't understand what the dish is about. To be fair, the stew itself was delicious with the soft lamb melting in my mouth, worthy of a good Irish or Czech restaurant.The drinks menu has a decent assortment of tequilas, and a few Mexican beers, served with lime wedges just like everywhere, except in M\u00e9xico. They have a single brand of mezcal, but it's the good stuff (I even got the worm for myself). Piedra Negra is a fun, lively place with salsa music, tasty food and a colourful, albeit kitsch environment. It's a pity they sell themselves as a Mexican restaurant. The fact that they put so much effort in looking Mexican rather than cooking Mexican ends up reinforcing stereotypes, instead of undermining them.Curious fact: the Mexican Embassy, ironically, is across the street.",

Although it was a very busy night we were seated quickly. Staff very attentive through the evening. * star- Restaurant: Art, art, art. cool Mexican murals cover the walls inside and outside. Reminds me of Lucky Street in San Francisco's Mission Dist. \u00a0lots of different seating options...Out, in, in-between. Bar, restaurant...etc. it's all good.* star- Location: cool area, a cool \"scene\" Just really great for people watching. *star- good South of the Cali border drink menu...I had Awesome Margaritas.

    "text": "In Texas after a fun night of drinking and bar hopping, one usually stops at Taco Bell for \"fourth meal.\" Unfortunately, Singapore does not have Taco Bell, but they do have Piedra Negra. We were out last night and before grabbing our cab to go home, we stopped at Piedra Negra. We got a table outside. Our waitress was prompt and friendly. My husband and I split a beef burrito which came with delicious waffle fries. Our friends split nachos. Now can you really compare it to Texas Tex Mex or California Mexican food? Probably not, but you are in Singapore. Honestly, we thought it was delicious, the prices were reasonable and we'll be back!",

    "text": "Came here yesterday for Cinco De Mayo, only to find out they celebrated it on Saturday. Cinco De Mayo literally translates to 5th of May. Disappointing and weird.So there's that. But let's continue...Ambiance: Awesome! They really went out of their way to make this place jazzy, the result is quite fun. Service: Asked 3 times for chips and salsa. They came back and repeated our order twice (he didn't write it down and kept forgetting). Then 30 min later someone came to tell us they were out of one of the two items we ordered. Then they charged us twice for the same item. I also noticed the tables around us were getting up and going to the bar when they needed someone, as the servers were either absent or had forgotten.Safe to say the service is pretty bad.Food: Guac is a very small portion for $10, they prepare it at your table so we saw that they use only one avocado, a shot glass of tomatoes, onions, jalape\u00f1os and cilantro (WAY too much for just one avocado) and lime juice----missing much needed SALT! The burritos were good, very small compared to a burrito you would get in Mexico or the states, but tasty enough. Though they forgot to add beans. And for the price, it's hard to complain too much (much cheeper than Baja Fresh). In conclusion, I would order food for takeaway, or possibly come back when I had an hour to wait for my food. Otherwise, you can get more authentic Mexican at Baja Fresh for a bit more money. No joke.",

    "text": "I heard great things about this Mexican restaurant's authenticity, but if this is authentic Mexican food, I am really not a fan. \u00a0The food is at best average. I must say, however, that the Strawberry Margherita was delicious and that proved to be the highlight of our meal. It came in a generously sized jug that could be shared amongst many. There are better Mexican spots out there, but if you insist on visiting (because, well, the location is great, and I did love the quirky decorative elements like the skeleton dolls), take note to avoid sitting by the main road. The sounds of traffic will compete with, and beat, whatever conversation you are attempting to have, and there are stagnant smells coming from the drains. Instead, walk down the small alley and try to get a table at the back.",

    "text": "Great location in Haji Lane and after several visits to the area and eating elsewhere, we decided to give this a try. Mexican food in Singapore is a bit hit or miss, so we were not sure what to expect. \u00a0After our visit, I would say this veers more towards a miss. Chips and Guacamole were OK. It was made up at the table with a little too much lime and the portion size was a little on the small side. The main courses did try to be a little different from the norm, but were really just not that tasty. Dessert was probably the highlight, with the Corn Cake being very good. All in all, this is a cool place to go for drinks, with the Margaritas being especially notable, but for good Mexican food, try elsewhere.",

    "text": "There are not many Mexican restaurants in Singapore (only 2 that I know of) and as a fan of Tex-Mex, I was thrilled to find this gem of a place at the end of Haji Lane. The murals are in your face - very artistic, and the establishments boasts a cool band that plays Mexican classics and traditional songs.What I Love: The ambiance, the food and drinks are great. The food is authentic, and portions are pretty okay. They could be bigger though. But comparing it to American portions may not be fair either. The margaritas are my fave - and getting a a whole pitcher is more affordable. The Burrito, Nachos and Tapas are sure bets. MUST HAVE: The Salmon-Avacado Ceviche salad served in a big martini glass. Yummmmmmm.What I Don't Love: The prices. The prices are pretty steep.... Drinks and 2 mains, plus 2 starters will set you back $100, at least.",

    "text": "I had seen this place several times in passing but had never ventured in so when a friend suggested meeting here for dinner and drinks I decided it was a good time to try it out. I was wrong. When we arrived it had already gotten busy and we were placed in a table in the alley. We had a large group (7 in total) and were all huddled around one table. There was so little room some members of our group had to place their plates in their lap to eat. There was a large open table close to the restaurant but we were told it was reserved. They held that table open for over an hour (no exaggeration) while we were left to dodge cars driving through the alley and eat out of our laps. The food was also nothing spectacular. My chicken quesadilla was decent but the thing they called a taco was more like an oversized taquito. It was a tortilla stuffed with meat and then rolled up and fried. It tasted okay but was not what we were expecting. The bright spot of the experience were the margaritas. We had a pitcher of strawberry and a pitcher of the original and they were both very tasty.The service staff was definitely overwhelmed; the restaurant is large and it was completely full. It did not seem like there were enough people working to adequately cover the needs of the restaurant and they were disorganized. All in all, next time I find myself wandering Haji lane and see this place, I will keep walking.",
