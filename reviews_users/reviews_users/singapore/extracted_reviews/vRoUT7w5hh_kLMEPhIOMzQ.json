    "text": "My mother and my best friend love crabs, so very often I end up eating with my mother, my best friend, and her husband at places that specialise or feature crabs.JUMBO. More recently, Happy Crab. And this actually was the meal that inspired me to bring my best friend to Happy Crab... because this place really let us down.We had high hopes because I had heard good things... so when we arrived we discovered they had a buy three get one free offer. DING. Four of us. FOUR CRABS. Done.Chilli. Pepper. Fresh steamed. And Bee hoon soup. We had all four of their preparation styles. We also had their chili marinated top shell starter that was SUPER GENEROUS in terms of portion size, and a nice, spicy starter. Only I had to eat most of it because top shell wasn't too popular with the rest of the people at the table. A single portion shared amongst 6-8 people would be ideal though. It'd really whet your appetite.The crabs. Now the bee hoon soup was... average, the fresh steamed incredibly unmemorable, the chili a bit too sweet, but the pepper was quite delicious. Not quite Eng Seng at Joo Chiat level, but good. Why was it so disappointing though?a) Temperature: some of the crab pieces were actually a little cold. It seemed like all the crabs had been pre-cooked and then they're reheated and tossed in whichever sauce you order it in. b) Freshness: the crabs didn't come across as very fresh. The flesh had that slightly mushy, waterlogged texture that comes from freezing, and it was especially noticeable in the legs where the meat was really almost unpleasant. One of the crabs we had, I think the steamed one, also had a rather unpleasant smell of... ammonia. It tasted okay, still sweet, and a little mushy, but it smelled really unpleasant.Overall, the value was okay, but when I eat crabs, it's all about freshness. I'm sticking to Happy Crab at Pahang Street.yelp.com.sg/biz/happy-cr\u2026At least there the crabs are super fresh.",

    "text": "Came here twice in a week! It's a good chili crab place that's clean and has AC! The staff is really nice and helpful as well. Prices are about average from what I've seen in Singapore, S$50 per crab. They have other flavors besides the famous red chili crab. They have side dishes as well, which seemed a bit over price to me. We tried the tofu fries - which came with a spicy chili dipping sauce, it was alright! I would definitely just focus on the crab. It depends on hungry you are, but it seems like one crab per person is the norm if that's going to be your main meal. Butter crab was a bit bland (so good for those who can't handle the heat), and pepper crab (the OG Momma Kong's crab) was too peppery (?). The red chili crab still my favorite, sweet, savory, and spicy. **TIP: try the steamed mantou buns. They're super soft and fluffy, and helps to soak up all the delicious crab roe and gravy.",

    "text": "When in Singapore you MUST get crab. Well, unless you're deathly allergic, then maybe not. But for everyone else, Chili Crab is a must. I was told a story that Singapore is green because it apparently looks like a crab and a brown crab is an unhealthy crab so they decided to plant many trees to make it a green crab. It's alive!I think I missed some of the parts to that story, but nevertheless, crab is a really important part of Singapore for all tourists. It's not too hard to find places that serve Chili Crab and they're usually swarming with tourists. Crab is also super expensive but I figured it was worth the splurge as long as I could get a review out of the trip.I decided to go to Mama Kong's because it was recommended to me by a Singaporean friend. I had tried to go last year and was turned away because I didn't have a reservation. I wasn't about to make the same mistake this time and booked a reservation for 5pm -- table for one!The restaurant is small with seating both indoors and outdoors, It's a clean, sit down restaurant with a cozy vibe. Very different from the Chili Crab places about a block away. Reservations were made online and they have a rewards program, but since I don't live here I didn't sign up. I had had Chili Crab before at a tourist trap and it was awesome so I was expecting good things.The Black Pepper crab is \"The Original\" crab that is most recommended here. I was told it was spicy so I decided to get the classic Red Chilli (spelling it how it's spelled on the menu) instead. It's advertised as your basic Chili Crab, but Mama Kong's style. Both crabs were priced at $50 ($36.67 USD), so it didn't make a difference in terms of budget. Again, crab is always expensive in Singapore. It's probably possible to find cheaper crab, though.I was parched and got an apple juice, as well. It was $6 ($4.40 USD) and it literally tasted like apple juice, so I wouldn't say this was special by any means. It was definitely over priced but whatever, I needed something to drink and Mama Kong's didn't have a special drink that I was dying to try.The apple juice came first, followed by the Chili Crab shortly after. The crab was huge and I also ordered Fried Mantou for $3 ($2.20 USD) which is commonly served with Chili Crab. The Fried Mantou were so good! They were a bit heavy for me so I didn't eat all of them, but while they may have been unhealthy, they were also very delicious. I dipped the bread into the Chili sauce and enjoyed.The crab came pre-cracked. They have a de-shelling service but I didn't need it. I made piles of crab meat on the small plate they provided. I then put the meat onto the big spoon and scooped some Chili Sauce. The crab meat was juicy and there was a decent amount. The Chili sauce was sweet with a strong kick. I don't like spice so it was borderline too much for me, but I was pretty happy overall. It didn't go too well with the apple juice, though. Next time, I'll opt for a water.The restaurant was pretty empty while I was there but it's probably because I got there so early. The waiters asked to take a photo of me and gave me a copy with my check. The service was good and every one was super nice.I think Mama Kong's is a great place to go if you're looking for Chili Crab and you want a nice, cozy ambience. However, the actual quality of the crab was similar to that of the crab I've had a tourist traps and the crab overall was a bit too pricey for what it was. Plus, the $6 apple juice really threw me off.TOTAL COST: $70.05 ($51.38 USD)34 Mosque StSingaporeThis review is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews.",

This was so delicious in every aspect. The crab was giant, and the sweetness of the meat was still there... even with the excessive chili sauce. The sauce was thick, and perfectly seasoned. I literally mopped up every drop of sauce with those delicious fried buns.Tofu Chips/Fries - not sure what compelled me to order these. I'm not a big fan of tofu on its own. But fried, they sounded interesting. The server also recommended them stating they were popular. I wasn't impressed. They weren't at all crunchy on the outside. It was just deep fried, spongy, tofu sticks. Soggy outside, spongy inside. Very bland.The service was kind of eh... we were rushed from the second we walked in. They greeted us, and informed us that a large reserved party was due to arrive within the hour. They were only willing to seat us if we could finish in under an hour... why didn't they just lock the doors and wait for that large party then?...",

    "text": "What to do in Singapore if not eating their famous chili crab? We tried to find a place that is far from the limelights but still do good chili crab, and the answer was right there in our own neighborhood ( we stayed in Chinatown ). Momma Kong's was just a few walks away from our hotel and it looked pretty decent joint, a small-ish one but with good reviews, so we went in. We didn't take the package (you should if you're a big eater, we found out later that the package for two people is really good deal), but we ordered one crab each, the black pepper and the chili one and a set of steamed mantou to wipe all those delicious crab broth away.The crabs were super delicious and we were super happy. I had problems with cracking the claws but the staff spotted it right away and helped with it. My boyfriend who never had such large crab experience before also dove right in without any problem. My chili crab was perfect with the perfect amount of burn and the black pepper was super delicious. The bill came at around 75 dollars or so, so it was almost the same price with the package ( I believe the package is without drinks, and alcohol is quite pricey in Singapore) and we had beers, so if you think you can eat a lot, go for the package.I would definitely go back to this place if I had time next time. I am still thinking about the chili crab these days....and do book a table online, they can be a bit busy!",

    "text": "My wife and I visited Singapore for the first time after Christmas, following a trip to the Philippines to attend a major family event, and we made it a point to sample some of Singapore's signature dishes. We tried Hainanese Chicken Rice our first night and Fish Head Curry from Banana Leaf Apolo the following day. For our last full day in Singapore, we headed out to Chinatown to try Chili Crab at Momma Kong's.Our initial research pointed to No Signboard Seafood as the place to get chili crab. However, recent reviews of No Signboard Seafood point to a decline in dining experience so we decided to give Momma Kong's a try.Reservations are highly recommended as the place was quite popular and cozy, with indoor and limited outdoor seating. Even in late December, it was hot and humid in Singapore and indoor seating with AC is preferable. We made a reservation for 2 for 5:00 PM, right when they open. They must get busy since we were informed they have a 7:00 PM reservation for the same table and they hoped we would be done by then. I was a bit put off by that but I knew we would not be lingering that long so no harm no foul.I ordered the red chili crab (Sri Lankan mud crab fresh flown daily - at least that's their claim) with jasmine rice. My wife, a self-proclaimed \"lazy eater\" opted for the prawn fried rice. For starters we shared the fried tofu chips with a zesty tomato-based dipping sauce. To round out our order, we ordered fried mantou and a couple of refreshing calamansi juices (on the menu as lime juice).The chili crab was the unquestioned highlight of our dinner...and it got messy. The chili gravy wasn't spicy and even had a hint of sweetness. The crab was fresh and I had to work to extract the meat...for the both of us. They can de-shell the crab for a fee ($15?)...but where's the fun in that? Needless to say, I used multiple napkins (so rare to find napkins in restaurants in Singapore) during dinner. The prawn fried rice was good as well as were the fried mantous. The fried tofu chips were also a hit. Based on food alone, we were inclined to give this place 5 stars. However, I rate on the entire dining experience.So what were the negatives? For starters, we didn't ask for but we were served these coated peanuts. They were OK...nothing special. We thought they were complimentary only to find out we were charged $2 SGD (Singapore Dollars) for them. We also used the wet napkins on the table (of course...this was a crab place and it gets messy)...and was charged $0.60 SGD for them. Oh yeah, we also found out they added a 10% Service Charge for a dinner for 2! I just can't help but feel like we were being nickeled and dimed for what already was a relatively expensive meal...just took away from the experience.Dinner for 2 came out to just under $108 SGD...or about $75 (US) in \"real\" money.",

Momma Kong's might not have the \"authentic\" feel of No Signboard in Geylang or the history of Longbeach but their service is great, the staff is super friendly so it means that I don't have to deal with the grumpy, non-English speaking, \"I don't wanna serve filipino helpers\" auntie to enjoy my crab fix.The crab dishes are on par or even better than the previously mentioned restaurants and I love their mantou, they must have the prettiest and fluffiest mantou of all.Except for the chili crab, I've tried also tried the crab beehoon & pepper crab which are all good but my favorite is the steamed crab: this fantastic dish displays the freshness and glory of crab in all it's simplicity. Yes, simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication!Highly recommended!**Additional bonus points are granted for the fact that they offer to de-shell your crab (for 15$ a pop) so little bananas like me don't need to get their fingers dirty.",

Lonely Planet actually recommended this place and it wasn't too far from where I was staying in Chinatown. This restaurant also has a new modern look to it, compared to some of the other places on the same street. And the staff is really young. I was seated outside (which was disappointing cuz it's hot outside and there are mosquitos!), but I didn't have a reservation and they recommend that you do that in advance. They offer a lot on the menu - not just crab, but stingray and other plates as well. I ordered the chilli crab cuz that's what I came for. I added on the steamed mantou too, since everybody recommended getting that to dip into the chilli sauce. The crab was delicious! Some of the tastiest crab I've ever had. And the sauce was really good. It was spicy and had a nice kick to it, but it wasn't overly spicy. Really good flavor. They provide you with a crab cracker tool, a little bucket, a little silver stick to help you scoop out more meat, and a moist towelette. All the things you could possibly need. More towelettes and napkins would've been nice though (I had to dig into my own supply; bring your own moist towelettes/wet tissues with you if you can! Eating chilli crab is messy!). They also charged for the moist towelette. And they charged me for the little fish side dish they gave me, which I hardly touched. Overall, delicious chilli crab! Yum!",

    "text": "A trip to Singapore feels incomplete without having chilli crab. \u00a0Most of the restaurants were busy with Chinese New Year in full swing so glad my friend was able to make a reservation at Momma Kong's. \u00a0For four of us, we ordered the 2 person set menu with black pepper and chilli crab with an additional side of tofu chips and crab congee. \u00a0It was most than enough for the 4 of us. \u00a0I thought we'd have to get a crab per person but they are so meaty that it really does fill you up especially with the sides. \u00a0The chilli crab was delicious! \u00a0I don't have too many other places I can compare it to but I really enjoyed it. \u00a0The black pepper crab was definitely much spicier than the chilli crab but really good as well. \u00a0I really enjoyed the grilled squid and the tofu chips were surprisingly good. \u00a0I tried a bit of the crab congee and it was good. \u00a0I prefer my congee to be a bit more on the bland side but that's more of personal preference as I usually have that when I'm not feeling too well. \u00a0When our food arrived, they took a photo of us - I think it was going on instagram but thought it was nice that they printed it for us and gave it to us when the check arrived. \u00a0As a tourist, I really appreciated this!",

    "text": "My first and only Singaporean chili crab experience in Singapore and I'm sure glad it was here!This place is quite popular and always has a wait so it's best to make a reservation in advance. We requested to be seated indoors as outside seating was on a patio sidewalk and I wasn't about to endure the hot humid weather while eating this spicy meal.Our order included the crab, bread, and a scallop appetizer. I'd skip on the scallop and bacon appetizer as it wasn't a great combo. Bacon is usually good on anything, just not on scallops. The bread was nothing like I had before! It had a crispy twisted exterior but when you break it open, steam releases and visible is this soft cloud-like fluff! Whoa, I didn't see that one coming! On to the crab, it's not a huge one but the winner is the curry. The spice is really well balanced with the egg mixture and is manageable even for those who can't handle too much kick.This may be the beginning of a chili crab addiction..",

    "text": "Momma Kongs serves delicious chili crab for people who prefer to avoid giants to the likes of Jumbo seafood. Food quality is good, and setting very clean. They also take reservations and come around to take a photo for every table--including a complimentary \u00a0printout on your way out (a nice touch) Prices here are not cheap, yet I felt there were areas I was under served. For example, MK does not offer bibs for guests, a crucial element as we are expected to peel our own crabs. For you to get it peeled, MK charges $15 extra per crab.",

    "text": "I enjoy a good dining experience and who I can only presume was the owner or manager of Moma Kongs delivered this, he had a really people personality too him when taking our order, ensuring he got photos of all the diners for his patrons for his ever growing marque, etc.Staying in China town and wanting to enjoy chili crab a simple still away this seemed out best choice, best of all they took booking which made it the top of my list.We had the three crab offering a big task for two people, we chose the chili and black pepper and were recommended the butter to even out the flavors; best of all for us tourists they offered de-shelling service at a small(ish) extra so I could concentrate on eating an enjoying (sorry to any purists out there)It went without saying that I found all the crabs enjoyable though I do not profess to be an expert at these things... The drinks menu was sufficiently stocked for a cantina style restaurant.As you can tell I would recommend. This to other tourists like myself who want a simple and approachable way to enjoy one of Singapore's most famous dishes!",

It's a small restaurant not great for large groups but I'd definitely recommended over more expensive places like jumbo for small groups of 2-4 people. We went twice in the week we were there",

PARTING THOUGHT: bring a trio and order the special: 3 crabs (any style) for $118",

    "text": "Came here with foodie sister after her recommendations. Ordered bee hoon crab and decided to try something different with peranakan crab this time. Added a stingray and shanghai greens. Originally ordered a dou miao too but ad they totally forgot to place our second order, we decided to skip that. My sis, mum and bro in law have been here a couple times and raved about the bee hoon crab and butter crab. According to them the chilli crab which was supposed to be their best seller was so so. They had a not so great experience with sotong last time so decided to give the stingray a try this time. The bee hoon crab was cooked with bee hoon soup. Soup broth was milky and sweet. Very delicious. Crab was very fresh. Peranakan crab was so so. Found the sauce to be aromatic but lacking in taste and a tad too oily. Crab tastes great. Fried mantou was very good but slighlty oily. Stingray was bad. Tasted like they steamed or boiled the stingray first and just grilled it a little in oven with leaf and chilli. The sambal was also very weak in taste. Worst sting ray i ever had. Stingray had a fishy smell. My bil who had blocked nose was only one who could eat it. Shanghai greens was meh. Totally meh. Just fried with garlic and not enough salt. Conclusion: they are only good with their crabs. And honestly quite upset with their service as they missed out part 2 of our order which is the peranakan crab and veg and barely an apology.",

    "text": "I would say: it's crap.The only reason we stopped here was to have a quick drink and perhaps a quick snack. We opted for the fried chicken chunks and fried calamari, not such an adventurous choice I admit. The tonic water I ordered came garnished with a nice stick of cucumber (as often seen in Gin and Tonic). I nibbled on that one first only vaguely registering something odd. The I began to sip the drink and I realised it actually was a Gin and Tonic, even though I can still hear the waiter say: 'one tonic water'. Quickly fixed. No hassle later with the check. The crispy chicken chunks weren't very crispy nor very chunky. They were actually not nice at all!When we ordered I thought the calamari wouldn't be nice but it turned out those actually were nice. More like thin and crispy \u00a0tempura than a thick layer of tasteless batter. I realise this place specialised in crab (which I haven't tasted here), but I was not very pleased with their other offerings.",
