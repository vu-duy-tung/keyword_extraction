The wait staff was attentive and quick and the manager gave a friendly hello. Singapore's most signature cuisine is showcased in tasty renditions of flavorful dishes.",

    "text": "Violet Oon is a hometown proud celebrity chef and National Kitchen is her dedicated exhibit within the National Gallery to Peranakan Food. Everything here is slightly more upscale in its decor, and food preparation, so you'll find a $20 Hainanese Chicken Rice among other popular dishes priced upwards. The cocktails are good too.I suppose in keeping with both its upscale nature and its Singaporean hospitality, my crummily dressed self was seated in a far back corner behind the bar unseen by the top echelon of Singapore's diners. It also meant that service was slightly subpar as being in the dark corner made getting waiter attention difficult. Nonetheless I was in it for the food and it was fairly delicious. I started with a meaty duck soup. This was followed by a Malaysian spicy noodle dish that was actually made with Spaghetti pasta, and the \"starter\" was brought last, an oversized plate of turmeric chicken wings that had good flavour to them and again very sizable and meaty. I would save this place for a special occasion, but having preceded a visit here with a visit to the Peranakan Museum it seemed a suitable way to end the day.",

    "text": "There are two words that should describe this place: Dry Laksa. The preparation of this Singaporean staple is simply phenomenal, with a burst of many unbelievable flavors that have spice, tanginess and light sweetness of the coconut, all of which merge to create a dish with an unbelievable flavor profile. Admittedly, I will not call myself a Laksa expert as I was in Singapore quite briefly, but I do know a mouthwatering preparation of a dish when I try one. This is an absolute must.The establishment as a very beautiful interior and is located in the National Gallery, thus there is a museum like feel to the entire establishment. It is grand and beautiful, but dishes are priced very fairly and not over the top as many restaurants in Singapore would be with this type of ambiance. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive, giving great recommendations from the menu to help newbies into Singapore food scene get oriented quickly.I really enjoyed the Singapore sling here as well. The cocktail was made with great proportions and was a perfect refreshment for a warm summer evening. It's unique flavor and festive appearance can serve as a complementing detail to an otherwise very grand environment.Aside from the Dry Laksa, tried a couple more dishes and was very impressed. Tau Hu Goreng - fried bean curd with cucumber and bean sprouts, topped with peanut sauce. Interesting dish, despite its simplicity, but can't say it was to my flavor profile personally. Kayu Pie Tee - fried rolls with bamboo, quite delicious and unique. A flavor unlike anything one would experience in the western world.There is no wonder that this restaurant sits in the Michelin Guide for Singapore, it is a phenomenal combination of elegance, authenticity and reasonable pricing.",

    "text": "Violet Oon is a renowned chef in Singapore specializing in Peranakan cuisine which blends Chinese dishes with Southeast Asian spices and cooking techniques. \u00a0The cuisine has a large base in Malay food, such as the rending, and coconut milk is a major ingredient in many entrees. \u00a0Dishes from Northern Malaysia have more of a Thai influence, while those from Malacca and Singapore carry more of an Indonesian influence.This cuisine is the finest of Asian fusion.TURMERIC CHICKEN WINGS: \u00a0A plant of the ginger family which is prominent in Indian and SE Asian cuisines, this deep orange color powder is an essential ingredient of curries. \u00a0By itself, it has a very distinct aroma and flavor which is peppery and slightly bitter. \u00a0Coated in a thin layer of turmeric batter with a hint of lemongrass and deep fried to perfection, these wings were some of the best that I've ever had.BEEF RENDANG: \u00a0This SE Asian rendition of a beef stew was packed with explosive flavors and was served in a rich and spicy hot creamy coconut sauce. \u00a0The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender. \u00a0The sauce carried just the prefect level of heat for me - slightly burning hot but not overwhelming. \u00a0I think the coconut milk had a soothing effect and made the heat more enjoyable. \u00a0Spoon a healthy portion over steamed rice and enjoy this foodie's dream come true.DRY LAKSA: \u00a0Laksa is a rice noodle shaped almost like spaghetti and is often served with soup, just like Chinese noodle soups. \u00a0The \"dry\" version, however, was soupless but was instead saut\u00e9ed in a delicious house gravy. \u00a0This dish also carried robust and explosive flavors that were stimulating to the palate. \u00a0The deveined and deshelled prawns that came with it were tasty and fresh.KUEH BENG KAH: \u00a0If there is something known as a life-changing dessert, then this must be it! This tapioca cake looked innocently like an ordinary slice of cheesecake but was actually a slice of heaven in disguise. The cake had a good balance between softness and springiness, was browned on the top but moist inside. \u00a0It was mildly but not overly sweet (perfect!) and had a refreshing and delightful taste. \u00a0It was topped with Gula Melaka (palm sugar) syrup and served with a side of warm coconut milk.",

Reservations are a must. \u00a0You can dine in the grand hall or on their scenic veranda. The menu is focused on Singaporean Asian influences. \u00a0The service was fantastic. \u00a0They were very accommodating for those of us in the group with dietary restrictions. \u00a0The wine selection for a fancy spot was mediocre. \u00a0Stick with the cocktails here. \u00a0I was with a large group and everyone enjoyed their food, better than our expectations! \u00a0I had the house specialty, the Beef Padang with coconut rice. \u00a0I could have eaten the coconut rice by itself. \u00a0It was PHENOMENAL!! \u00a0The local chicken rice was bland in comparison. \u00a0The beef padang paired with the coconut rice was one of my favorite dishes while in Singapore.NOTE: If you are low on fitbit steps, just go to the bathroom a couple of times. It's a trek to the restrooms located in the museum. \u00a0It's easy to get lost. \u00a0Definitely ask the staff for directions. They will actually walk out a bit with you and point you in the general direction until you find the signs that then lead you to the museum bathrooms in that section of the building.",

The chicken was tender and easily tear apart.Fish Head Curry ($42) Red snapper fish head stewed in an aromatic curry of cumin, fennel, chilies, turmeric and onions with tomatoes, baby eggplants and okraThe curry was the indian version. It tasted quite spicy at first, but one ate more it became quite smooth and rich in taste. Although the serving looked small, the fish head packed lots of chunky meat in it.Chap Chye ($15++)Classic nyonya festive dish of braised mixed vegetables and bean curd skin in a rich prawn bisqueThe sauce was savoury but it was lacking of the dried shrimps which was usually associated with the dish and the vegetables would be better if braised until soft. The vegetables was still crunchy.We have the dishes with Chicken rice rice ($3++) and Nasi lemak rice ($2++), which was oily and flavourful on it own.",

There is so much promise in a restaurant lauded as a national treasure - the colonial style decor while unsurprising, is tasteful; and the menu looks like the perfect curation of reimagined Peranakan staples and local favorites. We ordered Hainanese chicken rice for our 2 year old, Buah Keluak noodles, Ngoh Hiang, Chap Chye, and Itek Tim to share. Chicken rice was boring at best - bland chili (not spicy and a tad sweet - yuck), overdressed chicken, and flavorless rice. \u00a0So uneventful that our kid, who loves chicken rice, spat out each mouthful and looked at the contents of her palm with curious disgust. The noodles and chap chye were so overwhelming in flavor - it was as if we were munching on spoonfuls of keluak essence and fermented bean paste. The slices of duck breast in the soup were rubbery; hinting at rookie soup prep. The ngoh hiang might have been the only saving grace - it was tasty and generous; \u00a0if not for the heart burn I'm suffering from now.I'd hoped for so much more. Instead of dishes that were heinously over-indexed on pleasing the tourist palate, and so off-colour in representing some of our nation's culinary gems. I am not opposed to an occasional indulgence in a quality tourist trap \u00a0- I do love Chatterbox. And perhaps living in the vicinity of Katong where some of the best Peranakan food institutions operate has spoilt me rotten, but I know for sure that naming this joint National Kitchen is a real a misnomer. I have no idea why this place gets the stunning reviews. The only reason it's getting 2 stars is the solid service and ambience. But definitely not enough to bring me back there.",

We had: beef rendang, chicken rice, tauhu goreng, satay, and buah keluak noodles that were drowning in spice.The main negative, imo, is the ambience, or rather the lack of one. They've simply crammed too many tables into a small space. Our party of seven was compressed into a booth comfortably meant for four. The other upside of this - acoustics are really bad and you can barely hear yourself talking. It was a relief to leave, if only so that I could stretch my legs out.Service was normal, except for the waiter who kept stepping on my foot without apologizing (again, another problem with squeezing as many paying customers as you can into your booths). I'd give it two stars, but I thought I'd better balance out the absurdly biased poem of a review below.I've had better Peranakan food at malls, and better ambience at nearly any other restaurant in Singapore. Try at your own peril. I'll be sticking to the House of Peranakan at Katong or Tiong Bahru instead!",

    "text": "\"Curry Fish Head, Beef Rendang, Cod Fish in Creamy Laksa Sauce, Idly with Tomato Chutney and Coconut, Sambal Kimchang Udang....\" Wait a minute. All these are too much for sharing between 3 pax, especially when the Curry Fish Head is recommended for 5-6 pax. However, there were simply too many items that we wished to try on the menu. After a long deliberation, we finally settled on the Baked Cod Fish in Creamy Laksa Sauce ($34++) instead of the curry fish head. The portion turned out to be small, roughly the size of a teenager's palm. Nonetheless, a main cod dish costs an average of $40 these days and this would be quite sufficient for one pax. The laksa gravy was creamy and not too spicy--perfect for those who have a low spice tolerance. In fact, it was one of the best tasting dishes from the newly opened National Kitchen by Violet Oon which offers a repertoire of Nyonya, Chinese, Malay and Indian cuisine. While some said that there is finally a proper restaurant that serves the true national cuisine, I felt that it is still quite early to jump to this conclusion as not all dishes are made equal. The Hakka Abacus Beads ($16++) were too chewy and there were hardly any trace of taro even though the minced meat topping was flavorful and salty. I wonder if it is due to the heavy rich flavors of the other dishes we've had as the Nyonya Chap Chye ($15++) lacked the fermented oomph in the sauce. Nonetheless, my eyes instantly lit up when I saw the Daging Chabek Beef Cheeks ($34++), a hunky slab of meltingly tender meat with bits of fats and chewy tendon drenched in appetizing red tamarind Gula Melaka and coconut gravy. Some might prefer this Indonesian Peranakan twice-cooked beef to be softer but the slightly sinewy texture was just right for me. The first taste was sweet, followed by a subtle heat that triggered a mild sensation on the tongue. The gradual layerings of spices made this a far cry from the typical hot-headed, straightforward kind of Sambal Chilli. Wouldn't it be great if this comes with a complimentary bowl of rice instead of charging them?:)One unique dish that is only available at this outlet and rarely available elsewhere in Singapore is the Opor Nangka Udang ($14++). I can't compare the Young Jackfruit since I haven't tasted it before. However, I had imagined it to be creamy and rich rather than diluted. Stewed in salted fish and prawns in a coconut gravy, the chunks of young jackfruits were short of the typical pungency of a jackfruit, hence those who usually stay away from jackfruits may enjoy this dish. The sauce was mildly sweet but there wasn't anything attractive that would anchor my love and thus it is something I would not order again. We rounded off the meal with two cakes, one of which is the hot-seller Pineapple Upside Down Cake. Served warm in a pool of chilled condensed milk sauce, it isn't anything spectacular, but still a charming diva in the world of butter cakes--soft, moist with finely textured crumbs. Just don't attempt to recall or flip through the menu for the price or you will feel the pinch when you realized it cost a hefty $12++. The Kueh Beng Ka ($9++) aka grated tapioca cake was a faithful rendition of the traditional Nyonya sweet, made extra delicious with coconut milk and gula Melaka syrup. The cake was silky smooth like a baked custardy kueh, though it might be too smooth for those who prefer some rough gritty texture. Considering the price range, this place is still more suited for special occasions or for foreign visitors who want to try local food in posh ambience. I was impressed by the eclectic mix of vintage and southeast Asian decor with old black-and-white photographs that draw similarities to Colony @ The Ritz-Carlton. It made me feel as if I was dining in a wealthy Peranakan mansion helmed by a matriarch. However, the dining experience felt cramped and stiff as the tables were positioned too closely to one another. I think it might be best to come before 7pm even for weekdays. Otherwise, you not only have to wait longer for the food, but also have to raise your voices to speak as the place turns into a wet MARKET when it is full-house.",

    "text": "Went for lunch here a couple of weeks ago. Our party of 2 arrived before noon to an almost-empty restaurant but we're told that all tables were booked and we had to sit at the bar. The place did fill up while we were eating but there were still a couple of empty tables by the time we left, so we could have taken that.Anyway, it was our first time here and we were impressed by the food. Had kueh pie tyeh, beef rendang and dry laksa. The taste was good, and the beef rendang portion was big-- 3 small-palm sized pieces of tender beef. I had iced tea, way overpriced at $9. We finished it off with coffee.The decor and ambience are really nice but I find the food quite overpriced. Will come back and bring visitors from overseas but I don't think I will go regularly.",

    "text": "Second visit to National Kitchen, third overall to Violet Oon's restaurants. Still as good, possibly surpassed my memory of how delicious the food is!This time I tried the gado gado for starters ($18) which was very substantial and filling for two. The peanut sauce was amazing. Even my dining partner who is a wuss with spicy food cannot stop herself scraping the sauce up with the remaining crackers! Tempeh was delish. Beef rendang -- as fork tender as ever with a strong coconut-based rempah, very good, wish I had bread to mop it all up. Dry laksa remains a classic. We tried the buah keluak noodles this time and I found this dish the weakest -- Candlenut does it better. I remember the desserts were all sub par in my previous dining experiences, so skip the pineapple upside down cake or gula Melaka something and order the kueh da da: Pandas crepe wrap of coconut. Do make reservations days ahead even for weekday lunches! And, the restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous.",

    "text": "Peranakan House RebornStepping into National Kitchen is akin to stepping into another mini museum of its own. Or rather the realms of a Peranakan house.Over 200 peranakan tiles cover some of the wall of the 3000 sq ft restaurant located in the heart of National Gallery, while other corners spot old photos. The titles came form old houses that have been torn down, but still very much worthy as part of historic restorations. Ms Violet Oon 66, has been a strong advocate of \u00a0'The Singapore Taste' through her cooking and writings and has set up National Kitchen to advocate just that.  There is another outlet going by the name of Violet Oon Singapore located in Bukit Timah Road and we were there to celebrate the birthday for my bestie!The InteriorThe design of the restaurant came about with the help of a Design Innovation Assistance grant from the Design Singapore Council. With the grant they brought the best designs in this restaurant, driven by local design house Black. To create a homey feeling, spot the little touches around. You will be able to see spice pots near the entrance. From documentary, the restaurant's bar and takeaway boxes is green in tone, to reflect Ms Oon's Chinese name- Swee Gek meaning Jade.Read the rest of the review here: faithjoyhope.blogspot.co\u2026",
