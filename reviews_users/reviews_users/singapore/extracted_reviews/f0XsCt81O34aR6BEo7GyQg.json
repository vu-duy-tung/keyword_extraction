I had the veggie enchilada dish and I was not dissapointed with the serving size. Both of my friends got meat dishes that had large portions as well, so we were all really happy about it. Overall, food was good. Not amazing, but you leave satisfied.Our margarita drinks were not lame either - and were strong enough.They also didn't skimp on the sour cream and guac so we really appreciated that.",

We had to send it back to be cooked more (I.e., we had wanted medium, had to go well as the meat wasn't good enough for well). Service was quite slow, with them not checking on our meal or refilling water. I ordered ice water, and water came without ice. Took over ten minutes for the check after we requested it. Ambience was nice. Will try again, curious about burritos and fajitas.",

Luckily, the meat (both chicken and beef) was good...not great....but good and not dried out, so the meal was edible. \u00a0Side rice was not Mexican or Spanish or Latin in taste. \u00a0Sadly, the best part of my meal was the side of black beans. For a minimum of S$18++/a dish I would expect higher efforts. \u00a0If they hadn't put a couple slices of jalapenos on the top, the dish would be totally lacking in flavor. \u00a0If the restaurant would simply invest in a few spices (go on and add it to the guac too...it sure needs them), the meal could be WORLDS better. \u00a0 I admit that it is hard to find authentic Tex-mex here in Singapore, but pretty much every other place I have tasted on the island is better. \u00a0I didn't opt to try the margaritas (wow...highway robbery). \u00a0I will make my own at home!",

Had their chicken enchiladas, was a 4star for me compared to the general ones out there. Also had the best nachos here (the one with black beans and guacamole). Ordered a virgin mojito, can't go wrong with that. the concoction was balanced and perfect for if you find the green chilli spicy. Their spice level is very manageable relative to other Mexican restaurants. Will definitely come back again and again :)",

The chicken taco salad was OK, \u00a0but the Christmas special menu item crab au gratin was delicious. It came with tortilla and a sauce that tasted like olives. For dessert we had toffee pudding with chili. It was good. Service was friendly and fast. I don't think that this is authentic Mexican food. It's more Tex-Mex.

It was corrected, we paid and sat for another 10 mins before leaving the restaurant.

Some of my personal favorites are the taco salad that comes with generous amounts of chicken, veggies, cheese, and kidney beans (though it seems like they've cut back on the amount of black beans served in return) and the US prime rib, which is very tender and well marinated.

Throughout our meal, the staff was friendly but rushed. \u00a0For this, I have deducted one star from their overall review.The ambiance is great. I actually really liked the room. \u00a0It has very high ceilings. The earthen tones make for a warm inviting environment. \u00a0There are lots of paintings on the wall. \u00a0It would be a great space for a party.tinyurl.com/bayzxalWe each ordered a cocktail. \u00a0I had a frozen lime margarita. \u00a0She had a frozen strawberry daiquiri. \u00a0My margarita was a tad on the bitter side. \u00a0Outside of that, it reminded me of a margarita made with basic margarita mix.tinyurl.com/bx6ezg6tinyurl.com/as8a663The food was average to relatively good.Chicken Fajitas - \u00a0I could almost cut and paste my review of the steak fajitas from La Salsa. \u00a0They were very generous with the chicken. \u00a0It did come on a sizzling platter. \u00a0The seasoning seemed like something straight out of pre-made spice mix. \u00a0They were not nearly as generous with the condiments. \u00a0Plus, these also appeared to be straight out of cans, jars, or bottles. \u00a0The guacamole had no texture to it. \u00a0The salsa was no better that Tostito's. \u00a0They did not provide beans or rice. \u00a0If you are going to charge $30+ for chicken fajitas, they should darn well come with beans and rice. \u00a0The tortillas were well heated.In the end, these were decent fajitas. \u00a0If the salsa and guacamole had been better, it could have made a big difference. tinyurl.com/a6h7mohCondiments:tinyurl.com/balvrr8Margarita Chicken - My dinner date ordered their Margarita Chicken. \u00a0I did not try it. \u00a0The dish look pretty appetizing. \u00a0She enjoyed it.tinyurl.com/aqqova8Receipt (Dinner for 2 - $110.64):tinyurl.com/b5us2cfOverall - Rushed service led to a rushed dining experience. \u00a0Nice spacious room. \u00a0Large US chain-level quality Tex-Mex food. \u00a0If you really have a hankerin' for some Tex-Mex or pseudo Mexican food, they will do. \u00a0So you do not get rushed out the door, I suggest going well before 10 pm.",

Parking was alright as there were still empty spots when I arrived. It will be more crowded around 7pm on weekdays and no doubt on weekends.It is my first time eating at a Mexican Restaurant in Singapore so I can't really compare yet (more reviews for the ones in California).When My aunt and I stepped indoor, there were reserved signs on most table. The servers did not really hear us out on wanting the indoor seat and had to repeat ourselves for three times before they gave us a corner table for two.Looking at the menu, there were a range of choices. I looked into the burrito section and spotted beef chimichanga. My aunt ordered something else.For drinks, I had a strawberry jarritos. Missed this soda ever since I stepped in Singapore. The food came 15 minutes later and came in a big portion. I was amazed at the portion and expected a smaller portion for a huge price ($18). The tortilla outside was crispy. The black bean with cheese was delicious but there are too much chunks of shredded beef. On my plate there was a side of rice and a side of cabbage/lettuce. The portion is too big for the taste. I would prefer less meat to savor the sour cream and the avocado instead. (1/2 star deducted here).We called for checks and it came to a more shocking amount. 7% gst, 10% service charge. In the end two meals, two drinks added up around $70+. I think that they need to cut down the price. (This is why 1/2 star is deducted).Overall it is alright to go there once awhile. But since there was no other reviews i was not sure what's good here.",

    "text": "When I went there the first time, I picked it because it had the most crowd compared to its neighboring restaurants. When the dinner finished, we were certain that we had made the right decision. Since then, I went back a few times when I wanted to eat Mexican food. The business is always good, and there's lots of Mexican expats - a sign that the food is authentic perhaps? I highly recommend their Steak, done in the traditional Mexican way. It's very tender and juicy. Atmosphere is very classy. The food is pricey, but it's standard for Dempsey.",
