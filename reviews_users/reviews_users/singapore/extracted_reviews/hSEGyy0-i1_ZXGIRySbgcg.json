However, chances are you'll have to wait (for your table, and to be served, as they seem pretty popular). The only thing that ticked me off was waiting more than half an hour for dessert, which I ultimately cancelled in the end.",

Only the queue that starts building about 30minutes before opening time can give you a inkling that there is something special. And yes, there is: this place has a short menu (3 starters, 3-5 main courses, two types of wine by the glass) that is largely French-Italian inspired but that also shows some bright local inspirations. I had angel hair sort of alio-olio but with a twist (I still don't know what the twist was, but it was good: sakura ebi paste?), followed by pork belly (perfect! melting in the mouth) with a poached egg and on a bed of lentils. My colleagues had boeuf bourguignon which looked a bit predictable.The prices are unbeatable and come to about 18 SGD per person. No reservations, but you really have to make sure you're there in time for the queue..One negative note: for some reason, this place is very popular with young women (nothing negative about that), and that makes the noise level go up a few notches..",

But having charged for ice water, you had to asked for it to be topped up, that's is if you can get the attention of a server. Wines too, they never come round to ask if you'd like another round, desserts etc? It's like just eat up and go kind of place.Zero ambience and noisy too. Of course the only saving grace is that it is very affordable French food. The duck confit, I though was too dry, maybe it's not a good day for the chef.. Beef bourguignon was good enough though. Didn't try the desserts as we decided to go somewhere else.Portions a little small, both for food and wine. Good place for an introduction to French \"cuisine\". Just temper your expectations, and put the money saved in your piggy bank for your next meal at les Amis .",

Saveur offers french food to the masses at reasonable prices. The small but filling meals highlight the simplicity of french food with complex flavours. Only negative is the wine list. Out of the 6 listed, only 2 were available and they were not French wines either! *shock horror*. My fellow dining partner is a bit of a wine connoisseur and politely enquired about the average at best wine after returning 2 glasses that he deemed undrinkable. After a lot of genuine apologies by the waiter and the owner, they look both glasses off the total bill. Being courteous, he declined but thought it was very kind of them.Despite the lack of wine, the food is amazing. If only this place was BYO it would solve the wine issue!Tip: Book before! The lines can be crazy and don't be put off having to wait 15-20 minutes for a table, because its well worth it.",

The menu is simple and not exactly extensive, but the chef is good at what he does and prepares each dish with special care. Upon stepping into the restaurant, I peeked at the other tables and saw the duck confit dish on almost every table so I told myself I had to order one too. This top seller is indeed amazing; the exterior was crispy and the meat inside was juicy and succulent. The mashed potato heap that the duck was lying on top of was creamy and buttery as well, complementing the flavors of the duck. Not only that, there were sauted mushrooms and orange segments on the side too, all for only $8.90. I must say that happiness here sure comes cheap. For dessert, I ordered the pistachio panna cotta that was light yet creamy at the same time, definitely fulfilling. The service was a tad slow, but the good food made up for it.",

    "text": "As this was a visit last year in September, the menu is likely to have changed slightly now but still worth it to spread the good word with everyone. As fish lovers, our main courses were of course, fish. The Pan-fried monk fish is quite a rare sight in French cuisine but this was executed well with interesting combination of cabbage, leek fondue and monk fish jus. It was chewy or slightly rubbery but it was the slabs of golden brown potato which left me with a deep impression till today.The Barramundi with Crab Potato and French Beans did not shine as much as the monkfish. The salted crust did not conceal the dry flesh and it was a relatively small portion. But one wonders why the cubed potatoes are called crab potatoes?We could not miss this Sakura ebi angel hair pasta ($3.90) as it was one of their signature dishes. The verdict was that it tasted quite average as the pasta was not fully al dente. I guessed it was the aroma of the Sakura ebi and minced pork that rescued the dish.Perhaps the strength of Saveur lies in their desserts than mains. This chocolate and hazelnut is a must order for chocolate fans. We had it at $7.90 but seems like the price has gone up. other desserts include pistachio pudding and their special dessert of the day, which consists of :apple risotto/cinnamon puff pastry/ caramel biscuits soil/ cheese yoghurt foam/ toffee jelly /celery and apple ice . \u00a0So long right? haha;)The ambitious plating style that resembled fine dining desserts was commendable but too many stuff on one plate confuses the diners.",

Crispy skin, moist and tender meat, on top of a pillow of bouchon worthy mashed potatoes (1:1 potato: butter). I had the angel hair pasta, but I'm not sure if it was the intention, but it kinda tasted like asian ta-mee. The flavor was great, don't get me wrong, but there's something about a tiny prawn-infused oil sauce that screams asian. It was still tasty, just not what I was expecting. The foie gras for 10 bucks was very decent. Like I said, a place with value for money grub. Better to go in twos than fours, I only spent 15 min waiting on a thursday night. :)",

Gave the dish some heat! Like many reviews have stated, the duck confit is a must. The chicken roulade was ok. I was not crazy about my dish and regretted not ordering the duck confit myself.

The general opinion seems to be divided, half the people love it, half think it's overrated.So I went with my friends and our verdict: Not bad at all!We tried the Foie Gras ($7.90 if I remember correctly) and it was really good. But don't laugh at me I'm not really a big fan of foie gras and maybe it's an acquired taste? All I can say is that for such a price the foie gras was really quite decent.I also tried the much-raved about duck. Okay this one really impressed me because I'm also not a big fan of duck but wow!!! The meat was tender and flavorful, but what really made me fall in love with the dish was the mashed potatoes and the mushrooms. LOVE!!! And all for a steal at $10.90!My friend had the chicken at $9.90, but when it came she was shocked because it's so small! There were maybe 4-5 slices of chicken on a bed of rice? She finished it so quickly and I could tell she was quite dissatisfied...That's why I gave Saveur 3 stars. The portions are too small!! If I bring my boyfriend here (he has a huge appetite) a main wouldn't fill his tummy at all :( but I guess we get what we pay for, and we'll still return cos the angel hair pasta appetizer that almost every other table had looks yummy!My other friends also had the duck, so I'd say avoid the chicken unless you're seriously on a budget or a diet.Also, we went at 12pm so there was no line. But after awhile the place was packed and the line was never-ending, so go early if you don't wanna wait too long! Idk if Saveur takes reservations...Please check out my blog (on my profile) for photos! :)",

There isn't much ingredients in this pasta but yet this pasta captures so much flavour. I also ordered the duck confit for my main course which was splendid as well! The duck was cooked to perfection and the sweetness from the fruit served with the duck complemented it's taste.All in all, I spent approximately $18 per person.I am so glad that I managed to chance upon this quaint little place. However, it is indeed difficult to get a seat here if you aren't early so my advice is that you go to the shop once it's open! This place is more of a chill out place so it's great to bring your friends and join in the buzz in the shop!",

    "text": "[they are worth 3.5 instead]During the Middle Ages, the French diets and cooking techniques hardly changed unlike the current, when more and more refined ones are notably seen in most restaurants - a changed in the dietary norm shaping most palate of our era.Often, haute cuisine has been highly thought of as highway robbery - fair value estimated for its meticulous preparation and luxurious presentation. Some truth in it, yes. Hardly less exorbitant anywhere, except at Saveur where prices are friendly. Less convincing it may be, \u00a0as we are taught to believe that lower expenditure equates inferior food quality and mediocre taste. To prove otherwise, Saveur could be one that is worth experimenting.Simple casual but not missing out the con-tempo, the dining area was decked in a non-flashy modish outfit, with mascot, distinctive wall paintings that backdrop the area. Nothing too fanciful as well, the menu was kept to a minimal with 8 entree (starters); 6 Plat Principal (mains) with 3 extra side dishes; 3 desserts plus 1 occasional special.You could begin with a nice bread roll that comes with a butter-spread, barely $2. For as little as $4.90, I received a signature Saveur's pasta for a decent portion, approximately a size of half the mains - amazing \"student/elderly concession\" fare. I have to agree that this pasta dish is a steal without compromising on its taste. I feel good to be poked at when the chili oil smeared my lips, while chewing the sakura ebi that capped the surface of that angel hair - cooked al dente.yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/s\u2026The foie gras on the other hand fared slightly inferior. Without any bit of crisp, I couldn't read the contrast between its exterior and middle segment. I have expected the searing to be slightly obvious on its upper cap, but the whole duck liver turned out having a uniform smooth surface. Strips and diced apples were infused with port wine and vanilla pod to pair up the soft and melty organ - good effort but will do more justice if the liver was richer in taste. Instead, the least expected Duck Salad captured the most votes. Less interesting but the boring greens were made alive when you nibbled at those duck confit shreds - the salty elements (milder than a traditional duck confit) mingled with a hint of tang from the lemon vinaigrette, coupled with some zesty orange wedge, cherry tomatoes, and a few teeny quail eggs, the composition was made to shine on the whole. I would ditch the delicate foie gras and pick the fresh salad when I revisit, barely $5.90 in exchanged for a $9.90.yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/s\u2026Duck confit - a salt cured piece of duck leg poached in its own fats for up to 10hours, is one of the classic French dish. Saveur served a good portion of it without excessive greasiness, tender but slightly dry in the meat. Well crisped skin without any flabbiness, the magnificent crunch was accompanied by less fibrous shred of duck meat each time - not overly rich or briny. Be ready for the aromatic compound emitted from the limb and get ready for the heap of homemade mashed potato which has been dribbled with orange infuse natural jus in circular fashion, together with some saut\u00e9 shiitake mushroom, orange segment as an accompaniment. Although less than stellar version, it is still a respectable fried item for the price you pay - $10.90.yelp.com.sg/biz_photos/s\u2026The pork belly scored a few points lower. Visible fats can be seen on its 4-sided walls with a golden blistered skin capping on top. Layers of fats were lined between each lean section, giving its glossy appearance. Quite on par with the pork belly, the Sea Bass was presented in its deep seared exterior, waiting to shine in the crowd. Like a home-cooked, this fish reminds me of my mum's favourite dish in the kitchen.2 notches lower, I rated the Beef Short Rib critically. Braised in red wine, the meat was faced with resistance when forked through and chewy in the mouth. It didn't seem that it has been undercooked and far less overcooked, but I failed to recognise the rewarding fork-tenderness short rib meat. Kind enough, the beef jus was less greasy, balanced and rich in taste.Lethal moment took place in the sweet intoxication outbreak. The Pistachio Panna Cotta outshone its peer. Sheer sweet but not cloying, the green curd was made both creamier and nutty. The Chocolate & Hazelnut reminds me of the one I had at Covelli Italian Bistro & Wine Bar but a beet version. A creamy and far from sticky mousse, less intense chocolate flavour and dominated by its candied taste. Made using milk chocolate, the piece is then met with a handful of sourish freeze-dried raspberry bits to average out the overly sweet nature; together with the crushed hazelnuts for some bite",

Had a delicious sea bass, with truffle mash on the side, and it was tasty. The salted caramel lava cake was pretty delicious too! Main and dessert for 3 people, plus a bottle of wine came to S$150, so fairly decently priced too. I'll definitely be going back.It was pretty busy, so make sure you make a reservation - and do show up on time. We were told they would only hold the table for 15 mins past our reservation, otherwise they'd give it away to one of the groups lines up outside waiting to get in!",

    "text": "Saveur must have been the best thing to happen on the French food dining scene in a long time. There are long queues snaking outside the restaurant each time we walk or drive past during dining hours and when we finally got round to trying the food, we were not at all surprised!The price point undoubtedly is a huge draw. Quality French food at affordable prices, we constantly scratch our heads and wonder, how do they do it? Pan fried foie gras with lentils goes for $7.90 and confit of salmon goes for $8.90, both were highly commendable. The duck confit was a bit on the dry side, but for $8.90 we aren't really complaining.Friends are big fans of the angel hair pasta with tiger prawns and lumpfish caviar but not so much of the beef bourgignon, which doesn't come in a stew like we were expecting, but as a steak-like dish. The desserts are pretty amazing, we love the textures of citrus and chocolate mousse with hazelnuts ... yum!Go early to queue as they don't take reservations.",

    "text": "A rather large crowd even on a weekday evening. People started streaming from 7.30pm onwards and both units were filled to the brim by 8pm. They did not allow reservations but did have a \"waiting list\" for you to put your name and number down. They also had a policy of only seating groups with more than 80% of the headcount present. The most popular dishes seemed to be the Confit of Duck with Orange Segments and Saut\u00e9 Shittake and Angel Hair pasta with Sherry minced Pork and Sakura Ebi so we ordered those. We also added an order of Crispy Pork Belly with poached Egg and Diced Vegetables. The Angel Hair Pasta arrived relatively quickly. First impression? It was such a tiny serving! But I guess its reasonable at $3.90. My friend commented that the Sakura Ebi was just a nice name for what we Singaporeans would usually refer to as Hay Bee though HAHA The wait for the other two dishes was much longer, \u00a0but I was appeased when the Duck Confit arrived looking was absolutely delicious. I was a huge fan of entire dish, from the duck to the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. The skin was crispy while the meat remained tender. A Must Order for me! The Crispy Pork Belly was a disappointment though, the skin seemed to be a little over-cooked.Prices were certainly affordable for a restaurant of this standard. The staff were also helpful and our glasses were constantly refilled. Overall a good place for affordable food!",

Not highly recommended, but for $5, get this primi.Secondi: the entire table got the duck confit so I sampled some. For $16 it's a steal. Seriously, it was 90% as good as the 1-stars serve in Paris.

A word of advice though - be prepared to queue for up to 45 minutes during peak hours!My friend and I ordered the Angel Hair Pasta With Tiger Prawn And Lumpfish Caviar \u00a0and Mesclun Salad With Lemon Vinaigrette And Crispy Duck as starters. The pasta was delicious and we gobbled it up pretty quickly, but the duck salad was not so appetizing. The meat was dry and the salad was really oily. For mains, she ordered the Confit Of Duck With Orange Segment And Saut\u00e9 Shittake while I ordered the Beef Bourgeon With Root Vegetable And Mixed Green. She enjoyed her dish but I didn't particularly enjoy mine as the chunks of beef were very fatty when I was expecting something more tender. We both shared the Pistachio Panna Cotta which was the perfect finish to our meal! Definitely order this if you're a fan of nuts. The dishes at Saveur are a hit or a miss, but at these prices, there isn't much to complain. The long queue is a turn off though, so I'd probably only return to this place when its hype dies down.",

    "text": "For full reviews and more pictures, visit my blog.Saveur is known as the decent and highly affordable French food for the masses in Singapore. Since their humble beginnings at the Ali Baba Eating House (i'm serious) in Katong, the young chefs have gone a long way and have even made a mark for themselves at Purvis Street. My friend said that they have expanded from their original store front the next store in order to meet the demands of the customers. \u00a0For starters, we had the Signature Saveur pasta tossed with chili oil, fine-chopped Japanese konbu and sakura ebi with minced pork sauce ($4.90). This is the Italian version of our local minced pork noodles. The texture of the angel hair pasta makes it more delicate than its fat mee pok cousin. Kind of reminded me of Iggy's signature cappellini. Of course, every cents count towards the quality but this is not too shady. From the Special menu, the Seafood Pasta with Tiger Prawn and Lumpfish Caviar ($6.90) is also a crowd pleaser. Perfectly al dente noodles which is well flavored by the natural seafood sweetness. The taste is lighter than the signature pasta and the spring onions gives each mouthful a refreshing burst when you bite into them. Prawns are a wee small though but it's only $6.90. If you want something smaller, perhaps pick from the 2 different pan-seared Foie Gras: One served with creamy lentils and pickled pearl onion ($7.90) and the other with apples infused with port wine and vanilla bean ($9.90). I wasn't too much of a fan of their foie gras as it was on the grainy and powdery side. La Petite's (another cheap French place at Serene Centre and Thomson) tasted better in my memory. Duck Confit ($10.90) is their hot favorite. The flatted and pan fried duck leg was served atop homemade mashed potato with saute shiitake mushroms, orange segments and orange infused natural juice. I like that the meat wasn't too salty or dry and the creamy thick mash helped to give it a little moisture. It may look small but i was very satisfied even after giving S a few bites of my dish. The Pan-seared sea bass with diced saute potato...",

Today's experience was kind of disappointing for me.I have to agree that for the price to pay, the serving portion and variety of food is truly not too bad. This is especially so for the foie gras. Love it. Likewise for the angel hair pasta. However, I've definitely had better duck confit.What made today's experience negative was the whole confusion of order. We ordered 2 appetizers to share and an entree of duck confit each. After waiting for sometime, the 2 entrees arrived and there were no appetizers served. That left us confused and upon asking, the servers checked and then served up the angel hair pasta promptly. 1/4 through the meal, they then served our other appetizer but instead of the foie gras that we ordered, they served us a salad. After checking (again), we were about 3/4 through our entree when the foie gras finally arrived.The quality of the food commensurates to the price payable but since we are also paying service charge, I would expect the service to be slightly better. Since long queues are such a problem and the servers and kitchen get flustered with all the overload of orders, the restaurant operations may want to rethink on this issue to manage the flow of customers vs quality of service. I wouldn't mind going back again cos it's value for money but perhaps only after the craze and fad slows down so at least the service will match up to their quality of food.",

    "text": "I'm not one to follow the herd in my day job and general life choices but I have to say Saveur is a crowd pleaser.Spartan but decent cervenza list (Super Bock )? Unobtrusive dressing and well tossed salad? Check and check (and I'm still reeling from the shock of finding a restaurant that knows how to pick out wilted leaves and not slobber dressing).My roast pork belly was not bad but not \u00a0mind blowing like at Hellenika or my atit's awesome Babi Guleng. I liked the sweet lentils and poached eggs as accompaniments. Smells like there's some schooled chefs in the kitchen. Dude had the duck and his comments were similar to mine. Best part, we're talking quality food at prices that allow you to not share. My wallet chimed in, \"how crazy is that? In Singapore??!\"The waitresses were attentive, the check was fast when we asked for it and there is a semblance of a wait list system. This is one place where the line outside the door makes absolute, complete sense. And it's not because of Hello Kitty folks.",

The central location is also another BIG plus!The duck confit and the chocolate mousse were both really good and definitely worth the price.We asked the service staff to suggest which wine we should get and although the staff did not know a single thing about the wines they were serving, she went to get a taster for us without us even asking for it! This totally impressed me. She may not actually know the wine (a big boo boo if this is an expensive place but quite acceptable for a casual eatery in Singapore) but the way she went that extra mile for us was absolutely great. So another BIG plus for the service!A must try!!!",

    "text": "French food on the budget is always good. Been going back there so often over the last 3 weeks. First off, I really enjoy the pastas. Each time I was there, I always ordered a serving of each of the two pastas. For once pasta, minced pork paste coats the pasta nicely and the saltiness of the dried shrimp gives it that extra edge.The other pasta came with bits of tiger prawns and lumpfish caviar. I always remove the caviar first, so that I can ration it as i go along. Too good to be mixed into the pasta. Of course the signature main dish is the duck confit. Crispy skin, lovely mash. Happy days.I also ordered the beef bourguignon and it was very well cooked. The meat was tender and flavourful and I enjoyed it very much.",

    "text": "Affordable, tasty French food! Mon Dieu! What a find!I've been going to Saveur to eat since their humble beginnings in a roadside coffeeshop in Joo Chiat. They had a limited menu and even more limited seating space! But they're food is great and affordable, and so they've done so well they've expanded and moved to Purvis Street! I went to Saveur to see if their standards had been maintained, and was pleasantly surprised to see that their menu has also expanded with them to include more dishes.I really liked the ambience and interior at the new Saveur. It's well lit, and well spaced, so diners don't feel too cramped together. The service is alright, but I didn't really care about that. I needed to know if the food was still incredible and affordable... I ordered the Angel Hair Pasta with Tiger Prawn and Lumpfish Caviar which was flavoursome, but light and satisfying as an appetizer. However, they did stinge on the prawns and it came with tiny bits of prawn, which left me a little disgruntled. I also had a small Fois Gras - here you can have the option of a large portion of 70 grams or a smaller one at 35 grams - and found it a little overcooked and dry so that was disappointing. And for my main, I had the signature Duck Confit with Orange and Mushrooms... That did not disappoint one bit. It was tasty and tender, with the complementary oranges and sauce on a bed of potato mash. The duck skin was very crispy, but not oily, and the meat was not gamey at all.All up, the meal cost me about $20+, which is very cheap! Will be back to try their other dishes! My food came quite quickly despite it being full house that day. Make sure you come early, as the queues during peak hour get quite ridiculous, so be prepared to wait for a table, and then for your food.",

Food was generally delish, had the set dinner (at $29.90 is quite reasonable): started with the foie gras for appetizer, followed by beef bourguignon as mains, and chocolate with hazelnut sauce for dessert. My friend ordered the angel hair pasta for 3 way sharing, and loved it.The foie gras-lentils combination was a pleasant start, lightly salted to balance the palate. The beef was extremely tender, an easy bite, the stew was not too thick (which i liked). Dessert was lovely, though would liked more hazelnut sauce.Perhaps I was expecting too much, though the food did not disappoint, the service was barely there. Perhaps it was just a very casual dining place where service was kept at a minimal. Perhaps perhaps.",

She put down the beer bottle and walked off, while I watched as it foamed everywhere. No one grabbed a cloth for the table or glass, no one apologised, and I just waited in vain for it to settle.Food was a bit bland. Duck rillette was fine, though accompanying bread was over oily. Main of fish was a reasonable size but again bland and felt unbalanced - small fish steak, too many potatoes, not enough veges. Food did come fast though.Like I said, wanted to like but walked away feeling unsatisfied. Maybe you need that extra level of care to make French food shine?",

The food quality remains high; service is adequate; the price is slightly higher now, but still of great value. Read on if interested. - Peter, Apr 2015This charming bistro is a gem! It's conveniently located on Purvis, nearby the Library, and not far from the InterContinental Hotel and the Raffles Hotel.Locals love it and try to keep it a secret! Tourists must go there and enjoy! With its great food at value prices, be prepared for a long wait, but totally worth it! Go EARLY!- Its signiture Duck Confit is a must try!  - This restaurant has an eye-pleasing and comfortable caf\u00e9 style decor. It offers a nice selection of tasty dishes at low prices (S$6-15). Beer and Wine are expensive in Singapore in general. We found that its house Cabinet Sauvignon by the glass, $7, goes well with the Duck Confit...! Our local friends told us about this nice place. Last Thur evening, my wife and I got there well before 6pm, the place was already almost full. Most of the diners were young folks! We were lucky to get a table. We had its famous duck confit, seabass, duck salad, home fried potato cubes, and a very small bottle of beer. The duck confit was absolutely delicious! However, the seabass was way too bland, and the fish was not firm. The salad and potatos were tasty. The service was not great but adequate. \u00a0When we left around 7pm, the place was packed, and there was a LONG WAITING LINE outside! We'll definitely go back there and try other items on their menu before leaving Singapore.Legend has it that the original Saveur was a \"Hawker in Food Court\" type of establishment. After it was moved to the current location and became a nice French Bistro, its owner still keeps the prices (and his profit) low! How nice of him! Its young chef has reportedly worked in top French restaurants! Wow! I envy Singapore people and especially their young Yelpers!- Peterskis3, Jan 2013",

    "text": "The good: the price of food and wine is extremely low. Although there's much better French food to be had in Singapore, it's very good given the low cost. The tenderloin and boeuf bourguignon are pretty good, the pork belly less so. For the money, the pasta appetizer and the potatos au gratin are very good, the rillette not so much.The bad: no ambiance to speak of. My first impression was that of a loud canteen. I found it disconcerting to order using a paper form (like you'd see at a dim sum restaurant). It's really loud. It's hard to have a conversation or speak with the server, even when the restaurant is only at half-capacity, let alone when it's near full. The service is ok: I think the service shortcomings are more because the restaurant is under-staffed rather than rude or neglectful. The wine list is shockingly brief: two whites, two reds. The Cabernet Sauvignon was good for what it cost ($40).We tried three different desserts, the panna cotta, the lava cake and the milk & cookies. Unlike the appetizers and mains, I think the desserts were quite poor, with the milk & cookies perhaps mediocre.Saveur has clearly identified its target market. It's pretty well packed at dinner. That said, I don't think I would go back. Personally, I'd rather pay more and have a nicer, quieter setting with better food.",

The prices are all very reasonable for the area and I really appreciate the restaurant's efforts at giving customers a affordable way to taste great food. Quite a big fan of most of the starters, soups and mains. Mushroom soup was delicious compared to the heavy cream based nonsense you usually tend to get elsewhere. The Duck confit was also pretty delicious and from what it seems is a crowd pleaser. I personally loved the Ebi shrimp and spaghetti starter as well. Super flavourful.Value for money for sure. Looking to enjoy some good quality food without breaking the bank? This is the place.",

Great food, at an awesome price. The duck was suitably crisp, the skate (stingray) well marinated, and creme brulee well executed.At this price point, it explains the queue snaking out the door and extremely long wait time. You can't expect too much of the ingredient quality, and I noticed a couple of ingredient substitutions along the way.Minus one star for the Bee Gees' greatest hits on repeat, and for the surly attitude. Otherwise, a worthy contender and a place I'd try again perhaps on a weekday evening.",

The pork belly is done very well. Crispy skin, moist meat, tons of flavor. Everything was so good! All the tables around us got the duck confit so it must be good. Wine was very good for $9 a glass (a little small). The chocolate hazelnut mouse was one of the best things I've ever eaten! Dense, cold, great flavor. Covered in frozen raspberries and rice crispy's for texture. Must order.",

We got here around 8 and there were lots of people waiting outside. The hostess said it would be a 20-30 minute wait so we waited. She would of called us when our table was ready but we didn't have a phone. We looked over the menu so we could order when we sat down. WOW the prices are amazing! We ordered 2 foie gras since we can't get it in CA. We also ordered the pasta dish. I got the duck confit and my husband got the beef tenderloin. OMG the foie gras was really good! It melts in your mouth. I preferred the one over lentils instead of the ones over apples. The pasta dish was simple but had tons of flavor. I liked how it had little bright pink dried shrimps on top of the pasta. My duck confit arrived and we started eating that. WOW it was really good. The duck was perfectly seasoned. My husbands entree arrived and we tired his and it was good too. We asked for medium but should have asked for medium rare. It came out medium well but it was still good. We finished our meals and decided to try the tofu cheesecake for dessert. WOW that was good too. This is a great place for date night and good on the pocket too :)",

    "text": "I won't say this is the perfect place to sample french food given the 'chop chop' fast manner they serve the food and the lengthy queues you have to endure to get a seat - The french way of dining is to relax, enjoy and not to get your blood pressure up.We headed over to the place at around 5.45pm as the place opens at 6pm and they don't take reservations! To our surprise, there was already a queue of around 20 people and counting!We joined the queue and was amused as there were more and more people commenting how surprised they were to see such a long queue when the place hasn't even opened yet! Finally, at 6pm sharp, the doors opened. I felt like I was queuing to buy Hello Kitty or Jay Chou tickets. We were seated promptly and in an orderly fashion. Hence, our queuing neighbours in front and behind us got seated on our right and left respectively.There was a mad rush to be the first one to place your order and I can already see the chefs hard at work preparing some of the more popular dishes.I waved for the waitress to come over to take our order and she promptly did so. The waitress frantically took our order much to the chagrin of the lady at the next table as she expected that it was common sense that the waitress turned around to take her order too. Anyway, our order came pretty fast and we were generally satisfied with the meal which was affordable as well.Verdict (forgive me as I forgot the name of the dish):- Saveur's Pasta - Apparently, this is one of the more famous appetizers that people will order. We ordered the main portion size and boy was it good!- Beef Cheeks with Baked Potatoes and Musclun Salad - The 6 beef cubes though not as huge as I hoped for, was so tender it literally melted in my mouth. Every bite was heaven. The baked potatoes had all the comfort-y goodness you can ask for though I must say that the dish itself is very fattening!- Onion Soup - Cannot compare to what we had in Paris but I found the broth a tad too sweet for my liking. Overall, plenty of onion bits to chew on.- Dessert - I cannot remember the name of the dessert but the waitress encouraged us to order this dish which she claimed to be 'very popular and takes 20 mins to make. You should order this as once it is sold out, there is no more.' See my picture for clarity. Very very nice dessert! Apologies again for the lack of a name!Tip: Expect to queue for at least 20 mins if you want to dine here. Do not expect to be served immediately or for the waitress to read your mind to head over to take your order - common restaurant rules still apply. Expect to eat in a 'chop chop' fast manner aka like 'order, eat, pay thank you mam' style.",

Had the Chocolate & Hazelnut for desert. Again, very good.The prices really are affordable, thought the serving sizes do suffer somewhat. Went with the chicken cause from what I've seen of the food served on tables beside us if I went with anything else I, an average sized man, would leave the place hungry.The place is in a good location that is convenient and accessible. Poor service though. Ordering using a paper sheet? Had to ask for a couple of waters. Server brought them over by grabbing them wholesale by the top. Asked for other ones that weren't touched that way, the server shot me a look that basically said 'how else am I supposed to carry them?'. The persistent non-usage of trays by servers in Singapore continues to baffle me. No fresh cutlery between courses. Used the single napkin (that the cutlery usually sits upon when the table is set) provided to put in my lap. When clearing the first course, the server put the dirty cutlery out of my plate and directly onto the table.In all fairness, the food did come quickly though. They were out of about 75% of their wines by the glass on the evening we were there? The ones they did have were reasonably good though. Mixed bag this place is.",

Definitely not recommended if u are bringing children. Other than that the food is decent and the price is reasonable. If you don't get your food within 20min be sure to ask else u might not get it at all. Service standard is not great but understandable due to the large crowd and the fact that most waiter/waitress are part-timers. Recommend the duck confit, foie gras and lava cake (which I remember is only served at this joint). Enjoy.",

Haha.I find the servings really small, that's how they keep their pricing low I supposed. The foie gras came in hardly more than two bite size. Ok, it is less than $10, but if you size it up the normal restaurant size, it is not that much cheaper than the other places.Two of us ended up eating two appetizers, two main course and two desserts. It didn't end up being a very cheap affair ultimately. Good effort by local young people who graduated from our own Shatec though. I wish them the best.",

    "text": "Guess how I found out about this place? Ding, ding! Time's up. Here's the answer. I got attracted by the long queue while crossing the road to Bugis. No. Seriously. That was precisely how I found out about Saveur. I was like \"WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THAT QUEUE?\" And I dragged my poor boyfriend over to the crowd. French food? Pfft.. that doesn't explain the queue. Then I saw the menu... and everything became crystal clear. Duck Confit for $10+?! Are my eyes deceiving me? I googled. Nope, it's true. It's actually.... affordable? Affordable + French food somehow does not click.. but Saveur made sure it did. After a few unsuccessful attempts at trying to get in (and eventually resigning to a certain Golden Arch fast food nearby for a meal), the boyfriend and I did the unimaginable. We went to Saveur HALF AN HOUR before opening hours to ensure we get in. And we finally did. So was the food worth the hype? Here was what we ordered. The Foie Gras (now don't go thinkin' animal cruelty and all that.. it's not everyday I'm getting foie gras at less than $10) with lentils was salty... yes. That was it. Salty. But at less than $10.. I'm not complaining. I'll only be pissed if it was going for $50. What you pay for is what you will get. After that, my duck confit came. Ok, granted, it was on the smallish side.. but like what I mentioned before... the price. The taste of it? For someone like me who hates the taste of duck, I polished it off right down to the bone, so I'll say it's swell.Then the dessert of blood orange jelly came. Again, it was on the small side. One bite into it.... I swear, if it wasn't indecent, I would have orgasm on the spot. What on earth.... the taste. To me it was orgasmic. A definite must try. All in all, was the food worth the hype? The taste.. I'll say it's average. But the price? Yes. It's definitely worth the hype if you are looking to go on a budget. Just remember though, what you pay for is what you will get, so don't be expecting too much from this place.",
