    "text": "it is the weekend! which means it is brunch - and here is a good place to get a decent one, even if more than a little far out. this rustic little cafe is unpretentious (pretty rare in the recent crop of cafes), and it serves up an averagely-decent brunch menu that spans american brunch classics to local delights.most of us started off on the western side of the menu - mostly average fixins' - their poached eggs are probably the most notable thing on the menu.they make an appearance in most of the breakfast dishes, and each is a neat parcel of cooked white and flowing yolk - good execution, but it might have helped more if the sauces and flavors had just as much care.the local specialties were rather a hit-and-miss. a hit with a very lemak mee siam that was served with a poached egg - you will want to eat this hot because it quickly loses its charm as it cools - and a terrible miss with the nasi lemak, which came with another one of those poached eggs. the rice had barely any flavor, the chicken impressive-looking but barely seasoned and a tad dry - this dish was pretty dismal.I also think that poached egg on the rice smacks a little of trying-too-hard - there's something to be said about the texture of a golden fried egg with a runny yolk and the texture it brings to the dish.but I got pretty lucky with my main of grilled saba (mackerel) drizzled with a sticky soy glaze on baby spinach. definitely not the sort of thing I expected in this sort of place, but nothing to complain about since it worked very well. the mackerel was oily and savory, the baby spinach crisp and green, and that glaze a sweet-savory counterpoint.it works for this place that its kitschy, in a good almost-believably-local way, without any of the pretentiousness in the hipster-hangouts we see these days. the food is decent, though not quite worth traveling for without a car - I suggest it only if driving and looking for a cute little place to sit on the weekend.",

Business is quite good during lunch time and I would guess that most customers specially make their way here. Since it's not in a mall or upscale location, I expected the prices to be lower but it was comparable to mid range restaurants. I had duck confit which was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I would have preferred it to come with a less creamy sauce. Portion and taste are fine so if you are tired of chain restaurants, give this a chance!",

It looked so cute and bloo!!! :) i had heard great comments about their cakes so I decided to try their rainbow cake at $6.80+ it's reasonably priced even though.. Anyone who can bake will tell you that's still overpriced.. Nonetheless... The buttercream wasn't too buttery and the cake was light. The colours were pretty too :) we had a side of chicken wings which tasted and smelt just like the har jiong kai which you get at a tze char at 2 times more than what the tze char stall would charge you for.. Nonetheless I would recommend you to checkout other places for wings and you can def try their apple crumble pie :) delicious and a \u00a0generous serving with a dollop of ice cream! :)",

    "text": "i put off writing this review just to see if i still feel as strongly as i did, about this place, after a cooling off period.it's been more than a month now and i think it is safe to say i'm not clouded by any impulsive verbal diarrhoea.firstly, finding this place is a challenge.even for a former west sider junkie like me.fortunately, i was cabbing it and even though the taxi driver knew of the road, he still brought me on a tour of the colourfully named roads, kuning(yellow), merah(red) before arriving at puteh(white).if you are driving, your safest bet will be parking at clementi stadium.limited parking in front of w39 is available and if you do like to take a risk at parking illegally, do have a word with marcus before you do so.it was packed to the brim on an august saturday afternoon.thankfully, we secured a reservation and were seated within.decor was pleasant enough but i'm forever wary of style over substance.staff were not the most experienced but they tried.upon the recommendation of their staff and the fact the brunch menu exclaimed it as a local favourite! nasi lemak with roasted spice chicken leg, that was what i ordered.when it arrived, the fleeting moments of it's decent looks gave way to an inner flaw that is hard to overlook.salt or the lack thereof.yes, most times people complain about their food being overly salty but today the oldest, most ubiquitous food seasoning was missing?did someone forget about it?but not only was the coconut rice lacking in salt, the coconut milk was way watered down resulting in a tastelessly bland, overly wet and not so lemak rice.sure, you could ask for more of their homemade sambal but again that is mere window dressing.nasi lemak rice has to be palatable enough for you to eat it on it's own.next the chicken leg, best described as a powdery turmeric mess.again, did salt go AWOL?after just one bite, all you want is to wash it away with their decent coffee.mind you, their nasi lemak is priced at $12.50, so the benchmark should be set so much the higher, no?and guess what? they interestingly use nicely poached eggs for most of their dishes.but guess what, i'm not a fan of poached eggs!:(give me oily fried eggs with runny yolks, anytime, for my nasi lemak, please!seeing how i only recently scored me the maverick badge, here is a 2 star rating in hope you can score yours too!:)",

Cakes look pretty on the shelves that screams 'eat me'. so i did. ordered the rainbow cake and red velvet. remember how many say not to be just a pretty face but have substance? sadly this place just has a pretty face when it comes to dessert and coffee. i have to admit the sponge cake used in the rainbow and red velvet cake is light and not that sweet but the cream... OMG. tooooo sweet and too much. ordered a latte to go with me cakes but sadly I had better coffee. i'm not picky with my coffee and even I can say its meh... sooo for coffee lovers I would recommend you trying something else insteadi have to admit the service here is good and attentive. they just have to up a notch on the desserts and drinks to make this a good chill out place.i can't comment on the savories for i had none of it this time but I doubt i'll ever come back and try - looking at the reviews. however, this is a good place to come once and see the pretty cakes. overall, its a good attempt at a cafe but needs more work to reach memorable.

    "text": "New indie cafes and bistros are popping up around Singapore faster than ever before (oh my poor pocket), but this is actually a good thing - more options, more variety, more cool hangouts for the weekends :)Visited W39 last Saturday with some friends for a casual breakfast, and it was love at first step-in! Located at the far end of a stretch of shophouses near West Coast Road, the exterior of this cool little bistro reminded me of a summertime beach house. The decor theme is a mix of lemon yellow stripes against fresh whites and blues, full-pane glass doors and lots of windows - such a happy, inviting place, tucked just steps away from a quiet private residential neighbourhood.Indulge yourself with the shelves of magazines, little trinkets and nostalgic old-time snacks (think rabbit brand candy, and sour lemon!) as you wait for your food to be served. We were tempted by the seemingly popular Mee Siam, but somehow all ended up ordering the Hearty Breakfast or classic Eggs Ben (all great choices). The Hearty Breakfast was yummy and very well made, eggs were perfectly fried - runny on the sunny side, slightly charred on the other... the sausage and toasts were tasty, and served with arugula salad on the side. Happy patrons we were.I really love this place - service was warm, friendly and prompt. Food was good and not grossly overpriced, and it wasn't too packed for a Saturday either. Will certainly be back again :)Both indoor and outdoor seating available. Check out my photos.Oh, and they sell some baked goods such as bread loaves and cakes to-go too.",

    "text": "Drawn by the siren call of the Yelp Saturday Brunch Club, hordes of hungry hungry Yelpers descended on W39 for a good balance of 'ang moh' brunch options and some local choices. Now, I've have rated W39 3 stars. I enjoyed the mee siam although it was atypical (much too rich and creamy, though the poached egg was a fascinating take), and while it might not become my go-to place when I have a mee siam craving, I definitely wouldn't mind ordering it again. The Eggs Benedict was well put together, my only complaint is that it was TINY. I could have had three of 'em. The Honey Lemon was way way too sweet, but once the ice started melting, it wasn't so bad.BUT. For everyone else at the table, I could tell that W39 felt a lot more 2-starry than 3. (And if you'll refer to Jerilyn's review, you'll get further evidence why.)The Nasi Lemak that one of the other Yelpers ordered was... very underwhelming and the small size of the Hearty Breakfast, well okay it wasn't small, just not HEARTY (full caps intended). The rice for the nasi lemak was under seasoned and the paninis were awfully small. Small niggling issues here and there that really undercut the place standing out amongst the increasing number of brunchy cafes popping up in Singapore.My conclusion after our visit? An Eggs Benedict and Mee Siam are just enough to feed one, and if that's all you order, you'll have a pretty good meal.If you stray off that path that I have painstakingly cleared for you though, don't blame me when you find yourself in a minefield of mediocrity.",

Sorry westies, you're not gonna be seeing more food posts from the western part of Singers.My Mocha tasted more like regular latte. Where is ze chocolate??! Meh-ish latte at best. Very diluted. Thankfully I've lowered my expectation so I wasn't overly disappointed. Don't go expecting anything artisan.Hearty Breakfast ($13.50) is a greedy and lazy girl's best option. Well, first and foremost, it has everything. It's quite hard to screw up an American breakfast since everything is kinda outsourced. The scrambled eggs were a little overdone for my liking. The best part was the toast (i think it's brioche) with its airy texture. Salted butter would be welcomed anytime. I originally opted for a Brie Parma Ham Panini (or was it a Croque Madame) but i was tempted by the Braised Pork Cheeks Gruyere Panini (S$13) that the neighboring table ordered. The mouthwatering scent was too good that i had to change my order immediately! Boy was I glad i did!The panini was stellar with the slightly crusty shell and dense and moist center. Pork cheeks were tender and flavorful and the sandwich had a perfect meat-gravy-bread ratio. The taste of the meat was rather strong but i'm a carnivore so i don't care. Besides, it was balanced by the savory gravy and the light sweetness of the bread.If you're looking for something lighter, the assortment of cakes, breads and pastries should not disappoint (i base that on my review of their breads).",

    "text": "Have been hearing quite a bit about this place but have been feeling lazy to trek down to the West to try it out. Well, finally I did and I wasn't disappointed at all.Was a short bus ride away from Clementi or JE MRT Station. On first sight, the place reminded me of my area at Serangoon Gardens with the cafe nestled snugly among \u00a0residential houses. Was quite crowded on a rainy Sunday evening where most people were there for dinner; isn't it a testament to how good a place is if it is filled on a raining Sunday evening? The interior was filled to the brim and so was the exterior.We weren't there for dinner but vowed to try their mains the next time around as it looked so good from what we saw at our neighboring diners' tables. Ordered a chocolate cake (forgotten the exact name but have a look at my picture) and the texture was gooey, melty and is a chocolate maven's piece of heaven - a must try. The coffee wasn't the best but was passable.Loved the atmosphere! Wished I knew of this place while I was at NUS as it would definitely be on my hang-out list!",

    "text": "Heard about the crowd here on weekends so I was a little concerned about coming here on a Sunday night. The place wasn't too hard to find from the nearby bus stop (you might have parking problems if you're driving though!) and the ambience was decent. There are lots of nostalgic stuff laid all over the place which makes the overall ambience quite cosy - albeit a little forced, as another Yelper mentioned in his review. Having gone down mainly for dessert. A friend and I ordered a flat white, the crunchie hazelnut and a tiramisu to share among us. I take pride in my coffee and I can honestly say the flat white was nothing special - a little too flat (pun unintended) actually. The crunchie hazelnut and the tiramisu looked great and I thought it would at least make up for the disappointing coffee. I was wrong. The crunchie hazelnut had an overwhelming taste of fresh cream that made it far too sweet for both our tastes. The tiramisu came with a serving of espresso - which was something I had never seen before, and for good reason. Without the espresso, the tiramisu tasted entirely of marscapone. Even with the espresso poured in, it still felt pretty... off. I couldnt taste any kahlua liqour in the tiramisu with or without the espresso, which to me, sealed the deal as one of the poorest tiramisus I've had. If you want a good tiramisu, try out Kith Cafe at Park Mall - it's far better. The place was also quite noisy, so if you're looking for a quiet place to hang out with friends or loved ones, take note. I didnt try any of the food items, but the lamb ribs and wagyu burgers other people were eating looked quite appetitizing. \u00a0But then again, so were the desserts we ordered.Not coming back to this place again. At least the service here was something worth mentioning.",

    "text": "Came here with the Singapore Yelp Brunch Club and while I loved meeting fellow yelpers, W39 was well, ehhhh. It's 2.5 stars (but not quite 3) in my opinion. Let's just say, the concept is good but the execution just well, kinda sucked, for lack of a better word.Food: I got the Hearty Breakfast, and wasn't the least impressed (especially because I was at Arbite the weekend before, and they, they do a mean hearty breakfast - but more on that in another review!) the portions in general just seemed small all around (except for the local options) which would be fine if it tasted amazing but everything just seemed subpar. I also tried bites of the Mee Siam and the Ham & Cheese Panini. The Ham & Cheese Panini definitely tasted kind of like something I could've done myself, however, the Mee Siam was probably the best thing there in my opinion. It was hearty, with a nice sweet flavor to it. I enjoyed that the most. We also got the Honey Lemon Ice Tea which tasted like someone spilled half the jar of honey into. Did they?! Ambience: Like I said, great concept, horrible execution. They try to be \"cute\" with the cute nautical theme and selling old candies we grew up with but it just seems kind of copied. The seating inside is limited and pretty cramped and the service was alright. All in all, we left happy to have met everyone but not so happy with the food. Not horrible but really nothing special.",

But not a place I would return to.The service was earnest and polite but quite inefficient. Granted that I did not try the food, I really cannot comment on any dish in particular. But when I checked out what the other diners were having, none of them screamed or even said 'EAT ME!!!' And the coffee was decent but really not worth the fifteen minute wait for it.But if you are bent on trying an average brunch place, it could be wise to reserve a table, as W39 was quite crowded on a Saturday afternoon.",
