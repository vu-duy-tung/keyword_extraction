    "text": "I often go to bergs gourmet burgers whenever I am craving a good burger. I think what makes this burger joint stand above the rest are their sauces (bergs sauce and garlic aioli). Their signature sauce tasted like brown sauce and barbeque sauce and gave a really nice sweet and smokey flavor to the burger and the garlic aioli is creamy and garlicky. The fried are also another highlight as they were thick-cut, crispy and perfectly cooked. However, the burger is often sinewy and not as tender.",

When we asked the server about it, they said the burgers are \"pre-cooked\" and it is too difficult to fully cook the burgers. The chicken (mini) burgers tasted much better and the fries arrived hot. No A/C and not very busy.",

The staff is quite friendly and takes my order from my table without me going to the counter. Payment is made after having the meal.PORTO POLO (BERG $14.5/Small $11.5)Grilled Chicken in Spicy Portuguese Marinade, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion, Cheddar Cheese, Homemade Peri-Peri Sauce & Aioli.Through the staff's recommendation, I order this burger. It looks huge. It tastes quite spicy and the patty is a bit dry to me. I could not finish it although I have not eaten whole day.BERGS Homemade Lemonade ($4)The lemonade is quite refreshing. Just nice to cool down during a hot afternoon.Overall the food is not bad. Service is great. There is no much crowd around during the sunday afternoon.",

    "text": "For me, this place is above average because of the size of the burgers. But tastewise, I'd give it slightly above average. It wasn't excellent because the beef patty just wasn't all that great. It's hard to describe, the texture to me seemed dry and \"rubbery\". Could be that it's a leaner cut of beef. I like the Bergs sauce, which I can best describe as a teriyaki, BBQ, onion blended glaze. The Haji Land location is one of three with the other two located in Amoy St. & East Coast Road. Note: operating day/hours vary by location. Beer and wine on the menu too. Be warned, their Bergs-sized burgers are huge!",

I ordered the Crikey Too (it had beetroot in it and I didn't know it would compliment the beef patty that good) while my sister ordered the Miss Piggy. The burgers are huge and definitely worth every penny.The location is great, the staff are friendly and they serve alcoholic beverages too. The mac and cheese bombs are amazing and is highly recommended! Overall stay was wonderful. Will definitely come back.",

    "text": "Gave Bergs another shot, this time at the Arab Street venue. Nice and cozy little hole in the wall on a bustling and touristy Arab Street.Our burgers were tasty and well done, definitely hit the spot for our burger craving.There's a $4 option to add chips to your burger along with a drink (ice lemon tea or lemonade). Both drinks are ultra-sugary but the lemonade a little less so.Bergs beef burger patties have a unique seasoning that I can't quite pinpoint. It's not your typical burger but it's tasty nonetheless.Other pluses to eating at Bergs - they have a washroom stocked with nice paper towels to dry your hands which is loads better than using a hawker washroom only to come out with dripping wet hands b/c a certain someone hasn't picked up the habit of carrying around a hanky or tissues.They also have napkins here that they give out generously, another plus for the reason stated above.It's not gourmet but I'm easy to please. Napkins and a place to sit? You're good in my books!",

    "text": "Nice location and concept. Like another reviewer, I found the Miss Piggy burger disappointing. Presentation was nice and the fries were good, but the meat was quite dry and flavorless (frozen?) despite being ordered medium-rare. As noted by the other reviewer, the sauce was really too sweet (but not in a nice bbq sauce way). To top it off, the tomatoes were white and flavorless. A place that calls their burgers \"gourmet\" needs to source only top quality.....So, 30% better than a Big Mac and 200% more expensive.",

    "text": "checked out this place on a 3pm on a saturday. awesome location at haji lane, perfect for people watching if you sit outside. inside, it had a really chill feel and is a nice spot to meet up with a group of friends for some beer and rowdy catch-up. noticed that they have a happy hour from 5-8, where beer bottles go as low as $6, so i can see it doing just that. the menu was pretty interesting and they had a number of decent veggie options. burgers come in two sizes; small and burgs (big) and hover around $10-$15 bucks, with the option of chips and a drink for +$4. they even offer a 3 (mini) burger sample for $15, for the indecisive lot. i went with the bergs miss piggy ($14.50, beef pattie, bacon, lettuce, tomato, red onion, aioli, bergs sauce & edam cheese) and was quite excited to sink in since it looked pretty damn good. sadly, i was underwhelmed. the meat was totally anemic and lacked a nice chew and sauce was SO sweet. like i get sweet bbq sauce, but this was just kind of ick. also, the bacon tasted kind of weird. i mean, i finished the thing, but i definitely would not be back for another, unless one of their veggie burgers fares a lot better. the only redeeming thing was how if you join their fanclub on facebook, they'll knock 15% off your bill. but i guess, for that price, i was hoping for something better.",

By awesome Aussie, I mean thick patties, hamburger buns don't fall apart, and the toppings are very good. \u00a0It's a fun place where the menu is interesting and they server burgers in paper bags rather than plates. Kind of different. I got the Bailout Burger, which is a Greek burger with feta cheese. You can get a lamb burger, burgers with bacon and pineapple, and if you don't like what's on their menu, you can add whatever toppings you want. They have very thick steak fries.The place is open to the outside, so there's no aircon. They served us free water, always a plus. Prices are inclusive of GST, so it's quite reasonable.",
