Kudos to a biz/owner that can be bothered with customer feedback. \u00a0Really do appreciate the boss taking the initiative to engage the customer and for that not only he won back a loyal customer and i am sure i shall be spreading the Wolf Gospel so to speak - thank you.Sep 29th '18Checked in again for the usual Double and Shroom with Sweet potatoe fries. \u00a0 Glad to report all good.",

This place is in a food court and was super crowded on a Thursday evening -- took a while to find a table. Also it took about 30 minutes for my burger to be ready after ordering. The staff were trying their best but it was really slammed.",

    "text": "What a fun burger place at Suntec's Pasarbella!I came in wanting to try their signature Wolf Burger, but the staff was very good in convincing me to their their Alpha burger, which is their take on a double cheeseburger. Apparently they use a completely different beef for it, which could be why it's higher priced.I wish I could've had my burger done medium, but I went for well-done just for pregnancy precautions (I know... I know...)The burger itself was still very good; juicy and filling (after all, I was eating 2 patties; one for me, one for baby!) I'm pretty sure it'd be better if you order it medium!Unfortunately the sweet potato fries were a miss. They tasted good, but they were either overcooked or not fresh, as there was no crispness in the fry. Maybe it's best to just stick to their regular fries, more turnover = fresher?",

It was a little hard to find but once we followed other reviews that said it's located inside a little food court type place, we found it. Lots of other food options in the same food court--drinks, ice cream, coffee, other main meals. The burgers were good though nothing special, but the truffle Parmesan fries were delicious and so were the sweet potato fries. We also got a chocolate shake but weren't digging the crumbled malt balls on top.",

Kimchi fries were not so good though. The fries were thin and airy (i guess it's the generic frozen kind) and the sauce was average.",

    "text": "Came across Wolf Burgers at Pasarbella on a day I was meant to have a salad. I have no regrets on this one. I never say No to a burger experience. Prices are very reasonable.The Wolf was my first try and what made me fall in love with first bite. They suggested to go with Medium rare which makes the patty a melt-in-your-mouth-experience. The combination of the beef juices, cheddar cheese and caramelised onions all soaking the bun, makes it one of my favourite burgers in Singapore. Your hands will get messy, so make sure to have napkins on hand. Tried the Buttermilk Fried Chicken on another occasion. The salted egg mayo and homemade slaw makes all the difference and what puts it above other chicken type burgers I've had from other joints. I can't fully describe this as you have to try it to be the judge. Side of sweet potato fries never goes wrong, but I've always struggled to finish it cos the burgers make me 3/4 full. Staff is friendly. Price is reasonable. Even if Pasarbella is crowded, if you have patience...wait til you get a table, otherwise, have it to go.",

Their basic burger is not too bad, but it really can't beat their mushroom one. The salted egg yolk butter milk fried chicken isn't too bad either, but not really super salted egg yolks.",
