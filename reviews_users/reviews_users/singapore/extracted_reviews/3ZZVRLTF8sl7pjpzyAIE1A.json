    "text": "I've been coming here for years for my soba fix since it was the very first place to offer fresh handmade soba in Singapore. Over the years, I think the soba quality has dipped a little bit but it's still pretty good overall so I often come back.They have an extremely extensive menu ranging from cold to warm soba options, set menus and lunch specials. All this on top of their seasonal menu that showcases ingredients that are well-loved during those seasons in Japan.I've always enjoyed their duck soba but recently I had the vegetable yuba soba in warm broth which was amazing. Their dashi quality might also have dipped a little but it's still delicious! And if you order the cold soba, it's always great to have the soba-yu given to you at the end of the meal so you can have some broth to drink.While I'm a fan of their soba, I think their sides range from passable to not bad. Some are better than others but in general I would say... Just order what you like! You can't ever go wrong that way.",

The unagi is ok, but nothing as healthy-looking or appetizing as suggested by the photo on the menu. The dipping sauce is over salty. In the old days, they used to give you boiling water to add to the sauce and finish it off. Not any more - cost cutting? At meal times, the cramped place is full, and it's hard to get the attention of the overwhelmed staff. Soba So Good is like its neighbor So Ph So Good - both are quite mediocre.",

    "text": "If they would allow substitutions, this would be five stars.First I asked for the saba warm soba, and they were out of it. Then I asked if I could get warm soba with yakiniku beef but not with the egg and fish cake, and the server had to go ask if that was possible (it wasn't). I ended up having the most basic warm ramen (kake) and the wagyu beef. Both were great. This is probably the best soba in Singapore.I also wanted to order more spring onions, but the pricing structure in the menu, such as $5 for extra sauce, suggested it probably wouldn't be worth whatever they would charge.",

I like it here a lot but find it very inconsistent every time I go back but know I will be back again.I always get their cold miso soba noodles. The noodles themselves are excellent and I always scarf those down very quickly (even ordered a second set one time). It's the miso that changes flavor every time and I'm not sure why. Still a lot of fun to figure out how much miso you'd want to mix in with your noodles.Then afterwards, you can use the hot rice water to mix with your miso paste/soy mixture and drink the combined soup. Very good!Also not the biggest fan of how they tend to run out of items like their special ice cream and one of their other tea drinks.Highly recommend if you are looking for fresh soba noodles. Not even sure if you can find this anywhere around Singapore.",

    "text": "I'm torn when it comes to choosing between soba and ramen, but if I had to choose, I guess it would have to be soba as I find it's not as 'heavy' as ramen.And one of the best places to have very good and authentic soba is at Shimbashi. All of the noodles are handmade here at Shimbashi and are as fresh as soba noodles can be. There's a choice of hot or cold, and a combination that has both. Personally, I find the cold soba noodles a much better option as they retain the springiness when you bite down on them. While they do have bento sets on offer as well, I'd recommend you give them a miss as they're specialists in soba and if you wanted to haven bentos, then you probably should have gone somewhere else instead!",
