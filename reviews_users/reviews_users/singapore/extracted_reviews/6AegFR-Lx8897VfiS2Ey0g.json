Be sure to go upstairs to check out the Apothecary - a unique, little room that serves even more unique cocktails! We had Corpse Effect, Tortured Tommy and White Polish and all were delicious. The rooftop bar is also very cool. Definitely a destination if you are in the mood for something different and want to be adventurous with your cocktails (although they have standard drinks, too).",

Definitely be sure to climb the stairs all the way to the rooftop to check it out. \u00a0On the first floor and roof top enjoy bar food and drinks. \u00a0For the dining room and full food menu go to the second floor (reservations a must!). \u00a0The third floor is home to a private events space. \u00a0I had many roof top dining experiences in Singapore, and this one was the most cozy. \u00a0Their rooftop is home to a herb garden that they use for food and cocktails. \u00a0Creating a green and natural setting. \u00a0It's a small space, and popular. \u00a0We slowly went from a cramped corner to a more spacious table once it opened up. \u00a0On a hot summer evening, they kept the space breezy and tolerable with fans. \u00a0They have a great selection of gin drinks. \u00a0If you are with a group of friends the gin bathtub is a must! \u00a0It is perfect for four people. The cocktail is literally served in a small clawed porcelain tub with four straws. \u00a0It is well balanced, refreshing, and full of cucumber and herb flavors. \u00a0One of the best drinks I had in Singapore. \u00a0Their fries are also very addictive! \u00a0Beware!",

    "text": "Contrary to the other reviewers who went to the first floor, I went to the dining area on the second floor and had a much better (and pricier) experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed.We had the scallops and pig's head for appetizers, of which I highly recommend the pig's head, which came with an apple sauce. Pork and apple always go well together so you can't go wrong with that.We then had duck breast and seabass for mains. The duck breast was done exactly the way I asked for (medium rare), \u00a0and it was moist with a delish sauce and bacon. The seabass was moist and good, nothing special.We didn't order desserts because they had a very limited selection (just three), and nothing caught our fancy so we hopped off to another place for desserts.Everyone recommends the gin and tonics, and after I sipped one, it was no surprise why. They brew their gin in-house and use a local mix of spices. I think it was worth every penny.I recommend coming here on a Friday night, only if you have a booking, because it gets crowded pretty quickly. You should probably move somewhere else in the area for desserts (I recommend Senso). I also think if you have dinner here then expect to spend more than what you normally would for the first floor area, as I reckon the bill was about $200+for two appetizers, two mains, 4 drinks, no desserts.",

    "text": "This bar/restaurant on Ann Siang Hill/ Club Street is a bit of a strange one in that I am not sure what they are going for. Are they trying to be a restaurant, bar or club. When I have been there the music has been a bit too loud for my liking but there is still no area for people who want to dance and they close early. They do also offer something that seems like British pub food but have not sampled any of it so cannot comment on it.For drinks they do offer a decent range of beers on tap and by bottle but nothing really excites. They have some of the cocktails pre/mixed on tap which does not really send a quality message and it also put everyone in our group off from ordering any cocktails. On the occasions I have been here we have come fairly late so it has seemed as if everyone working is more or less waiting to go home so service has not really been inviting but also not bad as such. The place is actually not that bad it just fails to excite but if other places in the area are full I have no problem grabbing a drink here but I would probably never plan to go here specifically.",

You heard right. Here they serve up G&T's from a wall dispenser, along with other cocktails, wine and beer. It's genius and makes for super fast service and a consistent blend of gin to tonic goodness. My only gripe? How does it cost $14!? for something that has practically no labour involved?",

Like mine fluffy and lighter. The roasted potatoes more than made up for itThe lamb was good. The beef was ok but not the best around. \u00a0My last sunday afternoon visit to this restaurant a year ago had roast beef but they had taken it out of the menu. Frankly that was better.As today was the National Day weekend, the local Singapore chef offered a selection of local Singapore tapas. Great selection. On the regular menu, the salt and pepper squid should not be missed. So is the seaweed fries.Lovely atmosphere. Great location in this part of Singapore too",

    "text": "could-be-fantastic but falls-short-of-the-mark british cooking at this small restaurant in the club street stretch of eateries. I know there are people scoffing at the whole \"british cooking\" idea, but I think that's a rather antiquated idea - it is possibly beyond doubt that it used to mean rather plain boiled meat alongside overboiled greens, but these days I would more readily associate it with a polished-up version of rustic comfort food.which - I suspect - is where this place was heading for, but I'm not sure it succeeded.let's just start with how gorgeous this place in. friday night, the first floor bar was filled with a boisterous crowd of expats celebrating the end of the week, while we blindly made our way up the stairs (on a pure guess, because there were no staff around to guide us) trying to locate the restaurant - behind a white door on the second floor, if you're wondering.when you walk into the door, it feels rather like you've stepped into a restaurant in london - and for that my expectations and spirits rose.we started with a complimentary platter of carb - slices of rather common hole-y bread and a yorkshire pudding (interesting at least for rarity if not so much for taste), served alongside butter and garlic mashed in too-much oil .it's a small menu of mains, rather pricey - and when it arrives, it barely feels worth it. the food is admittedly well-cooked: the chicken has a delicious skin and tender, moist meat (but very small and the ratio of meat to bone is pretty much half-half), and the skate-wing was also well-seasoned and simply seared for easily-flaked flesh.served on a big white plate, you order your own sides to round out your dishes - but I mean, come on. that's a huge lot of white space, incredibly unappetising and miserly, to say the least - and distasteful despite the otherwise-satisfying flavors.so while the food is decent, the place nostalgia-inducing and incredibly beautiful in my eyes, the prices not terribly unusual amongst the restaurants of its class - I doubt I'll be returning. there's better value to be got elsewhere, and at the very end of it, these simple dishes I can cook up myself.",

The music is too loud for a conversation but not loud enough to lift the mood. The makeshift alfresco area out on Club St is totally packed with punters. And what the hell is with the taps? I mean serving Cuba LIbres and Gin Tonics on tap? Seriously?Time Out (bless them) helps shed some light: \"focused on the seemingly contradictory concept of delivering quality cocktails at a rapid pace at Oxwell's bar, Whearty has opted to have his gin and tonic and cocktails priced from $12, dispensed from taps on the bar's walls.\"Oh... so it's about speed? Why the hell did it take 15 minutes for me to get a drink while a confused service team tried to organise weary punters at a chaotic bar? $12 is cheap, no doubt, but it isn't efficient and it tastes pretty terrible.Let's hope this place gets its act together in the coming months. Otherwise, it's just another totally average cookie-cutter Club St establishment.At least they have Monkey Shoulder.",

    "text": "With so many bars and restaurants on Club St/Ann Siang Hill, what sets Oxwell & Co. apart?Well, the mixed cocktails on tap, like gin & tonics and Cuba libres (which I learned was the fancy name for rum & coke) seem to pique people's interest. They also have their own brew from local brewery Jungle Beer, called the Oxhorn. According to our server, it's a nutmeg ale, which to me seems pretty neat. However, after hearing mixed reviews of these cocktails on tap, and the constant reminder that I'm on a \"diet\" (read: I've somehow associated beer with excessive calories I can't afford) I've only managed to have their house pinot noir each time I've visited.I've also only hung out on the ground level here, where they serve bar bites. Apparently there's a dining area on the 2nd floor where they serve a full menu, but I've always come at an hour when seating is not available.The ground level has a hipster vibe, with its white tile walls and fancy lights that you see in all the cool bars nowadays. I also liked how the taps for the beer, cocktails, and water were built into the wall. As for the music, it was pretty... interesting. They were playing loud gangsta rap, which didn't seem to fit the ambiance. I liked it because I'm ghetto like that, but at the same time it was a bit overpowering and our table of six really had to raise our voices to hear each other. At one point, a group of people at the bar kept staring at us because we were \"loud\", but sorry we're not sorry- it's a frikken bar on Friday night! This is not the National Library!Overall, an A-OK place to hang out, not outstanding, but not horrible, either.",

They pluck fresh nutmeg leaves from their garden, and their gin and tonics has a splash of that nutmeg flavor in it that sets them aside from the normal ones. I am not even a fan of gin and tonics and I find myself ordering one after another. Sometimes, the devil is in the details, and that subtle addition of nutmeg just really does wonders to improve the drink. Otherwise, they have all the works of a standard bar. I like it that they have snacks that's not bad tasting, and the general open layout of the place. And that it's relatively quiet compared to a lot of other bars. A good place to catch up with a friend, if you're feeling for something not too fancy.",
