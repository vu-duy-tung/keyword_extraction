    "text": "Great healthy food! Basil chicken is Soo good even though it's really simple and looks as if it's tasteless, but it's not, not at all. Been ordering their basil chicken takeaway for 3 times cos it's that good, for a 'healthy Meal'. Go for the coriander lime sauce and garlic chilli, am in love. Ordered their set meal @ $14.90 which comes with a snack (banana bread) and drink (got a coconut water). For the snack, if U're sugar conscious, u might not wanna have the Apple muesli bar as it's kinda sweet which defeats the purpose of a 'healthy diet'. Go for the banana bread, not as sweet as the Apple muesli yet tasty.If you're thinking of adding on some dessert, wouldn't recommend their a\u00e7ai sorbet as it has that \u00a0about-to-turn-bad taste unlike fresh a\u00e7ai from other outlets. Also, it's kinda sweet.I would highly recommend YOLO if U're searching for a healthy, tasty diet option! Their meals are suitable for halal/vegatarian consumer as well. Fuss free too. Delivery from food panda/Deliveroo has been fuss free for me. This is definitely one of my to-go-to diet option especially if I'm looking to build up some muscles and cut on some fats. Lean bod here I come!",

Food was decent but production was very slow and service was subpar. For similar price I would choose to go to Daily Cut or Grain Traders, both of which are located within walking distance.",

    "text": "Ordered delivery via ubereats, and was quite disappointed. They forgot the sauce for one of our meals, and gave the wrong main protein as well (friend ordered the Salmon quinoa patty but was given Salmon instead). Was also unpleasantly surprised at the lack of consistency when it came to drinks - one cup was only about half full, while the other was 3/4 full. Both were tightly wrapped so nothing was spilt in transport. Also, don't try the Tropical Boost - tastes very odd. Go with the Peanut Butter Chocolate instead, that was tasty.",

There was a brief period I saw the kopitiam in NUH show the calories on a few of the \"healthier\" items but then they took them off because no one was probably reading it anyways. \u00a0YOLO is a really great concept. They focus on healthy ingredients and healthy eating. Eating with keeping in mind what youre putting into your body. Keeping track of the protein, glycemic index, etc. Its really one of the only places Ive seen with this in mind. \u00a0The food is relatively cheap and pretty good. Its fast, well organized and the staff are very nice and friendly. \u00a0Some of the dishes arent AMAZING or anything but most the food is tasty and satisfying. A good place for a quick healthy meal. \u00a0Its a regular stop for me after hitting the gym. Definitely recommend it.",

I wasn't in the area of the restaurant, so I ordered through Food Panda and had them deliver. I got the cauliflower fried rice with chicken and the beef steak with sweet potato mash. Both were very good and delivery was very fast, with food at the door in about thirty minutes. The food is simple and healthy. If you're not training, you might find it a bit bland, but it's a pretty easy fix to add your own seasoning if you need more. Now I just need to actually make a visit to the restaurant!",

I think they're headed in the right direction!",
