Jumped off the MRT and despite the madness and mayhem of busy Somerset 313 and its surrounding malls, we were able to get a table after a short wait. This was a plus as I don't do long waits. There is not a lot of ambience here with the hustle and flow of the passing throng. However, it is made up for by a fantastic selection of beers from Japan. Some by bigger breweries and some by tiny craft breweries that I had neither seen or heard of previously. Japanese bar food was available on the menu, and the Yakitori and fried chicken was a welcome addition to the beers.",

There's a long extensive menu with a lot of interesting beers from Japan. Some are very traditional beers (i.e. there's nothing special - although they're good) but there are some that are truly unique. A beer brewed from rice? You can't tell me you've tried that anywhere else!It's in a great location as well, great patio in a busy neighbourhood that's easily accessible. \u00a0Beers are about $13 a bottle from what I remember, and I think they have specials as well.

The Hitachino Nest ales were also tasty, and have the cutest owl logo.Food was decent - I wouldn't order the kaarage chicken again cause it was rather fatty for my liking, but we ordered the Hibiki set (12 yakitori sticks!) that was pretty filling for my party of 4. Interesting black peppery sauce it came with. We also ordered the Mozarella-Tomato yakitori, and I liked the mozarella.I like the ambience of the place in the sheltered outdoor area of 313, it's been raining so it was nice and cool and not too crowded or loud so conversation was easy.",

I am no Japanese beer connoisseur but they had quite a selection (and a great HH price for Asahi for beer newbies like me!).They have an extensive beer menu and while its not the cheapest, you can find all kinds of interesting niche craft beers. They also have quite a large food menu. They say they're known for their yakitori, which I didn't have a chance to try. We ordered off of the lunch menu, which is in the $15 range and includes a full set of soup with a salad. I had their curry rice with karaage chicken and it was the best curry rice I've had in the city so far.As far as I could tell, they only had outdoor seating so it might not be the best place when it is pouring outside or if you need to cool off from the heat. Still, its nice and breezy and it allows you to do a good bit of people-watching. It is located right outside of the western entrance to the Somerset313 building, next to the German restaurant.",

I have explored some of these beers while in Japan but the craft beer trend was jot as strong when I was there so many of the ones on offer here were new to me. They are also thoroughly described in the beer list and the staff are knowledgeable so really impressed by that. Prices are perhaps a bit on the steep side but the happy hour is pretty good (at least if before 6pm).They also have some Japanese whiskey and sake as well as some beer from other countries and some ciders so most people should be able to find something to drink here. Of course they also serve food and it is good and simple Japanese food. I sampled several of the dishes and it is good solid Japanese food, my favorite was the curry but I would not come for the food but rather the beer selection and I may or may not have some food. The locations is central, right by Somerset tube in the mall 313@Somerset.",

Just wish they have 3 oz samplers options or I should get more people to come drinking with me next time! Come before 6 pm for the best deal $10 VS $15 after 8 pm!! I should have started drinking much much early! You know who can resist specials?I am dreaming of a taste of Hitachino Nest XH (8%) A robust Belgian style Brown Ale made with extra malt and hops and matured in Shochu casks for over 6 months.

I'm usually an instant fan and seeing a review of such places below 4 stars usually means I've finally become annoyed enough to provide feedback via a review.It's definitely not my first time here but my previous experiences did not have service issues because I happened to be there during off-peak \"happy hour\" before the main crowd comes in. While it was far from packed tonight, the lapse in service became quite evident.I stopped by with Gold Elite Nik T. and Sweet Elite Linda L. for a beer and a good conversation after our dinner with Cindy L. and Ning.*******10 minutes to get our order in.5 minutes for Linda L. to receive her order.15 minutes of chatting without anything else arriving.5 minutes before we got someone's attention and to find out that they RAN OUT of our orders...and we were never informed about it.Nik T. looked at his watch and decided to downsize from 500 ml to 300 ml. We both ordered something else that they said was available.15 minutes of chatting without anything else arriving.5 minutes before we got someone's attention again and NOW found out that they CAN'T serve the new draft due to fizzy issues with the keg...and offered a ton of apologies.Nik T. downsized all the way and decided to go dry while I finally settled for the same drink as Linda L. It arrived in less than 5 minutes.Linda L.'s drink became warm while she waited for ours to arrive. Nik T. ended up leaving with just a sip of hers. I ended up having one instead of going dry like Nik T. so that Linda L. didn't end up having a brew herself.BUT WAIT...if that wasn't enough to end the night, our bill...was wrong. We were billed for our initial order. Gold Elite couldn't take it anymore...and gave immediate feedback. I just smiled...said it was okay...and got ready to review this place.*******Thankfully, I waited a bit...and managed to justify in my mind that they deserved 3 stars at least for their product. But seriously, their staff needs some training yeah? This isn't a Kopitiam...and even then, Kopitiams don't pull this kind of crap.Yelp 100: 20/100",

    "text": "When seeing that there was a craft beer place in Singapore I had to try it. I was pretty disappointed with there Japanese craft beers. I had a sampler of 4 out of 5 different types, I didn't care for any of them. I then tried a Mocha Amaretto beer they had in a bottle, took about 3 sips then bought a different beverage. The last drink I tried was a mango Apple cider which was actually really refreshing being that it is only outdoor seating in Singapore weather. I tried the smoked duck breast(really bland), the Mochi cheese age( not bad when paired with duck breast), and the Curry croquettes. The curry croquettes are to die for, definitely would recommend them with the cider. All else I wound pass on.",

    "text": "JiBiru specializes in Japanese beers, and they have the most extensive selection I have seen outside of Japan. \u00a0Actually, even i Japan I'm not sure if there are many places that carry 60 Japanese craft beers in bottles plus 5 on draft. \u00a0Anyway, they have a sampler of 4 beers on draft (all from Hitachino) which is the way to go if you would like to try a few. \u00a0I'm not the biggest fan of HItachino though (except for their espresso stout), so for me it was just ok. \u00a0Their selection by the bottle was better though. \u00a0 I tried an Imperial IPA from Minoh, which was a great example of the style - strong, bitter, and full of flavor with an ABV of 9%. I could drink it all the time, except for the fact that it's so hot here, and that the pub is outdoors, with very little cooling. \u00a0They also carry some nice craft beers from the world including some of my faves (Rogue, La Trappe, etc) as well as sake, whiskey and shochu. \u00a0JiBiru also specializes in yakitori, and the chicken skewer I had was very tasty - perfectly cooked chicken with just the right amount of char and with a sauce that wasn't overly salty or sweet. \u00a0 The one thing that could improve here is the service though. \u00a0With the number of people working here, I found the service to be strangely inattentive or rather focused on one table only \u00a0Maybe they were celebs? \u00a0No idea, but in any case, JiBiru is a great place to see what Japanese craft breweries are doing these days with some tasty food to boot.",

They also have some local stuff (Jungle Beer, usually on draft), and on my last trip I noticed an improving selection of craft beer in bottles from Australia, Europe, and the U.S. Prices are reasonable: \u00a0normally $11-$15, but a little cheaper during their 2-tiered happy hour (before 6, and 6-8). It's also a nice, mellow, breezy place to chill out. In contrast, Brotzeit next door is always a little chaotic. Access is great for the MRT crowd. It's just a few steps outside of Somerset.",

    "text": "Ji-Biru offers a good range of Japanese imported beers. Some of these beers cannot even be found in the Japanese supermarkets around! One of our favorites is the chocolate bottled beer, but it comes in only seasonally. It has a really nice packaging, like what you expect to get on a Japanese beer. This little bar started along with the starting of the mall, and has since updated its menu with a good amount of food items, and expanded the choice of imported beer. This I think is a really good sign for any business, having business owners are willing to progress and make changes for the consumers. I guess they have figured out that Singaporeans still like to munch while drinking. However on the downside, the staff are not very attentive. They will not attend to you until you go and take a seat yourself, from several of my personal experiences. Perhaps it is their style of service, but I cannot really get used to it. Environment wise, I actually like the open atmosphere. That's when I can do my favorite activity - people watching! Perfect spot to chill and watch people as they walk along.",
