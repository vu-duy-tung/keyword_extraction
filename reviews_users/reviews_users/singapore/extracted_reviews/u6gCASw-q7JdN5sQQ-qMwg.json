    "text": "I had a good and interesting coffee here. The barista S who served us was really accommodating and friendly. Answered all my questions patiently. I said I was just recovered from food poisoning so I was drinking less milk and I wondered if I could get a piccolo latte although it wasn't on the menu and he said he would do one but if i didn't mind that it wasn't in the proper cup. He made it up in a smaller wide mouthed cappuccino type cup.Showed me the beans and invited me to have a whiff. Explained it was the 3rd type of bean after Arabica and Robusta..Liberica and popular in some Asian countries. Very strong he said.For a moment I worried that was a lead in to bitter sour but surprising..a warm herby and quite full bodied mouthfeel. Tasty and rounded. Different but good.I said it reminded me how sometimes you drink wine and there's a bit of funk or earthiness and you know its different but you can't always come up with the words to identify or describe right away but it doesn't mean its not good. He said yes earthy is how he would describe it.My friend enjoying the atmosphere with me is a non coffee drinker but she cooks and bakes so I said it was like how you can have yoghurt and its milky and sour but its not the same as milk gone sour. Food analogies rock!I asked what else S likes to drink and he said sometimes for non-coffee he makes himself a rose matcha latte. Then he said all our talk was making him feel like having a cup himself so he made up one and poured us a nice portion to try on the house.We will be back. Great spot to hideaway. Limited food menu..the kind you reheat. Some interesting cakes on display. Lattes and Caps at $4.50. Cosy corner shop. Closed on Sundays.Coffee roasted in their related facility in Johor Bahru! Those Liberica beans smelled lovely I must say.",

The lady that took our order was very considerate in telling me one of their speciality coffee that I initially wanted to order was a black coffee and confirming if I was okay with it. Ordered a lasagna and a rose latte. Lasagna was hot and soft, the latte lacked a little of the caffeinated taste but the rose taste was really soft and pleasant. The atmosphere of the cafe is quiet and conducive and staff was extremely helpful in asking if we wanted the air conditioning adjusted where we sat. Wifi available and powerpoints on some seats. Would definitely return.",

    "text": "This was the first ever caf\u00e9 I saw when I first drove to Everton Park. Located right at the corner of a HDB block and beside an ATM machine, it's really quite hard not to miss it. It's quite pretty for a HDB-based caf\u00e9. Comfortable sofas can be seen outside their door for people who prefer outdoor seating.The girls who manage the place are friendly and are evidently experts in their craft. They have their own handcrafted brews but I didn't dare try them as my colleague said they taste quite strong. I had their Almond Latte which I thought was really, really good. My colleague however tried their Rose Latte. She said that aside from the sprinkled dried rose petals, there wasn't much of a rose flavour.They have quite an impressive spread of cakes on display. We bought the chocolate truffles and carrot cake. My chocolate cake was nice. It had a chocolate crunch crust-base and a good layer of mousse. I almost wanted to try their sandwich as the menu claim to have Halal-turkey bacons, but opted out of it as I was craving for desserts only. Maybe next time.",

    "text": "I know what you're thinking... yet another coffee place in Everton? Recently, the neighborhood seem to have blossom with cafes. Nonetheless, Just want coffee is a pretty decent place. The baristas are friendly and the coffee is good. What sets them apart from their competitors, in my opinion, is their latte art. The baristas there really do take pride in carefully crafting whimsical cartoons on milk foam. It's great for kids (they serve non-caffeine options like green tea latte too!) and also impresses my adult friends too. Challenge your barista to draw anything! I only wish they have more appealing food options but there's a famous ang ku kueh store a few doors down that you can get your traditional snack fix.",

If you are around the area, this is one of many selections to choose from!",

There aren't many caf\u00e9s in Singapore that source such excellent beans and have baristas who really know how to get the optimal results through flannel or syphon. It's pricey, but worth it, and served in pretty porcelain cups for those who think coffee just tastes better in high quality ceramic drinking containers. ;-)",
