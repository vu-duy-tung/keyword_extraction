Savoury cocunutty broth with just enough spice to wake you up, and little noodles perfect for eating with just a spoon. Add in some seafood in the form of various fish cakes and you've got yourself a winner. A must try for even the most confused tourist!",

    "text": "This was our first meal in Singapore. It's at the corner of Ceylon and East Coast Road. The place happily promotes that it has AC. Guess it would help out on those hot tropical days. Look for all the pictures of the owner(s) and random celebrities. If you have an issue with milk or coconut milk then this place may be your new arch nemesis. Your bowels will not be pleased if you decide to consume this. Our waiter gave us a whopping 2 seconds before asking what we wanted. I guess there's only laksa available because he asked us which size: small, medium, large. We went for the medium and the Amerrrrrrican in me felt like I should have asked for XL. He then asked if we're okay with shrimp and if we wanted the clam. The shrimp was fine but the clams are quite fishy. If you're not ready for a taste of the ocean sea life, don't ask for the clams. He also murmured some other appetizer which we said sure to. It ended up being this baked curry paste thing wrapped in a banana leaf. Pardon my ignorance if I can't recall the name of it or what it's exactly made of. Damn tourist, at least we gave it a shot and it was just aiight.Next, a random old man came up to us and asked us for drinks. Don't freak out if he asks you to pay on the spot. He's working out of some other stall that doesn't belong to 328 Katong Laksa. Get the barley drink, it's supposedly a Singaporean favorite and out of all the ones I've tried during my time in SG, this was probably one of the better ones. It's a great counter to intake with your laksa noodle soup.The laksa comes out quick and the presentation looks simple yet the smell will make you want to dive right in. All you are given is a spoon. \u00a0They say they cut the white, thin, & round noodles enough where you can just spoon it out. I took it upon myself and grabbed some chopsticks elsewhere at broke tradition. Please don't punish me for it, I don't know any better. The coconut-curry soup base is rich and should be attacked immediately when it lands on your table while it's still steaming out of the pot. I'd recommend you adding some of that chili paste to give it a kick. It's really not spicy at all actually. The Thai in me wishes there was vinegar or lime wedges to go with the soup but I wasn't trying to be that picky. I think I killed the bowl within a few minutes. I'm still trying to distinguish if I was just hungry or if that bowl of noodles was just that legit. I'm going to say both. This place is probably known to the world as the joint Chef Gordon Ramsay stopped at. I guess that's why she chose it and I'm glad we checked it out because it was another enjoyable meal. It's a quick bite in a simplistic setting. I'm not surprised if it's cash only. We were lucky to stop by when it wasn't packed and I did notice other tourists meddling around. \u00a0I'm now a fan of this curry laksa noodle stuff.",

You order by the front door before you get a table so I recommend you get some otah to start because you get that immediately and can snack on that while you wait for your hot bowls of laksa. The laksa comes in 3 sizes and the small plus otah was a good portion for me. I wasn't super hungry though so can probably go for the next size up if I queued for any longer. This curry based broth was delicious but what's unique is it's a bowl of short noodles eaten with a spoon. Although tasty, I have a preference for long noodles which is probably why I personally rate it slightly lower. Oh, you can also tailor your order. I'm not a huge fan of cockles to be honest so requested none of those!",

Small for $5 and large for $7. Not bad at all. And its self serve so serve yourself. D\u00e9cor: you are in an open area/cafeteria style place. Food: great! Drinks: plenty. They have thai ice tea, coconut drinks, lime drinks and so on. Laksa ~ creamy, milk, delicious laksa. I love the shrimps and fish slices as well as all the fixins they add on top. The noodles are exactly what I like. Almost like that tapioca noodle. Perfect to soak up all the soup and stay al dente. Opak opak ~ fish in pandan leave aka the banana leaves. it is nice and flaky. Also their nasi lemak is also a good option If you want more crunch and flavors with your meal. Everything is reasonably priced, taste good. Their hot sauce is out of this world. The only complaint I have is that they chop their noodles up!! Like why?? I mean I know why I guess. They do it so that everyone can enjoy this soup with on spoon instead of using a spoon, a fork and some chopsticks. Faster way to eat your noodles. I'd prefer having to fight, roll and twirl my noodles in whatever I'm eating. Minus that, it's still pretty good. You can sit indoor or outdoor, take a picture with that massive wall of celebs pics and enjoy your laksa! YUmmm!",

My husband order the 3 small bowls of the laksa. He also ordered lime juice for himself and luohan longan for me. My mother-in-law was also with us, but she prefered something warm, but the shop does not offer anything warm so she did not want a drink. The order comes right out once he places his order and he brought all the laksa and drinks on a tray to our table. The laksa only comes with a spoon, there's no forks or chopsticks at this shop. I wanted a pair of chopsticks or fork because my noodles were quite long and each time I scoop up the noodles and toppings, all of the noodles would slide right off and only the toppings were left. Eventually I managed to look for the shorter noodles in my bowl and enjoyed those first. Which was pretty good, because there were slices of squid/cuttlefish. There were also small clam-like things in the laksa as well. I was not a fan of those and scoop most of them out for my husband, since he enjoys eating them. It's a good thing we occasionally like different things, because I could eat what he doesn't like and he can eat what I don't like. This shop only sells a couple of items on the menu and the main dish would of course be laksa. It would have been nice if there's more variety to laksa like the toppings or more different seasoning. I do like how they posted pictures of celebrities and famous people, on the wall, that had visited the shop back in the days. I could recognize some of the celebrities and it's nice to know they had been here one time, long ago.",

    "text": "I was told that this place has the best laksa by at least four locals, so I was determined to try it. \u00a0Btw, laksa is a traditional Singaporean curry noodle dish. \u00a0I had opted to go at night as the morning heat was too much to have curry. \u00a0Upon arriving, I had instantly noticed the wall of celebrities that have patronized the establishment. \u00a0I ordered the small laksa, and it was ready right away. I noticed that the three shrimps in the bowl was quite small, and nothing like the picture. I proceeded to try it, and sadly, it was nothing special to me. \u00a0Half-way through, I added a packet of their chili sauce, and this gave it a much needed kick. \u00a0I don't mean extra spiciness, but complexity. Before the chili sauce, it was a very boring bowl of noodles. \u00a0So, thank goodness for that chili sauce. \u00a0I liked the sauce so much that I bought a jar to take away.",

    "text": "When I told my Singapore friend, how much I love laksa, this was the one place he told me I had to try. So one day I hopped on the bus and went.328 Katong Laksa is a small self-serve restaurant. You order at the counter and then grab a seat at an open table. There is indoor and outdoor seating. There wasn't many people when I went, maybe because it was during off peak hours. I think it will be more crowded during the lunch/dinner time frame. I do recommend sitting indoors because there is a/c and trust me you will be sweating when eating that bowl of laksa. Their menu consists of laksa, small or large bowl for $5/$7, Nasi Lemak, $1.80 a packet, and Otah, $1.30 each. I tried the laksa and the otah. I personally think the small bowl of laksa is just enough. Note that you cannot alter the bowl of noodles at all, nor omit any ingredients. It comes just the way it is. It was a little bland for me, so make sure to add a packet of the sauce that comes with the bowl of noodles (from what I remember it comes with 2 packets, but charge per packet after that). It definitely adds more flavor to the broth. I have to warn those that cannot take the heat because it is SPICY. Also, expect to eat this with a soup spoon, no chopsticks/fork. The otah, a type of fish cake, was real good, especially if you add some of that sauce that came with your laksa.After pondering long and hard, the laksa was actually really good and is one of the better bowls I've had in Singapore, but I don't think I would take a 20-30 min bus ride all the way out here to satisfy my laksa craving.",

Well, I eat laksa must be spicy but this katong laksa isn't spicy to me at all. So for those who doesn't really eat spicy, this laksa should be good. Saw many famous overseas actors/actresses came to have laksa here many years ago because in the photos they are at their younger looks. The queue in line is long but still can be wait. It also sells tissue at $0.30 per tissue pack and beverages too. Overall I think is okay but venue is too far for me to come back anytime",

We took a cab to come here since it's in the outer part of downtown Singapore. For myself, I got the small Laksa bowl. It's pretty much chopped-up noodles in a coconut milk spicy broth. They put shrimp and clams inside the broth. They also provide you with 2 chili packets (up to 2 max. they charge you additional for more) which enhances the flavor of the Laksa. I recommend you use it! Overall experience, I enjoyed it & it's full of flavor. Don't think I can eat this too often though~ Must try it once when you are in Singapore though!",

You can choose to sit either indoors or outdoors, of course with Singapore's kind of weather, indoors is the only option for me. Enjoying the hot bowl of Laska with a cold drink of Barley is definitely satisfying for me. I often choose the $5 bowl which is enough to satisfying my hunger. The noodles in the Laska is sliced to small pieces which means a pair of chopsticks is not required and you can just enjoy with a spoon. It's has a strong flavour and every spoonful of it makes me want more, that's how I felt especially on my last trip there. For foreigners, you should come by to try at least once, get the feel of enjoying one of Singapore's popular dishes. Overall, I find this to be my liking and definitely give my thumbs up to those thinking of trying.",

I have eaten laksa less times than the fingers on one hand, but, this was delicious.the coconut milk mellowed the savoury base into this rounded, creamy soup with an unexpected lightness, and the tender noodles were slippery bits that worked its way between the fresh prawns and cockles. I certainly didn't expect to enjoy it nearly this much, and the just-on-the-edge sour of the lime juice was pretty perfect.the small coffeeshop space is fully air-conditioned, which is fantastic considering the heat and spiciness of the dish, but that luxury does reflect itself in its price. little matter though, as it honestly is more filling than whatever you'd receive at a newfangled cafe for the money, and is likely executed with more skill and finesse anyway.worth a visit, and definitely worth the money.",

This place has a reputation for making THE best Malaysian laksa around. It was. And just the way Singaporeans love their food. Spicy hot portions at street hawker prices. Grab an ice cold lime juice to cool off all that hotness. The space was small and although they said they had \"AirCon,\" it was a bit humid inside on the day we visited. There were at least 50 photos plastered on the walls, of celebrities who have slurped in these seats including Anthony Bourdain. But things may have changed since he's dined here. As I said before the laksa was good - with lots of noodles, cockles and prawns floating in a spicy chili and coconut broth. But the servers were mostly unresponsive. Think Soup Nazi - Asian style. But not just one. Many. I will also throw in here that most Singaporeans I have met or know as friends are warm and friendly, including the people working in the service industry. Most will smile and hand you back your Singaporean dollars with both hands - something so simple and polite - yet you don't see that exchange happening much in the states. I would have given them 5 stars if I were only rating on the laksa. But management clearly needed to offer the staff some Emily Post classes!",

When I want to ask for a pair of chopsticks, my Yelp friend realized I did not read up on Katong laksa before my trip as \"Katong laksa is a variant of laksa lemak from the Katong area of Singapore. In Katong laksa, the noodles are normally cut up into smaller pieces so that the entire dish can be eaten with a spoon alone, without chopsticks or a fork.\" *It is one of the most enjoyable laksa I have! The soup base is so rich with coconut and the hot sauce on the side just add the heat to the noodle itself. And eating with a spoon is just awesome as I probably have problem trying to pick up the slippery noodle with my chopsticks anyway.Silent while we enjoying our laksa... I will be happy to have one of this for lunch everyday..*Source from Wikipedia",

Penang style laksa battle, I think Katong Laksa is miles ahead of all else. The broth is deliciously bold with seafood, coconut and curry flavors. The noodles come cut so you can enjoy each spoonful with the perfect combination of soup and noodles. Cheap, delicious, authentic. YUM",

I don't think they offer chopsticks, even if you ask. The location is clean and casual. The service is efficient, but unfriendly. I would happily give them 5 stars if they ever cracked a smile .

The gravy is very flavorful. Spicy, but you can add extra chili if you want to kick it up a notch. The otah is tasty, and not spicy.Cost:Good value - the small Laksa was S$5.35 and the otah was S$1.40. Very reasonable considering the amounts.Service: They were very efficient and the order came out quickly.Atmosphere:This place is a typical small shop house in Katong. The indoor seating is a bit cramped, and consists of little plastic stools with no backs. One wall is full of historical photos of the shop and the owner.Overall:Come here for the Laksa, not the ambiance! But DO give it a try!",

The stock for this one was super good though so I didn't get too bogged down this time. That's my only true qualm with Laksa to be honest. They basically only serve soft drinks and their Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsey approved Laksa. Oh and some Otah too I think.",

Its not a full on 5-stars because I have had better laksa, but the \"Otah\" gets a full 5-stars. I have never had it before and its basically fish in a banana leaf, but omg the flavors!! Bursting with umami goodness - robust and complex, the smell reminded me of earthy mushrooms and black tea with a dash of soy. Taste-wise, not sure how to describe the Otah? A little bit spongy/ soft but not melting like jelly. My description doesn't do the Otah justice so just trust me on this and try some!!Will def recommend.",
