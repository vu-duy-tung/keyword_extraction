    "text": "One of many live music spots in Clarke Quay, The Pump Room differentiates a little with having a couple of their own brews. I enjoyed the Golden Ale and the IPA plus there's a buy-one-get-one-free happy hour special. Otherwise drinks can be expensive especially if you're not drinking alcohol. Bottled water for example is $12. Drink the beer. It's cheaper and they're pretty legit brews. We sat outside on a cool night so didn't really listen to the live bad but the bits I heard was decent. Overall a decent watering hole for happy hour. And from Sunday-Thursday, happy hour goes through 10pm.",

    "text": "We stopped in Sunday night as we saw the band. \u00a0It's typical Clarke Quay over pricing. \u00a0We ordered our drinks and one dessert. Drinks came but no dessert. \u00a0After 15 minutes, we had to interrupt the waitress from her phone and ask. \u00a0She very rudely said we we never ordered a dessert and that now it was \"finished\". \u00a0The band (named \"Sensation\" I believe) was Filipino and the music was very good. \u00a0The turn off was having to watch the two male singers grabbing their crotches on a regular basis and even directing that to a dancer on the floor. \u00a0The little man singer then proceeded to entertain us with his macho pelvic thrusting with female customers during the breaks. \u00a0It is a sad way to remember a band when the other six members did their best and were very good. \u00a0They should boot the two male singers and just let the ladies sing. The Pump Room is a definite \"miss\". \u00a0Many other nice places to spend that kind of money.",

    "text": "This place screams of a tourist trap, but since we were both tired of walking and we wanted to enjoy the picturesque Clarke Quay in Singapore, so we settled for a beer. This place boasts its own brewery, although like pretty much everywhere in Southeast Asia, beer (especially craft beer) isn't their strongest point. The price level reflects their tourist trap, or that because it's generally expensive to drink alcohol in this state-city. Not really worth a visit, unless you're here for the view, or for other touristic reasons.",

    "text": "I actually really wanted to like the bar, I really did, and the reason that I give it three stars is because I want to give credit where credit is due. First of all awesome music and awesome atmosphere. Secondly it is a microbrew and the beer that I had was nothing short of delicious (if you can use that word to describe a beer). However, the reason that it is not getting anymore than a three was become of the over zealous waiter. He was terrible. First of all I had no choice so to where I wanted to sit, and secondly he did not understand the concept of 'I only want one beer' - but it was happy hour, two for the price of one - yes, but I only want one beer. However, great beer, and I would give it another go, but watch out for the zealous staff (or go with somebody who will drink that other beer).",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I find this place a little bit too expensive for what it is. The food isn't anything to shout about, yet you can expect to pay SGD 25 and above for a main course. The drinks are expensive as well, and if you're looking to let loose and have a couple more drinks than usual, it's going to cost you here. I am not a big fan of the whole concept of transitioning from bar/restaurant to hopping club with live music as the night progresses. I certainly wasn't expecting that, and it started getting a bit too rowdy and crowded for my liking and we had to leave for a place that'd be more conducive for conversation.",

Anyway, GREAT MUSIC....the new band is very lively and a lot of people were dancing...like, the dance floor was packed. Super easy to get to as well...we drove and parked in the parking garage nearby, but the MRT lets out very close by as well. If you're looking for a place to party with good, cold beer and a solid band, I think this is among the best in Clark Quay.",
