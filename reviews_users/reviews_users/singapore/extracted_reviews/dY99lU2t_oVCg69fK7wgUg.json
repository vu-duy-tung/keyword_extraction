    "text": "I really liked this place! Their flavors are a bit more subtle but their open 24/7 so I'm a happy diner. It was clean, the service was prompt and the noodles were delicious. Best of all, there was no wait when we went. The ladies in the front don't really speak English but they speak mandarin. There are pictures near the cashier so you can just point to the picture of the dish you want. We go the bak chor mee, fish ball soup, and a side of fish cake. I liked the noodle texture and the noodle flavoring. As I said before, the flavors were a little more mild but I liked that about their noodles. My boyfriend loved the fish cake there. The fish ball soup was also very tasty. Overall, I would definitely definitely come back. Open 24/7 was also a huge plus! The food is good and the staff is nice! Bonus tip, we walked to the national library of Singapore from here and it wasn't too far. They have a cool gallery in the library and it's totally worth checking out! There are also museums and on the weekend, a cat museum near by. It was by far, my favorite day of exploring in Singapore.",

    "text": "A couple of years ago, if you asked what my last meal was, I would've said bak chor mee. Times have changed and so have my tastes (trying to go gluten-free), but I do like to indulge in the dish every now and then. Yesterday, was one such day and Da Lian was totally worth it! Noodles were QQ (al dente and springy), the chilli is really nice and the bowl had a lot of ingredients for $4.50. $5.50 gets you big-ass prawns and for higher prices you can get abalone, mother of pearl (NOT) or some combination of. If you're looking for the more vinegar-y type of bak chor mee or one with lots of pork lard, Da Lian isn't for you. Seating-wise, you can go al fresco (which I did and thoroughly enjoyed). There's also a pretty big space inside which has air-con. What really did it for me though, is that the second floor seems to be one of the offices of the Workers Party! Da Lian forever!",
