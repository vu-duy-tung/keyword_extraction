It has 2 of my loves, fish and soup!We ordered their 10 pax set dinner for $288 and it had:Coral trout steamboat - very fresh and sweet meat. Free flow of soup too. I'm really just happy with this fish soup and white rice. Homemade Tofu - very well executed dish. Tofu is soft in the inside and crispy on the outside. Sauce is also delicious!Asparagus with Scallop and Sea Cucumbery in XO Sauce - I love the slight spice that goes with the freshness of the scallop and the vegetable. Golden Roast - this roast chicken is not bad. Claypot Pork Belly with Salted Eggs - this is really a Claypot of goodness! I can't see the salted eggs but every mouthful is damn good!Prawns with sweet spicy Sauce - also not bad. Choice of Mango jelly or turtle shell jelly \u9f9f\u82d3\u818f \u00a0for dessert - nothing very special but a nice end to an awesome meal!Will definitely bring the extended family back to let them have a feast here too!",

The 3 stars was given because we felt that there were more fish bone parts than fish meat in the steamboat. The same goes for the Killiney road outlet except the soup stock was not as tasteful as the one in Balestier road. \u00a0The way steamboat is serve in this restaurant chain, one does not know what one gets until the dish comes to the table and one starts eating.However, the Killiney road outlet is more spacious than the one in Balestier.I would hesitate to patronise these restaurants on a regular basis.",

I didn't pay though so it might be expensive for what it's worth. The Holland Village XO fish bee hoon might be comparable.Mango pudding - 2 starsToo sweet.Guiling gao - 2.5 starsGood texture but wish it was served with honey. They gave what looked like a sugar syrup.",

    "text": "Fish steamboat is the signature dish here. There are 3 choices of fish:For medium size (recommended for 3 to 4 persons)- Badang - Quite common in many fish soup places $40- Garoupa - This is good and meaty but has some bones when filleted. Bigger chunks that flake $50- Pomfret - Sweet and even texture $60We took the Garoupa. The dish was a good portion and can also be shared with 5 persons. It comes with quite a lot of vegetables inside and some pieces of yam. The soup was really thick and flavourful and the steamboat kept everything piping hot even after the fire had gone out. It's a complete meal with some rice. It was served with their garlic chilli sauce which is quite spicy but really tasty.We ordered some other dishes and really liked the hae cho (prawn rolls). The Indonesian style claypot $13 was quite unctuous but seemed quite fatty as well with lots of skin. Simple stir fried veg was a generous portion for medium $11.",

Hence, do not wash your hair before visiting this place or I suggest you may wanna go to the salon after.It is a great venue for family dinner. You may already know that they are famous from the \u00a0celebrity-lined wall, however I have not seen any of them in the restaurant. The charcoal-fueled fish steamboat never fail to lift up the family gathering. \u00a0They have 3 types of fish to choose from, pomfret, garoupa and batang (boneless). Always choose \u00a0the amount of fish +1 more than the number of people you have because portion is rather small or I am a big eater. The soup is souperlicious! I really like the milky salty taste of it. That is the highlight.As for the side dishes, they are all not too bad. You may want to order them, but the highlight is definitely the fish steamboat. \u00a0Also, this is definitely a cheaper alternative compared to Imperial Treasure steamboat for their fish feasting.",

    "text": "The red garoupa hotpot ($35 for 2) itself was quite tasty. Don't get me wrong. But the whole experience just felt underwhelming. By the way, for those not in the know, it isn't actually a \"steamboat\" you expect in hotpot restaurant where you cook raw food. The dish comes boiling and the ingredients are already cooked when it's presented at the table. I've had this dish at their rival over at Serangoon Road twice before. I remember the soup over there being tastier. But we also ordered other dishes here like hei cho, sambal kang kong and prawn paste chicken wings. All were good but not outstanding. The chicken was particularly tasty. The whole meal for two ended up totaling $80. Felt like a rip off when I saw that we were charged for things like rice (it must be a cultural thing as I've not encountered additional payment for unlimited rice refills in any other country), soup refills (clearly a hidden cost because there's no way anybody would not ask for a refill since the first serving is a pathetic amount based on the shallowness of the pot), chrysanthemum leaves which you add into the soup and paper napkins. The waitress didn't have the initiative to inform that the leaves were an additional cost when she asked if I wanted them (the hotpot already comes with cabbage). Which I guess is typical \"service\" in Singapore. The \"soup refill\" and chrysanthemum leaves (a small plate of tatty looking vegetables) was $6.",

Say Hi for us!\" And if he is around, he will come by our table and have a short chat with my parents. If you do come by here, do order their trademark Fish Head Steamboat. I love the soup in the steamboat. Another trademark dish is their hot-plate tofu, prawn-paste chicken, roast chicken, coffee ribs, their cereal prawns and salted egg prawns. Do go down before 6.30pm as that is where the place hits the full house.. so getting a table will be quite difficult after that time.",

The shop opens from 5pm onwards till 9 :30 pm and you will realize the food market is relatively empty except for this stall and the drink stall.The food served is fish head steamboat and the cooking method is very authentic, using charcoal to heat the soup. The soup is very rich and you will realize the owner uses a lot of anchovies to cook it. The fish is tender and soft. Do try their duck wings, it is braised in an awesome gravy which does well with it. The meat is cooked to perfection and soft.However the waiting time gets longer if you reach after 6 pm, you can wait for 1 hour, it is that popular.",

The night we went the queue stretched from the foot of the stairs (the small, simple lower floor is JUST A DECOY - there's so many more seats UPSTAIRS) to a snakey line along the main road.Before you let that deter you, have patience. When you finally get to it, the steamboat soup makes it all worthwhile. they cook some of the freshest fish I've ever been served, and the flavours are so clean and simple, you'll wonder why new-age/fusion-y restaurants mess with tastes.Oh and before I forget - the steamboat comes to you with charcoal inside, which is as old-timey as you can get!
