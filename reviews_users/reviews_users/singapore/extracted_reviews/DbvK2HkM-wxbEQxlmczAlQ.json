    "text": "Located after the windy road off S. Buona Vista (nearer to Pasir Panjang) is this hipster cafe. There will be a row of shophouses and it is next to the intersection of Lorong Sarhad.Came here on a Monday around 1.30pm for my cousin's birthday party. Since my mother and I were the last one to arrive, some dishes are laid on the long dining table and we could taste some of the leftovers.Tried the risotto. Since it has been out for awhile before I arrive, the taste was not too great. We also tried the hot chick (fried \"popcorn\" chicken). Pretty well done as it was served after we arrived. The homemade chilli on the side did pair well with the chicken bites. The chicken skin was crunchy and the meat itself was juicy when served.My aunt then decided to order Kimchi Fried Rice for both my mother and I. We did not wait for long for it. When it arrived, it came in a bigger portion than expected (serves up to 2 or 3 pax). The lighting at the longest table was not that great hence I had to snap a quick photo before tasting the dish.For this dish, I love the steak slices. I ordered medium well and it turned out chewy and juicy to my likings. The kimchi portion for this dish was small. Would prefer it to be slightly more. The steaks definitely overpowered the flavors in the dish. For the rice, it was well-fried. The color of the fried rice were constant throughout the dish and the flavors linger in the mouth. Definitely one of the recommended dish here.I managed to try the \"famous and instagramable\" Berry Ricotta hotcakes. The berries were sweet and well-spread around the hotcakes. But the hotcakes itself was a little dry for me. Service was not bad either. The staffs approached quickly when you raised your hand. Price wise, it would be better if it is slightly cheaper. Will be back to try out other dishes.",

    "text": "After getting completely lost looking for this place, we were surprised to find a super cute cafe in the middle of (almost) nowhere. It's discreetly hidden amongst a row of shophouses so it's really cute.The service was a bit choppy - some servers were great and others were confused. I think if everyone had been a little more on top of things, I'd be a much happier customer!We got 3 things to share:1. Cauliflower fritters - decent with a nice dipping sauce but was a little too over fried, I think the cauliflower would have done equally well roasted and would have been even better and healthier2. Black rice with steak - really loved the texture of the rice which was bouncy and chewy and delicious with the Japanese mayo and tobiko! The steak was surprisingly juicy and not overcooked.3. Buccatini with thick cut bacon - this was disappointing, the sauce had no flavor (squid ink) and the bacon was really salty. The bacon however, did balance out the pasta which had no flavor. We agreed that this would have done better with udon rather than using a pasta.We had tea and coffee as well, all of which were fine but nothing stood out. I would go back if I lived/worked in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip.",

    "text": "Eclectic fusion finger food served while you lounge on vintage chairs.This very recently opened restaurant/drinks spot is located where the famous Lim Seng Lee Duck Rice Eating House once stood. The large windows, industrial-chic looking interior, differently textured walls of concrete, plywood and neon lighting already scream hipster before you enter. It's rather comfortable inside as you settle down and start looking at the menu. Some items are meant for sharing and the rest were noodle or yakitori dishes. I was very intrigued by the fusion dishes and proceeded to order the fried man tou sliders and toasted spicy rice cakes.Six fried man tou sliders arrived arranged on a large plate with two different sauces and a side of truffle fries. I was more impressed with the pork belly sliders than the lamb sliders, which I felt were too lean and dry. The korean rice cakes (Tteokbokki) arrived with a suitably crispy and slightly charred exterior with a spicy sauce mixed with a raw egg, salmon roe (ikura) and some pork slices. Although I enjoyed the juxtaposition of textures and flavors, the sauce was too salty for my liking.The coffee, however, is decently good. I saw the USD$21,000 Slayer(tm) machine sitting on the counter. I also think they get their beans from a local roaster. Earlier, I observed staff members at the bar fiddle with the Slayer(tm) espresso machine and attempt to coax it to deliver the right consistency of caffeine shot.Prices are much higher to compensate for not levying a service charge. I'm a little on the fence as the food is interesting but being a week old meant they still had a lot of kinks to iron out. Their wait staff were still rather new and confused on procedure, and the kitchen took a really long time (45 mins) to churn out the dishes before running out of food and closing early at 8:45pm. I saw a couple of angry (and hungry) customers exchanging words with the service staff. The repeated adjustment, tweaking and fiddling with the espresso machine also didn't give me much confidence.As I left, I'm reminded again of the good coffee as I saw the crate that the Slayer machine arrived in, displayed outside and used as a bench or table. Duck rice fans, you will have to head over to Little India. There's no duck on the menu here.",

    "text": "Paddy Hills offers unique dishes in a hip environment on the West side of Singapore. It can get very crowded on weekends, so I would recommend coming here for lunch during the week if you work on the west side!The unique spin on dishes here is definitely what makes Paddy Hills special. The Tonkatsu Ricotta, Salmon Dish, and Fish w/Potatoes were a few of my fav dishes. I am personally not a huge fan of potatoes but was very delighted to find theirs come in stringed shape, almost like noodles (see pic)Menu items I didn't like as much: - The Berry Hotcakes are also quite popular here, serving a generous portion of berries. The Hotcakes are very thick and filling however, and best for sharing among a group of 5-8 people (definitely not for one person). - The Pink Pasta was quite thick/creamy and small in portion size. I personally am not a huge fan of creamy pastas however so I may be biased here. - I also got to try the Garlic Fries as a side item, and found it to be the most mediocre item on the menu (among many exceptional items). Additional factors:- Location is a bit out of the way (need to taxi)- You pay the price. I went as a group of 3, ordering 3 mains, 1 side, and 2 coffees. The bill came out to $105 (and this was over lunch)!I definitely want to come back to try their other items. Overall a great ambiance with light wood, freshly roasted coffee, and friendly staff. Strongly recommend, if it wasn't for the price tag!",

Ambience was great - we were seated at the bar so we could watch the baristas in action. Service was also prompt. The quinoa salmon was well-executed, with the quinoa providing a satisfying crunch. The salmon was moist and flavorful. Portion's not very big though. Was hoping to order the squid ink pasta but it wasn't on the menu anymore. Ordered the uni tagliatelle and wasn't disappointed. The prawn was fresh and the pasta creamy with uni. Highly recommended. Ordered the berry hotcake due to the rave reviews I've seen on social media. It came extremely prettily plated, and there was a good assortment of berries. The cake itself though, was slightly too dry for my liking, though spots of cream in the cake was a nice tough. The cake itself wasn't too sweet, which was good, but I wouldn't come here just for this. It's a slightly pricey place for brunch. The above 3 dishes + a latte came up to $70+, though on the whole one of my preferred cafes in Singapore.",

If you're an adventurous food-lover, you will love Paddy Hills for their creative Australian-Japanese International Fusion Food and specialty coffee. Try their Golden Man Tou with Truffle Fries for an appetizing bite or Hao Da De Ji for sharing if you're with a big group.A coffee bar occupies the centre space of the caf\u00e9 where one can opt to sit at the bar to observe the skilful baristas at work. Psst, we spied the Slayer Espresso machine AKA the \"Ferrari\" of coffee machines.If you're looking for a spacious place with good Wi-Fi (it's the Neon Pink words on the wall outside!) and a soothing ambience to get some work done, drop by Paddy Hills on a weekday. We visited on a weekday and the crowd was gleefully minimal although we heard that it can get really crowded on weekends.Touted as a caf\u00e9 in the day and a tapas bar at night, we will be sure to stop by in the evening for our next visit.",

Love the full bodied layers despite the milk in the latte. Ordered the small breakfast and berry ricotta hotcake. Great stuff again!! Small breakfast was polenta and a runny egg on toast, with the morning-welcome fragance of mushrooms and truffle. Hotcake was fantastic despite the 30-minute wait - great on the palatte and the eyes. Great for breakfast. The food quantity is actually good enuf for 2 persons to share so order accordingly. What a difference from my last brunch visit. Niceee",

The kimchi fried rice was also quite scrumptious and came with a good portion of medium rare steak, alas the steak was of middling quality. The real winner here were actually the cocktails (white sangria to be specific). At $18 a piece they aren't cheap but if you want to splurge it's worth it! It feels like you're paying for the vibe, which is fair given the dearth of hip places like this in Singapore, but I froze my butt off with the AC cranked up and they couldn't move us because of a lack of available tables.",

The fried rice is prepared in such a way that it doesn't feel like you are eating typical Chinese fried rice, it feels like actual quality in every bite. It comes with some steak slices and an egg that you mix to add a bit more flavor. Totally recommend getting this plate.I also ordered the cauliflower fritters (didn't expect it to be such a large portion) and the Paradise Shake(?) (the one with coconut and torched pineapple). So so so good, the shake didn't even feel heavy.My girlfriend ordered the berry ricotta pancakes which were also really good.Highly recommend checking this place out.

If a menu requires Dr Google's assistance to make an informed decision, that's far too much posturing. I mean, how many regular people know what bagna cauda is? Or even how to pronounce it?! Also, a girlfriend took issue with the mispresentation on the menu. What was named 'Hash Hash' with a description of \"sauteed beef, mushroom, chorizo, doughstick and sous vide egg\" turned out to be a beef bak kut teh. Calling a dish \"hash\", she said, and I quite agree, implies that the whole jin-gang is sauteed, as you would a breakfast hash. A soupy bak kut teh IS NOT a hash. Strip away the pretense, I think, and re-direct the effort to the food. That's what draws in the crowds anyway.We had:1) Berry Ricotta Hotcake ($23) adorned with blueberry sugar, pinenuts, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, yuzu gel, and maple syrup: Very pretty, and it tasted as good as it looked. Thick, dense, but fluffy, these were the best pancakes I've had for as long as I can remember.2) Quesadillas ($20) stuffed with pulled duck and pickles, served with charred baby capsicum and sweet corn, and sided by a garlic aioli and guacamole: The quesadillas, in addition to being laced with parsley, were mediocre. My parsley-loving friend, who had this, said to give this a hard pass.3) Hash Hash ($24): Misleading description aside, this was a reasonably commendable and very comforting bowl of beef bak kut teh. Meltingly soft and wonderfully fatty, the luscious hunks of meat could have passed off as pork if I hadn't been informed otherwise. I particularly liked the western twist of the sous vide egg, arugula leaves, and chickpeas.4) Kimchi Fried Rice ($20): much touted, but turned out middling, even with the perfectly wobbly sous vide egg, and medium-well tender steak.
