The regulars would always come back to have Tom yam soup! Then just 6 months ago a shop took over Nakhon Thai. But Nakhon open 2 shop away from it. Now we have both Thai restAurant and both are having a long queue. The price are similar in both of them. Nakhon is definitely better still. Great price, good portion and amazing quality. Thumbs up!",

Not only is there a queue to sit and eat-in but there is a queue for to-go order pickups. Post-lunch time, there wasn't a wait but there were still people coming in to be seated. Overall, the meal was satisfying and I was quite pleased. Thai iced tea (Red), Pad Thai, and Papaya Salad. I'd say the papaya salad was my favorite as it tasted most similar to what I've had in Thailand. The Pad Thai, in my opinion didn't taste as authentic but was still good. The Thai iced tea was not overly sweet which was nice too. I'll have to try the green Thai iced tea next time. Service was good and seemed to be pretty attentive at the time. They also provided water. Atmosphere, pretty chill and more open so it was warm but there were fans so that is nice. I'd recommend and would come back here for Thai food. Tip: if it's during busy hours, order for pickup which may save you some time",

They don't accept card so remember to have cash in hand.Popping open the goods at home was a bit hit and miss. Two of the dishes, the olive pork and green bean chicken were micro portions whilst the olive rice and green curry were of a good size.Overall the flavours were good, Birdseye chillies dotted around in the rice are the main spice factor, otherwise nothing was particularly spicy. Definitely better than taking away from Thai2go.Not impressed with portion size.",

The food that came along satisfy both my stomach and feet which had to endure a punishment similar to the days during National Service. The place is located on the first floor of a HDB block. It may not look glamourous, but the cost of the food is cheaper than its competitors but the quality of the food makes up for it. I enjoy every spoonful of Tom Yum soup which may be spicy to some and had a bit of difficulty finishing it. The main dishes that came along with the soup are fabulous. The Basil Beef and Pineapple Rice are my favourites. Since the queue is long, there should be a timing for the every customers, as some of them take their own sweet time finishing their food! (Annoying). Overall, I enjoyed the food this restaurant offers, whether its the best remains debatable but certainly is one of the better ones out there.",

    "text": "Nakhon Kitchen is a hidden gem in the Kovan neighborhood in the North-eastern corner of Singapore that serves authentic Thai cuisine in a friendly and kooky Thai atmosphere. Once you step into the shop, you'd be transported to the back alleys of Bangkok with all that upbeat Thai pop tempo, mouthwatering waft of hot delicious food and the friendly smiles and eager to please faces of the servers. The Pineapple Fried Rice (S$6) is a standard dish that i would order here. The sweetness of the pork floss goes perfectly with the slightly curried Thai rice which is slightly fluffy and chewy. I like that it is not too dry. The rice is fried with shrimps, cashew nuts and raisins and best eaten with Green curry! Almost every table had an order of this. Nakhon used to serve this in a pineapple but i guess it was too troublesome for them. A Thai meal is never complete without Tom Yam Soup and Nakhon has 2 different types, 1 thick base and 1 clear, with the option of Seafood, Shrimp or Chicken (S$6). The milky base is the less spicy option with some tomatoes added to neutralize the acidity. I personally prefer the clear base. It looks innocuous enough but boy that chili padi in the soup can kill. It's a clean and sweet taste with tartness to it in your first mouthful. Amazingly addictive but u may feel that acid biting into your stomach after.Awesome and affordable thai food right this way!",

    "text": "I love this place for Thai food but not the queue. There is always a long line of people waiting in the evening. The queue may move fast, but really it depends on how quickly the diners wolfed down their meals. This is not the place for a nice relaxing dinner but it is the place for good and affordable Thai food. The tom yam soup (noodle or just soup) is fiery spicy. I find both clear and the milky versions to be equally tongue-numbing, but the clear soup has a a sharper tartness to it. Other dishes to order will be the green curry chicken and pandan chicken. The pad thai, pineapple rice and olive rice are good but not something that linger in the mind. They do a mean iced thai tea though. A bonus is the take-away counter at the other side of the restaurant. Instead of going straight to the cashier inside, you can now place an order at the counter for take-out. You can also call ahead to order before doing a pick-up. With this, I can see myself ordering food more often for days when I do not want to face the long queue and want some basil chicken rice.",

Definitely rather authentic thai food with a very reasonable price, which explained the humongous line every evening if you are here at peak meal times.No aircon and you sit below a HDB block, I guess you can't get more local than that.The dishes:- tomyum soup clear: flavorful but oh-so-spicy that we had to tell them to tone it down. They brought it back to add more broth and we received \"these two are such lousy chilli eaters\" looks from fellow diners - Thai fish cake appetizer: as good as any you get in Bangkok. Totally yummy.- Thai basil chicken: very good. I like that they use real chicken pieces instead of minced chicken like some other Thai places- pad Thai tang hoon: for a difference to the regular pad thai, we went with glass noodles stir fried pad thai style. If you like pad thai, you will still love this dish. A good version of pad thai, which is a simple dish not always well done.Adding two lemongrass drinks each, the bill came up to $30. Great value!",

    "text": "This is hands down my favorite Thai food place in Singapore. The prices are amazing for the quality of food you get - $6 on average for noodle dishes e.g. pad thai as well as rice dishes e.g. pineapple fried rice. 90% of the stuff on the menu is under $9, and they don't skim on the portions either.I love the pandan fried chicken - succulent chunks of marinated chicken wrapped tightly in pandan leaves and deep fried. They come in plates of 4, which I can easily mop up all by myself because it's that yummy and yes I'm a glutton. I order it every single time and I'm still not tired of it.Another must-have is the thai style kang kong, served in a stylish elevated dish. It's very tasty, but I usually tell them to go easy on the chili padi. The tom yam soup is extremely extremely spicy. Which isn't to say it's not delicious and addictive in a masochistic kinda way. Like your tongue is already on fire and instead of putting the fire out you just wanna douse it with more delicious fuel. Piece of advice: share it with someone or you'll spend the entire night in the bathroom.I've tried the pad thai, pad see ew and pineapple fried rice, all of which are authentic and great complements to the spicy dishes. Oh and if you love cereal prawns but hate to peel them, they serve their cereal prawns half peeled. For some magical reason the prawns remain juicy even though they're cooked without their shells, and they're buried until a TON of cereal which goes great with pretty much everything.And finally, red ruby and mango sticky rice for dessert. If you have to pick one, go with the red ruby. It's not too sweet and is extremely refreshing after a spicy meal. Plus the milkiness puts out whatever fire you induced into your mouth.Definitely go there with a bunch of friends and share as many things as possible. Try to go early, like before 11.30am for lunch and before 6pm for dinner, or be prepared to queue.",

I reached at 6pm and only got a table at 7pm but the food made up for it's other shortcomings. My order: 1. Tom Yum soup with fish only - 5/5! They have the clear version too. Fish was fresh and serving size was adequate. 2. Stir fried kang kong with belachan - tasty but abit on the salty side. 3. Basil Chicken - very tasty and spicy! Not too oily too.4. Red Ruby Dessert - a lot of coconut milk used and the ice chips melted really quickly. Prefer their savory dishes. 5. Thai Milk Tea - nice! Helps to dissipate the spiciness of the food.This restaurant has a siesta in the afternoon and closes at 3pm and reopens at 530pm for dinner. Take note!",

I used to think that they were just slow at serving food and clearing tables, allowing the queue to form, until I tried it out for myself.In contrary to what I initially thought, service at Nakhon was quick and efficient. Despite the seemingly long queue, the wait for a table was not more than 15 mins. The staff took down my order while I was still in the queue so the food came almost immediately once we got a table. However, do not expect immaculate service here at Nakhon. Probably due to the busyness of the restaurant, the staff can be rather impatient when dealing with customers. Food is cheap and good! It is cheaper than restaurant chains such as Thai Express, yet I find it more authentic. I really enjoyed the Clear Tom Yum Soup they serve, as well as the Thai Mango Salad and their Phad Thai. I have reservations about their green curry though, as I have had inconsistent experiences with it. The first time I had it, it was thick and flavourful but my recent orders of green curry have been disappointing. The green curry has recently become pretty diluted, with fewer chicken and mushroom pieces. Overall, I would still recommend Nakhon as a good place to go for affordable, yummy Thai food. Go early for dinner (around 5-ish pm) if you want to avoid the queue!",

    "text": "This trusty gem of a neighborhood eatery is what most of us Hougang peeps turn to when we're looking for a quick Thai fix. That the restaurant is staffed entirely by Thais should be an obvious sign of authenticity.At dinnertime, there's almost always a 30 minute wait to be seated at Nakhon Kitchen, even on weekday evenings. I wouldn't dream of coming here for dinner on weekends, so I don't know how crazy a Saturday or Sunday queue can get. Once you're seated, however, service is prompt and your dishes are served in no time.Pineapple Fried Rice, $6.00 - One of the few non-spicy dishes on the menu, the pineapple fried rice here at Nakhon Kitchen is lightly curried, sweet, and nicely complemented by raisins and a light sprinkle of pork floss. Pretty average, but nevertheless useful to have this on hand if you're ordering the tom yam soup.Black olive fried rice with minced chicken, $6.00 - If you're not a believer of fruits in your rice, you've got another carb option in the form of olive fried rice. I actually prefer it to the pineapple rice, as the salty fragrance of olives and siew dam (a dark, syrupy Thai soy sauce) pervades every grain of rice in on that plate. The accompanying chopped raw onions and cashew nuts add a welcome crunch to each spoonful of rice as well.Tom Yam Soup, $6.00 - Ah, the tom yam soup. Where do I even begin? If you're one of those people who have no problem at all with spice, by which I mean you're capable of eating baby red chillies without breaking into a sweat, then you'll enjoy this. Objectively speaking, this is very good soup - it's filled with the distinctive aroma of lemongrass and has a satisfyingly tangy taste due to the addition of tomatoes. Generous serving of fresh seafood within as well.Thai vermicelli salad with seafood, $6.00 - Don't be fooled by the deceptively mild appearance of the yam talay here. I used to find this salad incredibly spicy, but after drinking the tom yam soup this yam talay seems to possess the spice level of a Happy Meal. That metaphor doesn't even make sense, but I trust you understand what I mean. Sour, fiery and refreshing, this vermicelli salad functions as an excellent palate cleanser and whets your appetite for the dishes to follow.Kang Kong Belachan, $6.00 - When my conscience is niggling from all that pigging (wa I'm a poet), this stir-fried veggie dish is something I always order to try and make myself feel better. Like oily vegetables will negate the effects of the other dishes from hell that I'm eating. The kangkong served at Nakhon Kitchen is crunchy and nicely infused with the fragrance of fried garlic as well as the shrimpy flavour of belachan. Only gripe is that it could be a little less oily.Stir-fried minced pork with basil leaves, $6.00 - This dish is a must-order for me every time I visit. Basil leaves are an acquired taste for most, and to me they taste wretched when consumed in isolation. They remind me of liquorice, which I happen to be terrified of. I do, however, think they're excellent when they lend their flavour to stir-fried meats. Nakhon Kitchen's rendition of pork and basil is one of the best there is.The more observant among you would probably have noticed that the dishes reviewed in this article all cost $6.00. Split between three, it works out to a reasonably priced dinner. Plus the food's great, which makes this place is one of my favourite Thai eateries in Singapore. Just a gentle heads up, in case you haven't realised what I've been repeatedly driving across - the spice level here isn't for the faint-hearted. This is value-for-money Thai food that packs a lethal punch, and I'd advise you to come prepared for your stomach lining to bear the consequences of your meal.",

I went there early, fully intending to skip the crowds before they form. By 5, I arrived and true enough, I got a table immediately without a wait. So there is NO excuse whatsoever for the surly service. The waitress behaved like the patrons owe her a living. Really! She should consider a different career choice, because she's clearly unhappy with what she's doing. The average service standards in Singapore are beyond appalling in general, when compared to service in the US, Japan and Bali. But this place takes the cake in bad service, even by Singapore standards! Service is several notches below norm in Singapore. When we asked her something, she didn't bother to reply, appeared to mutter something and walked off rudely. If this restaurant was in any city in the US, ANY city, it wouldn't last beyond six months with such appalling service and mediocre food. The food is extremely mediocre. I've had much better Thai food anywhere. The Thai seafood curry was watery and flavorless. The fish cake was bland and dry.How reviewers here even think this standard is anything above ordinary is beyond me.Oh there is an air-conditioner in the restaurant, but because the restaurant has no doors, it's as hot as an oven whether you sit inside or out.",

    "text": "This tiny casual restaurant can be located about a 5 minutes walk away from Kovan MRT station. It is located somewhere near kovan superbowl but at the opposite side of it. There is always a long queue and even longer during dinner time and the wait can go up to 30 minutes or longer.Somehow this place just manages to draw people back to the restaurant despite the not so cheap pricing, the super long waits and queue, and the small portions of food. Probably like me, people would rather come nearby to satisfy their cravings for thai food rather than go to town area.I do like their thai fish cake, pandan chicken, green curry, pineapple rice and tom yam soup though. Maybe the taste is hard to wrong but i don't mind the wait and slightly over-priced meals. Once in awhile dining here would be fine. So it's really up to individual people's opinion i guess.",

    "text": "My friends and I arrived on a weekday night for dinner, and we joined the line of hungry patrons. After an hour of wait, we got our table. Food arrived really quickly because we already placed our orders while in line. Black Olive Fried Rice is very fragrant and yummy! It is not too oily or salty, just right! Tomyum Soup with Fish is really awesome! The soup is flavourful with a little on the spicy side, still tolerable, while being a little more sour than most tomyums. But I love it! I couldn't stop scooping from the bowl! The other food we ordered, Thai Fishcakes, Pha Thai, Sambal Kangkong - really spicy, Basil Chicken were okay, not too bad but not fantastic. Overall, food is pretty authentic and flavourful at affordable prices! We cleared everything on our plates! However, the waiting time is really long and their toilet is a no-",

    "text": "Great Thai food that is reasonably priced! Serving all you Thai favorites from Pad Thai to Basil Chicken rice, this place is a winner. Just look at the queue for dinner if you don't believe me. I am not going to talk about the food here but instead I am going to highlight their efficient queuing system. When you're in line, \u00a0up till the 3rd or 4th person, your order is being taken concurrently so by the time you're seated, your food comes, saving all the frustration from having to order and wait yet again. This system has worked well obviously as many customers are satisfied to queue because they know the line moves fast and they will not be kept waiting once seated. The length of the queue is testimony of how good the food is so don't be put off by the long line!",
