    "text": "i get excited just by looking at the menu; the lunch menu were mostly combos that came with korean fried chicken along the mains. I just wish i can give everything a try but too bad i only have 1 stomach. Anyhow i was late to the restaurant during lunch break so my friends went ahead and ordered budae jjigae to share. while waiting for the food to cook at the table, we ventured to the condiment table and helped ourselves to the free flow kimchi and other assorted side dishes available there. there were also minced garlic, green onions and sesame oil for you to use.in the pot of budae jjigae, the main ingredients were hotdogs, spam and smoked ham. the red pepper paste was given in a separate bowl and not mixed into the jjigae which is good for those who prefer to adjust the level of spiciness on their own. the only downside to this dish is that it gets saltier as you eat. we couldn't finish the jjigae because it was just too much for our plalette to even to have the soup with rice. service was good and we found the servers to be attentive despite having a full house. the only grumpy person i saw was the manager behind the cashier. he wasn't too happy when some customers seek his help to throw away the coffee cups after they had free coffee from the machine placed at their restaurant's entrance. btw offering free (aka service in korea) coffee is quite a common practice in Korea. So don't forget to get your free cuppa next time if you spot a coffee machine on your way out after you are done footing your bill.",

    "text": "Needed a jeongol fix and found a line leading to my craving at Suntec Mall. Guksu and Kimchi Korean Restaurant are sisters and located within a stone's toss from each other on the 2nd floor of the mall. We ordered the Daeji Gogi Jeongol that claims to feed 2-4 pax. With my appetite, I think it serves only one. The jeongol was a nice mixture of pork, mushrooms, veggies and broth. \u00a0There is also a condiments bar to load up on the sauces, condiments, and endless cold corn barley tea. Will be back to try the individual hot pots starting a $14.90++",

    "text": "We had dinner here on a Thursday evening and it was fairly empty. The jeongols looked really enticing but we settled for individual portions of noodles instead. I had the beef guksu, and it was good. It was lighter, reminding me of a warm naengmyun, instead of the heavier guksu, but I liked it. The food here tends towards modern instead of traditional Korean. The jeon was also different, modern style. I would be happy to come back again the next time I'm in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip.My colleague came after hearing me talk about this place, and she had the gamjatang. The cut of pork isn't quite right (hard to get the right cuts in general here) but that meant that there was more meat than usual in her gamjatang. She wasn't too upset about it. I think her husband enjoyed it.",
