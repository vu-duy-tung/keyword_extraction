The restaurant has 2 areas where you can chill, the outdoor and the indoor. Outdoor will be along the alley which is nicely decorated with graffiti. In addition, they have long sofas to accommodate large group of peopleThe drinks are affordable during the happy hours, the food they served are delicious too, especially the cheese finger stick. It definitely goes well with the booze. During lunch hours, do try their curry chicken and fish and chip. The chicken is soft and tender, together with the thick curry gravy, heavenly.Great place with nice music at the background, certainly a place worth visiting after work.",

The bar expands up 3 floors and across to another building. On a cool weekend evening, its often hard to find a table, both outside and in. They often host themed nights such as 90's RNB which are buzzing till late.The food is mediocre unless paired with some alcohol to amplify the taste, my personal favorite are the Balls of Fire. The sheesha is quite good and reasonably priced with a selection of flavors to boot. Drinks are also reasonably priced and there is something for everyone.The facilities are weirdly located almost inside the kitchen but are kept relatively clean. All in all a fun time with the right crowd.",

From time to time, a live jazz band plays on the 2nd floor. The place was rather \"underground\", used to be set apart from your more commercial offerings, but of late it has gotten rather popular with the locals and expats. Hardly a place for a relaxing evening these days. But they still serve decent food and beers, I would still come if I can find somewhere to sit. Do make a reservation beforehand if you intend to be there on a Friday night.",

Drinks are okay - not the cheapest but not out of this world either. Blu Jazz tends to be filled with tourists and foreigners who just moved to Singapore, with the latter often searching for an 'authentic' Singapore experience. Perhaps because of the crowd, Blu Jazz can sometimes feel fake and off-putting, but hey, when the crowd is right, Blu Jazz can be pretty awesome.",

    "text": "Met up with some friends for drinks here and was very pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting Kampong Glam to have any bars -- this is the Muslim quarter after all! -- much less a funky bar like this that looks like it's been transported straight out of Melbourne or Berlin. This bar is cool and hip, mildly grungy, edging on the side of hipster but not quite there (thankfully). Nearby Haji Lane and the narrow laneways around it are chock full of street art and graffiti, so I felt like I was definitely back in Melbourne.The place is in an old house (mansion?) with pretty shutters on the windows and outdoor seating in the laneway to the side of it. Inside, it's an explosion of colour and Moroccan lamps, crazy mirrors, and a faintly Middle-Eastern-on-acid vibe. Whatever, it works. There's a huge stage and often live music here. When we went, it wasn't jazz music -- I think it was more rock, but I don't actually remember because we wanted to have a conversation so we chose to sit outside.We went on a weekday night and it was PACKED. They barely managed to squeeze our group of 5 in. They weren't serving full meals, just bar snacks, and we didn't order any so I can't comment on the food. Drinks didn't seem any cheaper or more expensive than in other parts of Singapore, and they serve massive Tiger Beer towers here (our group of 5 shared one and it was plenty of beer!)Staff was super-friendly in spite of how busy the place was. There was a veritable monsoon while we were there, and staff were quick to rush out and crank up the roof cover thingie so we wouldn't get soaked.I noticed that this place was way more popular with Westerners (either tourists or expat workers, I don't know) than with local Chinese-Singaporeans or Indian-Singaporeans. I'm not sure why, but that's what I noticed.Definitely recommend checking this place out if you like the cool, hip, unpretentious types of drinking holes, especially for live music.",

Few hiccups here & there, but Blu Jaz was on point.The first thing you'll notice is the loungey, laidback caf\u00e9 feel to the place. The inside had some decent space to it, but like the others said, it really is a little run down. It could go for some sprucing, but nothing crazy. \u00a0It felt like an authentic, jazz lounge you'd drink at in Louisiana, or a hot reggae spot you'd find in the Caribbean. All in Asia - DOPE! We sat in their outside terrace, where the area is on the sidewalk - lets you be close enough to everyone moving about, without them being all up in your food. The menu has a great variety & selection, and the brunch options were good. The food tasted great, and the drinks were good too. We spent 2 hours here without even realizing it. Good vibes!ONLY compliant was the waiter got our meals wrong. When we brought it up to them, they were mad cool & chill about it, took back the wrong plates, and brought us the right ones. Blu Jaz is fun. FUN. You ever in Singapore, and looking for a place where we could have a good time with great food & drinks, this is a good ticket. As a fan of cool, I encourage you to check out this place. Just reiterate your order before your waiter leaves. Good vibes wayy up.",

Friday night here was a ton of fun for me. I wouldn't hesitate to return again!--*Admit it, you like reggaeton when you're drunk!",

I'm, particularly, a huge fan of the band Fuze Collective headed by vocalist Fendi Sahid. Fendi is one of the few artists based in Asia that has a voice that oozes with Soul... So rare to find in this part of the world. In fact, as good as the Jazz artists / Jazz bands we would hear from the Dirty South, USA. Fuze Collective performs on Saturday Night, so if you're free, be sure to check them out.If Jazz isn't your thing, there is a fantastic night club on the second floor. The cover charge is $10 and is well worth the price of admission. During my last visit, on a Friday night, DJ was jamming it up with Reggaeton. Who knew, they play Reggaeton in Singapore, but they do at Blu Jazz! I found myself reminiscing my college years in New York City. I give this place four stars. The music fantastic. However, the facilities are a little run-down. Additionally, there is not a lot of room for patrons to hear music on the first floor. In short, Come early! By far the best place to hear great music in Singapore.",

    "text": "It was my last night in Singapore and I decided to abort \"Operation Hermit: Last Night\" edition. I had been reading about this place during my vacation planning and it sounded really great, so I wanted to try it. After doing some investigation, I became enlightened and learned this place does a \"Reminisce\" night every 3rd Saturday or something. WHAT? Reminisce...in Singapore? Why not? I'll try it! I threw on the simple shorts and red lips and hailed a cab from my hotel. But, I did throw on a shirt too, but I just thought it would change the tone of this review to say I threw on a shirt. But, I just said it, so, dang. Messed it all up. Okay, moving on :/Blu Jaz is in a really convenient area. It's next to everything, including a 24 hour McDonalds about a 10 minute walk from the joint. This is important because drinking will probably take place on great music nights, so you should eat after so you won't be sick! Please, guys, eat! When I arrived, the DJ was playing MJB's, \"You remind me\". I was like, ohhhh, okay. I see ya'll. I looked for the entrance to the 2nd floor and paid the S$10 cover. No biggie. \u00a0After that song that made proud of myself for actually leaving my hotel room, it kind of went down hill. Don't get me wrong, the music was good, it was just...NOT reminisce type music. Maybe I'm just getting old, but 2012 or 2013 isn't going to make me reminisce about anything but the bills I was paying that year. I want to think about my care free days, you know, no responsibility days. I looked at my watch, it was about 11, still early, I'll give it some more time.At midnight, DJ Titus came on the scene and this dude GAVE ME LIFE!!!!!!!!! He was the best DJ I've heard since moving to Asia! He made me feel like I was in Chicago with my buddies cutting all the rugs! He dj'd for about 2hrs...maybe. Then, the original guy came back. He started playing...*gasp*...*gasp again* (because it's that serious)...REPEATS! YES, soooo early in the night. I was so confused. I didn't understand why they started repeating songs so soon. It was annoying, I left after that. However, DJ Titus was not a disappointment and I would love to go to an event when he's DJ-ing the whole night. I'm sure I would have sweat dripping down my legs creating puddles from dancing so hard! I realllllly enjoyed this dude. I will definitely return to Singapore and to blu Jaz as soon as I touch down. Great spot. Note: I did go to that 24hr McDonald's after this spot because my tequila intake was pretty serious. Okay. Go and have fun (to blu jaz, not McDonalds). :D",

If the second floor is too busy for ordering drinks, walk on up to the third floor where it's a bit emptier (or at least that was the condition on Friday 11pm-ish).

Prices are a little steep too - compared to the other establishments in the area. The food too, isn't all that great. It's basic finger food. I mean, it's not exactly memorable.

We strolled around at 11pm and I was a bit disappointed. I think I was expecting something like Lan Kwai Fong (LKF) in Hong Kong where people are just dancing in the streets with music blasting from every storefront.We heard Blu Jaz was a cool venue and were seated pretty promptly on what seemed to be a busy night. Ordered a few mixed drinks (gin and tonic, vodka tonic, etc) and we seriously couldn't taste any alcohol in any of our drinks. They're reasonably priced at $10-12 but I'd rather pay more for a stiffer drink.The hookah (shisha) was fun - we had the mint flavored stuff. There was a live jazz band playing indoors (we were seated right outside) so that added some great ambiance. There was also a video projection of a DJ spinning upstairs in the club that looked pretty happening. We tried to check it out but with a $10 cover at close to closing time, we decided not to waste our money.Overall a fun place for a really chill night.",

Blu Jaz is that place in Singapore.To be fair, the music, DJs and indie events they hold here on the second and third floors are always good fun.It's just that the bar/cafe... it's exploded, and in the process it's lost something we once loved about it. The casual and intimate vibes about this eclectically decorated place were its star attractions. Now that hundreds of people feel the same way, you can rarely get a table or hear anybody when they're talking. Service has become brusque and impersonal.No fault of theirs. It's a tricky thing to be this popular. The food, which used to be pretty acceptable at its price range (mid-range), is no longer so.I still want to love it, I still want to go every time, but I can never get a damned table. These days I just go to the better bar/restaurant *behind*, that they also own... even when Piedra Negra gets crowded, at least you can stand/sit in the streets.",

    "text": "I love this place cause it's really casual and a good place to just catch up with friends for some food and drinks. The prices are mid range but worth it for the portion that you get. It gets really hard to get a table in the evenings and weekends but they usually try and find a way to accommodate you. The place is open for lunch and dinner and the one dish I like best is the Beef Lasagne. It's amazing. The sauce that's in the lasagne is so good. It's piping hot when it comes out and you will definitely be wanting more after you finish it. What else is good is the Balls of Fire and the Zing Wings. You can also have Sisha here and the price is about the same as the other places around Arab street. Overall this place is great for a casual night out with friends.",

    "text": "Not really one of my favourites, it is nevertheless a great place to hang out for casual drinks and an easy meal with friends. It's not excessively priced, although the food tends to be pretty average.They got really popular and it's always packed, resulting in an odd expansion of the venue. Whilst the shophouses they occupy are atmospheric and nicely done up, they've also got a sequence of unsightly tables lined up along the pavement. Not really the best seats in the house, but this is where you usually end up if you arrive later in the evening and all the other seating options have been taken up.",

    "text": "Nice place to relax and socialize with friends. Food and drinks are cheaper than Clarke Quay but normal standard. Sometimes the live music can get loud. Shisha also available and the Balls of Fire (small chicken fried balls) are good but are not consistent in taste and can get salty some times. If you are in the mood let your hair loose on the dance floor above. Entry to the dance floor is free.",
