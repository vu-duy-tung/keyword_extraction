    "text": "Literally behind Raffles Hotel is a place that serves a very fine example of Chicken Rice. It's location and tasty chow make it a excelelnt choice for tourists, like myself, to sample this classic Chinese/Malaysian dish. Unlike a hawker stall, this is a restaurant that provides table service which is efficient and friendly. You'll sit on stools in a room open to the street (no air conditioning) in a traditional Asian restaurant format. A menu with photographs makes it especially tourist friendly.Beside the very flavorful chicken and rice, the \"meal\" comes with a tasty soup and an especially delicous serving of Chinese green vegetables in a succulent oyster sauce. All this plus a nice lime drink beverage will set you back no more than S$6.00 including, if you so choose, a tip.For truly superior Chicken Rice, venture over to Maxwell Road Food Court to Tian Tian's. \u00a0But for a very good version of the Hainanese dish that is more conveniently located for most tourists, Sin Swee Kee will do well indeed.",

    "text": "The Battle of the Swee Kees (part 1)First off, I'll be honest and say that the only reason we ended at Swee Kee was because Yet Con was closed. Secondly, for some crazy reason, we decided to try both Swee Kees to see (and taste) which Swee Kee reigns supreme, so this is a 2 part review, staring off with Sin Swee Kee. White (boiled) and Roasted Chicken Rice ($4.50 for thigh)At a glance, it did look very promising but the rice was a let down. While it looked really oily and flavourful, the rice was a little hard and didn't quite provide the same impact on the tongue as it did to the eyes. The flavored were decent but the rice was too hard to be really enjoyed.The white chicken was pretty decent. Flavourful and quite tender, although i did find the meat firmer and less smooth than others we've had. The roast chicken was pretty meh..... Nothing spectacular and for a thigh, it was a little on the dry side. Condiments: Now this is the saving grace of Sin Swee Kee. While everything else was pretty average, the chilli and ginger made all the difference. The chilli was tasty, a good kick of sourness and boy was it spicy! The finer was fragrant, oily and really help elevate the flavors of an otherwise very boring plate of rice. Soup of the Day ($3.50)The soup of the day was actually, surprisingly, pretty good. It really tasted of corn and red dates and complimented the rest of the meal very well. Overall, it's not the worst chicken rice we've ever had but it certainly doesn't stand out. Would give it a 2.5 at most but the condiments did help elevate this place to a 3. Don't forget to check out part 2 of the Battle of the Swee Kees in the next review.",

    "text": "\"Florence, you have to try Hainanese Chicken Rice when you go to \u00a0Singapore!\", said many. Thus, Hainanese Chicken Rice rose to the top of my list of things to try (eat) during my (very) short stay in Singapore. Not much time to search Yelp, a lack of knowledge of where I would be in Singapore, and absurdly slow internet the few days prior to when I would be there, led me to just following the crowd to where we would eat chicken rice. Sin Swee Kee is where I ended up.When I first walked in, I noticed it was VERY busy. It was lunch time, and it seemed like a lot of the patrons were businessmen/women on their lunch breaks. Busy is a good thing, so they must have VERY good chicken rice. Lots of locals, so their chicken rice must be good. My logic doesn't ever seem to fail me! Or so I thought. Our meal started off with the iced barley drink, which was probably the best thing I ingested in this restaurant. My parents told me to drink it all because it was good for you. Why, you don't have to tell me! It's delicious, I'll easily finish this up! We had a bigger party, so we ordered everything family style. We each had a plate of rice, the signature rice that is served with the Hainanese Chicken Dish. This, I thought definitely lacked the flavor and aroma of what chicken rice should have. We tried both styles of chicken, the roasted and steamed, and while they were both juicy, the taste of old-frozen chicken was just too overwhelming. Together, it just led to a mediocre dish. Now, I've only had Hainanese Chicken Rice twice prior to my meal here. The first one was a few years ago when my dad attempted this dish, and the second was the day before at Universal Studios Singapore. Universal Studio's overpriced theme-park quality food was almost just as good as the chicken rice from Sin Swee Kee. For my dad's first time trying Hainanese Chicken Rice a few years ago, I remember that being WAYY better than what I was served here. Besides the main chicken rice dish, our party had a few side dishes to go along with our meal. That included the Aust lettuce, sweet and sour pork, tofu with eggplant, and boiled bean sprouts. Honestly I enjoyed eating the side dishes more than I enjoyed eating the chicken. I guess I'll have to return to Singapore to find a much better place that serves a whopping Hainanese Chicken Rice!",

My gripe with most places that do roast chicken is that they tend to over roast it resulting in a dry fowl but Sin Swee Kee's was rather good. The rice too was quite good, not too dry or too oily. Not as fragrant as we would have liked but tasty enough. Soup was also quite tasty.Ambience : Spiffed up kopi-tiam with air conditioning option. Decent.Service : Quite good, staffed by friendly PRC wait staff. Only complaint was the price ... it was a bit steep at $5 per serving.",

At a very central and convenient location at Seah Street, just a stone throw away from City Hall MRT Station, it was easy to locate the place. There are also many parking lots along the side of the lot, making it easy for working individuals to do take away or have quick lunches.Although not meeting the standard of having the best chicken rice in Singapore, it was still pretty satisfactory, definitely better than the chicken rice served at hawker centers or food courts. The chicken was tender and juicy, the sauce was tasty and the chili sauce was appetizing. The only problem I had was that the rice was a bit too plain and lacked flavor. I ordered a cup of homemade iced barley to go with the chicken rice, and it was pleasantly refreshing. The service here is average though, but they do their job.",
