    "text": "Enjoyable space on the 2nd floor of Bugis Junction. I think the decor is suppose to be French, but there's also a bunch of mish-mash of things that had me guessing for a little bit. It was a comfortable, casual environment. Anyway, the menu has a pretty good offering of dishes, including escargot in garlic butter. The pork tonkatsu was moist but a little fatty for my liking. The panko crust was delicate and didn't leave you that oily mouth feel. The Tonteki pork steak was good too and pan-fried perfectly. The fatty parts had a nice char and the meat was tender and juicy. Usually, the Tonteki comes smothered in their \"Original Tonkatsu Sauce\" which I'm glad I asked for on the side because although it was tasty in a Worcestershire sauce kinda way, it would have overwhelmed the pork steak. Plenty of beer and wine selection to choose from. Didn't have room for dessert, but there is a large offering of it if you are so inclined to indulge in. The service was excellent throughout the dinner service, even more so than many other fancier places. There is a set lunch menu that changes daily. The entrees includes a \"healthy salad and drink\" it says. Great place to grab a meal, a drink, and/or dessert.",

I like sitting on the counter though, you get to peek at one the cooks are doing through a glass pane.Like everyone said, the decor of this place is super cute and cozy, modeled after a small B&B or something. They also play this adorable jazzy french music in the background.I got the sizzling hamburg steak since that seems to be getting rave reviews. It's not bad for $19.90. Tasty and fills me up - it comes with fries and a bed of bean sprouts. Kinda reminds me of a glorified pepper lunch. It was served in an interesting manner too - The waiter will pour some sort of liquid on your egg and burger, and it would light up for awhile before she pours another liquid on top of it to put the fire out.After serving your meal, your waiter will give you a key which you will then take to the cashier to pay your bill and \"check out\" of this lovely B&B. cute eh?",

Food is also quite consistent. Tried their famous breaded pork cutlet here and it's the same as the one at Clarke Quay Central. Their escargot is affordable and did not disappoint as well. So if you are around the area and you are looking for affordable french food, Ma Maison is it!",

    "text": "I am very late to the Ma Maison game thanks to general blurness on my part. Last year, while looking for places to eat on a Friday night at Liang Court, I stumbled across this strange French cottage-looking restaurant with tons of ladies waiting outside. Couldn't put two together and moved on. Earlier this year, after moving to my new workplace at Suntec, a friend suggested we have lunch at Ma Maison at Bugis Junction. When I walked in (once again, there was a line for lunch), everything clicked!I've only had the Ma Maison set meals with grilled steak, hamburg steak and tonkatsu because someone told they're really good at the hamburg. Why order anything else if a restaurant is great with it's grill right? All of those dishes have been fantastic, with the hamburg steak taking the cake no matter what sauce I've had it with. Plus if you're feeling thirsty, they have a good range of beers by the bottle and some very appetizing tarts that I've *yet* to try.What really rocks my boat however is the service. For Singapore standards, the Bugis outlet has some of the best service I've experienced in this country. From the usual embarrassing welcome you get at Japanese restaurants to accommodating substitutions, explaining sauces and keeping my water glass filled, the staff here get top marks. It's one of the few times I find myself saying, \"boy do the Japanese know how to train their service staff right\" because they all look happy and serve professionally. I do notice that the Japanese managers pay more attention to Japanese customers, but hey I would too if I was working in a foreign country and the \"less attentive\" level already exceeds most competitors. However, I would point out that service at the Parco Millenia restaurant is not great and borders on rude on occasion because, well you guessed it, there are no Japanese managers on site and the outlet seems severely understaffed. One can't have everything so I suggest sticking to Bugis Junction. Lastly, come early or past 1pm during lunchtime to avoid lining up for long. Forget dinner on Mondays (ladies happy hour) or Fridays if you're starving and don't want to wait.",

I guess I'd call it a mod-Japanese/Western dish, and this is pretty dang fantastic. Plus it comes with a sunny-side-up egg on top. And that sauce...I really should also tell you I had the company of the lovely ladies Kathryn B and Michelle L (now M) at lunch, and all I can do now is talk about this food... guess I'm not a very gracious dining companion eh?I think they'd agree that the food was pretty awesome, and the service deserves a good mention too - every staff member was available, without being intrusive, and for newbies, I guess the only odd thing was when one of the staff handed me a key as I asked for the bill. What do I do with this now? He told me to bring it to the cashier, and when I handed it over, it hit me - it's a kitschy form of \"checking out\" of the restaurant, and it completes the cottagey/B&B-themed experience.Decor aside (which really isn't bad), I'd go back for that hamburg...",

Not what I expected at first, although I'm not sure what exactly I thought it would be.The ambiance is quaint, with French themed furniture and finishings. The soft lighting and wood interiors really set the tone of a small French cafe.We started off with the Escargot, served in the shell, with a garlic-buttery sauce, which was quite good. Followed these up with Camembert Cheese Fritters that were also really yummy, although I would have preferred a different sauce, the one we had oddly resembled Thai sweet chilli.The Beef Stroganoff served with Buttered rice and omelette was a bit disappointing despite my love of Japanese rice. The omelette threw me off a bit and overall the meal could do without.The desserts were the real treat here. We ordered the Banana Tart, Mixed Berry Tart and Blueberry Tart ($4.90).The Banana was by far the best with a layer of banana cream on the tart base, topped with chopped banana halves, dollops cr\u00e8me and walnuts. Not my favourite for lunch but highly recommended for a bit of light tea and dessert",

I waited about 10 minutes to get a table today, which wasn't too bad, considering that it was \"Ladies Night\" on Mondays. 20% off ala carte items - score!The decoration of the place is lovely. The lighting's a little dim, but it adds to the cosy atmosphere of the restaurant. I had the Gratin with Prawns and Scallops ($13.80), which was pretty good, but they were rather miserly with the actual prawns and scallops - there were only two pieces of each in the large bowl. My friend had the Fresh Greens salad ($6.90) with Japanese dressing - I wasn't too impressed with that. We ended the meal with a Strawberry Tart ($8.80) - the most popular out of at least five different flavours of tarts - and it was not bad. However, the tart base was almost like a very dry cake which I feel did not complement the texture of the strawberries.Ma Maison is known for their sincere approach to food, and it shows through their simple yet delicious dishes. Their prices are also very affordable, so you can try a number of dishes without breaking the bank. It's my go-to dining option at Bugis Junction!",
