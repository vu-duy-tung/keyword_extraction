We ordered a large pepperoni pizza which is deff plenty to split for two people. The pizza was delicious and came out pretty fast. Price is reasonable for Singapore $24 for large pepperoni Ambience is nice, very casual and friendly. They have some outside seating as well. I'll deff come stop back in for another pizza :) Free wife :)",

If you are looking for good atmosphere, varied menu, good pizza, and reasonable (For Singapore) prices for large pizzas, this is the place to come.I haven't been to any of their other outlets, but this really has a good atmosphere, it feels like a true New York neighborhood pizzeria with the tile floors built around the large wood fired oven in the middle.They have a large varied menu which contains many great dishes, I've had their pasta and some appetizers in the past, I don't remember specifics,I was pleased and not disappointed. My last visit we did get the house salad, which had good dressing and was large enough for 2-3 people to easily share.The real draw to this restaurant, and the focus of their name is the Pizza. This is really good pizza, it isn't too fancy, it is just good pizza. They have a wide range of toppings and pre-designed types to order from including the traditional Pepperoni, which is always a good measure to judge by. The pizza is a hand tossed, thin crust, wood fired oven pizza; it has just the right amount of char on the bottom. The pizza is greasy on top, if that isn't appealing, take a napkin and sop it up as I have seen many do in other parts of the world. The table comes standard with napkins for this and utensils along with the usual, crushed red pepper and grated cheese to fine tune your slice the way you want.The $50 21\" is a great deal to ensure all are satisfied and you will have slices for breakfast the next morning, and if a harmonious consensus on the toppings isn't possible at your table you can always do a half and half style pizza. I advise making reservations as they fill up fast with families, couples, large groups and others looking for a good pizza night out.",

So with pizza you can't go wrong making it even if you tried, but to make good pizza....aha....Here in pepperoni, they celebrate the different ways of eating and enjoying pizza.I was tempted to do a Cindy Crawford pizza pull. (90s kids you know what I mean??) For Peperoni, its their speciality. \u00a0I ordered the pepperoni and seafood half and half 21 inch.Huge pizza, cut in quarters, it was lovely to my stomach and I'm loving all of it.The cheese is lovely but I think its a bit too much as I couldn't love the ingredients along with it.A lone stray hair came baked in the pizza but hey, its alright as the pizza is a pizza.I ordered a pasta - linguine in pesto... Its alright....not bad...little watery no oomph but cmon its a pizza place! So they're an aiight place to hang. A place to indulge in huge pizzas and Instagram it and get lots of likes*Guess how many times i said pizza in this review!.",

A tad too watery for my liking but still good. The must try is the funghi portobello con pollo. Just ridiculously good with a crispy and tasty batter. I'll be back.",

We visited the place for my husband's birthday dinner but was totally disappointed with the service. We waited for 45 minutes to be seated and when we are finally ready to order they just ignored us. The first girl I called just walked away and served other tables and went back to the bar counter to clean wine glasses. So I just called another staff \u00a0(old man wearing eyeglasses) but he gave me a sign of \"wait\" with his 2 hands raised. I was totally disrespected and we just decided to leave the place and we are never coming back!",

Made eye contact and asked for the bill a few times but was openly ignored. This was when there wasn't anyone else in the restaurant at that time during a late noon. The second time this year 2016, I was glad to see that service has improved, and the snooty manager was nowhere to be found. You kept a customer apprehensive to return for an entire year before returning. Good service matters, guys!",

    "text": "Peperoni Pizzeria's claim to fame is their XXL (21-inch!) pizza, and their versatility. If you want two kinds of toppings and can't decide on one - you don't have to! You can have both of them on one pizza. Isn't that neat?The pizza crust is thin, the toppings are fresh, the selection is vast, and put to the taste test, the Pancetta (Cured bacon, sliced tomatoes & egg) is delectable. The egg, still runny, goes perfect with the bursting-with-juice and huge slices of tomato, and the pork isn't like the typical American breakfast variety - still salty, not crispy, and tender. The selection of beers (Belgian!) is impressive as well - you have the leffes, the Satan Gold (oh la la!) and if you catch them at happy hour, you knock $2 off the price. Isn't that neat? Still a little overpriced even at happy hour - but worth it for the money you save on the pizza.Compared to the Greenwood Avenue branch, this has a more cutesy American diner feel, as compared to Greenwood's aged Italian pizzeria feel - but both joints have pizza with the pizzazz!",

The chicken salad was pretty good but had a little too much dressing. The minestrone was also quite good. The only thing I would gripe about is that most of their pizzas don't have fresh mozzarella. They also have a good beer list but it is not cheap. Their drinks are a little cheaper (10-15%) at happy hour which ends at 7pm.",

Reservations are recommended though as the place can get quite busy especially on weekends.Back to the food, the pizzas are baked in a wood fire oven and its something I really like. I guess it somehow enhances the flavour of the pizza. With the XXL pizzas, you can split them into 2 different flavours. I love the seafood and parma ham options. Their appetizers are pretty good too. It may sound weird but, do give their chicken wings a try. They're seasoned well and are really tasty. However, I'd say give their pastas a miss. I'd rather you spend your money on their pizzas.",
