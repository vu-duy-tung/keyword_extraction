My order arrived and the chicken was a bit raw.I immediately messaged them privately via their fb page. The owner/chef replied and told me to come by their branch which I did a few days after.The owner remembered me and to my surprise he offered a discount. \u00a0Everything went well - the food, service and all.So it will now be my after-workout- go-to-place from now on. Life is about giving chances anyway :)",

Wish I had tried this place sooner when I worked at the area. \u00a0It takes a bit long for the order to come out, but it serves one of the freshest and healthiest dishes in Sing. I tried the smoked salmon sandwich and immediately regretted that I only ordered one, and the thick and hearty avocado soup was one of the best I've tried. \u00a0They have combo lunches such as meatballs and chicken that come with pasta, broccoli, and roasted cauliflower, and salads that are simple yet unique in taste. D takes away dinners for me randomly as I crave this place on a time to time basis. The owner is usually always on site and he's been helpful in choosing the meals I want. highly recommended!",

    "text": "It has been a long time since I truly felt touched by honestly good food. \u00a0The moment I bite into the Kale and Mushroom, the cacophony of flavours simply exploded in my mouth without warning. Sweet, spicy, tangy......how can this humble looking sandwich taste so fabulous? I could not suppress my excitement and wanted to find out what magic has gone into this sandwich. \"It's Chilli flakes that we've infused into the olive oil and that tang comes from the clots of lemon milk juice cream you see on top of the mushrooms.\" answered the owner Traveen in a slow-paced Norwegian accent. Chilli flakes and lemon milk juice? WOW. This brilliant inspiration can only be found here at Smor, Singapore's first Scandinavian Deli that is opened by food enthusiast twin brothers Traveen and Tarun Gulrajani. They were so captivated by the concept of Smorrebrod (which means \"butter bread\") during their 3-month tour of 12 Scandinavian cities that they decided to bring it to Singapore, elevating to an artisan level with quality ingredients all sources from Scandinavia.  It is not only the quality ingredients that make this worth. Like the Kale and Mushroom, the Crunchy Bacon is piled onto buttery and crisp toasted brioche bread that doesn't turn claggy with the moisture of tomatoes. Topped with side eggs, wilted baby spinach and shavings of emmental cheese, this warm open-faced sandwich is a great breakfast choice that tickles one's fancy. \u00a0These sandwiches worked amazingly better than most cold pleasure-less wraps as they are prepared fresh upon order. The warm versions easily gain the upper hands as our palates acclimatize to the heat but the cold sandwiches are seriously not bad either. \u00a0Instead of mundane ingredients like cream cheese and capers, the Smoked Salmon has a lovely acidic-sweet kick coming from the horseradish and dill-infused sweet mustard dressing which I mistaken to be honey at first. Some might find the Norwegian hand-peeled shrimps to be tad salty but if you factor in the tangy lemon mayonnaise and the sprinkles of chives, it's a simple, refreshing yet addictive combo. \u00a0These voluminous seafood filling are stacked onto gluten-free light rye bread is resilient enough to avoid saturation from the extra moisture, yet still soft enough that it doesn't wear out the muscles as you chow into it. \u00a0This is probably also the only place in Singapore where you can discover a fair range of Scandinavian chocolate snacks, savoury produce like caviar or coffee. I bought the Jaffa Nougatine bar ($2.50), some really good milk wafers at only $2.50 and the Shuffle Toffee Biscuits, the sinful combination of snickers, Mars and Toackers that are worth the calories. \u00a0I have posted the Shuffle Toffee on my instagram hereWas it by chance that we managed to pick all four choices that were delicious? I seriously doubt so. Yes, the price of $6.90 for one sandwich, $12.90 for two and $17.90 for the Viking meal of three might seemed a little pricey or not satisfyingly sufficient for a meal. But trust me, a regular meal of two sandwiches are more than enough to fill you up. Moreover, if it's such a wholesome meal prepared with healthy ingredients, passion and sincerity, why not? \u00a0I seldom say that I will return to try the place but this I shall unabashedly say that a return is a must.",
