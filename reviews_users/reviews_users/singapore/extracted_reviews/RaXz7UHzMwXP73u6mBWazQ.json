    "text": "This is located in the Orchard mall - on the highest floor. This was another michelin restaurant I accidentally stumbled upon. The restaurant itself is pretty unique, it is a single floor space with 5 or 6 concept restaurants in one. When you are seated, you have the opportunity to order from the many menus. The michelin awards caught my eye and I got the Italian Ramen. It was definitely quite unique - I did not know what to expect. The closest thing I ever had to this was a cheese ramen I ordered in Culver city at Yamadaya and I was not a big fan of that.The flavor itself was pretty subtle and wasn't as cheesy as I thought it would be and that was definitely a good thing. Your mind will try to process the flavor as you take every bite and the proscuitto was a great touch to counteract the milkiness of the broth. I would definitely try it again",

    "text": "Quite an interesting concept, you can order from any of 6 different ramen joints at one shop. I had the shoyu ramen with yuzu, the broth was a mix of fish and chicken stock, and the noodles were made from whole wheat, so a little more absorbent than usual. The yuzu was a nice touch, and the pork was juicy and served in generous portions. Overall, this was quite a nicely done ramen, although it deviated quite a lot from the traditional style. Probably the best ramen among the few outlets on Circular Road. I'd like to come back and try some of the other ramen types.",

    "text": "This shop was so tiny, it can be easy to miss. We walked maybe 5 minutes from Raffles Place MRT along the busy Circular Road. There's 3 other ramen shops along this area so be sure to find the right \"Takumen\".It has a very cramp seating arrangement, maximum of 5 people per table? So do note, if coming in big groups that you will be split up! The shop seriously reminds me of when I was dining in Japan. The shops in Japan are so tiny, just like this!The Chibakara is one of their more famous dishes that gets sold out. Known as the \"Super thick noodles\", it reminds me of lor mee. My sister and I ordered this to share. I strongly recommend any lady who comes here to share. Their portions are HUGE!The shop is very considerate of ladies and provide hair bands for you to tie up your hair, to prevent your hair from falling into the soup.For those eating the spicy \"ma la\" Bingiri, you will be provided an apron, so that you don't split any of the \"ma la\" oil onto your clothes.1. Chibakara with Char Siew $23.90++The waitress asked if we wanted extra veggies, it's free so we said YES! We were not expecting a whole amazon rainforest in our ramen bowls. We also requested for the \"Japanese\" flavours, rather than the \"Singaporean\" flavours, which meant that our soup and broth were stronger. The char siew was soft and tender. One of the best I've had, unlike the ones you eat at Ramen Champion, whereby you just peel off the fat from the meat. This one, the fat is infused together, and there isn't too much fat. More meat than fat infact :)You can also order the normal chibakara for $18.90+ and get one slice of char siew. The noodles as you can see from the pictures, is that they're thick! They absorb a lot more of the broth than normal ramen. It is chewy and has a QQ texture to it.2. Bingiri 17.90++It was spicy beyond spicy. Your tongue gets numb from just eating this. It doesn't come with char siew but with minced pork instead. They provide you with two spoons to eat this. One for you to drain out all the soup and eat the noodles and meat. The other, is like a normal ramen soup spoon. The bowl was laced with onions! So beware those who do not like onions.3. Ontama $2++Instead of getting the normal hard boiled egg, I got the soft boiled egg instead. Strangely it was cold and not hot. But it was nice to spread it over the chibakara noodles, it added more flavour to the thick noodles.Chibakara with Char Siew and Bingiri were two huge bowls by themselves. Bring friends to help share the calories!The chibakara with char siew was on a separate bill, this was for two normal chibakara and the bingiri.All in all, an authentic japanese ramen shop. But I did feel very bloated from drinking just a tad bit of soup which had me reaching for iced water, which thankfully they serve to you.",

    "text": "It is ok. What is interesting is that you get 6 types of soup broth and ramen in one shop, so it can be a good place if you and your dining companions like different things. One can have his tonkotsu broth and the other a chicken broth.I tried the Sakutaya ramen which is a mix of pork and chicken broth, and comes with a special ramen that is thicker and thus much firmer than the usual. First thought when it arrived: the broth is so so oily! Yes, it is very full-flavored but it is also much too salty to my liking. The char siew is also nothing to rave about. I only ate one of the two slices served.For each ramen, they also have various suggested toppings. So note that the onsen egg is not always included in the standard bowl.The line gets seriously crazy at lunchtime. If you are a ramen fan anyway, come try it. But I think there are too many other good ramen places within walking distance from here to warrant a return trip for me.",

    "text": "This would have been a 2.5 stars if not for the gyoza. Pls chide me for coming to a Jap shop and craving for xiaolongbaos. The gyoza tastes exactly like one!! With the piping hot and delicious soup encapsulated within the dumpling. Place it on a spoon and take a bite of it. The skin is just so thin ala XLB and soup just oozes out nicely. Yum! (I can already see some raised eyebrows from Jap or Chinese in comparing their dishes. Take a chill pill bro)The ramen is nothing much to rave about. The soup is too plain and I had to add a lot of garlic and chilli powder. In fact, it was quite tasteless O_OThe chashu was large enough but just okay. It was cold! Tamago was well prepared with the yolk oozing out too. Noodles were moderately springy. There are many Jap shops nearby along circular road which I'm definitely going to try out. Not so sure about the ramen here though. The good thing - its one of the shops that open late.",

    "text": "It's interesting to see how ramen moves from reality to virtual space and back to ramen again. Japan's online ramen delivery store, Takumen, has launched its first restaurant not in Japan but in Singapore. Small, brightly lit and minimal, the space is just like a typical ramen-ya in Japan, minus the enthusiastic welcome shouts and loud slurping noises. It currently showcases the signature bowls from 6 famous ramen shops in Japan, each prepared from scratch by one single Japanese chef who has amazingly mastered all the secret formula and recreating the same quality to the smallest detail in the tiny kitchen.Ramen is hardly the lightest grub out there and this perfectly oily chicken-broth based ramen by Hajime is no exception. My mouth tells my brain to go on because the broth is pretty flavorful but my eyes tells it to stop because the layer of glistening oil globules is too conspicuous to go unnoticed. This is a dilemma that has yet been resolved but this is the most competitively priced ramen at $14.90. On the side note, the thick chewy noodles did not provide much satisfactory texture compared to the rest, though the \"Chicken Char Siew\" or chicken breast meat was indeed tender. Ramen Jiro is a ubiquitous Tokyo brand that has earned a cult status for its unmistakable mountain of vegetables toppings and eye-poppingly thick rounds of char siew. However, this Jiro-Inspired Ramen from Chibakara($18.90) looks wimpy in comparison and the meat was tough to chew on the rims, though there was still hearty helping of bean sprouts and sweet cabbage. After giving it a good toss, it does reflect a stark resemblance to our local \"Lor Mee\". Diners can choose to customize any ramen here for the healthier \"Singapore\" version (less oil and salt) and we decided to experiment with this bowl. Yet the flavor after customization remained persistently rich and mellow, and I could imagine how robust it would be if we had the original Japanese version. For the Tonkotsu purists at heart, Honda Shoten's Ramen Kurume ($15.90) proved a truly wise investment of calories. It's difficult to argue about the quality of the broth with this shop that hails from Kurume, the city that gave birth to the first Tonkotsu broth in Japan. The bowl is indulgently rich and full-flavored, finished off with two thinly sliced gelatinous char siew that would send you to porky wonderland. But the silver shreds of sour ginger pickles, sesame seeds and crunchy black fungus pulled everything back to reality, leaving a first-rate aftertaste. Can ramen ever be spicy? Yes, when the noodles are not doused simply with mild Japanese ra-yu (chili oil) but attempt a bold and dangerous affair with grinded Sichuan peppercorns that sat afloat the dark red broth. No, I'm not exaggerating to say that this Katsura-style Tantan noodles from Bingiri ($19.90) is a flavour bomb. The spiciness did not really hit at first but built up as I worked on it and my tongue eventually went into temporary numbness. Yet the heat was so addictive and I caved in again. One amazing fact is that the spicy chilli oil is intensified with not one but THREE kind of pepper and blended with soy sauce base instead of sesame paste. To put off the fire in the tongue, one can munch on the sweet crunchy onions whose supply seemed to be endless in the large bowl. Alternatively, top up $2 for that beautiful onsen (soft-boiled) egg, which really helps to mediate some of the heat. On the hindsight, the more commonly seen parboil egg was slightly overcooked that day. The basic version of all noodles here does not come with any soft-boil eggs or parboiled eggs. However, I doubt this is a major problem since most self-respecting ramen fans would not bear to miss it. A second outlet has already opened one day after this first outlet and given Takumen's impressive online inventory of over 100 ramen, it is not surprising if these prized 6 ramen spots will be filled up by new brands in 2015. I wait eagerly to see what will be up next.",

    "text": "I tried the Bingiri, and was pleasantly surprised by the pungent tongue-numbing sensation brought on by the generous amount of Sichuan peppercorns. The waitress asked if I'd like the pepper to be served on the side. I said sure, but ended up dumping the entire small bowl of crushed peppercorn in the broth. It reminded me of Sichuan Dan Dan Mian, and tasted wonderful. Sure the broth was oily, but it was rich and flavourful. Not the healthiest food on earth, but I don't think ramen is meant to be anyway. Service was very good. The staff also offered a paper bib to me since the ramen I picked is potentially a big threat to one's white shirt :)",
