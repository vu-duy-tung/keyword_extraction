    "text": "The ambience is quite clean and casual. The iPad you use to order from has a cover that is gross and honestlyy quite as dirty as a menu. It's a little hard to get attention from the waiter but they are helpful. The signature dish tenshin han is really filling. It's a huge omelette with rice in it. Nothing else. It's a BALL of a omelette. It's like our Singapore National Stadium. Its sauce is a slightly thick gravy with a \"savory sweet and sour\" taste to it. Also ordered a mix fry Togi. The egg and sauce was good. Meat was average. The fried prawns were all soaked and all soggy. I could get this kind of quality food from my polytechnic food court. Gyoza was fine. Surprisingly it retained its heat for some time. Most or all of the ala carte dishes here comes without rice. So if you're someone like me who needs rice, it doesn't make sense to eat ala carte here. Their ala carte seems reasonabke here and that may beckon you to enter. Say I ordered my mix Togi it's just egg and the fried prawn and chicken. No rice. Rice alone is $3 so it's ultra no value to order rice. Over here, never look at the ala carte price. Always look at the set price. Many good foreign restaurants who set up shop here, they just import a brand with a story from say, Japan that has quality and care and does the opposite while milking all it's worth here in Singapore. Here is an example of it.",

Go for the gyoza, not the best but it's way better than the ramen I had. The ramen broth is so plain it will take time for you to get used to it. It has a bit of alkaline taste from the noodle, followed by a soup made of salt though it's not overly salty like other places. The noodle is of the hard chewy variety and the two pieces of char siew are thick and not melt in mouth tender. Half boiled egg is hard. If you're used to the nicer ramen then skip this. You will be thoroughly disappointed. They charge $1 for a glass of water!",

The sets are good value as they come with egg drop soup, 3 gyoza and a generous bowl of rice plus a savoury dish. I like the gyoza which have the requisite crunchy bottoms and are well seasoned. One complaint I have is the last meal I had there everything was lukewarm. It was probably pre-prepped for the dinner rush. So watch it if you're eating at peak hours - avoid dishes that look like they could be preprepped.",

Pricing is quite reasonable at 6 for $3.90 and 12 for $7.80.I went for the Fuwataro Tenshin Han $13.90 set that also included 3 pcs of gyoza. Boy it sure looked fluffy and I guess there must have been 4-6 eggs in there. The portion was too much for me, I couldn't finish it at all. Would recommend 2 to share this.My friend had the fried rice which looked pretty good but was different from the rice in the tenshin Han. Will definitely give that a try next time.",

The gyozas are light, not too greasy, with lots of vegetables and garlic. Thin-skinned, but pan-fried so it's crispy on one side. They're not super-juicy, but the kind of gyozas where you can eat a dozen and feel \"healthy\" and still eat more. \u00a0They have a perfectly pre-mixed vinegar with soy sauce and vinegar. \u00a0We ate there 2 days in a row because the price was right, and the gyozas were yummy and felt healthy.It's not just gyozas. They have a set menus available: chili pork, ramen, fried chicken, Japanese egg and rice. \u00a0(About $10-$15 / set) A mix of Chinese dishes and Japanese dishes. Some sets give 3 gyozas, while other sets give 6. The rice is some special rice from Japan, and it is better than the white rice you usually get in restaurants.They now charge $1 for for a large bottle of tap water (used to be free), and they've taken a lot of items off their menu (mapo eggplant instead of mapo tofu.) There's more deep-fried stuff \u00a0on their menu, so it's not as healthy as before.",

In short, Osaka Ohsho, has screwed it up.The ramen is awful- as in really, really bad. The noodles themselves were overcooked, soft to the point where there was virtually no texture. The broth was bland, and the egg and cha-siu were mediocre. The gyoza which came with the meal ($15 set meal) were also a disappointment. The skin wasn't crispy, the skins of the gyoza stuck to one another, while the gyoza themselves fell apart when you picked them up (the part of the dumpling where it's crimped to seal were ripping apart when you picked it up). They also had one dish which sounds utterly amazing - Soft Shell chilli crab ($10). Imagine the possibilities with this dish, it's mind boggling! But alas, this could-be-epic dish comes up far short of it's potential. Poorly fried crab (i.e greasy) with way too much better, covered in a sauce which taste like sweet and sour sauce: yuck. My friend didn't even finish it after a bite or two. Given the options which are available at the plaza - skip this one.",

Quick and good, especially in this place which is chockful of office workers who need to grab a quick bite.The star dish here apparently is their gyoza and it comes with whatever set that you order. Pretty decent, quite tasty without the additional dumpling sauce, fairly meaty as well without too much veg and stuff in it which I never like. Ordered their Thursday special, the set with fried chicken and double-cooked pork. Fried chicken was a tad salty but tasty, the double-cooked pork (what on earth is double cooked? is that a good thing?) was more veggies than pork, and the set came with a bowl of sticky white rice and an eggy-carroty soup and 3 gyoza. My friend ordered the fried rice set - the fried rice was also quite tasty and hers came with 5 gyoza and soup.Decent place for a quick lunch!",
