    "text": "KenScale: 9.5/10The best meal I had during my stay in Singapore also happened to be the most expensive one. I wouldn't say that a more expensive meal would necessarily be the best, but the one I had at Waku Ghin was just absolutely fantastic. I would definitely say it's one of my all-time best Japanese meals of my lifetime. Located inside the famed Marina Bay Sands hotel (where I stayed just so I could check out the fabulous infinity pool) and helmed by internationally acclaimed chef Tetsuya Wakuda, Waku Ghin has long been one of the pillars of the great gastronomic scene. At Waku Ghin, you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve 10-course degustation menu, priced at whopping S$400 per person (thank god the dollar to Singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get!). The chef will bring a gigantic plate of all the raw seafood that will be a part of your meal. With that price tag, each dish really had to be worth every penny, which is a nearly impossible feat, yet Waku Ghin pulled this out beautifully. There were some really taste bites of seafood, from Japanese sawara (mackerel) that worked beautifully with eggplant and seaweed vinaigrette to slow-cooked New Zealand John Dory with grilled eggplant to roasted New Zealand scampi. One of the signature dishes at the restaurant, the marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served inside the sea urchin shell was pure nirvana, and I could seriously eat this dish any given day. The best dish in my mind, however, was the impeccable Tasmanian abalone that came with fregola pasta and tomato. It showed that the restaurant could also draw a page from Western influence, and I still can't forget the beautifully cooked abalone that worked wonders with the pasta. I was also deeply impressed with the braised Canadian lobster that came with aromatic tarragon jus. Lobster was as perfectly cooked as it ever gets, and the tarragon jus worked its magic to further add another dimension to the dish. An assortment of fabulous seafood was followed by some meat dishes. Deboned spatchcock (chicken) was well-cooked and worked harmoniously with black truffle. My only compliant with wagyu roll was that there was too little of it, but otherwise the meat's texture was absolutely juicy and tender. Following a serving of soothing somen and gyokuro (green tea), I was led to the main dining area where desserts started coming in. Tasmanian leatherwood honey ice cream with granite of lemon and gin jelly, a light and refreshing dish, was followed by Ghin cheesecake (\"Ghin\" stands for silver in Japanese), another winning dessert that I wished I could have more of. The restaurant has a classy and formal vibe but I still saw families with casual apparel enjoying their casual time together. The services of the professionally dressed staffs were attentive, and you can complement your meal with a variety of drinks from wine to sake to cocktails. Waku Ghin will blow your mind if you're looking for a serious Japanese fare with Western touches. I've always been impressed with the craftsmanship, dedication and discipline that Japanese chefs display, and while the glitzy atmosphere of Marina Bay Sands may make you think the meal at Waku Ghin is overpriced and overrated, it is anything but. Okay, maybe the price may force you to eat cheap food for the next month or so, but if you're looking for a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Waku Ghin is pretty damn close!",

There's both counter and tables at the bar. Ordered the steak. It was okay. The sauce was too sweet, which really did not help bring out the flavor of the steak. Normally I love sweet sauce on anything, so I don't know what they did wrong with this sauce. Just didn't go.Perhaps, the food is better not at the bar, but after this steak, I'm not dying to come back.",

    "text": "My life is complete...I ate off of the bar menu at Waku Ghin because the actual meal was definitely out of my price range. Even though the bill still came out to about $300 USD for 2 people, this is likely one of the best food-related choices I have ever made in my life. From the drinks to the food, everything was top-notch. Just as I thought I had reached ecstasy, the next bite always proved me wrong.We ordered 3 dishes: Lobster open face sandwich, sea urchin set on vinegared rice with caviar, Spaghettini with Alaskan King Crab & Tomato. I've sat around for 30 minutes thinking about how to describe these dishes, but I simply can't find the words to justify how good they were. The Spaghettini is the most ordinary and replicable dish here. The Lobster sandwich and uni/caviar were out of this world, and completely indescribable.We also had 2-3 drinks each. I ordered various sake cocktails, all of which required an amazing level of creativity to create. I have never seen or had sake cocktails in America, so this was refreshing and intriguing for me. My girlfriend ordered 3 fresh fruit cocktails. Each of them were blended into a smoothie, but were also unique in its own way. The passion fruit cocktail was blended with real passion fruit so the freshness of the fruit and the seed were all infused into the drink. The grapefruit cocktail had separate and distinct pulps that exploded in your mouth as you drink and popped them. The bartenders here really outdid themselves.I apologize for my inability to do justice in describing the food. However, I can confidently say that this was the best meal I have ever had - - which is incredible because the food was ordered off of its bar menu.",

We were a party of 6, had the omakase ofc, some v expensive sake, and 6xS$20 of still water?!?Overall i was dissapointed. Maybe I did not enjoy the subtleness of the 10 well-presented courses enough but honestly I was expecting to be wowed but in the end I came away with 3000 reasons why I could have eaten elsewhere for 5* food but much much better value.The uni was decent and the a5 wagyu was ok but everything else was sub-par and honestly not worth the $400++ \uff08don't forget gst + service) we paid per person. However our chef from Japan was a highlight in an otherwise mediocreally-supposed ta be-haute-gastronomic experience.Like the new hublot ferrari engine watch. Or not.O well. At least they had phone charger for my poor Android phone..*also was expecting like otoro or some other sashimi :(( but o well i guess u can't choose in omakase.",

    "text": "Waku Ghin is a great restaurant with a plethora of flavors to keep your taste buds busy. It will also make you feel as inflated as a blimp afterwards since it's just so much food. Also, be sure to set aside 3.5 to 4 hours to dine here, it's long. Took off a star because I was only wow'd by one of the courses and drinks are below mediocre. Most of the dishes are good, but not memorable. I've been here on two separate occasions. Once I came alone after a friend was stuck at work and the second time with my girlfriend on one of our first dates. You walk into the casino area of MBS and are pleasantly welcomed by the staff as they open the doors for you and and seat you to your room where you will sit alongside 2-3 other couples (was a bit awkward when I came solo).Your chef comes into the room and introduces himself along with what he calls the \"menu\", or simply a showcase of the fish that will be prepared for the meal. You say OK and move on with your culinary journey.Both of my experiences, I had essentially the same dishes (I believe it was the same season in two different years since the menu changes by season). I had the following (out of order unfortunately)1) Shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served in a sea urchin shell (their signature dish) - Excellent as one would expect2) Ocean trout with witlof and yuzu - Ok3) Beef with arugula - Simple but meat was cooked nicely4) Lobster in a garlic type sauce - This was very nicely done5) King crab leg cooked and covered over a bed of salt and bamboo leaf - This is the one dish that stood out for me. Easily my favorite and one I could rave about. 6) Live steamed abalone served with fregola - Pretty much your typical abalone dish but with a slight twist.7) Japanese Waygu beef slice with garlic chips and fresh wasabi - Nice8) Consomme with rice and snapper - Good9) Somen with myoga and junsai - Nice refreshing dish10) Honey ice cream with gin and lemon jelly - Sweet yet easy to eat11) Cheesecake - Unfortunately was just a cheesecake.My girlfriend and I both had cocktails which to me were both pretty bad. We even went to the bar after and had drinks there and they were mediocre at best. For a bar that advertises itself throughout the hotel, they really aren't that good. Wish we stuck with sake.After these experiences, I really wasn't that wow'd. Most of the flavors are those you can find if you have any of these fish at other restaurants, except the king crab leg which blew my mind. The setting and setup are all very cool but I definitely left hoping for much more that I didn't get and I can only imagine that these guys will get better. Most of the dishes again are good but not great and memorable.If Michelin came to Singapore, these guys would for sure be in the mix for a potential 3 stars since they fit the criteria but they need to build more dishes with truly unique and memorable flavors. Otherwise, I think it's worth a shot to try it out for the experience.",

The experience is without a doubt very expensive but the 10 course degustation meal was hands down among my favorite of all time. I am certain that I can't describe the plates any better than the previous reviews have. However, I can confidently say that the food tastes as good as the descriptions and pictures project.What stood out to me most though was the precision and attentiveness of the service. If you want to be left alone to eat a meal in the corner, this is not your place.

    "text": "Waku Ghin. Constantly one of frontrunners for 'Best Restaurant in Singapore', a meal there will set you back a cool $400++ per head, not counting water or wine. Even then, I'm going to say it's worth going at least once. Each course is a myriad of flavours and textures, all meant to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients in as dazzling a way as possible. The signature dish of marinated botan ebi, sea urchin, and oscietra caviar, is salty yet sweet, clean tasting yet rich. And amazingly, it wasn't even my favourite dish. Personally I felt that it was just a little too ostentatious, a little too opulent. The charcoal grilled beef served with mustard was real delight, the beef was full-flavoured and the smoky flavour of the grill lingered in the most teasing of ways. Every time a dish came in a broth, we ended up drinking from the bowl, because apparently spoons weren't always part of the dining experience... but the amount of time and quality of ingredients that went into each of those nourishing liquids must have been significant, because they were all packed with flavour.Dessert... was a little lacklustre. After the brilliance of the courses before it, the simple coconut mousse with mango was almost insipid by comparison, and a rather disappointing portion size at that. One thing I must highlight however, is that the service really impressed. It wasn't as subtle or unobtrusive as I've experienced at other top-class restaurants, but they did manage one thing that sets them apart from any other dining experience I've had in Singapore. They noticed I was left-handed, and proceeded to place all the cutlery as a left-hander would use it (opposite of the normal place settings). I've never had that ever happen in Singapore (overseas yes), and that alone redeemed the seamless but average service we received for the rest of the evening.",

Waku Ghin, translates to 'arise silver' and pays homage to Tetsuya's routes, offering a 10 course Japanese inspired degustation menu. \u00a0The restaurant is located in the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex, and offers a unique dining experience. \u00a0In fact, Waku Ghin was just voted in the 2012 S. Pellegrino Top 50 restaurants of the world. \u00a0Now, that's an achievement! The experience of Waku Ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff. \u00a0To the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge, perfect for pre-dinner drinks. Continue through the restaurant, and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway, with private Teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side. \u00a0Understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least, there is nothing ostentatious about the space. \u00a0Warm timber compliments features of slick silver, with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance , alongside glimpses of the Singapore skyline. The restaurant seats only 25 people at a time, offering 2 sittings each evening. \u00a0Guests are seated in private Teppanyaki rooms. \u00a0This evening, Mr J and I have our own personal Teppanyaki chef, dedicated to creating our 10 course degustation menu. \u00a0We share our Teppanyaki room with another couple, who also have their own personal chef. The 10 course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening, and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us. \u00a0I should also note, you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list. \u00a0If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, then you're not looking hard enough. With our wine and food sorted, we proceed to sit back, relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at Waku Ghin. Our menu:* 'Like Oyster' - Scallop with Daikon and Oyster Leaf* Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar* Grilled Tailfish with Japanese Matsutake* Pan-Seared Foie Gras with Kyoho* Australian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato* Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon* Charcoal Grilled Australian Lamb with Couscous* Japanese Ohmi Wagyu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy* Scampi Pasta* Gyokuro Our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat. \u00a0I can't help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive! \u00a0At least we know it's fresh! Our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish, one at a time, carefully explaining the dish as he goes along. \u00a0I love the personal interaction with the chef, and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal. Each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art, as a plate of food. \u00a0Each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated 'wow' coming out of my mouth! \u00a0Time and time again, every one of those 10 courses achieves the same reaction. \u00a0 Once our degustation is complete, we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert. \u00a0The room offers spectacular views of the Singapore skyline. Our dessert menu:* Cold Soup of Dates with Tonka Bean Ice Cream and Orange* Pistachio Ice Cream with Raspberry and Chantilly* Coffee or Tea and Petit Fours The desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening. \u00a0We are each presented with a personal menu, dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening. \u00a0A lovely touch and memento. Though pricey, dining at Waku Ghin is an amazing experience. \u00a0From the food, to the decor, to the service. \u00a0This is seamless top class dining. \u00a0This is an experience I am going to remember for a long time to come.",

    "text": "A place for high-rollersAt $400 per head before taxes, Waku Ghin is a big commitment even before you start your dinner. (And yes, they take your credit card upon reservation - if you don't show up, they deduct the price anyway). The set-up of the 25-seater restaurant is sparse and muted. The main element is silver (ghin), which apparently is chef's favourite. Diners perch on uncomfortable bar stools for most of the 2-hour+ /10-course meal before moving to the lounge to be served a sliver of dessert. Service is not up to par as expected - having told the receptionist that I was dining there on occasion of my birthday, we were greeted with complete indifference, not even an acknowledgement of the big day. No matter. The non-existent service throughout the meal at least meant we weren't bothered by inept staff. The food is top notch, comprising ingredients that are at the very top of their category and treated minimally at the teppan counter. The private chef - one to every 2 diners - does a show and tell for his dishes before preparing it, whether searing a piece of wagyu or cooking the abalone to the perfect texture. Some dishes are prepared in the kitchen, such as the signature of botan shrimp and creamy Hokkaido sea urchin. The customised teppan plate is truly the star - having your food cooked before your eyes does much to whet the appetite. \u00a0For normal folks, Waku Ghin is a one-time splurge, but high rollers apparently dine there weekly - so I guess the standard of the food will always be high. Just know what to expect (it's not haute gastronomy the likes of Restaurant Andre or Jaan) and you'll probably enjoy your $400 worth of prime ingredients, done well.",
