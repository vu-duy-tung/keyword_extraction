    "text": "Our go-to butchery in Singapore, and they recently moved just across the street! the new butchery is HUGE- it has a small outdoor playground for bored kids to play outside, while the parents shop their meat goodness for the week in a two-storey building with the elevator. \u00a0Not sure if we liked the layout though- if the butchery had more of a \"cozy\" and \"welcoming\" feeling, this new place seems more like a meat factory in an industrial setting and can get a bit confusing trying to find the entrance/exit. I usually get my cut of korean samgyupsal here (pork bbq), and steak to eat for dinner. We seem to get better cuts if we come earlier, as we had slices of the most tender steak one week, then a bit chewy and forgettable meat, the next. so come early! i deducted one star for having very little selection of organic meat available for my baby.",

No umph, no kick! Nothing remarkable. Dont get me wrong I enjoyed the food but it was not my favourite steakhouse . However, I can't say the same with service. At first they greeted us with open arms but when they came to realise that we were to stay abit longer, they grew impatient and gave us a sour face. Other than 3 stars from me~",

The only drawback in the whole experience is that the bistro service takes an eternity. The staff, although pleasant, can't be bothered to come to a table more than once. So make sure you get everything ordered at the first contact because you are on your own after that. The dedicated playground next door makes for a nice family experience.

(But if I had to kill my own meat to survive, I'd probably turn pescatarian. :P) It makes me happy to know that there is a quality butcher here in Singapore that I can rely on when I feel like being fancy by making my own steak.The store is in a great location, as it's the first thing you see if you exit Holland Road onto Dempsey Road. As fellow reviewer Mark D. said, it's quite pristine! The store is a well lit, organized meat heaven. When you walk in, you are greeted with a ton of beef, chicken, and pork to choose from- steaks, sausages, burger patties, you name it. I also like how the employees who work the counters are always attentive and willing to help. I've bought their Australian steaks twice and enjoyed them both times. Outside of the meat, the rest of the store caters to Western tastes. They have a small section for veggies/herbs, a decent selection of cheese, along with bottled beers and other condiments. The bistro is outside, so al fresco dining is your only option. My husband and I ordered their burger with gruyere and caramelized onions. To be honest, we thought it was just okay. We actually think Go-Go Bambini (also in Dempsey) has the better burger. If you feel you've eaten some \"misteaks\" in Singapore, then stop by here; you won't be disappointed! :)",

The prices were reasonable, but on definitely on the higher end of our budget - have I mentioned how cheap I am? We sat down for a bite before starting our shopping. We didn't come soon enough to get the chicken meal. Pretty darn Paleo, minus the fries which could be easily substituted. Instead, we opted for the short rib and my oh my, was it delicious. I'd still go for the chicken next time we're there (if they have it), but if you're down for a more indulgent meal, I'd say give it a shot. We had two ciders to go with our meal. I ordered a pear cider and hubby got the lime cider. There was beverage envy, but I was pretty stingy and didn't share too much because it was so good. We'll be back. This place's meats make me seem like an amazing cook. Bacon wrapped dates with a roasted, seasoned chicken and a side of roasted cauliflower? I could win any Paleo man's heart with this meal - luckily, I already have the hubby's. :)",

Nothing special.The butchery is a very pretentious fancy place for people who are okay with buying ungodly expensive meat. Yeah, yeah, the butcher can cut it any way you like but for that price he really should sing and dance for you as well. The quality of meat is not better than if you just go to a regular wet market (well, hello, it's Singapore, the quality is superb anywhere) but the variety is better. So if you wanna play a really rich Julia Child and go handpick some meat for your beef bourguignon and chat with a butcher then go ahead.",

    "text": "Butcheries are my favourite stores to visit, next to supermarkets. Fresh, great cuts of meat with all sorts of herbs, potatoes, tomatoes, onions to cook them with, this place is like a candy store to steaklovers - wait - like a butchery to a steaklover. Okay analogy lost, but you get my point. Feast your eyes, or have a US ribeye to devour at the al fresco bistro. Be warned though that the grill masters are rather inconsistent, sometimes a medium steak turns out exactly pink in the middle like it should be, sometimes it's brown and well done in some parts, and medium only in 20% of it. No one experience has been the same for me, but it's good enough for $28-ish, it scratches the itch without breaking the bank.They serve their steak the way purists like them, no sauce, some salt and with good shoestring fries and some greens. I've never paid much attention to anything else on the menu. I do fancy the french onion soup now and then, but it doesn't quite compare to the thick intense concoction (blanketed by gruyere cheese) that I've had in better French restaurants. Still, a bistro's a bistro, adjust expectations and you'll be a happy diner here.Note that bistro hours differ from the butchery's. Bistro's operating hours as follows:Monday: Closed Tuesday to Friday: 11.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. \u00a0Saturday, Sunday & public holiday: 9.30 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. Both butchery and bistro are closed on Christmas Day, New Year's Day and Lunar New Year.",

    "text": "One of the best lasagne I've ever had in my life, rich and packed with meat which is what most lasagne lack. I was after a beef lasagne but Huber's only had a chicken option on that day and I thought why not give it a shot. It is definitely a lighter and healthier alternative to beef, the chicken used is shredded and not minced which gives a superb texture especially with the pasta sheets and creamy cheese. I 've tried to request for the chicken lasagne recently but with no luck. Hopefully it will be available the next time I drop by. The name of the place is a dead give away but if you're looking for prime cuts of meat and their related seasoning, this is the place to go to!! From angus to wagyu, you name it, Huber's got it!",
