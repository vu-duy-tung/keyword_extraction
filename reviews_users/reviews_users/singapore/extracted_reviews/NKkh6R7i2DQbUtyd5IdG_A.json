The Bacon was cooked just the way I liked it--not too burnt/crisp plus it also tasted good. The eggs were just okay for me I guess. I sort of wanted my eggs a little more fluffy instead of runny. The Iced Tea was light and refreshing but it could have used more sugar though. Place has a very nice interior albeit a little smaller than the average. Price is okay for the food.Yes, I do recommend this caf\u00e9.",

It's got a great clean vibe, the staff are generally nice, and the coffee was decent.The food was particularly good, the croissant I had was flaky and light, and filled with runny scrambled eggs and smoked salmon. For a weekday lunch (it's within walking distance of the office), it was a treat.EXCEPT. The croissant was gone in I daresay 3 bites, filling and all, and a croissant sandwich and iced tea coming out to $20 dollars is kinda ridiculous. I was still hungry after that croissant too.I would really much prefer to give this place 2 stars, because the value here frankly is very off putting. But the food was quite delicious. Meh. Two and half stars, rounded up. So to sum, food's great, but you're really really paying more for it than you should be. A true Singaporean-style cafe then.",

    "text": "I'll confess I don't have a great deal of experience with Liberty coffee. I've never been able to make it down to the roaster because of their crazy sporadic opening hours and I haven't really seen it around town that much. But Flock serves it and I drank it. And so far I don't think it's to my taste. The roast just seems too light to me. If the coffee isn't coming through the milk strongly in a double shot piccolo latte then there's basically no point serving it in a milk beverage. Maybe my palate is that messed up from years of smoking but unfortunately it's the only palate I have.Otherwise I'm a fan of Flock, primarily for its quaint neighbourhood vibe and friendly service. As other reviewers have noted, staff are Singaporean (as opposed to 40 Hands) and while I have no problem with Filipino service, I do appreciate an outlet that will pay more for inexperienced locals who actually care about what they're doing. The staff at 40 Hands have never seemed particularly interested to me.The proprietor seemed like a very nice lady who cared enough to serve & speak to customers with a smile. And again, unlike 40 Hands, there was no smug 'we-are-so-successful' vibe about the place. Plus I hate the 40 Hands coffee so this is a step up.While I like their famous pork cheek, it usually feels a bit too heavy for me to take as a first meal of the day. I plump for the prawn & avocado sandwich. I am particularly amused by the Turkish bread they use because it makes me feel like I'm in Melbourne circa 2002. Remember when Turkish bread was a thing, guys?",

    "text": "While spending a week in Singapore I quickly zeroed in on Flock as my go-to place for a morning cappuccino. The barista is well trained and takes the time to do it right -- it can take 5-10 minutes to get your drink but you can be sure it's done perfectly. I think the cappuccinos here are probably closer to what you'd get in Italy than some of the better places in San Francisco since the coffee beans used here are on more of the delicate side and the milk used tastes more creamy than what is normally used in the US.For food their banana foster french toast is one of the best french toast dishes I've ever had (a big surprise). The bread used looked like a standard loaf but had the buttery flavor and partial texture of a croissant. Served with a light maple syrup and topped with bananas and served with bacon, it was just fantastic!",

My husband swears by their French toast with bananas and bacon, which comes with two nice thick slices of eggy fried brioche, sliced bananas, crispy bacon all drenched in maple syrup! The sweet and savory combo wins him over. For me I always end up with the pork cheek sandwich. I agree with Marcus L, a little bit more toasted would be great. But once Ive sunk my teeth into that porky, cheesy, oily goodness I forget all about it. The small salad that comes with it lets me delude myself of it being pretty healthy. Not managed to try much else at this cafe, I like that the seats are reasonably spaced out and I always manage somehow to get a table. So just based on that sandwich and French toast, will keep Flock cafe as my default place to go.",

    "text": "Flock Caf\u00e9 is one of the more unassuming players in the thriving Tiong Bahru cafe scene. Somehow it feels genuine and laid-back, which can hardly be said for nearby establishments like Forty Hands and Open Door Policy, both of which have amassed loyal cult followings (quite deservedly) and lost their chill factor in the process. Well I suppose crowds are a good thing for cafes to have, though it would be nice to be able to have a meal without feeling like I'm in someone else's way all the time.These crowds were absent from Flock when we visited one Saturday afternoon for tea. Bit of a welcome change from having to wait in the sweltering heat for a table. It wasn't that the eatery was devoid of people - there was a steady trickle of customers, and the staff looked hard at work.Portobello, mozzarella & rocket sandwich, $13.50 - Since this was supposed to be tea we ordered one of their sandwiches to share. T'was a pricey sandwich, but I liked that the juicy portobello shroom was so big it occupied the entire pocket of ciabatta. This was quite delicious and would have made a substantial lunch for one, though y'know, the pig in me wishes they had fries on the side.They have other interesting offerings on their sandwich list like prawn and avocado, as well as pork cheek and gruyere.Orange bundt cake, $5.00 - Having had a disappointing encounter with a bundt cake the week before, we decided to give the orange bundt cake here a shot. I thought it had a nice citrusy fragrance and crumbled quite satisfactorily, but the others found it to be a little too dry.Mocha, $6.00 - Flock sources its beans from the ever-reliable Liberty Coffee, which pretty much ensures quality coffee brews. The mocha we had was frothy, chocolatey and every sip was laced with a pleasant hint of bitterness.In line with their philosophy of providing a \"deliberately relaxed\" ambiance conducive for weekend catch up sessions between friends, Flock was modestly, yet comfortably furnished and I loved the warm lighting. The food here is above average, and it's a lovely place to spend a lazy day, as all my weekends tend to be. Wouldn't mind coming back at all.",

    "text": "The latest addition to Tiong Bahru's coffee offering, Flock serves up good coffee and delightful sandwiches alongside salads that will tickle your taste buds. A little bird tells us that the meals have been devised by Singaporean master chef Jimmy Chok so that should give them additional foodie cred. \u00a0I love the fact that it's staffed by Singaporeans as well, unlike some of the joints in the area :)Worth a shot and yes, don't miss their cakes and baked goods. I have a soft spot for their pecan pie muffin!",

Excellent coffee and Great 'cheeky eggs' (eggs Benedict with pulled pork, English muffin, rocket and hollandaise) great size portions and well priced. Easily would have given 5 stars. Now though has lost its flare. Smaller portion size served on toast (no muffins) with tomato and lettuce on the side (no rocket). no change in price, makes it not good value and a big disappointment to be honest. Such a shame. Hope it goes back the way it was so I can change to 5 stars.",

    "text": "I don't drink coffee. Therefore, it is not surprising that I've yet to visit the \u00a0coffee-centric hipster joints. Nope, not \u00a0Chye Seng Huat or 40 Hands or 3 Hands or no hands (in fact when we drove out of the carpark at Moh Guan terrace I only realized that 40 hands was around the corner from Flock). We decided on Flock because the dude wanted AM brunch and we try to explore new places on the fly. Flock has all the elements of a coffee-centric hipster joint (this kind of sounds like I'm describing the Manic Pixie Dream Girl): Gentrified neighborhood, check. Bare concrete or exposed ceilings/fixtures, check. Food sources labelled (albeit in this it's ba/cakeries not farms), check.Prices that make me double take, check. Servers that look like my brother's friends, check.Kids in clothes that are like \"This? oh I had this ol' Cambridge satchel at the back of my closet\", check.We ordered a scrambled eggs & bacon croissant-wich and the croque monsieur. The first sandwich kind of worked but the chef needs more practice doing a scramble (heat control dude!). Parts of my eggs were fully cooked and parts were liquid. Without jumping in the kitchen, I'd say go have the big breakfast at Food For Thought to see what I mean by a good, even scramble. The rashes of bacon seemed to be lifted straight out of a packet into the pan because they were all stuck together. The croque monsieur was again, passable but kind of eh compared to the mother of all ham sandwiches at Choupinette.Decent meal delivered fairly quickly. Chilled out environs. The coffee-centric hipster joint experience.",

    "text": "Lovely caf\u00e9 located in the midst of the older HDB flats in Tiong Bahru. My colleagues find this place extremely overpriced, but what trendy place in Tiong Bahru isn't?I've only stopped by once for a small meal. I tried their quiche and cappuccino. The quiche wasn't life changing or Yelpworthy, but it was served warm and was perfectly portioned for my not-so-hungry stomach that day. The cappuccino met my standards (taste-wise) and was quite pretty, latte art-wise!I love the ambiance here; for some reason, I didn't find it as cramped as 40 Hands, around the corner. The natural lighting (my favourite!) is great, and they also have covered outdoor seating, which is perfect for a rainy day.Overall, another great spot for enjoying a bite to eat, a latte to drink, and perhaps an occasional Instagram selfie (as much as I hate them, it's amazing how natural lighting + a filter works wonders for a tired face!)",
