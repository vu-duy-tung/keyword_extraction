    "text": "We chanced upon Da Luca via a search online knowing that we will be in Novena area, didn't even have time to read reviews. Decided not to take any chances and called to make reservations. Boy... Were we glad that we did. Upon arriving 5 mins after, groups of families and friends started to stream in. Seriously, this quiet hidden gem of a restaurant is doing well on a Monday night!! I loved the fact that the restaurant had an over-enthusiastic manager that made my bf and I feel at home and comfortable. At that instance I thought to myself, this was going to be a wonderful experience. And I was right! Our orders included: 1. Starters - Fried calamari- Honestly, It wasn't love at first sight. But upon tasting it, it really was quite good. The batter had to be light to bring out the freshness and sweetness of the calamari. Anything heavier it would have not done the poor calamari justice. 2. Mains - Hand made Tagliatelle with wild mushroom and minced beef sauce - Ok people this is worth every calorie! The taste of the porcini mushrooms infused beef sauce was just the bomb! Not to mention, the hand made eggy tagliatelle was al dente, complemented the sauce very well! 3. Mains - Penne with crab meat in light tomato sauce. - The crab meat with the light tomato sauce was pretty good too but I wished it would have been lighter in taste with bigger chunks of crab. This was just ok for me as I had better ones else where. Overall, I had a great time! Homey, Good service with good food that's affordable, what's not to like. The only thing I wished was that they had ample parking. Best way is to park at United square, then walk towards where the taxi stand is (near toast box). Take that exit, and walk towards the building to your right, It'll be the closest to the restaurant. We will definitely be back to try other dishes!! Good stuff!",

    "text": "Made a reservation at this Italian restaurant near united square for dinner.Our reservation was for 8.45pm and we came at 8.15pm. We're told to come back later as no table - understandable as we were early. However, when we came back punctually at 8.45pm, we were told to WAIT FOR ANOTHER 10 MINUTES?!?!?!? I thought we reserved already?!?!? What's the point of reserving if we still have to wait even though we reserve?!?!? My \u8001\u7238 (old dad) very angry leh!!Even after waiting for 20 minutes, still no table and even worse, waiter who did not allow us to have table at first denied not allowing us to have table. He 'swear to my parents, it wasn't me' \u00a0Lie to us, still dare to swear to parents?!?!? Come on lah!Overall... Come on!!! Lie to us, don't reserve table for us even though we call to make reservation, 'swear to parents', made us wait over 30 minutes beyond our reservation timing, and so many others!! Never coming back again!! Please don't go unless you want to be treated like this!!!Note: if the restaurant can prove otherwise, this post will be deleted",

Maybe I was there on an off day but the pork chop was disappointing, the lamb rack was so-so. All 3 pastas we tried were also passable. We went there for the chilled angel hair (off the menu item) and it was probably the best item of the night and yet it did not live up to its hype.Also found the pricing high even though the portions are quite generous.",

By the way, if I am not wrong, it's 85 per serving which you could split into two. The other dishes are also super awesome. You must try to burrata + egg starters!",

    "text": "A friend who lives in the area asked me if I had ever eaten at \"Daluca\", via email. I replied, \"You mean the chain from New York spelt with an \"e\"? Never liked paying so much for sub-par sandwiches\"Thankfully my buddy responded, \" No. Come to Goldhill plaza on Saturday. It's Daluca\".So there we were last night, at Da *space* Luca, a little Italian restaurant run by a rather quiet Italian lady. We had the 300g burrrata ball to start, and that came with some sweet slices of tomato and lightly cooked spinach. The cheese was especially fresh and bountiful, easily satisfying the four of us. For mains, I had the squid ink spaghetti special (with cod fish and shrimp in a tomato sauce), the dude had stracci with braised rabbit (I've never come across stracci before but it looks like a cousin of ziti) and our two friends- in-the-know had risotto with truffles. All the pasta was homemade and fresca, which while i don't like comparing restaurants, made Da Luca a contender with La Nonna. The risottos smelled and tasted really good. However, both our pastas seemed a little under seasoned \u00a0and hence, flat. This could be totally fine for someone else because I do like stronger flavored food at this point of my young life. I did like that all the seafood was fresh but somehow the flavors didn't sink in with a punch and I had to do the salt & pepper shake. We unfortunately felt the same about the house glasses of red (a chianti) and white wine, which is sad because I remember tasting some great wines in Tuscany on my travels there. We tried half the dessert menu (tiramisu done with sponge cake, apple tarts and ice cream) and it was fine.The great thing about Da Luca is that they serve Italian portions with the freshness you'd expect from a true blue Italian and I appreciate that. Prices are reasonable too. The food will make most happy but doesn't knock your buds out of the park. In other words, great choice for repeat visits, maybe not for that special occasion (and that's probably the more profitable way for the restaurant to go anyway!).",

    "text": "Based on what I've seen on other diner's plates, the good people at Da Luca are very free with the quantity of food they provide. There's a wide array of succulent Italian dishes on the menu that include pastas, pizzas antipasti and desserts. Space is a tad limited but it adds to the overall feel of the ambience. Wait times are relatively decent, save for dessert, as the staff seemed a little confused to who's having what. And prices aren't sky high as well, which totally caught us by surprise as we had expected to spend a little more, considering the quantity and quality of the food. Overall, it's a decent place to check out and enjoy good, authentic Italian cuisine.",
