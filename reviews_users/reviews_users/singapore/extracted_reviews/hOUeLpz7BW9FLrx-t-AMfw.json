    "text": "Thoroughly overrated I believe. Brotzeit offers your typical German fare with sausages, pork knuckle and sauerkraut. It seems like novelty in Singapore, but honestly you could go down to the butcher and have your own October fest at home, with better beer at least. Brotzeit serves house beer which is really poor and flat. I had 3 gulps solely to quench my thirst. The pork knuckle in general fascinates everyone but be warned, the meat is not tender but tough. It is only the skin that is probably enjoyable as it crackles with every bite. A place worth a try to silence the surrounding hype.",

It's an outdoor (but covered) Restaurant open till pretty late in the evening. As you can tell from th name Brotzeit is focused on German cuisine and serves a solid array of German beers...pilseners, wheat, darks, etc.For lunch, I tried three items on the Karneval menu...the chicken schnitzel sandwich, fish and chips and chicken strips. Both the chicken dishes were quite good with the chicken being quite tender and tasty. The fish dish which used sea bass was a little on the fishy side for me. The fries were perfectly prepared and pretty tasty too. I also snacked on one of Brotzeit' famous pretzels which was served warm and darn tasty as well. Service is pretty good and you are never rushed. A good place to kick back and chill after shopping at Raffles. I look forward to my next visit!",

The menu was extensive with lots to choose from and with the holidays approaching they had lots holiday inspired dishes. I ordered a glum wine, even though it felt like 100 degrees outside. Inside it was actually pretty cool, even in the section which would be considered outside seating. The fans keep it a pretty nice temperature. Only problem, your food cools quicker. I got the jagerschnitzel which was good. Different then I expected but still good. I was expecting it to still have all the breading with the mushroom sauce. It wasn't really breaded. The mash potatoes reminded me of my Oma's so that was great. I enjoyed eating here. I'd definitely eat here again. Their wurst dishes look amazing. And if you're a beer drinker there's a lot to choose from.",

I did not really eat here (those cold plate platter does not count) but I would think the food quality should be more or less the same as other branches. How wrong can you go with bratwurst and sausages? Besides the beer options, there are wine and mocktail and other non-alcoholic drinks. If you are a light drinker or not that into beer, the mixed beer option is good. I like the Russ'n which is Weissbier mixed with lemonade. There are other fruit mixes which should make the drink equally sweet. So non-beer lovers rejoice when beer/alcohol drinker friends suggest going to Brotzeit, we have something to drink there besides coffee and tea and soda.",

We each had a portion of everything. As expected, the pork knuckle was nicely deep-fried. The assorted sausages also tasted good. Generally, I personally preferred the chicken ones over the somewhat porky-tasting ones. The lighter ales are also my favourite! I like how drinking much light ale just gives me a light buzz. I also discovered another drink that I now LOVE - J\u00e4ger bomb!!! This is another dangerous drink as the sweetness of the mix gives you the deception that you can down a plenty without getting slosh! Ladies, know your limit, else boys will gleefully take advantage of that situation. :/",

The service is a bit hit and miss here, the Vivo City location is a bit better there. Sometimes I just need a nice 'meal from home' and the dishes from Brotzeit are the ones that come closest except I cook myself.Pork Knuckle is pretty good, one of my favorite dishes however are the Nuremberger Sausages with Sauerkraut, mashed potato and potato salad.I find this to be excellent price/value compared to what they charge at Brauhaus at Suntec. Also, Brotzeit now had branches in other countries like Hong Kong and Vietnam. I tried them and the food here in Singapore has been the best so far. I guess sourcing the good ingredients is much easier here than elsewhere.One thing I do not like is that the kitchen closes pretty early. Recently I wanted to order something at 11 and it was impossible. However they told me that only AFTER ordering beverages. Fail!Enjoy ~~S",

I'm not a beer person - but even I found their beer and cider pretty okay.What I Love: Their Spicy Potato Wedges are yummmyyyy. I've also tried their Spatzle and J\u00e4germeisters - which are really good! The Salon fillet was fresh and yummy too, the ambiance is really nice - and I usually just enjoy sitting there and soaking up all the energy and people-watching.What I Don't Love: Their prices are pretty steep. I had a couple of drinks with friends, each of us had a main, a tiny starter - and the bill came up to $238? The drinks are nice but for $15 a pop - you can't be chuggin' down much.",
