I opted for the carbonara which was just creamy delicious goodness sprinkled with bacon. My dining companion has the veal which was a slimy over tenderized mess with overcooked vegetables The desserts were brilliant - wonderful ice cream, well made coffee. It's a pity that the service and food slide so much when the owner's not there. He spent 20 years building a brilliant restaurant and the minute he's not there, it just slides.",

    "text": "It was easy to make reservation via chope.sg. Service was good (with the waiters filling up our water glasses and refreshing the plates) but the food portions were way too small. We had the spinach ravioli which was ok but for $20+ for 10 pieces of ravioli, didn't feel like it was value for money. The Beef with a chocolate and wine sauce was interesting and cooked well. However, after 3 dishes, we were still let hungry and ordered another 2 mains (and received some remarks from the service staff about the number of dishes we ordered). I really didn't like the duck ragout pasta dish as the pasta was coarse. Overall, i left the place feeling underwhelmed.",

Brought a cake for the celebration and upon arrival were told that there was a corkage fee of $60-70 for the cake (I can't remember the exact amount). Extremely annoyed that the person taking our reservation didn't inform us of this charge given the party size and considering its not very common in Singapore (or maybe I only eat at Chinese places). Left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. On to the food. Some people in my party really liked it. I thought it was meh, inferior to Ah Bong's Italian. Pasta was overdone probably to suit local tastes. My main beef is that they used really crappy, tasteless, farm-raised shrimp for their seafood dishes. For the love of God please stop this practice. I wouldn't mind if they raised their prices and used actual quality ingredients.",

Service is discreet and they threw in a complimentary tiramisu for my partner's birthday. Their menu is very reminiscent of the traditional restaurants in Italy that I've been to.We had the prosciutto con melone as an appetizer followed by the ravioli con carne & the stracci ai gamberi e capesante. To be honest, I found the fare to be of average standard. The highlight of the dish was the succulent scallops. The pasta was fresh but not done al dente like I had anticipated (though to be fair, the rumors had me expecting Italian style pasta). The sauces were pretty heavy and overwhelmed the taste of the pasta for the most part - something I'm not used to. Still, thanks for the service with a smile even when my partner and I were the last to leave on a late weekday night :)",

    "text": "Here to celebrate our anniversary with my favourite cuisine. Read from other reviews that the service is poor so we braced ourselves. When we arrived, we were seated and the restaurant was only running on 20% capacity for lunch. During ordering, staff was helpful to give advice on the food items. I was pleasantly surprised with one of the service staff who over to fasten a back cushion for me. That's awfully sweet of him to go to that extra mile for me. Grilled Eggplant - tender slices of eggplant grilled till soft and then served with melted cheese and tomato sauce over them. Perfect starters!Calamari - I think this dish fell short somewhat. The batter was soft by the time we ate them and though the serving size was quite generous, I found the calamari rather bland. If not for the tomato dip that accompanies the rings, it would totally tank. I won't order this again. Ravioli Con Carne - this is our best pasta dish of the meal! Little pillows of soft beef dressed in a strong tasting cheese sauce, something like blue cheese but not. Just really yummy lah!Before our Squid Ink pasta arrived, we were both offered bibs that they nicely secured on for us. I supposed if the black sauce splatter on you, it'll be quite a nightmare to remove. So thoughtful!!Squid Ink Seafood Pasta - quite a big plate of pasta that is a whole plate of Nero (that's Italian for black) goodness. Seafood is fresh and generous in amount. The squid ink sauce is very flavourful and every mouth of al dente pasta a party in the mouth!Spinach Ravioli - very good ravioli with tomato sauce. Not that this is not nice, it IS but this dish does pale in comparison to the other 2 pasta dishes. You can opt to have a half half of the Ravioli pastas on the same plate. This is what we did so we got to taste more without being too full!!Tiramisu - a nice generous square of cake. You can really taste the rum in it (nice!) and with the mascarpone cheese cream, a wonderful slab of heaven to finish up the meal. I dunno why so many complained about the poor service because we have enjoyed very good service, not just from one service staff but all round really. Will definitely be back to savour the rest of the menu!",

This is definitely a local take on Italian food. But unlike Pastamania, which is so intentionally terrible that just thinking about it risks sending me into a fit of rage, this was actually pretty good.The ribollita was just not following that recipe, it was much closer to a minestrone. The seafood stew was almost as good as the Cioppino at Cicheti, The eggplant starter was a highlight, although I am not sure if they use Italian mozzarella. The minced beef ravioli was good like everyone says. The chocolate lava cake was worth it.",

The aroma and decor instantly brings you into the mood of Italian cuisine. Just before I go into the food, I'd like to commend that the service here is fantastic, fabulous and fawesome!The pasta served is surreal and yet tastes as down-to-earth as it gets. If you don't get what I mean, it means you can't say its anything out of the ordinary yet it tastes fantastically good, legendary in fact.This is definitely one of the more accessible (in terms of price and location), welcoming and affordable best pastas you can find in Singapore.

The owner is good to talk to, they'd be happy to suggest you dishes in a no-nonsense way. Don't expect to be pampered here, really. The food is amazing. We had ravioli and risotto, both amazing. The third dish (ordered on the owner's recommendation) was something the likes of which I'd never had. It was basically two massive sausages on lentil (dry version of the indian Dal). Very interesting. Indeed. LIn short, the place offers you a great evening, is centrally located, and is much bigger on the inside than what the facade suggests. Not to forget, it's not overly costly.",

One of the nicest Italian foodand definitely looking forward to try again the squid ink spaghetti with seafood which went well with Barolo. Service rendered was perfect and quick, staff were very attentive to our needs as well. It is located within walking distance from Tanjong Pagar Mrt so location wise was a good choice.Just a warning before you start ordering your meal, the pastas here are quite hearty and filling so maybe side orders would not be an added option. As silly as it sounds, i have never tried any risotto dish in Singapore before so i was keen to try it here. I ordered the Risotto Al Funghi Porcini, which is Arborio Rice cooked with Porcini Mushrooms, White Wine & Parmesan Cheese simply scrumptious. That changed my opinion of risottos as i thought it was a meal with bland rice and it was supposed to be dry.Overall i think i may visit this restaurant again for the variety of pastas that they offer.",

The bread that they served up was also quite yummy, and went particularly well with the garlic butter sauce of the prawn dish.For mains I ordered the ravioli with minced beef and gorgonzola cheese - they warn you that it's a blue cheese before you order, which is probably good for those who aren't that familiar with the cheese names. the ravioli was quite good - definitely for cheese lovers though!We were a little stuffed by then so no dessert, but overall quite a charming place for a decent Italian pasta meal!",

I have a bad habit of ordering the same thing off the menu over and again - but only because it was really good the last time. I usually start off with prosciutto accompanied by slices of rock melon - not exactly the most challenging culinary feat but they always manage to get really sweet melons that pair nicely with the sharp salty taste of the meat slices. For mains, I am hooked on their squid ink pasta. Probably not the best choice if you are on a first date and hoping to impress. The last thing you need is to look like a giant squid self-imploded in your mouth. If that isn't an issue with you, tuck right in. The sauce is never over-powering and the squid slices are never rubbery - a fine balance that few achieve. The interior of the restaurant is warm and cosy with its dark wood paneling. A perfect location for a date or a long languorous dinner with friends.",
