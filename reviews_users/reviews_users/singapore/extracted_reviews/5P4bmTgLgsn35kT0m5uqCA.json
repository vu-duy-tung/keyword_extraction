    "text": "Medzs has been a regular spot for us because it's a 5-10 minute walk and offers enough variety to please any crowd. It is located in the basement (B2) of Orchard Central. You walk in through a variety of different counters with all kinds of different Mediterranean and European foods on your way to being seated at a table with a menu similar to one you'd find in a sushi restaurant. You record your order on the menu and flag down a server to enter it. The place is pretty big and offers quite a bit of seating. It's good for groups and kids. The bar has been hopping on the weekend evenings we've been there, which is largely in part due to their 1-for-1 drink special. As folks following a Paleo diet, we're definitely fans of the Badger Cider. We're always pleased with the variety of foods that fit our lifestyle and we normally fall back on Medzs when we're looking for comfort food that isn't a cheat. We'll most likely be bringing any picky-eating family members here when they visit!",

No queue during Saturday lunch as the place is large.Four of us had the tapas platter (23.90), eggs benedict ($14.90), lamb tajine ($16.90) braised lamb shank ($26.9), rosti with sunny side egg ($9.90), lamb shish kebab ($17.90), la opera ($7.90) and hazelnut feuilletine ($7.90). Yeah, we're big eaters.There's LOTS of variety (in food and price), so there's bound to be something for everyone. The lamb tajine was the best dish, though the spices were slightly one-dimensional. I'd give the la opera a miss next time. You'll get a better rosti at Marche, and eggs benedict - the brunch special - is probably the best value for money.We paid $33.76/pax.",

    "text": "Medzs is a Marche-styled restaurant, meaning that there are many stalls inside selling different types of food, and you go around ordering from them using an electronic card that registers your purchases. With such a wide variety of foods, it is preferable to go in a group so you can share the items around.Medzs specialises in Mediterranean food, which means lots of seafood. They also serve pizzas and pasta if you're not a big fan of seafood. \u00a0The drinks section also features a large variety of milkshakes, fruit juices, and daily specials - if you're health-conscious or would like a palate-cleansing beverage, this place will attend to your needs.Being a big fan of paella, I ordered a seafood paella for $14, and collected it after 10-15 minutes of waiting. The rice was nicely coloured and cooked - not mushy, not crunchy. The sotong and prawns did not have any fishy smell and were cooked relatively well. Overall, the dish was pretty decent for the price range (I wasn't expecting amazing quality if I paid under $20 for paella in Singapore, and would have been pleasantly surprised otherwise).The ambience is cosy, with warm Mediterranean colours and decor. Tables tend to be spaced out, meaning that you don't have to jostle for space with the people at the next table. It also makes for a more relaxing experience.",

    "text": "Medzs is a 200 seater European/Mediterranean restaurant which is located at Basement Two of Orchard Central. I always walk past the restaurant when heading over to yoga class. The place works like March\u00e9, which uses a card system to record your orders. There are 8 stations which provide a variety of cuisine from French, German, Greek, Turkish etc.For S$15, i thought the Duck Confit wasn't too shady. S thought that it was kinda pathetic for such a small leg at first but i'm not expect huge ones like those served at Le Bistrot (read about my review here). You get what you pay for. Surprisingly, the leg was cooked nicely. The skin was a thin golden brown crisp that crackles when you bite into it but the meat maintained its tender and moist texture. The meat may be a teeny bit leaning towards the salty side though. The sauce was a savory gravy that gave the meat a little more moisture. This is not a bad dish and it is almost comparable to La Petite.I had the Beef Shish Kebab (S$11.90), which IMHO is fantastic. Piping hot and fresh beef on skewers, seasoned simply with spices, herbs, pepper and salt to bring out the natural flavors of the meat and served on a bed of vegetables. What more can you ask for? I love the Bulgur rice (If i wasn't mistaken) which was served with the meat. It has a nice tomato flavor to it and cooked almost like the Valencia Paella style with some diced peppers and onions. The short fat grains are fluffy, moist and slightly chewy and they go perfectly with the savory grilled meats. I would definitely be back to try the other kebab dishes. They look and smell fantastic.",

    "text": "A good place to go to if you are with a group of friends in town and need somewhere for beer and nosh. (Beer being the priority, of course.)The place offers a wide array of beer and I was happy to find many of my favourites displayed by the bar. That's not all, the beers are also super cheap if you purchase them by pairs. Food-wise, there are \"stalls\" representing cuisine of different countries like France, Turkey, etc. I was craving for some good meat so I ordered Beef Shish Kebab from the Turkey spot. Also had grilled chicken with truffle butter from the France spot. The food was decent, not noticeably rich in flavour or spices.Good strategy to carry out: reserve a table, grab a couple of bottles, go make your orders, collect the buzzers, return to table to continue on beer and wait for the buzzers to light up when your food is ready. You also get 10% off the menu when you check out before 10.30pm, which was a pretty good way to clear off most of the crowd before they close at 11pm.",

    "text": "My friend was out of confinement for NS and needed some special food, and he wanted to come here. HUGE fan of Mediterranean food, so I gave in the idea almost immediately!Got the Beef & Apple Tajine ($15.90), which was a 'claypot' of some light yummy stew, hoice chunks of beef, and served with a pretty small dish of coucous. No complaints about the taste - pretty above average stuff (although a Moroccan restaurant on Haji Lane would probably do one that tasted better), and the part of this experience that saved the experience from being just a meh-day out would be the desserts!The pastry chef won my heart, with her explanations on the desserts, and her generosity with the chocolate & vanilla sauces. I had the Caramel Pound Cake ($3), which was a thick slice of caramel-based pound cake, with almond ganache (which she adds when you order, for freshness), and the chocolate sauce sealed the deal. A taste of it and you could tell it wasn't your run-of-the-mill chocolate, but dark, heavy duty stuff. Delicious! Food is pretty meh, but the dessert counter won my heart over!",

The restaurant is spacious and would easily fill around 200 people but the interior design and deco could have done more to give the Mediterranean feel.There are many stalls for you to choose and you can consider a few dishes to start with . The duck confit , and kebab. However it could be because of the Mediterranean style of cooking, the food tasted very salty and the rice does not really match their kebab. If you are a fan of rosti, you will be starving as they really cook real slow. It took about 40 minutes to cook and serve. Overall, food is expensive and serving is not worth the money. For such an exotic taste, it only means that you need to be adventurous for the day.",

The food is laid out by country, with food from Spain, Turkey and France just to name a few.

The style at Medz is a little like Mar*he, but serving a slightly different variety of food. It would be best if you go with a group of people, say about 6, so that you can get a variety of dishes and share them. What's more, at Medz, there are lots of credit card promotions that give you special discount. Also, their 1-for-1 bottled beer deal is pretty attractive as well. You can not only get local beers, but also imported beer from different countries, such as Korea, Japan, Germany, etc. One thing to note is that there is no reservation after 6pm. So get your buddies and head down to avoid the long wait!",
