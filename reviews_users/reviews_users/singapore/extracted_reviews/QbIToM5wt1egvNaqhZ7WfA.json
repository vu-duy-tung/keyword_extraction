It's great. And get the drink specials, pretty good prices for Singapore. The Margarita I had was tasty. I didn't have it, but the raw seafood tower looked fantastic.Other reviews said its Japanese/Asian or not authentic Aussie. I didn't notice. Its Singapore. All restaurants have an Asian influence ....Drop by, chill out, have drink, and some nice food.",

We had fish and chips and the food was fresh and good. After our meal we walked around further and there's so many places to eat. On hind sight I would have liked to have gone to a different restaurant just to try the different local dishes. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but their menu options I could have gotten at home.",

Taste is slightly above average but nothing to talk about. Staff is rather attentive but not open to feedback and defensive upon comments. Bought Groupon Vouchers for the Lobster deal but was utterly disappointed with how it tasted (virtually no taste whatsoever) and the lobster flesh was tough. Ordered the mussels and clams but the meat was the size of a Singapore Five Cent Coin.Just terrible experience. Won't ever head back.",

    "text": "Apart from the decor channelling the laid back, carefree vibe of Freo, Perth, there's nothing else that I really like about Fremantle Seafood Market. Their Sunday brunch menu looks more Japanese than Aussie to me with its spread of king fish Hamachi, yellow fin tuna, chilled shrimps, half-shell scallops and mussels with lemon cocktail sauce.The ingredients are fresh, and there are certain stand outs like the squid tempura and soft shell crab. But had i known it would be so Japanese-centric, with all the sashimi, I'd have skipped it and gone somewhere else instead.",

But I could not believe it when I received my fish and chips. I was practically eating batter the entire time. The fish was pathetic.Never again will I go back.",

    "text": "Sunday lunch = $70 for two peopleI spent three years working at a seafood restaurant in Fremantle, so think I am qualified to write a review of this place. We came around 1pm on a sunny Sunday, as I have always wanted to try this. It got a fairly mediocre review from the Business Times, but then most Western restaurants do. Started with the jug of Heineken ($34.13) which is the usual Singaporean style of price gouging on beer. Moved on and ordered the Seafood Bucket ($28.25) which was well presented in a metal bucket and piled high with fried items. Unfortunately, most of it was chips, the fish was a relatively small piece and not a quality filet. The oysters were decent, but you could taste that they were either frozen or leftovers from Friday. There were also a mussel or two, some squid and I think a scallop. Disappointing because if you get this dish right, it is the perfect meal to share.Also ordered the bread basket ($8.24) and I am not sure how you can make bread taste so average, get some flavour! As you will see from flipping over the menu, this restaurant is owned locally. They have probably been to Freo on a recon mission and mimicked it here, the difference is that the seafood restaurants get really fresh items, and you do not need to drench them in batter to make them taste better. Lastly, your prices in the menu should reflect GST and service charge - anything less is cheating.",
