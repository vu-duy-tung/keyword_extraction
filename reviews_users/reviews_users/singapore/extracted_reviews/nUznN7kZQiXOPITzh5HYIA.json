I arrived before 5pm and there were already patrons having their meals. I guess they do open earlier than the stated timing. Will certainly return again to try the other dishes.",

Also had the coffee pork ribs which has a nice coffee aroma. Besides these, the other dishes - veggie / fish / meat are all \"ok\". They are also known for cockles \u00a0which look quite good though we didn't order ourselves so can't comment personally \u00a0Service is sub-par - they really hurried us out and turned off the light where we were sitting when we called for the bill...Overall ok food but unless you happen to be in the area, wouldn't bother going",

    "text": "Unassuming from the looks of it but Two Chefs Eating Place serves up good dishes that betray its humble settings. Tasty tze char dishes on offer here with a couple of signature dishes. I love the cold drunken cockles served with all that soy sauce, garlic, scallion, and chilies. So simple yet so gratifying. If you're wary about cockles, then this might not be up your alley since they're served chilled but it's really good. The butter pork ribs are also quite divine. Tossed in this cereal mixture that reminds me oddly of milk powder, the ribs are tender and the butter coating gives it a sweet and savory taste. We also had the drunken prawns and the hotplate beancurd and they were both delightful dishes but by far the stars were the cockles and butter pork ribs. Not much for service but the food is good. We came late at night so no wait and it was nice and cool out. Highly recommend stopping in Two Chefs Eating Place for a late dinner with some gratifying tze char dishes.",

    "text": "I was quite excited when one of my ex-colleague mentioned that there is a new eating place in Rail Mall that is worth a try out. Springleaf prata is tuck in the quiet corner of the mall facing the abandoned railway tracks. I came to realize its existence recently even though it was opened since last Novemeber, serving an extensive, unique and delicious Indian Cuisine in its menu.In fact, this Halal Certified Indian food Chain has opened up one more food option to the Muslim pals staying nearby.Drinks accompany our food will be none other than Teh O Limau Ice & Rose Syrup.Teh-O-Liamau & Rose Syrup - $1.80 & $1.40Being curious with alot of unfamiliar item out of the usual Indian Cuisine Menu, we ordered the Murtaburger which name sounds like Murtabak and Burger to me.2013 Murta Burger - $7Taste was amazing and I only come to know about that this is actually a good marriage of prata with our well-liked \"Ramly Burger\". Ingredients include mutton patties, mayonnaise well hidden inside the usual squarish egg prata. It was a moment of joy to see plenty of my favourite sticky mozzarella cheese while tearing up the prata. Not only was it delicious, \u00a0its crispiness of the prata had make me feel delighted.Filling up part of our stomach with Maggie Goreng that looks plain and uninteresting. Taste wise, it was nothing out of the ordinary but the dish came with generous chunks of chicken cooked together with eggs, beansprouts and vegetables, couple with cucumber and chilli as appetizer on the side.Maggie Goreng with Chicken - $5$1.10 for a piece of prata? What's the market rate nowadays given for the price from a air-conditioned shop in a mall? I bet this pricing is relatively acceptable especially when its plain prata is so crispy and goes well with the curry gravy. Yummy!Plain Prata - $1.10Service and food serving speed is acceptable. With a few well known prata places in the vicinity. the stood up among the rest with their specialties. I forsee myself coming back for more.",

Ordered their signature butter pork (4/5), fuyong omelette (3/5), hor fun (2/5), mapo tofu (4/5), and stuffed you tiao (2/5). Most of which we ordered were medium size and large for hor fun. Sufficient serving for 4-5 pax. Cost about $55 for all the above.Its location is rather unique and in an old estate. Everything around feels rustic and also a lot of elderly residents hanging around. Try to get to the car park which is the same \"level\" as the coffee shop, it has free parking on weekends while those on the \"upper\" ground are chargeable. Believe they are blocking them for the residents living in the area.We were there early (545pm) on a Tuesday and ordered take out, they were prepared fairly quickly. Heard it gets really crowded later in the day.",

Recommended to eat at this place with a group of people!I had one dish, which was the Milk Powdered Pork Ribs with rice. I had lunch at about 1.30pm here, the place was relatively deserted. Serving time was relatively quick as well. The dish itself was quite interesting! The milk powder seems to have been fried and isn't simply just sprinkled over the pork ribs, hence you wouldn't have to worry about any moisture over coagulating the powder. The sweetness of the milk powder goes very well with the fried pork ribs. I highly recommend not to order this dish if you're having a sore throat or dislike dry dishes, because this dish really does sap the moisture out of your mouth.",

Their butter ribs are still a crowd pleaser, but are served cold, for the past three months I've been here. Most of their other delights, are now unfortunately not as delightful. Sauces are starchy, loads of sugar used, nothing seems like it's served hot anymore. They will try to push to you the \"herbal wrapped chicken\", avoid it unless you want to drown yourself in mass produced bland soup.",

    "text": "This zhi char place is definitely one of the best I've been to. They come up with original recipes on top of making your usual zhi char fare, so there is a great variety of dishes to choose from, and they are all very well done.We ordered the usual dishes such as... kang kong - which was super spicy! The prawn paste fried chicken was tasty but nothing special in my opinion. The shrimp omelette was very tasty and flavoursom, and the deer meat with spring onions was tasty and tender. But dishes are the norm. Well cooked and tasty, but their signature dishes are something to rave about.I love cockles, but I am very particular about them. I dare say that this place serves my favourite cockles dish - served cold and drenched in an intensely flavoursome sauce made with fresh chilli padi, garlic, and chives.Instead of the normal butter pork dishes every zhi char place has, they also have a milk powder version of the dish. I know it doesn't sound great, but I found it less rich than the butter pork and a lot more palatable. It can't be too healthy, but the flavour and texture you get from the milk powder is really something else.I really enjoyed their home-made tofu with mushrooms. It had a nice thick sauce with minced meat drizzled all over it. The texture and consistency of the tofu was lovely and I couldn't get enough of it. Definitely worth coming to eat here I say! I'll be back to try their other dishes, and I'll update you all with another review then!",

I was intrigued, and read about it. Then finally one day I got to check it out with them! The scene of invention? Two Chefs Eating Place at 116 Commonwealth Crescent.It is a regular tze char place. According to their signboard they only rest for 2 hours from 3pm to 5pm. This place is a 10-min walk from Commonwealth MRT, but it can be quite difficult to find if you are taking a taxi. Have a map in hand if you are trying to locate this place, or go with someone who knows about it.With that special dish of milk powder butter pork which I have never seen before elsewhere. It is also always very packed during dinner time but the people are very efficient at seating everyone and serving the food, which is good. Every other dish seems average only compared to the butter pork, but pricing is on the higher side for regular tze char so be prepared. I guess there's a premium when you have a USP to bank on.",

    "text": "There always seem to be a long queue and usually when that happens you can't get seated until everyone's arrived, but it's so so worth it!There are four staples that I ALWAYS get when here. Start with the cockles - even if the thought of having them raw irked me a ilttle but I love this enough to get myself a hepatitis B jab so I feel safe chomping down on these babies. What really makes it so good is the sauce with lots of garlic, so make sure you drown your cockle in it before throwing it down the deep end!My favourite is their three egg spinach, with salted, centuy and the normal egg, a dish I began to notice was in restaurants everywhere, but only after I had it here. To date I still find this the most well done, with such a yum \u00a0gravy you'd want to get rice with it. The butter pork is an absolute winner. It seems to be fried pork ribs (boneless) buried under a mountain of milk powder, yet the powder is so sweet my friend guessed that it would perhaps be condensed milk powder, if such a thing even exists? But the novelty and goodness of the powder aside, the pork ribs are fried perfectly - not too thick, not fatty, very crispy...it is best eaten hot of course.I also always get the golden mushroom beancurd, even if it has disappointed me on a few occassions. It's essentially those japanese straw mushrooms in a thick minced pork sauce, a little sweet but very full of flavour.I have genuinely never thought I'd need to try anything else.",
