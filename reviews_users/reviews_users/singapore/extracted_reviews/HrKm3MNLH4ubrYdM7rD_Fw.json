We had the seafood paella, which was decent, only real grouse I have is that the prawns were mushy (not fresh), and then churros for dessert.I really to want to complain about my strawberry sangria - I have not had a more stupid drink. There was strawberry pulp in the drink - yum, and then there were tiny pieces of citrus with the peel floating in my drink. I had to fish out the citrus pieces with a spoon, then drink my drink so I could enjoy my drink. Not a very smart bartender.Service was okay, but my companion was asked if he'd like a refill of his beer, and the refill never came.",

It was absolutely gross. If you eat here, they additional charge is for the view and not the food. My husband loved the view, so we got couple of drinks and sat here. The tapas were definitely frozen and I called on it. They said the we won't be charged for one of the tapas. But I still think it's a shame to serve frozen food and charge $20 for it. It's meant to be a high end place. Our total bill for nearly $80. I don't think this place is worth that. Don't waste your money. \u00a0If you go to the top floor of this mall there is food republic. It's a food court type of setting but they had much better food than here.",

    "text": "I was in a bit of a dilemma reviewing this place because I went with 2 vegetarians and one person that didn't eat pork so I couldn't really try all the stuff I wanted. But the bottom line was I found it to be way over priced for what you get. I'll start with the atmosphere. It was nice, comfortable, cozy and sterile in a mall restaurant sort of way. \u00a0The service was ok. Not that friendly but they were attentive and did their job. \u00a0The food had some ok and some misses. \u00a0The hard part is there was a lot that looked good but I didnt try any of it. \u00a0The brussel spouts were ok and garlicky. \u00a0The best dish by far was the vegetarian paella which had nice flavor. \u00a0The worst was the pan con tomate the literally was just bread with crushed tomatoes spread on it. It really lacked flavor and wasnt what we were expecting at all. \u00a0The oxtail stew was tasty but way over priced considering it had 2 pieces of oxtail in it. \u00a0Another thing that annoyed me was that they charged everyone for tap water. \u00a0People were drinking and eating food but they were kind of snobby when people asked for tap water. \u00a0Given how expensive everything on the menu is you just get the feeling they are trying to scam you. It just didnt feel like a friendly place. \u00a0Maybe it was just a bad night. Maybe if I had gone with other carnivores it would have been better. \u00a0Really the menu looks great but in the end it felt flat. Meh.",

    "text": "I had the Cochinillo Asado (roasted suckling pig) that mummy booked ahead of time. The manager approaches the table with only a plate and proceeded to cut the whole pig with it - yes it's that's crispy, that's what he's trying to say.Not only was the skin ridiculously delicious and crispy (\"su pok pok\" as the lady serving my siew yok in a Chinese restaurant would say), the flesh was surprisingly tender, very different from Chinese suckling pigs. I was in awe.The grilled calamari is also true to the authentic Spanish of cooking very good seafood: as little seasoning as possible so you can taste the ocean. Paella was very good as well with great soccarat (the slightly burnt crust of rice), something that eludes most paellas I've had.I didn't foot the bill for this one and so didn't feel the pinch, if any. But the food is pretty good, if not one of the best, as far as the local Spanish scene goes, so I'd probably willingly shell out the money.",

    "text": "Decent, semi-authentic and WAY too overpriced Spanish food. This place has bombarded us with email ads in the past weeks and we finally decided to try when we went to Vivo city. Their tapas are expensive (mostly around $20) and of tiny portions. We shared four between the 2 of us and went away hungry. As for the taste, it was alright but nothing to shout about. The \"grilled Spanish squid\" was the biggest disappointment--it tastes like greased rubber. The mushroom in olive oil & garlic and the roasted potatoes are good, but honestly, how could one go wrong on those? The roasted peper stuffed with minced beef was nice too, although I don't think it's particularly Spanish (nor are the rest). We were sitting at the patio, facing the bay & Sentosa. It was breezy and pleasant. Service was commendable as well. But the price is really ridiculously high given the quality & portion of its food.",

The menu has standard tapas fare, with most priced at ($12). Calamares a la plancha is a must try on the list with the tender pieces of grilled squid served in a rich balsamic sauce, sweetly tempered with cherry tomatoes and finely sliced asparagus. Something else to try on the list is alb\u00f3ndigas ($12) which features beef meatballs in a tangy tomato sauce. For mains, we got the paella valenciana ($40) which is no doubt one of the better Paellas i've had in Singapore. It comprises of saffron, chicken, Spanish chorizo, tiger prawns, squid, half shell mussels and is well mixed with rice. The generous portion is for 2 but 3 can share it too with other side dishes.",

    "text": "Serenity hardly sounds like the name of a Spanish restaurant so it didn't cross our minds to have Spanish food until we happened to be in the vicinity for a late dinner pre-midnight movie.The staff manning the reception looked friendly and welcoming so we decided to take a chance, and were pleasantly surprised when upon perusal of the menu, realised that several of the dishes including the recommended paella and salmon papillote were amongst those in the Singapore's Top 100 Signature Dish Awards.Food : We got the seafood soup which was pretty good, rather generously filled with fish, mussels and prawns. Instead of the signature chicken and chorizo paella, we went for the seafood paella instead, which was also one of chef's recommendations. Both were commendable. We also tried the iberico ham and the churros, both of which were fairly average.Service : The staff were fairly eager to please but being seemingly filled with inexperienced students, weren't very up to scratch. Pleasant enough though.Ambience : Not too bad, we sat inside but we could still hear the live band and singer quite well without it being noisy and intrusive to the point that we couldn't hold a conversation.Definitely will return if I have a craving for Spanish cuisine. We wanna try the sea bass baked in salt and many other dishes! :)",

    "text": "I was in vicinity and wanted to treat myself to some spanish tapas for lunch, then I found Serenity. The menu was really alluring, I might have gone abit overboard for a lunch for one.I had the gazpacho as a starter - gazpacho is a cold tomato soup, its a common spanish appetizer. It was refreshing but also surprisingly slightly filling after awhile, I could taste the fullness of the tomato and the freshness of the cucumbers. You won't like it if you don't like cold dishes coz it comes really cold.For my tapas spread I had the grilled squid drowned in olive oil and the fried cheese. The grilled squid was simple but lovely. The fried cheese was my favourite. So sinfully good - it was nicely crusted on the outside and once you put your knife or fork through it, you can immediately see the gooey cheese inside - heavenly!Final verdict: I had an enjoyable solo lunch here in serenity (in all sense of the word, coz I was there on a weekday afternoon, there was no crowd) but I also took quite a hit on the wallet, it was quite hefty for a meal for one! Might only come back if I'm coming with a group or someone else is treating!",

I went in a large group of 10 people and most of us ordered drinks, but they wanted to charge us for those who did not order drinks and wanted a glass of plain water instead which was ridiculous judging from the fact that we were paying more than $40 per head for our meal.Some of the food that were still edible were the ham and melon, paella, fideua (pasta that is cooked like paella), baked fish in salt and sangria. Definitely need to do your homework to research on the menu items before you decide on what to eat for your lunch or dinner.The service rendered there was really bad as well, we waited for about 5 minutes before we were served and it was not really crowded at that point of time. I did not like the layout of the stall as it made the place look cramped and messy, the walls and spaces were curvy but the tables used were of square shape totally did not match each other. Will not go back if i can help it, i think pastamania serves much better food with a cheaper price.",

One of the tapas includes bacon wrapped asparagus which is more like a Japanese Yakitori dish which you could easily get for $2 or less at Tori -Q. \u00a0The next big let down was the much hyped about Paella, it was so dry and flaky. I honestly don't know how a good paella should be but if that is it then I guess I am not a fan of paella in the first place. Really disappointing service and exuberant prices!
