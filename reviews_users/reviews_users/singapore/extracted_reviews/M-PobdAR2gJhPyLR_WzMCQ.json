    "text": "This place was always the \"GO TO\" place for me and my parents whenever we felt like some South Indian food since I was young! (This place has been here for quite awhile indeed!)This place sets the standard for a wholesome Indian dining experience, both foodwise as well as the dining environment.If you're looking for something \"upscale\" or of posh restaurant feel that you can impress your date with then I have to say look elsewhere NOW! But if you're looking to have a comfortable time and not having to mind the volume of laughter and voice levels of yours or others, eating in a very long communal table with your hands (optional) along with strangers, this may very well be the place for you!Many tourists and locals alike come here for dinner indulging in their famous curry fish heads where caucasian tourists seem very amused with! Their menu is extensive and food quantities are huge!Everything on the menu is tasty! From the Northern Indian Tandoori Chickens, to their yummy butter chicken, chicken 65, naans, free flow of rice and vegetable sets... the tasty list goes on and on!Prices are reasonable and while there are many other places to go where the food and environment may be even nicer, like I mentioned, this place definitely sets the standard where indian food should at least be! Definitely still a \"GO TO\" place if you're visiting Singapore and feeling like some hearty indian food without extremely hurting your wallet in a mediocre indian food place in let's say, hmmm.. somewhere like MBS perhaps? :PP.S - Service can be a bit iffy at times although there seems to be many staff pacing around, so my advice is try to remember ordering all your stuff the first time round so you dont have to try to get the attention of the workers walking around so fast and \"missing you out\". Ask for the extra ice waters to come first, more veg/rice if you need while they dish it out for you, that extra small free bowl of fish curry you wanna dip your papadums in all the first time round - then sit back, relax and watch them all come!3.9 Stars",

Rasam could have been bit spicy with more tomato taste. Vegetables they served is excellent and cooked well. Payasam - is not that great, they should work on it, too much of kesar powder in it. Ambiance \u00a0is good and I see lots enjoying the food and Indian Tender Coconut water never thought they will provide like this. - in One word - Fantastic. Will come back here soon with my Dad and he will definitely enjoy!",

    "text": "This place is featured on all the travel programmes for a reason - the fish head curry is fantastic! \u00a0It's nothing like a typical Northern Indian curry...although it does use the typical curry spices (curry leaf, cumin, garlic, chili), it also uses South Indian spices such as tamarind, pineapple, ginger and lime leaves, which give it a sweet-and-sour flavour. \u00a0I don't know what species the fish heads are, but they're delicious. \u00a0A \"small\" portion is more than enough for one person. \u00a0The meat falls off the bones and is superbly tender. \u00a0You get rice for free, but I paid extra for an order of plain naan to sop up the sauce and I think I made the right choice. \u00a0Bring hospital gloves: the sauce does stain your fingers, and if you have a hangnail or a paper cut and the hot sauce gets in it, it hurts like no one's business.The place is always crowded and there can be a wait out the door, but the staff are good about turning tables around quickly.",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner with a friend at The Banana Leaf Apolo on Race Course Road.This is the second Banana Leaf Apolo I've visited. I've also been to and reviewed the one on Serangoon Rd. \u00a0The experience at the Race Course Road outlet was similar but not exact. I actually consider it slightly better.Quick comparison between the two - The Race Course Road outlet was much busier. \u00a0I like this. \u00a0It makes a meal feel more like an event. \u00a0The ambiance, while not upscale, at Race Course Road did not feel as much like a food court. \u00a0Overall, I would also give a slight nod to my enjoyment of the food there. \u00a0The samosas were completely different. The Serangoon outlet serves smaller ones. \u00a0I prefer the larger style offered at the Race Course shop.The ambiance is pretty basic. \u00a0There are some art accents on the walls. \u00a0There was a muted television. \u00a0The tables and chairs are very basic and functional. \u00a0They are also packed in. \u00a0If you are a smaller group, you can expect that you will be sitting very close to another group. \u00a0This is not a place for a romantic date or arranging illicit business deals. \u00a0While we were there, they were taking full advantage of all that packed in seating. \u00a0The restaurant was hopping.tinyurl.com/qexq2byThe service is based on efficiency. \u00a0They have a lot of staff on hand. I think the goal is to get your order, bring your food, and get you out the door as quickly as possible. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, the staff is not rude. \u00a0But there are no pleasantries. \u00a0We were quickly seated. \u00a0Our order was taken soon after. \u00a0Right after that, the rice and some condiments were placed on our banana leafs. \u00a0 Before we could say, \"bring us some great Indian food\" the remainder of our meal starting flowing onto our \"almost too small to hold it all\" table.A note: \u00a0There is always a lot made of eating with your hands at Banana Leaf Apolo. \u00a0I did not see anyone eating with their hands at either shop. \u00a0I've actually seen this a lot more at some other Indian restaurants I've visited. \u00a0At both outlets, we were provided with forks and spoons.The food ranged from good to very good. \u00a0One note, none of the food was very hot. \u00a0It was all kind of warm. \u00a0This did slightly detract from my enjoyment of some of the dishes.Dinner Collage:tinyurl.com/pa5hm3uVegetable Samosa - This was a good samosa. \u00a0It ticked off the basic boxes. \u00a0It was crisp on the outside. \u00a0It was tender and flavourful on the inside. \u00a0However, as samosas go, it did not really stand out.tinyurl.com/otaqazrGobi 65 - This is a cauliflower starter. \u00a0It is fried cauliflower with a ginger and chilli sauce. I expected it to have more spicy zip. \u00a0The cauliflower was almost perfectly cooked and their was a nice balance of flavours. This dish would also have been better if it had been hotter. \u00a0When it was brought to the table, it was luke warm. \u00a0I still enjoyed it though.tinyurl.com/ngvc8k2Chilli Fish - First, the fish was perfectly cooked. \u00a0It was tender and flaky. \u00a0The flavour of the fish was very delicate. \u00a0This is another dish that I expected to have more kick to it. \u00a0After all, there is chilli right there in the name. But, it was actually a very mild dish. \u00a0I enjoyed it. \u00a0Out of all the dishes, this is the one that had that just prepared taste to it. I would not hesitate to order it again.tinyurl.com/oskosh3Aloo Gobi Mattar - Aloo Gobi has truly became one of my mainstays of an Indian meal. \u00a0This has only really developed in the last year. \u00a0This was a nice rendition of the dish. \u00a0The cauliflower and potatoes were cooked well. \u00a0They each still had a nice \"bite\" to them. \u00a0The sauce was flavourful. \u00a0The portion was generous. \u00a0This is another dish though that would have benefited from being served a little hotter.tinyurl.com/o5owlasButter Chicken - This was a pretty standard butter chicken. \u00a0It was creamy. \u00a0The chicken was tender. \u00a0It was rich and yes, buttery.tinyurl.com/qjheburReceipt (Dinner for 2): $68.48tinyurl.com/py5yj7mOverall - This was a enjoyable Indian dining experience. \u00a0The ambiance and service are both based on function and efficiency. \u00a0The restaurant has a nice buzz because it is full of people enjoying their tasty Indian food. \u00a0The food had some inconsistencies but overall was well prepared and flavourful. \u00a0They could improve by serving their food at a slightly higher temperature. \u00a0I also wouldn't mind a little more spicy zip, where applicable. \u00a0As with the other Banana Leaf, I am doing a little rounding up to get to the fourth star.",

    "text": "Beforehand you should know: a free table on a weekend day is like winning the lottery, because The Banana Leaf Apolo is often hopelessly crowded and does not really appear romantically charming, as the arrangement of the tables kind of make you feel like visiting a canteen. If you have however managed to get a table, a visit to this restaurant with its northern Indian cuisine is the absolute jackpot. In the back of the restaurant you will find the daily offered displayed in a glass cabinet. It's damn hard to make a decision and you will even receive an additional menu at the table. Heaven help!The restaurant is above all famous for their signature dich: fish head curry, slowly cooked in a curry based spicy sauce. If you are lucky and finally made up your mind, you can order the main dishes at the table. Sides, such as rice and vegetables will be refilled \"automatically\". The waiters will come in regular intervals, carrying large pots with yummy treats asking you, if you would like another serving. Oh happy land of milk and honey!The food literally swept me off my feet. Granted, I have never been a huge fan of Indian cuisine. So accordingly, I did not have high expectations. But: the flavors that my taste buds may experience today, would even exceed the highest expectations. The spicy grilled mutton is provided with a touch of cinnamon. The squid is buttery soft and simply melts in your mouth. I can taste a vast number of different spices that unify to an outstanding taste experience.",

    "text": "This is our go-to place for many years for fish head curry. Generally the food is excellent and service decent. The last visit was not up to the usual standard. We got there early around 1145am before the lunch crowd descended. Maybe we were too early that the kitchen staff forgot what we wanted. Or maybe we rejected whatever the assistant manager recommended and he was unhappy and placed in the wrong order. So our medium size fish head curry came without the garnishes. No pineapple or coriander. It looked woefully plain. Taste was still ok. Then our masala chicken was white meat when we distinctly requested for chicken leg. The assistant manager said we never informed him and went away mumbling to himself to replace the dish. The chicken was tough and not as good as usual. He started plopping vegetables on our plates without saying what they were. When we discovered it was bitter gourd (I do not eat it) and requested for more of the other vegetables, he said no and that we should have told him before he served the bitter gourd. How would we know it was that when he never told us what the vegetable was. Usually the vegetable served was not bitter gourd. And the pappadum was so miserable. I had never seen such a small portion before. Then the assistant manager came back after we were done with our food asking if we wanted more vegetables.It just kinda ruined the whole dining experience.",

The garlic naan had loads of garlic, so the butter naan was perfect in taste. The mango lassi drink was delicious and I could drink gallons of that all day! What was confusing about this visit was when we ordered rice for the table, on one person received a large spoon serving of it on their plate. We, at the table (4 out of 5 of us) were confused or thought it was a joke that only one person received a serving of the rice. After that, we were guessing that maybe he order was per person. Without making another few orders of rice, we just shared from that person's plate which was just enough for all of us. Good Indian food recommended by the internet of top places to eat in Little India in Singapore.",

    "text": "Impressive.Yes, \u00a0Anthony Bourdain's segment brought me here. \u00a0Yes I half expected a tourist trap selling fish head curry but instead found an authentic Indian restaurant packed with locals. \u00a0Bowls filled with spice laden curries and stews and the air, thick with aromatic spices. \u00a0A frenetic energy throughout. Since 1974 Banana Leaf has been dishing out Indian favorites. \u00a0The banana leaf is the \"plate\" and it is not uncommon for guest to dine entirely with their fingers (use your right hand ONLY) though a spoon and fork are provided for those uncomfortable or unable to finger their foods.Chicken Tikka, deeply marinated in kefir lime leaves, mint, cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, cardamom, ginger, and other spices is cooked in the tandoor until fall apart tender yet remaining wildly juicy (try that with a normal chicken breast). \u00a0A side of herbaceous mint chutney only increases the flavor.Spicy, moist chunks of fish are cooked in blend of spices, so generous, the spices alone thicken the \"sauce\". \u00a0The garam masala spice blends flavor is incrredible. \u00a0A splash of fermented fish sauce adds complexity and depth.Need carbs? \u00a0The Apolo Mutton Dum Biryani is outstanding. \u00a0A signature dish, it features deeply flavored, turmeric supercharged basmati rice cooked with cubes of tender, not gamey mutton. \u00a0Yogurt and a fiery fruit based chutney become it's perfect accompaniment.Finally the mops, tandoor roti (layered, denser, whole wheat bread) and naan (fluffy, leavened, toothsome refined flour bread), both cooked in the tandoor near perfect.An incredible mango lassi (more like pure mango puree with yogurt) extinguishes any heat and makes for a satisfying conclusion to the meal.Proud of one's fingering technique and properly full, a meal that leaves you satisfied and oddly ready to return to the sweltering Singaporean heat.",

Things have changed since my last trip here. We now place our orders on the iPad. To be honest I miss the old system although it's more convenient now. I ordered my usual - fish cutlets, apolo chicken biryani set - comes with two veges and I love the masala on this chicken, fish curry and mango lassi. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and sooo satisfying. And let me reiterate what the other reviews said - this is NOT a tourist trap. I've been coming here for years and it's always on my list when I go home. Sure, there are plenty of places that you can eat for under $10 but good food is good food, and there's only one Banana Leaf Apolo.",

    "text": "Banana Leaf Apolo Restaurant, a name synonymous with Indian Cuisine. It's been years since I came to this restaurant and despite stiff competition surrounding it, the restaurant, was absolutely buzzing. Our relatives got there around 6.15pm. Seeing it was empty, they decided to walk around to explore the surrounding restaurants and when we returned at 6.40pm, the restaurant was 70% full. By 7.00pm, the restaurant was packed to capacity and a queue had starting forming. The question is.... Is the food really that good? Or do people only come to banana leaf for the name. Fish Tikka ($19.00)Pretty expensive as far as fish tikkas go. At $19, it's certainly one of if not the most expensive Fish Tikka I've had. The Tadoor seasoning, while coloring the fish beautifully, lacked that aromatic Tandoor spice, while the fish itself was overcooked and dry. Very disappointing. Murgh Malai Kebab ($15.00)The dish was amazing...on the menu.Marinated in yogurt, malai (cream) and cheese, the dish was meant to be succulent, juicy and bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, it was neither. The chicken was dry, tough and neither the yogurt or the spices shone through. It tasted like a very one dimensional dish which never really got the palette excited and I found myself struggling with a single piece, often drowning it with the mint sauce to mask the chalkiness of the chicken. Butter Chicken ($16.00)Average.... Very very average. Chicken pieces was again overcooked and a little dry while the sauce lacked the richness you expect from a butter chicken. While you could still taste the spices used and the sweetness from the onions, it tasted like a watered down version and severely lacked the intensity or boldness that is usually associated with a good butter chicken. Mutton Briyani U fortunately, I can't give a price for this dish or actually highlight which mutton dish it was served with. Mutton Briyani or dum briyani is only served during lunch. When we ordered it for dinner, it came with Briyani rice for everyone and a bowl of what tasted and look like Mutton Masala. However, the braised cabbage and bittergourd it came with was excellent and wonderfully cooked (although the bittergourd isn't for the faint hearted) and the rice was fragrant and fluffy. The mutton.... The mutton had to be one of the best well cooked mutton dishes I've ever had. I'll be honest, the sauce was average, tasty but nothing to shout about but the cook of the mutton was perfect. tender and perfectly braised, the mutton had absorb the flavors of the spices wonderfully. Would have been a much better dish had the sauce had more depth and punch. Fish Head Curry ($38.00 - Large)As compared to the Chinese versions, this is quite a steal, with a WHOLE fish head being served. And it was huge! This had to be the best dish of the night. The curry was light and very fragrant, not overpowering the natural sweetness from the fish while tomatoes and pineapples added a nice sweet / sour twist to the dish. The fish head curry here tasted like an evolution of the 3 common fish head curries we find in Singapore. The curry was smooth and contained a little coconut milk (Chinese), yes was light and slightly tangy although not as strong as the Assam versions (Malay) and had the fragrance and flavors from the spices used (Indian). The head itself had a lot of meat... A LOT. It was perfectly cooked too, moist and flaking off the bones perfectly. A very well executed dish that helped whet the palette. Garlic Naan The dough was very good. There was a tinge of sweetness which complemented the pungent garlic well but, we wished it was serves fresher. By the time it got to us it tasted like it's been left out for a while before serving. Drinks. The Lassi and Mango Lassi here were both very very good. The Teh Tarik felt a little light to me but the Masala tea was excellent Overall the food was average, with exception to the fish head curry, which was the saving grace of the meal. Food needed a bit more care and just that little bit more flavor and the staff could certainly be friendlier too.",

    "text": "This place is somewhat of a tourist trap and there are other banana leaf joints for Indian food in Little India. Overall though, it was not bad.You eat on a banana leaf. They dump some sides on your plate. The fish head curry wasn't as amazing as all the hype was about. Spicy but not enough flavor? Small size was pretty big for two people. Somewhat disappointed.The Masala Prawns were good.The butter chicken was just okay.They have many locations so it's not bad if you want a quick Indian fix.",

    "text": "We had to try this place after reading so much about it. I went with a big group on a weekend. We had reservations, which is a must, as it gets VERY busy. The waiter even told us that they kick people out if they're even 5 minutes late to their reservation...We got the fish curry and biryani. The process of ordering is a little confusing, and I wish our waiter had explained to us how it works. If you order Biryani, the rice comes separately. This is something I've never encountered before, so I was very confused when a bowl of just mutton and sauce arrived. Nonetheless, the biryani was fantastic! Well spiced and the meat was tender. The fish curry was a very generous size and fantastic as well. Lots of tender meat and spicy curry. Overall, the place lives up to its name, however it can get pretty chaotic during busy times.",

However, I feel like the service can be improved... when we sat down to order our food, there were a lot of firm instructions given as to where we can put our bags, that we are not allowed to share our rice portions and we could not keep a menu with us at the table \u00a0because there were not enough, but hardly half of the restaurant was filled! Would appreciate better service next time since we do pay for service charge!",

No disappointments (except for the $2/bottle of water already on the table which I wouldn't have opened had I known). Flavour, service, atmosphere, service and food section were all great, would definitely go back if in little India. Yum and yum.",
