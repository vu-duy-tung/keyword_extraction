After changing jobs, I really miss their Pineapple rice sets that comes with a generous serving of other sides at a total cost of $8.90++.The restaurant serve authentic thai food and it's really a delight to indulge. Another one of my favourite is their tapioca dessert which fortunately did not run out the evening I was there. The tapioca was sweet and warm with a generous amount of coconut milk.With Purvis Street near my current work place, I should be coming back again soon!",

I also noted that their menu had Tissue paper listed as a purchasable item. And no, they don't provide a single napkin with your food. What a ridiculous and cheapskate eatery. Food wise, it was mediocre. Especially the green curry.",

I am quite partial to their green curry rice set which comes with a bowl of rice, a bowl of green curry filled with ingredients, traditional Thai dessert of the day and a cup of drink. If you have a bigger stomach, you can try their pineapple rice set which comes with a plate of pineapple rice and a sample platter of their green curry, one spring roll, one pandan chicken, sweet and spicy fish. It also comes with their dessert of the day and a cup of drink. For the price you pay, I'll say it's worth it. Their pandan chicken well, it's amazing. I love it. It's $2 a piece but hey, it's pretty big. Do give Jai Thai a try if you are around the Purvis Street area!",

    "text": "My other go-to Thai place in Singapore and it is really near my office. I eat here during lunch and always order ala carte. I get that most office folks dig the set lunches which come in these flower shaped platters, but I prefer ordering 3-4 dishes (portions are more than adequate) with friends and it works out to about the same price. Food here is pretty close to what you'd get in Thailand.The fish and prawn cakes here are handmade and fried fresh, just like at Joe's Thai. The tom yam soup is authentic and therefore searingly spicy. Even for someone who comes from a line of chili kings & queens, Jai Thai sometimes gives me a stomach ache afterwards from the spiciness so I usually ask them to tone it down a bit. I also like the steamed tofu with basil chicken, which is a different take on the usual Thai basil chicken. Their prawn tung hoon (which is one of my barometers of a good Thai cook, along with beef soup and fried duck) is darn good too. Basically, I haven't found any dish that wasn't to my liking. Prices are ridiculously cheap but don't tell the restaurant that. Service is hit or miss and if you reach there any later than 12.30pm on a weekday and aren't willing to share a table, go look somewhere else because this place is always packed.",

My friends had good reviews about the place, saying the food there was good and cheap so I agreed to give it a try. I ordered the Phad Thai since it is a Thai dish that can determine the standard of a good Thai restaurant. The dish was so fragrant that I could smell it the moment they brought it out of the kitchen. To my surprise, the Phad Thai was flavorful and fulfilling. The dash of lime balanced the sweetness of the dish and made it perfect. Also, it was not dry like how most Thai restaurants do it, so it was really palatable. The prawns were fresh, crunchy and succulent, while the little bits of egg were really tasty. The service was good, as the staff was warm and hospitable. I would probably go back again whenever I need a quick fix for a Thai food craving.",
