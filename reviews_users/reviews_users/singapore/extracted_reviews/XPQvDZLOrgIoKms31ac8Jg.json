    "text": "I was drawn by the long queue every time I pass by the row of shophouses near Bugis Village and finally got to join the queue one day. They have a robust system with the assigning of tables. They will ask each person in the queue how many people they are expecting and they will only ask each group to go in when everyone in the group reaches. Usually the first seats that become available are at the counter but if you prefer to wait for a table, that's fine. Waiting outside the restaurant can be hot and it's annoying if people sit and smoke but the restaurant is considerate in offering free flow of ice tea for people in the queue. Trivial point but I was surprised that the restaurant played the same Japanese song throughout the night. I thought it's because of the speaker outside the restaurant but when I went in, the same song still played. Service was great and the waitress had a sense of humour when we came up with weird names for the order sheets. Food was good with every item meeting expectations. My friend could not finish her portion but it might just be because she's a small eater. Seating space can be a bit cramped and stuffy but we still sat for 1 hour plus. If you are here for the food, perhaps wait until off-peak hours like after 8:30am to skip the queue!",

    "text": "Very disappointed. == Food ==They have an ordering sheet where you have some level of customisation on your ramen. Whether you want to add seaweed, eggs, noodles texture, soup taste, etc. We ordered a Summer (Spicy Pork) and an Autumn ramen. They were super speedy. We probably received our noodles in like less than 2mins. Drinks came in probably less than 30secs.The noodles were a major disappointment. The soup was very salty, the pork was a mega piece that was hard to tear and did not taste fresh.They had complementary bean sprout and hard boiled egg for dine in customers. A little fancy small bowl with sesame seeds that you can pound on your own. We only made it slightly close to half of the bowl. Just felt it wasn't worth eating anymore. == Ambience & Service ==The external decoration was really nice and they had newspaper clippings of being featured. In addition, I came across quite a number of their restaurant before so I figured it was fine giving it a shot.The staff were all dressed up well, and tries to be very prompt. Just a tad intrusive.The interior decor was really fancy too. I would say good attempt on the decor that create the Japanese environment/mood.",

That was awkward. I guess people in Singapore keep their looks pretty bland, but I am getting tired of all the gawking. I got the summer ramen. The broth was pretty spicy and creamy and overall it was aight. The spiciness covered most other flavors that might've been there rather than enhancing. On the order sheet I marked no black fungus, but got it anyway. The waiters are brusque and loud. I couldn't understand most of what they were yelling at me. I did appreciate the quick service. You pay up front with the order sheet they hand to you. This place was ok, but with just ramen on the menu and an unimpressive first visit, it's unlikely that I'll be back.",

So it can be a good deal or average deal depending on how you choose. I doubt you can have this business model in other countries where people would stuff their pockets with boiled eggs. Actually you can order a flavored egg for extra or take the free one? I think normally other places just put it in for free with a higher base price. Ok I'm bored talking about it. You know the green tea cola doesn't taste like green tea. Actually I tasted something like this before but I can't remember where. It's nice but not green tea flavored like I expected. There is \"green tea\" in the ingredients though.",

So far I think this Tonkotsu King chain shop is the best compare to other branches.I just love everything about this ramen shop, here's why:Free flow eggs! I always eat at least 5 eggs there...The rich broth!The fact that everything is optional, you get to choose what you want or don't want to be in your ramen, hence making it possible to pay a cheaper price and I like my ramen to be basic anyway.I always go for Winter Ramen which is the simplest yet most satisfying for me. It's so authentic and delicious. It kinda reminds me a little bit of Ichiran Ramen in Japan. The meat is the perfect cut for ramen, it is so tender, thick and juicy too. Such an impressive combo and hopefully they'll keep up their standard for the crowds. Oh, don't forget to order some rice dishes if you're still hungry after that bowl of ramen because they taste great as well! Or if you're feeling thrifty just order white rice and throw it in the broth, plain tasty!",

I just seem to like soupy noodles. And on that note, here we go.Free bean sprouts. Free boiled egg. That's a pretty good start in my books! Very modest menu with 4 versions of ramen served, 'Spring' is with basil and cheese, 'Summer' is spicy pork minced, 'autumn' is pork minced with bonito flavour & fried mixed mushrooms, and 'winter' is the humble pork broth ramen. I went with humble. Lovely soup base. But Im not hard to please. I did find the portion of ramen noodles quite small. They have the option, if you're still hungry afterwards, to order 'kaedama' which is the ordering of extra noodles for $2. But the very cynical side of me says the original portion is smaller, so that you end up ordering kaedama. Or that's the conspiracist in me thinking out loud. Other than that small blemish, the experience is a delight. Ramen noodles is a pretty quick affair. You slurp, and then move on. This establishment doesn't complicate things with unnecessary menu items. So if you just want your noodles, give this a try.",

This is also their 4th outlet here.There's free boiled eggs and beansprouts. The marinated beansprouts tasted awesome and refreshing!I had a Tonkotsu Ramen Winter with All Toppings. This was basically the normal tonkotsu ramen, one should have in the winter season. The all toppings added jew's ear, seaweed, soft-boiled egg and stir-fried pork into the ramen. The broth was thick and not at all salty, the ramen tasted chewy. The seaweed came in a big piece, something which I didn't really expect. The soft-boiled egg was cooked perfectly, silky and full of flavour. The stir-fried pork was excellent too, chewy and flavourful.My friend had a Tonkotsu Ramen Autumn with All Toppings. Autumn is minced pork with bonitos flavour with fried mixed mushroom. The minced pork tasted great alongside with the mixed mushroom. Otherwise, the same taste for Winter applies here.A definitely must come to place for a ramen lover. It is no wonder that this place is in the tops for best ramen in Singapore, though in comparisons to other ramens I have eaten this place will definitely be in the lead, making the 40 minutes that I have waited in the queue just to get seated worthwhile. Do get the Green Tea Cola while you are here!",

It was a nice change from the usual straight Tonkotsu King options, but still back up by their super rich broth. Let's be honest here.ANYTHING with that broth will be good. It's so rich that it should be TAXABLE. It's that good!And basically, put any (reasonable) combination of flavour enhancers like pork, mushroom, spicy miso, bonito, ANYTHING with noodles and douse it in that soup base? It'll be good.Why is the service worth docking a star for though?DECEIT. I was quite happy to notice that this branch accepts credit cards. They have stickers and signs, and in particular, my primary daily use card is an AMEX card. There's a BIG sticker saying Amex accepted here. The pen next to the cashier is an Amex pen. WELL GUESS WHAT. They don't accept Amex. W. T. F. Then take down that sticker and throw away that pen because I accept that not every stall accepts Amex, but don't mislead me into not going to the ATM before I dine at your restaurant just because you want to PRETEND that you accept Amex.So. The ramen? Still awesome. Still worth the visit.But man, this whole credit card thing just left such a bad taste in my mouth.",

Tonkotsu suits my preference in the heavy rich soup they serve as its akin to Jangara ramen in Tokyo which still stands as my number one choice in Japan. Its quite creamy and not everyone's taste, but each season on the menu has a different broth to cater for differing palates. I can't comment on the other choices for now, but it suffices to say that the Tonkotsu King special is excellent. The menu option also allows one to adjust the broth's taste and the noodle hardness. If you want it like the Japanese then I recommend the hard noodles.Kaidama is the genius option of having another serving of noodles 'as is' which you can put straight into the soup you had served first. The noodle servings are rather miserly so this is a good option for the hungry at little extra cost.Pickled bean sprouts and boiled eggs are complimentary. The prices are somewhat higher than they would be in Japan but I am still a wiling buyer.",
