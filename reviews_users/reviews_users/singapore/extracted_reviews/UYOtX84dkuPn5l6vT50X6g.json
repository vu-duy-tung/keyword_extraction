My friend convinced me to share the churros and those were just plain bad: they tasted like stale oil and the consistency was wrong.I do understand the appeal and why other people like this place: it has a nice atmosphere, the staff is friendly and it offers Mexican food. If i would live nearby I might come again and try their burritos to see if they are any better but since there are much better Mexican options nearer to my house, so I am going to give this a pass next time I am in Katong.",

    "text": "One Yelper put it best, \"About as Mexican as me.\" This is not an authentic Mexican restaurant, but this is not to say you should avoid this place entirely. The food for me is three-stars (good enough for late night hangovers and to satisfy my once-in-a-while Mexican food cravings). My go to dishes are the following:(i) Chipotle Beef Burrito - sweet corn & pineapple salsa, cilantro rice, homemade guacamole, jalapenos(ii) Cumin and Grilled Chicken Burrito - Bacon & Pinto beans, cilantro & lime rice, sour cream.Although the food can be much more authentic, the atmosphere and dining experience of Lower East Side is five stars. Foreigners living in the area absolutely love this place! For one, they play top 40 hits (no local coverbands, thank goodness), which makes the dining experience fun and, in some sense, clubby. \u00a0Second, its just a really relaxed atmosphere with solid service. Best of all, this place is open til midnight on the weekends and 11pm Monday - Friday. In short, this probably the only game in town, if you are looking for late night food on East Coast Road. Let's face it, Mexican food in Singapore is ridiculously bad, or ridiculously expensive (Lucha Loco and Super Loco exemplify both). If I were to rank this restaurant in the US, this would be two stars, but among Singapore's limited Mexican options, this is four stars.",

True, maybe the flavours aren't traditional, but I happen to like them.I've tried the beef burrito and the chicken burrito, and my stomach forever loves the chicken. The aioli sauce on the side makes it even better! However, I'm not too much a fan of their elotes. For me, Super Loco in Robertson Quay actually wins that battle.The decor is really neat here. It exudes Mexican realness and the various chairs hanging from the ceiling makes it a great conversation starter. The vibe is very chill and there's always a good playlist on. Alcohol can be expensive; it might be best to come before 8 PM to take advantage of their 1-for-1 deal.Best part about this place? The kitchen is open 'til 2 AM. There's not a lot of places on this part of East Coast Road that are open that late, so it definitely helps if you need late night nosh!",

They seem to have supply chain issues, as many of the items we wanted to order, chicken, pork or guacamole were \"not ready\". \u00a0We both ordered beef \u00a0burritos. They were $13 and one of the halves only had 1 piece of beef and a whole lot of rice. We felt robbed. It's really a shame. The decor was great and the concept is cool, but the food was so underwhelming. I would much rather go to se\u00f1or taco or Lucha loco!",

    "text": "Nice decor, ok food, crap service. This is one of the newest Mexican places in town, and being in the 'hood warranted a visit. We got the elotes, hake taco trio, les mix and a bucket of corona. Now my gold standard of elotes is the one dished up at Mamasita in Melbourne. It's not even that difficult to recreate it, which I've done. The corn here is char grilled, which is good, but waaaaay drier than the mayo slathered monstrosities I love. I loved the guac, and the other items were ok, if a bit complicated, with nice plating and all. It's alright I suppose, but Mexican nosh to me is fun and street-foody so I'm not a fan of the frills and pretty layering. Service though, is terrible. There were two waitresses to a half empty restaurant, and one of which had no idea there was a happy hour promo as indicated on the menu. The other, who knew about it, explained that buying 5 beers would get you 1 free. And since majority of the beers were $15 a pop, I asked if I could mix 5 $15 bottles then. Alas no, and no justification given. Quite silly, really. Our appetisers came in with no cutlery. And after being tired of waiting for service, I went to pick up the serviettes and forks and knives myself- only to have the waitress tell me I have those items on my table. I must have looked rather dumbfounded at that, because it embarrassed her enough to carry the stuff off my hands to my table where my first batch of invisible cutlery was. And when I asked for the bill, I was dismissed with 'wait, wait' as the waitress sailed on by. She later asked me how the food was, to which I replied the corn was a little dry. 'Oh'. That's it. Brings to mind the comic of a shredder located underneath a suggestion box.The place is new, I geddit. And all places have their teething pains, I geddit too. But still, the F&B industry here is cutthroat and I'm going to take my business to somewhere less stuffy and with better staff instead.",

The corn salsa was tasty but there was something off about the steak.Shared a basket of guac and chips - it's alright. The guacamole is more the creamy kind than the gritty textured kind that i love.I would still come back here for the tilapia tacos though! They looked amazing.",

I had chicken chilaquillas (nachos), their specialty ribs, a side of cilantro rice and sour cream, and a chocolate tart for dessert. The chilaquillas were excellent. Smothered with cheese and sauce unlike most other restaurants around here. The ribs were good. The blend of spices in the sauce was unique, but pleasant. I was expecting the dessert of the day to be something tiny given that the full set including free flow ice tea only costs $12++, but I was surprised by both the size and quality of the tart. I've paid $12 (maybe more) for similar desserts at other restaurants. I must say, this was $12 extremely well spent :-)",
