The sauce that went along with it was super delicious. The rice with duck sauce also made it very tasty to eat. This place is definitely one of the best places to come for duck and duck rice.",

We paid $80/kg at Long Beach Seafood so it's \u00a0not an outrageous price to pay for a big Sri Lankan crab. No, you won't get white glove service. If you're reading this, you probably have already seen th Anthony Bourdain episode, so why the fuk would you expect Michelin star service?? Yelp is full of fukkin people who expect great service everywhere when is really the food that should matter. It's two little old ladies who are the waiters, you really expect them to change out your silverware after every dish? Jeezus, get over yourselves. Anyway, the food here is good. The crab is fresh and sweet and the veggies are probably the best I've ever had. Get the gong gong and then save the sauce to dip the crab in.",

    "text": "This is the famously infamous (or infamously famous) place that foodies will know of. I am humbled to only know about this place the day I visited it a fortnight ago. On that day, I've heard stories (almost like tales and legends) about this place from my cousin who brought me there. After having the experience of eating there, I've been waiting and thinking about what to write of this place because it just brings in so many mixed emotions. I shall just write the whole process of it here.Emotion 1: NegativityWhen you eat here for the first time, you'd better know you are paying big bucks here. However the environment and place will smash all your expectations into pieces because of how run-down it seems. The toilet is horrendous (you can't even lock the door). Paying big bucks for a lousy place = doesn't seem like a good deal.Other than the place, if your order taker is the chef himself, get ready for bad attitude or nonchalant at best. Read of it more on the other yelpers' reviews. Emotion 2: Gradual acceptanceWhen the wave of food comes, the person who brought you there will rave all about it. You may come to gradually accept that it is good, but not all that good and worth it though for what they (or rather, he) charges you.Emotion 3: Euphoria Dish after dish came out. Every dish served was nice, unique in its own way. There are only 8 special dishes you should try. It's on the bill I attached on one of the photos. And to cut to the chase, I missed the last dish cause I was too full. I missed the crab bee hoon. YES I MISSED IT. You can't believe I came to this restaurant and missed the most famous dish of theirs. I was too full I couldn't stomach any more stuff no matter what delicacy from heaven it is. So we decided to pack some of it home for me to try. The look of disappointment on everyone's face that I didn't get to try it was immense. They all said \"it wouldn't taste as good when you bring home\". The next night I was hungry at 9pm, took the crab bee hoon and microwaved it. When I tried the bee hoon with the crab and sauce and everything, I almost fainted. IT WAS DAMN BLOODY GOOD! I almost dropped my bowl, I almost couldn't stop myself from shouting out \"yes yes yes!\" There is nothing close to this anywhere. It's like bun-jee jumping. Try it if you dare. The experience is gonna be unforgettable.",

    "text": "This review brings up mixed emotions in me. On one hand, this place's food made it to my top three eats while visiting Singapore. On the other hand, everything else but the food made it kinda negative. The only consolation I have is that I went in with my eyes open, because this is a highly infamous and famous restaurant. Infamous - because the owner Danny has been called a \"Food Nazi\", and behaved like one! The stories I read about him made it sound like an urban legend - there are no menus, you order what he tells you to have, you sit down patiently for over an hour and don't ask for him to hurry up, the place is located in Singapore's red-light district area in a shophouse that is dishelved and probably unrenovated for the past forty years; and the price is an exorbitant $80 USD minimum per person for seafood dishes. I caught myself thinking - why would people come back to receive such abuse and pay so much? Either the food is really THAT good, or they are all suckers. But Anthony Bourdain listed this place as one of this \"13 Places to Eat before you Die\" (menshealth.com/nutrition\u2026), so how bad could it be?My experience was no different from all that I've read. Yep, Danny was unfriendly and curt, we had no menus, and luckily I went with a friend and his girlfriend whose Dad knew him, so I think I only got a fraction of the attitude that he usually doles out to other clients. Of course, we had to have the \"Crab Bee Hoon\", or vermicelli noodles cooked with a whole crab and served with soup. He tailors the portions so we don't have a choice of what size of dish to order. Yep, it's not up to us, hence his nickname. We also ordered the black pepper scallop that Danny told us to order. Results: the food was spectacularly tasty. Unbelievable. The soup broth was indescribable, a mixture of different spices and a perfect complement to the texture of the noodles. The scallops were to die for too. Of course, our food took about 1.5 hours to prepare, no explanations, but the place was packed for a Wednesday evening so we figured it was because he was the only chef and you just had to wait your turn. The bill was in my expected range, since I had already been forewarned by my friend. So I am glad that I didn't get a massive heart attack - the bill for the 3 of us came up to about 200 USD! This was a dingy coffeeshop in a seedy area that could have passed off as a hole in the wall joint. Even with the fresh seafood provided, since there are no other cooks and only one other server, there really is no explanation for the exorbitant price, other than contribution to his profit. That said, the food tasted superb, and when I chatted with another table of tourists sitting across us, they also knew the price range and so it seems like everyone who comes here knows what they are getting into. Regardless, despite the awesome taste of the food, I can't give anything better than 2 stars because of the chef's attitude and callousness to customers; and the crazy prices we paid. The local news had also covered this issue about pricing - you can be the judge for yourself by referring to this article that was published a few years ago (sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/\u2026)All said, I am glad that I tried this place, and I am happier that I went in with a full knowledge of what to expect. But I won't be back, there are just many other places where I can spend good money to get great food. I pity the tourist who shows up at Sin Huat without clear expectations about what he or she is getting into!",

IN THE WORLD LEH. This is a very huge prestige okay.The chef, known as Danny, is a guy you don't want to mess with. He is proud of his crabs and you'd better order crabs when you're there. Specifically their signature crab vermicelli. There are no menus no nothing, and don't expect their staff to entertain you with a Q&A session on item and prices - if you're brave enough to visit Sin Huat, you're there to splurge. Be prepared to pay at least a few hundreds, and yes, it makes more economical sense to visit it as a group.If you like your crab mixed with gravy and vermicelli, you'd devour this piping-hot rich and savoury dish Sin Huat puts on your table.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews.",

The sauce was so garlicy and good. And talk about garlic....the prawns were raised in an ocean of garlic then they beat them to death with cloves of garlic then they cooked them with even more garlic. \u00a0My hands stunk for days, but it was worth it. \u00a0The sea snails have this spicy sauce that I seriously almost took it home to save it for later. \u00a0You wont go here every day or month but just go here at least once to try it out.",
