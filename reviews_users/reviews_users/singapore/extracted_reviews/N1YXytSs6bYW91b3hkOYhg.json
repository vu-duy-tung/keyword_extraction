    "text": "The chicken meat was beautifully grilled where the outer skin had a nice charred taste and the meat inside was still moist and tasty. Depending on your order, they will have a special sauce glaze over their meat. With my colleague, we both ordered a whole chicken and 3 sides:3 Beans Salad - tangy dressing over 3 types of beans, the red kidney beans, chickpeas and yellow beans. I also like the slices of onions and capsicum thrown in. Coleslaw - rich and creamy and slightly tangy, the vegetables used were also fresh. Grilled Vegetables - sliced vegetables that had that nicely grilled taste. A great side dish that is light and tasty.Service, while friendly, is a tad slow. The food also takes a while to arrive so may not good to eat here if you're in a rush.",

I was seated quickly but no one came by to take my order. I waited for more than 25 mins and servers looked at me and walked away. I gave up and left and no one asked me for how my meal was. The poor service is absolutely a game changer for me. In Singapore one is made to pay for service charge whether or not service was good or bad. Don't eat here if you can avoid it.",

We waited 25 minutes for a simple order of wedges, and had to ask the servers 3 times to check on them before finally getting a half-assed acknowledgement. When we went to pay, we needed change for a 50 sgd bill. The server rolled her eyes as she reluctantly snatched the bill from my hand, allowing us to finally pay and escape this abomination of a Nandos.",

    "text": "I've been back a few times now to this location and the service has been consistently poor, slow, and neglectful, even with an empty dining room. They are always understaffed, with for instance one cook and one host who moves back and forth between recruiting outside and (barely) waiting tables inside. Meanwhile, it seems two or three people are always hiding behind the register doing nothing. I don't even bother ordering the famous free flow lemon tea here, since it is extremely difficult to get it refilled even once. Don't bother waiting for your bill as you're unlikely to receive it. Just proceed directly to the register and pay there. If fortunate, you will see your server twice (order and initial receipt of food) without hunting someone down. I highly recommend the Nando's in Malaysia, as they have had great service and food. This location simply doesn't live up to the Nando's name and gives a bad impression of the franchise.",

Had to ask for replacements, but then again, burnt food shouldn't even leave the kitchen. 2) Servers were slow, and seem quite haphazard. Doesn't give a sense like they know what each of them are supposed to be doing or suppose to cover. 3) Portions for chicken don't seem to be equal among all plates of the same order. Other than that, it's good tasting chicken. Nothing more.",

Like, super good, I'm not sure if they sprinkled stuff on top but it was really yummy. I think I may have liked it more than the chicken, which was great too.So next, I really did enjoy the extra hot platter - the chicken was far better than I thought it would be. Really flavourful and the skin was crispy in just the way I liked it. You get two sides with the platter, although we had 3. The previously mentioned yummy wedges was one of them. We also had some spinach. I enjoyed it, although it was a tad sour and probably had more spicy sauce mixed inside. As the previous reviewer has mentioned, service was pretty appalling from the start to the end... and it wasn't even super crowded! No communication from the staff (we didn't even know they were seating us because the staff just walked past without a word, expecting us to magically understand we were to follow), they forgot to get our water after saying they would, couldn't settle the bill when we wanted to = wasting our time... it's as bad as it could get for inattentiveness. I shudder to think what it would be like on a busy day!",

But that is about it.I had the Extra Hot Full Platter for 3 with Wedges, Spinach, Corn on the Cob and Spicy Rice as the sides. I can't complain about the chicken as it wasn't dried out and seasoned well. Wedges were awesome with the sauces; Spinach was too much like preserved veggies for my liking; Corn was meh and; Spicy Rice isn't even worth mentioning.Service was pretty mediocre as they were never attentive and all crowded around the kitchen area. This kind of got on my nerves after requiring their attention for 4 times and having to wait a long while for each. Good thing the chicken is awesome enough to turn things around for me.",

It isn't that the food is bad or the servers inept, it is just that Nando's falls solidly within the 'average to \u00a0barely-above-average' chain restaurant. If I was the owner, I might give the staff some extra training in customer service, because we had a problem with our bill once and they seemed skeptical, and I felt as if I had to prove to several staff members that the mistake was on their end.

Very slow - not because they were understaffed but because the staff didn't seem to take the initiative to serve tables. They were either chatting away or standing listlessly outside the restaurant, without being attentive to the diners. I had to call out for service several times. What was even more aggravating was that when we finally got a waitress' attention to take our order, she came by, then told us to wait for \"a while\", and then quickly disappeared. She then resumed her place outside the restaurant and we were again left hanging, waiting to order. What's up with that? It took maybe 5-7 minutes before we got the attention of another waitress to take our order.This outlet suffers from badly trained and disinterested staff. \u00a0I also don't agree with the prices.",
