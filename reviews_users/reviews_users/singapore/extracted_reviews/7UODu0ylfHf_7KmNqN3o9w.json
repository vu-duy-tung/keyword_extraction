We happened to park at Nando's level so in we went.Kid's Set Meal - I must commend their efforts to have a engaging children's menu where the little ones can exercise some choice over their set meal. So my girls got busy trying to make up their own meal.Mushroom Chicken Soup - the soup is very flavourful as it not only has the essence of mushrooms but also the extra boost of chicken soup. My girls were fighting to drink it!Naan with Hummus - hubby likes this. I'm not a fan.Grilled Quarter Chicken - with was well-marinated and good to be eaten without extra sauce. I had mine with Merttertainern Rice and Coleslaw. Both sides were pretty good.We will definitely return again. :)",

    "text": "Located \u00a0on the 4th floor of Plaza Singapura with 11 stores islandwide, Nando's is here, serving up Halal Grilled chicken choices along with a variety of sauces, like the 100 over year old Peri Peri sauce.The dining area is pretty huge and great for large groups. Nando's also serves up a variety of family friendly food and desserts, so there's something for everyone.I'm invited to Nando's today to try out their new Mango & Lime flavour. In the history of Nando's, this is the first time a new flavour has been introduced. So let's see what makes it so special!There's a platter for 4, which you can share the Mango & Lime chicken goodness with your friends and family.There's also a burger or even a Espetada, dangling for all to see and devour!Mango & Lime Full Platter $44.90++Straight to business, we started off with the Mango & Lime Grilled Chicken Platter. Mango & Lime sauce is touted to be between the lemon & herb and mild flavoured sauces, so it's the last stage of sauce before you get to the spicier Peri Peri! I was expecting some spiciness here but there was none. If anything, I felt that the lemon & herb had a stronger kick of spiciness! This Mango & Lime flavour is definitely child-friendly!The flavour of the mango & lime had a more distinctive mango than lime taste. There was a lingering mango aroma from each bite. The chicken as always at Nandos, was tender fresh and overflowing with juicy goodness but without the oil!Served with a choice of sides, we picked garlic bread and wedges. The garlic was so good! Evenly buttered and grilled to perfection! The wedges were crisp and well-seasoned.2. Tropical Fruitea $4.90++A tropical medley of mango and lime, infused with orange juice and iced lemon tea. This was a very refreshing drink though it got a bit concentrated at the bottom of the glass.3. Grilled Chicken Cataplana $18.90++Served in an authentic cooper dish with Peri-Peri chicken thighs, grilled seasonal vegetables, spicey rice and cataplana sauce. This is pretty much a portuguese chicken rice that is very colourful and flavourful. The chicken thigh pieces tasted slightly dry but the rice was very tasty and moist. The rice texture was almost towards the mushy side, but still palatable for me. The charred vegetables were the highlight of this dish!Mushrooms, carrots, capsicum and more! I pierced each slice of vegetable with my fork and I thoroughly enjoyed them. This dish was served with the Mild sauce and this is the spiciest level that I can tahan. Any higher, and it would be a torture for me.4. Mango & Lime Espetada $19.90++ (1 side) / $21.90++ (2 sides)Skewered tender marinated chicken thighs and fresh peppers with a Mango & Lime twist. Beautifully presented. The chicken was flavourful with a tinge of spiciness. If you are having difficulty picking a side, choose the Corn-on-the-Cob! It is buttered so generously, it is overflowing with juices as you nibble onto the corn! It's so good! I would actually come back to Nando's for this. 5. Peri-Peri Soup $5.90++ add $2 for chickenVery authentic and legit mushroom soup with visible mushroom pieces and they are extremely generous with the chicken. You definitely get your $2 worth! The bread here is the same garlic bread you get as a side and it goes excellently with the soup!6. Chicken Livers & Portuguese Roll $5.90++The menu description writes\"You haven't lived until you've tried these. On your own or for 2 people to share.\"Eh, I'm not a fan of pork liver and I probably am also not a fan of chicken liver. I'll just leave it as that, however my dining partners did enjoy this quite a bit.7. Tangy Lemon Tart $5.90++On top of just really awesome Chicken, Nando's also serves desserts such as Tangy Lemon Tart, bottomless froyo and even rainbow cakes! This tangy lemon tart is quite a pretty one, and decent sized enough to be shared. There's a subtle and pleasant sweetness naturally sweetened with honey \u00a0and lemon that will guarantee satisfaction to the sweet tooth!8. Pear-fect Tart $5.90++My favourite dessert of the night, this pear-fect tart is served with sliced of pear between a caramelized layer. The tart layer has a nice level of sweetness and doesn't get too overpowering. The flavour of the pear could be tasted in every mouthful.9. Natas $1.90++ (Portuguese custard tart)The danish-like pie crust was slightly flaky and crisp, a great texture with a distinct buttery fragrance. The custard was good, but not fantastic. A good choice of a sweet ending to a heavy meal at Nando's.Overall : Nando's is one of those restaurants I've seen over the years that doesn't change it's menu too often, but when they do, it's a subtle and yet impactful improvement. This mango & lime flavour gives us non-spicy eaters another flavour to choose from, other than just plain and lemon & herb. The chicken will never fail to meet your expectation of juicy and succulent meats.",

    "text": "I have passed Nando's quite frequently during my time in Singapore and have always made it my goal to make sure I eat here at least once before I depart given all the rave reviews about their chicken.I've finally ventured out and am definitely glad it was on my list. I arrived around 8pm on a Saturday night to stand on a relatively short queue with visibly plenty of tables available, yet still had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated as the attention to service and seating individuals was quite terrible.After eventually receiving a table, and attempting to flag down a waitress for a while, I settled on the 1/4 peri peri bone chicken with hot sauce and 2 sides- spicy rice and coleslaw.The chicken was incredible. They don't necessarily douse your meal in the sauce, but luckily there is a side table with plenty of bottles of all the flavored sauces available. I decided to up it a notch and go for the extra hot and found minimal difference between hot and extra hot- both were relatively tangy to me but still delicious. The spicy rice was pretty moist with a nice spicy kick, and the coleslaw was a little too soaked in mayo for my enjoyment-- I'd likely try another side next time.In all, pleased with the food despite the steep price for the serving, but the service could drastically improve.",

    "text": "I first heard about Nando's from an online friend from UK who's a fan of this franchise. She kept asking me if I have ever tried those \"Peri Peri\" chickens in the Singapore outlets. Unfortunately at that point of time, Nando's was still not Halal-certified here. Odd that the UK's one she frequented was already Halal.Anyways, I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of Portuguese food. But I still decided to give this one a try... Have to say, they're still not convincing to me. Haha!But I really do need to compliment on the variety of the food. Liked that we can choose the level of spiciness of the chickens. I chose chicken wraps. My colleague who's a spicy-freak ordered 'Extra Hot' for her chickens with two servings of spicy rice as both her sides. *shakes head*What really amazed me was the shelf that held all the different sauces. We chose the Extra Hot and Wild Herb sauces. They all had that tangy taste to me... I don't know. At some point of my meal, I'd really wished they whipped up a bottle of Maggie Chili sauce for me.",

    "text": "I love Nando's!I used to eat a lot of Nando's in Melbourne. Every Nando's branch is allllllways packed. It's a really popular restaurant in Australia. When I came to Singapore, I was surprised that they have Nando's here too. But the ones here are kinda.. Dead-ish. I thought why aren't there a lot of people? Maybe only the ones I've seen but it's just not as packed as in Melbs. I decided to give it a try.So I only ordered mild 3 chicken wings on the \"Appateasers\" section. I thought it was good! I was really liking the flavor. But what was it Melbourne that was better? I think it was the chicken. \u00a0Oh, the service here was fine. The staffs were attentive, as there were very little people. But the waiter who was asking my order had to ask me 3 times whether it was 3 chicken wings that I wanted or not. After he had taken my order, he was just walking back and forth because he had nothing to do. Shortly after that the other staffs were talking so loudly to each other right Infront of me while I was enjoying my lunch. It was a bit distracting.",

    "text": "I have fond memories of Nando's when living in Canada as I would have the chicken over rice or chicken pita a few times a month. Unfortunately as with many franchises hitting Singapore's fair shores, not many can actually replicate the exact taste of the food. Nando's is in the hit and miss category. The quarter chicken was very nicely grilled in the rotisserie, with pretty tender meat. At least it was not dried out but I would not say it was juicy and succulent. The sides were a huge disappointment. I asked about the difference between the Mediterranean and spicy rice. The server was not able to tell me much and when I asked which would she recommended, she suggested the Mediterranean rice. I went with that. It turned out to be just rice with corns and peas, looked like those from the frozen package. Wrong choice. I also ordered the spinach which was described as afro-portuguese style with tomatoes and onions. It turned out to be very oily and tasteless. With such not so appetizing sides, I decided to add an order of wedges, only to be told it was not available. I had the fries instead and that turned out to be the nicest item on the menu. It was warm and crispy when it arrived at my table. The service was rather hit and miss too. Some servers were more attentive and others were just standing there, looking at anything and everything except the diners. Will I be back? Most likely not, unless there was no other option. The food and service were not that outstanding enough to grant a frequent repeat visit. Oh and if you want the various peri-peri sauces, you gotta get it yourself.",

    "text": "I remember hearing about this place from the colleagues at my old job. They kept raving about this Portuguese chicken place and I was all, \"What is this special European style bird that you speak of?\" Finally, after Miguel and I were racking our brains to find an easily accessible place for weeknight dinners, I suggested visiting the fabled Nando's in Plaza Sing. We gave it a try and the rest is history! Sometimes the queue can be a bit ridiculous around 7:30 but again, exercise some patience and you're usually seated in 20 minutes or less. Also, the space is bigger than you think; there are more tables behind the drinks area!We're a simple couple so we both order the 1/4 peri-peri chicken with the mild sauce and 2 sides. The mild sauce has a very small kick to it, but it's quite bearable. What's great about Nando's is that they have all the different sauces in bottles that are accessible to everyone, so you can definitely drown your chicken in more sauce if you'd like. I actually recommend this, as I find the chicken a tad bit dry.Miguel has a crazy metabolism and orders 2 sides of rice, while I usually order corn on the cob and one side of rice. The service is pretty quick, not super friendly but better than most. Price wise, it's very affordable so both of us are happy campers. Overall, it's a great casual spot for those who are looking for other Western style food besides the typical American or Italian.",

It's drenched in this secret concoction known as peri-peri sauce and depending on the spice level, has a sort of kick I can only describe as a \"mouth watering delectable sensation\". I find it a bit pricey for what it is and when it's busy, the staff looks a bit flustered and dining in can take FOREVER... like seriously, ETERNITY. I've noticed this at about three locations. One more thing, I asked for ice water and the waitstaff looked at me puzzled, initially. He then came back and said they didn't offer ice water... \u00a0Soooo 4 stars for the food and the 3 stars for service. Anyways, if you have hours to kill then come and enjoy the food.",
