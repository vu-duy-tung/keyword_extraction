    "text": "After my previous visit to Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King Four Seasons , I found myself craving for their ramen again. This time round I went to the one situated at 100AM, which specialised in their chicken broth ramen. The Green Tea Cola tasted a bit like Sprite. It's refreshing to drink this especially after finishing the ramen.The Tori King Ramen with All Toppings is their signature ramen that comes with a chicken thigh, 2 half-boiled egg, a big piece of chashu and a big piece of seaweed. The chicken is tender, the egg tasted invigorating and the chashu was chewy. The greatest credit goes to the soup. It is flavourful, not too salty and accompanies well with the nice-cooked ramen (I didn't finish the soup as per what I did at Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King Four Seasons though).The Black Spicy Tori King Ramen with All Toppings is the black pepper variant of the original ramen. It is nearly the same as the Tori King Ramen except with a little spice. If you do want your ramen to be slightly spicy, this should definitely be ordered.Don't forget to have your ramen with the marinated beansprouts!Definitely will come back here again if I'm craving for ramen. If you are around the Tanjong Pagar area, this is one place to visit (the other being Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King, under the same company)",

I thought I'd met my match at Tonkatsu King, but then they go and whip out a chicken version and my words escape me. The noodles, the tender, tender chicken, the rich green spicy broth, the \"make your own ramen\" slips... it's just, I just, I can't, I mean... no words. In summary, it's worth the wait. Heck, it might even be worth the commute from Sydney.",

The soup base is not too overpowering. The meat is very tender and juicy. Customers get to choose the Level of spiciness of the soup base. But do beware that the spiciness may blow your head out for those who cant really take spicy food.It is a very good ramen stall and I have been to the shop a few times since my first visit last year. It is really worth the wait and the price is reasonable for the quality of food here.",

    "text": "I came here late December on a Monday night with my best friend in Singapore. And let me tell you, I still crave their ramen until this very day.I got there around 7pm and queue wasn't too long but it is evident that this place is popular as it was packed! What was nice is that they offer free iced Oolong tea outside of the restaurant while you wait. They offer a good variety of ramen from their Ramen Special to Black Spicy to Tsuke men. I ended up getting the Green Spicy Ramen with all toppings and my friend got their Maze Soba. You got to pick the level of soup oil you wanted, saltiness, and firmness of your noodles. Service was quick and while we waited, we grinded some sesame. They also offer unlimited hard boiled eggs, great for those who are a bit hungry and can't wait for their food to come out.When I first tasted my Green Spicy Ramen, oh man... I was pretty much in ramen heaven. The broth was so elegant and had a super nice wasabi flavor. Noodles were made to my liking (I ordered normal). They gave me a good amount of toppings- their eggs and chicken bone were my favorite. I usually don't finish my ramen as the soup is usually quite filling for me. But this time, I made sure to eat every last bite as this was a ramen that I know I can't find else where. As for the Maze Soba, I only took a bite of my friend's and can't quite remember how I liked it but my friend finished it in a heartbeat so I guess that's a good sign lol.Place is also a trendier ramen place with a big community table in the middle and flags + vibrant decorations all around. Great place to hit up after work with your colleagues or catch up with your friends. Highly recommend giving this place a try. Looking forward to the day when I go back to Singapore to eat this ramen again!!!",

But there was also a nutty texture as there was chopped nuts in it too.The noodle used here was similar to the thick flat yellow noodle used for Lor Mee.Spicy but addictive.Tori King Tsuke Men (Dipping Noodles) (S$12.90++)Same as the above dish, the noodle used here was similar to the thick flat yellow noodle used for Lor Mee.The ramen was served with dipping sauce by the side. The dipping sauce was rich and creamy with lots of dried fish flakes and chicken cubes in it. It's signature grilled chicken leg was quite tender but I felt the size of the leg seem to have reduced. I remembered that it used to be quite big. Topup S$2++ for each bowl to up-size.Topup S$5++ for special topping (flavoured egg, 2 pieces of thick bamboo shoot, 2 pieces of tender chicken chashu, 2 pieces of roasted chicken meat balls, Japanese seaweed) for each bowl.With just 2 bowls of ramen, the small table for 2 persons could barely fit in everything.My favourite topping was the chicken meatball which was juicy and crunchy with Yuzu skin for a hint of tangy taste. Similar to the chicken cha shu at Ramen Keisuke Lobster King (another outlet under Ramen Keisuke), there was alcoholic taste which mean that the cha shu could have marinated in sake.Overall the ramen were much better than what I had during my last visit.",

    "text": "I haven't had the best experiences with chicken ramen in general. Usually, it's too mild, sometimes even close to tasting like nothing. And then here comes Tori King - the chicken ramen game changer.Just like any other Keisuke, you would order it based on a sheet, choosing which one you'd like, texture of noodle, amount of oil, what kind of garnishes you'd like, and if you want any extra toppings, like getting an ajitama egg or the special (all the works). It also has free flow hardboiled eggs and beansprouts.I chose the Tori King - the classic chicken ramen which a rich broth, because you know I'm all about creamy broths. One of the first things that you would notice is that every single bowl comes with a giant chicken leg that is so well cooked that you could still taste the crispy skin on the leg. The ajitama that I ordered with my ramen came perfectly cooked, almost as if the hallmark of the perfect bowl of chicken ramen.While this was a great bowl of ramen, I still generally prefer the pork based broths. If you've been burned before by another chicken ramen (looking at you marutama), and have given up all hope on chicken broth ramens, I'd definitely suggest Tori King, to maybe help raise some hopes for chicken broth kind.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of tori (chicken) broth ramen, so I was highly eager to try the ramen here. My favorite in past memory was from Totto Ramen, which managed to create an incredibly comforting flavor that was also rich and complex. The line was about 40 mins long on a Wednesday evening around peak dinner time (7:30pm), but since I didn't know when I would be back in the area, I decided to brave the wait. I liked that the bowl was customizable on several variables: the saltiness, strength of broth and oil, chewiness of the noodles, and toppings. I ordered the Tori King Ramen non-clear soup and stuck to the normal/standard for everything, which runs for S$11.90++. Though soft-boiled egg isn't included in a standard order, they do have FREE UNLIMITED hard-boiled eggs and bean sprouts. A soft-boiled egg is a must have though, and it really should've been included. You could also grind your own sesame seeds to add into the soup, which was a nice touch.The normal texture noodle was already quite chewy and I liked that they used the wavy style of ramen. However, the broth tasted just like CHICKEN SKIN FAT. One redeeming factor is that they claim the soup has lots of collagen in it, but it still felt like it was clogging my arteries. Rather than the chicken soup for the soul type of flavor I was looking for, this had the very raw, chicken-fat-under-the-skin type of flavor, which is actually what I can't stand. Maybe I'd prefer having no chicken oil at all, but the regular tori broth just wasn't for me. I also ordered a wasabi ginger ale, which was intriguing, but the wasabi was hardly noticeable and not worth the purchase.",

    "text": "Dropped by this on a weekend for lunch and was surprised that there was no queue! Was also a bit confused as the signage at the front of the restaurant said \"Kanezin Japan Singapore\" until I saw the menu which confirmed that I was at the right restaurant!Once inside, you will be greeted by their friendly staff (in Japanese of course) and ushered to your seats. Directly in front in a long table which seats 14 people (7 on each side) with all the condiments laid out in the middle. On the right are about four 4 seater tables, some of whih can be further split to fit 2 people. On the left just facing the kitchen are 5 counter seats for those who would like to be close to the action and smell the aromas coming out from the kitchen. When you sit down, you will be given the menu and also a white order form and a pen. You can go through the menu to look at the pictures and descriptions before writing down your orders. For the regulars, they will just go straight to the order form and pen down their orders directly. The order form is quite straightforward, on the top row (Step 1) are their ramen broth choices (Tori King Ramen is the original chicken based broth, Black Spicy (black pepper) Tori King Ramen is my favourite which comes in a dark spicy broth, Green spicy(wasabi) tori king ramen, Tori King Special TanTan Mein is limited to 20 bowls per day, and finally the Kids Meal with Toy & Juice.You can then choose if you want to add additional half noodles, noodles, or soup.Step 2, you can choose your favourite topping of seaweed, flavoured egg (with mushy yolk), pork, or the special which means all 3 items. If you cannot decide, just choose special!Step 3, choose the flavour of soup (light, normal, strong), chicken oil (no oil, less oil, normal, more), and noodle texture (hard, normal, soft).Step 4, finally you can then select which items which you do not want, such as no spring onions, no deep fried onions, or no black fungus.For egg and bean sprout \u00a0fans, you will be happy to hear that there is free flow of hard boiled eggs and bean sprouts at each table. There are both brown and white eggs, and no, it doesnt matter which colour eggs you choose, its all the same on the inside! There is a little sign on the big long table to use the tissue for your egg shells. Maybe its so its easier for the staff to clean up afterwards. There is also a small bowl of white and black sesame seeds and a small wooden grinder which you can use to grind your own sesame seeds if you so wish to. There are also other condiments such as soy sauce, bonito flakes, chilli flakes. \u00a0The chicken that came with the noodles is very juicy and the meat just fell off the bone! By the way, you can just buy the chicken leg for takeaway at S$6 each. The broth is wonderfully thick and rich and you get that sticky aftertaste at the end of the meal. They really have boiled the broth for a very long time to get this kind of flavour and taste. Definitely a place to come back to!",

But this warrant a 5 star review.Ordered the regular non-clear broth ramen (normal saltiness, normal softness, less oil) with the works (nori sheet, half-boiled egg, chicken nuggets, piece of chicken Maryland and extra spring onion. The meal was served quickly, not piping not but that's how I like it (warm). Wow.... First bite was like... being a first time father all over again. Hehe... don't tell my little guy. It was delicious. And the best part.... UNLIMITED HARD BOILED EGGS!!!! Buddy had 3 and I had two. Man... delicious. You... reading this review. I command you to stop reading now and take a flight/cab/run/bike/scoot to 100AM immediately for a bowl of sweet sweet ramen...... I'm not kidding... go now",

    "text": "I started this review in 2013, but as we count down the end to 2014 I'm committed to clearing all my unfinished half-draft-reviews.Ramen Keisuke Tori King is the chicken version of Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King. Wait, you guessed that? It's not even that obvious!Anyway the soup here is (almost) the shizz. While I prefer the porkier flavour of the porcine sister outlet, the chicken thing here is, in local terms, \"damn solid la\". Coupled with the variety of 'styles', green, black, and... well there's no blue but the green and black are both delicious. I really don't think you can go wrong here, except if you underestimate the queue during lunch time (and indeed, even on weekends sometimes). If you like Tonkotsu King, you'll like Tori King. If you don't like Tonkotsu King... then I don't really know what to say to you anyway.",

    "text": "If I had a sister, I would dress her in a sexy outfit, tousle her hair, and send her on a quest to capture the heart of the Tori and Tonkatsu King, Chef Keisuke Takeda (assuming he's not already taken). \u00a0Then I would make a point to eat at their house every damn day of the week!I was skeptical about the ramen \"king\", having slurped down my share of quality bowls, but holy shitake, this guy makes EXCEPTIONAL ramen. \u00a0Ramen Keisuke Tori King has a straightforward menu with 3 types of ramen: plain, black spicy and green. \u00a0You can work the figurative customization knobs on strength and richness of broth and degree of noodle hardness. \u00a0When there is a line outside, the waitstaff provides pens and order sheets so you can figure out what you want in advance. \u00a0That way, once you sit down, it only takes 5 minutes before you get a steaming bowl of ramen plunked down in front of you...followed shortly by a glass of water and a big tub of seasoned bean sprouts.I was first struck by the unexpected full chicken drum and thigh, which turned out to be delightfully tender and tasty with truly delicious and flavorful skin. \u00a0My first spoonful of broth struck me blind, deaf and dumb to everything else going on in the restaurant. \u00a0The only part of my body I was conscious of was my tastebuds, and they were exclaiming, \"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWEE!!!!!!!!! \u00a0YOWZA!!!\" \u00a0The broth captures to an exponential degree the pure essence of chicken, reduced down to the potency where every spoonful feels like it must contain the entire flavor and essence of a whole chicken. \u00a0It is a remarkable taste! \u00a0Although I ordered normal richness, the broth was extremely oily, but I loved every spoonful, and my noodles, which I ordered hard, were perfect. \u00a0As a certified egg-ophile, I was happy to discover that the restaurant also offers unlimited hard boiled eggs to dunk in your broth. \u00a0Although not as delicious as the seasoned eggs, the hard boiled eggs are still delicious and I halved a couple into my soup, spooning broth into the yolks to convey the flavor.PARTING THOUGHT: Must go to Tonkatsu King ASAP!!!",

    "text": "This is now on my must-eat ramen list - yes, it is chicken, I know, and I've had some not-so-stellar chicken ramen in my time, but this is SUCH GOOD CHICKEN. As you queue, you get a great view of guy preparing this amazing chicken, and as you read this, you'll know not to focus on the guy, but on the amazing chicken. Yes, the amazing chicken (you get, it don't you?) gets arranged on a tray, and then gets torched, for some amazing skin char, and that's how it becomes this amazing chicken.As all this happens, you'll want to drool openly, but of course, refrain from such uncouth behaviour. You want to remain polite, and most importantly, keeping the drool off your shirt - the very same one you'll need to be wearing as you walk back to the office.Okay, you've been to the porky cousin, so you know what the system is like. Cool tea out front to appease you while you wait, little slips of paper that show you the three options (normal, black spicy - kinda like Cantonese chili oil, and green spicy - yes, wasabi), and those spices go on top of your chicken.First time means \"try the crazy option\", so I picked black spicy, while my dining companion (was sounds so proper) picked the green. Wah lau. DELICIOUS.Tick the option that gives you all the toppings, and you'll eat, and be satisfied. I could talk more about the ramen-eating experience, but you'll want to come here yourself and ignore everything else I said after the words \"SUCH GOOD CHICKEN\".Last words? Just be patient. Good food is on the way. Or go at 1.30 to avoid the lunch crowd.",

    "text": "The chicken was the highlight, although it was kind of cold despite sitting in warmish soup. The broth was good and not as salty as I expected, having read the yelp reviews complaining about the saltiness, although that might have been because I asked for less chicken oil. The pork was a little bit too hard and dry.It's a little odd that they have you sit across from people that you don't know in the middle table. My girlfriend liked the hard-boiled eggs.I want to go back and try the green tea soda and wasabi ramen. It seemed too complicated of a thing to order on a first trip though. I also like to order a margherita pizza the first time I go to a pizzeria, because it is the purest measure of their skill and a good indication of the quality of their ingredients because it can be easily compared to all the others. For the same reason, I had to go with the basic ramen, and it was great. I also want to try their sister restuarant specializing in gyoza.",

It was early for dinner so the place was empty which is nice b/c usually there's a long line (or as Singaporeans call it, a long queue, is it?).The ramen is tasty, the noodles are some of the best I've ever had in a ramen and the chicken thigh that comes with the ramen is AMAZING. The tender meat just falls off the bone and is so delicious. Never had anything like it in a ramen.The broth was really thick and not that great... it was pretty heavy. I had the regular ramen, not the spicy one.The other cool thing about this place is the big jar of pickled sprouts to top your ramen and the eggs on every table.Worth checking out but it's a tad pricey for ramen. I think we paid close to $40 for 2 - beware the GST ++",
