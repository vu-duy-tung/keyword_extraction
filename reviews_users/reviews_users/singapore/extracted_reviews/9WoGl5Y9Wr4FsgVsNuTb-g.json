They also have the fried dough that complements the congee nicely. Too bad singapore don't have a true winter otherwise it would be the place to go in the nice cold brisk.Food is good.Price is reasonable but just under the expensive mark for a congee.",

Tiny, stale prawns, wrapped in rice rolls. The rice rolls, to their credit, was very smooth and chewy. The sauce used lots of dark soy sauce, which made it all in all overwhelming. Meh.",

    "text": "I've been here for lunch once and was with my boss's so didn't really concentrate too much in the food. The gf was craving Chee Cheong Fun and I suddenly thought of this place. Now this is a place that lives up to its name! We went for a standard Char Siew (sweet roasted pork) Cheong fun, a mushroom Cheong Fun, Century Egg And pork porridge and the raw fish. First the raw fish. I love my raw fish. I adore it. I crave for it but this one.... This one disappointed me a little. Not that is wasn't fresh but well;,. Firstly they use a different fish. I believe the regular market/food Centre \u9c7c\u751f (raw fish) uses Ikan Parang while this one tasted like snapper fillets. No that I'm complaining about the texture, but what bothered me was the additional Acar. A) I'm not a big fan of Acar to begin with and b) I think the sweetness from the Acar spoils the dish. Gone was that salty, sour (from the lime) \u9c7c\u751f dish that I loved. Next came the porridge. What I loved about the porridge here was how thick it was! Unlike the usual \"as-smooth-as-you-can\" style of Cantonese porridge houses, this place likes their porridge chunky and if you're a fan of century egg like we are, you have to do the $1.00 add-on for century eggs. What you'll get in return is a century egg porridge packed with so many pieces that you're guaranteed at least 1 piece egg with every spoon. Next came the 2 Cheong funs. The mushroom Cheong fun was alright. It was a play safe option since we couldn't decide on what to order after the Char Siew. The char Siew on the other hand was really nice. Char Siew wasn't dry and they used a good mix of fat and meat. But what really stood out for both dishes were how soft the Cheong fun itself was! Picking up with chopsticks alone was a challenge and when popped in the mouth, you get this wonderfully light smooth texture that almost melts in your mouth. Definitely one of the best Cheong funs I've had in a while. Overall... This place was worth the short walk in the sun but it could be quite warm if you're lunching there. We'll be back to try their other unique Cheong funs like cheese and lobster and abalone.",

Thank god that my children love durian as much as I do, so we always order their durian chee cheong fun and occasionally their prawn chee cheong fun. Other than that their frog leg with chili and porridge are great if you're looking for some local breakfast dishes. To top it off, order their homemade calamansi and barley juice for some fresh beverage.",

If you dont get what you want, be sure to ask.Come on a cold rainy day... u'll thank me.",

Nothing special.I do have to admit that the cheung fun was delicious though! The made-to-order rolls were so fresh and tender with a good bite to the rice sheet. \u00a0Tried the cha siew and fresh prawn flavors - both good but I enjoyed the latter more. \u00a0They had a lot of advertising for their special durian flavored cheung fun but I didn't end up trying it. \u00a0I generally like to eat my durian as is and not cooked into anything.Overall an ok place but also a tad more expensive than a usual small shop like this.",

It's located along Killiney Road and is well-known for offering weird exotic options such as Durian chee cheong fun. I'm not a fan of durian at all, so I usually order my standard century egg porridge and then a char siew chee cheong fun (BBQ pork) . The century egg porridge is very average and unremarkable, but I find the chee cheong fun is damn delicious!! The meal is quite good value for money as it costs me under $10. \u00a0 \u00a0 Apart from the famous durian chee cheong fun, they do also have more interesting and expensive options such as Lobster chee cheong fun, tom yum chee cheong fun and abalone. So come down with a couple of people and feast on the wide plethora of rice rolls.",

The rice rolls (cheong fun) are HK style with the dark sauce; decently tasty, but a little pricey for what you're eating, and the $3.00 they charge for a plain porridge (a little starchy?) seemed quite OTT too.I picked some deep fried intestines to eat with the porridge, and I felt they were over-fried (or maybe re-fried?). Same with the you tiao.It could be a palce to come to if you're feeling adventurous, since they've got lobster and durian cheong fun (separate ones though, can't imagine them together at all!).I might come back if I had a cheong fun craving, but... maybe not so soon.p.s. quick shout out to the pushy uncle who hovered behind me as I tried to finish up my meal, just waiting to clean up. Really? there's plenty of other tables your customers can sit at before you need mine back.",

The made to order chee cheong fun is a little different from the traditional Cantonese style ones, but they taste equally as well. The skin of the cheong fun is very thin and smooth and melts in your mouth. My personal favourites are the char siew cheong fun and the youtiao cheong fan that are perfect as snacks.If you're feeling a little adventurous, you can always try their durian cheong fun, which according to friends who have tried it, is totally out of this world!",

True to its name, House of rice roll & porridge specializes in 2 dishes, with an extensive variety to each. The Hong Kong-styled rice rolls, or chee cheong fun as the locals call it, are smooth silky rice rolls wrapped around a filling and doused in dark sauce. Some of the more peculiar rice roll flavors I noticed from the menu include braised intestines, cheese lobster, the fruit-flavored, and durian. Adventurous souls can try the durian rice roll; it is their signature dish after all. Other than that, customers can stick to safer choices like the century egg pork congee or fish congee, which do not pale in comparison with regards to taste.",
