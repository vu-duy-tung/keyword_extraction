    "text": "AURA is located in the new National Gallery of Singapore. Besides its quaint location, this Italian restaurant serves a wide array of wine that complements with their food. Plus point! They have very fresh, yummy homemade pasta. I am very particular about pasta as it is my favourite noodle, so naturally its flavour, the chewiness, the presentation all comes together as one when I review whether I should visit them again. \u00a0This is one of the few restaurants that blown me away with al dente pasta, hearty portions, worth every penny price points and impeccable service.The bar also has a picturesque night's view of Marina Bay, recommend you making a reservation before you go over. Without alcohol its about $100 a person with a three course meal, but if you just order a pasta and a non alcoholic drink, $50 per person will suffice. Great for date nights and corporate dining.",

    "text": "The restaurant is located at the going to open National Gallery Singapore. It is opened by Beppe de Vito who is the one behind il Lido in Sentosa. The restaurant offers Italian cuisine in posh style. The main restaurant is located at the level 5, the sky lounge is located at level 6. With a restaurant week reservation, it is interesting to find that I am being showed to a table at the sky lounge. The place has both aircon and alfresco dining areas, overlooking the The Padang, with a great view of Marina Bay Sands. Today we are having the restaurant week lunch which costs $40++ per person and consists of a starter, a pasta, a main and a dessert, with bread and coffee or tea included.We start the meal with some breads, served with olive oil dip. While the bread is not served hot, it is soft and fluffy inside. Hokkiado Scallops Crudo with Truffle ($25)The raw scallops are lightly seasoned, and goes quite well with the tangy sweet pomegranate arils (seeds) and puree sauce. The dish is served in a colorful and playful, which looks very appetizing. The smoked quail egg is like mini version of the lava egg which is usually found in ramens. Whole Wheat Stracci with Duck & Foie Gras ($32)We are surprised with the chunks of foie gras, which tastes buttery smooth. Although the dish is filled with minced duck meat, the gamey taste of duck is not overwhelming here.For mains, there is 2 choices available.Black Cod with Beetroot and Porcini MushroomsThe cod is juicy and chunky, served a richly colorful bed of beetroot puree. Beef Sirloin with Asparagus and Red Wine SauceThe serving is rather small, about half the size when compared to the cod. Although cooked medium, the texture is a bit tough than preferred. There is barely any sauce.Lastly for dessert, we haveStrawberry, Pistachio & Chocolate Profiteroles ($18)Although the dessert is simply profiteroles, they are distinct in their own taste, especially the pistachio - strong in flavour and light without feeling too creamy.We end the meal with a selection of Fine Teas and Coffee.Overall the food is not bad. Service is not bad too, although it would be better if the staff has made a better job of clearing the bread crumbs on the table. It is not often to see staff using the metal ruler like stuff to clear the table. The restaurant is such a relaxing place that 2.5 hours of lunching has gone in a blink.",

    "text": "Visited for lunch on a Friday. The set lunch (Green Asparagus Soup, Linguine Bolognese, Mango Delice) looked boring, so we decided to order from the main menu instead to share.We had:Scallops Crudo with Truffle and Smoked Quail Eggs - this came BEAUTIFULLY presented, complete with edible flowers and ikura topping the raw scallops on a bed of mashed avocado. This was unanimously the best dish of the meal. The scallops were fresh and flavorful. Definitely order this, it's a delight for the senses.Spaghetti with Crab and Porcini - they were generous with the crab; thick juicy chunks swirled with the spaghetti. Crab was the star of the dish, the sauce and porcini just average. Enjoyable though.Burrata Cheese Ravioli with Amatriciana - I found this a little too cheesy, though my other 2 dining companions did enjoy it quite a bit. Only order this if you are a fan of cheese and carbs. But it went well with the sauce and crunchy bits to provide texture.Italian Seabass with Artichokes and Saffron Sauce - fish was nicely cooked, though I'd have liked the skin slightly crispier. The saffron sauce didn't stand out, and there was a tad too much artichoke. The food was decent, though not mindblowing for its price ($142 in total incl tax/service). Only the scallops stood out. The 3 of us left decently satisfied. Good place for business lunches.",

So it's worth coming up here to see the view. But the service is non-existent. Waiters take forever to come over. One evening I was there with friends, we had to wait at least 5 minutes for anyone to pay attention to us. We just plonked ourselves down after we got tired of waiting (the lack of service was not due to crowds, in fact, the place was practically empty although there were tables outdoors which were occupied). We literally were helping ourselves to napkins because the waiter did not come over, forgot to deliver even after one of my friends went over to ask and we finally got so fed up one of us walked over to the bar to get the napkins. The bar food is decent but not spectacular. Given the prices they charge, it'd better be edible. So be forewarned. Come here for drinks only if you want a view and do not mind slow, patchy service.",

Well that's what we tried and everything was delicious. Service is super slow, they serve one course at a time. My water glass was always empty, same comment as another girl on trip advisor: she had to serve herself the drinks.

I went there for brunch on a Sunday; the first thing that hits you as you enter is the buzz running through the restaurant, not raucous, but sufficiently energetic so you don't get any of the usual stuffiness in museum restaurants. Service is attentive but not uptight; \u00a0the wait staff strike a good balance of professionalism and chumminess, offering suggestions for life-changing dishes (which btw was the grilled octopus). One waiter even offered to move us when he saw us struggling with our stroller in a packed corner. I really liked the interior - comfy seating, classy combo of white marble, brass, and lovely lighting pieces. The food was very good - I didn't think it was life-changing, but everything we ordered was solid. We started with the grilled octopus and tuna tartare. Both were delicious, but the octopus at Bochinche still has my heart. For mains, we had the duck stracci with foie gras and their signature taglialini with scampi. The duck ragout was the winner here - homely and full of flavour. For dessert we had the hazelnut feuillantine, which was super indulgent with lovely texture. My prosecco was fruity and perfect for brunch; my husband was pretty happy with his pinot noir.Aura is just what Singapore needs more of - versatile option for date night, an important business meeting, must-do for visitors to Singapore, or a great spot for boozy grown-up brunch with friends.",
