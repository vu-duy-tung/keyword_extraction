I recommend mixing the extra hot sauce with their wild herb sauce to get a good amount of heat and after kick. Come for the chicken, but pass on the sides.",

Aside from the great food, their staff was still pleasant and attentive with our requests despite the fact that we came in 30 minutes before closing time. I'm so in love with their sauces! It's a good thing they have it here in our local supermarket. I'm making a mental note to include it in my grocery list soon.",

Getting any attention from the staff took another 15 mins. \u00a0When we finally did manage to get someone to come to our table (by going to the kitchen area and interrupting the staff chatting amongst themselves while ignoring their customers), it turns out they had completely forgotten the second half of our meal. By this point we were happy to just leave. Their offer to not charge us for our pot of tea as compensation for half a meal being delivered and the other half being completely cold while we waited for the rest did not go down well! Disgusting service, do yourself a favour and avoid this Nandos.",

    "text": "Having tried the Nandos in Australia and London, I have high standards for this chain. It is disappointing that Singapore has decided to market it as a proper restaurant rather than the fast food/casual dining concept overseas. The Katong branch was disappointing with the chicken too dry and flavours lacking, but upon hearing good things about the Bugis Junction branch, I decided to give it another shot. The chicken comes in various flavours ranging from mild to extra hot, and my usual order of extra hot \u00a0piece chicken with peri peri chips was a very good comparison to the ones I've had in Australia. The meat was succulent, even with breast meat, and the peri peri sauce was flavourful and sufficient. The peri peri chips were good too, although more peri peri salt wouldn't have hurt. Overall, I the food was good, but unfortunately, at the end of the day it's still much better overseas and cheaper too.",

    "text": "Walking past Nando's was always accompanied by a glimpse of mouth-watering chicken glistening in its famous peri-peri sauce. Food-wise, the chicken pita I ordered was average with nothing much to rave about. In fact, the chicken was on the dry side instead of the juicy chunks I was expecting. However, its mild peri-peri sauce deserved a thumbs up. The balance of herbs mixed with just the right amount of spiciness was perfect as an accompaniment to alleviate the filling of the pita. Each bite of the veggies has a lingering smokey aftertaste that leaves you craving for another bite. Although not the best i've had, Nando's is worth a try as a quick fix for cravings for smokey flavours. But do take note that service levels at the JCube branch are not quite satisfactory. The branch was severely understaffed and somewhat not attentive. Waving frantically when they looked vaguely in our direction was probably the only way to get their attention. Definitely not the most ideal, but forgivable for a heartland mall I guess.",

The chicken was well seasoned and flavorful. The chicken breast slices that came with the salad were perfect compared to the half chicken which was a little on the burnt side. The mashed sweet potatoes, corn on the cob, and salad were all excellent. My girlfriend said it was now one of her favorite restaurant at the end of the meal.",

In Singapore you can find the exact same offering however at a much higher price. Nando's over here offers table service but with poor standards service and guess what, water is chargeable! The chicken here in Singapore is really dry and under seasoned. Honestly it gives first timers a bad impression of a brand that actually serves up really good grilled chicken!",
