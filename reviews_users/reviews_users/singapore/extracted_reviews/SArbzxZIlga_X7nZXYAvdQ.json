    "text": "Was here on Christmas for dinner and it was pretty empty at around the time we went there, around 6:30pm when they are open for dinner. The definition of \"Eentrecote\" steak is the cut between sirloin and ribeye and thus you should not be expecting a very tender cut. For $39.90, the portion is pretty filling at 200g for one piece of the Classic steak. If that is not enough, you have unlimited fries with the steak.Each order of the steak includes a salad with walnuts, but somehow the salad here is extremely stingy with the dressing. Other than that it was ok.Back to the steak, I ordered medium rare and it was pretty much cooked to medium rare, pinkish on the inside and charred on the outside. The meat isn't really marinated much (I don't think it has been aged much as well) so you definitely have to rely on the sauce to give it some flavor.Next the fries, I upgraded my fries to truffle fries and having had the truffle mushroom soup from Ristorante Da Valentino the previous day, there is really a stark difference despite the truffle oil used should be much more for the fries. It is a little hard to get the truffle smell (much less the taste). The normal fries were oily, salty but very crispy. If you like fries of this nature, it will very nice, for me, it was a little too greasy and salty.Service wise, I guess the waiter serving us was pretty new so it was not as good as it should be, when you order Mussels, there should be an additional big plate for the shells, but we were given a small one which probably couldn't fit all the shells. I knew this because a table near us had a bigger plate.I would say this is a pretty average place for steak, though their Duxton outlet is way better in terms of service and ambience. The main attraction to this place should be the location at Suntec City.",

    "text": "Trying to emulate the Parisian atmosphere in Singapore can be a challenge but certainly this place needs a little more help to do the steak and frites experience justice. While I get that the restaurant is trying to have an upclass act at a reasonable rate, the experience doesn't match the intention. Sure, the staff were polite and tries their very best but I had the impression that they were severely understaff and the quality of the food wasn't even of restaurant quality. I can even cite some food court/hawker center stalls doing better steak and fries. If it is your signature dish, I would really recommend you focussing on it.But to give this place credit, the fish I ordered was of a decent quality. I enjoyed it as compared to the steak. The salted caramel tart I ordered was a tad too sweet and not liquidy enough. Again, a brave attempt but it just isn't value for money. Would rather head somewhere else for a good slab of meat.",

    "text": "Honestly, the main reason I went in search of L'entrecote was for the unlimited fries promo I heard about on Facebook. To my dismay, the article didn't specify that the unlimited fries promo was only available if you had the steak. Neither my husband nor I eat beef so you can imagine our disappointment.Food - The food wasn't exceptional, it was decent at best. My husband had the lamb pasta while I had the salmon pasta. The salmon was overcooked and given sparingly. Each of the pasta dishes cost $20. A small bowl of fries was priced at $5 and we were given the option of truffle fries as a $3 add on. The truffle fries were pretty decent.Service - They were clearly understaffed with waiters doing the dishes as well. They brought around a dessert, asking customers to \"try\" (purchase) some, but they were courteous. It was very difficult to get the waiter's attention, but that was understandable because of the lack of manpower.Atmosphere - The decor was a little out of place; the rustic interior felt odd considering it was in the middle of Suntec City. I (personally) was very turned off by the waiters writing our order on the paper table cloths instead of a notepad/iPad. Overall, I feel that the food is definitely not worth the money. I can't say I was happy they charged me $5 for a glass of coke AND made me pay a 10% service charge for the non-service I received.",

    "text": "I was so thrilled to finally dine at L'Entrec\u00f4te after attempting to try their other outlet. However, when the Stwak and fries aka French bistro food arrived, the steak had no marinate and the cut if the beef was bad. I asked for a medium rare and it came like a medium well. The steak tastes so bland and the cheap cut of the beef did not make the meal taste any better. The only saving grace of this place is that they have Tabasco hot sauce.",

    "text": "This place is super confused. It's like they want to be upscale, but then like super casual at the same time. The decor at the location in suntec city was super mixed. Think French vintage food advertisements, paper table cloth, dark woods, all in a mall. It was just strange. The steak itself was decent, a bit tough and I wished the sauce came on the side. It was almost as if they smothered it to hide the quality. It's a slight mustard, peppery, butter sauce that I was not a fan of. We also ordered mussel frittes and the mussels were under seasoned. It lacked garlic, salt, and flavor. They tasted as though they were frozen, thawed, and thrown in a premade grease soup. I would not come back.",
