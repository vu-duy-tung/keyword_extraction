Dim sum was pricey but used excellent quality ingredients. \u00a0First course was an excellent herbal Fish Maw soup served from a miniature clay teapot.The Wok baked lobster with XO sauce was also excellent but limited to one serving. The selection of dim sum was not extensive but the seafood, poultry, vegetable and beef and pork dishes provided other dishes that were not dim sum. The best dish was the combo of bbq pork, soy sauce chicken, duck and roasted pork. Porridge and noodle dishes were",

    "text": "Not only were all of the food delicious, it was also very well executed and presented. We ordered a duck dish where the duck skin were rolled in a wrap (much like a mushu wrap dish). This was a great combination of a well balaned savory dish with contrasting textures. You have a choice of how your duck meat gets cooked (unlike traditional Peking duck where you wrap the meat in a bun). We opted for a lettuce stir fry and it was by far the best duck dish I've had! We also ordered a vegetable dish and you could tell how fresh the vegetable was and it was cooked to perfection. Lastly, the service was exceptional where our servers were very attentive and accommodating.",

Damage was 98++ per person.Started off with the complimentary abalone soup and lobster steamed with egg white. Abalone wasn't chewy, so that was good. The lobster was unfortunately very plain, I had to drizzle soy sauce over it for taste.We ordered a bunch of items - egg tarts, custard buns, fried scallops in XO sauce, chicken feet; the standard dim sum items with a few dishes thrown in. The quality of the dimsum there is generally good, you won't go wrong here. For what it's worth, my friend loved the sweet and sour pork here, and polished off two plates of it. Though I have no idea why anyone would order that for dimsum...",

    "text": "For more reviews and full reviews, visit my blog!There's nothing like pampering oneself at a luxury hotel. Every whims and fancy would have been thought of and catered to so that one could go into vegetation and relax comfortably. The St. Regis provides all that customized service and attention with panache, as evidenced by accolades heaped on by many renowned publications around the world. The same standards apply to the restaurants as well and i was fortunate to experience what fine Cantonese dining means at the award winning Yan Ting. We had a special 7 course set designed to give us a preview of the 10 CNY set menus that Yan Ting has this Snake year. Think of this as a best of dishes list. Yu Sheng is a must have dish for CNY. Every component has its own significance and mostly related to wealth and luck. Yan Ting has switched the radish for snow pear to give the dish its subtle sweetness. I like that the sauce is lot less sweet than the usual Yu Sheng because pomelo juice is added. Abalone and Salmon are also included in this dish.Pun Choy is a classic CNY dish. This casserole pot dish came about when villagers offered the best ingredient they have in their home for sharing during the festive season in the old days. All the contributed ingredients would then be placed, layer upon layer, with the blandest ingredient (typically the vegetables) at the bottom and the meat on top. The end result would be a rich and flavorful stew that is delicious and satisfying.Yan Ting's Pun Choy is the luxe version with abalone, dried scallops, dace fish, pork belly, fish maw, prawns, roasted duck and soya sauce chicken, layered on a bed of white radish and cabbage. This is no doubt one of my favorite dishes of the night. You could also take this away for reunion dinner at home. Each takeaway order receives a complimentary Salmon \"Yu Sheng\" with Fish Roe, and Fried Glutinous Rice with Preserved Meat, all stellar dishes. This is a great leftover dish because the flavors are more intense overnight and the ingredients more tender. Definitely my favorite leftover CNY dish. :)The Steamed Sea Perch Fillet with Special Coral Sauce is minimally flavored to allow diners a clear taste of this premium ingredient. It's so premium that only top Chinese restaurants serve this fish. This deep sea fish is more expensive than cod fish and richer in omega 3 content. Definitely not something that you can get at the supermarket. The taste and texture of the sea perch is very delicate and doesn't taste as oily and heavy as cod. This is great for health conscious folks. More dishes in btn...Till that point in the dinner, I had been sampling all the dishes in an effort not to overeat. But when the Wok Fried Glutinous rice with Wind Dried Sausages was served, i finished every single grain. The dish is very simple but it tastes like home, very heart (and tummy) warming. I guess i tasted the effort Chef put into bringing in the special wind dried Chinese sausages from Hong Kong.The Set Lunch and Dinner Menus are priced $98 to $328++ per pax, with a minimum of 2 guests. There is also an 8 course Vegetarian set menu at $108++ per pax. Other than set menus, there is also a special \u00e1 la carte menu and some dishes are also available for takeaway from now till 24th Feb 201",

    "text": "I used to love Yan Ting and was a big fan when they first opened years ago. However, since then, it seems the standards have deteriorated and the dim sum has become pretty inconsistent... Based on my last visit there (last week), none of the dim sum was impressive at all. We got the... Har Kau, Steamed Vegetable Dumpling, Salted Egg Custard Pau, Char Siew Pastry, Spinach w 3 kinds egg (not on the menu but they can do it upon request), Chicken Feet, Deep Fried Eggplant w Pork Floss, Roasted Duck and the Siu Yuk (Roasted Pork Belly).The only thing that really stood out, out of all the dishes was the Siu Yuk, which they do very well (the skin perfectly roasted and crisp and the meat incredibly tender). But that was about the only good dish we had there, everything else was simply mediocre at best. Except for the Char Siew Pastry, which is usually my favorite but tasted bad this round - strangely enough, it actually tasted dough-y. On the bright side, I love the St Regis and the ambience of the restaurant is classy and upscale, obviously very gorgeously decorated. But with so much good dim sum in Singapore, I'm not sure how Yan Ting is going to stay in business (especially since they're priced so high - approx $5 for 3pcs of dim sum).In terms of hotel dim sum restaurants, I'd pick Hua Ting at Orchard Hotel over this.2 - 2.5 stars, mainly because I've experienced much better.",

Here is my link for the full review, I need to update the blog with the second visit and new items. mylifeinsin.com/2013/04/\u2026It isn't cheap, I must say, but you get over 3 hours of dim sum and other Cantonese food, and champagne of course, very important! I really liked the cute dumplings with three areas, one with mushrooms, one with carrots and one with celery I think. The soy sauce chicken is really really good, tender and flavourful. Crispy bean curd skin was great too. As well as the mushrooms and veggies. And my all time favourite was an utter revelation, vegetarian olive fried rice..... yummmmm! Sesame coated chocolate was also lovely. Check out my blog for more info and more reviews :)",

    "text": "In Singapore, not lacking in dim sum joint, can be seen in almost all Chinese restaurants, the only pain is the ability to single out the best during the seemingly simple pick & choose process. Here, Yan Ting has quite a few exceptionally good dim sum but some mediocre micro dishes; unlimited orders when you opt for a buffet-style. Instead of seeing a table-spread, this a la carte fashion allows you to order freely from the menu list - the a la minute way. Without repeating the dishes I have tired previously (the chef at work remains unchanged), I returned to savour 85% new ones, picked from 95 items, all vying for my attention!The orchestra start-off with ONE serving of Doubled-boiled Abalone Soup with Chicken (Braised Shark's Fin with Crab Roe previously - I guess you know why), full-bodied with clear seafood aroma but way too acrid for my likings. Rather, I preferred that Doubled-boiled Bamboo Pith Consomm\u00e9 with Shiitake Mushroom and Morel (bottom featured) - unclouded & subtle, \u00a0light broth with high quality fungi, very pleasant.Then you proceed to reward yourself with a portion of Lobster, the most celebrated chronicle was the Gratinated Cheese & Bacon - a sophisticated version baked using cheese that was smooth and rich and turned even more flavourful with the added bacon bits. The other Wok-baked in Superior broth & Spring Onion was paler but suits someone with a light palate.Highlighting the dim sum - Yan Ting seriously has the best BBQ Pork Char Siew Pastry in town. Consistent in taste except the changed in shape, the generous char siew fillings hit the spot every time. Others commented on the stingy stuffings and it makes me wonder if they desire a pail of it as I could see them almost piercing through the thin flaky pastry skin! The same in the past, never reduced in portion. I keep pictures of it if you wish proof lol. Less of any awful porky stench, the barbecue sauce coating the meat was gooey and sweet, together with the rich and melty pastry skin, I screamed for a second helping! They taste better than Shang Palace's, I confessed. But the latter has got a better Steamed BBQ Pork Bun \"Char Siew Bao\". Though both have a pillowy bun - soft and not palate sticking, Yan Ting's pork fillings lacked robustness and I'd prefer a dark chocolatey-hue, full of caramelised flavour from Shang Palace. Yan Ting's version wasn't that bad, it's just a personal choice.I didn't expect to reach anticlimax this soon, if you asked - skip the Stir-fried \"Cheong Fun\" Rice Rolls with XO Sauce. It sounds painful but the chef has declared the annulment of their marriage. The exceptionally good XO sauce has gone to waste when it failed to permeate the rice rolls, merely coating them - tasteless with a missing soul. Feedback delivered.My chemistry with rest of the dim sum was forceful if not weak. The weaker ones are the ovoid Deep Fried Yam Croquettes with Diced Chicken comes with a shattery outermost yam mash that envelopes some dull chicken mass - barely seasoned with a flat taste. The Har Kao & steamed Siew Mai have always been fresh and dewy in their constitution especially one nibble at the succulent shrimps in the pleated piece that offers a smooth and silky skin though I have never liked a Har Kao. Adequately seasoned, the thin yellow wrappers stuffed with fleshy minced pork/prawn mixture are topping themselves with crab roe, these Siew Mai make strong opponents.When the appetiser comes into picture, I have made a clear identification that the Soy Sauce Chicken topped my list. Images of plumpish chicken poaching in light soy sauce that perfumed the pot, excites me with immediate urge to bite into that tender, smooth bird fragments. Every bite comforts me with a lingering cinnamon, star anise cologne and tamed my excitement with a gentle rock sugar sweetness. The rest of the meat selections lost the race. Lacking the familiarity, the Roasted Duck requires that needing crisp in the skin but the meat is less fibrous -good. The pork has a louder taste in its meat; but the roasted version fared slightly better than its barbecued cousins, for its ultra crunchy blistered skin but too salty. If you want something to nibble on, the Deep-fried Whitebait makes good choice, while the pulpy Marinated Jellyfish lends a good chew with a strong scallion oil scent. Less impressive, the Beef Shank with Soy Sauce, not astonishingly tender and I thought the chicken & soy sauce still make a perfect couple.I had a deep swim in the sea, both the Deep-fried \"Live\" Soon Hock & Poached Cod Fish worth the attempt. Silky with loads of freshness in the meat. No fishy stench, only clean tasting in some clear light broth that didn't required much seasoning - simple & flavourful. Try Stir-Fried Scallops with Honey Beans - enjoyed a few tender & silken mollusks nested within some great crunchy pods with a stir of Chinese olives, its briny nature accentuate the sweetness in them.",
