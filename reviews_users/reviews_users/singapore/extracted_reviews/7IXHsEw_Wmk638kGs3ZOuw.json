    "text": "I ordered crust pizza delivery on a Friday night, as I was stuck at home with a swollen leg and pretty much immobile. I ordered a Meat Deluxe pizza and the grilled char siew wings.This is one of those rare instances where the food looks better than it tastes. The pizza certainly gourmet and hand formed, topped with real food like chicken, ham and sausage. However, it was remarkably dry and flat. I tasted a sweet base, probably from the barbecue sauce and then a whole lot of dry indistinguishable meat in my mouth. No punchy cheeses or seasoning and yes, I did add chili flakes as a backup and even that wasn't spicy. The barbecued wings fared better and were rather novel. Nicely charred and not oily at all.I normally eat pizzas at La Nonna and Pepp Pizza, which have the same price point and \"fresh ingredients only\" marketing angle. I'd say those two joints serve way better pizzas. I would argue that maybe my pizza wasn't as great because it was delivery, but I've had Pepp pizza delivered and it still tasted great. Maybe the Crust boxes have some dehydrating agent embedded... I don't know. Another thing I considered was that this was Australian style pizza. I haven't the slightest idea what that means but I sure hope they get tastier, juicier pies than this down under or they are missing out big time.Nonetheless, if you're hungry and you like real ingredients on your plate and don't want the minimum spend required for Pepp delivery, Crust is the next best thing I supposed. Would eat there if I had choice and flexibility but it does the job when you've got the munchies.",

    "text": "We ordered two pizzas and a salad. Everything was terrible.-The delivery took about an hour.-Our food was put in a tied plastic bag, which means the crusts were soggy when it arrived.-Despite the crust being soggy, the pizza was dry. There was virtually no sauce on it and the toppings were dried out.-We ordered two 13\"x8\" pizzas. Or at least we thought we did. The BOX has those dimensions, the pizzas were much smaller.-The salad was way too small. They said it feeds two. it doesn't.Everything cost me $72. I spent $72 on JUNK. Don't eat here. It's a rip off.",

    "text": "Friends had been raving about Crust for a while so we thought we'd check it out over a long weekend.The boys really liked the bright red char siew chicken wings with sweet chilli sauce. We ordered two pizzas to share, one much lauded roast duck pizza as well as the spicy pesto scallops pizza.The pizzas looked better than they tasted ... the former was a bit too sweet because of the hoisin sauce and the latter whilst interesting was just OK. Service when we got there was pretty rubbish, the silly boy claiming someone had reserved the tables when it was available. Thankfully this was quickly remedied by the proprietor.",

We typically do half of sausage duo and half gourmet cheese for a healthier option. I recommend sticking to their pizza thou. Not a big fan of their chicken wings as it lacks flavor to me",

Not too much of a truffle taste that it masks the taste of the whole pizza, and the baked asparagus gives it a crunch. The crust is a tad sweet too, so it somehow goes with the balsamic dressing to create a well-balanced taste. In general, the food is pretty good and relatively healthy!",
