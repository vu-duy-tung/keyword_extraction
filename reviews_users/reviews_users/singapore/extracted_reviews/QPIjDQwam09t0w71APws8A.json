The food is good but the price is a little on the higher side. It'd probably more worth it to have tea here at $15 per pax as their cakes and pastries look so appetizing and beautiful.",

    "text": "I was on one of my regular trips to Gardens by the Bay. Yes, I love heading to the gardens for a nice stroll. This morning I was kind of hungry so I thought I could drop by at the Bakerzin located near the ticketing office.Originally I just wanted maybe a croissant and a hot beverage. Then the staff gave me a full menu. When I saw they have Fish n Chips, I did not think twice and decided to have a heavier lunch. I always love a good plate of Fish n Chips; unfortunately the best I ever tasted was still the one in London. I have also ordered a hot chocolate, I know Fish N Chips does not really go with hot chocolate, but who cares? Lol!!The order of hot chocolate came first. It was not too bad. Hot chocolate usually makes me happy. A good one of cos. Soon the Beer Battered Classic Fish N Chips arrived at the table. The portion was a little too big for me but trust that I would not have a problem if it turned out to be good.First bite - hmmm.. what kind of fish was that? Definitely not cod. It was kind of oily. I took a look at the picture I took off the menu, leather jacket fillet? What was that? If this is a Classic Fish N Chips, I want my regular tartar sauce & vinegar. The tartar sauce looked like cocktail sauce. Turned out it was Asian tartar sauce. Huh? Ok my bad, I did not look at the description of the Fish N Chips before I ordered it. So zero star for the Fish N Chips. Ambience was alright. I wish it was a lot quieter. I had been wondering which customers were talking that loudly. Turned out it was the staffs who were chatting and talking so loudly as if they were just next to me :O Service received was great - 4 stars but I had to deduct 2 for the noise they generated. It was not a pleasant experience to constantly hearing the staffs talking so loudly. Mind you, I was sitting all the way inside and tucked in one corner.",

    "text": "Visiting the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest does not offer many options for food or refreshment. I highly suggest to eat before visiting or pack your lunch and eat on the grounds. The service here was indifferent. They could take or leave us. We asked questions that could not be fully answered. (is there cheese in this?)The food was unremarkable. Pearl barley salad had almost no salad. Fisherman's basket was soggy. The fried foods were bland. Thing that bothered me the most was this: Bakerzin is located within steps of the ticket booth (before you arrive at ticket booth) and the servers did not mention that you can get 5 dollars off your meal with the purchase of \u00a0tickets to Flower Dome/Cloud Forest. Small thing yes but it all comes back to customer service. They have none.",

This is the nearest causal eatery after you spend hour(s) walking through the Flower/Cloud Dome. So in a way, beggars can't be choosers.My family just done the Cloud Dome and wanted a quick break before heading for the Flower Dome.We seated ourselves at the outdoor seating as no one was mending the outdoor area at that time. Shortly, the staff just came by and dropped off the menu without saying a word. My sis had to walk into the cafe to have a staff come over to take our orders. We ordered a long black, cappuccino, root beer and a plate of potato wedges. The coffee were average and wedges were slightly above average but portion was really tiny for the $8.90 price! Likewise we had to walk into the cafe to request for the bill. Overall, it's a little overpriced cafe with a nice ambience. It's lovely to sit outdoors but be warned that service will be slow and almost nonexistent.",

    "text": "I came here to hide out from the relentless rain. It seemed like almost everyone had the same idea. It was fairly crowded with few empty tables and seats. It took a while before a server noticed the line of people waiting to be seated.I chose a counter seat outside which overlooked the gardens or shrubbery since I just wanted a drink. Again, it took some time for my drink to arrive and also to get the bill. Service was just slow. The place itself was pretty nice. A good place to just chill with a book and drink and dessert. It is definitely not a place to grab a quick bite or where you want attentive service. Yelp Feb 2014 Challenge: 7/28",

Here at this place, they serve room temperature food with a cold face. There is no facial expressions on any of them.--+The only thing that is edible at this place is baked sausage. Bratwurst sausage is not overly salted, sauteed potato and the mushrooms looks awful together, \u00a0but it tasted way better than it looks. --- Mushroom soup looks like a bit bowl of snot, it tasted over salted and it didn't have much aroma of mushroom. \u00a0--- Bratwurst linguini looks gross when it came. It looked like hot \u00a0dark chocolate sauce over the linguini. \u00a0 Balsamic vinegar was over powering the soggy linguine. Gross. +++Iced mango passion float in sprite is refreshing and nice. It wasn't special, but at least, it wasn't gross. --- Iced chocolate was overly sweetened. Save your money and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "The only thing I could find in Gardens by the Bay that wasn't too far away and of a decent price range. I'd been to Bakerzin at Suntec before and had a pretty good experience there, so I thought this would be fine. I ordered the Aglio Olio for $13, which was a decent price considering where we were. The service, however, was absolutely awful. The manager came round about 10 minutes after I'd ordered and slammed a creamy mushroom pasta in front of me (he really did slam it onto the table) and barked, \"your pasta.\" and walked off. I had to spend the next few minutes trying to catch the attention of one of the staff to tell them that this wasn't what I'd ordered. And then manager came, took it away, and only after I said, \"Erm, 'scuse me?\" did he turn around and say,. \"Oh, sorry.\" I was really annoyed because obviously his mistake has nothing to do with me. II hope it was just a bad day. The pasta, when the right one arrived, was pretty bland and hardly like how an Aglio Olio should be, although that's a mistake many Singaporean restaurants make. Disappointing, especially when I was looking forward to good service and got the exact opposite. From the manager! tsk.",
