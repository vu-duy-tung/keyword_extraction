    "text": "Decent Turkish place with good lunch sets. Personal go-to is the rice with grilled chicken - a simple dish but pretty comforting. The rice is buttered / well-seasoned and goes well with the tender chicken. Lunch set also comes with soup and dessert. Lunch set aside, we also like the hummus and baba ghanoush - both above average. Tried the baklava for desserts, which were way too sweet for our taste",

    "text": "Decent choice for lunch around the area, though slightly pricey, less authentic with small portions.This cafe caters to the Fusionopolis lunch crowd and is a welcome change from the usual food court offerings in the basement. They have a couple of doner wraps and kebab set meals that are value for money. The bread is fresh, and service is friendly. I particularly recommend the pide (turkish pizza-like dish).The mousakka was okay but a little too tomato-ish and the baklava was disappointing. The filo pastry wasn't crispy and it was extremely soggy. I was looking for a couple more exotic dishes and desserts like lahmacun, imam bayildi and kunefe but they weren't on the menu. A lot of the items were modified to cater to the Singaporean (and asian) palate. The turkish bread (ekmek) is strangely listed as \"pita\" under the menu for some reason. I don't claim to be Turkish food expert (lived with a couple of Turkish roommates and was educated on how to cook and eat the stuff) but I don't think the place is particularly authentic with the modified sauces and spices.Good to try, but looks like I'm heading to Arab Street.",

    "text": "My favorite dish here is the patlican salatasi, on the menu it's billed as \"Eggplant Salad\", which is necessary, I understand to make it easier to identify and order, but BORING!! \u00a0I'm a sucker for eggplant, aubergines or brinjals. \u00a0The very quality that puts most others off is I think the aubergine's most attractive quality, the viscid, almost mucoid quality of the juice and the flesh when stewed or boiled. \u00a0This very quality is exploited fully in dishes such as patlican salatasi and baba ghanoush which adds interesting textural notes and facilitates the amalgamation of acid, oil and heat. \u00a0This results in a dish that posseses a depth of flavor in excess of its simplicity. The salatasi is the Turkish version which mashes the eggplants rather than cutting them up as is done for baba ghanoush.I'm glad there's some place I can go and just sit down to a dish of salatasi without having to do it myself and end up with a serviceable but not very good version, and have to clean up after. \u00a0Yes, if you haven't yet gathered, I am pretty lazy.This is a very small casual cafe. \u00a0In Turkey, it might really be the hole in the wall that it is in Fusionopolis. \u00a0Casual, unpretentious and with food that doesn't aspire to more than to please and represent its origins, Arkadas is \"good peoples\" in my book.",

After all, there are hardly any restaurants at the top floor. Most food joints are on the ground floor. It has no big sign boards or anything. Just sitting humbling at a little corner, waiting to be discovered. Surprisingly there were quite a few people :) \u00a01. Chicken Doner Kebab - Good! The chicken was tender and juicy. I ordered mine without mayo and it tasted great :) My only concern would be that the serving size is too small for men. Price $8.90 (before tax). 2. Houmus with pita bread 3. Aubergine salad with pita bread - Learnt that Aubergine = Eggplant. While I am usually ok with eggplant. This version was super sour! It tasted like a pickle which I hate. Overall, a bit overpriced for the regular office crowd (especially for the their kebab's portion). Expect to spend $20/pax.",

    "text": "Hummus ($7.90 or so?) was recommended by a foodie friend! It was pretty good, not that much oil, rather substantially composed of chickpeas (i.e. pretty thick). The bread was also delicious.. I think it's Turkish bread (raised) rather than pita (flat). Anyway, crisp on the outside and soft (ish) on the inside! Just hot out from the oven :)Eggplant salad ($6.90 or so?) was a bit lacklustre, no char grill :( Sad. I actually liked the coolness of it, and the slight tang though! Went very well with the warm bread :)We also had cream of asparagus soup ($5). It was fine, nothing to shout about. Tasted somewhat like cream of mushroom plus some asparagus thrown in. Tender and well cooked asparagus though!Our friends ordered musakka (minced beef w green peppers n tomatoes, and lots of cheese) and izgara kofte (minced lamb beef patties). They were fairly pleased with the former but not so much the latter. Girl found it a little spicy while guy found it a bit dry. My bf liked the kofte though, finished what they couldn't!Our chicken shish kebab was pretty good, tender. 5 pieces on the skewer. Does NOT come with grilled veggies (or asparagus stalk) like it looks like on the website though.. Ah well. Butter rice was pretty good!Choc mousse ($4) had been highly recommended too, it was very very thick as well. Choc shavings on the top, yum! Baklava ($6 or so?) came as three small squares. It was seriously a sugar overload.. Or perhaps honey overload. Instant diabetes!!! Overly sweet/sugary, unfortunately.",

Arkadas Caf\u00e9 sells authentic Turkish food. There's the hummus and a variety of kebabs. My favourite main course is the salmon cheese which is perfectly baked with a thick layer of cheese sauce with asparagus by the side. The salmon is fresh and you can see the layers of the reddish meat separately as you slice into the fish.They serve free iced water too, always a plus point in my opinion.Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews.",

The lamb kebab in particular used excellent quality ingredients and was grilled just right. Wifey ordered the chicken doner kebab and a side of hummus. Hummus was decent but the doner had fried instead of grilled chicken, which resulted in some disapproving clucks.As other reviewers have pointed out, the prices are high for the quantity of food served. Other than that, no complaints.Once again, service gets two thumbs up.",

I remember a slight floury after-texture, but nothing off-putting.a tiny, unpretentious, but immensely likable caf\u00e9 - and gratifyingly close to the gastronomic wasteland of my workplace. I see repeat visits in my gastronomic crystal ball.",
