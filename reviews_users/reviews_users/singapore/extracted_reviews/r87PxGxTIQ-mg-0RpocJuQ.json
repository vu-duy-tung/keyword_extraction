    "text": "Sitting in the restaurant right now. It is past the lunch rush and there is one more customer in the restaurant. Still we have been waiting for 45 min for two wraps. Not anything fancy or complicated, just two simple wraps and we still have not recieved our food. As I'm writing this now, the food just arrived. After tasting it I feel really cheated! First of all, i had asked for extra pickle in my wrap. What I got was a total of two tiny pieces of pickle in the whole wrap. The flavour is mediocre at best, nothing special about it at all. And for the price of $15.50+tax I feel this place is a real rip off! The reviews at Yelp and Google had given this restaurant high rating, which is why we decided to go in in the first place. I truly regret that now. Do not come here! There are way better and cheaper places with better customer service! The only reason Byblos Grill gets a one star rating is because I am not able to give it zero stars. It really is that bad.",

The baba ganoush was, quite frankly, gross but the lamb was flavorful. Nothing can make up for the absolutely atrocious service though. It really should not have to take 45 minutes to get a bill, for example. Nor should the main courses arrive 30 minutes apart.",

Only complaint is the service is a little slow and the waiters, though friendly, don't seem to be able to speak any English.",
