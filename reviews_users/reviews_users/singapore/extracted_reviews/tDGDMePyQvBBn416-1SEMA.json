    "text": "This is my first time at white rabbit. Heard allot about it and wanted to give it a try. We had the 4 course dinner. The location is great. At a chapel. Lighting and stain glass made this a very pretty restaurant. Unfortunately the chapel was also an echo chamber, so it was a very noisy environment and frankly spoilt the ambience. Not a great place for an intimate evening. They should install sound dampeners to sort it out. Service was attentive and very good. The food was also excellent. Taste and presentation was all superb. The goose liver came with apple, apple sauce, micro greens and a rich balsamic vinegar. Perfectly balanced to the rich liver. For mains we had the beef short rib that had been slow cooked for 36 hours. Fork tender and incredible flavor. A really good dish. \u00a0Mother had the Dover sole. A decent choice, but it came slightly overcooked. Dessert was a deconstructed cheesecake and crepe Suzette. The cheesecake was unusual. Not your typical heavy cake. The cheese was whipped and therefore very light. It came with a raspberry ice cream which went very well. The crepe Suzette was also good, though it was a tad thick and as such had insufficient sauce. Nonetheless it was decent. Overall a very nice dinner. Cost wise, pricy but worth it. Recommended.",

I hear that if you come here during sunset it's even more gorgeous, as the sun sets and its fading rays shine through the stained glass windows.",

    "text": "Why did I even bother to book this restaurant in the first place? Cuz they've got some good reviews. I decided to give it a shot. And I'm writing for their service, not the food. Don't get me wrong, the food may be awesome(according to some) but their service needs a lot of help. If you think they deserve 5 stars, you might want to think again. Inconsistency in service does not warrant those \u00a05 stars. Save it for some other restaurant that deserves it. Here's my experience at The White Rabbit:I made a reservation for 2 at 9pm on 12th February. Arrived earlier than my reservation time and was told to wait a while for my table to be ready. An hour plus later and even asking about the table (was told to wait another 5 minutes), I wasn't even approached once by the service staff to inform me that there was a delay. The service was really bad. Not only didn't I get my table, I also had not received any calls to inform or ask me whether was I coming. If they're not interested then this isn't worth anyone's time. \u00a0By the way, I made the reservation a week prior to this date, and yet the booking was messed up. I would have appreciate it if someone had bothered to explain why was our table was delayed and served us asap, but none of that happened, I wasn't even stopped when I walked out of the doors. So much for service. Why do you even take reservations in the first place?It was already around 10ish when I left to look for another dinner place. My dinner mood was ruined by the staff at The White Rabbit and being hungry made nothing better. Zero stars if I could. 1 star for the so-so mocktail I had while waiting and the fact that I couldn't rate any lower. Count your blessings, rabbit.",

Parking is free and what better way to beat the crowd and enjoy a nice little lunch before heading back into the cubicle for another couple more hours of soul-draining work! The lunch sets on offer are decently priced and taste pretty good as well, a very good value for money combo. What's more service is very efficient and the fact that many haven't thought of the White Rabbit as a place for lunch makes it more attractive (to me at least).",

    "text": "*This review is purely on a Halloween Party held at the restaurant's outdoor bar area and the restaurant's weekend brunch menu.*I was club-hopping on my Halloween night-out ... and found my way to The White Rabbit. It was holding its annual Halloween party, with this year's theme being The Superstition Ball. Seriously, this place is so mad awesome. The whole place is divided into an indoor restaurant (which is more relevant to the second part of this review on its brunch) and an outdoor area. The outdoor area called the Rabbit Hole has a sheltered portion with a full bar and a garden area reminiscent of a cloister. Splendid architectural concept for people to weave seamlessly between the dance floor to groove to the DJ music and the 'cloister' for a cozy chat. Drinks are on a slightly pricey end (I think I paid $21 for my raspberry mojito which was not alcoholic enough ...). But the music was so good - don't expect Top40 hits here ... but an upbeat electrifying remix of hip-hop/classics/cheese/trance. I would definitely be back here for more of its theme parties or even on a usual night-out!So on its brunch menu! Where should I start? The restaurant is a remodeled chapel and with its Victorian-style furniture, its timeless elegance could not be more accentuated. The early afternoon sunlight filtered into the restaurant through the stained glass, suffusing the place with a romantic atmosphere.All the servers were clad in smart white uniform (think the white rabbit from Alice in Wonderland) - and the service was impeccable, besides a slight slip - one of the servers accidentally served us the wrong dish ... but she was quick to realise so (oh well ... but the dish she brought up to us was so obviously waffles not brioche french toast, as introduced by her). Water was refilled very promptly and the manager checked on us to make sure that everything was good.The food - oh man, where should I start again? A White Rabbit's brunch regular brought me here and according to him, the restaurant's signature brunch dishes were the Eggs Benedict and Brioche French Toast. We got a serving of Eggs Benedict each and split the French Toast (the only way to resolve the savoury-or-sweet-brunch-contention).Eggs Benedict with salmon: The poached eggs could be more runny, to create a more volcanic effect upon rupture. Otherwise, the hollandaise sauce was quite good with an adequate zesty punch! The smoked salmon was fresh. The English muffin was nicely toasted, moist in the inside and packed by a crunchy exterior. I am a massive Eggs Benedict fan (having tried tonnes of them in Europe and the States) ... this is premium Eggs Benedict I would say. The side salad (fresh greens tossed in Balsamic Vinegar) was so good as well ... a perfect light complement to the more flavourful Eggs Benedict.Brioche French Toast: The mango bits on top of the French toast were some pockets of bomb! Sweet, but not sickly sweet - that's the WHOLE point of having FRUITS on french toast - they have to be sweet (not sour), but not overly sweet to steal the show from the french toast. Peanut butter and jam were sandwiched within the pleasantly caramelised brioche ... and with the maple syrup (above average, but not so much of a bomb) drizzled over the toast ... I was sent to cloud nine.I enjoyed my brunch experience here tremendously - I am so sure that I would be back here again!Also, for the non-drivers and anti-cabbing peeps, there is a cobbled path, cutting across the grass field (across the road from the restaurant), which is a short-cut to the nearest bus stop (quite a few buses come here). Dempsey Hill is so not that inaccessible after all.I am now a massive White Rabbit fan. *Hops*",

    "text": "Located in Demsey is the White Rabbit. It has a rather decent sized parking lot which is free of charge for customers. The White Rabbit is more of an upscale fine dining place you would take someone to celebrate a special meal with. It is also a beautifully restored 1930s Ebenezer chapel!The White Rabbit resides in a restored old chapel along the stretch of Dempsey Hill. The historical establishment itself is very captivating in creating a unique 'Alice in Wonderland' concept of The White Rabbit, attempting to bring you to another world. There's a very cute outdoor dining area lined with lounge chairs. The staff explained that they were setting up a wedding the next door. I can definitely see this place being used for weddings. I am glad that they managed to preserve the stained glass from when this was a place of worship. The atmosphere in the chapel was peaceful and romantic with ceiling lights as well very powerful air conditioning systems. So much so, that they staff offered us ladies, scarves or even warm water instead of cold water.1. Truffle Mac and Cheese with mushrooms $16++Though this is an appetizer portion. It had alot of mac and cheese and thus, became very filling quickly. The amount of truffle added to the mac and cheese was very significant and you could smell and taste it. They were generous with the mushrooms as well! The texture of the cheese was warm enough to enjoy and yet stick all the macaroni together.There was also bread service. I picked tomato basil bread, and since the bread is all freshly baked in house. The bread was piping hot and extremely crisp to begin with. The provided butter melted immediately once I applied it into the bread. 2. Deconstructed Cheese Cake $18++This was an interesting dessert. The wait staff asked me to mix up everything on the plate as there was graham crumble, blueberry sorbet and pop rocks all layered one on top of the other. The cream cheese wasn't too sweet or sour. The pop rock popped in your mouth in every mouthful. It was definitely a surprise for me. I enjoyed that the graham crackers were crumbles instead of a hard crust, that you would find in any typical cheesecake. This way, you could enjoy the graham crackers bit by bit.3. Chocolate Fondant $16++The chocolate fondant consisted of a caramel core lava cake with fruits and banana and rum ice cream. The lava cake wasn't moist on the exterior, but rather it was bread crust like. On the inside, was a small pocket of caramel that flowed out like liquid gold! The banana and rum ice cream was full of creamy goodness. I guess to compliment all the sweet stuff, all the fruits provided were sour?All in all, a very beautiful place to spend time with your loved ones. The food and the ambience are both top notch!",

When they offered us complementary bread they even came back to ask if we wanted seconds.I really liked their TOMATO BASIL BREAD which was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. The bits of tomato and basil reminded me of pizza bread. Food: TRUFFLED MAC & CHEESE WITH MUSHROOM - highly recommend**We asked for it to be served as a starter and it was delicious!! Probably my favorite dish of the night.ALASKAN KING CRAB TAGLIATELLE - I ordered the appetizer size and the portion was pretty filling. I thought the dish itself was satisfactory. I liked how the sauce was light and the bits of crab made the dish more flavorful. Personally, I would have wanted more bits of crab but it probably wasn't as much since I ordered the appetizer portion. The pasta was also a little harder than I would have personally liked. MUSHROOM RAVIOLI -I didn't try it but my friend said she enjoyed it!Decor:It's understandable as to why so many people compliment this restaurant. The interior decor is breathtaking!! The abundance of candles and dim lighting makes for a very romantic atmosphere. The bar which is located outside on the patio (the rabbit hole) is also thoughtfully furnished. It's a very cute area. At night, they light up their walkway leading to the bar which adds to the whole romantic vibe. \u00a0Plus it's also perfect for taking photos.",

I have yet to be disappointed by the food, but I especially enjoy the roasted black truffle chicken (come early, the supply does run out) and the truffle mac and cheese. Definitely order the crepes suzette for a table-side preparation. The drinks are also delicious and should be popular for gin lovers, given the relationship The Rabbit Hole. Aside from the the food, the service consistently been wonderful!",

The stained coloured glass is always nice to stare at if you would like to avoid some conversation with whoever you are having a meal with. HahahaThe appetizer was nothing to shout out about as I had a salad printemps and a few of the rest had the salad nicoise. I had the pork collar, which I think was quite a fatty piece of meat. I wouldn't recommend this to any of my girlfriends seriously. A few of us had the seabass that came in a pot and wrapped in plastic bag, which was interesting. I think they also say that the seabass taste good.The side dishes we have ordered, apart from the set lunch were good, especially the truffled mac and cheese. The portion was really tiny. A portion could serve 3 people, I believe. \u00a0We also ordered grilled asparagus and fries which were average in my opinion. It is definitely a lovely ambience for a date night or even just a girls' night out sort of place.",

It's just a pen dude, come on. Even if I were to take it, what's the big deal? I wouldn't. It's just a pen. 5 stars - the venue really is amazing. It's just a shame the service can't live up to the food and venue. I really wouldn't mind paying more for food if the service was superb. I think that's one thing Singapore needs to work on, the customer service. For some reason, they're a little Chinese in the service sense where they won't take the time to make sure the customer is satisfied. They just get things done and that's it k thanks bye. No thank you.",

I chose the two course option. I started with the scallops. The scallops were absolute perfection. They were in a delicious sauce that was thick and rich. I should have ordered two orders of scallops and that probably would have been a perfect meal. I selected the pork belly as my main course. I was rather disappointed in it. It was fairly flavourless and way too fatty. The White Rabbit staff was attentive and kind. We had a large group and they did everything they could to accommodate us comfortably. I am not sure whether or not I will be back. I don't feel like anything was amazing enough to draw me back. However, if you are in Singapore, I do recommend trying it, if nothing else for the lovely setting.",

I particularly enjoyed the latter - smoked salmon can so often be more salt than flavor, but not here. it was served a sizeable portion, with a heartiness I normally only associate with hot-smoked salmon (which I love, incidentally).the steak with eggs was pretty good too, with our beef done perfectly medium rare and pink and topped with two perfectly done sunny-side-ups.but if you're in the mood for something heartier, they also have a more lunch-type section with things like a proper beef burger (slightly over-minced (which leads to a mushier, less chunky patty, though still acceptable) and a salad nicoise with not-too-salty anchovies and colourful salad leaves.mind you, I say heartier in the sense of flavor rather than any indication of size. the portions here vary from small to reasonable, so don't be expecting anything remotely close to belly-busting.we finished with the waffles, since their rather famous white chocolate souffle wasn't available - this is possibly the only dish I'd steer clear of, seeing as how it was both anemic and biscuit-like (these really should be contrary adjectives, seeing how the first indicates lack of cooking, and the latter indicates rather too much). the only saving grace were the tart berries and ice cream. go for the affogato instead, which has a scoop of great ice cream over a satisfyingly bitter shot of espresso.service is pretty hit-and-miss. we waited a goodly amount of time for our food to arrive, so the portions did seem paltry at arrival - but it's otherwise friendly when you can get it. prices are commensurate with the venue rather than dish size, and so don't expect anything cheap - but come at least to see the place, and bask in the whole posh brunchness of the place.",

It was resplendent with the setting sun shining lazily through the stained glass windows.

The hot orange smell is delectable, and the final orangey-Marnier sauce goes with everything. Waffles are good and crispy too if a little dry as there's not enough syrup.Beware of mosquitoes though, I got bites just walking over from my car!",
