    "text": "Recently the place started to have lunch service. To promote its lunch during its first week till 22 May 2016, it was offering burgers at $7 each during lunch times (including the weekends). It was great deal considering that the burgers cost between $18 to $24 each. The place was packed with mostly families during the Sunday lunch time. It looked kind of colorful and bright, instead of the usual dark and loud place it usually was at night. Remember to help yourself to the condiments such as mustard and Tomato Ketchup, as well as, the kitchen towel on the table.Red Chili Burger ($24)Beef patty, beef chili, cheese, jalapenos, French's mustardIt looks kind of dry when served. I wish it was served with dripping chili. Kind of disappointing.Buffalo Chicken Burger ($20)Fried chicken fillet slathered in house-made hot pepper sauce, lettuce, red onions, blue cheese sauceIt looked super spicy, overflowing with red sauce. It was sinfully juicy and greasy. We had Hard Shakes to go with the burgers.Chendol Shake ($18)Abuelo Anejo Rum, Coconut Cream, maple, vanilla ice creamPandan flavoured and milky with alcoholic aftertaste, although I wish there was some green chendol jelly in it too.Salted Caramel & Bourbon ($18)Bourbon, sea salt, caramel, vanilla creamThick creamy milkshake with alcoholic aftertaste, but a bit difficult to drink with the thin straw.Overall the food and drinks were filling, even although the burgers looked kind of smaller this time.",

    "text": "No doubt about it: looks-wise, this place is hot shit. I think it sets itself apart from a lot of other places in the area because it's dark and edgy (but not dingy.) There's really cool art on the walls, and the lit up letters spelling \"Singapore\" across the bar and kitchen are pretty effing cool.Food-wise, I thought it was okay. I had the dead hippie burger, which was made up of 2 mustard flavoured patties. Honestly, the mustard wasn't very strong. I also tried the cheese fries, which were not covered in cheddar like I expected. I didn't read the menu so I'm unsure what cheese they used, but it was a white cheese that didn't melt very well so there would be chunks of cheese here and there and lots of uncovered fries.They do have a strong drinks menu, though. Cocktails take up almost an entire page, and my boss, who knows her beer, recognised a lot that was on the beer list.Music was very loud, so be prepared to raise your voice over songs like Peaches' \"F*ck The Pain Away\". If you know this song, I'd say it pretty much sums up the attitude of this place.The food isn't mind blowing, but it's definitely a cool place to be seen. If you don't mind shelling out a few dolla dolla billz to be in a cool spot, then go for it. Just know that they only take reservations for 10 people or more!",

    "text": "For something that's lauded as a popular burger joint from London, i have to say i've never heard of it and i've been to London twice. Granted one does not exactly look for a burger when one visits the city, does one?Anyways...Get the dead hippie burger. The sauce is to die for (heh heh). It says 2x the patty, but even though you do get two patties i think the overall volume of beef is still the same as other burgers. Maybe the double patty is to serve as more surface area for the sauce? Whatever it is... It works for me. So, some may disagree with me and some may even consider this comparison to the God of american burgers to be blasphemous, but this burger reeeerally reminds me of a cleaner version of In-n-out animal style (I KNOW RIGHT?). At least, this is the closest i've gotten to that taste since I moved away from socal.We also got the chili cheese fries to share. Which can easily feed three people. The chili was a bit dry but definitely packs a punch in flavor. It was pretty spicy even for my standard (i love spicy) but not unbearable.Huge bonus for them: protein style (replace bun with lettuce) is available right off the menu. I miss being able to order this without having to specifically ask for it and getting odd looks from the server...Another draw of the place is its decor and ambience. Definitely fitting to be the new resident of Duxton Hill.",

Prices are high for burgers, but in the stylish environs, perhaps fitting...Burgers are well built and tasty and the onion rings are sized more appropriately for the Indomitous Rex than the humble Homo Sapien... Not that I'm complaining, they are thrillingly large and wonderfully crispy!Drink list is thoughtful and fun, but definitely priced in line with an upscale cocktail bar...

My freind arrived before I did and asked to be put on the waiting list, but said I had to show up as well, to be placed on the list. Ok, she was now pissed off. Then we were asked to wait for about 20minutes for a table. We got one 15 minutes after. Yippeeeeee!!!The food was basic. Shrimp covered in batter, with 'cajun' spices, (I need to bring my bottle of spice the next time I go there), buffalo wings, and double patty burger, paleo style. Sauce? What sauce?I think the beef patty was the same quality to Potato Head. Which is why I stopped going there ages ago.Including a beer, the total bill was $84!Eeeeks!The place reeked of a cheesy, american diner, with owners who have a lot of creativity, and no art gallery to put it in.Even more eeeeeeks!The music was blaring loud. Rock, I think that noise was, and the tables were tightly spaced together. On the plus side, the servers were super attentive and detailed in order taking. Yes, that matters. I still consume no dairy, so, I asked for no cheese, and no bread. They gave me a huge piece of lettuce, and delivered my order correctly.Please. Don't waste your time and money.",
