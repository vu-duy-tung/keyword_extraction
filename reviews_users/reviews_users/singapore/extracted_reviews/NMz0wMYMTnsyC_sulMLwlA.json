    "text": "If Bruno's is busy, Trattoria L'Operetta is a great alternative!You can get both pizzas and pastas here. They have a wood fire oven, so expect some great pies. During my last visit I went the pasta route and ordered their Tagliatelle Bolognese, an all-time favourite dish of mine. The pasta was al dente and the meat sauce was to die for. Portion-wise it's on the lighter end, so if you have an appetite I recommend getting an appetizer as well.I ordered their bruschetta, which turned out a-ok. I liked the charred bread, though the tomato mixture could've been a bit more flavourful with more basil and better quality tomatoes. Still, a great app for starters.Add in the cosy ambiance, friendly service, and complimentary bread/olive oil (which is not always a given in Singapore) I give this trattoria a solid 4 stars!",

The food remains sub par - they had a fantastic product and now it's just not there. The uni pasta was ok but it used to be off the chart. I had the ribeye, and it really seemed to have been recently thawed out. I think the price was 38 - a lot of food came with the steak, but the cut of meat was a bit chewy. It was cooked perfectly, though. Again, a strange miss.",

The food's legit, they came out fast yet well prepared and taste delicious. It's one of them places which can be great for a casual date night, a family outing or when you want to just be alone and read a book while savoring what feels like home made Italian cooking. Yeap. It's a restaurant that allows for many sub-plots to coexist within the same space. That's what it is.",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner date at Trattoria L'Operetta.I will start by saying this was a very disappointing dining experience.The service was simply abysmal. \u00a0The servers were not engaged. \u00a0The servers were not attentive or informative. \u00a0Our orders were taken in a reasonable amount of time. \u00a0But, even this, and bringing the wine list had some amount of delay. \u00a0The appetizers came out in relatively short order. \u00a0The main courses though were very delayed (around an hour). \u00a0We asked multiple times. \u00a0 We were told they were being prepared. \u00a0During our time there, the restaurant only had one other patron. \u00a0He was only there for the first half of our meal.For much of the time, the servers simply stood around at their counter. \u00a0They did not check to see how the meal was progressing. \u00a0They did not smile. \u00a0They did not offer basic touches. \u00a0 \u00a0For instance, when our pizza and pasta came out, we were not offered black pepper or Parmesan. The staff in the kitchen seemed to be more interested in socializing with each other than preparing food.The ambiance was nice. \u00a0It had a rustic European charm. \u00a0It reminded me more of Austria or Germany than Italy though. \u00a0Plates and business boxes stacked on the counter detracted from the charm.tinyurl.com/k4kqpnaThe food ranged from poor to good.I will note that we usually share food (appetizers and mains) but, for some reason we did not. \u00a0She enjoyed her food more than I enjoyed mine. \u00a0Her food also looked more appetizing than mine.Fried Calamari - This dish was room temperature. \u00a0This is never a good sign for fried calamari. \u00a0It was very bland. \u00a0The calamari was rubbery. \u00a0The dipping sauce made it edible and I completed about 3/4 of the dish.tinyurl.com/n8yrl3dPrawns with potatoes - This was my dinner companion's appetizer. \u00a0While she rave about it, she did enjoy it and ate it all.tinyurl.com/kwu9kvzPizza Margherita - This was my main course. \u00a0The taste of the sauce was bright. \u00a0Unfortunately, the basil was added too early in the cooking process. \u00a0The pizza dough lacked any structure. \u00a0The cheese didn't really have a presence in the flavour profile. \u00a0It ended up being rather bland and floppy. \u00a0 I ate half of it and left the rest. \u00a0This was certainly not the worst pizza I've ever eaten but it is far, far far, away from the best. \u00a0 The Pizza Margherita at their sister restaurant, Enoteca L'Operetta , was much better.tinyurl.com/ltammeaLinguine Granchio (linguine with crab) - My friend truly enjoyed this dish. \u00a0She ate half and took the remaining half home. \u00a0It was an appetizing looking dish. tinyurl.com/k2wp8mjReceipt (Dinner for 2): $250.70Overall - Once again, this was a very disappointing dining experience. \u00a0To be honest, with a more engaging and attentive staff, I would perceive it very differently. \u00a0I really do believe that the service was the difference between a poor experience and a relatively average one. \u00a0The room was very comfortable with a touch of charm. \u00a0I would not consider returning to Trattoria \u00a0L'Operetta.",

    "text": "BEST PIZZA IN SINGAPORE!!!!! (of the places I've tried)As far as I know this is the only Verace approved pizzeria in Singapore, which means their ingredients adhere to the strict standards of the pizza regulating organization in Napoli, Italy, which is the birthplace and mecca of pizza (pizzanapoletana.org). On principle, one would thus have to expect this is the best pizzeria in Singapore. Our meal tonight lived up to expectations.Every dish, not just the pizza, seemed to be prepared meticulously. It was delicious. Everything. My girlfriend \"liked that shit\". We had the prosciutto rucola pizza with tomato sauce and a diavola, caponata, tiramisu, and pesca composta col gelato. I am so glad this is here.As someone who goes back to Italy every chance I can get and tends to be somewhere between underwhelmed (Da Paolo) and appalled (Pastamania) by the Italian culinary options in Singapore, this was impressive. A very pleasant surprise.",

    "text": "Here's my rule of thumb, anything with an egg is good, and pizza is no exception. We had the Bismark pizza, which had ham, mushroom, tomato and egg. The highlight of the pizza itself was the dough, which had great flavor and was soft yet had a nice crispy crust. Add in mushroom and egg, which are two of my favorite ingredients on pizza, and you're definitely in business. The quality of the ingredients themselves was only average, but overall it is definitely one of the better pizzas I've had in Sg so far. I will definitely be back here if I am having a pizza craving.",
