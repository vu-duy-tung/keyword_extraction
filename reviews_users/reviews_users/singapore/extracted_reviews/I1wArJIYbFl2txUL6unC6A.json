    "text": "My order of Scrambled Eggs with Rocket, Tomatoes, Za'atar Bread and Thick-cut Maple-glazed Bacon Chop ($20++) was delish. The scrambled eggs at Artichoke are one of the best I have had anywhere, with a creamy smooth yet fluffy texture and seasoned to perfection. They go immensely well with the Roasted Corn and Cherry Tomatoes and complemented the sweet yet savoury Maple-glazed Bacon Chop which is a popular order given that unlike normal, paper-thin bacon, the one served at Artichoke is about 2 cm thick and incredibly sinful-good. Za'atar bread however was overly hard and difficult to enjoy. As good as the scrambled eggs were, the Lamb Shakshouka ($25++) stole the show. Consisting of Eggs in a Skillet w Tomato Sauce, Roast Lamb Shoulder, Kashkaval Cheese, Pistachio Dukka & Za'atar Bread, the Mediterranean brunch item is a refreshing change from the usual eggs and bacon and I am utterly sold by the savoury, mildly spicy dish. Of course, the lamb was cooked till it breaks easily and the sauce was appetizing though the huge portion meant it was difficult to finish unless you have friends to help you along (which I am sure they would gladly do (like I did).For pictures and the full review visit voraciousappetite.wordpr\u2026",

    "text": "This is one of the best places for brunch. In fact it might be my top recommended place for it because of how unique it is. Instead of your usual indie cafe that sells poached eggs drenched in hollandaise sauce and some salads for $18 bucks, Artichoke has more of an Egyptian or middle eastern influences to their cuisine. It shows in their brunch sets too, with the use of feta cheese and hummus etc.My favorite is actually a very simple dish - the scrambled eggs with rocket, feta cheese, and organic mushrooms. Those mushrooms! If this is what organic tastes like I won't mind having all my food be organic. It's really delicious.For the more carnivorous humans, they also have the same combi expect with mushrooms replaced with a bacon chop. When they say bacon chop, don't think of thin strips but a slab of three-layered pork. Very intimidating looking but also delicious and satisfying!Do remember to check the opening times for the place. It fills up really fast so be sure to make an reservation at least 3 days in advance.",

Our waiter waited a good 30 minutes after seating us to take our drink orders. We finally ordered the lamb and chicken entrees, as well as the broccoli, brussel sprouts, hummus, egg plant, and beets appetizers to share, with three orders of pita bread. They completed botched our order- three of the dishes were wrong, and when we asked for the correct dishes, it took an additional 45 minutes to get the proper dishes delivered. By that point, everything was cold, and the serving sizes were tiny- definitely not enough to share. So we ended up having to order more. The staff was totally unapologetic about the incorrect order, and had the audacity to ask us to hurry up eating (after they were the reason it took so long), because they wanted our table for later reservations. Regardless of how good the food is, we will not be coming back, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "Recommend for brunch, do not recommend for dinner, so A-OK in my book. Brunch:-Lamb Shakshouka was amazing. Not at all a healthy choice, but very very good (and it wouldn't be a stretch to say all my friends had serious food envy as soon as the dish arrived).-Mezza platter looked good - your standard mezza platter.-Scrambled eggs looked pretty good as well...but with all the bacon / pork belly on the side the plate was very very greasy / oily and it was rather off-putting for me.. Though I'm sure for some the generous portion of bacon would be a plus!-Our \"appetizers\" of haloumi and hummus didn't come until after all of our entrees, but aside from the poor timing they were enjoyable.-Friend had the banana muffin from the dessert window and thoroughly enjoyed it.-When we arrived without a reservation at 11am on Sunday I was told it would be a 1+ hour wait, and that reservations are usually full for brunch by the Wednesday before the weekend. Luckily we were seated after waiting only about 15 minutes, but I would recommend making a rez if you can plan that far in advance!Dinner:After a delicious brunch at Artichoke my friends and I were excited to come back for dinner and to try the desserts. Unfortunately we were rather underwhelmed by the dinner options. -The dinner menu consisted of a number of dished which I would refer to as \"dips\" or \"sides\" - but not actual dinners. Granted there are a couple full dinner options - maybe 4? Mostly hearty-sounding meat dishes. But there was a serious lack of selection in my opinion. What about my vegetarian friends? Hummus for dinner? There wasn't even a salad on the menu!-My friend and I ordered hummus, the red pepper dip and the grilled cauliflower (the latter it appears was forgotten about as it never came). The two dips, a few drinks, and dessert were enough to fill us up. -Hummus was good - we ordered it again after enjoying it at brunch.-Red pepper dip was weird. It was topped with pomegranate seeds (which were not listed on the menu as part of the dish) and they were really overpowering. Made the dip too sweet, in my opinion.-I had sticky date pudding for dessert. Not what I was expecting - the pudding was topped with what I can only describe as date-flavored jello. I scraped these off and focused on the cake-y part of the dish, and the vanilla sauce. \u00a0This was good, but the jello-like topping was weird and I did not enjoy it. -We arrived around 8:45 on Friday evening and were told (despite the more-than-half-empty status of the restaurant) that they were fully booked. Luckily the nice folks at Artichoke were willing to serve my friend and I drinks at one of the side tables (meant to be just for waiting, but not technically part of the restaurant), and then they were able to give us a table for dinner after about 15-20 minutes.Note:-Not sure about the reservation system as when I walked in the wait times I was quoted ended up being rather exaggerated. If you can make a reservation I would suggest it, but if you forgot I would say try your luck walking in.-Dips do not come with bread, you have to pay extra to have something to \"dip\" in your hummus/etc-Service is slow, but always very nice and friendly.-You get a tiny packet of gummy candies as a \"goodbye\" when you leave. So sweet! And yum!",

Plus my friends are greedy. We usually pop in at very strange hours. Like 10pm and zoom in to the dessert menu. So far, we've had all three desserts - cookie pie, sticky date pudding, and that milk pudding with rose and strawberry thing that tastes just like bandung. My favorite so far has got to be the sticky date. Coffee wise, the iced mocha is waaaaay too sweet. And why are they charging 50cents more just for it to be iced?Like I said, don't get me wrong. I really enjoy my Artichoke visits. And I love the snarky website. And how the chairs are so thoughtfully placed - three white, one black. Three white, one black. Then three black, one white. And the little baggies of sour gums on the way out. It's a fun, albeit expensive place to hang out at.",

I loved it's convenient location in the city, and near the Bras Basah MRT, yet it is somehow quietly tucked away in a corner complete with a lovely cobblestoned courtyard, bamboo plants and dim lighting.The service there is excellent - the staff are attentive and a chatty manager checked in on my table to see if you are enjoying the food. He was also helpful in recommending dishes and wines or drinks that go with the food. This is one of the best restaurants in Singapore for Moorish food. The dinners here are more social as we all ordered dishes to share, rather than a main each. Expect very different flavours from what you are used to. The lamb here is incredibly tender, and does not have a strong gamey smell or taste. Even people who do not usually eat lamb found it very good here!My favourite exotic dish was the Forgotten Grain Salad - finally something healthy that isn't all green and tastes great! The slow roasted pork belly had incredibly crispy crackling and the meat melted in my mouth. We also ordered the organic mushrooms that had been grown on a local farm. Artichoke currently has a project to grow their own herbs and vegetables - which I think is just incredible!The desserts there are made by them as well, and I have to say, they really take the cake. The salted caramel sticky date pudding was my absolute favourite. It came in a generous portion as well. We also had the basil cheescake with fresh watermelon balls... and the flavours were divine. I could not believe how great the combination was!We really enjoyed all the amazing dishes, and I'm looking forward to trying their brunch menu soon! Their menu does change fairly often, so drop in and try those delectable dishes before they're off the menu!",

And what better way to recover from a hangover than sangria at 11am?It was with this thought in mind that I made my way to Artichoke Cafe & Bar on a Tuesday for some breakfast and good company.With no reservation, we were forced to sit outside, although we were lucky that it was a relatively cool day in Singapore. Tucked away in the courtyard behind two buildings, we were suddenly transported away from present-day Singapore to colonial Singapore. The wicker chairs, the red-painted outer wall of the cafe, the white-paneled windows and doors... the place had its charms, no doubt. But would it live up to its potential?Artichoke's brunch menu is relatively simple, although I could see the ingredients were high quality and a lot of thought had been put into piecing together the items on the menu. The quality menu was lost on its servers though, who were clueless as to what the menu contained, what the ingredients were, and what they themselves were doing there. Needless to say, service was slow and confusing, but it was hard to be mad at the servers who were so utterly clueless. It would be like scolding newborns!I started off with a sangria to put me in the mood for a slow day. Instead, I was jolted awake by how absolutely awful the sangria tasted. It seemed like their idea of sangria was citrus soda with white wine. A place like this couldn't afford to cut up some real fruits for a sangria? Sangria is such a straight-forward drink, how could they screw that up? I wasn't feeling the love. What they gave me was barely drinkable, so I let it sit and watched the condensation slide down the glass as we waited for our food.I opted for the scrambled eggs and bacon chop, which turned out to be a good decision. The maple-glazed bacon chop was thick and meaty, with just enough fat to be tender and fragrant. The scrambled eggs were on the runny side, purposefully so.I also tried my friend's hash browns, which were crisp and delicious (and oily, as hash browns go). Originally, I asked for ketchup to go with the eggs and hash browns, but they said the kitchen didn't have any. A brunch place that does not have any ketchup? Just as I was working myself into a huff, I asked if they had maple syrup and, lo and behold, they did! The tension was quickly diffused as I embraced my Canadianism and poured a generous portion of maple syrup over everything on my plate.While the food turned out to be good, the service was in a constant state of hopeless confusion, and the sangria was an unmistakable failure. I would probably not return unless a friend of mine decided to host a meal here, and even then it would only be for the ambiance.",

    "text": "I know I should have written one right from the start when Yelp became an SG phenomenon. I held back because I know the menu I had relished isn't quite the same and reviewing it before I went back for its main stays right now would be a waste of time to read. Well, since I have been teased aptly on this day for being the first ROTD (due to technical glitches previously that rigged this honour for me) here's my review of Artichoke that comes highly recommended.I am a middle eastern somewhere in my gut/belly. And artichoke has always satisfied and put me into a medi- mood for weeks after I dine there. They did it again with their awesome mezzes on the menu for just $7/dish $20/ 3dishes . I have my Turkish haunts when I have that itch for endless eggplants, but talking about true comfort meeting epicurean, try this 'middle eatery/ modern eastern' establishment. Great food prep, principles, and ethical food business and practices I very proudly would pay to dine. Simply, they deserve it. So back to mezzes, I personally am head over heels over the babaganoush and the tarama. Bjorn, owner/chef, nailed the eggplant's savouriness with the smoky tender silky mouthfeel all in the babaganoush. The tarama-ish dip is not some caviar, but its pale creaminess that gives that slight fishy, (or as I would like to perceive as the goodness of the sea) is from smoked oyster! Honestly, balancing all those big flavours, with the right mouthfeel nailed it. I shamelessly used my finger and wiped the plate as I was speaking to some people I've just met for the first time of my life. Soooooooooo, I guess, Artichoke won?",

    "text": "Artichoke Cafe is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore because of its consistently good food. The food here is fresh and full of garlicky, olive-oil goodness. When we asked the waiter about the type of cuisine here, he stated that it consists of \"Syrian, Lebanese, Greek\" influences. \u00a0Basically, it is a Mediterranean medley and it is common for your table to share a few dishes. \u00a0Appetizers - The mezzo - fresh hummus, red pepper dip, pickled octopus, anchovies - are all fresh and very tasty here.Entrees - I've only eaten here for dinner and have also taken part in \"lambgasm\" (a 2.2 kg feast of lamb with sides). \u00a0While the lamb and beef are cooked well, I really like the vegetarian options here as well. The cauliflower and broccoli dishes are both caramelized to perfection and topped with some type of garlic/anchovy sauce. \u00a0It is salty, tangy, and completely delicious.Dessert - Mmm, sticky date pudding. \u00a0I haven't had any of the \"underdoughs\" desserts but the baklava and tarts at least look great!The inability to split bills is a little odd as was a call to alter a reservation once (it took 2 minutes for the waitress to understand I had an existing reservation and just wanted to move the time). \u00a0But the small packet of gummy worms at the end of every meal put me in a better mood.",

However the food was good (I wouldn't go so far as 'great') with plenty of choices and attentive service. A cafe cum restaurant with a tapas-mediterranean-meze-fusion style menu... I think Artichoke is having a bit of an identity crisis as I'm not sure what sort of brand it's going for (if it's going for one at all) I would suggest coming here with a group of friends. We ordered everything from salads, to breads, to meats to poultry, to dessert. I especially the flat breads and the quinoa rice salad. The mushies were also delish. Apparently the menu changes regularly and the owner/chef travels abroad once a year to get inspiration as well as contribute to the local community of wherever they are visiting. Along with 2-3 drinks each, we spent approx $75 pp. I don't remember any music playing while we were there... so I'd recommend some background sounds to add some ambience. The small paper bag of candy given to us on the way out was a nice treat. I'd be interested to see how brunch is... there's alfresco dining in the courtyard which is appealing. But in the meantime, a good spot for evening imbibing with friends.",

This type of service is hard to come by in Singapore! The atmosphere is casual, with a mix of table and chair styles, and a large chalk board directing you to the restroom. \u00a0This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Singapore!! \u00a0They essentially require you to have a reservation before dining with them, so definitely call ahead to reserve your space!",

The waitstaff was smart and friendly- very well-trained servers. The food was delicious, from the Meze Platter to the Lamb Shiska (sp) and my sis's Haloumi cheese salad. The date pudding was delicious too. Prices are very reasonable; brunch is only served on the weekends. We'll be back to check out dinner service!

Dinner should be fine though. \u00a0I was quite surprised by how big the space is inside. \u00a0I have passed by several times when I visited Objectifs next door and the restaurant space always looks a bit crammed so I assume it was mostly outdoors. \u00a0We were seated in an indoor patio area which has been converted into part of the indoor dining space with natural lighting seeping through the glass ceiling, perfect setting for sunday brunch! \u00a0I was delighted to find out that it's a middle eastern themed menu - definitely a welcoming change from the typical steak/eggs benedict) aplenty across the island. \u00a0It also reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants Ottolenghi in London. \u00a0The first thing that caught my eye on the brunch menu was the Cauliflower Sabbich, essentially a pita bread open sandwich topped with grilled/deep fried cauliflower, hummus, labneh and served with a smoked egg that resembles funnily enough a Chinese \"tea leaves smoked egg\". It's flavorful without being over seasoned, healthy but filling. \u00a0We also had the lamb shashouka, which is basically your normal shashouka with shreds of lamb in it. \u00a0Again, won't be complete without scooping chunks of it up with pieces of pita bread. \u00a0 The lemonade was a bit too sweet but otherwise a refreshing cooler in the heat of the Singapore afternoon. \u00a0Can't wait to check out their dinner options. \u00a0And if you are visiting the afternoon, do drop by at the Objectifs next door, they always have interesting exhibitions and will be a good place to stroll around and burn off some of that food.",

    "text": "A little something special.Artichoke is very special in my opinion, in terms of everything, from the food to the location and atmosphere.Thanks to my beautiful friend who arrived first, I didn't have to queue to get a table for a Saturday brunch. The entrance to this restaurant is a short alley amongst empty houses. It almost became a quaint place hidden in the middle of busy streets. We were seated outdoor in a lovely garden. Menu was quite interesting - it's probably because I'm not experienced with Middle Eastern food. We had 2 dishes to share and my apology for not having the exact name but they are: 1. a BIG pile of burrata on top of buttery bread - I'm biased from having Osteria Mozza the night before so this can not match up, but I would say it's not too bad 2. salmon pancake - which I thought was quite delicious, a good combination of sweetness from the pancakes and saltiness from the smoked salmon. Artichoke seemed to be very generous with its portion and the two of us were so stuffed after those 2 dishes :)We had a look at the Overdough bakery and everything looked so delicious. I will definitely come back to try some baked goods!",

    "text": "Since we moved to Singapore less than two months ago, we've eaten here three times already! Once for brunch, twice for dinner. The d\u00e9cor of this place is quite rustic, and it reminds me of some of the places we used to frequent in New York City where the chef cares very much about the food and nothing else. \u00a0 As for our first experience, we came late for brunch to avoid the crowd. Unfortunately, half of the dishes on the brunch menu were sold out by the time we got seated (around 2pm). Although I was dying for some fried chicken, the second best thing available on the menu - mushroom scrabbled egg - was just equally delicious. They do accept ressy for brunch so make sure you call to get a table.Personally I enjoyed our dinner even more so than brunch. The menu is bigger - about 10 mezzes and 10 entrees, plus some side dishes. The must haves - pumpkin and eggplant from the mezze, burrata and prawns from the entr\u00e9e. It's not a late night place as their last kitchen call comes before 9:30.",

    "text": "Okay at best, maybe even not that... This is one of those places that makes me think its reviews are all fake. All of the raves of this place must be fake or by people who have no idea what food should taste like. The food here is not \"all that\". Its really not. The reality is that this place has bland food that \"looks and sounds good\". First we ordered the hummus. They say they make it on site. I call BS on that. If they are making it they are doing it wrong. It tastes and looks store bought. Well, not even that good. All they do is put sprinkle some paprika and smoked salt on top of cheap hummus with cheap oil. Thats it, its bland, tasteless, and just boring. Next, we had the fried cauliflower, again boring and nothing special. It looks great but has no flavor. After that the fried chicken and beef ribs. They both sounded great on the menu with all the fancy spices but none of the flavors came through. With the chicken, all you can taste is the old cheap oil they use to fry it, the breading, and some sugar they use in the funky garlic sauce. The ribs were just sweet and tender. None of the flavors came out it was just soggy tender overly sweet meat. Finally we had the famous \"sticky date pudding\", this was just taking the piss. Its just watered down peanut butter, with grass jelly, topped with ground up Chinese peanut cakes and sugar. No dates, nothing sticky, and NO flavor other than sugar and cheap peanut cakes. A great example of \"up selling\". They use really cheap ingredients, make it look fancy, and sell it for a ton of money. This last dish made me feel like I was a rube getting fleeced. I bet their food costs are 5%. I wish the food in Singapore was as good as the food in Seoul or Tokyo but its just not. Restaurants like these confirm my opinion. The only good food in Singapore is at Hawker centers. If you go to places like this, its just for atmosphere and not for good food. Its a total waste of money.",

Though it's slightly on the pricey side, the portion was huge and we actually shared 2 main dishes among 4 girlies. We ordered the Duck and the Chicken. Though the duck was more moist in texture, the flavour was not as great as the Chicken. The chicken would have also been more enjoyable if it wasnt as dry. Overall, good taste but a slight mis-match in terms of the texture.The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and generally a nice place to hang out. May not be a top of mind place to head to, but still worth going back again someday.",

    "text": "Loved the food at Artichoke; there was a harmonious mesh of flavours and a refined symmetry in everything. For sure Artichoke's going down as one of 2016's bests eats.PSA: For first-timers to Artichoke, it's at the junction of Waterloo Street and Middle Road; the little restaurant is tucked away in a nook behind this bright yellow heritage chalet-looking building, opposite Fortune Centre and next to the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (\"SCWO\") along Waterloo Street. Park along Waterloo Street or Fortune Centre.We had:1) Slow-Roasted Lamb Shoulder ($38): sumptuous and hearty and rich but balanced, with meat so soft it practically fell off the bone. One of the very best lamb I've ever had in my life.2) Smoked Chicken ($30): succulent and perfumed with a heady char3) Greenland Halibut Fish Fingers ($28): loved the pairing with velvety squid ink tartare sauce4) Duck Adana Kebab Tacos ($18 per pair): may not have received the same amount of love as the preceding dishes, but I liked it well enough. It was texturally meaty, and its intense potency was countered by crisp apple strips, shaved radish, a drizzling of lively garlic chive oil and creamy avocado hummus. 5) Charred Broccoli ($16) strewn with a piquant hodgepodge of miso vinaigrette, crumbed feta, pickled garlic, pickled shimeiji and mint. So good we ordered seconds",

Everything we had was delicious so I will simply list everything we had and all dishes are best to be shared.For mezze we had babaganoush paired with the pita bread, rich but yummy. Had some cured swordfish and fresh figs with goat cheese which were both really refreshing. Would suggest ordering mezze to start! They are small dishes for 2-4 people.For sides we had the feta burrata, broccoli salad, and the green beans and beet. Could pass on these but it is nice to have veggies since all the other dishes are so rich.For mains we had the duck tacos which was messy to eat but yummy and filling. The hot skillet prawns are a must! The lamb shoulder dish was rich and yummy but filling and definitely for sharing.We got hot tea which actually worked so well with our meal because it helped cut the rich flavors between dishes.I definitely recommend this place and would go again and maybe try their weekend brunch.

    "text": "Really, really good Mediterranean inspired food at this cozy and rustic restaurant. The main entrance is directly opposite Fortune Center (the yellow and white building along Middle Road) and you have to walk in to a courtyard before you can see reservation counter of the restaurant. The courtyard is beautiful with a lot of plants and a couple of tables if you fancy an al-fresco dining experience and enough blood to donate to the mosquito community. If you're coming from the side door, it is just next to Torte caf\u00e9 (the brownie is to die for) at the end of Waterloo Street. I've dined at Artichoke a couple of times (both on weekend brunch and dinner) and always had the best time here. For brunch, you need to come for their Mezza platter (perfect for 2) which consist of 4 mezze (usually babaganoush, hummus, beetroot and smoked salmon) and a few slices of toasted bread. I suspect they rub the toasted bread with garlic hence making it really delicious and addictive. One portion is never enough all the time! For dinner last night, we had the usual mezze plates of hummus, babaganoush and beetroot while getting a roasted lemon chicken, burrata and deep fried cauliflower to share. All the mains were delicious and I wished we ordered second or third of the burrata (I can eat burrata everyday). The deep fried cauliflower was amazing too, the best I've tried in Singapore after Pony Dining in Eagle Strret Pier, Brisbane. Flavors were spot on accompanied by chick peas and pomegranate for that extra texture. HEAVEN. The grilled lemon chicken is moist and tender. What makes it so special is the garlic puree (no kissing after eating this, so you have been forewarned) that elevates the flavor of the chicken with a squeeze of lemon juice on it. Do check out the blackboard for weekly specials if you're into trying something new. I've heard people complaint about the price being not wallet friendly here. Well, I think it all depends on what you order and how you order. They have their best seller - The \"Lambgasm\" - a 2.8kg bone-in-lamb shoulder slow roasted with assorted condiments selling at $220. So of course, if you order this coupled with a few mains plus cocktails, the bill will definitely come up to $300 - $400. \u00a0The four of us ordered 4 mezze plates, 3 mains with no drinks and we paid a total of $124 ($28 each) last night. Considering the food we ate, the price was relatively cheap and reasonable. And we walked out from the restaurant feeling just nice (not extremely full or bloated) and very satisfied with dinner. It can get very pack during weekend brunch and dinner, so call in and make reservation to avoid any disappointment.",

    "text": "Visited at 1pm on a Sunday (reservations recommended - saw a long line for tables on the way in). Food was great, a nice change from the typical cafe fare; my only gripe was the cold service. We tried:- Cauliflower Sabbich ($22): I personally enjoyed this, though would have preferred the pita to have been toasted/grilled, and the cauliflower crunchier to provide better texture. This had a slightly soggy feel to it. The Israeli salad provided some tang, which I liked, and the smoked egg had a glorious flowy yolk - would have preferred the egg warm rather than cold though. Overall a tasty dish.- Haloumi & Mushrooms ($22): The best dish of the 3, in my opinion. The toast was thick and fluffy, with generous portions of haloumi and mushrooms. The best part was the smashed avocado spread on the toast - it was salted nicely and went beautifully when you get a piece of toast with avocado, haloumi and mushroom all in one bite. - Artichoke Fried Chicken ($24): 3 pieces of chicken on a bed of crumbled hashed browns, which went nicely with the garlic whip. Slightly too greasy for me, and the chicken had a hint of honey. Didn't enjoy the coleslaw, but the chicken was flavorful. We didn't finish this.Good quality and novel food, would return to try their intriguing dinner menu!",

    "text": "Easily one of the best Middle Eastern / Mediterranean restaurants on the Red Dot. I would describe the decor as Rustic chic, if that makes any sense.., complemented by a full array of old school pop songs to set the vibe. In layman's terms, a cool place to eat and hangout in a communal setting.The food itself is just tremendous. My wife and I started off with the Pita and hummus. It was spot on. Next up was the slow roasted lamb shoulder. Wow, simply wow. The meat just fell off the bone after the first cut, which is a testament to how tender it was. Mixed in with some amazing spices and herbs, this dish easily was the star of the meal. \u00a0The other main dish we ordered was the charcoal grilled pork belly dish. It was very good, but surprisingly sweet. I probably would not order both the lamb shoulder and the pork belly dish together as the flavours seemed to clash. Nevertheless, these dishes on their own are just fantastic.We topped the dinner off with Artichoke's Neh Neh Pops. I went for the Mango Sticky pudding rice given my penchant for anything mango. After the first bite, it was no surprise to me that this was the best seller. \u00a0Common, how can you beat coconut rice mixed with blocks of frozen mango. Great food, Great Vibe, Great Company. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes, but of course order that lamb shoulder again.",

We walked and found this restaurant tucked away with cobblestone-like area leading up to it's entrance. You're immediately greeted by the dessert case and then are seated in either patio or inside space. The ambiance is overall chic/hip. The lighting in the evening is soft and romantic. The food is phenomenal and the service is very good as well. This is one of my favorite tapas joints in Singapore. We started with the red sangria pitcher and then ordered the roasted cauliflower, which had pomegranate. It was so tasty and different! We also got the whole market fish ($34), roasted pumpkin, and humus. They brought out pita, but we were good Paleo kids and didn't touch it. We saved our cheat for the dark chocolate and almond baklava. Delicious. We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Found this place with the help of yelp and am very glad I did. It is in a very nice location on Waterloo Road, not far from the MRT. You walk in off the street and right away you get the sense that this place is a little bit different. An outdoor patio (covered, thank goodness) as well as seating indoors. I was there just before opening but the staff were very pleasant, giving me a menu to look at while they busied themselves getting ready. Once inside and seated at the bar (I was by myself, so that seemed the best option - also I didn't have a reservation and they were clearly going to be busy that night) I met the manager, Ronnie, and was immediately charmed. The beer was frosty and cold (-1 C, according to the fridge), and the music was excellent; very edgy but not off-putting or too loud. I ordered the \"chef's menu\" and was blown away. Everything was excellent, from the starters to the main courses to the dessert. Presentation was artful but not fussy. Loved the range of flavours, the wood-smoked beef was a particular hit (they have a wood fire oven in the kitchen). It is definitely on my list of places to return to.",

    "text": "Everyone around me knows my stinginess for giving 5 stars. But not only do I give this jewel a 5 star, but also would go as far as saying, if I were to recommend just one restaurant to have a unique tantalizing food experience in Singapore -- other than the local options like chicken rice & chili crab that everyone must check off their list -- \u00a0it would've be Artichoke. (But with that being said, I have heard the same thing being said about Burnt Ends -- which I will definitely try soon enough.) Artichoke offers creative dishes, while staying true to the root of its cuisine. (Yes, regardless of how delicious their food is, some restaurants just puzzle me with what cuisine they are serving to me.) \u00a0How delicately they pull this off-- amazing. Here goes the breakdown: Hummus (4.5/5) -- No frill. GOOD hummus-- not the watered-down version that makes you question how much of chickpeas is in it. A bit of a bummer that it doesn't come with any pita bread. I know I can just eat spoonful(s) of hummus by itself, but come one, not even one? Pita Bread (4.5/5) -- Served hot. Pita bread served here is on the thicker side. Not too chewy, but I can tell it's good quality & actually understand why this is a separate item to be ordered rather than served on the side, although I complained above on not coming with my hummus order. This is a must order as many of the dishes at Artichoke has sauces that deserves to be wiped to the bottom with this pita bread. \u00a0Fresh Fig & Goat cheese (5/5) -- I admit that even from just reading this menu, I knew that I was to fall in love. Fig & goat cheese simply cannot go wrong. But then again, how Artichoke artfully put together fresh fig on a spread of creamy goat cheese was just orgasmic. Feta Burrata (5/5) -- Really fresh & unique twist to the regular burrata dishes. I'd say this is the prime example of what I meant by 'creative while staying true to the root'. Some may argue that burrata is Italian, but adding the feta kick to it absolutely justified its presence on the Mediterranean menu. Innovative & just plain delicious. Hot Skillet Prawn (5/5) -- Jesus. My friend and I almost licked the skillet. 4 HUGE prawns that was better than lobster. Sauce was not to be wasted. I remember this dish being rather salty last time but this time, they were perfect. Have this. Just have it. Slow-roasted Lamb Shoulder (5/5) -- SO SUCCULENT & FULL OF FLAVOR! Another dish that requires pita bread to wash the plate. Lamb was so well-roasted -- the texture of the meat was soft while not mushy. The smell of the lamb was very well controlled (I know for some people the strong smell particular to lamb meat is of problem). Babaganoush (3.5/5) -- Don't get me wrong. Just because I raved about other dishes so much doesn't mean that babaganoush was bad. It was just different from my expectation of creamy dark colored paste. Artichoke's babaganoush made it very obvious that it was made of eggplant (the texture and taste is maintained, unlike other babaganoush I've tried). It was good, but I prefer my creamy dark colored version. Neh Neh pops -- It shows that you don't have to go crazy complicated to come up with a strongly branded item. Neh Neh pop's simple yet alluring presentation along with its hand-packed-looking packaging crafts a sense of craft (no pun intended) -- which draws people, making them ignore the little voice in their head saying 'it's just magnum with bunch of stuffs put all over'. They seem to be actively experimenting with the flavors -- such as Neh-espresso, Cheesecake, etc. Looking forward to all the fun flavors. - Baklava flavor (3/5): I am a huge fan of balkava -- how its crispness is preserved while keeping all the mouth-watering sweetness in between its layers. But really not impressed by this flavor on NehNeh pops. Ice cream wasn't rich either (actually tasted a bit of icy-ness, which is what I taste when ice cream melts & then re-freezes.) I wouldn't go for it. A bit too sweet as baklava's sugary sweetness and ice cream & chocolate's deeper sweetness strikes your tastebuds separately creating a not-so-pleasant overdose of sweetness. - Strawberry pokey (4/5): Contrary to my initial standing that it'd be rather boring, its back-to-basic approach was done very well. I don't think the cover was white chocolate -- which really works for me. I look for a lot of things when visiting a restaurant, but here food speaks for the brand. The ambiance & entirety of experience isn't bad, but not impression-leaving. Food is just so well-done. It is not only delicious, un-pretentious, but also fun. This is combination of using good ingredients, adding succulent flavors, playing with mix of tastes, while not losing touch in presentation.",
