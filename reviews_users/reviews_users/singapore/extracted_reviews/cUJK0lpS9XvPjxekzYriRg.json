    "text": "That pork cutlet fried rice - enough said. Given the huge portion, I wouldn't call this a restaurant price. This is more close to a cafe price, or even comparable to hawker stir-fry price. \u00a0No comments on the other food items, you get what you paid for, neither fantastically heavenly nor bad. But that pork cutlet fried rice.... pork cutlet fried rice... yummy (and in abundance)!",

    "text": "This is my favorite $$ restaurant in the ENTIRE WORLD. I've visited Singapore once a year since I've moved to California, and every time, I come to this Din Tai Fung.Things to get:Xiao long bao (5/5): This is what their famous for. I could eat 20 of these on my own. Zha jiang mian (5/5): Their sauce is unique, haven't found it anywhere else, SO GOOD. Portions are a bit small though.Beef noodle soup (5/5): Again, smaller sized portionPork chop fried rice (5/5): This is their best fried rice. The pork chops are cooked wonderfully, super tasty, not too salty.Taro / red bean dessert buns (5/5): Get the ones that come in a set of 10. These ones are wrapped with the super thin XLB skins and they pack it with as much taro/red bean possible. I know I just gave every dish here a 5/5 and that's because I truly think the food is outstanding, hence the waits every time. Maybe when a location opens up in San Francisco area I'll feel differently, but eating this once a year makes it so so so good. Service is also good, they're very prompt.",

Not sure if they take reservations, but at least plan to get there early to put your name down, and then go for a walk around the mall.",

But we saw that they no longer make all the noodles or dumpling fresh at the restaurant. \u00a0 They are making the components offsite and putting them together at the location. \u00a0 This is likely their answer to the labour shortage in Singapore. Would rate them a 3.5. We will see if they can maintain their quality but they have lost their uniqueness.",

    "text": "This is a combination review of two lunches with colleagues at the Din Tai Fung in Tampines Mall.It is busy at lunch. \u00a0It may be busy all of the time. \u00a0But, I have only been there at lunch. \u00a0It is pretty chaotic. \u00a0But the staff seems to know how to bring order out of the chaos or should I say get your order out of the chaos. They get the orders sorted and they get folks seated and they keep it moving.Once you get seated, the food will start arriving. \u00a0Don't expect the staff to get all lovey-dovey or anything. \u00a0But do expect them to keep everything moving along at a brisk pace.The ambiance is pretty straightforward. It is what I expect from a relatively nice dim sum/Chinese restaurant.The food ranges from good to very good.Dim sum - The soup dumplings are very good. To many, they are legendary. \u00a0For me, I am going to stick with very good. \u00a0When mixed with the sauce, they are explosions. \u00a0I also like their shrimp purses. \u00a0Well, that is what I call them and I am not sure what the rest of the world calls them.tinyurl.com/ch4l7n9tinyurl.com/c43gyoyPork Cutlet - This is a good dish. \u00a0But it is certainly not anything out of the ordinary. \u00a0It is good for adding some protein to the meal though. \u00a0the pork is tender and the rice is almost perfectly prepared.tinyurl.com/abem2w2Beef Tendon Soup - This soup is rich and deep. \u00a0I am not a huge tendon fan but this soup definitely works for me. \u00a0 There is just such a bold beefy flavour in the broth.tinyurl.com/aq3az5lGreens - I am not exactly sure what kind of greens these were. \u00a0But, they passed my test. \u00a0They are very well prepared. \u00a0I especially like the greens portion. I am not as excited by the stems. \u00a0tinyurl.com/aa2q9r9Overall - Din Tai Fung has really good food served in a fast hectic environment. \u00a0The meal is kept on the rails by a diligent staff who brings order to the craziness. \u00a0It all makes for a very enjoyable lunch. \u00a0I would certainly return.",

I suppose it set the benchmark for other eateries to surpass and if i remember correctly, it was quite enjoyable feasting on basket after basket of xiao long bao.Unfortunately, I've been to other eateries in the past year that have surpassed the xiao long bao of din tai fung in taste and price.Their la mian is decent but I suppose the 'start of the show' is still the xiao long bao. I guess its time for them to up the game a little.",

    "text": "While Din Tai Fung is a chain that has many restaurants throughout Singapore, I would say that this Tampines branch is one of the best, simply because ever since I started coming here their service levels have not wavered one bit. While yes, prices have gone up around 7% since 2012, people still keep coming back as they keep the quality of food consistent, and prices are still considered pretty decent for what New York Times has rated as one of the top ten restaurant chains in the world.Be prepared though, to queue up to an hour for dinner on weekends as this place is so popular amongst families and couples. It's also pretty crowded even for dinner on weekdays, but waiting time is probably around 15 mins to half an hour.Try their fried rice which is fluffy and doesn't feel too oily, the Xiao Cai, XIao Long Bao, Beef Noodle Soup, Prawn Pancake and Dan Dan Mian.Highly recommended, if you don't mind the wait for good food (perhaps go shop around before coming back)",
