This was what ruined every other char kway teow for me. Every trip back home for the past 5 years has included me coming straight down here for a $4 plate of deliciousness. Nothing else, nowhere else will suffice. The perfectly cooked noodles are laden with cockles, Chinese sausage and those sublime pieces of crispy pork lard. The flavour is indescribable - gritty, wholesome and with wok hei. Each order is freshly cooked and served hot. The smallest portion costs $3 which is more than enough for me. Queues are predictably long in the evenings but the aroma of cooking will tide you over.",

    "text": "I have a confession to make - I'm scared of wooden spoons. How scared?- Like being in a demonic nightmare you can't awake from- Like jumping out of a plane only to realise you forgot to take the parachute- Like being chased by a hungry cheetah and you're wearing thongs(In Oz we call this being sh!t scared! OR wearing the brown underpants!)Why am I scared? It all stems from my youth, when as a horrible child I got up to all sorts of mischief, which resulted in being disciplined (on the knuckles initially), by my mother - using a long wooden spoon. My naughty nature was such that she got so adept at using the thing she could hit me with it from another room, around walls, and over her shoulder without looking.So why bring all this up? Well... back in the day my mother lived in Singapore, and one of the dishes she brought back to Australia was char kway teow. It remains one of her favourite dishes to this day. Now I have grown up on her version of this dish, and totally loved it for years myself, so upon coming to Singapore I was interested in seeing how authentic her version was and if I found one better would I once again incur the wrath of the wooden spoon?Cue: No. 18 Zion Road Char Kway TeowThis was also my first hawker centre visit, so I was interested in the concept itself.Upon arriving I walked past endless stalls which only had 1 or 2 customers lining up for their food until I arrived at stall 18. Kaboom, a good 15-20 people lining up. Had I timed my run too late? I knew that it was closing at 3pm, and I'd gotten here at 2:10pm thinking I'd have enough time... As the line slowly progressed that time was running out, but then as if like magic, a big pile of orders were delivered at once and I was served probably 20-30 minutes after getting into the line (maybe quicker).The serving sizes are Small ($3.50 used to be $3), Medium ($4) and Large ($5).The glutton in me will pick the largest size 9 times out of 10 but I decided to be pragmatic here and opted eventually for the medium size.It was the right choice. The medium is a big enough serve for a hungry man, and given that char kway teow is quite heavy on the calories it's probably the best one to go for in terms of bang-for-your-buck-and-keeping-healthy balance.What I really loved seeing, when it was finally my time to order, was a photo of the cook/owner stuck alongside his grill. It had to be from 25-30 years ago. And for him to still be doing this, and churning out the same dish endlessly shows a real passion for the product.When I had the dish in my hands I made my way to a spare table in the centre and took a seat. Whilst I let the aroma of the dish invade my nostrils, the upbeat crappy but totally catchy Ronan Keating played over the speakers, followed by Owl City. I think it was important to mention this, because you feel good here. You feel somewhat light-hearted, and I think that is a great feeling to have on a weekend after work, just a carefree sort of afternoon with a nice meal.So what's the verdict Dan? Was it better than your mums? Here's the stickler. I'm loathe to say it was, for fear of that wooden spoon (or even never having the dish again) - but it was somewhat different in both flavour and texture.18 Zion introduce a generous amount of fresh cockles into the dish, and these juicy sweet bursts of flavour really cut through the richness of the dish, which I think is important as it can be quite rich. The pork lard crackling is an element I have never had before and it is exceptional, when you bite into one of those crunchy croutons of bacon-ness you are transported to flavour town.They also use a much darker thicker sauce, and the lap cheong whilst prevalent is diced much smaller than I'm used to - in such a way that it incorporates into the dish and is not something you identify separately - which is a key difference because it really rounds out the flavours.I loved this dish it was so flavourful and it is easy to see why it is considered one of Singapore's best exponents of CKT. However, I am also mindful that a dish like this is calorific - CKT sits at #6 for most calories in Singapore's Top 50 hawker foods with a whopping 745 calories based on a standard plating size - That's close enough to 3 Big Macs (257 cals each) to put it in perspective. If CKT wasn't so heavy on the calories I'd probably eat here very often.",

This stall is one of those that prides itself with its many cut-out positive newspaper reviews pasted at the stall front. Perhaps the one thing that amuses me most is the signboard above the stall that reads \"Hallelujah! Charismatic cooking.\"The char kway teow here is famous and popular, as evidenced by the line during peak hours. The small bites of crispy pork lard are a nice sinful treat. The fish cakes are lovely. There is also a generous amount of cockles- almost every spoonful of noodle into my mouth has a piece of cockle in it, which is my fav. The fried noodles is moist and flavorful with a good depth.",
