    "text": "Jaan is situated on the 70th floor of the Swissotel, and has a aerial view of the whole of Singapore's central district. The restaurant seats only 40 people max which means that you get a lot of personal space and dedicated service. If you are able to take your eyes away from the beautiful view out of the window, you will notice the crystals decorating the ceiling of the restaurant which gives the whole place a classy and ornate look.I went to Jaan when Chef Julien Royer was there. All the dishes were beautifully presented and the innovative and complex tastes really pushed our taste buds to the limit. The service was also impeccable. This is what fine dining should be and there is nothing more that I can ask for.They have an extremely good for value lunch menu of $58 for 3 courses or $88 for 5 courses. Dinner menus costs more and you can also order from the a la carte menu. The menu changes every season so do go to their website to download their latest menu.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this restaurant but, alas, they were dashed. \u00a0The location and sights are amazing. \u00a0Several of the dishes tasted quite good. \u00a0But I think what got me was that the dishes all involved a lot of the technique of modern haute cuisine, but seemingly without any real soul. You probably ask, \"What is that supposed to mean?\" What I mean is that many of the dishes were drawn with complex and varied textures and flavors that did not merge into a coherent and meaningful whole. Consider the salad: olive oil nodules, freshly warmed berry, wilted field greens, heirloom carrot, etc. Every element was done with great detail. But in the end, it was all sorted onto the plate like a pile (well, curved like a J). \u00a0The flavors run all over each other, and there isn't a core experience of what these flavors are together supposed to create in your mouth. \u00a0Except for the amuse bouche (the mushroom tea in a bodum shot glass)--other dishes were the same. There also was no real theme to the meal that I could understand. \u00a0The beef was excellently cooked, and served with a fine risotto. \u00a0But the beef and the risotto don't seem to balance and complement each other at all. \u00a0It seemed like there was so much excellent technique, but when all was said and done the parts of the meal do not sum to anything greater than these several parts. \u00a0I had expected much better for the venue, the hype, and the price.Separately about service, we could not stomach the oysters. We even made a point to mention to the server that we thought they were bad when she asked, but she made no effort to find out what we meant or to rectify it. If I'm asked why I did not eat something, then I hope you will try to understand what I said and act on it. Otherwise, please do not ask.",

    "text": "This is a restaurant that competes with the best in the world. Falling into a fiercely competitive Uber restaurant category that has it's mainstays with 14 course dinners, finest ingredients, best service, culinary technique and as a result high prices. The restaurants I can compare it to are Alinea and True from Chicago and although it was the most expensive dinner my wife and I have ever had it could not measure up to these giants of culinary excellence. Don't get me wrong, it's still an amazing place, so let me start with what I liked.It holds a breath-taking view at the top of the Singapore Swiss Otel. From this lofty perch it commands a view of the surrounding city as well as Marina bay. The ceiling has glass plates resembling mother of pearl giving you the impression there is a sort of origami clam shell floating above you. Both food and drinks have a wow factor. I got a sort of egg white, apricot Bellini with the most delightful hard whipped foam on top. Food taste was excellent, using the best ingredients in the most delightful combinations. Some dishes had excellent presentation namely the amuse bouche was perhaps one of the largest and best presentations I've had. It came on a mix of holders; some rock, others bamboo and had a sauce you would eat out of a stylized can.Another favorite presentation was when we received a carton of eggs opened up, with dry ice billowing a fog below it. The egg was deposited by our waiter onto the top of a delicious soup. All I've said so far is amazing so why 3 stars? Indeed it's not in the piece by piece breakdown but in the comparison to other cream of the crop restaurants that brings it down.- I think back to Alinea where I ate a fruit leather balloon or had a decadently filled Chocolate urn shattered onto my waterproof tablecloth. Those were wow moments, I never even imagined food could be served like this, Jaan did not offer surprises of this level. - Dinner prices are the equivalent of an intercontinental flight. A meal at this price is one you don't just hope to remember, you need to remember it. One way of facilitating this is through a printout you can take of the menu. I've gotten these each time, even embossed with my name on them. It's not that I'm going to frame the thing but it can certainly help me remember the experience fondly.- When the cheese tray rolled around as one of the last items I thought to myself well I'm pretty full already but heck this is probably some grade A amazing cheese and I've already paid for it. I was half right; although we had some smelly flavorful cheeses elegantly served they were not included in our chef's tasting menu. I'm a bit upset that I was served cheese costing 140 without anyone bothering to inform me it was not included; I had that expectation from other fine dining restaurants that had included it. I would have certainly denied it to fill up on more of what was to come if I had known. All in all the food was great in taste but presentation that was not up to par with other uber restaurants and not being told about the extra costs set this experience back for me.",

    "text": "Interesting but felt chef was trying to hard. Way too complex compilation and presentation. We had 7 course dinner which was actually ten or eleven. It was just too much; it's difficult to explain. For an example, one dish had many ingredients in the bowl. It was served with an egg heated to 55 degrees for 60 minutes, and was pointed out this was an exact process. They then poured the soft egg onto other contents in bowl and stir. Guess what? \u00a0It tasted like a bowl of yolk. Which is fine but what's the point of all the other ingredients? \u00a0All were like this. The foie gras was best I ever had but all the other stuff took away from it. The pidgin Brest was the only thing I really enjoyed, cooked to perfection. It was only thing I could eat alone although it to was served with a bunch of other distracting stuff I just ignored. All in all, the complexity was a gastronomic distraction and I felt I was eating various states of stews and goulashes. A great chef should be able to produce spectacular dishes without so much variation in one serving. One dish had perfect piece of fish, served with bits of fried squid, topped with caviar, and then a bunch of odd greens and sprouts. Served as a meal with appropriate portions it could have complemented one another but to eat all that in a single bite you got none of the pleasantness of the ingredients and were just left with a mouthful of fishy mush. Well, just one persons thoughts. \u00a0 .",

All of the staff were brilliant, with our hostess providing a delightfully quirky approach that helped us relax and settle in to enjoy the theatre that is Jaan. We went for the 5 course option, but with all the treats and delights, this really becomes more like 10. Even though it's degustation and the servings appear small, over the course of the meal you finished sated and your taste buds have truly experience an extraordinary variety.After enjoying the truly amazing culinary delights, to have Chef Kirk drop by for a chat was a highlight. Thank you for making mum's 80th birthday lunch such a memorable moment.",

Of all of the French restaurants I have been to located in Cali, NYC, Vegas and France they all have many different types and varieties of bread. This place just had one type, a wheat sour dough and didn't taste good.I think the best part of the meal was the dessert as all of the items didn't go well together and flavors were a bit off.Don't think I will come back to this place even if it were free.",

Dishes are decent, use high quality ingredients & taste light on the palate, but nothing exciting, nor interesting even though some of them had truffle & truffle jus.Service is as expected for a fine dining establishment. Staff are friendly & attentive. However, during my lunch, they were supposed to serve petit fours & they forgot to serve it until i asked!For the price, lunch is always a better value but i would recommend other better restaurants in singapore other than jaan for a good time with better tasting dishes. Definitely not 1 of the best restaurants in singapore despite being on Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list.",

    "text": "Wow.How to describe this experience? Hard, with words.Best start at the beginning.I booked some weeks ago, the occasion being my hubbies birthday. In my first inquiry I also stated that I'd love a window table which wasn't available any longer - we would be kept on the waiting list.Also, they offered a complimentary birthday cake and I was able to chose up to 4 words on it.The entire booking process was very smooth, once I chose a menu (3 menus available, you have to choose one of them per table beforehand), I gave our dietary requirements and the wording on the cake, I had also asked about dress code (men with long trousers- jeans are ok - and long sleeved shirts, ladies elegant), and my contact Patricia was very professional and friendly.When I arrived on the night, prior to my husband, I was welcomed by Patricia - so nice seeing my email-contact in person, she was lovely - and led to a window table, yay! (Surprise! was her reaction :-))My husband arrived and we ordered champagne by the glass, received the amuse bouche, followed by choosing a white wine. This being the only element of the night I wasn't too pleased with as it did not taste at all like the sommelier described - but that's subjective and did not diminish the overall experience.The pace at which the 5 course menu was then served suited us fine: faster in the beginning and slower toward the end. We were famished and devoured the bread offered so we were glad for food arriving smoothly.The food.. a feast for the eyes every single time, and quite a show as well (dry ice helps) - with the items on each plate being arranged in the perfect order, to be scooped up just as is - for the most delectable combination of flavour and aromas.I have seldom had such a combination of different cooking styles (fermentation, slow cooking, raw food..) that went so well together.Personally, I do not believe much in overly \"experimental\" or molecular cooking as I want to eat properly when I'm hungry and enjoy great quality combined with creative excellency, as is the case with chef Kirk Westaway's cooking.Oh, and chef stepped out of the kitchen to present dessert himself, spraying warm chocolate mousse (to die for) into a 'variation of chocolate' bowl, asking everyone how they liked their food. Needless to say, my hubbies' birthday cake, which was served at the end, was most delectable - we had it at home the next day.I cannot wait for the next occasion that justifies the expense for an evening at JAAN :-)",

    "text": "To say Kirk Westaway is a storyteller is an understatement. He spins fairytales. His attention to details, the subtlety and balance in his pretty dishes, the overall ebb and flow, ups and downs, and then that happily ever after that ended on the perfect note.. Needless to say, i was won over dish after dish during my 4 hour long 10 course dinner. Julien may be the punchy one, but you'll never get sick of Kirk and you'd want more of his dishes.The first serving of Wagyu beef tartare, with a clever \"Fish & Chips\" (done a la French fine dining), a foie gras and truffle macaron (salty, creamy, sweet and chewy), and an olive cracker with olive pur\u00e9e and cheddar cheese (superbly crumbly). You know this Briton has a sense of humor with this French rendition of English food.Then came the best onion brioche i've tasted. Those layers and that subtle onion flavor..From the land, we dived right into the ocean with the Majestic Irish Oyster (from Donegal) with Artichoke cream, and 'Oscietra' caviar. Loved the creamy, plump and firm texture of the Irish oyster, which was balanced with the slightly nutty Artichoke cream. And then you have those pops of the sea as the caviar bursts. Then it was back to more refreshing bites with the Tomato Collection. Kirk took the humble tomato and cheese dish and elevated it to typical JAAN standard. The many flavors are coaxed from the vine-ripened heirloom tomato- first cooked sous vide in a tomato consomm\u00e9 to intensify its flavours, then stuffed with a mixture of cubed Oxheart tomatoes, gherkins, capers and oregano. It was then restored to its original shape by the process of dehydrating and rehydrating the fruit. The supporting basil sorbet, green basil and mimolette cheese pesto, Japanese tomato berries, olive soil, burrata brought out the intense sweetness of the tomato, by providing a refreshing song in the background. This is the most sophisticated and complicated tomato I've eaten. Another gorgeous plate was the Farmer's Harvest with Hand Dived Scottish Scallop, a dish that changes with the season. A combination of sous vide and roasted, blanched, baked, pickled, pureed, grilled root and leafy seasonal vegetables provided the different textures and that Carrasco ham added a nutty salty balance for that meaty flavor. There is just so many evolving layers on 1 plate! Of course the perfectly seared scallops contribute to the meatiness of this dish. A short break later and bam. Kirk hits home with comfort and stability with the Line Caught John Dory served with crayfish tail, fava beans, broad beans, clams and pea puree. The dish is finished with a pea velout\u00e9 poured tableside. I felt stuffed but i couldn't help but finish every bit of this perfectly browned fish. This is almost an Asian dish i feel. The Roasted Venison Saddle was the most heavy handed dish of the lot but the meal peaks here. A New Zealand venison is served medium rare, with celeriac ribbons that have been blanched in wholegrain mustard emulsion, pear glazed in port sauce, pear chutney and celeriac puree. Ah such lovely Christmas flavors. I thought it was a tad salty for me though. Dessert song with a lilt. High again on the Ivory Caramel, an out of this world chocolate dessert made with 45% Michel Cluizel white chocolate, flourless chocolate sponge with tempered chocolate sheets are joined by French caramelised hazelnuts and sous vide Aero chocolate.",

    "text": "Jaan, derived from the ancient Sanskrit word for 'bowl', is currently ranked 29th in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants. Currently lead by Chef de Cuisine Kirk Westway, Jaan offers elevated modern french cuisine with imaginative twists and beautiful aesthetics. I visited this establishment with Miss M in September 2015 as a celebration for both of our birthdays.This restaurant had been on my to-go list for a very long time. Having only 40 seats in the dining room, it was quite a challenge to get a reservation in their restaurant. During my previous visit to Singapore, I had tried calling them up to reserve a table one week in advance, but it was fully booked. So during my subsequent trip, I've made sure to e-mail them about one month in advance.Located on the 70th floor of Equinox Complex, entering the restaurant is an experience by itself. There is a booth at the ground floor that leads the way to an elevator up to the restaurant. After passing through several short hallways, we entered the restaurant and were lucky enough to be seated at a table with a spectacular view that oversees the Marina Bay Sands. The set up of the dining room felt really special with its bright, classy interior at such a high elevation. This was by far the most romantic restaurant I've ever been.Dining at Jaan was one of the best fine dining experiences I've had so far. At a very affordable price point of $118, I would say that their lunch degustation was more than worth it. However, be mindful that they have an additional charge for their amuse bouche which was automatically included in our lunch.Their stand out dishes were the heirloom tomato collection and their rosemary infused organic egg. I can't praise them enough for the creativity and artistry demonstrated in all of their dishes. All of their plates looked so aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. All these factors combined, along with excellent service, lead to a very enjoyable meal.",

    "text": "Quite simply, Jaan is one of the best fine dining restaurants in Singapore and another one of what I would expect to get the top Michelin Star marks. Writing about Jaan on here is like doing so for Andre, almost every review written is much better than what I can ever write.Nik T., Birgit W, and many others definitely do a great job putting an experience identical to my own into words. It was a very surprising and highly impressive experience...and I was there for Valentine's Day! Foodwise, it was great and again I think others do a great job in putting the menu into words. So instead I will write about my experience.I was expecting a typical boring French restaurant that you'd find in London, NYC and other cities that are pretentious and uninspiring with your traditional pigeon, foie gras, sea bass, etc but was pleasantly surprised from beginning to end where Chef Kirk Hathaway did a hell of an amazing job putting together a menu of creative and tasteful delights. Yes he did use those boring ingredients I mentioned but in a very unique way with a new flavor than that I've ever had before.The view also can't be beat and you gotta do your best to get a table with the view.Only downsides - the biggest is the wine list. It's weak and lacks a lot of depth. I hate the iPad wine list too and I hope these high end restaurants (French Laundry and Per Se included) start getting rid of it. One of the coolest and more impressive things about restaurants is if they bring out a brick of a wine list binder - everyone always goes WOW by it. Not a dirty iPad that God knows how many people touched. Also, I'm not sure if the French guy is the sommelier but he didn't do much with suggestions or even offering to pour our expensive bottle of wine into a decanter (it needed it). I hope this was a Valentine's Day thing only since it was busy, but there was no one there to pour the wine even after multiple requests (it was on a separate table since there was no room on our table) when our glasses were empty.Second is that I wish they only staff servers that know the food courses inside and out and are passionate about it. There were a few courses where the server would come out and recite what was memorized and quickly leave which was pretty annoying for a place like that, especially if I can't understand their accent.Otherwise, everything was perfect and made for one memorable Valentine's Day. The staff really was very kind and made everything that we want happen for us. The main server who was running around still was a total rockstar. One of the greatest parts was that Chef Kirk actually came out and greeted us with one of the desserts. We chatted for a good while about a number of topics. It was awesome. I hope other restaurants start adopting this personal touch.Highly recommend for that special someone or a great family dinner. Book at least a week in advance or maybe you'll get lucky if booking later and on a weekday. Totally deserves the best!",

An absolutely tremendous view of the skyline - able to see the Singapore Flyer and the Gardens by the Bay. It is as if you are dining in a spaceship overlooking Pandora from Avatar fame.Next the service. Attentive and worthy of accolades from the Michelin Guide (once it comes to Singapore), and definitely comparable to the some of the best restaurants in New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, etc.And then the food. OH THE FOOD. Some of my most memorable food experiences have come at Marea, Lahaina Grill, Morimoto and Le Bernadin. The atmosphere, the company, the service and most importantly the food all come together to create the best possible experience. Put Jaan right up there on the list. All of the food was perfectly seasoned, cooked extremely well, and presented in a way that made you just sit and admire (before polishing the plate clean). A phenomenal experience.",

    "text": "Jaan is constantly rated as one of the best dining experiences in Singapore and in Asia so I must admit I had some pretty high expectations when arriving on the top floor of the Swissotel where it is located. I must say that I also had some fears about how the service would be as it was an annoying experience booking with them - they required as to pre-select which menu we wanted (they offered three options: 5-Course Degustation Menu at S$198++ per person, - \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a07-Course Prestige Menu at S$238++ per person and 10-Course Gastronomic Menu at S$298++ per person) as well as providing scanned copies of the credit card. To me just ridiculous to have such processes in place but anyway after some discussions with them managed to reach a solution. Our group had opted for the 7-course menu and as I am not always a fan of seafood I had asked for that to be excluded from the menu.In a sense it is a really nice location with beautiful views over Singapore but the design of the place is weird and does not at all look stylish or classy and to me at also lacks charm and warmth so would hope they redecorate. Upon arriving we were asked if we wanted a drink to start with - as is too often the case we were not presented with any menu but rather just a mention of a few of the options without any prices mentioned. Had to specifically ask to see the wine list and then saw that many of the wines had insane mark-ups even for Singaporean standards. We settled on a half-bottle of Champagne to split as we just wanted a small glass before dinner. While we were then still studying the wine list and the options the first dishes started coming in. No problem for us but when we were then ready to order wine for the meal the surprise came. One person the table wanted the wine pairing and was then told it was impossible as he had already eaten the first dish - he said it was fine Just serve that wine now and he will still drink it but the staff insisted it was not possible as it was a wine pairing. Luckily the sommelier saw that we were not really happy at this point and came over and asked if she could help and then she quickly said it is of course not a problem. Still not the type of service expected at this sort of place.The waitress we had actually was a bit off as she put out the cutlery on the table on the correct side of the plate for three of us but constantly reversed it for the fourth person at the table (the same person who she refused to let order the wine pairing). Otherwise the service was fine but at nice restaurants it is the little things that should also stand out.The food was ranging from very good to excellent but interestingly enough the replacement dishes I received not wanting fish and seafood were by far the best dishes and left the others at the table jealous. Looking at the price level of Jaan (the bill with wine, food, coffee/tea came to around 600 SGD per person) it was not at all as good as expected and it pales in comparison with some of the other top restaurants in Asia (thinking the likes of L'effervesence, Takazawa, Narisawa, Issaya Siamese Club, Gaggan, Eat Me and Nahm) and clearly with similar restaurants in both Europe and the US so I was a but underwhelmed. I am not saying that it was bad but just not good enough and I am not even ranking this as one of the best places in Singapore so while perfectly acceptable I will not visit again as there are so many other better places.",

We didn't ask for it but had a table next to the window and I definitely think it's worth requesting.",

(two person course meal with wine was around $750 including tax) It's the best fine dining in Singapore and the food was up to par compared with all the top restaurants' in New York. \u00a0The restaurant is very private, with only up to six tables in the whole restaurant. it overlooks an amazing view facing the Suntec building and you'd be at awe being on the 70th floor of the Swisshotel. It was a perfect birthday dinner surprise dinner by my hubby.They're known for their pigeon meat- I tried for the first time and I'm not sure what to think of it. It's tender and tastes like chicken, but it's pigeon. My mind and palette were going at each other and my conclusion is that it was delish and at least i've tried it once in my life and not sure if I'd try again. I'm an adventurous eater but eating a pigeon was a bit too much. All other dishes were made to perfection and I loved each and every one of their 14 course meals! Hopefully I'll return again soon!",
