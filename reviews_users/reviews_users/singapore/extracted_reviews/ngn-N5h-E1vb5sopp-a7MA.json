    "text": "Best meal during my 4-day trip. If you're a vegetarian, you definitely need to eat at Joie by Dozo. If you're a meat eater like myself (more of a flexitarian) but enjoy and appreciate vegetarian cuisine, you'll also enjoy Joie. It's definitely on the pricier side, but go during lunch for the best value, as you get the same selection as dinner, except for the cold starter, for almost half the price. Service was good and quick. Each dish was brought out swiftly just as the last one was finished. (I could've used a little breathing room in between, though, to air out my belly.) The servers also explained each dish as they were brought out and answered any questions we had. We were also seated by the window in their sunroom. We got a nice view of the Singapore vista from high up, but also of their goldfish pond that runs alongside the outside garden/patio area. Standouts include the gratinated champignon with mozzarella appetizer, soups (pumpkin and cepes & truffle), bai ling mushroom steak entr\u00e9e, and dessert (and fruit tea). The gratinated champignon is served in an escargot platter, with a button mushroom placed inside each slot instead of snails and fresh mozzarella layered on top and cooked to a nice browness (would pair perfectly with wine). I'm a bit of a soup snob, but I found their soups to be very fragrant. You get a nice hit of truffle in the cepes & truffle soup, and the pumpkin, though not thick, is a nice smooth, rich consistency. And the best dish yet was the bai ling mushroom steak served on a hot stone. I've actually had something very similar before in Taiwan at a place called Yu Shan Ge, but the presentation here and the way they plated it on the hot stone so you get a nice hard crispness (think a nice sear on a steak) on the outside was more to my liking. Wish it came with more sauce, but it's still an A+ in my book. Their desserts were also a nice finish. The lavender tea, which was straight lavender, was a nice palate cleanser but could've been served hotter (served lukewarm). The warm chocolate cake was nothing special but still tasty. The truffle cr\u00e8me brulee was different. Heavily laced with truffle, you'll either love it or hate it, as it's a very specialized dessert. \u00a0Their chilled fruit tea was also a nice finisher with its lavender color and robust fruitiness. Not everything was a slam dunk, though. What I would pass on would be the tempura platter on mash and truffle risotto--both fell flat on taste. The tempura was a charcoal batter, so the black color was unappetizing, and it wasn't crispy and was under-seasoned. They used vegetables that all had the same consistency--a bit mushy--and was hard to discern what was what. As for the risotto--unlike the soup and dessert, the truffle flavor fell short and it was also under-seasoned. I would advise calling or booking ahead. They weren't overly busy the Friday afternoon we went, but we since we loved it so much, we returned that Sunday again before leaving, only to find they closed the entire restaurant for a private celebration (it's shocking they'd close on a weekend).Ultimately, down to its quality, presentation and taste, it's one of the best-tasting vegetarian restaurants that I've been to--and I've been to a lot. Each dish has an elevated sophistication to it that few other vegetarian restaurants worldwide are currently doing, because, usually, \"fine dining\" and \"all-vegetarian\" rarely go hand in hand--though it should. And between the starters, refreshers (passion fruit granita, aka ice slushy)/snacks (fried noodles) and entree, one thing's for sure--you will not walk away hungry nor disappointed.",

We are also served lemon flavoured ice blended drink as palate cleanser.For the 1st course which is Starter, everyone starts with the Chef's Selection of Assorted Platter. It consists of salmon sashimi, wasabi cracker and raspberry sphere. The sashimi is yummy that I could not taste that it is made of carrot. The sphere bursts easily in the mouth with a bite and filling all with raspberry taste.For 2nd course which is Side Dish, there is 4 choices available.Transparency of Manchego Cheesecherry tomato, red, green and yellow peppers, croutons, walnut and black olivesVery colorful looking with flowers on top.Gratinated Champignon with Mozzarellabutton mushrooms gratin served with Tennessee heirloom potato puree and Belgian endive, focacciaRich and creamy with lots of mushroom in it.Tempura Platter on Mashcharcoal coated yam, eggplant, apple, banana with Japanese orange sesame dressingIt is the most unique out of the 3 dishes.

The only thing I enjoyed was the hot stone mushroom. It was tasty and the texture surprised me. Presentation wise they all looked pretty. I would go back to accompany my vegetarian friends to eat there.",

    "text": "I freaking love this place. Being a big fan of Dozo before it closed down, I was excited to try Joie the moment I learnt about it. To my surprise, Vegetarian! Lucky I'm not picky. I've been here twice, once with my girlfriend and another with my family and both times I've been quite happy with what I got. Service was awesome. Attentive, funny and entertaining. Friendly and quick, you can't ask more from your service staff at a restaurant. This is the kind of place you bring somebody who is against vegeterian food. Without telling them a thing, most of the dishes would be delivered in a fun way that would make most whip out their cellphones for pictures. The food is great, played smart and really just full of crazy flavours. I personally feel that the Dozo brand has chefs that really understand how a meal should be and have done it right at incredibly affordable prices. Affordable, tasty and worth your time. Give it a go meat-lover, at least once at least. I'm pretty sure you won't regret it!",

    "text": "A very unexpected meal full of surprises. I share the sentiment of the reviewer below in that the food was excellent and made interesting because it was vegetarian. I ate at Joie because my original choice, Kuvo, was only serving a restaurant week menu highlighting some fairly boring dishes. I ventured up Orchard Central and settled on Joie since I recall having positive experiences at their other restaurants - Dozo and the Clan. I can't remember every dish in my meal but I really liked the starter platter that had what I think was a strip of carrot, but with the texture of fish (!), the mushroom \"escargot\" and the nutty wild rice. There are several, obvious crowd pleasers on the menu that are a variation of truffles, cheese and baked pastries, but I would suggest exploring stuff you've never tried/imagined before. It was a truly enjoyable meal. Service, as you would expect from the Dozo team, was fantastic and attentive. The only thing I would say is the waiters could cut back on hand-holding or dumbing down the chef's creations in an effort to \"educate\" their guests. Overall a great meal and it doesn't break the bank. The restaurant is hidden on the 12th floor in what I think is the dumbest mall layout in town. Good luck finding your way up there :)",
