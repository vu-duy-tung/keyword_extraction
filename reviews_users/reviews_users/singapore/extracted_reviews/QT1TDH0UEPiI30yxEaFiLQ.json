    "text": "So, what we have here is a bar where the price of the beers go up and down based upon the sales in proportion with each other. Thus the price of a popular beer goes up, while the least popular beers go down (which is probably why they don't have VB on tap). It's a cute concept, but since I've become a bit of a beer snob I don't let the price of a beer dictate whether I am going to buy it or not (though I have done so in the past). Other than the cute concept of rising and falling beer prices, they aslo ave a decent collection of beers available - I ended up having the strawberry beer, which I have to admit was different.",

There was no one in the bar/restaurant at 6:15-7pm on a Friday night. My Sister and I had to walk around the bear to grab someone to sit us. And again when we wanted to order and the bill.The selection for beers were disappointing even though it was recommended for beer. There is nothing interesting on it's menu other than the way it is displayed like a stock market. We tried the salted egg yolk pizza and chicken wings. \u00a0No salted egg yolk flavour for either. Also the pizza is like a cheap frozen thing you buy from a convenience store. The chicken wings were juicy but the skin was oily and lacks salted egg yolk sauce. I will not come back even if we get free food..",

    "text": "On paper, the idea of Beer Market is a novel one. Like a stock exchange for beers, prices fluctuate according to demand. Sounds brilliant eh? Nope. A cool premise but the execution is all wrong. First off the selection of beers arent exactly extensive. Second, the prices arent cheap in the first place. So the remotely decent beers are perennially expensive. The layout of the place isnt fantastic as well. Feels like a narrow alley with twists and turns. So one you are at one end, its hard to get the attention of the service staff.But its not all bad. Food is relatively decent. And for smokers, you have your own enclosed smoking cubicle within the 'Market'. They also have a pool table and a dedicated darting area with 4 boards. So to me the concept is a fail but the food and darts saves it a star.",

Left around 10pm+ $3 wings are amazing. 4 full wings, cut in half and made with either chill (excellent), honey (good) or crispy-fried (average)- the market is rigged. When we arrived it was empty, so I ordered an Asahi, the next half hour \"update\" almost all the prices went up. Clearly there was no demand for 20+ drinks. We recorded the prices every half hour, and went up on average $2 over the 3 hours - not a stockmarket at all - a scam! (oh wait, that IS a stock market)- the $3 sausage and $3 nachos are terrible - remove them from the menu- the music was too loud. When you can't talk and get deaf, what is the point?",

The stock market concept is meant to appeal to financial-types who have nosh to spend on beer after a long day slogging it out - very clever of the owners of this place! Also, prices shown for the beer is after GST and that makes it easier to calculate the total cost you're paying. But, what I really love about beer market is the fact that Shili and Adi perform here on Thursdays and Fridays. They are an awesome band (disclosure: they're my friends back from Uni days) who have gotten better since going commercial. But, that means those days are typically the most packed and you'd better book in advance before coming.Beware - getting couch seats means you need to spend a minimum of 300. Make sure you're aware of this before taking one that's offered to you",

Cool concept regardless. Might get a higher rating next time if there is a band playing.",

Working like the stock exchange, the prices of the beers fluctuate according to how popular they are. Being an Asahi drinker myself, that is usually all I order once I see it on the menu. Imagine my horror when I saw the price of Asahi nudging towards S$15 when others, such as Chang, stayed stagnant at slightly over S$10. It can be pretty fun to keep track of the price of your favourite beers and strategise your next move, but after a while, the novelty wears off and you barely notice the large screen at the bar. They have a good space for events and those have always been fun. There is space to move around and choose a quiet table towards the back, and the central set-up is conducive for live music acts and talks. Beyond the occasional event, however, there is definitely no motivation to head back and experience one of their regular nights. It just doesn't leave that kind of impression.",

Truth is, alcohol is never that cheap in Singapore so it's more of a novelty. Truth be told I'd rather be drinking at home.The lineup of the bands seem to change plenty here but I've enjoyed watching some pretty good live bands here. The spread of beers here is wide so you'll have a nice selection to choose from.The only downside was that the crowds that go there don't seem to be there for the live music and that's a waste for me. i think this place could have a much more party atmosphere if the crowds were less stiff.",

Beer wise, Beer Market has the usual beer options - Tiger, Erdinger - and carries some less common labels too (e.g. kopparberg cider). Beer Market occasionally has live bands performing as well. Oh, one really convenient feature - it has a smoking room located in the 2nd floor which is rather well ventilated. No more trooping down stairs on unwieldy beer legs for a cigarette anymore!",

My fianc\u00e9 and I walked through Clarke Quay on a Wednesday evening passing up several bars/restaurants that looked great, however I insisted we try Beer Market. When we got there it wasn't busy at all, which we don't mind but should have been our first red flag (especially since everywhere else was so busy). We were seated right away and given menus to look over. After 10 minutes had past we had not been tended to and had been walked past several times. 15 minutes past, then 20 without anyone coming to our table. The staff was busy laughing, texting, and doing everything but providing the excellent service we had grown accustom to in the rest of our stay in Singapore. We left and went to another brewery close by. Skip this place and save your time and money. Extremely disappointed as we had high hopes.",
