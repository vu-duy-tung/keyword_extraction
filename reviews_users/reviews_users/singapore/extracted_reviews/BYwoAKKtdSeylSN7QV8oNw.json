(Let's be honest here, most of the restaurants that have opened up branches in Singapore are disappointments compared to their original location overseas. E.g., Lady M, Din Tai Fung, Tim Ho Wan, Lawrys, etc.) We came for lunch on a weekday, around 11:40, so there was no wait. My pancakes were fluffy and moist, and my friend's country breakfast also looked delicious. My only complaint is with the service, which was rather slow. We had to flag down the server a couple times to order our food, even though the restaurant was only half full. Will def be back again soon!",

I enjoyed the blueberries \u00a0and the sauce with the pancakes which I felt were a good combination. I wished they gave more blueberries because towards the end it started to get pretty dry. The sauce also started to get too sweet once the blueberries finished. But the pancakes were fluffy and tasty. The chicken and waffles were a disappointment. I admit the waffles were done differently and could be subjectively just not up to my taste. But the chicken was poor. Tasteless, kinda soggy and dry. The sweet sauce didn't really go well with this and overall I'm really not a fan of this dish. Ordered the grits as well which was horrible. Could tell they didn't know how to cook cheese & grits and it is not like what it's meant to be like. Very dry and undercooked. Flavourless.. bah horrible. The sausage patty was just. Minced meat smashed & fried? Not what you'd expect. Disappointing because on the menu it said Sausage & Maple.",

    "text": "Being a fan of the pancakes and southern breakfast of the original Clinton St baking company in NYC, we excitedly arranged to meet at this place for brunch to reminisce our old NYC days. Recommendation- just stick to the fried chicken and pancakes. They were tasty and definitely of similar standards to the dishes we had in NYC.. however, what really disappointed us was their 'cheesy grits'. It looked and tasted like oatmeal porridge; and when we tried to tell them that was not definitely not grit, they checked and confirmed it was 'grit' made from 'barley' and they followed the original recipe. Com'on.. if it's not grit, don't insist it is and bullshit us like we are some ignorant customers. I would have accepted a yes sorry it's not easy to find grits and this is what we have used to replace it.. google grit and it is 'Grits is a food made from corn that is ground into a coarse meal and then boiled.' Suggestion to the chef - even polenta has a more similar taste and texture to real grits than whatever you are serving now. Next is the corn bread which has a ginseng taste to it. It happens that my friend liked ginseng and hence liked it.. otherwise I would not recommend you order that either. Spinach was cooked like Chinese style and a bit bland. All in all nice environment but not sure I'll be back for the food.",

Pancakes are typical I felt.I lived in NYC for 5 years and remember my times at Clinton Street Baking Company out there very fondly. I loved everything there, even their pancakes had a very impactful memory that I became jaded to any other pancake. Coming here however, I feel that the pancakes are nowhere near the quality in NYC and even taste pretty typical to any other cafe which is the the only reason for the minus 1 star given how hyped they are.The biscuit breakfast sandwich is the best I've ever had in my life. I was totally wow'd by this here in Singapore and if my review was based on only this, I would have easily given this a resounding 5+ star.Orange juice is fresh as is their coffee. I would recommend that you call ahead and get a reservation. If you show up during the breakfast or lunch (or weekend brunch) hours, you will for sure need to wait the usual 2-3 hours that they mention.Highly recommend but don't come in just for the pancakes!",

    "text": "The Good, The Bad, and The Bourbon Salted Caramel MilkshakeI preface this by saying I absolutely love Clinton Street Baking Co. in New York. The Singapore shop matches the New York venue in some respects (main courses and drinks) and fails in other areas (pies and service).I'll start with the good. For a shop known for its baked goods and pancakes, the drinks were fantastic. \u00a0The bourbon salted caramel milkshake was the best thing we had and the bloody mary, which is so rarely made well, was also delicious. The main courses we tried (pancakes and huevos rancheros) were every bit as good as the NY shop.Unfortunately, there were several areas where Clinton Street really struggled. First, the service was horrible. After we were seated, not one staff member came to our table without being asked. We had to ask for drinks, for menus, to order, to get a dessert menu, to get a check, and to have our check taken and processed. When there were quality issues with food (see below), we did not get an apology and the waiter seemed annoyed to have to deal with the issue.Second, when we arrived for brunch, two of the three pies of the day were unavailable. No explanation was give nor was any apology forthcoming. We tried the only special available (strawberry rhubarb pie) and the lime meringue pie. Both were disappointing. The crumble on the strawberry rhubarb pie was like a group of small, indestructible rocks. We could not break up the 10cm pieces with a fork -- and we tried! We were not provided a knife with dessert. \u00a0The lime meringue pie tasted good but there was so little lime custard except at the very edge of the pie that it tasted almost exclusively of meringue.When I pointed these out to our server he simply asked if we would like something different. I pointed out that there was very little else available as two of the pies of the day were not available and he stood in silence. He did not seem to have any idea how the pies should be made or the quality that is normally associated with Clinton Street.",

    "text": "Tried the much-lauded fried chicken today - the chicken and waffles and chicken plate. Didn't like the way the chicken was prepared for the waffles (boneless fillets with a thin batter) as it was rather dry. Chicken plate was VERY generous with literally half a chicken on the plate, along with a decent chunk of corn bread and small token coleslaw. The batter on the chicken plate was better, buttermilk, and had a good crunch. Unfortunately, it was either bad / old oil or the oil was too hot, but ultimately had a burnt and slightly acrid flavour. The flavour and seasoning wasn't great either so I found it rather plain overall. I'd go back for a shake or some of the desserts, and maybe give the pancakes another shot. All the other tables' food looked well prepared and equally generous, so value for money is decent (by Singapore standards for these sort of establishments). Service was clinical and efficient without being particularly friendly. \u00a0Venue itself was quite cramped with tables extremely close to each other. I went to the original store in NYC, and was not that impressed by it either. Thankfully the ludicrous hype has died down and we got a table with no issues on a Sunday at 1pm.",

I would've preferred plain maple syrup to the maple butter and would've liked more blueberries on top but there was a decent number of blueberries in the pancakes themselves.Spanish scramble - 4 starsAn omelette with chorizo and caramelized onions. Well done.The brunch dishes taste better than those over at Wild Honey though Wild Honey is more conveniently located. I'd pick this one if I were picking based on food alone.Update 17 Apr 2017Black Angus Cheeseburger ($23++=$27) - 3 stars3.5-0.5 stars for the price (I like my math apparently). Everything on the burger - the caramelized onions, the cheese was good, and the meat itself was juicy but BLAND. I got it medium and it was still kinda red and oozed... The fries were mediocre - salty and crispy but again the taste wasn't great. The slaw was alright. I appreciated the pickle! Overall okay...Wifi only for phones. They won't type it in for your tablet or laptop.4 stars for the ambience. Nice bright and roomy.",

Friends loved the food, particularly the blueberry pancakes and the buttermilk biscuit sandwich. I had the chicken and waffle; I would prefer if the chicken was more deep fried and crispy, though the waffle was tasty with the maple butter. The Angus cheeseburger looked delightful and we particularly enjoyed the very tasty fries. Portions were satisfying and we barely had space for desserts - could only make room for 3 pancakes amongst a party of 6. The bill was about $30 per person. I had made reservations by phone which was painless, though I wish they have an online option. It's interesting that's not available, considering the reservation confirmation was done via an automated system. We'll be back again to try more of their desserts.",

I've heard lots of excited rumblings of course, and friends who used to live in New York were thrilled about its opening. Fair enough. From all accounts, I hear that this place largely works. The food is comparable and all. I'll have to take their word for it. I only came here for some cake and I got the upside down pineapple cake. I don't know why but seeing a badly sliced and sloppily presented cake annoyed me. It shows a lack of care in the attentive-level of staff.When I went to pay, I noticed that other cakes (of other flavors) were similarly badly sliced. Woah. I really did think Clinton St Bakery was better than this. Taste-wise, the cake was fine. Not great, not terrible. The staff was sufficiently polite. But I think the devil's in the details and they need to teach their staff how to slice cakes properly, lift the slices and place them on plates.",

Unfortunately it was after a visit to Katz (and if you've seen the size of their pastrami sandwiches you'd know how stuffed I was at that time) so all I had was the bacon and it didn't leave much of an impression then.FAST FORWARD TO 5 YEARS LATER! And Clinton Street Baking Co is now in SUNNY (hazy) SINGAPORE!They don't take reservations, and we were here on a sunday morning, and the queue was 1.5 hours. By the time it was our turn to be seated it was 2 hours. Be warned that the queue is deceptively short because everyone just gives their handphone number and goes away while waiting. There are some red benches to sit on outside the shop but it could fit a maximum of 8 people. 2 yummy mummy-types tried to cut the queue (\"why don't we tell them that we have a baby?\"). To which I said. \"IS THE BABY GOING TO BE EATING THE FOOD HERE???\")My question was answered when I made the mistake of ordering the cheese grits. A mush in a plate, it tasted as good as it looked. Which was not at all. I'd rather some mashed potatoes. Even the powdered ones that you get from 7-11.Other sides were good but not impressive. We had the southern chicken (skin was yums), the scrambled eggs with salmon (not baaaaad), and some farmer's platter. Like, good but I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes for them.BUT THE STANDOUT WERE THE PANCAKES. 3 flavors - blueberry, banana, chocolate - to choose from. You can add 1 more flavour for $2. Same pancakes, different toppings. These were nice and fluffy and thick yet light. I think the only other place in Singapore that comes close so far is Skyve. If you put the pancakes from those 2 places together and made me choose 1, I don't know which would win. But maybe Clinton Street because of that wonderful maple syrup/butter mix, which married the taste of maple syrup with the smoothness of melted butter.Come here! Unless you're a yummy mummy with a baby trying to cut the queue -_-\"",

My husband and I were in Singapore for a couple of days and we both like our meals to be delicious. So my husband found this place mostly because they have good pancakes (based on the reviews he read) and we decided to give it a try. We both ordered our pancakes with chocolate chunks. When the waiter brought the pancakes to our table, they looked like regular pancakes. However, the moment I drizzled the buttered maple syrup on top of the fluffy round edges of my pancake, I immediately knew that this one is going to be one of the best I ever had. And I was right. The buttered maple syrup was so darn good to the point that without it, the pancake would not taste this incredible. My husband loved it and so did I. Glad we gave it a try. Now I think you should.",

I believe they are one of the best pancakes I have ever tasted. They are hot, fluffy and the chocolate chip are melted inside them. Plus the pancakes are hot such that the chocolate chip sprinkled above them can easily melt. Other than the perfect pancakes the maple syrup that comes with it is also perfect. It's not your average maple syrup.",

The portions were more than generous (though still not as massive as the portions in the States), the food quality was pretty good as well!I had the Farmer's platter (or breakfast, can't remember the exact title now), and I loved how well the eggs were done; slightly runny, just to my liking. \u00a0Everything was a little sweet (as if coated with maple syrup), but I think it blended well together. I would definitely get the pancakes the next time I visit this place; the Nutella one looked AWESOME!Just to throw some caution; they're pretty strict on reservations. Also, they only can confirm a reservation of up to 6 pax, any more they can't confirm/have to walk in.",

    "text": "I came here because the hotel breakfast at the Intercontinental was $S30 a pop, and I thought I could do better -- or at least the same for less. So I decided to go to Killiney Kopitiam but my Ang Moh instincts took over while passing the lower-rated Clinton Street Baking Co. They had muffins on display and I am partial to Western breakfasts. So I was sucked in. The first thing I saw from the menu was it was not going to be much less expensive. So maybe it'll be great? Same for more?I ordered what I thought was their signature omelette because it had their name on it. But it only comes with two add-in ingredients (besides the eggs, of course). And apparently nothing but those two plus the eggs because when the omelette arrived I was asked if I wanted salt, pepper, or catsup. The first sign of cooking mediocrity is the need to season it with any of those things after cooking, especially a $20 omelette. If I'd known I would have chosen bacon to go in there. Ugh. It was so bland. And dry. I regretted not asking for catsup. I regretted more not having salsa, which is the best cure for bland eggs.The hash browns, though, were remarkable. If it was a two-egg omelette instead of a three-egger I was pushing through I would have savored them more. My cappuccino was also well done. Final tally, $S33!At the hotel I could have bottomless juice, cappuccinos, an array of Japanese, Chinese, Indian, and Western breakfast items. Smoked salmon with capers. Fresh-made waffles. Croissants and danishes. Fresh fruit. I got less for more. I'm kind of amazed they didn't have oatmeal (or porridge) on the menu. My punishment for not going to the kopitiam.",

    "text": "By far the best Western style breakfast/brunch I've ever had in Singapore. I highly recommend the blueberry pancakes and the hash brown.Came in a party of 2. Noting the portions of the people around, we ordered a blueberry pancake, a hash brown, and a two eggs, any style, which we chose scrambled. The blueberry pancakes - extremely fluffy, not at all dry, with a fragrance that reminds me of nice waffles, which on its own is already worth a 4/5. Comes with the blueberry sauce which unlike typical jam-type of sauce, is not too sweet, but somewhat tart, very refreshing. Also comes with a small cup of maple butter. Oh the brilliance. Saves you the trouble of spreading the butter, an extremely cumbersome process. The maple butter is not too sweet, with a flavour that is surprisingly not too heavy, somewhat reminiscent of caramel, and has a nice amber fragrance to it. These 3 items eaten together is heavenly. So overall a 5/5 for this dish, without a shadow of doubt. Portion to us is too large for 1 person. Maybe closer to 1.5 persons for typical Singaporean breakfast portioning. The scrambled eggs, well done, nice butter fragrance, nothing spectacular compared to the other 2 dishes. 4/5.The has brown, oh the hash brown. Drenched in buttery goodness, with a mix of smooth mashed potatoes, chunky potatoes and some portions that are fried crispy. Plain, simple goodness made to perfection. This to me overtakes the well done rosti at Marche as the best rendition of a potato dish. 5/5. All in all I am impressed. I'm not even sure why some people complain about the prices. It appears expensive, yes but that reflects the portion they are serving. Bring friends along to share and the prices are extremely reasonable. Coupled with the brilliant quality, this is a no-brainer. Never had a western style breakfast that truly impressed me in Singapore. This is the first.",

    "text": "Located in the middle of Purvis Street, is this cafe called Clinton Street Baking Company. Its main outlet is in New York, United States. It is well known for its pancake and is known as \"New York's # 1 breakfast spot\" by Lonely Planet, as well as, \"Best Pancakes\" by New York Magazine (twice). The place was decorated in a traditional, clean cut look.The usual menu was presented in a booklet.Besides the usual menu, there is daily special items on the board,as well as, dinner special items.Boozy Salted Caramel ($15++ left)vanilla ice cream, bourbon, salted caramel sauceWithout alcohol ($10++ right)Pretty strong in the alcohol. The drink tasted very rich and creamy, but could not taste the salted caramel in it.Crab Cakes ($15++)Two crab cakes, served with classic remoulade, and house slaw.The crab cake was moist and creamy inside with chunks of crab meat in it.Chicken & Waffles ($21++)with honey-Tabasco sauce, a crispy Belgian vanilla buttermilk waffle, and signature warm maple butter.The chicken was served char burnt, which made one quite disappointed. Some parts of the batter was just too hard and bitter to be eaten. One had to remove the batter coating in order to eat. Although the staff saw that we had left much of the batter untouch when clearing the plates, no one asked us about the food. The waffle was not the usual crispy and fluffy type. Instead it was eggy and soft. More like kueh kueh type. Not bad with the maple butter sauce. But not really my type.Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter ($18++)Served with wild blueberries.The first which I notice when the dish was served, was that the pancakes were super thick in size. The pancake was fluffy and soft, with a kind of eggy taste. Some may felt that the blueberries was a bit too sour. Nice but could not take in more a piece of pancake. It was way too much for me.Overall felt that the food was overrated. Maybe I was expecting too much but it just did not blow me off. Although the place looked sparkling clean, I was surprised to see a certain small animal running through the dining area. No wonder the place had placed a notice that it would be closed early for maintenance on the coming Monday. I soon lost my appetite after that and trying to vomit everything out.",

    "text": "To summarize it all in a word, pancakes. EAT the pancakes.Clinton St Baking Co. of Manhattan's Lower East Side finally lands in Singapore with a huge splash, with glowing reviews in the island's English language broadsheet, and features on TV.Stepping inside, the dining room successfully recreates that typical American diner feel, similar to the original in NY (but definitely much newer).The entrees were decently good, but I'd recommend the pancakes above everything else. Fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside, paired with a sinful maple-butter sauce that's just amazing as it is calorific. Blueberry, banana walnut or chocolate chunk, they're all good. The house brew is drip coffee, and refills are free!They had a couple of Southern offerings on the menu, but IMO they were Northern interpretations of Southern food. I liked that the buttermilk fried chicken had cornmeal in the batter, however the batter lost its crunchiness rather quickly and fell off the chicken before you had a chance to bite it. Conclusion, stick to the pancakes.They don't take reservations, and weekend brunch lines are an hour wait or more. To avoid the crowds, I recommend coming in on a weekday, or late in the afternoon on a weekend, or heading for the pastry & coffee takeout counter instead.It's been a while since I was back in Manhattan, and I personally have not been to the original on Clinton St (there, I heard the lines are an hour long too), but comparing this to other brunch type places in Singapore they pretty much come out tops. 3 if this is a place in the US, 4 cos it's in Singapore.",

    "text": "I recently had a pancake craving and with all the hype surrounding this place, I just had to check it out for myself.Popped in here on a weekday, late afternoon, and there was no queue. The place had about 7 people, so you may want to try your luck instead of the horrendous weekend queues. There are some benches outside if you should so feel inclined to wait with the crowds.The Bellini flavors are seasonal here, and on that day, it happened to be strawberry. Yum! Prosecco and fruit; can't go wrong! I got the banana walnut pancakes, and oh my, were they delicious. The pancakes came, topped with fresh banana, and crunchy walnuts, and some sugar sprinkled for extra crunch. Crisp exterior with a fluffy interior with more banana and walnuts within, coupled with their gorgeous maple syrup-butter sauce... One vessel of sauce is not enough for 3 large pancakes, so I got another. It cost me $2 but oh well, I didn't come to Clinton St Baking Co. to be a stingy person. A friend told me you can change the flavor of one of the pancakes for an extra $2, if I am not wrong. I also got the cheese grits, and ye, it tastes like a savory oatmeal with cheese. Very regular. Service was prompt, but I guess a true test of the waitstaff is peak hours, which I obviously did not get to see.Would return for the pancakes. Or maybe to try the chicken and waffles.P.S. Amex not accepted here.",

    "text": "If you're after a substantial American style breakfast or brunch Clinton Street Baking Co is a decent option. The servings are massive, just like in The States, but the prices reflect the portion size. They have a lot of the classics here; pancakes, eggs on toast, a big breakfast etc. I thought they might have more baked goods on offer in the display cabinet given the business name, but there were just a few scones and muffins. I opted for the smoked salmon scrambled eggs and was not disappointed.",

Sat at the counter and ate which gave me a front row seat to the controlled chaos of servers flying around picking up orders and ringing up customers. The service could have been better - no one spoke to me after I ordered to check on the food or pour more coffee and I had to ask for the check. \u00a0Had the chicken and waffles which was quite good, especially with their green jalape\u00f1o based hot sauce. Add the maple butter and you're good to go. I agree with another review that the waffle could have been a little more well done, especially to support the fried chicken but still worth getting. Will definitely be back for those pancakes.",
