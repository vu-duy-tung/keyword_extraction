    "text": "Fantastic fresh fish! \u00a0Visiting from my current abode in a land of dubious food preparation, fresh seafood was definitely high on my list when visiting Singapore.Simple high-quality sushi and sashimi. \u00a0That's what I wanted, and that's what I got. \u00a0Sake, Hamachi, Hotate, Madai, Unagi--all very tasty. \u00a0I did play with the rolls a little bit, trying a Dragon Roll in one visit (enormous) and a Foie Gras roll in another (interesting) though the basic fish is the star.The atmosphere is brightly lit, vibrant, and open. \u00a0They open early for lunch and fill up by about noon--it seems a popular place. \u00a0They did have the sushi conveyer belt and while I sat at one for a few moments, I felt the stuff going by wasn't the best of their offerings, so I just ordered off the menu.",

    "text": "I love Kuriya Dining! It's my default dining destination if I happen to be at Great World CIty and have some time to spare. A meal at Kuriya is to be enjoyed at leisure, to rush through it would do neither you nor the chef justice. We got the edamame (really fresh and plump), selection of sushi (very fresh) and some yakitori items (grilled prawn, scallop and wagyu beef), king crab (sweet but a bit difficult to extract) with plum sauce, uni egg rice in claypot (seasonal item), dobinmushi (really tasty) and chawanmushi (really smooth) Everything was absolutely delicious, though I prefer the king crab at Hide Yamamoto.Service was really good and our server even offered to scrap the burnt parts of the uni egg rice for us if we liked. They also called to remind us of our reservation and the last order time, and were very lovely about it when we apologised for running late. Will definitely return!",

    "text": "Easily one of the best Japanese restaurants in Singapore. Although a little on the pricey side, Kuriya knows how to serve up authentic and seasonal Japanese cuisine. Sashimi here is cut to perfection both in length and width ensuring adequate taste and portion. Wasabi here is grated fresh from the root and if you're lucky enough you just might get the end of the root to grate on your own when you request for more wasabi. A long time favorite on the menu and a personal favorite of mine would be the Miso Wagyu Beef which is served over a mini wooden Japanese stove. The beef grills atop a special kind of leaf which further enhances the flavor and visual experience. If you are lucky enough, do try the Matcha or green tea creme brulee \u00a0which is out of this world tasty! It is a rare treat indeed, sometimes only with seasonal menus but it doesn't hurt to check with your server!",

The feature here I think is the beef, which we had in a variety of settings, from donburi to grilled to shabu shabu style. The quality of the Wagyu was just amazing, which was extremely tender and had the right beef flavor. The raw fish items were fresh and pretty good quality, but I've had better and paid a lot less. The service was top notch however, and the server was extremely friendly and had a nice conversation with us.",
