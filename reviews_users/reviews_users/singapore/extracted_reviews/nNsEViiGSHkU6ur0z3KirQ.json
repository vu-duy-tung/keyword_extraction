    "text": "Food: The hummus was smooth and creamy and definitely the best I've had in Singapore so far. Salad and vine leaves were also delicious and tasted very fresh. Only downside was the falafel was over-fried.Service: Waitress was prompt to come take my order after I sat down on one of the bar seats outside. Wait for food also wasn't too bad. Even though I was the only one sitting outside, I didn't feel neglected at all. Unlike most places in Singapore, note that the menu prices already include GST and service charge is discretionary. (I overheard a customer complain that the meal was expensive and the waitress had to explain why.)",

The Moutabal Baba Ghanouj (cold mezza hummus) was good but it was hard to taste the grilled eggplant and tasted like the classic hummus with a hint of lemon. They also had Interesting mediterranean dessert selections displayed that you can order to dine or take away. Note: self-service for water so no service charge was credited!",

The savoury drink was so salty my wife couldn't take more than a sip (we've had this drink in many places before). Worse yet, it was expensive. Don't bother.",

Other prices have followed the same ratio.Food however is good. had the kibbeh, arayes and lamb kebab. All are tastefully done. But its the price that is going to make me think twice before I go there again.",

Whereas other Middle Eastern places cost 20% more. Also, water is served for free.Everything tastes really good. We like the hummos, it is very smooth. Hummos with garlic is excellent. The sampler mezza platter is a good way to try a lot of things. \u00a0They also have pita pizzas, wraps, and more fancy entrees. We usually stick to the appetizers because they have such variety.",

    "text": "Had a light lunch at Urban Bites today. Fairly standard sterile lunch bar d\u00e9cor, service wasn't great and wasn't bad, food was pretty decent. Appreciate that the breads are baked in a stone oven and the baba ghanoush had the right amount of smokiness. I had a chicken wrap which wasn't over-impressive in either size or contents but still filled the gap. The grilled chicken was perfectly cooked although, not a whole lot off it. There were some tomatoes, pickles and a garlic sauce that lingered on my breath for hours afterwards! Unfortunately there were no banana and chocolate crepes that day so we left without dessert, however the cabinet was well stocked with Mediterranean treats including baklava, Turkish delight, nougat etc. The menu seems perfect for sharing with an a multitude of cold and hot mezze items, pizza, salad, and more substantial meals. Would go back if I'm ever craving Mediterranean.",
