We order 2 main - beef & shrimp fajita and salmon with rice. \u00a0When the food came I was very disappointed, the shrimps were frozen type and all the condiment were so little for 4 serving of fajitas. \u00a0This dish is listed at $30 and I was astonished at food quality of such high price, although I am getting a promotional deal but still no excuse. Salmon with rice was of a decent size but salmon was completely burned so we had to scrape off the top layer ...Service wise was also disappointing, since it was early hour of their operation, there were 2-3 servers but I had to look for them 3 times to get what I want (get a seat, take order, get a spoon). Maybe it was the beginning of operation hour but if they were encouraging customer to show up before 12 noon then they ought to educate their staff or provide them with more support... In short it was a very unpleasant and disappointing experience... No excuse for serving sub-standard food even when you offer discount. \u00a0I won't be coming back or going go any other chilli's chain stores in Singapore.",

It was so hot I had to give it to my husband to finish eating. You'd think they'd note that on the menu somehow. I mean, it's got chilis, so I expect some heat. But my-mouth-is-on-fire-please-call-the-ambulance hot? I was not expecting. Of course, my husband loved it. I just would have appreciated a heads-up is all!On my second visit, I ordered one of the steaks. Perfectly cooked. Not too much fat. And great flavor!There's also free wifi if you want to ignore the people who were kind enough to meet you for dinner.Expect a crowd after 7pm, especially on a weekend. But even when the place was packed, the service was pretty good by Singapore standards!",

One puzzling thing though: the glassware is plastic and I've never had this experience in any US location! \u00a0It was a weeknight so not sure whether they thought we'd get rowdy...?We ordered the guacamole to start - it came with a small dish of salsa as well. \u00a0Both were just okay, but SO COLD that they clearly just came out of the fridge - Chili's, it's fine if you pre-make your guac, but at least make a bit more of an effort to hide that fact!Then we got the chili cheese fries - this was the BEST thing we ate the whole evening! Fries laden with chili, sauce, cheese and jalapenos, served with a very American (aka deliciously artificial) ranch sauce for dipping.The main course was a huge disappointment - the short rib steak was very bland, despite loads of pickled onions on top. \u00a0The Santa Fe quesadillas were a huge portion, and distinctly average.We did order a side of 'skillet mac and cheese' - this is by far the most disappointing pasta dish I've had in the country! \u00a0The macaroni were overcooked, and swimming in a thin layer of watery yellow sauce! \u00a0The boxed stuff gives thicker sauces than what was on that 'skillet.' \u00a0Also, not using real cheese kind of defeats the purpose of serving food on a skillet, since it just stays a melted goopy mess!Credit to them, they took the mac and cheese off our bill - but really Chili's...how hard is it to throw in some butter and real cheese?!",

This branch is perfectly located in Tanglin Mall, aka the foreigner mall (and dare I say it... The white people's mall. I mean it in a nice way!)I don't come here often, but I will admit that when I do, I truly feel like I'm back home in the suburbs of Houston. The decor, signage, and menus are the exactly the same as the US version. They show American sports on the TVs. They make a huge ruckus when they sing the birthday song. The only differences I've noticed are the beers on tap (Tiger instead of Bud) and slight changes in ingredients. What I mean by this is that the rice isn't exactly Mexican style, as it was green instead of orange-y. I think they used a cilantro pur\u00e9e to season it. In other words, the ingredients are similar but the flavor focus is different.The portions are still hearty, and yes, they do have the baby back baby back baby back riiiiiiibs (BBQ SAUCE!) so that makes me happy. Only thing is you really pay for it. I would expect to spend about $25 a person, excluding alcohol and dessert.As this is a chain, I'd normally rate this 3 stars, but since it's not as ubiquitous as McDonald's, KFC, etc. and they remind me so much of home, I'll bestow 4 stars this time around.",

But when the first outlet at Tanglin Mall arrived on our shores, I made it a point to check it out. Call it typical Singaporean behaviour to flock to new restaurants but I'm glad I did.Although it is ordinary American fare much like Applebee's, it lends a nostalgia of dining at an American sports bar. Dipping buffalo wings into the blue cheese dip while watching American football on the TV screens and knocking back a Budweiser, I love the experience. I might even order a Tex-Mex appetizer or two for good measure.Having said that, since I love Chili's more for the experience than the food, if you were like me, you would do well to regulate your visits here just so you keep it somewhat special and novel while it lasts.",

The taste and quantity wasn't exactly worth the amount of money paid. The beef fajita came in a fair portion but was a little too much for the four pieces of pitas that came with it. The meat was a on the dry side and was a little bland. The meat just didn't absorb the flavours from the sauce. The beef burger didn't meet my expectations. Having paid more than $20 for the dish., I expected something that was out of the ordinary. Despite the promising pictures and descriptions of a juicy and thick patty, the actual dish was nothing close to it. The burger itself was considered small for such beef patty burgers, and the patty was pretty dry as well. We also tried the cookies and cream milkshake, which I'm definitely not a big fan of. Instead of being thick and creamy, it was like a watered down version of how it was supposed to taste like. However, service at the outlet was prompt and the staff were friendly and eager to help. They are able to provide recommendations and explanations for our questions. If you're looking for a place to have a family meal or gathering with friends, Chilli's has the perfect atmosphere for such events. But for the taste and price, it's not a place that I'll be craving for any time soon. But I'll probably give it another chance just to see if I'll change my mind about it.",

I have only been to this outlet once but it is pretty much the same and just as good as the one at Sentosa that I usually go to. I always order the fajitas. A sizzling hotplate with the meat of your choice cooked in onions and this incredible sauce is brought out with fresh tomatoes, guacamole, greated cheese, shredded lettuce and sour cream, as well as a couple of wraps. Just the look of it makes my mouth water and it is really fun to wrap your own fajita too. The burgers are also pretty decent and the sides are usually rather big, like the tostada chips and cheese fries. I have no idea what truly authentic mexican food is but if it's anything like what I get at Chili's then I think I'll fall in love with Mexico. The only thing that didn't go so well that night was that the beer from the tap that they gave to my sister was flat, and when she requested for a change, it was still the same. However, they accepted the return of her beer quite graciously and didn't charge us for it. I would definitely be back again.",

    "text": "Located in Tanglin mall, to my surprise, you would find the shopping mall almost empty but the restaurant is buzzling with customers. This restaurant has a woody interior design and the service level is good. The waiter and waitress are proactive to suggest and take your orders.You can try the chicken and ribs combo, serving can be too big for one person, chicken is juicy and flavoured with cheese while the ribs were cooked just right. One of the disappointed was the beef that my friend ordered. It was dry perhaps overcookedAlso, the chocolate lava cake is a queen. You would not want to miss this dessert. It is sweet , with chocolate flowing down the cake. Price is average, similar to any restaurant you can find out there. Certainly a place worth revisiting.",

She always refilled our ice tea when its low. we ordered beef fajitas (big portion and delish), steak and cheese quasadia ( delish also), beef chilli soup (the best chilli ever), warm brownies sunday with vanilla ice cream (big and full of yummyness. The brownies r amazingly soft in the inside). Will be eating here again for sure",
