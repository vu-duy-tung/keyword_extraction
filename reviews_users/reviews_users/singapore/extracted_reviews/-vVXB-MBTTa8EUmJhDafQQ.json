There was a picture of a huge chicken (their signature roasted chicken) outside the restaurant so that roped me in haha plus they have an open kitchen which is always appealing to the eye.The roasted chicken was just delicious! Nice and juicy; including corn on the cobb, potatoes, carrots, onions - casual french food done right. After not having fries for like two weeks, their fries were great :)Also ordered the 17 hour braised beef with mashed potatoes and this was not so good. The beef was tough and nothing compared to the chicken. Would not recommend ordering even though the presentation was nice.Get the chicken and you'll be happy - portions are a good size for french food so don't necessarily need to over order. Try their drinks - they look IG worthy!",

    "text": "So been to several other outlets of this French sounding named restaurant. The first time years ago had lumps and lumps of un-melted soup granules ( like those you see in cup-a-soup). At least this shop served without those granules. Overall the soup was salty.The roasted chicken was tender and moist, but the white sauce was rather bland. Probably compared to the salty soup.Ordered side of curly fries and the buttered rice. The rice was good but at 2.50 for a small cup was rather expensive.The dessert creme bulee, the egg contents was like 2 egg tarts but sells for the price of a dozen.Overall rather expensive for a \"cheap\" French style food.BTW, found no reference of this restaurant chain in France.",

I enjoyed it until the last bit.I tried their Roast Chicken with the signature Mushroom sauce, the special limited edition (during CNY) Mandarin Orange sauce, and their tangy sweet Cranberry sauce. \u00a0All three are AWESTRUCK-YUMMY!!! \u00a0And I figured that many others might have posted the photos of the shroom & cranberry sauce ones, I posted the photo of the limited edition Mandarin Orange sauce during my visit last time in CNY. \u00a0Oh...how I wish they will repeat this very special orderagain! \u00a0It was perfect! \u00a0XDBut hey, the other sauce and dish they have are exceptionally good as well, so I am still a fan of this French chicken! \u00a0Just one comment tho, they should give a bit more of those green leaves on the plate. \u00a0\"More Green, please!\" \u00a0Tried the Escargot, Mushroom soup, Sauted wild Mushroom too, and I enjoyed them as well. \u00a0And, Last but no least, \u00a0there's a reason why people say, \"There's always room for DESSERT!\" (ahem) \u00a0Yes. \u00a0ze' TIRAMISU.I'm done for. Love it. \u00a0Totally. \u00a0Wow. ahahahhaOh yes, and the Creme brulee, is ok.I choose T-I-R-A-M-I-S-U. \u00a0Yeah.Overall, worth a visit!",

    "text": "My first time in Singapore and I was trying to eat locally, but after a few days I really needed something simple and familiar. Enter their base entree the roasted chicken with a mushroom sauce and steamed vegetables. The steamed veggies were just average but we're simple and just what I needed. The chicken was absolutely moist and the sauce was just right. I tried the \"on special\" lemon sauce on my second visit and it was just ok.The service was average but they always said \"Bonjour\" when a new group came in which was slightly annoying. Guess its there thing.",

We waited with rumbling stomachs, but Lady Luck was on our side and we got a seat (mainly because we came as a pair)As I sat and waited for my food, I had this sudden familiar feeling. Like I've been to this restaurant before.And yes I think I have. It feels like an upmarket kenny rogers or a French astons.Sitting next to the walkway didn't help too, as people kept gawking at my meal and probably judging me as I'm a messy eater. Note to self, sit in boothI chose the french onion soup and Poulet d cranberry - chicken doused in cranberry brown sauce and Dijon mustard. The french soup is better than the average soups you would meet. Nice and plenty of onions ...was I being too much as I \u00a0craved for melted cheese on top of my soup? And came the chicken.chicken was nice and tender, the gravy was the usual brown sauce with the cranberry.I'm not gonna rave much nor knock it down. Its alright.The price isn't extravagant. The chicken was good and enough for 2 (I ordered half mind you)I still think Charlie Ts chickens are better though.",

Will come again to try the other dishes!",
