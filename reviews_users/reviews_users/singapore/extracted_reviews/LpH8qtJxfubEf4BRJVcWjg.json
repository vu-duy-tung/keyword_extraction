Crispy skin, quite a generous portion of chicken though the meat was a tad too dry. I liked the accompaniment - kang kong, sliced cucumber, fried tofu, tempeh and the fried crispy bits. The chili was very spicy, go easy on it if you are not used to the fiery heat. The sayur asem was also pretty good, a bit reminiscent of my childhood, where this sour vegetables soup was a common fixture during meal times. Being a warung, do not expect it to be full of ingredients which would be in your home version. I didn't see any melinjo or young jackfruit in the bowl I had. The disappointment I had was in the iced milo I ordered. It was so diluted I thought I was just drinking slightly sweetened water. It looked so pale that you would think it was iced milk tea on the table. Note:kecap manis (sweet dark soy) and chili are also available at the counter near the kitchen if you need it.",

So of course we came here for Ayam Penyet! Finding this place is a little tricky for us as tourists but after we located Lucky Plaza and wandered around a little and here we were ready to eat!Ayam Penyet and some refreshing iced cold drinks (lime juice/teh botol sorso) really hit the spot. Even as someone that is not a fan of Deep Fried chicken I enjoyed all the hot sauces and spices in this dish. The chicken though a little dry, maybe because we were not eating at peak hour??!Since I cannot find the same dish where I live.. there are NO good and authentic Indonesian food in Toronto.... I guess I would come back again next time I am in town.PS Why was my Yelp Friend kept sticking his tongue out at me while eating?",

The chicken was a bit dry for my liking and not enough crunch to it. The chili \u00a0sauce on the other hand was bold, spicy, and had a kick that made my ears ring. It was addicting though so I couldn't really stop myself from drenching my chicken and rice with it.Will I be back for more? Probably. But does it compare to the Ali Corner stall at the Tiong Bahru Market? Nope. Ali Corner for life!",

This Indonesian chain has the legitimate spiciness with a hot sauce that can be eaten with all foods. The place itself seems pretty old and dirty. You sit down and get tossed a paper menu you check for the ordering as well as a laminated picture menu. Careful, the numbers on the paper don't match the menu!!!Once you finish checking, you go to the front and pay for the food and it gets brought to you. The food is delish!!! the beefball rice noodle soup was soooo good and the smashed chicken was cooked just right with so much flavour. I also enjoyed the veggies that it came with. For $6.90 a dish, this place does not let you down. The lime juices are also a good pairing for the spiciness, but just beware that it's a little on the sweet side.",

Food is served nicely on a separate plate to ease sharing. The fish is butterflied off the bone and fried to stand upright on the plate. Quite interesting to see a fish standing by itself. Suggest you order a cold drink to temper the burn of the chilli.",

Dinners are an absolute nightmare to have so it's always lunch here for me when I get bored of the standard chicken rice and am looking for something with a kick! The chicken is tender and juicy most of the times, and the fried skin and crumbs taste great with the rice. If you don't like your meat dry, avoid getting the breast meat, and go for the thighs instead. Portion wise, chicken is great, just that the rice can be too small a portion sometimes. The chilli is what keeps people coming back here, and if packs a powerful punch. Drinks are definitely a must have before you start tucking in, or you'll end up with a dinner table where no one can talk as everyone is too busy taking care of their burning tongues!",

Those who can't shouldn't even bother with the chilli as it's guaranteed to leave even the most battle-hardened chilli fans gasping for breath.Served with a piece of tauhu and tempeh goreng, the highlight of this dish is the balacan-chilli that's left precariously on the sides of the chicken in a cute wooden plate. The ayam penyet (flattened chicken) here is moist and the skin is nicely deep fried and is rather large! I like the fact that the meat shreds off the bones easily.The crumbs are packed with flavour, but sometimes they come with too little. You can always try asking for more and they'll usually oblige if there isn't a large crowd. They don't serve ice water here, so make sure you have your drink before you start digging in or you're going to have a really bad time when the chilli kicks in.",

Her face remained emotionless but we could see her eyes tearing up. This is the Ayam Penyet restaurant that Lucky Plaza's famous for. Most of the spices here are imported from Indonesia, so you can tell they mean business. I like the environment of this shop. There's no rushed feel of the kopitiams where you'll usually find Ayam Penyets. Plus, it's cleaner and more comfortable too. My favourite drinks here are the avocado juice or the delightfully pink happy soda (soda gembira). They are both sweet and thick, icy goodness to complete a sinful meal.",
