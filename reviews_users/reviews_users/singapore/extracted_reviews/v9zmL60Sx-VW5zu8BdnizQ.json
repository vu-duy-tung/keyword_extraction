    "text": "Despite its popularity, I hadn't been to Ramen Santouka until yesterday. In search of ramen places around Somerset, I led a friend from overseas to Ramen Santouka. He had long heard of the numerous delicious ramen places in Singapore and was more than eager to try it out. I had the shin-aji shoyu ramen, one of the specialties listed at the back, while he had the kurobuta miso ramen with an additional side order of edamame. The service was not very good. The waitress could not understand our order, and ordered our meals wrongly. Luckily, another waitress came along and realized that she was having difficulties finding the ramens on her list and helped her. There was no friendliness or apologies, or friendly apologies. The bill came up to $50 , half of which was due to the Kurobuta, so it was considerably less expensive than other ramen places. As for the taste, I liked the ramen noodle and its springy texture, but although the soup was not bad, I didn't think it was exceptional, compared to other ramen places available. The chashu meat also tasted strange. There was a not-very-pleasant pork taste to it that I've never experienced in other ramen places before. If I'm looking for a good ramen, Santouka would not be my first choice unless I was in the area and possibly very hungry.",

    "text": "In the hour long queue to get a table I had come up with several theories as to Santouka's ramen infamy, one of them being that the longer the queue, the longer the wait, the hungrier you get, the tastier it tastes. How true this is, I may never know, but all this conjecturing was forgot the moment we got our hands on the menu - our mouths were literally watering by the prospect of what we might get.This being my first visit, I decided to go for the safe, recommended option, which was this $14 ramen set that mixed a salt, soy bean and soy sauce broth, complete with two tender sizeable slices of pork and the most perfectly cooked egg in which the white just about made the grade for 'hard boiled', but the yolk could still remain in the class for 'soft', leaving you with the most wonderful feeling in your mouth. At the side was a bowl of Japanese sticky rice, topped with crispy fried bits (of flour) the size of peppercorns - it was then explained that this was meant to be mixed with the broth when the noodles were finished, which I thought was the most fantastic idea! The taste did not let me down - the most delish bowl of Japanese rice porridge, if there ever was such a thing. The set then comes complete with a nice cup of tea, which worked out to be the perfect ending to a good good meal.I knicked a slice or two of pork cheeks from my friends, who ordered the 'Choice Pork Ramen'. I must admit that I had such high expectations of it, having read its description over and over again in the age-long queue to get seated, and so finding out that there was only 200-300g of this bit in each pig, so the meat is precious, and its texture comparable to the fatty tuna bits (which are so ridiculously pricey!!). The cheeks were great. If I don't sound convincing, it is because I wasn't, not after all that hype. Yes it could literally melt in my mouth, especially the wonderfully fatty bits (girls - don't throw this away!!!), but I found it a little too salty around the darker brown edges. Perhaps also by the time my friends got round to offering me a slice they had got fairly cold. I guess it may have helped if the staff would explain what should have been done with the plate of ingredients and pork that accompanied the undecorated bowl of noodles, rather than just leaving us to our guessing game.Overall, a jolly good meal, and I would so definitely come back again and again, but whether I would wait it out for an hour next time round remains to be seen.",

It was almost 1pm and I was lucky to get a table. There was no patron sitting outside. I ordered from the set menu, the set I chose came with a small bowl of Shio Ramen, edamame and \u00a0a plate of gyozas (5 pieces). I added a Tamago egg.FOOD (4/5)Shio Ramen 5/5The bowl of ramen reminded why I was back to this ramen shop. It was delicious, broth flavorful and noodles cooked right. The Tamago egg was a delightful addition to the ramen. They went so well together. Gyozas 3/5Last year the gyozas were very good, this year they were just alright. The gyozas were not hot, just warm. The side of the Gyoza which supposed to be crispy was not crispy enough. AMBIENCE 4/5I like it. The ramen store does not have too many seatings, I wish it would be bigger. I did not see a restroom inside the ramen shop? SERVICE 5/5The staffs were polite and nice. I am happy with the service here :)",

    "text": "Who remembers, what Japanese food dining was like, before Hokkaido Ramen Santouka came to Singapore? 11 years ago, I remember my friends discussing about a ramen gathering at The Central, Clarke Quay. I wasn't too familiar with ramen back then. I decided to join them, and I've never looked back. Ramen food options are available in almost every major shopping mall these days. But when it comes to tender pork cheek, there's only 1 major ramen joint majority of my friends and I swear by, and it's Hokkaido Ramen Santouka!Kaisen Hiyashi Maze-Soba $16++ *Highly Recommended*Served with a choice of 2 vegetables and 1 meat. This is my favourite dish from their new menu! Served with salmon sashimi, prawns, ikura, scallops. Any seafood lover would go crazy over this dish. I'm not a huge fan of broccoli, but the sauce made the broccoli tender and sweet, so I ended up devouring all of them!\u00a0Check out the colours, fresh in terms of taste and texture. The noodles had a nice bite and was able to retain the moisture and flavours from the sauce. Remember to mix the noodles nicely with the sauce, to obtain a balanced taste. The aji-tsuke menma (flavoured bamboo shoot) and cheese toppings are also my recommended toppings. The\u00a0aji-tsuke menma provide a crunchy feel in every mouthful of noodles.This sauce was a tad sweet, with a slight nutty aftertaste. The noodles though, looked clumpy, are not!Spicy Shio Ramen $16++All the broths at Hokkaido Santouka Ramen are hand made, served together with al-dente ramen noodles. It warms my heart every time!\u00a0 One of the reason why I love Santouka so much is that\u00a0they are able to bring out the delicious flavour of the ingredients to the maximum extent possible, yet retaining the same mild, gentle flavour.My ramen meals here never feel too \"ger-lat\" or MSG-ladden.\u00a0What makes it more alluring, is the tinge of spiciness that gives the ramen broth a nice refreshing taste!The broth maketh ramen, and at Santouka there's 4 options, Shio (salt), Shoyu (Soy Sauce, Miso, and Kara Miso (Spicy Miso).\u00a0The char siew has a perfect balance of lean meat and fat.Strawberry Parfait $13.50++The parfait was topped with fresh, sweet strawberries, followed by smooth, milky vanilla ice cream that didn't taste too sweet, beneath the large serving of ice cream was crunchy corn flakes, followed by drips of strawberry sauce. I liked this parfait in the sense that it wasn't drowned in strawberry sauce or sweet syrup. I enjoyed the light milky vanilla ice cream with the fresh and crunchy corn flakes altogether. A perfect way to end your ramen meal!\u00a0Overall : I liked the two new menu additions to Santouka and I'll definitely be back for more Kaisen Hiyashi Maze-Soba goodness! With 2 central locations, Santouka Ramen remains as one of my top options for ramen in Singapore. The salmon sashimi, ikura goodness cannot be replicated elsewhere, not to mention with their additional menu offerings like strawberry parfait, Santouka is keeping up with the Singaporean tastebuds that are ever changing.",

    "text": "I was surprised to received an email from Ramen Santouka. It seem that being a follower of Ramen Santouka, I will receive a free bowl of ramen on the week after my birthday, which was quite a great deal considering that a bowl of ramen costs about $13.50++ at the ramen outlet.There was 2 ramen outlets in Singapore, Clark Quay and Orchard. I decide to visit the Orchard outlet as I had not eaten there before. The outlet was lcoated next to Harry's in a row of shophouse, behind Centrepoint Shopping Centre. There was both indoor and outdoor dine in area, but most prefer indoor as it was air-con. I was showed to a table indoor. While it was cooling, I could not feel the air-con. Could be due to the place was packed.There was 4 choices for the free ramen : shio, shoyu, miso, and kara miso (spicy). I decided on the miso version.Food was served swiftly together. Water was served free of charge.Miso Ramen ($13.50++)The ramen was served topped with fish cake, sesame seeds, shredded black fungus, bamboo shoots, and shredded spring onions. The soup base smelt quite porky. It tasted quite rich and flavoured, but porky too. Although the serving looked small, I was quite full after having it.Sake Ikura Gohan ($5++)Grilled Salmon & Salmon Roe Rice BowlThe salmon flakes was just a thin spread of layer on top of the rice. Felt disappointed in the serving. The salmon flakes was a bit too salty.Overall the food was not bad. The place was a bit too warm with barely any air-con. I was seated by the wall, which seat was rather worn out and sunk in. Think its time for the place to get a makeover.",

    "text": "This Japanese ramen chain has a few outlets in Singapore. I tried this one on Cuppage Road due to being in the area. It is not that big, seats around 25-30 people inside and maybe a bit less outside. We were there at around 7pm on Wednesday and managed to get some of the last seats and we then saw a queue building outside. They had a lot of staff for such a small place (I saw 6 people serving) but they for some reason seemed very stressed, running around like headless chickens. They were friendly but due to being so stressed they first got every persons order wrong so we corrected them twice and then when food was delivered there was something missing from each persons set meal. They apologized and fixed things fast but this still gives a doubt as to how the place functions.Now on to the good part, the set meals are good value for money and the ramen is very tasty. The pork cheeks can be highly recommended as well as the Gyoza and the char sui bowls. They also have a pretty nice craft beer selection. The ramen bowls are good and I think the Shio ramen base was the by far best but of course that also says something about my preferences. Still this is a very good place to satisfy your Ramen needs.",

    "text": "The \"king\" suggested the roasted pork cheeks and when the \"king\" recommended something, you better listen. I'm glad I did. I did not fancy Santouka after trying one of its ramen dishes at the first outlet in The Central. I found the broth too porky and salty and oily. At that time good ramen eateries had just entered Singapore market and the other popular ramen joint was Marutama with its lighter chicken broth and runny yolk egg (which I preferred). So I never stepped foot into a Santouka again until now. The roasted pork cheeks (Tokusen Toroniku) ramen with your choice of broth (Shio, Shoyu, Miso or Kara-Miso) is a clear winner. It's Iberico pork and apparently available in limited quantity daily. I guess we were lucky since all 5 of us managed to get that at about 8pm.There are 3 sizes starting from $21++, it just means more noodles, not meat, for the bigger portions. I find small is just nice. They do give a generous serving of the pork cheeks (6 regular slices I think, not those sliced till razor thin type) plus the bamboo shoots et al. The egg is extra cost, good but not that great. I can skip that next time. The noodle was al dente and the shio broth was not as salty or porky as I feared. In fact the meat was also not that porky with the dreaded pork smell/taste which can turn the stomach. The pork cheeks were rich and smooth, similar to the taste and texture of a braised pork belly without the gelatinous fatty bits. I could die happy just having the iberico pork cheeks as part of my last meal, not the noodles. I could detect a faint alkali taste in the noodles. Not a fan of that. This will really be the only dish for me to order if I dine here again. Don't forget - Roasted pork cheeks.",

However, I was a bit deceived by the noodles, which were a bit \"hard\".My friend ordered pork cheeks which were amazing. They literally melt in your mouth.The atmosphere is okay, very noisy but expected in Singapore. There are some seats outside but it's very hot.",

Thank god I tried santouka again. I ordered the shio classic ramen and everything is perfect: al-dente noodle, fresh tasty soup, melt-in-your-mouth chasiu, perfectly soft-boiled tamago, Reminiscence of that first time I had santouka in San Diego, California. Will be back again when I have a craving for Hokkaido ramen.",

    "text": "With so many ramen places popping up in singapore i am honestly quite sick of it. I tend to find the soup a little too salty, and it os just a bit over priced for soup noodles when we have a lot of nice soup noodles to choose from. However this is one of the best ramen i had. Went with in laws and we ordered the iberico pork cheek ramen and 3 sets. 3 of us had shio soup base and my mil had the spicy miso (kara miso) The broth was rich without being overpowering and too salty. The noodles firm and especially the iberico pork was super tender. My regular cha shu was pretty good too though nothing special. My set came with salmon and salmon roe rice. That could do with a little sauce or flavour but it is otherwise quite a good balance to the rich soup.",

A first taste of the ramen without mixing the ingredients felt great. Definitely, mixing the ingredients made the ramen much nicer. The Spain Iberico pork cheeks were full on flavour and smooth. The ramen tasted smooth and springy. A definite must try if you are here, and the servings are generous too!A recommended place for ramen and one of the best ramen restaurants in Singapore as voted by numerous websites and blogs, I personally feel the same that this place truly deserves to be one of the tops. Must come!",

When I had it though, it wasn't spectacular, and certainly the soup was warm instead of hot. My friend had the pork with a spicy mince meat added, it was okay as well. I liked the spice but the soup was too gelatinous. With the increasing amen joints invading this small nation, i'm not sure santouka would be my pick if not for sheer convenience of proximity.",

    "text": "Met a motley bunch for lunch last week, and we found ourselves in Somerset, looking for Japanese food. A hot tip told us to head to Cuppage Terrace, and Ramen Santouka was the first to greet us (well not physically, because it's a shop, not human, and... oh nevermind). Now I'd heard of the place before, so in view of the other options (Indian, Greek, Indian, zi char, closed izakaya, closed ramen by Nantsuttei in OG!!!) I suppose Santouka was an easy pick.Hungry people order fast, and thank goodness for that, because they were 30 minutes from the end of lunch hours - closed kitchens and I don't do well together.Highlights? Pork cheek is STELLAR. Get it. I didn't order it, but I should have. I pinched a good couple of slices of a buddy anyway (see what I did there? I pinched the cheek? hahah... oh nevermind). I was a-hankering for tsukemen for some reason, and it was pretty good, except the soup wasn't very hot. And when you're dipping cold noodles in semi-warm soup... it gets cold quick. To qualify the temperature though, there s a page in the menu about why the soup temperature has to be just so.Other than that, the lack of functioning air-conditioning needs to be addressed. I promise you, I can sweat it out with the next glutton at a hawker centre of your choosing, but I don't know if I was meant to do the same in this restaurant. The presence of the box-fan provided some relief, but was it meant to be there in the first place?Parting words? Pork cheek. Get it.",
