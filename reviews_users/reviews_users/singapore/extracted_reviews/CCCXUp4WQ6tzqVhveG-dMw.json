    "text": "I am certain that there is not a single Indian food restaurant I have given or even have considered giving a 5 star Yelp review to before. \u00a0But with that, I am happy to say good things about Punjab Grill. \u00a0Other reviews are correct, this is an expensive restaurant. \u00a0It is located in Marina Bay Sands, it is nestled amongst the stores of the swanky shopping mall, it is in the tourist area of the bay. \u00a0It almost goes without saying, the prices are obviously going to be higher. I am not going to lie...this place will set you back a few bucks. \u00a0But I still would not take back my 5 star Yelp review, because we felt the customer service and the quality was absolutely there. \u00a0But what do I know really. \u00a0I am a white girl, from the Midwest of America (Indiana to be exact) and really only gage my Indian food by the quality of the take out from the corner food stahl down the street of wherever I am living. \u00a0I say this only partially joking. \u00a0I do like Indian food and I will eat it from the street stahl and the fine dining experience and know enough to know the difference. \u00a0Even with that, I still give the Punjab Grill a 5 star on Yelp. My husband and I were there on a Monday night, so maybe the quiet Monday night setting set it up for better quality customer service. \u00a0Regardless, we felt welcomed and waiting on hand and foot for the entire time we were there. \u00a0The dining room space is unexpected, being appointed with a contemporary feel, out of the blue being more intimate than we anticipated, with lots of glass and mirrors and more tastefully done than we had foreseen. \u00a0The setting almost does not feel like an Indian spot, but it was a nice touch to the ambiance of our experience. \u00a0You could be dressed up or more business casual, the attire could run the gamut a bit. \u00a0The ambiance is not stuffy and over the top in any way. \u00a0There is a little chef hat next to each food item that is recommended by the chef, so we went with six items that all had the little chef hat (if you don't know what to order, order what the chef is guiding you towards - always a good rule of thumb!). \u00a0For our first time here, it was a great way to taste what they considered their best items. \u00a0We were not disappointed. \u00a0From salmon tkka to Paneer Lababdar, we were savoring every bite. \u00a0If I knew this was my last day on earth, I might request the Bharwaan Khumb Peshawari. \u00a0No joke! \u00a0It is that tasty....like mushroom/cheese/melty ecstasy really! \u00a0Really really delicious and worth every penny! \u00a0Temperatures, preparation and presentation was all spot on. \u00a0I think this is not only my first 5 star Yelp review for an Indian restaurant, I know this is my first 5 star Yelp review in Singapore. \u00a0And although I know there will be more in time (I don't hand them out readily), I am thrilled to have experienced Punjab Grill and it was my first. \u00a0We will happily be back.",

You can tell by how quickly they change color on the top layer after 10 minutes. Sauces tried to. E different but unimaginative and bland.

    "text": "We reserved this place for 9pm and were there at 8:58pm sharp. After being ignored for 15 minutes at the entrance, we tried to walk in and see if they notice us which is when we got our table.We ordered a 5 course veg and a 5 course non veg degustation menu. We were very excited to visit this place but the ambience appeared bit disappointing. It seems they haven't cleaned the glasses for ages.Our disappointment reached another level when food started coming in. I think we made a big mistake coming here given that there are other good indian restaurants around here in Singapore. The only thing we liked was the sorbet after starters which was supposed to clear your throat. Not to mention their service is way too slow to be acceptable. If you have made this far reading this review, I really hope that if you go there you really know what you are wasting your money, time and calories on.",

    "text": "This is restaurant week and Punjab Grill was the first place I wanted to eat. \u00a0I don't remember how this restaurant got on to my to-do list but it did and under further scrutiny it stayed there because it seemed to be a well regarded celebrity chef establishment. \u00a0Guess what, it was downright mouthwateringly good. \u00a0The following meal is just the set menu for RW but I think its a good indicator of how delicious everything is.Even though this restaurant is in the basement of the Marina Bay Sands the ambiance is very clean, calm, and modern. \u00a0I especially liked the spice decorations. \u00a0Our meal started with an amuse-bouche fritter and some poppadum. \u00a0Their yogurt and mint sauces were unique.The meal progressed onto soup: basil and tomato shorba with truffle pygmy naan. \u00a0It was fine, I don't really enjoy tomato soup, but there was a hint of some spice that made it fun and bearable. \u00a0Our appetizers were very nice chicken and salmon tikka and then a lamb kebab. WOW. I haven't had fish that good in a while.For the main we had rice with grilled trava fish in a mustard sauce, lamb in \u00a0nice gravy, rice, and dal. \u00a0We got extra of the dal. \u00a0They offered extra of everything for the main course but we were so full we couldn't even think about eating more meat. \u00a0So just enough dal was put on our plates to clean up with the garlic naan. \u00a0We love naan.We thought the meal ended with the desserts: Indian ice cream pistachio, rice pudding, and carrot halwa. \u00a0They all tasted very traditional but were good.My one and only criticism is that the music is a bad piano laden karaoke soundtrack. It should be immediately replaced by a man in the corner playing a sitar. \u00a0I'm not kidding. \u00a0It might break with the modern esthetic of the place but it will be SO MUCH BETTER.Luckily for the meal and the end of this review the meal actually ended with a shot of Betel leave and ice cream. \u00a0It was a super cool finish and very tasty. \u00a0Much better than trying betel nut on its own.",

We had the fixed four course lunch menu. One vegetarian one non-vegetarian. Both were outstanding. Each of the dishes had some heat but each had its own distinctive flavor. The little appetizer and palate cleansers were a surprise and no, they did not count as any of the courses. Service was superb. Attentive without the feeling of hovering at your shoulder. The restaurant was also full at 1pm on a Saturday which says a lot for lunch in that part of the city at the weekend.",

    "text": "The Punjabi grill is an amazing restaurant. We ended up going to this place by chance but were so glad we did. Let's start with the ambience. the lighting was perfect and our host greeted us enthusiastically and happily. We especially loved the decorations on the walls and the amazing chandeliers. Now to the food, we ordered the power lunch which we thought was expensive at 40 bucks a plate but it turned out to be one of the best meals we've had in quite some time. They give you three starters to start with. One paneer that melts in your mouth, one sabudana vada, and one kathi roll. All were good. They also give you an aloo bonda on a curved fork. All of this was topped off with a pineapple sorbet to Cleanse the palette. The main course was three vegetable dishes rice and naan. One of these dishes was a paneer dish. It was simply out of this world. There was also a dum aloo dish, it was tasty and spicy. The final dish was a five daal dish. Good but unremarkable. the rice was hot and fluffy. \u00a0The naan was well made and soft. The dessert was again three separate dishes - gulab jamun, kheer, and raspberry chocolate cheesecake. Amazing, amazing, amazing! My husband still cant shut up about the amazing compressed napkin. They put a mint in front of you, pour some water on it and turn it into a marshmallow. \u00a0Before you know it its rolling out into a scented wet towel to wipe your hands with. The entire show is pretty epic. All in all a five star experience, no doubt about it.",

Given that Singapore has so many really good Indian restaurants, I'm surprised this earned its spot in MBS. There was no particular dish that stood out or worth mentioning. :( And I was appalled when during dinner, someone that looked like a dishwasher or delivery service walked right in the middle of the restaurant! Don't they have back service doors???",
