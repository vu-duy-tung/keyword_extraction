We were a little disappointed by the selection of wine listed under premium wine. \u00a0We also ordered a bottle of sparking water to help ease spicy food later.Cucumber salad with garlic was crunchy yet tender. \u00a0Fresh cumber mixed with red chili and garlic sauce was very good, after we finished eating cucumbers, we kept the sauce to use it later for other dishes.Asparagus appetizer was cooked well and it also went good with the chili garlic sauce we kept from the cucumber salad earlier.Steamed Sea bass was so moist and tender, sauce used to flavor the fish went really well with sea bass. \u00a0In fact, we ate every edible parts of the fish. \u00a0The fish was that good.We also had their famous chili crabs. They were good but it seems like all chili crabs taste the same. We'd had chili crabs from other restaurants in Singapore, and I thought all I had so far tasted the same. \u00a0Since the chili crabs were a little spicy for me, we ordered several buns to ease my spiciness in my mouth. \u00a0We were trying to stay away from carbohydrates but this bun was so yummy, I ended up eating 3 of them. \u00a0Eating chili crabs brought back so many good memories I spent in Singapore in the past. I think I had chili or black pepper crabs at almost every visit to this country. \u00a0Must have in Singapore, right?Service was excellent. \u00a0The server exchanged serving plates for each dish. \u00a0When we started eating chili crabs, she kept coming back with more wet towels and more plates to keep our table and hands as clean as possible.When we finished eating, we were very pleased with the quality of food served here.Free WiFi here - ask the server for password",

I've been here on National Day and also on NYE and the view watching the fireworks over the river is to die for! The food here is good quality, nice service and great location. Who doesn't love Asian 5 - 12 course meals!? I LIVE FOR THEM. I'm so grateful everyday to be half Chinese.From what I remember from the times I've eaten here nothing on the menu stood out as being bad - everything was delicious and the staff were very accommodating in changing around a few dishes when we called about menus etc. For views of the fireworks (or in general as well, a nice place to bring tourists!) this place is a winner!On regular nights there is a little light show that happens as well - nothing big but just telling you .. it's there. I think its coming down from MBS? I'm not too sure but .. just to let you know!",

Half a roast chicken, some stir fried mixed vegetables and a small steamed fish with 3 bowls of rice came to Singapore $205/-. See my pictures. Is it any wonder the restaurant was empty! It will not do well if it persist in charging such exorbitant prices for really very ordinary food. It was Saturday night and the restaurant was empty! You wonder why.",

The scallops along with the giant prawns melted in my mouth and the sauce had the perfect amount of spice to it. The fried buns that accompanied the dish were not too much and perfect for dipping in the sauce.I also had the durian crispy ice cream for dessert, it was so creamy and delicious and not overly sweet.I would definitely recommend and return here!",

    "text": "If you're a fan of Chef Yong at Majestic, you'll like his second restaurant at One Fullerton called Jing. I had a few lunch meetings here last year and the food was memorable. So much so that I can wax lyrical despite having eaten tons of over the top Cantonese meals as a Cantonese daughter. My love for Cantonese food only extends to good soups, zi char and modern Cantonese fine dining. I loathe eating the traditional 8 course parade of abalone, braised vegetables yaaawn. Hence Jing by reputation was already on my good books.Jing has a modern feel to it, with a gold and moss green scheme offsetting the brown flooring. The private room I've dined in is spacious and has good acoustics so you're not craning your neck to hear the presenter at the opposite end of the table. The contemporary aesthetic pervades the menu, which Chef Yang (formerly from Pine \u00a0Court) sending out some familiar Cantonese dishes with a modern twist. The perennial Peking duck ( I still haven't figured out why Cantonese restaurants serve Peking duck) skin is served with pan seared foie gras and caviar, which tastes incredibly rich compared to the watermelon and foie gras at Majestic. As I am against killing sharks for their fins, I thought the use of sharks bones for soup both maximized the lost of life and produced a wonderful deep, milky broth. The crispy fried fish with soy sauce was very fresh and had great texture, while the crystal prawns were equally fresh, crunchy and evenly coated with wasabi mayo. To end the meals, lobster noodles was in order and trust me, you will not regret ordering these noodles done to perfection, despite what I imagine to be a pretty hefty price tag. The cream of avocado dessert with coconut or vanilla ice cream is also unusual yet refreshing. In all, you won't go very wrong bringing family or work meetings to this restaurant.",
