    "text": "Pork stew ($16.80 for an individual portion++) - 2 starsSpiciness Level 1Glass noodlesToo little meat and too much fat and bone. There weren't many pieces to begin with. Worse still was the broth. Yes, we got it not very spicy but that shouldn't be an excuse for it tasting like flavorless pork fat. The one good thing was the purple rice that came with it since I'm used to Korean places here only serving white rice.Spicy beef ($15.80++) - 2.5 starsBetter but again very little meat.$38.40 after the service charge and GST. Not worth it. They charge for water and we didn't get any. Two miserable \"banchan.\" Portions were small and we weren't full. The menu was also very limited - you won't see things like japchae or more homestyle dishes here. They pretty much just have some stews, hotplates, fried rice and egg. Very disappointed. -1 star for these!",

    "text": "Recently another new Korean restaurant has opened in the shopping mall. It was known for its stew which is available in pork, beef and chicken. Remember to press the button on the table when one is ready to order.Water was served in a bottle.Banchan (appetizers)The Banchan available were lettuce with salad cream, pickled radish, and kimchi.Pork Rib Stew ($16 individual/$29 double)The stew was available in soy flavour and 4 different levels of spicy flavour. One can choose udon or glass noodle for the stew.I had selected level 1 of spicy flavour with glass noodle. The glass noodle was transparent flat noodle which was similar to kueh teow but with a chewy texture. The stew was served on a stove to keep warm. Quite rich and thick which one felt will nice to have plain rice to go with. The pork rib was fork tender but a bit too boney.Rice ball - Tuna ($8)Rice balls with tuna, Korean white rice, seaweeds crumbs, and crushed chilli padi.I topup $6 to upgrade the plain rice in the pork rib stew to rice ball.Step 1 : Put on gloves.Step 2 : Mix well.Step 3 : Mould into riceballs and enjoy.Quite an interesting and enjoyable experience. It tasted not bad too.Overall the food was not bad and served quite fast. Maybe it was because the place was not crowded and almost closing time.",

    "text": "Was craving for Korean and always appreciate a good stew place. Had the pork ribs and got kimchi fried rice. Liked the kimchi fried rice however thought the pot on the stove made it unstable - not the most convenient way to eat. I would put it in a hot stone pot instead - Korean style The stew was okay, a tad bit too sweet for me but it was still good. The pork was done nicely too Their spicy level is on point, got it at level three ( out of 4) Saw a rice cake delivery come in and they are using the \u00a0which is one of the bigger brands in korea. Only had one rice cake but it was done nicely too. If they had radish in the stew it would have been cherry on top Portions for one are just right though too huge for my small stomach. Great casual Korean restaurant",

    "text": "This korean restaurant exceeded my expectation. Though they do not have a very elaborated menu but it's substantial.Firstly, you MUST order their signature stew. We went for the pork stew with Level 1 spiciness. It's a good introduction. You may opt for other meat of your choice (i.e beef, chicken) and of course higher level of spiciness if you can take it and and and... you can top up extra noodle, rice cake etc... \u00a0sounds fun? Me on the other hand opted to take the rice ball instead of the normal rice with a surcharge of SGD6. The anchovy, seaweed and rice mixture were given to you to mass yourself ! It was fascinating to use the glove and shape those warm rice and fragrant anchovy into cute balls for serving =)Next, we also ordered a squid and leek pancake. It was crispy on the inside and soft in the inside. Super yummy.Will definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu",

The rice ball is tasty although if you are a dog owner you will recognize that familiar feeling of a plastic bag picking up something warm and soft lol Service. They forgot our kimchi. Actually that's my biggest bone to pick. I'm a big fan of Korean side dishes but there is none. That's disappointing. Price is fair. Expect to wait on line since it's popular at the moment. I'll try it again. This experience is sort of 2 star.",
