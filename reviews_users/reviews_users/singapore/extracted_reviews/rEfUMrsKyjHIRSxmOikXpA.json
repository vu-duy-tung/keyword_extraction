We had tempura, shrimp, soup, sushi, sashimi and nigiri. I can't forget sake! We had 3 bottles! What a great experience! We sat at the sushi bar and ate like glutenous kings. Located near the famous Dempsey rd. This place has extremely fresh options and was beautifully prepared.Not so humbly submitted,Michael C.",

    "text": "Had dinner here with a couple of friends on a Friday night, and the bill came up to about $45 per person, after taxes. For a Japanese buffet in Singapore, this is quite cheap!I found the food here surprisingly good, and sashimi here is fresh and thickly sliced. They are not stingy, but you will have to be very specific with your orders. Everything else like tempura and grilled items are the same standard as what you will find at Sushi Tei. For what you pay, really, this place is a bargain. Service is very iffy here, and they are quite under-staffed, but you can't ask for too much when you're not paying top dollar for reasonably acceptable food. Do book in advance because this place gets PACKED! Dinner starts at 8pm, no earlier, no later, and there will be a crowd waiting outside.Would return.",

My best experience thus far has been in Japan at the tsukiji fish market. I would rank this in terms of quality and taste as the worst sushi I have had in Asia thus far. I would also rank many places in America above this restaurant. Their service and staffing is fantastic though.Specifics:Temperature of the sushi: warm.Cut of the sushi: excellent thickness.Quality of the sushi: poor quality, very muscular, stringy, viscous and low fat content. Flavor of sushi: potent fishy taste, the salmon, yellowtail, and tuna all taste the same. Temperature of rice: rice was cooler than the sushi! Big \u00a0no no.Quality: grainy and lacks the traditional \"sticky rice\" feel.Flavor of rice: average. Sushi to rice ratio: 1:1 ratio, which is fantastic.Conclusion: This is a no go.",

The food here was as good as any other Jap food I've ever eaten (note though that I'm not a connoisseur and I don't go around eating at Tokyo Michelin restaurants). You go NTUC buy sashimi oso $95 per kg aredi. So if you got big belly, confirm can eat enough to cover the price. Remark: Much less crowded than when I last came in 2013 - possibly because of the recent sashimi scare. Which is good if you are not a typical Hamji-porean, because less crowded means prompter and better service.",

Ikoi has a good spread of yummies as always. You know this because on a Tues night, the restaurant is PACKED!Ate too much food and loved these very much: 1) Chawanmushi - for a buffet item, it really good. It's got a good size piece of chicken and half a crabstick. The egg is soft and tasty too. As good as the ones I make at home. 2) Fried Fishcake with Cheese - its really the normal Fishcake with a hole in the middle and the melted cheese together with the fried-ness. Nice! 3) Salmon Sashimi - generous, fresh thick slices of salmon yummies. You order by the slices so that awesome! 4) Teriyaki Salmon - they grill the salmon pieces till nicely charred on the edges and the thick teriyaki sauce is a great accompaniment for the taste. There were many dishes I enjoyed but I couldn't remembered exactly how much I have eaten. It worked out to be about $40 per pax and it's $40 well spent!",

    "text": "The number one gripe I have about Ikoi is that it appears too run down! And it's always packed! But if that doesn't bother you, then you're in for a good time, especially if you're a sashimi lover! Think free flow of swordfish, salmon, yellowtail, tuna, snapper and octopus. That's the reason why this place is always packed. You definitely get your money's worth from this buffet. There's a wide range and Japanese dishes with the glaring omission of unagi which is surprising. You can skip the rest of the filler dishes like fried chicken wings and focus on the important stuff - sashimi. And for the prices they charge, its really a steal!",

You order your food with the wait staff - and you tend to get carried away ordering for a buffet - sharing the load of stuff you ordered with your friends is one of the best things ever. For less than $40, you can get free flow of your favourite sashimis (mine is swordfish and salmon), tempura, tofu dishes, fried rice, soba noodles, and best of all Shishamo (or some would call 'pregnant fish'). You can't get shishamo at your regular sakae sushi outlets so when you find it at a buffet, it's hard to restrain yourself from ordering a dozen of it to share with the table!Like others say, this is a very busy place, always packed so make sure to book way in advance, you won't regret it!",

With tax and service charges all in, you usually pay under $50 and for that amount, I think Ikoi is pretty stellar.This place is always packed so don't stroll in and expect a seat - give them a ring a week earlier to arrange a booking. This buffet is a-la-carte style and the variety is decent enough for you to be a little bewildered about what to order. A must-try (over and again) is the sashimi. Salmon, yellow-tail, tuna, octopus, hamachi - eat your fill. The tempura is also well-done with a light batter coating fresh vegetables and crunchy prawns.What I like about the vibe of this restaurant is how it isn't too posh looking - the interior is modest but exudes a nice sense of familiarity. Space is a little tight but the hustle and bustle about is actually what adds to the experience.",

    "text": "Had their Japanese buffet lunch for $35 a pax. Given the huge number of Mediacorp celebrities that have apparently endorsed this restaurant, I was expecting something extraordinary. The restuarant itself had a humble feel to it - nothing too formal. It does a good job of recreating the traditional Japanese restaraunt atmosphere - for the seats on the side, you can even take off your shoes to sit cross-legged, Japanese style. Even the Wordart emblazoned on the menus can be nicely disarming - a nice, if unintentional touch. Sashimi was great and came in many varieties. I enjoyed the salmon, although the tuna itself was not that fresh (neither does it give the choice of parts). Compared to other Japanese buffets I've had, however, I found the variety lacking. They did not have the assorted vegetable tempura, not the baked scallops or bacon rolls I've been spoilt by. Nonetheless, the dishes they did have - chawanmushi, karage chicken, shishamo and tempura - did not dissappoint. Come here for a good meal, but leave your expectations at the door.",

It is highly popular, with reservations having to be made 2 weeks in advance in order to dine in Ikoi. Walk-ins are difficult to fulfill as they are usually full house. Even if walk-ins are accepted, one might be allocated counter seats which are not very conducive for over the dinner chatter.At $33++, Ikoi is one of the better Japanese buffets for it's excellent quality. Sashimi is fresh and the tempura are fried well. One of my favorites that is quite well done is the grilled shishamo and tebasaki (chicken midwing joint). In large groups of more than 8 people, customers will be able to dine in a private room with waitresses waiting to take your orders. The menu also comes in at an astounding 80+ items.Overall, I would describe it as a pleasant setting with good food. While not all the items on the menu are of the best standards (I don't expect them to specialize in every dish), all dishes are of good standards. Protip: Call and make a reservation at least 2 weeks before the lunch/dinner appointment. It is that popular!P.S. Parking will be in the underground carpark in Hotel Miramar.",
