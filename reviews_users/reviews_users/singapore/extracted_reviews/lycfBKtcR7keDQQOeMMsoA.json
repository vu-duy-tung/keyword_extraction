It had a relaxing, cosy ambience that can be romantic depending on who you're with. The service staff were attentive and showed outstanding knowledge of the items on their menu. The food was excellent. My partner naturally had the steak and declared that it was the best one he'd had in Singapore. It's of course a pricey place, but definitely one I'd go back to on special occasions.",

    "text": "Given that I've had one of the best bistecca fiorentina's of my life at La Giostra in Florence, my expectations for this one were pretty high... Walking into the converted shophouse, everyone in my party was impressed with the restaurant's modern wooded interior and warm welcome which included complimentary toasted focaccia bread served with an unctuous olive oil. \u00a0To start our meal, the four of us ordered the chicken liver pat\u00e9 crostini & the burrata cheese with a tower of grilled eggplant & tomatoes. \u00a0The former was regrettably forgettable, and while the burrata was really creamy and a big hit with my mother, I actually prefer the burrata flown in from Italy 3 times a week at Valentino at Turf Club Road. \u00a0That one has a soft \"cheese shell\" which adds texture and resistance as you bite into it.Moving onto the mains, we took their recommendations and ordered: 1) the Wagyu beef parpardelle with mushrooms and saffron cheese(left) and 2) their signature steak(below). Sadly, I found that neither of them lived up to the real thing in Italy. \u00a0I was disappointed with the parpardelle whose saffron cheese seemed an unnecessary addition on the plate and just made it really salty.As for the steak, I preferred the medium rare, beautifully thick juicy pieces I devoured in Florence. \u00a0They was tastier, and the meat just looked more appetizing! \u00a0The one at Bistecca Tuscan were sinewy and a little too chewy from the tendons. Perhaps I am being picky, and biased towards the more 'filet mignon' texture of the meat served in Florence.... Nevertheless, no one will deny Bistecca Tuscan needs to work on their presentation!! Why drape a random spring onion over a messy pile of beef?That being said, the HUGE saving grace (and surprise!) of this lunch for me was their DELICIOUS homemade bombolini (or italian doughnuts and semolina fritters) served with a cup of cold cappuccino for dipping. \u00a0I don't usually touch the dark stuff, but even so, I couldn't stop slurping down the cool cappuccino liquid. \u00a0The doughnuts were soft and fluffy on the inside, with a crispy, sugary exterior that made ME want to melt into the dish. \u00a0I would go back again and again, JUST to have this dessert!Overall, I would say the pros: good ambiance, warm service, GREAT doughnuts... the cons: average steak, non-spectacular mains, expensive! \u00a0See my pictures at: thefearlessdiner.wordpre\u2026",

Went with a big work group and so we had a number of starters to share. A few of them were hit and miss, however, I would recommend the pan roasted octopus, pan fried scallops and creamy burrata. Very tasty. For the mains, we shared the Fiorentina Wagyu T-Bone and the Costata Bone-In Rib Eye (along with salads and veggies). Am glad I was seated in front of the rib-eye as it was a lot tastier than the T-bone (I would even go so far as saying the T-bone was just standard). The rib-eye on the other hand, was cooked to medium rare perfection. Very succulent, juicy and fatty. Yum. Definitely recommend this place, especially for large groups where you can get a little bit of everything.",

    "text": "Bistecca - Tuscan Steakhouse in Mohamed Sultan DistrictIt has become a tradition for Little Devil ('LD') and I to celebrate our special days in a Steakhouse. I celebrated mine in Wooloomooloo November last year. So this time around, after scouring the net, we decided to on Bistecca - Tuscan Steakhouse.As it was a weekday, reservation was a breeze. I actually gave them a called to inform them in advance of this special is my LD's birthday. Nestled in Mohamed Sultan buzzing row of houses, finding parking can be quite troublesome. The best part, I did not notice that Bistecca provided a Valet service on Wednesday to Saturday from 6 pm onwards. So silly me, we ended up parking in UE Square, walking quite a distance from the car park to the restaurant.We were seated on the indoor front section of the restaurant, where we can see the bar and chefs at work. The restaurant has a nice classy dark oak wooden setting, with dim lighting and leather chairs. A painting of a lady with two buffalo feature prominently in the centre of the restaurant. We were quite lucky that the manager actually look after our table, so service was great throughout the evening. To kick start this special occasion, we started with our favourite drinks, Lemon Lime and Bitters. \u00a0A drink that we fell in love with when we are in Melbourne, it is difficult to find this drink in Singapore but recently it is getting more popular and we are so glad. Following the drinks, we have our starters; \u00a0Insalata di pomodori, burrata, prosciutto e rucola (Creamy burrata cheese, sweet parma ham, Momotoro tomatoes and rocket with italian dressing -$18) & Crostini fritti di fegatini alla toscana (Lightly pan-fried Tuscan country bread topped with house made chicken liver 'pate' and fresh majoram - $15).Burrata with parma ham has become our favourite entree. As long as the burrata is fresh, nothing can go wrong with this entree. All the ingredients here are fresh combined, mixed in fresh tomatoes and balsamic vinegar it is just refreshing and appetizing. The crispy crostini create a nice complement to the smooth and creamy chicken pate.For the mains, we ordered medium rare Costata (1-1.2kg bone in rib eye of Bistecca's exclusive organic grain fed Wagyu - Holstein. Marble score 6+, aged - $178). The sides accompanying the steak are Gratin di patate ai funghi porcini (Potato gratin with porcini mushrooms - $14) & Crema di spinaci (Creamed baby spinach - $15). The sauces selection are salsa verde, garlic mayonnaise, Porchini mushroom, and red pepper / tomato compote (our ketchup) + mustards. The steak has a nice balance of meat and fats are cooked to perfection. It has a nice charred on the outside that seal the juice inside the meat, and perfect medium rare on the inside. On a first bite, it is beautifully tender and slowly melts in your mouth. Any sauce you choose will go nicely with the steak, I preferred the garlic mayonnaise and salsa verde. My secret weapon to tackle this huge steak is lemon. A little bit of lemon juice will help to cut through the fats of the meat and avoid you being overwhelmed by the fattiness. The creamy spinach is not to my liking, as it is creamy, mushy and a bit bland. However my LD enjoy it, so it is fine by me. The potato gratin has a nice texture of crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, with a nice potato and porcini flavour. After all the food, we only left a little space for dessert. So we decided on Zuppa di rabarbaro e fragole con gelato allo yougurt (Rhubarb and strawberry \"soup\" with natural yogurt ice-cream - $12). The staff manage to put a candle on the ice cream and it become my wife official birthday \"cake\". Although the rhubarb and strawberry \"soup\" looks like a baby food, it tasted refreshing and wonderful. It has rhubarb sweetness, strawberry sourness and the creamy yogurt ice cream just blend in nicely together. The dessert is on the house and what a way to end a nice evening. Yummyy!!Overall, dining in Bistecca was a wonderful experience. Service was great and we won't hesitate to recommend this place for steak to our friends. Price is on the upside, however you are paying for quality. We'll be back for more in the future. Saluti e arrivederci !! (Cheers & See you again!!)Food & Drink: 8.5/10Value: 8/10Service: 8.5/10Ambiance: 8.5/10*** If you want to check out the complete review with pictures, please click on my food blog.

    "text": "By far the best steak restaurant in Singapore. Forget Morton's and the rest. The ambience, food quality, and service were outstanding. Ambience is a casual yet trendy modern European feel - anyone would be comfortable here in a suit or khakis. Definitely a great alternative to other stuffy steakhouses. Sorry Morton's, I grew up eating your steak in Chicago but it's time to say goodbye. Now for the main event: we ordered the 1.1kg bone-in ribeye and it was heavenly. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the meat was the definition of what a fine steak should be. They offer a selection of steak sauces on the side but please skip them and enjoy the beef directly (btw, ever wonder why every filet mignon comes with bearnaise sauce? \u00a0Because filet has NO flavor!). Side dishes were equally brilliant - mushroom risotto, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach paired nicely with the steak. Had a blended super Tuscan which brought the whole meal up a notch. The hostess, waitstaff, and bartenders are fantastic and are clearly a cut above typical Singapore restaurant staff. \u00a0My first time dining here and it certainly will not be my last - bravo!",

Anyways this one here at Bistecca was spot on in terms of rareness and along with its assortment of sauces salt etc ensured that every tastebud was catered for. For me I think it was just too much. Yes you can have too much of a good thing. When it's of that price and quality you really want to enjoy it. Not force to eat it cuz u spent so much on it.. lol anyhooo Bitesticca serves a pretty mean steak I would definitely return for more",

    "text": "I had looked forward to going here for quite some time, so was disappointed, unfortunately. This is based on *one visit*, so hopefully won't discourage others from trying it (as most others have positive reviews). Also, this may just be how it is in Singapore at this kind of restaurant!Food: The quality was top notch and prepared perfectly.Drinks: I only drink wine but found the selection to be good =)Service: They texted me to remind me of my upcoming reservation. I like this, except... The text also said the table would be turned over 2 hours after. I found this rude and made me rethink going. I am not a slow diner, but it is typically just me as I travel by myself a lot. I don't want to pay a lot to feel rushed.Service (continued): They sure didn't seem to be in ANY rush when I got there. Not only was the place not fully booked, I wound up waiting. A lot. On everything. I got my wine and then about 15min later, my first course (delicious). I was done with the first and waited for ~22min more before I finally waved someone down. They cleared my plate. I didn't keep track at this point, but my steak (main) finally showed up as I finished my glass of wine. I asked this person (because who knows where my wait staff went) for another. I don't like a steak without wine. Unfortunately, this took a very long time. Steak was cold by the time I got the second glass. Overall I was stuck there for over 2 hours when I didn't WANT to be.Ambience: It has a lot of promise, and this may be regional, but I found it filled with families with kids (a Sunday night) that were terribly behaved (a lot of shouting). There is not much the restaurant can do about this, however, so I try not to ding them for it but will warn others (or let parents know, hey, this is a good place for kids).So I wound up spending over 2 hours, over US$100, for a rather stressful, loud, drawn out meal in which I had to flag waitstaff down constantly. Thankfully the food was good! When I'm back in Singapore next, I will walk by and see how full it is. If they can happen to fit me in and its quiet, great.",

    "text": "There's actually very few places to have a decent steak in Singapore. There's a lot of places that offer some kind of slab of fairly young beef, not or little dry aged, and fried using methods that do not give the high heat required to get a good char on the meat whilst keeping the insides red or pink (like the Josper grill that has conquered all the London steakhouses). For example, the steak served at a famous 313 Somerset steakhouse is a travesty for the price, it's just flashed on a warmish pan, I can do that at home (and better; I'd actually leave the pan on the fire for several minutes before putting on the steak, so it's hot enough to char the meat, not end up with a greyish slab of depression).This you should bear in mind, because it explains the pricing. Yes, $188 for a 1.1kg steak is not cheap. Yes, the main pieces - Costata, Bistecca - are not dry aged, not significantly that I could taste anyway, but you do get the option of a 45-day aged Angus for $60. As for the cut it's pretty simple: \"bistecca\" is a T-bone, which is slightly less tasty and has more bone, and \"costata\" is a ribeye, which should be your default order at any steakhouse as it has the most flavour, although it is quite fatty (doubly so since this is a wagyu breed with plenty of marbling). The fat in the ribeye is where the flavour concentrates when you dry age the cut. T-bones are fillet and strip steak attached to a bone; both cuts are very soft and tender but lacking in flavour compared to the ribeye; considering the ribeye is cooked properly and therefore will also be tender, the tenderness of fillet However, the flame grilling method is sufficient to get the right char on the thick cut steak which qualifies Bistecca as a \"decent steakhouse\" in my view. It's literally a wood fire built in their kitchen, with a grill on top, and the steaks on the grill in the middle of the flame. It's a shame you have to choose between dry aged and charred crust (the Angus is 300g, too thin for a proper crust to develop) but at least both are an option. The sides are what you expect when you pay $15-25 for high end Italian in Singapore. Honestly they could serve mac and cheese from a tin and I wouldn't care, since I come here for the steak and barely touch the sides. But they are very good (I miss the lentils and sausage, if you're reading this, Bistecca chef), and could be a meal by themselves if necessary. The interior is original, thoughtful, interesting, it goes beyond the \"Nordic minimalist\" look that you get everywhere and where it's hard to draw a line between fast food joint and cool modernism. Cow hide on the floor, hilarious paintings on the walls. Service is prompt and knowledgeable, including knowing about how a thick cut steak will be rawer close to the bone and thus might need a bump up in doneness versus your usual. This gives the place a much friendlier and more fun feel than the \"big name\" steakhouses like Morton's or Cut. If you prefer the 5* hotel feel, you might not enjoy Bistecca, it's more of a quirky boutique hotel. I personally love it.What could be improved? Simple: dry-age the costata for 45 days as well (or go wild: 60 days!), and charge me extra for it (because I know how expensive storing something for months is in Singapore, especially with the humidity). I'll still buy it, because there's no alternatives except maybe a couple of items on Cut's menu. Bistecca would not, or barely, be competitive against the institutions of London or New York (like Goodman's), but it's offering enough to be THE steakhouse of reference in Singapore as far as I'm concerned. I just think it's a shame that you can source dry aged meat and you don't bother on your flagship cut. I also miss the cypresses or whatever trees were shading the front porch...",

I don't enjoy drinking reds, so my friend bought a bottle of Chardonnay which the waiter recommended, and he brought his own bottle of red, which they decanted for him. We started the meal with a large salami platter, and pan fried scallops, which came on a bed of root salad, and crispy pancetta (just fancy bacon). The salami was better than I thought it would be, because my scallops were a disappointment! The scallops were a lot less brown than what I am used to. The salad they came with was pretty meh.... For $35 bucks, I expect a little more.I ordered a Shiga Ohmigyu Wagyu A5 steak rare, which is a Japanese full-blood Wagyu Rump (200g) at $90. My steak was perfect. If they can't cook scallops properly, rest assured they can do beef here, perfectly. My steak was juicy and full red in the middle - yum! The steak came with a plethora of sauces, but good wagyu don't need no dressing 'cept salt! Our sides for the steaks - asparagus, kipfler potatoes, french beans, were as good as sides could be. I do wish they did mashed potatoes. I do love mashed potatoes. **sad face**We ended the meal with a cheese platter and a glass of limoncello each. The cheese platter was nice, with a nice mixture of hard and soft cheeses, with sweet apple bits and preserved figs. Yum!Would I come back? Yes - if I wasn't paying, of course. This place is quite the rip-off.P.S. I like the women's' washrooms here. They have some feminine products in case you have an \"emergency\"!",

Disappointingly, the waiter was unable to properly explain the differences between the Fiorentina (t-bone) and the Costata (ribeye).The meat is cooked correctly to your specifications (medium-rare), and is a decently good steak. Disclaimer, I have not had a true European Costata or Fiorentina so I had no proper comparison. However, taste and texture-wise, the meat just didn't seem to justify the outrageous cost. To note, the meat is not dry-aged, which affects the flavor. A similar quality steak could be had for much less in the US.They provided quite a selection of sauces to go along with your steak, salsa verde, porcini mushroom, mayo... but given the high quality of steak do you have to slather it with sauce? (I wouldn't)To put things in perspective, you can consider it one of the top places for steak in Singapore, but it cannot compare with steak at good places in North and South America.All in all, the final cost ended up in the 3-digit range for two people for the steak, a couple of sides and appetizers, without alcohol. It's good, but not *that* good. What's that I smell? It's not the grilled steak, it's the smoke wafting from the hole in my pocket...",

    "text": "Inside an unassuming storefront,Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse is a slick room that goes back farther than you think. \u00a0While the specialty here is steak and in particular a tomahawk with a choice between a Japanese Wagyu ribeye and an Australian Porterhouse. \u00a0We chose the Porterhouse, as it is closer to the cut I would expect in Italy. \u00a0We started with a couple of apps - \u00a0 Grilled prawns wrapped with lonza with fennel and an arugula salad with prosciutto and straciatella cheese. \u00a0Both were excellent. \u00a0In addition to the steak, we also tried a couple of pasta dishes, which were actually very good - the pumpkin ravioli tasted very fresh and light. \u00a0The tagliatalle with oxtail was hearty and also excellent. \u00a0The wine list here is basically all Italian and there is a good range of choices, and the Nebbiolo wine (same grape used in Barolo) drank beautifully for under $200. \u00a0As for the steak, well, it was good, but I wasn't blown away! \u00a0It was decent but I just wasn't impressed, especially for $188. The cut had too much fat and not as flavorful as I expected. \u00a0Desserts here are solid, and we were not disappointed by the 2 classics - tiramisu and panna cotta. \u00a0So far, I am been to Bedrock and Bistecca and while both have been good, they haven't been great. \u00a0And service at both places could be improved. So while the steak was a little disappointing (and expectations were very high), the apps, pasta and dessert were all solid.",

    "text": "I recently went to Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse with a couple of friends for dinner and it was a great experience, to say the least.The first thing that struck me was the beautiful design and ambience of the place. We had to walk through their little gate and up the terrace, which accommodated al fresco dining, before getting into the restaurant. It was a very nice setting for an evening night out to relax, and I'd say it's a good place to bring your date or celebrate special occasions too. We were pretty hungry when we arrived, but I can safely say that the 3 of us left feeling extremely satisfied. We first had the Polipo (pan roasted octopus with preserved lemon, olives, Pachino Sicilian tomatoes and rocket salad) and Rucola (rocket salad with tomato, prosciutto and stracciatella cheese). The octopus was plump and nicely cooked, and had great texture that was not overly chewy. As a meat lover, I was surprised that my favourite appetiser was actually the Rucola. The cheese complemented the dish perfectly and made everything work, it was a very nice balance of flavour in a salad, and the prosciutto was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.Next, the Tortellini di Angello (lamb and mint tortellini with parmesan and pecorino cheese). I am not a fan of mint, but I really enjoyed this dish too. The mint was not overbearing and made the dish lighter on the palette, while the pasta and lamb were cooked perfectly.Now comes the star we'd been eagerly anticipating - the Fiorentina traditional Tuscan sharing steak. A generous 1.1kg cut of beef that serves 2-3 people, perfectly medium rare. Steak perfection indeed. This is simply the best steak I've ever had. Absolutely delicious and definitely worth it. We had the sides of Asparagi (charcoal grilled asparagus) and Patate (Tuscan fries, rosemary, crushed garlic), which were alright but nothing could take our attention away from the beautiful steak anyway. Last but not least, dessert. We had the Panna Cotta (vanilla panna cotta served with fresh berries and a pistachio crumb topping), Tiramisu (served with coffee custard), and Torta al Cioccolato (valhrona dark chocolate tart with coffee crumble and a scoop of passion fruit gelato). The panna cotta is stunning, with a perfect creamy texture and a real delight. It is the dessert that made room for itself in my stomach. The tiramisu was delicious as well, but I would prefer it to have more of an alcoholic kick. The chocolate tart was rich and the gelato immediately melts in your mouth with a refreshing taste. I love dark chocolate and passion fruit, but I don't quite get the combination of both flavours. I found myself going back for more tiramisu and panna cotta to end the dinner.Overall, it was a fantastic dinner with a lovely ambience and welcoming staff who made it a comfortable experience throughout. We were definitely well taken care of that evening. If you enjoy a good steak, need a nice venue for a date, or are looking for a pleasant evening out with friends/family, I recommend Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse!",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner with a friend at Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse.tinyurl.com/c5tnwbtThe ambiance is warm and inviting. \u00a0There is quite a bit of unique artwork on the walls. \u00a0We sat in the downstairs area.tinyurl.com/c4ql4rfThere is also at least one other seating area upstairs.tinyurl.com/cmwzhnhThe service was inconsistent. \u00a0It started off very attentive. \u00a0However, as the meal progressed, it became a food drop-off service and then waned to the point that we were left waving our hands to gain the attention of a server to order dessert and to garner the bill.The food ranged from sub-par to very good.Complimentary Bread-sticksWe quite enjoyed these simply bread-sticks and olive oil dip. tinyurl.com/d4rxus7Bruschetta al pomodoro con burrata e olio al basilico (Toasted homemade Tuscan country bread brushed with garlic, topped with crushed tomato and creamy burrata, finished with basil oil and a pinch of sea salt)I really liked this dish. \u00a0The burrata was so creamy. \u00a0The tomatoes were not overly acidic. \u00a0I did think the bread could have used a touch more crisp to fight off the moisture from the tomatoes. This is a minor complaint. \u00a0My friend \u00a0does not eat cheese. \u00a0So, I had the added bonus of getting to eat her portion of the burrata.tinyurl.com/d7ep4b3Panzanella estiva con cappesante (Roasted scallops on top of a classic Tuscan bread salad with onion, tomato and olives)First, this simply is not panzanella. \u00a0By any name though, this was an average dish. \u00a0The scallop was slightly overcooked. \u00a0The flavour of the scallop was also stronger than the delicate sweetness I prefer.tinyurl.com/cbww6qmCostata (1-1.2kg bone-in rib eye - for 2)This is what we came here for. \u00a0Actually, I came for Bistecca Fiorentina. \u00a0However, after a less than useful conversation with the server, we decided on the Costata. \u00a0I tried to discern from the server the key difference between their specific cuts (fat content, grain, flavour profile, etc...). \u00a0However, the server said they were the same for each. Next up, since we were sharing the steak, we needed it to be cooked in a manner that each of us can enjoy \u00a0I prefer medium rare on the rare side. \u00a0 She prefers a more true medium rare. \u00a0I am quite ok with this. \u00a0I tried explaining to the server that we would like the steak cooked to a true medium rare. \u00a0He stated they prepare them more on the rare side of medium rare. \u00a0I explained once again. \u00a0He suggested they prepare the steak, bring it out and, if needed, they would cook some of it some more for her. \u00a0I attempted to explain that this would ruin her portion of the meat. \u00a0If returned to the fire after slicing, meat will almost instantly seize up and become tough. \u00a0After making no headway, I gave up.In the end, he brought a steak that, while not blue, was certainly more rare than medium rare. \u00a0Even with me focusing on the rarer portions, we had to assemble some slices for her \u00a0and return them for additional cooking. Yes, this meant her portions were significantly less tender than mine.All that being said, this was not the most significant issue with the steak. \u00a0There was an extreme oiliness to the steak. \u00a0This was true in texture and flavor. \u00a0It was very disappointing.tinyurl.com/c64228bSauces: salsa verde, garlic mayonnaise, Porchini mushroom, and red pepper / tomato compote There are four sauces served with the steak. \u00a0I am not sure why in serving a $180 steak they feel sauces will be required but they do provide them. \u00a0For the most part, we only took a mild interest in them. \u00a0After trying each, none really stood out as something either of us would like to add to a steak.tinyurl.com/c4qr2dpPur\u00e9 di patate As whipped potatoes go, these were very good. \u00a0They were light and buttery. \u00a0For an \u00e0 la carte \u00a0side, the portion was a little small. \u00a0Luckily, for me, my friend was more focused on the asparagus.tinyurl.com/cpc3cgtAsparagi grigliati con olio al limonThis asparagus was quite good. \u00a0The grill had imparted a nice flavor and brought out some of the natural sweetness of the asparagus. \u00a0It was also still very crisp. Through an unspoken agreement though, she ate most of the asparagus and I ate most of the potato puree. \u00a0tinyurl.com/bws9us3Homemade hazelnut gelato To end our meal, hhile she enjoyed a limoncello, I had a delicious scoop of hazlenut gelato.tinyurl.com/boyo8gpReceipt ($514.35)tinyurl.com/cmr5vmmOverall, there were just too many inconsistencies for me to recommend Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse. \u00a0 If they were able to deliver on the true experience of a Tuscan steakhouse, this would be a restaurant that I would visit frequently. \u00a0They did not. \u00a0If they could have delivered on a true Tuscan steak, I would probably look beyond the service, they did not. \u00a0This was simply not an experience that lived up to its lofty price-tag.",

    "text": "What I absolutely love about Bistecca is the signature Bistecca Fiorentina, a mammoth-sized t-bone steak that weighs in at 1-1.2kg. While they recommend it to be shared between 2 or 3 people, I find myself perfectly happy gorging on this beauty alone. Not that I don't like to share, but if I'm going to be paying $178 for it, I want to enjoy it the best I can. Its simply seasoned with salt and pepper (like how all good steaks should) and grilled over a charcoal fire that results with plenty of charring. It's served pink and juicy and in deliciously thick cuts which I find makes for fantastic chewing. If you're the type that prefers your steak well-done, I'd say give this place a miss because you'll be wasting your money. There are other sides, but since I had no room, I have to go with my dinner buddy and say that everything is pretty decent (he only got to try a tiny slice of meat).",

    "text": "Bistecca is an easy steakhouse to love and they deliver on points that count. various parts of my family have dined there and love the consistency of the food and service. I went there for dinner with my family this past Sunday to celebrate my Dad's birthday. Dad loves steak and Cantonese food and since we children had the choice for once, we picked steak. The restaurant has some outdoor seating, tables at the front and back of the ground floor and probably some upstairs. We were seated at the back section on the first floor, surrounded by very loud diners at both tables around us. I asked that we be moved to a quieter section and the waitstaff obliged quickly and painlessly. We had a couple of steaks (filetto, Fiorentina single cut and a Shiga Wagyu), pasta, 4 sides and two starters to share among 3 men and 2 ladies. It was just the right amount of food and some of the highlights for me were the starters - a perfectly grilled polipo and giant lump of burrata with Tuscan tomatoes. The portions were as you would expect with the relatively higher rent in Singapore compared to Tuscany, but the seafood was fresh and the tomatoes as sweet as it was off the vine. I also loved the ribeye cap and meat off the rib bone, charred crisp on the outside but left medium rare on the inside. Perfecto! The roasted Kipfler potatoes were also excellent (its like a slightly bigger version of the baby potato and a nice taught skin when cooked). Finally, our waiter was kind and discreet enough in helping us serve the birthday cake and took some pictures too. Just the kind of fuss-free evening we were looking for and I happily paid for it. Will be back again when the tummy or occasion calls!",

That said, the steaks were a must-try, get the bone-in steaks to share if you've got at least 4 persons in your group.Service was upbeat, attentive and warm. Our water glasses were never left parched, and the wait staff sported wide grins with a twinkle in their eyes.We had:1) Coniglio ($25) - tagliatelle tossed in a full-bodied rabbit ragout, mixed mushrooms and pancetta: exquisite. I love bunnies (as you can well tell from my moniker), but wowoweewa, this was truly glorious. It's a little difficult to feel guilty when this was so awesomely good.2) Risotto al Tartufo ($35) with porcini, parmesan and generously littered with black truffle shavings: intoxicatingly delicious, creamy, and wonderfully comforting.3) Fiorentina Manzo ($188): a massive 1.1 kg wagyu-holstein T-bone, and incredibly tender and juicy. I loved its full-bodied decadence, and beautiful charring4) Asparagi ($15): perfectly grilled asparagus sticks imbued with a heady smoky aroma5) Gnocchi e Funghi ($13): a mushroom medley with chewy potato gnocchi, and tossed with butter and thyme, was unfortunately laced with parsley despite instructions to hold all said herb off. Good thing we had a parsley lover in our midst or we'd have sent it back",
