The food are fresh but why I given only a 3 starts I think the service are not on point. \u00a0But again if you just there for the food I will suggest you give if a try. You can book ur table via chope app.",

    "text": "The buffet menu is long, and encompasses all styles of Japanese cuisine (except shabu shabu). The quality is pretty awful, worse than Sakae Sushi. We tried this out with the Entertainer 1-for-1 offer; otherwise, at $41.90++ per pax it's not worth it, with such poor quality. Contrary to other reviews, we found the wait time quite good. Service is pro-active. Maybe an acceptable choice for some, but sorry it ain't us.",

    "text": "For S$34.80 (exclusive of GST & service charge), you really cannot beat the price for quality Japanese buffet restaurant in town. Everything I ordered was a top notch quality. The sashimi was really fresh, so were the other things I ordered. Tempura was also very good. Idk what flour they used but even after my tempura had been sitting for quite some time, it was still very crunchy. Everything I ordered came out very fast. The waiter was also very responsive when it came to refilling my tea.I really like the fact that it's a la carte buffet. I do not need to worry to be the first in line so that I'd get the nicest cut of sashimi or smth like that. What I need to do is just sit nicely on my table, order whatever I want, and eat the food that I order. Ambiance was also great. Though it was a full house but the noise level was very minimum. Not to mention that they also serve beer. I can def see myself coming back to this place often. Just a side note, S$34.80 is the buffet for main menu only. So if you want to get dessert or drinks, there would be an extra price you'd have to pay.Came here on a Saturday for their buffet lunch around 12.30 pm. I suggest you make a RSVP by calling them in advance if you can as I can really see this place could easily get crowded on weekend especially. Their last order for buffet on a Saturday is at 2 pm.",

    "text": "Understandably popular because of its location and reasonable price point, this a la carte Japanese buffet restaurant has nevertheless deteriorated drastically in terms of service standards and food quality. I used to dine here once in a while, but now make a conscious effort to go elsewhere when I'm craving Japanese buffet. The last couple of times I visited, I was sorely disappointed with the appalling service. They make you note your orders on coloured sheets, and it is natural for them to miss out on a couple of your scrawls. However, a substantial number of dishes never made it to our table, making it seem like there was a concerted effort to ensure that patrons don't get everything they ask for.The food is mediocre, and the sashimi is of poor quality. It used to be notably better, hence I'm certain that I will not be returning anytime soon as there are far better quality options out there.",

The sushi was not the freshest I have tasted, although the katsu dishes were pretty well done. The chicken and pork cutlets were crispy and moist, and a hot favourite with the party I was dining with. What I didn't like about the place was that it was too cramped and that service tended to be a little slow - perhaps understandable for a busy weekend evening, but not something I would prefer. Given that the location was not extremely accessible, I wonder if you could find something comparable in town or in the city.",

    "text": "How far the mighty have fallen. That's what I would use to describe this place. It used to be one of the best Japanese buffet restaurants in Singapore, but after my last experience with them I would not go anywhere near Minori anymore.I started visiting this place way back in 2008 and at the time service was good. As an a-la carte buffet, service is probably one of the most important components of your offering (aside from the food) and the service level has dropped so much since then. They used to take around 5 to 10 mins before delivering your order, the last time I went I had to wait 45 mins due to confusion. The fact that their prices are really cheap (note: I don't say value-for-money) attract a lot of patrons, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, and I believe that as a result of that the staff are unable to cope with the volume of orders and drop the ball one too many times on orders.",
