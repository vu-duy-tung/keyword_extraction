    "text": "Overloaded and Overflowing with GoodnessPhotos of Izy's Signature Nokke Roll have been appearing on my facebook and Instagram feed for a while now and we just couldn't resist the opportunity to give it a try. Sushi at 10 pm? Why not! Izy is a very modern yet cozy dining bar with counters for seats. No fancy table cloth or setting, just a bar, a napkin and the most powerful tool you'll need in a Japanese restaurant, chopsticks. The senior staff members were very friendly, thanking us for coming down, explaining and proudly showcasing his in house made bottled cocktails to us but the younger guy.... looked tired and a little stoned but not unfriendly just.... monotonous. Japanese Nokke Roll ($45)Yes... at a glance, $45 is A LOT for sushi but once it hits your table, you'll understand why it's worth every cent. 6 rice rolls were overloaded with a heavenly mixture of crab, ikura (salmon roe), negitoro (fatty tuna) and my favourite, Uni (Sea urchin) The rice here is very lightly vinegar-ed, allowing you to taste the full flavour and sweetness of each protein. The seafood was very fresh and didn't have any hint of fishiness. Ikura's were bursting with a rich, almost creamy saltiness, while the negitoro melts in your mouth, leaving behind a pleasant hint of tuna. The uni was to die for. Rich, creamy, melt in your mouth goodness that brings together that indescribable sweet, umami, fresh from the sea sweetness. Rainbow Roll ($20)While this may seem like the more \"common\" modern sushi, the rainbow roll here is amazingly well executed. The salmon was wonderfully fatty, the tuna, fresh and delightful, the snapper, amazing, I've never had snapper that tasted that clean, sweet and fresh before. With a mixture of fish as a topping, each bite brought a different experience yet, the flavours and textures of the different fishes brought out \u00a0different complexities in the dish while the cucumber added that fresh crunchy bite and the avocados, which were so creamy, tied the flavours together harmoniously. All I can say is, having a sushi roll at Izy's isn't just a dining experience but an adventure you hope would never end.",

    "text": "This place is worth a visit, I've been here now for both lunch and dinner and found it to be highly enjoyable on both occasions. This is an awesome place with some of the coolest \"classy graffiti\" I've seen in Singapore. Upscale yet modern and hip feel. Ideally, you should opt for the counter seating so you can see the magic with your food being prepared by the chefs.For lunch, I ordered the Truffle Waygu Don. Seemed like a no brainer to visit a place for the first time and get that one and I have no regrets for doing so. Sliced truffle and perfectly cut waygu that melted in my mouth made this an incredibly worthy choice for lunch or even for dinner. The rice was excellent as well. I also ordered their fried chicken which was also very good. Ice cream was included which was a choice between blue cheese with shiso or pineapple. We got one of each and surprisingly the blue cheese didn't taste like the blue cheese that I dislike so much. Very much enjoyed it.For dinner, I brought out a group with 5 others and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Sitting at the table outside, we did the pork skewers, the sea urchin linguine, the fried chicken and also one of the fish dishes. Everything was perfect, we ended up ordering multiple orders of each. We topped it off by ordering a few bottles of sake and felt pretty amazing afterwards.I love it here. The service is great, location is right at the start of Club Street which makes it easy to get in and out (or hop to another bar after dinner), and something to take note of is that there is a cool speakeasy in the back with some awesome creative drinks. One of my favorites in Singapore and I know I'll be back.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place, I really do. But the dishes definitely has a \"trying too hard\" issue. The chef tried to ensure that there is a burst of flavors in almost every dish - sweet, spicy, sour and salty.....and not in a good way.With good ingredients, sometimes all you need is to let the ingredients shine through and there is no need to over-season. We tried practically almost all the recommended items, and some were just bad (karage chicken), some were interesting (like hmmm, interesting, but we don't have to eat it again).Another disappointing tapas bar. I am almost giving up on tapas in Singapore.",
