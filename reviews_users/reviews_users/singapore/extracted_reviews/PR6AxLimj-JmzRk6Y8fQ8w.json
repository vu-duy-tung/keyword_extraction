I had the chai latte and my mum had her latte. Both were equally fabulous. My chai had some really nice foam on the top which I seriously loved. Sadly, we didn't order any food but their breakfast menu looked and sounded delicious. (I uploaded a picture of their brekky menu)Definitely recommend this place.",

One morning I began in Chinatown and led myself here.I ended up staying for quite a bit; I think maybe 2-2.5 hours while going through a breakfast burrito (ok) and 3 smooth chai lattes (some maybe with shots (\"dirty\"), don't recall).After my 1st chai, it dawned on me that the Seahawks might be on one of the international sports networks. I asked the waiter about seeing what they can do to find out if I can watch the football game later. After awhile, we got ASN on the flatscreen! Woot! I was pretty happy being able to watch almost to half-time. I appreciated them doing that.Service from a waiter and a waitress was very pleasant and kind.Cool beans.",

This was my 9th day there and I thought it might be time to put some good old fashioned Burger in me. So with the good reviews, I was off on a taxi here.Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed from several angles. First off, in looking at the menu, I didn't realize how expensive this place was. I got the Premium Slider, the Steak Aussie slider. My friend got the Wagyu Beef burger. My sliders came with three and it was $25. It didn't even come with fries. It definitely was not filling enough, so you needed fries. Maybe somewhere in Los Angeles, sliders could be worth $25. Then if you thought $25 wasn't so bad because you don't really have to pay tax or tip in Singapore. You're wrong. They charged a 10% fee plus another 7% fee. I ended up paying $44 for 3 small sliders and a $12 beer. It was definitely not worth it. The 4.5 stars this place has is definitely not worth it.",

They always also have a rugby game going. \u00a0All of the usual suspects are offered for breakfast, mostly served with grilled tomato or baked beans, a very English/Australian breakfast. \u00a0They do serve a Texas size toast for those that like alot of bread in the AM. Be careful of ordering a alcoholic beverage for breakfast as its pricey. Stick with a coffee or orange juice without the kick.This is the only place in Boat Quay that is open for breakfast, not as glamerous as brunch at The Fullerton, but still a sold choice if you are looking to eat breakfast in the area.",

    "text": "Though smaller than it's Roberston Quay location, Boomarang Boat Quay is still a pretty cool place to hang after work or for watching sporting events. Both levels have big, flat screen TV's that are placed strategically so no matter where you are, you can get good views of whatever's going on.Admittedly, I've really only come here for sports, not for food. Earlier this year, I was here for the Super Bowl, and most recently I came with the intention of watching the practice rounds for Formula 1, only to discover that none of the channels were providing live coverage. (D'oh!) Downstairs, there's lots of seating and outside they have small tables where you can congregate with your drinks for happy hour. It can get really hot, though, so definitely ask for a table upstairs if you want air conditioning and less noise.This is an all day dining concept, so I've tried their breakfast and some snacks. I found their French toast a bit too sweet, but well portioned. Coffees were okay, nothing to Yelp about. For happy hour, their wine is affordably priced per glass, and my hummus plate was decent at $10.Though I can't speak for their main courses, I've been pretty happy with their space and location. Definitely a great gathering for groups to watch popular sporting events and get bar bites.",

Well, I guess that is what people happen to do, and for Australians this is one of those places in Singapore. Not only do you get a raft of Australian beers (no craft beers unfortunately, and the only ones on tap are VB and Pure Blonde, but at least you can get a Coopers Pale Ale with a stubby holder) but they also have both the AFL and the NRL playing on the big screens. Okay, despite the fact that I am a bit of an explorer, I simply cannot turn down an experience of home in a foreign city, especially if I get to drink a Coopers Pale while watching the footy. Sure, I can do that whenever I want back in Melbourne, but there is something cool about doing it while in Singapore. Okay, I probably wouldn't recommend spending all your time here (why bother coming over here if you were going to do that) but it was still a pretty cool place. Oh, before I forget, the Coopers Pale tasted a little different, not like what I am used to back home, but still, it was cool.",

The burger was the worst I have had in Singapore - bland meat, stale bread, and a huge wedge of turnip stuck in between.
