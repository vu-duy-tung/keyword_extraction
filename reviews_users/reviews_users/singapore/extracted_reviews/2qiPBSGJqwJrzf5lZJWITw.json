    "text": "The baristas' skill at creating elaborate designs out of milk foam is testament to how seriously the owner of Patisserie G takes her craft. Ms Gwen Lim identifies her target consumers as \"a niche group of people who understand French pastry and are discerning about good-quality French products\", namely the \"well-travelled\" Singaporean. Mm not the humblest way to plug her p\u00e2tisserie, but must say she really knows how to appeal to the yuppie psyche.Lemon Cheesecake, $9.00 - One forkful of the cheesecake should be enough to convince you that these cakes are worth good money. The filling is zesty and creamy without being too heavy on the palate, and flecked with crushed vanilla beans. The biscuit crust is actually crispy (!!) and tastes slightly singed, but went pretty well with the citrus filling and the strip of candied lemon peel. There's this thin gelatinous cover on the cake which I find odd, but its mostly tasteless and adds glossiness to the cake so meh, I'll live with it.Triomphe, $8.50 - Named after a historical monument, the Triomphe sported a lustrous toffee-brown coat that made it resemble a giant piece of Werther's candy. This baby was calling out my name so I decided I had to eat him. The caramel mousse was malty, ever-so-slightly burnt and, to sum it up: just divine. Within the cake there are a couple layers of soft hazelnut sponge, but the mousse was the friggin' star of the show. If it were up to me, I'd add a praline base or something crunchy at the bottom to provide some contrast in texture, but I'm sure the chef is better than I am at knowing which ingredients go together. In any case, the magical mousse is reason enough to justify repeated visits to Patisserie G.Flat White, $5.50 - The coffee selection here is proof that Patisserie G isn't going to bend over backwards for pedestrian crowds. Our respective requests for a mocha and a skinny latte were met with an apologetic \"We don't do those here.\" from the waitress taking our orders at the counter. Embarrassed by my wimpyness, I manned up and got a flat white. Patisserie G gets its blends from artisan roasters Liberty Coffee (specifically the Speakeasy brew), which should please coffee aficionados. My flat white was nutty and robust.I watched in slack-jawed wonder as one of the baristas artfully crafted the smiling face of a bear on another customer's latte, then scowled in displeasure at the very unelaborate heart on the surface of my flat white. I'll be back, and I'll be sure to request for a bear on my coffee.",

The Lychee Rose is probably the better macaron I have ever eaten. It is sweet with very noticeable taste of lychee and rose. For someone who likes sweet stuffs, this fits perfectly into the picture. The Salted Hazelnut macaron is also very nice. The hazelnut taste was very distinct and was less salty.",

    "text": "Almost a year after my first visit to Patisserie G, I found myself here again, twice in fact since I arrived in Singapore 6 days ago. So what holds the attraction to this place for me? Clearly, my darling girlfriend working at Millenia Tower is one big factor. Then it comes to: FOOD 5/5I love their cakes! Not only they looked esthetically pleasing, they tasted good too. I just had a cake named \"Poison Apple\". It looked like an apple. It was so pretty. I told my friend I would either be Snow White or the evil Queen. But she agreed since I had to eat the \"Poison Apple\" then I would be Snow White then. I hope the seven dwarves would appear if I fell on the floor, and my prince would eventually show up. Right!! ;P Anyhoo, this \"Poison Apple\" tasted good, inside was a mix of cake and the center reminded me of apple pie. The other cake I had tried recently was the Lychee Rose Cheesecake. I recommended that cake too. Even though it was a cheesecake, it was not too heavy. The Mango & Pear iced tea was refreshing. I had the same during my last two visits. AMBIENCE 5/5I love the openness of Patisserie G. I particularly like the outside seatings.SERVICE 5/5The staffs were as always friendly and helpful. Now I am already thinking what cake should I try next? :D",

By the vibes alone, I would consider this place a gem I'd want to keep to myself for the alone times c:Had their Tropical cake ($8.50) and a flat white ($5.50). Not usually a fan of these type of cakes (see the photo) but this is hands down the best I've ever had. Mango passion mousse, banana marmalade, chocolate sponge, coconut chantilly and a butter crumble base. \u00a0The flavours came together in a harmonious fashion-simple texture, yet layered and intriguing. The flat white is not bad too-above average, considering how it focuses on it's bakes. Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Love the pastries here. The chocolate sea salt cookies are an exact match to the Pierre Herme chocolate sea salt cookies - decadently chocolatey with the zing of salt to keep things happening. They also do a lovely crumbly buttery salted egg yolk cookie for Chinese New Year. The chocolate eclair is also very decent - some places have their eclairs sitting in the display cases slowly drying into cardboard crumbliness. But Patisserie G's eclair is fresh enough that the choux has a crisp shell and light interior. Helps too that the cream filling is usually richly flavoured. They've done well enough over the years to expand to additional seating outside the shop. I love their morning breakfast offerings - croque monsieur, buttery croissants and lightly brewed coffee. \u00a0Good place to hang out, chill over a cuppa and a nicely made sweet.",

Decor is in light, natural wood colors. Relaxed music in the background. Polite service. Water and newspaper for your free taking and reading. Perfect setup to chill, relax, grab a bite with a friend or colleague.\u00a0They manage to keep it simple when it comes to the menu. For savory, eggs cocotte/scrambled and gourmet sandwiches. All of 7 sandwiches to choose from. Not a problem as they make them very well. My fav is the Parma ham, mushroom relish, arugula and Gruyere. Accompanied with crisps. Yummy to the last bite.\u00a0Not a big connoisseur of coffee. I only know when it tastes good. And to me this is good, especially with the desserts they have. Again, not a mind boggling vast selection but what they make, they make well.\u00a0My only sticking point these days is that it gets pricey to have these types of lovely dining experiences. Fine if you make oodles of dough but for many it's out of reach. =(Very much recommended!",

Their coffee selections are extensive ranging from: double expresso, to double macchiato to Cappuccino and Flat white. I understand they source all their coffee beans from local artisan roasters, liberty coffee. I would say Patisserie G's coffee edges out it's neighbor Commune upstairs. I find the cappuccino here tastier, the latte art more detailed, and the coffee having more of a subtle finish (which I prefer).The pastries, albeit on the expensive side, are Classic French favorites: macaroons, cheese cakes, chocolate mousse, lemon cakes, strawberry cakes, etc. I'm not a Pastry expert so I won't elaborate more than I have to, but they are of very high quality, among the highest on the red dot, especially among those offered to the regular consumer outside of high prices restaurant establishments.Overall, I'm a big fan of Patisserie G. However, I will ding this pastry shop one-star for removing \"Everyone Loves Us Yelp\" sticker. This is a very special accolade that few local establishments get globally. Yes, some yelpers may give tough reviews, but overall the Yelp Community in SG are huge fans of Patisserie G, especially me.",

Their cakes are delish and also pretty to look at.

    "text": "Revisited the possibly most French local patisserie shop in Singapore to try its not-so-new cakes that were launched during my absence in SG. Gone was my favourite Douceur. Along the way, we had the Eggs En Cocotte with Bacon ($16), a French dish that hasn't seem to rise to much popularity for brunch in Singapore yet. The savoury custard was well-seasoned and wiggly, speedily demolished with the soldiers of fragrant toasted brioche. Meantime, the Creamy Scramble Eggs ($15/add on with smoked salmon $3) might not be as grandiose as the soft luscious yellow clouds served at Bills, but was a heart-warming delight to go with its reputable croissant. Yes, I've had it previously with my dark chocolate drink and it still stays VERY delicious. The Lemon Cheesecake ($9) exhibits great character, distinguishing itself from the usual baked cheesecake with a livid lemon curd in the centre and a reliable chocolate biscuit base instead of the occasionally cranky graham crust. The Hazelnut Opera ($8.50) was particularly iffy; unquestionably tri-textures of the hazelnut ganache, coffee sponge and chocolate ganache, but the hazelnut tones weren't pronounced. The Nouvelle G ($9), a 73%-63% dark chocolate spaceship lookalike that had a delicate sandy yet crispy chocolate feuilletine which was finer than any of the feuilletine here. But the star was the Coconut Choux Tart ($9), a pretty revolutionary piece that focused on the coconut-flavoured Carribean rum. Nothing much to speak in terms of coconut accents, but the beloved textures of all the components; chantily cream, (empty) choux puff, salted caramel sauce and Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e custard tart is enough to make this gateaux a highly saleable one.",

Love the chillout environment where I can get reading done.I always buy more coffee just to see what interesting things they can draw for me. The desserts are pretty and delectable. Sometimes just too pretty that I wouldnt want to stick the fork in. G spot is the dessert I'd recommend for all chocolate lovers like me. Recommend this place for people who just wanna have some me-time and enjoy a good cuppa (or two or three) If you ever do, invite me along as well.... :p",

Flat white - good coffee but nope I still didn't get my 3D coffee art. sigh2. chocolate gnut - $4 - price is kinda steep for a mini bite size pastry. I have no idea what it is but it kinda tasted like a mini donut hybrid with croissant (cronut) good amount of chocolate cream with every bite but e price ... e price... e price $$$$$3. ham + cheese croissant - $5 this was just OK, wished it came warm but it was kinda cold when i had it.I srsly have to try that eclair next time - looks nomilicious",

Heard and saw pictures of the 3d latte art totally made me want to check it out myself. Coffee beans are from local roastery Liberty Coffee was definitely a plus! Be sure to try out the desserts from the Cordon Bleu pastry chef Gwen Lim who has apparently worked under Pierre Herme himself! Pretty Awesome!",

    "text": "great little cakes at this popular cakery in millenia walk - so popular, in fact, that they've now expanded twice their original size. and for good reason, I think - if the cakes I had were anything to go by, they know their desserts.I finally managed to catch this place when it wasn't maniacally filled with sweet tooths (like mine) - probably because it was about 5 minutes before they closed the cashier. it's very good cake, so it's going to be an easy review: two cakes - a chocolate dome, and a opera-style one (sorry for the lack of titles, but hey, that's what photos are for!)both were surprisingly well done (surprising for hype doesn't always translate to skill) - neat clean layers, crispy p\u00e2te feuillet\u00e9e or biscuit layers playing contrast to the soft, not-too-sweet chocolate mousse/ ganache layers, and prettily shiny glazes to top everything off.I like that there's a good mix of chocolate and other-than options - which span the spectrum from cheesecake to eclair. but these two were plenty lovely, good portions for a post-dinner treat, and very much worth ordering again.service is young but helpful and smiley, and the space is scandinavian white-and-wood and beautiful - clean, neat lines and pretty little desserts that aren't cheap but plenty satisfying, this place is a good one for some post-meal (or actual meal, why not) indulgence.",

I came and held one of my CMYE* Office Hours here around 2 PM on a weekday, and I was amazed at how busy it was. It seems to be a quite popular mid-day hangout for the nearby office workers. I hadn't eaten all day, so I ordered a ham and cheese croissant. To be honest, it wasn't mindblowing, but it took away my hunger pangs. I also had a flat white which tasted perfectly fine to me. :)Everyone else seemed to be enjoying their desserts and coffee, so I'd definitely come back and give those a try sometime!--*CMYE stands for \"Community Manager Yelp Event\", which are casual meet ups hosted by yours truly. :) Office Hours are also when I answer any questions you have about Yelp.

Pastries are good but pricey but I don't mind that. However, having an inedible piece of paper of their logo on the cake is a faux pas to me.",
