    "text": "[Restaurant Week Review]Right in the heart of the CBD, you get a spectacular view of the Marina Bay area.I've always been skeptical of Restaurant Week, because there isn't much to do/show when you limit a restaurant to a certain price point. We came here on a Monday night as a party of 3, and had the trout carpaccio, angus steak, oysters to share (add-on), and a chocolate dessert of sorts.I think Zafferano's has outdone my expectations and blown my RW biasedness out the window. We were surprised by the thick succulent slices of trout, which had a much milder and sweeter flavor vis-\u00e0-vis salmon. They were generous enough, with at least 4 thick slices for an appetizer. The beef was the star of the meal, done just nicely, quite pink (the way I like it), and accompanied by roast potatoes and asparagus. Oysters - just okay, but nobody comes to an Italian place specifically for oysters, hey?The chocolate dessert was your usual, with very nicely tempered white chocolate on top. Must have been a good dessert person hard at work.I thoroughly enjoyed my RW experience here, even if Italian isn't my thing. Yum.",

While they were prepared for this and had a shawl for my partner they really need to turn it down. PLEASE READ ON THOUGH...As soon as I walked in the door to Zafferano the service was outstanding! Our waiter was very friendly with an great sense of humour. There was no pretentious feeling that comes with some fine dining restaurants. The food you ask....Well the food was unreal. I had the ravioli which melted as soon as it touched my mouth. I never knew pasta could be so soft and then exploded with flavours. Then the Pork Belly which equally melts in my mouth. I didn't know Pork could be cooked so well. Lastly the Lava Chocolate Cake. In my experience these can be ultra rich and hard to eat. But of course not at Zafferanos'. It was just right!Thanks to Zafferano for a great night.",

    "text": "It's hard to put much faith in restaurants like these where they occupy the highest floors of any Bayfront buildings (or any restaurant with views). They always tend to be touristy with mediocre food and ultra premium pricing (except Jaan). I was right for this one.I was taken here on a Friday night dinner date and was immediately turned off when I expected the restaurant would have the best views but instead find out that the views can only be seen by people at the outside bar patio area. We are seated at a table against the window that literally stares out at the people at a booth in that outside bar area. It's around 7:30 pm on a Friday evening. Mind you, the restaurant itself is pretty dead but the outside bar was full of the CBD people. However, service was somehow horrible with our server constantly standing on his own never looking at us. My girlfriend ordered a cocktail that tasted horrible and I finished my Negroni and was never offered a second. The waiter acted a bit pretentious and pompous as well. I ordered the oxtail agnolotti and my girlfriend ordered the spinner crab linguine. Note that the linguine isn't freshly made pasta and was very bland. And my agnolotti was okay but nothing special.Our waiter never checked up on us until we had to call him through the very kind gentleman that pours the water and cleans the plates, yet I saw him standing at a distance by himself (again it's a quiet Friday night).Very discouraging experience. You don't even get any view to enjoy unless you go outside. Below average food, poor drinks, terrible service, venue where you don't get a view, not worth the price. Not coming back unless its to have a beer or two in the outside bar area.",

Tomato Mozzarella Salad with Basil - bland, dry and absolutely tasteless until I drowned it in balsamic vinegar that was at the table!2. Spinach and ricotta manicotti type dish - rolled up stuffed pasta tubes - also very bland, and no one even offered me parmesan cheese, which we saw sitting on the counter when we walked out.My husband had the a la carte menu as follows:-1. Tomato and Burratta salad - tastier than my mozzarella salad;2. fettuccine with mushroom and black truffle - this dish was basically like eating raw truffles - they put SO much into the sauce and even shaved more on top, that you only got one ridiculously strong taste of truffles, it was so overpowering and not pleasant!3. Beef short rib cubes - bland and tasteless (again, need to be drowned in vinegar perhaps?!), not to mention quite a contrast from the overpowering fettuccine, and the meat tasted like it was boiled and then slapped on the plate! In addition to the food being sub-par, the service was super slow and inattentive, despite them not being busy at all. \u00a0It took ages to get a glass of wine, bread, or to even get someone's attention to ask for anything.In the end, the prices are absolutely ridiculous for the shoddy service and very below-average food - surprising this place is still in business in such a high-end office building!",

    "text": "Restaurant week experience!I've avoided restaurant week for a few years now, after my last incident with crappy food and food poisoning to boot, so this restaurant was my first after a very long hiatus. I was here with 2 fellow Yelpers on a monday night.Zafferano is located at the top of Ocean Financial Centre at Raffles Place, and there were large windows with awesome views of the Marina Bay area. Good for deep conversations over a dinner date and the like. There's also a cozy outdoor lounge, and I imagine it would be wonderful for drinks after dinner, as it has large glass panels to shield you from the crazy winds 43 storeys up in the air, but still open enough for the occasional gentle breeze.The restaurant was crowded but not packed. We were seated in the middle, near the cool red circular bar in the middle of the restaurant. It was quite dark but I could still see my food so all's good.We had the trout carpaccio, black angus beef + foie gras, oysters to share, and cake (mandorle... - almond wafers, mascarpone cheese, chocolate mousse).The trout carpaccio was delicious, well-marinated (flavourful, not too salty) and smooth. It was quite a large portion, just enough for me to feel satisfied but not stuffed and ready for the next course!Black angus beef was done medium (we couldn't choose because they grill all of them together or something) which was fine by me, still slightly pink in the middle and very soft and tender, not dry/tough at all. The foie gras came at an additional $10 and was ok but not fantastic and I would not recommend adding it to your dish.Oysters were ok and priced decently at $18 for a half-dozen. Not the freshest I've tasted but of acceptable quality.Dessert was nice but nothing too special. I wish there were more of the mousse, while my friends liked the wafer more... you can't please everyone.We ended up paying about $95 per person after the additional foie gras, oysters and wine to go along.I feel that the current 2.5 stars doesn't do this place justice- I'd give it 4 stars for the restaurant week experience! And really, service was decent.",

    "text": "This is my first time in the restaurant, though I had met the restaurant manager Paulo in a previous wine dinner at Robuchon. The restaurant ambience is nice but not especially elegant. Nonetheless service by Bala was attentive and very good. We had a special menu, not all is available on a regular basis. The first course, a wagyu beef carpaccio was excellent, made special by the addition of castelmagno cheese from Piedmont. The pan seared pigeon was special, perfectly seared rare with vanilla reduction which produced an incredible aroma. Tender and flavorful. This pared perfectly with the 2011 Cruanza which has a very strong caramel and vanilla overtone. Then we had the carnaroli \u00a0Saffron risotto, unusually with a pork sausage ragout with toasted rosemary, paired with the Resalte 2010 reserve, a 93 rank wine spectator. What a wine. Elegant, smooth and creamy. Notes of vanilla, burnt caramel and cassis. Full bodied and almost jammy. The risotto was cooked el dente. Perfect. The final dish, a Sous vide rack of lamb, then roasted. Paired with a limited edition grand Resalte 2009, a 90 point Robert Parker. Just like the previous wines, notes of vanilla and caramel. Intense and full bodied, silky smooth and mellow. Exceptionally balanced and complex. Perfect pairing for the dish which was perfectly done, rare and super tender with an intense syrupy jus. The meal finished with a mascarpone valrhona chocolate mousse, a little sweet for my taste although my wife and daughter were fine with it. Overall an excellent dinner. We took a look at the regular menu. A limited selection but based on the meal tonight I have no doubt that it will be well prepared. Prices are reasonable and value for what you get. I recommend this restaurant and will be back for more.",

He appetizer buffet wasn't bad, decent choices with Parma ham, salads etc. once I finished a plate, they quickly removed my cutlery and placed a potholder there in preparation for the pasta. That meant no seconds for the greedy folks out there! Pasta was mediocre and service was a little distracted. But poor execution when two of my colleagues fish mains were undercooked! The bulk of the middle was completely raw and had to be sent back. They were gracious and replaced it with a new dish, but for a restaurant billed to be one the high end, I think it's pretty poor. Dessert was so so and we had to call the waitress over several times to take our coffee and tea orders. I wouldn't come back on my own dime.",

The interior dining area isn't too big, covering just about half the restaurant, the balance has more of a lounge feeling.
