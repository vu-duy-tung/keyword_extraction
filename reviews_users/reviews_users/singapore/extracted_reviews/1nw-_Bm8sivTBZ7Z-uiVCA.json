I don't know, and I don't really care, because I just like coming here (and their other outlets) to get my fill of steaming hot soup dumplings, spinach with sesame dressing and when I'm feeling fancy, drunken chicken. As the other reviewers have pointed out, this place is crowded all the time, so expect there to be a bit of a wait. Once you've ordered though, things move quickly without you feeling rushed. I wish we had more of the Taiwanese menu available here, but this is still bar none my favorite XLB place in town.",

Naturally, once I found out that there was a location minutes away from my hotel in Singapore, I just had to check it out for comparison purposes. Prices are definitely higher, which is no shocking surprise. In the US, it's around $7-8 for a 10 pc of the juicy pork dumplings. In Singapore, it's closer to $11-12. The group of us weren't that hungry, so we only ordered 20 total for 4 people. Not only do they tack on $1 per person for tea (without even asking), but they also automatically added a service charge. So it ended up being close to $30 US dollars.Not a good value, by any means, and the XLB's where just about the same compared to the Arcadia location. If there was a slight difference, the skin was slightly thicker and chewier in Singapore -- which I didn't mind at all. Worth a try, but not again if I'm ever in Singapore again.",

We were in the area because there was a little anime festival going on at Funan mall, and this was the closest thing that served xiao long bao. We were seated promptly, and politely. It was rather cramped- you can tell they're trying to maximize space, and when there's only 2 people in your party... well. But really, we're not big, so we didn't mind rubbing elbows a little. Wound up chatting a bit to a couple of Frenchmen that were dining next to us, actually! (Frenchmen! You never get Frenchmen in Phoenix. I sometimes forget how urbane Singapore is.) The food we ordered was pretty standard. I waffled about getting the truffle xiao long bao but decided against it, going instead for the regular order of that, plus the signature jiao zi. My girlfriend got the dan dan mien, I got the zha jiang mien. We also shared the pickled shredded vegetables. Everything was pretty good- the skin on the bao thin, the broth hot. My zha jiang mien was delicious, and definitely better than what I could replicate at home. Mostly it was just a good fix of chinese food, and the coveted xiao long bao. I don't get a chance to have food like this back in Phoenix. 3.5 stars out of 5 for sure. Didn't round up as #1- it's a chain restaurant and #2, really nothing out of this world. Good solid fare, in a nice, air conditioned environment. WIN for me.",

Food appears promptly, and they're a polished operation. (Which can't be said of every Din Tai Fung I've tried in Singapore)This is the Joshua list of what you MUST try at Din Tai Fung. Okay. Maybe not 'must' try. It's MY list after all. But trust me, these are some of the best things on the menu.Xiao Long Bao. The normal kind with pork.Xiao Long Bao WITH BLACK TRUFFLE. Now I know they're expensive at about $4 a pop, but HOT DIGGIDY DAMN they ARE GOOD. They're worth that $4, trust you me. The dumplings in chili oil and vinegar. These are so tasty it's ridonkulous. Eat them dumplings up, and keep a little of the oil and vinegar mix so you can dump it in the...Double boiled chicken soup with noodles.This is the one where the noodles and the soup come separate. The noodles are dry, in a bowl with spring onion and salt, and you're supposed to pour in some soup. BUT WAIT. We have that awesome vinegar chili oil mix still left over. POUR THAT IN. Spoon in 2-3 spoons of soup. And SAVOUR.Also definitely worth trying is the Shanghai drunken chicken. PACKED with flavour, this is my favourite cold starter item on the menu.Also generally well liked is the prawn pancake, which is crisp, seafoody goodness.OMG I need some XLB right now.",

The chicken soup is also really tasty, as is the beef soup. We also really like the fried rice which is one of the best we've had.

Their top seller is definitely their Xiao Long Baos, which are soup dumplings with pork fillings. They explode in your mouth with a soupy broth that tastes both rich and thick at the same time, one of the best in Singapore! One of my recent discoveries was their Yam Dumplings, which are usually served as dessert dumplings. It's a sweet dumpling, filled with a soft and finely milled yam paste that isn't too cloyingly sweet. Aside from their dumplings, they also serve a great Bean Paste Noodles, that is mixed with \u00a0minced pork and tofu to give it a more Oriental feel compared to its Korean influences. Their Pork Chop Fried Rice, which sounds unassuming, is also deliciously crispy but thick served with steaming fragrant rice fried with battered eggs. Service is always as prompt as they can, given the perpetual long queues. But seating arrangements are always well organized with a numbered system. Hot chinese tea is also served free-flow throughout your meal, and continuously filled to the point where you filled obliged to drink several pots before saying No!",

Their Taiwan Shrimp and Pork Oriental Wantons with Spicy Sauce bring a fiery twist to the normal pork dumplings. These bite-sized dumplings are generously doused with chili oil and black vinegar, bringing out the flavor of the pork and shrimp. Another simple yet fulfilling dish to try is their Fried Rice with Pork Chop. The fried rice is cooked till fragrant, while the pork chop is tender and savory. If you seek a heavier meal, then the Minced Meat Noodles would satisfy you. The noodles are smooth while the saltiness and flavor of the sauce makes it appetizing. The food can be a tad oily, so be sure to order some Chinese Tea to flush it down.",

I'm glad I read reviews of Din Tai Fung because I made the effort to find it and ended up going three times during a two week trip! My hotel (the Swissotel) was connected to the Raffles City mall, so that made it very convenient, but I still would have made the effort to go back. There was usually a line but it cleared quickly and the hostesses provided order sheets and menus so you could decide on your meal before you sat down. One of my favorite parts of the experience was the \"crib\" they provide for ladies' bags and that once you put your bag inside they cover it with a napkin as if the bags are being tucked in for a nap. But my most favorite thing were the dumplings. These soup dumplings might be the most delightful thing I have ever eaten. The sensation of putting one in your mouth and the warm soup bursting out (yeah, yeah, *phrasing boom*) just brings a smile to your face. The texture of the dumplings is firm, but soft, and the soup has great flavor. I tried several varieties, with the traditional pork being my favorite. The shrimp and the chicken were also good, but I didn't care for the crab very much. I also tried the shrimp fried rice and an eggplant side dish and both were great. I've seriously been telling everyone about these dumplings since I went on this trip. If you're in Singapore, Din Tai Fung is a must.",

I figured I'd try it in SE Asia. the second time there I waited for a single table almost one hour. the service is lousy. a runner just dumps the dish on the table and leaves without checking if it's correct or you need anything else. but the worst part was the xiao long bao, both times, was dried out like it had been sitting on a warming shelf for a while. this is supposed to be the reason people come here. my order was wrong one of the times, but I was too annoyed at waiting an hour so I didn't complain. the sides were okay.I'll never come back",

    "text": "I finally got to try the Din Tai Fung's famous steamed pork dumplings. There's a location in the Raffles City shopping center. The verdict: pretty tasty! How do they make these? How do they get the soup to stay inside? The meat and the dumpling itself was delicious, but I wouldn't say it was mind blowing. Maybe I had high expectations because it was so hyped up. I also tried the steamed chicken soup, because the menu said it was another thing they were famous for. I didn't like this as much. I thought the broth was kind of bland and most of the chicken was white meat, so slightly dry.They give you a pen and you have to mark down how many of each item you want. For the dumplings, you have the option of getting six pieces or ten pieces. And it comes out in one of those bamboo steamer baskets. Overall, tasty dumplings, but nothing to go out of your way for!",

There was typically a wait if you came at normal eating hours, and even off peak there were always plenty of tables filled up! I do like the numbering system and how they call out the tables, easier to hear than names being called and lets you not stand in a line like other places in the mall. Service was typically quick, although items came out as they were ready and not necessarily in the order that you would expect them. This didn't bother me as i was eating alone, but might be weird if you are in a group and ordering separately. Although this is a chain, i felt that this location was a nice option for dinner for almost any occasion from date night to casual eating alone. I think you have to visit one location of this restaurant if you are visiting Singapore!",

Few restaurants have inspired such loyalty from me and that's simply owing to their reliable dim sum with consistent quality. Not to say there aren't ANY cons. The waiting time can range from 10-30 minutes on the weekends although they are kind enough to let you pick your food while you wait and make your order just as you are whisked to a table. The menu is a bit limited in my opinion. No char siew pau or chee cheong fun, two staples on the dim sum menu. It's also not particularly adventurous if you are into that sort of thing. Having said that, whatever they do serve is very good promptly dished. The pork and chilli crab steamed bun is delicious, as is their soup dumplings. I'm also a sucker for their mango pudding which I never have space for because I've just gorged on 6 prawn and pork dumplings. If you want some otherworldly dim sum, you won't get it here. If you just want a straightforward, good dumpling, this place will not fail you.",

There wasn't anything \u00a0particularly wrong with it but it lacked layers of flavours that would have brought it up a notch.tinyurl.com/md9rrdpChicken with wine sauce - This was such a enjoyable chicken dish. \u00a0it is another example of a dish that allowed the basic ingredient to shine through. \u00a0The wine sauce complimented the chicken without overwhelming it. \u00a0Plus, the chicken was very tender.tinyurl.com/lyzsb9gPrawn Fried Rice - I love rice. \u00a0But I tend to prefer steamed rices. \u00a0However, if I keep running into fried rices as good as this, I may become a convert. \u00a0It was light. \u00a0The prawns were sweet. \u00a0The eggs provided a rich earthy note. \u00a0At some level, it was difficult to believe this was a fried dish.tinyurl.com/kcpztlbCold Pork - I enjoyed the flavours of this dish. \u00a0The lightness of the pork. \u00a0The freshness of the onions. \u00a0The nice touch of the sesame seeds. \u00a0All that being said, I would prefer this dish with the pork served hot.tinyurl.com/mc6hn5jPrawn Dumplings - I love prawn dumplings. \u00a0These were very good. \u00a0Fresh, hot, sweet, etc..tinyurl.com/lpqr9n5Xia Long Bao (soup dumplings) - This is the dish that brings a lot of folks to Din Tai Fung. \u00a0 They did not disappoint. \u00a0Dipped into the vinegar and ginger and then popped into your mouth for a flavour explosion. \u00a0Just make sure not to burn yourself.tinyurl.com/m7efulrI do not know the cost. \u00a0My friends were kind enough to treat me to dinner.Overall - Din Tai Fung is about the food and they delivered. \u00a0For the overall experience, I would say this was more 3.5 star than 4. \u00a0The food definitely warranted 4 stars. \u00a0The service could be a little more personable and little less rushed. \u00a0 But, I guess if they didn't hurry, we would all have to wait a little longer to get our delicious Xia Long Bao.",
