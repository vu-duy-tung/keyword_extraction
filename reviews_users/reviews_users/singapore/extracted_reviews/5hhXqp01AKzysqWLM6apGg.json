    "text": "I am a strong supporter of bicycles as a mean of transport, and I sometimes miss those Sundays back home when they close some main avenues so we can cycle just for recreation. No wonder any kind of place devoted to cyclists will always catch my attention.Wheeler's Yard is on a quiet area in the border between Whampoa and Toa Payoh. The restaurant is inside a spacious industrial warehouse, sharing the massive space with a bicycle shop and self-labeled atelier. In a time of crammed cafes and confined restaurants dubbed as \"intimate\", the high ceilings and massive tables of the restaurant are a delight. The whole place is a vintage paradise, highly appealing to architectural restoration enthusiasts. They basically kept as much as they could from the original warehouse and made the restaurant and atelier fit in there, creating a vast place with a warm atmosphere, ideal for groups and sharing.The menu is varied, with some Japanese inspiration and local ingredients. I had a nicely done pan-seared snapper served in a small pool of fragrant mushroom stock. It was not spectacular, but the flavours were wisely balanced. My wife had a sous vide chicken, which was juicy and fairly tasty. We also had the truffle fries, which we liked a lot. They have a small, careful selection of local craft beers at reasonable prices. Another plus is they don't impose service charge, since the place actually works on a self service basis. The food prices are not those of a self-service place, though.All in all, Wheeler's Yard works as a retreat from the race of the chase. It feels ideal for a quiet afternoon in Whampoa (which is quiet enough itself). I can imagine myself arriving there after a long and tiring urban cycle ride. Yeah, that's going on my list.",

The high ceilings and spacious arrangement doesn't give a claustrophobic feeling. Best thing is, I don't need to sit elbow to elbow with people and fit for a good cup of coffee. The servers pretty much leave you alone most of the time so don't expect service here. It's something that I don't mind when I prefer to just concentrate on my laptop and my readings. Food wise- the fries are a must-try. My friend and I made a mistake of ordering our mains AND fries. The portion is so huge that even on its own, the two of us could not have finished it. The big breakfast set is rather big also. However, the price did leave a huge hole in my pocket. Overall, good place you want to have some quality time with friends or by yourself.",

I love how you picked up on today's industrial decor trend and morphed your huge warehouse to house all three concepts.I'm not a bike rider, so I can't comment on your sweet looking bikes, but I am an eater and drinker, so I will give you my 2 cents on that! Your calamari is a great starter; LOVE the sauce it's drenched in though the squid was a bit too chewy at times. Your Caesar salad is my second favourite in Singapore (next to, you guessed it, Salad Stop's haha.) I love how you give me those cute little cookies to go with my coffee, and how I have a good choice of ciders if I'm in the mood for one.And how can I say no to the easily accessible pitchers of ice water, some which are displayed on the back of a bike?I normally decide to cool down in your air conditioned cafe, where I enjoy listening to your awesome pop playlist. I love how I spot neighbours of all ages hanging out here and in the al fresco dining area too. Basically, you know how to appeal to the local community, and you're doing it all right. And hey, you're even willing to serve not-cool-enough people like myself with a smile, so you get all the stars for that!",

A big blue door on front of a warehouse doesn't hint at what's behind... but the people standing in front of it madly taking selfies indicates that perhaps something interesting is going on inside.Walk down the side alley and through a big open door and you suddenly realise that this place is choc-full with people drinking coffee and eating brunch. I'm not talking just a dozen people, but a hundred, maybe more! There's two areas to sit. Behind the glass doors, you might be lucky to score a seat on the big communal table where you can read magazines and relax in AC comfort. Outside there's more seating and also the view of the bicycle workshop where you can buy a funky bike or bring yours to be serviced. I spied some cute kids helmets sporting animal faces, and only wished they came in big-kid sizes!We stopped in for drinks only - there's coffee and tea, interesting soft drinks and also a small selection of beers. But many visitors were sharing piles of fries, sweets and brunchy items that looked appetising.It's great to see that the entrepreneurial F&B world is alive and kicking here in Singapore and if Wheeler's Yard is a sign of more fun things to come, then it's safe to say that Singaporeans have a lot to look forward to when it comes to innovative venues.",

We went for Sunday brunch and between everyone at the table sampled quite a few items on the menu. I had the Ultimate Beef Yard burger and my wife had the Big Breakfast. My burger was slightly undercooked and VERY greasy and the fries (which I had heard good things about) were dry and overcooked. The breakfast items were rather bland as well. Prices (as mentioned in other reviews) are not cheap and frankly very inflated for the quality. The place is fun to visit and I suspect that's what you pay for. It is family friendly but very, very noisy for lunch on a Sunday - don't expect any intimate conversation. I think this is a low 3 star rating due only to the quirky fun atmosphere but I would not return for the food.",

Nestled within an industrial warehouse, it's like a hidden gem that's waiting to be uncovered. The ambience within the cafe is certainly unique - with its high ceiling, warm lighting and consistent bicycle theme. It felt like a place where one could relax and chat with friends for hours. The food and drinks were definitely pricey, especially considering the location and the fact that everything is self-service. We were there too early for dinner, so we ordered a bowl of truffle fries to share ($14.90, i think).The truffle fries were AMAZING. The moment the bowl was set on the table in front of me, I was hit by the aroma of truffles. That was when I knew this was going to be an experience to remember. The fries were hot and crispy and the chef was definitely liberal with the truffle oil and grated cheese. The portion was just right for 2 people, and we polished it off in no time. The truffle aroma stayed with us for the rest of the night, even through dinner. I'm still gushing over it. We'll definitely go back again.",

Seriously?I agree the front door is nice.. Inside is a nice concept too. But it doesn't justify the price. For cheaper and better (food) I would go to Jewel cafe instead... It's 15mins away but I'll not feel like raped off on Saturday or Sunday morning for brunch. I tried it once, I'll not go there anymore for sure.",

    "text": "A place like this exists in Singapore, holy schnikes! Texas barnyard meets Novena hustle & bustle. At the onset, when you first lay your eyes on this beauty, you begin to wonder, \"this place looks out of place doesn't it?\" You walk inside this pimped out barnyard and you concur, \"this place is really out of place!\" But I guess, that is part of the charm of Wheelers Yard, a huge pimped out warehouse located in a quiet street corner of Novena with neighborhood Aunties and Uncles as regular customers.Inside this proverbial barn is a restaurant, bike shop, a pop-up bar/cider stand, and what I swear is a stage concert. Literally, the place can turned into anything the owner desires. \u00a0In terms of the food, the Fried Calamari dipped in black sweet sauce is a MUST try. I know I sound like a broken record that this and that is the Best in Singapore. But, why not, I'll say it again, the Best Calamari dish in Singapore. The Calamari portions are huge, even for Singapore and the Sauce was well... the bomb diggitty. The Prawn Aglio Olio, which I seem to try at every restaurant, was good, but doesn't compare to Starker down the road. I didn't try the bbq ribs, but I might as well have had it since my fellow communal seating partner was gorging himself right next to me. Based on his reaction after every bite, it must have been good or at least worth the consideration. \u00a0Overall, Wheelers Yard is a MUST SEE cafe and truly embodies the creativity of Singapore and its people.",

    "text": "I found a review online that mentioned the Ribeye steak was worth a shot! Steak in a cafe didn't seem like the natural option but none of the other items on the menu impressed me much so I decided to go for it! What's the worst that could happen? $27 wasted and a sad face. Boy! Was I glad I decided to take the path less travelled! The Ribeye steak was delicious (I had it medium done)! Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about their burgers! My friend asked the cashier, \"what's good here?\"She replied, \"up to you lor\"Unsatisfied with the answer I chimed in, \"but what would you recommend?\"She asked, \"the burger\" He decided to go with her recommendation but we weren't impressed. The meat was subpar. It tasted kinda chewy and over marinated... kinda like cheap sausage meat grounded into a patty? Either she has poor taste or she gave him really bad information. Coffee-wise, I really didn't think that they were as good as Nylon etc. Passable but it wasn't impressive.Service was also rather slow that day. My steak came out on time but my friends' food didn't. Ambiance-wise, Wheeler is unbeatable! A beautiful hipster cafe! I love the concept and the deco. Not so much the location and the parking. There's barely enough lots to fit 5% of the customers. They only have 4 lots out front. All 4 were taken when we arrived. Plus, the remote location (an industrial like area) didn't really help because it wasn't very accessible via public transportation so I wished they had more parking space!",

It tasted like something out of a can... And why aren't the servers patrolling to see if customers have needs? They just stand behind the counter and chatting away. I was once a part-time waiter back in \u00a0UNI, so u must prove ur value. My 2cents: minimum care only gets u minimum wage.",

    "text": "The hype over the locality of this place, an industrial space functioning both as a bike atelier and a cafe at the same time, Wheeler's Yard is a place where you can get unique bicycles while also having western food items and drinks!The food menu is rather extensive here.And the drinks menu! Rather simple.The Latte ($5) tasted ok with the right amount of milk added. Nothing too great.The Big Breakfast ($14.90) is served with a wholemeal bread toast, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hashbrown & garden salad. This is way better than the coffee although not overwhelming as well. The toast was rather nicely toasted and crusty. The scrambled eggs are nice. The bacon is great. The sausages and the hashbrown are average. The garden salad is also not too bad. In overall, this could have been better.If you live or is around the Balestier area, this place should be considered to have your meal (for its ambience; do not expect too much from the food and drinks)",
