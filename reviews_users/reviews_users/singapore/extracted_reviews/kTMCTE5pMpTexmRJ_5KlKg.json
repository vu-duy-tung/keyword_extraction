    "text": "A trip to Japan has it drawbacks for me: after being spoiled with the most awesome food whilst being there, I suffer from serious Japanese food cravings after returning from Japan for quite a while. So I went to search for a sashimi fix and found this restaurant at the nearby Dempsey Hill.For a Friday evening it was suspiciously empty but this allowed me to get a prime seat at their \u00a0bar which has a very tempting display of fresh seafood. Also, the service was quick and correct since there was a lot of waitstaff available.As the oysters were recommended on social media, I went for two oysters, a chirashi with a selection of sashimi and deep fried shrimp. Obviously I paired it with a jug of sake to make the feast complete. The food was of good quality and I was pleased with my sake (which the waitress helped me pick) so I managed to satisfy my craving.Is it as good as in Japan? No, but it was one of the better mid range Japanese I had in Singapore, I will certainly return when I want to treat myself to decent Japanese food.",

I don't remember what I ate. But I was full... Physiological goal achieved. 4 stars for prompt service and serving despite lunch crowd. Which was what I needed. Objective reached.",

    "text": "Overall the food was pretty good but don't think it's worth the price. The two of us spent 100 bucks per person getting the following things:1. oyster with yuzu sauce. My favorite dish of the night. The yuzu sauce with zesty lemon goes perfectly with those oysters2. Chawanmushi. I always have a soft spot for steamed egg, and they do it pretty well here.3. A sashimi platter for two of about 14 pieces. The fish was okay, not super impressed.4. some shishito pepper and shitake mushroom yakitori. I like the shishito pepper really charred but they don't cook it to that extent. And you can't possibly mess up shitake mushroom?5. Green tea icecream. Don't think it's homemade, tastes pretty standard.Again, it wasn't a bad meal but you can get more bang for the buck elsewhere.",

    "text": "For full reviews and pictures, visit my blog,Heard from my friends that it's not easy to get a table at the Far East Shopping Center outlet, which is quite booked but no such issues with the one at Dempsey. If you like your sashimi and Aburi sushi, this is really a place to visit. Love the buttery and smooth texture of the fish, indicative of fresh and not frozen fishes. They are served with freshly grated wasabi, which IMO is a indicator of a quality Japanese restaurant. Oyster lovers would be glad to know that the ones served here are ginormous. The mini course or the bento set is really value for money considering the amount and quality of food. Perfect for sharing (for 2) with an additional side dish. Highlight of the meal has got to be the Aburi platter. The meat was simply sublime and each piece was drizzled in a different cream/miso sauce. Perfect torching technique as i've previously highlighted in my Kaiho Sushi review. The kita-komachi rice, one of the best rice in Japan, accompanies the fish, adding that light vinegarish and sweet dimension. The little charred spots bring in some smokiness too.",

    "text": "Rakuichi Japanese Restaurant prides itself as one of the most authentic Japanese restaurant in Singapore. Speaking to the manager he mentioned to me how the cuisine only uses the best quality and freshest ingredients, of course imported from Japan. I don't know whether it was the way he described the ingredients, but when the food came, the taste of authenticity and freshness were definitely there. It was delicious. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxed, it's a great place to be silent and enjoy a good meal.It is one of the older establishments situated at Dempsey. The parking obviously is great, and the atmosphere somewhat like Robertson quay, is very much so westernised.There is a wide selection to choose from, it may be a little pricey, but definitely worth it.",

    "text": "Located at a quiet corner of Dempsey hill, Rakuichi is a good place to sit outdoors with plenty of sake and yakitori. And there are smoking tables available! Inside, you have a choice of seating at the sushi bar counter or on traditional Japanese dining rooms (the type where you sit on the floor) or normal tables, depending on the mood of the group you're with. The set dinners are reasonably priced and look really delicious though \u00a0have not had the chance to try their lunch or dinner sets yet. Price wise, it is slightly on the high side at around $40 -$60 per person. OCBC credit card owners get to enjoy 10% off, so make sure you make full use of it!",

    "text": "Now - I'm not a big fan of Japanese food (yeah I know, how is that possible). But I've been to quite a few Jap restaurants thanks to friends who are more than enthusiastic about Jap food. Rakuichi is a pleasant restaurant. Decor-wise, it doesn't differ very much from the typical Jap restaurant. The food's good though. The aburi sushi scores with its good looks - distinct morsels of yummy-looking sushi. Every piece was tasty, right down to the humble tamago. Only minor gripe is that the chefs were a little too heavy handed with the unagi sauce. \u00a0 The sashimi was fresh. I liked the wasabi. The grilled beef and beef tongue skewers were surprisingly tasty. Assorted sushi we ordered were all about there. Deserts and desert selection were nothing to shout about though.I didn't pay for dinner (thanks LF!) so not too sure about prices. From what I remembered of the menu, prices were pretty decent. Staff were polite.Guys - if you are inclined towards washing your hands after using the toilet (I know many of you don't), be gentle on the soap dispenser. \u00a0A press and soap spurted all over my right sleeve, which took quite a bit of dabbing with paper towels to partially remove. On the plus side, I did exit the toilet smelling fresher than when I entered...",
