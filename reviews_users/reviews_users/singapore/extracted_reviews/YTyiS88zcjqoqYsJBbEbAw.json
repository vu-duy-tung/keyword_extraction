    "text": "not the easiest to find but quite easily the best prata around, especially their coin pratas!never had coin pratas before?they are made from the same hand stretched, palm flattened, artisan flipped and thus aerated dough, which instead of becoming the regularly shaped flat breads, is transformed into coin-like loose concentric binds thus resulting in a higher concentration of crispy surface yet retaining plentiful soft chewy interior(like a good croissant) to better complement and soak up the ever so essential pairing that is a curry or for the non curry tolerant, sugar!WARNING: the curry here is indeed NSFKids and maybe even some adults! side effects may include uncontrolled perspiration and unquenchable heat on the palate. it is however a balanced spiciness flavoured by your choice of protein(chicken, mutton, fish or squid) or in my case proteins!the fish curry gravy, in my opinion, serves as the best savoury dip however the tender mutton rib, chicken drumstick and/or the soft sensual squid are all better consumption options.so get the protein that you like but always ask for a side of the fish curry gravy to drown your pratas.it is almost impossible not to see a line forming in front of their stall, constantly stretching beyond and in annoyance of the neighbouring mixed rice stall.if there isn't a queue, like the one time i experienced, it is because they are closed and any elation turns swiftly into grief!!!the brothers running the show look uncannily alike but are, confirm plus chop, not twins!the more senior of the two has such good bed side manners and command of the english language unseen at hawker stalls and is almost too cool in the face of a non-stop onslaught of fervent fans! yes, take that weekday off, if need be, and acquaint yourself with some die die must try coin pratas here!",

The regular prata is also pretty good - the right mix of crispy and fluffy. The chicken curry that comes with is also very tender.All in all one of my must haves when I'm back in Singapore! Also the French toast Kaya toast at the drink store is an absolute must have!!!!",

It's also very tasty. My girls had the coin Prata and I tried one too. It's crispy on the outside yet kinda soft on the inside. Very good combination indeed. The curry gravy is the best! Spicy, tasty and full-bodied. Prata drowned in the curry is just awesome!!!Definitely coming back again for more goodness!",

    "text": "I'd heard that this was one of the best pratas around, but my experience was rather disappointing. 50 minutes of queuing to order aside (luckily I got the food within a few minutes of ordering), the food quality was very mixed.The egg prata was downright lousy. There's no other word for it. It had not a shade of crispiness at all.The plain prata was alright, being fluffy enough (and a little crispy).What pulled down these two were, I suspect, the mass production, with the staff flipping them on and off the griddle at a quick pace. Despite the quick turnover, the quality suffered, which was surprising.My 2 other orders were more unique and they turned out much better.The cheese prata was pretty good. It was crispy and light (though it was a bit lighter on the cheese than other places). Take out the cheese inside and it would be everything a plain prata should be.The best of all was the bomb prata (prata with margarine and sugar inside). Most bomb prata is very dense and heavy-tasting (which is not necessarily a bad thing) but the bomb here was very light and flaky, and even those with an aversion to oil and/or sugar would probably not find this one too oily and/or sweet (then again, if you don't like oil you shouldn't be eating roti prata in the first place).Oh, and despite the reviews here they weren't selling coin prata that day. Possibly because of the long queue (it only comes in a set, for one).Where this place shone was the curry. The fish curry was robust and full of flavour (and also a little spicy), rather than being the watered down slop you find at many places.",

This place is just a mere 2 or 3 blocks away from Prata House and I'm surprised not many people have talked about this place. Ok, the prata IS a bit smaller BUT it's fatter and tastier than Prata House IMO. The curry? The bomb! I had regular curry, so if you're wondering about the fish or chicken curries, I don't know. But I've heard that the fish curry there is good, even for people that don't enjoy fish. Oh, did I mention it's cheaper than Prata House?! Because it is! I got 1 egg & onion prata w/ regular curry for $1.80.",

The curry is also packed with spices- it's not one of those watered-down curries. The ones they serve probably can give you a sweat. \u00a0My favorites include the coin prata and cheese prata. The plain prata is also nice- just make sure that you get the hottest and freshest batch. You may need to wait a while for the fresh batch but I can guarantee that it's worth the wait.",

    "text": "Sin Ming Roti Prata is a stall tucked away in a corner of a coffee shop along Sin Ming road. This stall is located across the road from LTA office. Although it is not prominently located, it has garnered quite a following. Many have raved that Sin Ming Roti Prata is the best prata stall. In addition, I know of some who would drive down specially just to satisfy their prata cravings. Hence, upon hearing all these, I just had to check this out.Sin Ming Roti Prata does not only sell pratas. They also sell Nasi Briyani, Nasi Goreng, Mee Goreng, Mutton and even Curry Fish Head. Nevertheless, their prata seems to be more popular. I ordered a Plain Prata $0.90 and an Egg Prata $1.50. I had to wait for around 15 minutes as there was several customers ahead of me. The pratas are made freshly and cooked on the spot upon order which is something that I appreciate. Nothing beats freshly made and freshly cooked prata!How was the prata? The exterior of the Plain Prata was slightly crispy while the interior was soft and chewy. I was disappointed at the lack of crispiness and also felt that it was too chewy. The shiokness of the crispiness and soft combination was lacking. As for the Egg Prata it was similar, lacking in the crisp factor. The fish curry was good, but not fantastic.I like my prata crispy, so well this is not for me. For me, I would still prefer having my prata from the Prata Place. Somehow, I did not feel satisfied with the prata from Sin Ming Roti Prata. If you prefer a less crispy (soft) and chewy prata, then this is for you! Its a matter of personal preference. Which type of prata do you prefer? Crispy or soft? Detailed review: foodiefc.blogspot.sg/201\u2026",
