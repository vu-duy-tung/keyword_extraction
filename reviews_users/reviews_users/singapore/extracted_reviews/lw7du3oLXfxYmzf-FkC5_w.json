Yes its huge. And good...but wow.Great place for live music and salsa. My friend was a constant fixture here years (sorry ladies! He's now gone). But great spot for ppl spying and atmosphere.",

I usually try to take it easy and to not to be hard on people who work at places like this because I understand how energy taking it can be but here I cannot let it go. Although the food and beer was good but never come here again.",

    "text": "The people that work there are terribly rude. While we were there one of my friends who is pregnant was hit in the arm by the security guy, then a woman who works there (we don't know if she runs the place or not ) told my friend to get out of the bar using very offensive language. \u00a0The \"rules violation\" my friend committed was to step onto the stage and take a picture while it was unoccupied by the band and she didn't touch any of the musical instruments. We left the place with my friend crying, we had to call the police, and they came and filed a report.I was telling the story to one of my friends a few days later and he told me that something similar happened to one of his friends there too. They also called the police. So this is not an isolated instance. \u00a0The management of this place is terrible. I'm spreading the word so other people are aware of what is happening there.",

    "text": "According to a colleague, cuba libre has the best mojitos. When asked what's the criterion for a good mojito, she said, the Mint and sugar cane first then rum aftertaste. For $24 a huge glass almost like a pitcher, you get an alcohol packed drink that guarantees highness. Ok that depends on how good a drinker are you. I guess it's quite worth the money. What's best to have with the mojito? Nachos. For 14 bucks, you get a huge pile of corn chips with a pile of beef or chicken con carne, salsa and cheese. It's awesome! Ok maybe it's the alcohol talking at the point but it is indeed better than brewerkz.So if you want an afternoon drink or to chill out after work, this is quite a good place to go.",

    "text": "While this is not the worst restaurant I've ever been to, it is a far cry from \"real\" Cuban/Mexican food. \u00a0First of all, the menu is focused on Mexican standards, not Cuban ones. \u00a0They don't even serve Cuban sandwiches! \u00a0How can you have a Cuban restaurant and not serve Cuban sandwiches?The food and drinks are ridiculously overpriced for what you get. \u00a0I ordered chicken and mango quesadillas, which came with a selection of two \"salsas or dips.\" \u00a0The portions were very small, to the point that it looked more like an appetizer than an entree, and both my \"dips,\" combined, wouldn't have filled a shot glass. \u00a0My friend ordered enchiladas, which came out after I had already finished my entire entree, with no explanation whatsoever for the delay in service. \u00a0I'm pretty sure she wouldn't have been served at all if she hadn't flagged down a waiter to ask where her entree was.The food itself was very generic. \u00a0The guacamole seemed to be pureed avocados with no seasonings or texture whatsoever. \u00a0My friend said the cheese on her enchilada was basically just microwaved Velveeta.The service was also terrible. \u00a0It took forever for the servers to provide our food, provide the check, and return my credit card and receipt. \u00a0When a server overheard me complaining to my friend about the delay with my receipt (seriously, it took at least 15 minutes for them to bring it back), he simply said there was a \"problem in the back\" and that they'd bring it out soon.For the location and cost, I'd expect much better than tiny, flavorless Mexican dishes that don't even come out of the ktichen at the same time, and waitstaff that actually waits on their customers, rather than ignoring them entirely. \u00a0There are plenty of better options in Clarke Quay, including at least 2 other Mexican restaurants. \u00a0I'd pick either of them over Cuba Libre.",

If you've had actual Mexican food before then run for the hills, not that we were looking for authentic. Didn't think it was possible to screw up nachos till this experience.",
