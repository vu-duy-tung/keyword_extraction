    "text": "On a muggy summer Singapore day, my sister and I were wandering around after we got in, with no real plan in mind. Some deity must have been guiding us to the City Square Mall, because we walked in and almost immediately saw Din Tai Fung--it was like the mothership calling us home. Neither of us has visited any of the locations in the States, but it's been on my to-try list for YEARS. I immediately started chanting \"DTF! DTF! DTF!\" because I'm an adult, and despite neither of us being hungry, we obviously had to take advantage of there not being a wait, and were immediately seated. It was shockingly hoppin' for around 1pm on a Tuesday. We had to wait a bit of time before our order sheet was picked up, but it wasn't really a big deal because there were so many things to look at and we were really just very excited. If I possessed the talent, I would compose an 8-minute, full-orchestra love ballad for DTF's xiao long bao. It was love at first site. I didn't even have to taste them to know that we were soulmates. But luckily, I powered through and indeed was able to experience the full glory of the XLB. The dumpling skins were astoundingly thin, and melted in your mouth immediately. The filling was cooked to absolute perfection, a perfect symphony of flavors without being too salty (like many other restaurants seem to lean), and the flavorful broth explosion is the most delightful experience in the world. All you've got to do is top it off with some ginger/soy/vinegar mix and a hearty drop or eight of chili oil. We very quickly finished off our ten-dump steamer and were super bummed that we didn't get six additional orders. Rookie mistake. I now wake up every day craving the beautiful, perfect dumplings that I met in Singapore. Guess I'll just have to road trip to California to get my fix!",

    "text": "My friends have been hyping up Din Tai Fung for a long time, so I finally decided to try it. It was lunchtime on a weekday and wasn't too busy inside. There were many open tables, so we were seated right away. We waited about 20 minutes for our Xiao Long Bao, but it was worth the wait. It was fresh and delicious! We ordered some other things too: some vegetables and desserts. But the star of the show was definitely the Xiao Long Bao.In terms of service, it wasn't great. It was very hard to get our server's attention for water refills and even just to order food.",

    "text": "Funny enough, I haven't tried a Din Tai Fung in US, so I was pleasantly surprised to find one at this Singapore mall in search for soft serve. I decided that I had some stomach space after scoffing down a huge black sesame soft serve, so asked for a table for one. Being a pescetarian in Asia was pretty hard since they put pork in just about every shrimp dumpling there. It's like haven't you heard of egg to use as a binding agent? So I ordered the vegetarian dumplings that they had there and red bean bun as well as a refreshing dessert to complete the meal. Overall, my meal was pretty tasty and I would come back again, but maybe try one in the states that hopefully caters to my pescetarian diet.",

    "text": "Being from California and having a ton of spoiled foodie friends, I've heard about the infamous Din Tai Fung for years. But because I'm naturally impatient and easily get hangry, I've never bothered to get in the hour-plus long queue that accompanies the DTF (ha, that's what she said) locations in the states. My sister and I arrived in Singapore on an early flight and had a few hours to kill before our hotel check in, so naturally we went in search of food. We were actually on the hunt for dessert, but stumbled upon this location within the City Square Mall and were pleasantly surprised there was no wait at all! We both went from \"eh, I'm not really hungry\" to drooling over their entire menu in about two seconds flat. We started with the duck in crispy spring onion pastry appetizer - slices of decadent smoked duck with a strip of delicious fatty skin attached, wrapped in paper thin spring roll skin that is somehow crispy and light without being the least bit oily. Though the pieces are small, they are definitely rich, and probably could've used a few more sprigs of green onion to cut the richness. Now onto the star of the show and the reason we're all here... the XLB is freaking amazing! We went with the classic pork soup dumplings. I heard a rumor that the chefs here in the kitchen have to complete a two year apprenticeship, and it definitely shows in the quality of these babies! Each soup dumpling is like a beautifully wrapped present for my taste buds and ever expanding foodie belly. The dumpling skin is thin and just melts as soon as you put it into your mouth, yet is durable enough so you don't lose any of that precious soup even if your chopstick skills aren't up to snuff and you accidentally manhandle them a bit. The pork filling is rich and flavorful, as is the broth that its bathed in. As for the dipping sauce, they give you a small dish of super fresh julienned ginger, and there is soy sauce and vinegar on the table to mix to your heart's content. Do yourself and favor and add a dollop or their chili oil to just about anything - that stuff is freaking LEGIT. I can honestly say that the XLB at Din Tai Fung lives up to the hype, and I'll gladly stand in line for another taste.",
