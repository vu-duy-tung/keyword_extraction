    "text": "extremely disappointed. seated outside, which was a good sign, then everything downhill. ordered drinks (wildly overpriced), appetizer (was highlight of the meal, should have left while ahead), then main courses: chili crab (the \"small\" was 1.6kg s$125. now think about that - s$125!!) + 2 other mains + fried rice. the waiter brought 1 main, and we waited for the other 2 + the rice, which was not served with the 1st. then the 2nd main arrived after the 1st was cold, still no chili crab!!?? lost appetite, cancelled the chili crab which sent everyone berserk. insult to injury, they brought the fried rice last. needless to say, not a good food time. the hostess apologized, big deal, the meal was ruined. thankfully, the company was great and we ignored the terrible service. we will never return for several reasons: restaurant is a tourist trap (don't understand why anyone would go, but then again never underestimate stupidity - this was recommended to us and was our 1st visit to Singapore), food average, stupidly expensive. i do not mind paying up for excellent food, but this was not excellent. the good news: day before, we had the chili crab at Jumbo, which was 1/2 the price & can only say, since i did not have at Palm Beach, therefore can't compare, but Jumbo's chili crab was excellent! \u00a0so i didn't feel i lost out on finally having Singapore's signature dish. be forewarned, even \"IF\" all dishes had arrived together, i would still never return - just not worth being taken for a sucker when there are so many great places to eat in Singapore!! help this helps those who are thinking of going because of the name and location. oddly, i have not been able to find their menu online? their website does NOT have the menu, which strikes me odd. another reason not to go!",

    "text": "The reputation exceeds the actual experience at this famous restaurant. The service was very slow, often waiting 10m or more to get water refilled even though we were paying a fortune for bottled water. Food also took forever to arrive and not well paced (does anyone really want the vegetables before the main course arrives?) The food itself was okay, though personally I prefer more meaty flavorful San Francisco crabs or even the small Maryland crabs which at least are easy to hammer open. They do not provide the tools you need and are stingy with napkins and wipes. Overall the experience was well below what you would expect at a higher end place and of course there is no view from inside the restaurant (where there is minimal though insufficient A/C). If you want better crab (minus the view) I'd hit one of the outdoor food centre/hawker stalls. And beware the spicy chili oil will do a number on sensitive stomachs. I'll be generous with 2*",

Too much grease.Seafood fried rice is ok with lots variety inside.For sure will be back next time when trip to Merlion Park in the near future.",

The restaurant seemed to overbook itself and was unable to handle being at full capacity. Our servers, although very nice and friendly, were so busy they forgot about us completely.Food wise: Mango cocktail was nice, Asparagus scallop was good, Half crispy duck was great. Fried squid was not good at all. Three stars because the food wasn't overall bad. The experience: We were initially sat down at a dirty table. After it was cleaned, we sat there looking around for someone to help us, when were finally served water. The waiter who seemed like the outdoor seating Manager - again very nice but took our order and rushed away quickly. We got our food and didn't like the fried squid at all (very chewy and too sweet). However, no one attended to us at all and so we never had the chance to tell anyone it wasn't satisfactory. We then waited and waited and finally flagged down someone to get water re fills. Our table was never cleared and no one came by to ask us how we were doing at all. By the end of the dinner, we were so fed up that we just flagged down someone for the check and left. I was disappointed that we paid a lot of money for what we thought was a Michelin star level restaurant. I would not recommend this restaurant. However one plus was the gorgeous river and Marina Bay Sands view! And again staff was very nice but there needs to be some retraining on service and add more staff to handle the busy nights!",

The location is pretty sweet; it's near the Fullerton Bay Hotel and has a great view of Marina Bay Sands. If you go for dinner, I would definitely recommend sitting outside as MBS at night is such a beautiful backdrop. In terms of dress code, I'd say it's casual, but if you want to err on the side of caution, then a black smart casual outfit would do. (I mean, you'll be eating messy crab, after all!)Get your \"That's what she said\" line ready because let me tell you: the Sri Lankan crabs they serve are HUGE. We're talkin' 2 kg behemoths, with claws the size of a child's face. You'll definitely pay for it; the market rate was $80/kg the last time we went.Both the chili crab and pepper crab are delicious; I guess if I had to choose a favourite, I'd go with the pepper. But by all means, definitely try the chili so you can compare and write an educated Yelp review! For sides, I've had the kai lan and seafood fried rice; both good but not anything to Yelp about. I'd definitely save room for dessert though, as their fresh fruit platter is refreshing and the perfect palate cleanser. If you're dining with guests who don't live in Asia, it's even better; it's a great way to introduce delicious Asian fruits like jackfruit, durian, and mangosteen, produce that can be difficult to find outside Asia.After you're done, walk off some of that crab by strolling along Marina Bay and snapping some shots in front of the famous Merlion!",

    "text": "The Chili crab here was much tastier than jumbo. We had a seat inside near the live seafood tanks, and the crabs in there were some of the largest live crabs I've ever seen. We had chili crab, golden crab, prawns, fish wrapped in banana leaves...I can't even remember it was a seafood extravaganza. Unlike most places they actually gave us cloth napkins which was nice, in addition to the traditional finger bowls and wet naps. Recommended for seafood.",

    "text": "Great view of the bay, a classic Singapore sling and chili crabs. What more could you ask for?We came here with colleagues and had the whole gamut of foods including the whole friend grouper, chili crab and salt fish fried rice. At 20:00, the Marina Bay Sands puts in a great light show on the bay so come late and sit in the patio. The place was packed and the food was outstanding. On the downside, service was a little slow.",

    "text": "First off - just wanna comment on the restaurant's ODD name - haha - b/c its a straight up Chinese restaurant. Anyway - the food was alright and I am biased b/c I am vegetarian and although I appreciate the special veggie prix fix meal that they had available for 35$S - the food was super bleh. Now as for the seafood my friends devoured - they got the chili crab and the black pepper crab and a few other dishes and totally devoured everything. I am giving this place 4 stars not b/c of my experience but from watching how much the rest of my party enjoyed the place. Additionally - the location is just great - great view of the Singapore bay and a view of MBS",
