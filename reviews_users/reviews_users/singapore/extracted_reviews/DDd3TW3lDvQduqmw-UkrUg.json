    "text": "This is a tough one.. if I was rating just their baked pork bun, I'd give them a 5. However, if I'm to fairly rate them on all the food I tried, then it's more a 3. We naturally had the baked pork buns - they really are awesome. Had the prawn and spinach dumplings - the next best tasty option. The prawn wasabi dumplings - eerrr, just so so in my opinion. The egg white spring rolls - waste of calories! The beancurd skin - my friend liked it (I didn't). And the glunonous rice and beef with egg - no flavour and the beef and egg were texturally the same - gluggy. Overall, it was just an ok food experience (which is not what I'm looking for given the inflated prices). Apart from the pork buns, nothing stood out as being outstanding. I will probably give them another try the next time I'm in Singapore but will go for the fried carrot cake which appeared to be very popular, and of course their pork buns.",

Thankfully, I was not disappointed!!I've tried the Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong, so I definitely had high hopes for the one in Singapore. We went there on Saturday around 2pm, and the line wasn't that long. We only waited in line for about 30min before getting a table. The char siew bun and the pan fried turnip cake was definitely the best dishes. I like how the pork bun is served warm which made the pastry more flakey :)The har gao, siew mai, and other dim sum not in their famous heavenly 4 selection were so-so/ pretty average. Nonetheless, the pricing was pretty fair, so thumbs up for that!Oh, and I really enjoyed the dessert too :)Would definitely come back again, and wouldnt mind waiting 30 min again!",

    "text": "Tim Ho Wan, a household dim sum name in Hong Kong and now Singapore, has had me standing in line and then surrendering and eating at some other Chinese restaurants several times due to the impossible lines. Read my review on the Hong Kong Tim Ho Wan here.I finally sampled the Singapore version when we managed to score seats at the newly opened Bedok Mall during dinner time.We started with some Century Egg Congee with lean pork and salted egg ($4.20). I didn't try this in Hong Kong but hello salted egg! The flavor of the silky smooth and thick congee was certainly enhanced by the salted egg. Delicious!I've heard enough negative reviews on the baked bbq pork buns but i gotta try it for myself. First glance at the Baked Bun with BBQ Pork ($4.50) didn't leave a good impression already. It was pasty looking, nothing like that golden exterior of its hong kong sister. The bottom was oily and the bo lo crust wasn't milky nor crumbly enough. Kudos to that pillowy texture sandwiched between the meat and the upper crust, however, it wasn't good enough to cushion that shock i received from the char siew.Upon splitting the csblb into halves, my immediate reaction was WTF? How is that char siew?! Artificial coloring could be seen from a mile away and instead of juicy meat, i bit into chunky fats. I simply had to ask the waitress if this was really the csblb. Such a disappointment.The other standard Heavenly Kings include the Ma Lay Gao (Malay cake) a steamed cake with sugar. Honestly if you want steamed cake, you should just get it from any confectionery store. $3.80 per piece of cake is totally not worth the price. I gave the pan fried Carrot Cake and the Cheong Fun a miss this time since i wasn't overly impressed by them in Hong Kong.Decided to taste the Beancurd Skin Roll with Pork and Shrimp ($4). It was saucy and savory but kinda lacking in the filling department.The Har Gao or Prawn Dumplings ($5.50) were on the powdery. Instead of whole prawns, i believed they were filled with chopped up ones and it seems like fish/prawn paste were added to the mix. MEH.The other dish that hits the mark was the Tonic Medlar and Osmanthus Cake ($3.50). It had the same intense flavors as the Hong Kong one and left us refreshed with its lingering fragrance. Overall, edible dimsum, not super fantastic. I've had better dimsum in Singapore really. I wouldn't mind eating it is there isn't a queue but if i were to wait 1h for this, i would surely be darn pissed. p/s: Heard that the Toa Payoh outlet serves the best dimsum out of the lot. Let me know what you think!",

The roast pork buns are the best ones I've ever tried with a crispy, slightly sweet exterior and a mildly sweet cha seow pork filling. \u00a0This is a fabulous combination and I don't even LIKE roast pork buns most of the time. \u00a0The spinach dumplings are light, yet flavorful (I'm eating my veggies ma!) \u00a0The shumai as well as bean curd filled with shrimp and pork are satisfying and flavorful, but not filled with fat like it is at other restaurants. \u00a0I still found the roast pork buns to be tasty, but perhaps lacking a little crunchiness the last time I went, but still loved every bite.Dreaming of great dim sum?

Perhaps it's because it was way overhyped via media and all those ppl standing in line, but I've had similar or better at other local restaurants in both Singapore and Hong Kong, and not sure if this really \"stands out\" from the rest to earn its Michelin star.

    "text": "When I first heard of this restaurant, I instantly knew I wanted to go. \u00a0Not because it had 1 Michelin star or anything, but rather because I have a friend named Tim Ho and I wanted to tell him about it.Now that I've eaten there, I can say I would only go back for the same reason I went there the first time. \u00a0As in, I probably won't go back, since it wasn't worth the +2-hour wait, even though the restaurant was nice enough to provide tiny stools for us to sit on and shuffle along as we waited. \u00a0The restaurant is about as special as its menu: a small order form, with a (comparative to all the other dim sum restaurants I've ever dined at) \u00a0limited selection of dim sum dishes. \u00a0I was a tad disappointed, since there was really nothing special about this supposedly famous restaurant other than its famous baked BBQ pork buns.But don't get me wrong--the buns themselves are delicious. \u00a0Each order is $4.50 and contains three (small) fist sized buns. \u00a0I think what makes them distinctive is that they have this nice butter-sugar topping, kind of like the topping on roti and pineapple buns (if you're familiar with Asian bakery lingo). \u00a0The bread itself is delicate and well baked, and surprisingly isn't soggy from the gold mine of char-siew sauce-drenched BBQ pork stuffed inside. \u00a0I consumed my first two buns so eagerly that I didn't even realize I had scalded my tongue. \u00a0Rookie mistake. \u00a0As I looked around the rather small restaurant, I realized everyone else around me was eating a lot more slowly. \u00a0I proceeded to consume my last bun with dignity (read: table manners) and can gladly report it was just as delicious as the first two, even though I was now significantly more full.I don't know if it was the fact that I wasn't hungry anymore, but the rest of the dishes my two friends and I ordered tasted mediocre at best. \u00a0We ordered the steamed meat rice dumpling, which was filled with Chinese sausage, shiitake mushroom, and (who would have guessed?) BBQ pork. \u00a0The dumpling was good, but it had a slightly sweet aftertaste that I wasn't a huge fan of. \u00a0We also ordered shrimp dumplings, steamed pork ribs, beef balls, vermicelli rolls with (why am I not surprised?) BBQ pork inside, steamed vegetables (my roommate swears by vegetables, but I think it was a little expensive for the amount we received), and carrot cake, which were all dishes exactly you could order from any other ordinary dim sum restaurant.To sum up my experience, it was a lovely brunch, but I have dined at far better dim sum restaurants for the amount I ended up paying after we split our bill ($20). But at least I can say I've dined at Tim Ho Wan now!--although in my personal opinion, they should probably just rename the restaurant \"BBQ Pork.\"- - - PS: I actually ended up going back the next week with my co-worker, who had never tried the killer baked BBQ pork buns before. \u00a0With just the 1-hour wait (but mind you, we went on a random Tuesday after lunch) I thought it was much more worth it, and this time we both ended up spending $7.50 to share 2 servings of BBQ pork buns and 1 steamed meat rice dumpling.",

    "text": "One of the better Dim Sum places around Singapore, although it's not the best however it's pretty good and what makes it stand out is some of the more unique dishes that they offer. The menu isn't very huge and unlike some other Dim Sum places, your choices are limited however this might be a good thing cause those that your limited with are really good dishes such as their Four Heavenly Kings. Waiting in line is one hurdle you will need to get pass as during lunch hour or dinner hour lines could get a little crazy. However non peak hours are quite alright, so be patient because the food is definite worth it.",

The shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, spare ribs, and dumplings all get 2 or 3 stars for me. Also the wait time is very long, and with few seating spaces you definitely feel people ogling you and hoping you leave soon. But the baked BBQ pork buns were good enough to push it to four stars.",

    "text": "I was both surprised and thrilled to find out that this famous Michelin one-starred dim sum restaurant from Hong Kong had several locations in Singapore. \u00a0Since the itinerary of this dim sum lover didn't include HK on this trip, a visit to THW in SG was a must.This location is very conveniently located inside Plaza Singapura which is connected to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. \u00a0After a hearty meal of dim sum, you can go shopping and burn off some of the calories!While everything we ordered was super yummy as expected, I would like to highlight a few items that were unique to Singapore's menu, and were not available in Hong Kong.FRIED CHILI CRAB DUMPLING: \u00a0I was very impressed that THW included some regional flavors in its dim sum offerings. \u00a0In a country where chili crab is almost like the national food, the creation of the chili crab dumpling is most welcomed and appropriate. \u00a0It was just like the traditional deep-fried taro dumpling (woo kok) but the filling was a thick, rich, and yummy chili crab gravy that was sweet and slightly spicy. \u00a0THREE STARS STEAMED SIU MAI: \u00a0These are delicious pork dumplings and each was \"crowned\" with a \"star\" (see picture). The three stars were Chinese ham, black mushroom, and quail egg. \u00a0They all accompanied the dumpling perfectly well, and I personally liked the quail egg one the most (maybe that's because quail egg siu mai is so hard to find in the US).STEAMED PUMPKIN CAKE: \u00a0This dish was just like the traditional steamed turnip cake but was made with pumpkin instead. \u00a0The taste was just as good as the idea and was refreshing. The texture was soft but not mushy. \u00a0It was served with a slightly sweet soy sauce that added even more yumminess to its flavor.",

I also really liked the glutinous rice lotus leaf. Very moist and rice was very flavorful. I hardly ever eat rice too. The fried carrot cake and egg tarts were just okay. Pork dumpling was pretty good too.Pretty good service, I really can't complain. Staff is friendly and menu is also in English:-)",

At first sight from the menu it appeared to be overpriced, which we expected because of the Michelin star but of course you expect your food to be worth it. I had the pork buns and were delicious... totally worth it.Also had the noodles... were good, nothing amazing but they were fine.We ordered the chicken feet just to feel the experience of trying new things, I didn't like it at all but we had a lot of fun giving a turn to everybody in the table to taste the chicken feet and see the reactions. As a group we concluded that we didn't like it because we are not used to eat that kind of food and because of the consistency but at the end it doesn't taste bad.I'm a bucket list guy so being able to cross this restaurant out was worth it, we had fun with the chicken feet, my food was not good, and yes, it's overpriced; I would happily return with a 0 minute waiting queue (I'm really impatient). In conclusion, trying a Michelin-star-overpriced-but-affordable restaurant was a nice experience which I recommend.",

There was also a 10 minute wait when I happened to go for lunch with a few friends. Best. Day. Ever.I don't eat char siu bao normally. They just don't taste very good in my opinion. But I will eat an entire order of Tim Ho Wan char siu bao by myself. I think it's the bread. I don't normally like bao bread, but the breading here is soooooo good! Like many of the other customers, I will be back to Tim Ho Wan just for the char siu bao. The \"vermicelli\" noodles, or chong fun, is also very good, as are the shu mai and ha gao. You'll need to order other items other than the char siu bao because they limit the number of orders of bao to the number of guests dining at your table (boo!)You order your food using a little checklist that the servers provide you with. You write the number of orders for each menu item listed. You also have to order beverages (including water) this way. There is also no take out available unless you dine in and then take away \"left overs\" (oh, my bad, we *accidentally\" maxed out on char siu bao and couldn't finish.....). The service was pretty spot on until we got to the end of our meal and a different waitress came by to give us boxes. She stared us down like we were the most inconveniencing guests at the restaurant.....it was awkward. Overall, this the most I've ever paid for dim sum, but the food is just so darn good that I will definitely be back! Who wants to stand in line with me?!",

Thanks to a friend who had some free time and was willing to wait in line for the better part of the hour, we were brought to our table shortly after our arrival. We ordered almost everything on the menu, including the 4 heavenly kings. 1. bbq pork bun (#1 bestseller or hot favorite) - definitely to be eaten warm, that is in the restaurant. it was lackluster when I had it at home, several hours later. the top bits reminded me of bo luo bun. the bbq pork, while juicy, was also overly sweet.2. rice rolls (shrimps, pork liver, beef and char siew) - shrimp was the best (sweet and juicy), followed by char siew. Beef was so gooey soft that I could not tell if I was eating the rice rolls or beef slices. Not a fan of pork liver though my fellow diners liked it well enough. the rice roll itself was also moist and not hard and dry. one of the better versions around.3. glutinous rice dumpling in lotus leaf - this was my favorite. soft tender rice soaked with the rich flavor and taste of the chicken, sausage, mushroom and what not. 4. pan fried carrot cake - soft wobbly carrot cake which had a good ratio of water and flour. another favorite of mine. not too oily too. 5. shrimp dumplings - a nice size with a thin case around the sweet and plump shrimps.6. siew mai - also pretty good, not porky at all, with bits of prawns in it.7. rice with mushroom, chicken and sausage in a metal container - actually quite good, reminded me of the claypot chicken rice except it was not served charred in a claypot.8 and 9: some beancurd skin dishes which I did not know the names of. One was fried and one was braised. Both were good. 10. Ma Lai Gao (Malay cake) - soft cake with a strong taste of brown sugar. a bit too sweet for my liking. 11. some sort of vegetable dumpling - pretty ok, not so memorable.If I could only order 3 items, I would get the glutinous rice dumpling, pan fried carrot cake and shrimp rice roll. Then again, if I need to wait an hour to get a table, I will probably order everything and have the leftover packed in a doggy bag.",

Try the braised chicken feet, those \u00a0are from some really big chicken!!Lastly don't forget the Malay cake, those are steamed cake with brown sugar (I guess).",

    "text": "Tim Ho Wan is truly a special chain restaurant. I'm not going to belabor the point that this restaurant is great as so many of my fellow Yelpers have given their rave reviews. However, If I were to sum up all their reviews in a nut shell, it is the following: (i) long lines, (ii) amazingly crispy on the outside and (iii) mouthwatering taste / melt in your mouth type experience on the inside.Word to the wise, if you ever get a chance to eat at THW, FORGET ordering the usual Dim Sum staples: har gow, shiu mai, bean curd, etc. They are no better than those found at any Dim Sum restaurant, Crystal Jade, etc. I would solely stick to the THW specialities. The ones I consider specialties: Baked Bun with BBQ Pork (world famous), Yam Dumpling with Chili Dumpling (wouldn't be surprised if this was offered only in Singapore) and rice with chicken, sausage & mushroom. There may be others, but these are my favorite. Parting note: If you ever see a Tim Ho Wan without a line, literally drop whatever your doing and head over the restaurant immediately. You may never get this opportunity ever again. Enjoy!!!",

    "text": "Call me kapoh but when I saw a long line for Tim Ho Wan on a Tuesday night at 8pm, I knew there was something to be explored here. After all, who eats dim sum at NIGHT?! I peaked in at the bustling open-concept restaurant and saw a teeshirt they were selling that said \"World's Cheapest Michelin Restaurant\". Michelin?! Now I knew I had to try it... Having just had dinner, however, I tried to get some dim sum to go. But, nope! Can't do that. We later realised you can only get to-go after dining in (and you're limited to 3 plates per table or something like that)So the next morning, right at 10am (when they opened), we made our way back to Atrium mall to check out this dim sum restaurant.... The line had already formed and was a full line that went up to the first curve. F, I thought to myself. But thankfully, it moved super fast and we were in within 10-15mins. Now, what I experienced next was mind blowing. I Love good dim sum (yes, that's Love with a capital L), and this might have been one of the best dim sums I've ever tasted. So, I beg to differ from the other reviewers - I definitely thought it was worth the hype. After all, even if you didn't trust me, we both know Michelin doesn't just give out stars to anyone....Here's what we got and how they fared.Pork Buns: like everyone else said... truly heaven in your mouth. i don't even normally like pork buns at dim sum restaurants, to be honest. because of how bread-y and just blah the whole thing is. but this pork bun, this ones different. it came out piping hot, the pastry soft yet flakey/crumbly with the perfect amount of sweetness to it. it was generously filled with pork, and together with the bun, created an explosion of deliciousness in my mouth, so much so I wanted to scream a little. definite must try whether or not you like pork buns. Har Gow: generously filled with shrimps covered in a thin skin, it felt like the perfect ratio of dumpling skin to shrimps - which is always important. but more important than that, i loved how succulent and super fresh the shrimps were.Spinach, Garlic & Mushroom Dumplings: without a doubt the best veggie dim sum I've ever had. super generously filled with spinach, garlic and mushroom, the veggies aren't so finely chopped up whereby you feel you're just eating green mush, nope! with these dumplings, you can actually taste the texture of the spinach - and in my opinion, is what gives this veggie dumpling an extra oomph and clear edge over the rest of the veggie dumplings I've had. Shrimp Chee Chong Fun: good and well done. they pour the soya sauce on the cheong fun right when it gets to your table (as they should) so it doesn't get over soaked. Deep Fried Shrimp Beancurd Skin Rolls: I normally don't like the deep fried beancurd skin rolls because of how greasy it makes you feel after. however, though they were without a doubt oily, it didn't give me a yucky feeling after. and it was yummy enough whereby it was worth it, I'd say. Steamed Egg Cake: now, why don't they just call this steamed brown sugar sponge cake? because that's what it tastes like. don't get me wrong, I loved it. I really did. it was light, fluffy and not too sweet. I just wished I knew what it was from the name because it sure doesn't taste like egg! Chicken Feet: I can't say I'm a big fan of chicken feet but it was my mom who ordered it and she definitely enjoyed it, so.All in all, my top favorites were without a doubt the Pork Bun, Spinach dumplings and the Har Gow (the steamed egg cake follows close after too). I loved how fresh and full of ingredients and flavorful everything was. I loved that it wasn't too oily or salty and I didn't feel like all I ate was starch and msg after (like you do sometimes... okay mostly at dim sum restaurants in LA) yes, their menu is small (no Char Siew Pastry or Egg Custard Buns or any of that here) but you know what? They're incredibly good at what they have and I'm totally okay with that. Will definitely be back. In fact, probably in the next day or two...",

For the price that you are paying, I would seriously rather go to other dim sum places - the quality would be much better. Don't get me wrong, food wasn't bad. But just not up to what I have expected.... A tad disappointed. Hopefully they are still good in Hong Kong",
