    "text": "I got to try this ramen shop with my niece who is a big fan.The tonkotsu broth is viscous and almost overwhelms you with umami. The chashu were like slabs of pork roast properly caramelized and accented with little dabs of chili paste. The noodles. Hand made, firm, slightly coarse. The egg had tender whites and a semi molten yolk. The chicken karaage was crispy outside and most inside.In short it is more about fundamental execution than the additives. And this shop delivers in spades.",

    "text": "Oh Ramen Bari-Uma, I've lost track of the people I've recommended you to.I think the one minus to Bari-Uma is its inconsistency, but when they're on song, the charsiu here is amongst the best in Singapore, fatty, smoky, and delicious. They aburi it before serving so there's that extra smokiness for those who like it.Noodles and soup are solid complements to that rock-star charsiu, and the stock is rich, umami, and worth coming back for.I generally find the yakitori not worth mentioning, and to be honest, everything else on the menu is pretty mediocre. Just go for the ramen. Everything else is edible so if you really want to order gyoza or yakitori, go ahead. Just know that it won't be amazing.",

    "text": "I have since returned uncountable times to Bari Uma for my ramen fix. This is my go-to place period. They made a ramen fan out of me and it is hurting mee because no other place makes noodles that thin & soft or soup that rich, spicy and porky. I had Hida Takayama recently in Vancouver and even with all that collagen and made from scratch food I was like....bleh I miss Bari-Uma. Ditto with Ivan ramen and Ippudo in NYC, Tokyo...I know ramen is very subjective, so here are my reasons why this is a fiver:1) The char shu is so freakin' awesome. Charred, melt in your mouth with just enough fat to keep you eating that extra plate of char shu you knew you had to order. Plus they are super generous with portions.2) The noodles is made on the premises and it is always cooked the Japanese equivalent of \"al dente\". None of it is clumped together and I love that the noodles isn't too thick.3) The broth. Omg. Just taste it yourself. Get the spicy broth.4) Free tamago promo until 31 Dec '14 was awesome. You didn't need the flyer, just a smile.5) Service is pretty good even when the place gets crowded and the food is consistent. I don't mind paying $15-20 for ramen if it is consistently delicious.6) Free ice water. Yes, that's what the Singapore dining experience comes down to.7) Parking is easy. In and out in an hour isn't a problem.",

    "text": "Finally made my way to try the ramen at Ramen Bari-Uma last week. It is under the Kenko Fish Spa/Foot Reflexology at Tanglin Shopping Center, nearer to Orchard Parade Hotel. Unfortunately it is not linked to the main corridor of the building so you need to enter from the outside. Terrible when it is raining as there is no covered walkway from the main building. The menu is simple, similar to Marutama style or Uma Uma Ramen. It is pure ramen with a small selection of side dishes. The specialty is the thick cut char siu in pork broth. All the ramen except one is with pork broth. The exception is ramen in miso. I had the bestseller (I think) which includes a piece of the thick cut char siu, 1 whole egg (pretty big and they do not cut it in half), bamboo shoots and some chopped spring onions. The soup is very rich and thick and porky, great for those who love pork. The miso based soup is surprisingly saltier than the pork broth. The noodle is quite forgettable though. The good thing is they can do a smaller bowl for $2 less. Overall it is nice but not something I will want to travel all the way to have. I think there are many other options around which serve similar quality ramen.",

Asked to be seated on the side away from the 2x2s in the center aisle but instead get an incredibly rude comment from the waitress to her colleague that we (roughly translated) \"die also must sit there\". The head waiter came and explained that we were asking to sit where they normally seat 8 (the tables for 2 are joined together). Don't want this to sound like a long whine but in the end, \u00a0this is another restaurant with inflexible seating policies and a bad egg (no pun intended) waitress who (denied she said those words) should be in another line of work. We made our choice, \u00a0left to eat at Ippudo instead across the street and were much happier for it.",

We went into the PS Cafe (long line at 2 pm) and California Pizza Kitchen (the place smelled funny) nearby before settling here, and were grateful for this option.I had the ramen in spicy broth on two visits. It was a lot spicier on one visit than the other. They aren't stingy on meat like some other ramen joints in town -- I like the chunky pieces of meat. Broth is quite thick. and on the oily side. If you are on a diet, skip it ;)At 20 bucks (a bowl of ramen and a cup of green tea, no refill), it ain't cheap but it's similar to other ramen restaurants in town.",

    "text": "Yet another ramen joint has sprung up in Singapore - Ramen Bari-Uma, located at the basement of Tanglin Shopping Centre (NOT Tanglin Mall), replacing the Bombay Woodlands restaurant. Apparently it's a chain of ramen joints from Hiroshima.The Travelling Hungryboy gave this place a very good review, stating that it has fast propelled into his top 3 ramen places in Singapore, along with Menya Mushashi and Tonkotsu King. Well, since I loved the latter two, I had to try this place out for myself.I visited at circa 9.30pm on a Sunday night and boy was it empty - the only other diners were 4 Japanese. I ordered the Ajitama ramen (their specialty) to see what the fuss was about. My ramen soon came - and boy it was good! The broth was reminscent of Menya Musashi's - thick, savoury, full of umami, not too salty, and with a bit of that smoky flavour, although not as smoky as Menya's. Good, although I have to say I prefer Tonkotsu King's soup, which is a bit more complex. The pork on the other hand was better than Tonkotsu King's - it was charred nicely and had that char-grilled flavour. Overall a very good Ramen joint in Singapore - top 3 for tonkotsu. (8/10)",
