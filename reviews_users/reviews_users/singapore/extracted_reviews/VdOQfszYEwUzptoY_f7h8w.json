The chicken can be a little dry but the sauce just compliments it.Cheap prices at about $12 for a CBD lunch is worth it. Remember to ask for Chicken Thigh! Chicken breast is too hard.",

    "text": "I love a juicy chicken which is roast nicely, even better if the skin is crispy. Besides the chicken, I like the variety of sides you can choose here. You can select your 2 sides from either the hot section (cooked vegetables - corn, peas, cheese cauliflower or mash potatoes) or the cold section (all kinds of salad which rotates regularly). Quinoa or couscous salad will be my weakness here. I also like the spinach salad which is to come with beet and feta. Unfortunately I was there after 2pm and so it was mostly just spinach. The server was kind enough to check the kitchen if they still have more back there. There was but not much beet or feta was in that stash, so he tried to pick the beet for me. Kudos!The fish and chips was average. Chips were nice and the fish was ok I guess. It fell apart when I took a bite to try. I also like the hot sides as they are comfort food. I wish we can choose all 4 though. The cashier was also very kind to check what I wanted to have and suggested I take the salad as my side for the chicken and order the hot sides separately as that will cost less. The a la carte price for salad is around $9? I don't remember now, but definitely higher than the $4 a la carte price for hot sides. Fantastic customer service displayed. This is a good place for a bit of simple home style cooking of roast chicken with comfort side vegs and quinoa salad. Have I mentioned how much I love the quinoa salad here? It will be better to go earlier for lunch as you get to see the full spread.",

    "text": "Very busy over the lunch hour on weekdays, as this is a popular spot for CBD workers.The quiche ($8) was reheated and quite bad; very watery and lacked flavour. A paltry salad was added on the side but did not justify the price. Seating can be tough to find between 12-1, but after that it's nice to sit outside in the shade and read a book if you can find a table.Not sure I'll return to try the chicken, which seems to be their specialty, but I suppose that could be a saving grace.",

But that's not why I go there ;)They have a dish that makes me want to stop everything to rush and eat it. That's very simple, I cannot go here and do not order their BURGER.Massive, served with two kind of salads you can choose. They know what they do with this burger. Besides, it is not surprising that there is only one choice. They will always understand if you order The burger. It will come like an evidence to them. And it's only $12...The bread is good, soft and always served with perfectly cooked meat. Take your time to enjoy the sauce ...I need to go there, sorry!",

They are cheap, yummy, and somewhat healthier than the other options around here. $11.50 gets you a generous portion of quarter chicken and a choice of 2 side salads, or chips, or mashed potatoes and veggies. Their paninis are not bad too!They get super crowded during lunch, so it would be a good idea to come really early or really late.Even though I don't work in the area anymore, I still come back here for a meal every now and then!",

    "text": "Come here if you want fresh roasted chickens and good salads. When the Rotisserie first opened, they offered something like a quartered roasted chicken and two sides (great salads or mashed potatoes) for $9.50, which was a really good deal. It was such a good deal that the place got popular really, really fast and now you're almost not likely to get a seat if you're in the food queue later than 12.15pm. I like the roast chickens because they're minimally seasoned and roasted crisp with the juices retained in the meat. It's not hard to roast a chicken if you have a good oven, but I guess most people don't invest in good ovens or thermometer! The Rotisserie also serves ribs, fish & chips and other stuff but they aren't as noteworthy.The quarter chicken meal now costs $11 but beers are still cheap at $32 for a bucket of 5. The order system is quite fast - you line up at the cashier to order and pay, then proceed to the food counter to receive your meal with the order chit. It feels a little cafeteria-like but the restaurant makes up for it with speed. The decor here feels very modern Australian/Californian bare concrete floors and wicker chairs. I think the owners have struck gold with this simple concept and they're expanding to two more outlets in the area.",
