Had their signature truffle pizza, meatball rigatoni, roasted cod, several appetizers and dessert. All good but no wow factor - expected a bit more from a Jean Georges affiliated restaurant.Service is a bit slow but accommodating (i.e. one of my friends asked for a few customized dishes and they are happy to arrange)",

    "text": "Date night for two on a Saturday. Only scored an outdoor seating table at 9pm when reservation was made on Friday (poor planning on our part). But when we got there we asked if there were any indoor seating and we got one! We had:Burrata with Meyer lemon jam (fantastic combination, though the lemon did overwhelm burrata quite a bit. Burrata wasn't first rate, but the lemon helped cover its flaws)Fois gras /black olives /apple pur\u00e9e (super combination! Didn't think olives would work but it did)Fried calamari (just ok)Mains of:Meatball pasta (good depth)Baked cod (with coconut cream sauce. It was delicious)And dessert:Salted Caramel ice cream and popcorn (very very rich)Warm chocolate cake (good)Service was very good,And ambience was beautiful. With two cocktails, total bill was less than S$250 which isn't so bad. We were stuffedWill return!",

    "text": "Elegant modern d\u00e9cor. The food is good, but absolutely nothing to scream about. Service is friendly and polite, although it is a bit mechanical and lacks charm: our cold appetisers were served barely 5 minutes after the order was taken; precisely 5 minutes after we paid our bill, the waiter asked us to move to the bar to make room for the next service. At over $120++ per pax, it is not great value. Essentially, you pay \u00a0a hefty premium for the brand.",

They were prepared well but I cant say there was anything special. My dessert was a tart with meringue on top it was huge and too sweet for me - I had 1/4 of it. The staff was great!",
