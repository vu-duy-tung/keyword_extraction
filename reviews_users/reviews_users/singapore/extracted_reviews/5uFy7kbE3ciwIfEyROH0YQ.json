The amount of tables being turned over hour upon hour and the speed with which the team works bustling around to get the dishes out is bedazzling.Came here after a few work bevvies, and it's gyoza heaven. They are cooked as they would be in Japan, and the taste is sensational. The fried chicken (JFC) is also great, giving the Colonel a run for his money.Can defo recommend, but beware of lunchtimes when the queue monsters are out and about!",

Ordered small which was still a lot.Soup - veggie or miso. Ordered veggie soup - very nice. Love it!Egg with chives - like scrambled. Tastes good. Like this.Choice of Pork or Fish with tempura sauce or something else (can't remember). Ordered fish with tempura sauce - nice taste, can with a slice of brinjal and 2 small pieces of capsicumGyoza - choice of prawn or pork or something else. Ordered prawn gyoza - very oily, thick skin - not nice even with vinegar (colourless, which is not right; should be black vinegar).Didn't order any drink but they gave a cup of ice water.Only liked the soup so won't be coming back.Don't understand the 10-person queue outside the shop. Good thing I didn't have to queue as I was there early at about 12.10 p.m.",

I always get the prawn gyoza, which is a mixture of prawn and minced pork with a slight crustaceany aftertaste, and I absolutely loved it. Vegetable soup is so simple and comforting - Simmered veggies with pepper and a clean stock.Came again after months of not visiting - Hit the spot, and the quality and the standard of the food has not dropped. Five stars everytime.",

    "text": "My friend liked it so much she and her colleagues came 2 days in a row for lunch and I was lucky I decided to join them today.For about $16.40 (inclusive of tax and service), you get:1) a plate of on the spot fried gyoza - choice of pork or chicken and I forgot the last one. I tried the first 2 and while the chicken is tasty and quite good for chicken, the pork is better and juicier. The gyoza left quite a big oil stain on the plate, I wish they had served it with some paper on the side to blot. It had nice crisp top and edges.2) choice of 2 side dishes like fried eggplant with pork, omelet, some kinda tang hoon with ham, tofu with minced pork and a few others. I had the fried eggplant - smoky with wok hei and very savoury. The fried tofu was like agedashi style with minced pork on top and tasted like Chinese rice stall kind of sauce and style.3) rice with unlimited toppings. I picked small to start and that was enough4) help yourself to condiments on the table. I think there are usually 2 but there was only seasoned spiced beansprouts when I got there. My friend said she usually doesn't eat beansprouts but she loves these. 5) miso soup or vegetable soup, again unlimited topups. I had the miso and it was tasty with quite a good amount of kelp in it and bits of fried tofu.6) tea - my friend said it was barley tea but it tasted like brown rice tea. It was good and felt wholesome! You help yourself at the dispenser outside which also marks the queuing area.Yep, I love that for that price, you get a good amount of a varied balanced meal. Everything was served hot and freshly cooked. It is a bit greasy so not a daily meal but I would go back!",

    "text": "This is an awesome place. The amount of food you get for $14 is impressive, and the quality of everything is very high. I am not sure if they only did this because we arrived when they opened, but they cooked all of our sides fresh and they were all delicious: fried potatoes with pork gravy, pan-fried eggplant, and eggs with tomatoes and chives. The vegetable soup was very nice, and the rice was sticky and seemed high quality.One star is deducted because the gyoza itself was kind of surprisingly not the highlight (and we saw an ant on the table). The gyoza was good, but it could have been a little more flavorful somehow. It is odd that a place that markets itself as a gyoza place sets their prices such that it seems that they are trying to get everyone to order exactly five pieces of gyoza. If I had been able to choose, I would have wanted 10 pieces of gyoza and one side instead of 5 pieces of gyoza and 2 sides as their $14 set contains. Buying another 5 gyoza would cost $8, even though the gyoza is less than a fourth of the food included in the set.The staff were very nice and I will return.",

    "text": "An offshoot of the wildly successful Keisuke chain of ramen restaurants, and located barely a couple of doors down from the flagship Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King, the izakaya-styled Gyoza King puts the humble gyoza front and center on its menu.Here, you get a rice, a soup, and 2 side dishes, all centered upon your choice of gyozas. You round that off with unlimited helpings of their signature marinated beansprouts, something that I look forward to whenever I dine at the Keisuke Tonkotsu chain of restaurants.We had:1) Tonkotsu King Gyoza Set (top $13.90) - pork based: Fresh, juicy, and absolutely scrumptious. Best gyozas ever, even if this was laced with spring onions2) Keisuke King Gyoza Set (bottom $13.90) - shrimp based: I preferred the pork dumplings (but marginally so).3) Koshihikari Rice - Japanese steamed short-grained white rice sprinkled with furikake, which can be customised to small or big (or very big!) eaters.4) Get the Vegetable Soup, I much prefer the cabbage-sweetened broth over the basic Miso Soup.5) Out of the 8 options for side dishes, a must-try is the Tempura Fish, beautifully battered and dunked in a pool of delicate dashi and tempered with a dollop of grated daikon and ginger for a bit of heat.6) The Pork Sukiyaki followed closely for its homestyled flavours. We'd skipped the raw egg dip, such a maneuver harkens of a bulk-building Rocky Balboa. 7) If you're a fan of chicken popcorn, the Deep Fried Chicken with Spicy Sesame would likely be a side dish right up your alley. Crunchy, and spicy, this was perfect couch potato fodderPictures are at thehungrybunnie.blogspot\u2026",

    "text": "It's odd to be a fan of a place but not really crave to go back... yet that's how it is with Gyoza King! I definitely enjoyed my meal there, the gyoza were excellent (I hear the chicken ones are the least awesome of the options) and the value was pretty decent too. Actually, better than decent. If you take the 'larger' portions of rice, it's A LOT of food. The queue though was tough, and as good as the food was, it's hard to say it was worth the wait. I'm not sure if the queues are still as long as they were when I first went but if there aren't queues then that's definitely a big reason why I'd go back. The side dishes (i.e. everything not a dumpling) were pretty mediocre. Nothing stuck in my mind, but wow. Those dumplings. I'm craving one right now.One last important tip: CASH ONLY!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try out this place, due to rave reviews on yelp and also a personal recommendation from a friend. I liked the simplicity of the menu, it was easy to order, and has a good repertoire of side dishes to choose from. The side dishes were actually pretty decent, as well as the rice served. The reason for the two stars is due to the overwhelmingly disappointing gyoza. I mean, with a name like gyoza king, I expect the gyoza to be good. Maybe not great, but at least good. Instead, I got a plate of gyoza of which was overboiled before frying. I know this because instead of getting an explosion of rich sweet meat juice when I bit into it, I got an explosion of water, which reminds me of when I overboiled my frozen gyoza back when I was in college. The fillings are not at all flavorful, and kinda bland. I didn't understand the crowd lining outside at all! I think people generally come for the side dishes, but I do not think that I will be back again, the gyoza was just simply too disappointing.",
