    "text": "I love hor fun (flat rice noodles) and I believe I have found my favorite place in Singapore. Most other places just seems like the noodles were blanched in water, drained and brown gravy poured over it. Some might prefer it that way, but I prefer the noodles tossed in a super hot wok so it can absorb all that \"wok essence\" which I can definitely taste in the noodles here. Tried both the wet and dry versions of beef hor fun and both equally delicious. I saw a TV food program and this place was presented on an episode about hor fun. I mentioned it to the waitress and she quickly started waving her hands (assuming I meant I saw her) and said, 'oh no, that wasn't me, that was the owner' ... so humble.Also tried their coffee pork ribs and sambal kang kong - all very tasty. Will visit again for sure.",

    "text": "This was my first meal in Singapore, We had just finished getting checked into our hotel and needed something to eat. I opened my yelp app and found that Lor 9 Beef Kway Teow was just a short walk away.The restaurant is situated on a corner, there is indoor and outdoor seating, we decided to eat outside, we took a seat and menus were brought to us. We ordered drinks first and then looked over the menus, despite the name of the restaurant there is more that just beef offered here.I decided on the Black Pepper Beef, my friend decided on the Deep Fried Baby Squid, we also ordered some Yangzhou Rice to share.One thing that was a little different here and something that I will soon find out if it is the norm here in Singapore is that when the drinks were brought out we had to pay for them right then, it was the same when the food arrived, the plates were placed on the table and you pay right then and there.Well anyway I took a couple scoops of rice and started in on the Black Pepper Beef. I have of course had this dish before but here the sauce was thick, rich, and slightly spicy, the rice was good but my main dish was outstanding. The beef was tender, the vegetables were fresh, and the sauce was perfection.My friend enjoyed her meal but not as much as I enjoyed mine, she thought the squid was too dry. She is from Thailand and I'm sure that she is used to her food being cooked a certain way. I have no way of judging what she ate so I'll chalk it up her indifference to different cultural influences, cooking styles, and local ingredients.",

    "text": "Amazing. If there's a dish that I will miss dearly whenever I leave Singapore, this will be the one. We do have beef hor fun back in Penang or in KL, but this one is a class above the rest that i'll give it to Singapore. I came here a couple of times before and business has been consistently good. Food wise - good as well. Do come early or slightly late after dinner if you want a table fast. Or else, you have to queue for it. Some of the highlight include the famous beef kuey teow (filled with wok hei and amazingly tender beef), \"heh coh\" aka fried prawn patties (?), stir fried tou miao, salt and pepper fried chicken wings and seafood mee goreng. I would recommend to come in a group so you can order a few dishes and share among yourself. One caution though, the fish dishes here tend to get a little too expensive. During my first trip here, we ordered a whole pomfret cooked 2 ways (sweet and sour one side, and another deep fried fillet) and it cost us SGD$65. So do not fall into that trap unless you really crave for fish and dont mind paying that ridiculous price. It can be a love-hate relationship with the service here. While the waitresses (mostly from China and a few locals) can be rude to some, to me, they're just being very efficient and want to get things done because things can get chaotic during peak hours at the restaurant with people coming in non stop and asking them 1001 questions. What I usually do is upon seated, ill ask for a menu and ill tell the ladies to come back later after 10 mins or 15 mins. Quickly look through the menu and make up my mind and order. The waitress will tell you \"due to lack of manpower please order your drinks at the counter\". Trust me, they always take this as a reason! One tip: if you fancy a plate of oyster omelette, you can actually walk across to the other side of Lor 9 and order from another shop located just adjacent from the beef hor fun place. Oyster omelette was meh. Nothing special and too oily. In total we paid $65 (large beef hor fun, vege, mee goreng, chicken wings and fried prawn patties) - very reasonable. Another $10 for the oyster omelette from the shop across the road.",

Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes and although we've never had to wait to be seated here, the food's always been good.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality.Beef Hor Fun or Beef Kway Teow is a wok fried beef dish with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the \"Wok Hei\" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.The flavours balanced extremely well and the Wok Hei was far more prominent than most hawkers and the chef has it down to a fine art as it was beautifully crafted on every occasion that we've been here.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Beef Hor Fun and by far the best in our travels. We also had the clams, the sweet and sour pork, the fried baby squid or Sotong Goreng, ginger frog legs and you can also get vendors from across the road to serve you up meals too and had Oluak aka Oyster Omelette from across the road too.Cheers!Dave.",

Ladies should refrain from dressing too revealing as this place is located in the infamous red light district.Driving and parking is always a headache in Geylang, where it seems no one is afraid of getting run down by a car. Every road and lane in Geylang is a one-way street so plan your route well to avoid driving around in circles. The top dish to order is obviously the Beef hor fun. You can order it with bee hoon or rice as well. The beef gravy is to die for, however, be warned that the beef tastes like its been soaked in a lot of tenderizer.The standard of the beef horfun is fairly inconsistent, where the horfun is pre-cooked and the gravy is poured onto it when the store is busy.",
