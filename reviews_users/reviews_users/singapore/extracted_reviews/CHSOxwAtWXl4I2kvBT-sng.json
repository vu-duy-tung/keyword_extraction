At dinner, the food is more sophisticated, but prices are quite extravagant, overall resulting in poor value. I find that if you want an upscale Indian meal, Rang Mahal is way, way better (more refined and innovative cooking, not just gimmicky; and more pro-active service). Alternatively, Song of India and Punjab Grill also serve better food. Otherwise, if you just want an old-fashioned but very satisfying North Indian meal, then there are many choices in Singapore at a fraction of the price of dinner here: the Curry Culture, Tandoor at Holiday Inn Orchard, or even Kebabs and Curries at Mustafa Centre!!",

I generally don't prefer buffets but we were hungry on our way back from Singapore Zoo and we wanted Indian food. We tried everything from pani-Puri, sev-puri, pav bhaji, main course Indian subzis, daal, naan (in short we hogged). The taste somehow reminded me of being back home in India. Flavorful and delicious. I would highly recommend the pav bhaji (especially people traveling from the west to East (India)Service: 5/5As it was a buffet we didn't look for great service. But their general service was on point. Neither too intrusive nor too relaxed. The live counters were quick and efficient in serving food.Ambience: 5/5Ambience is a big part of my dining experience. This place was one to make the best restaurants in San Francisco make a run for their money. Spacious, neat and decor that would want to make you relax and enjoy your meal.All in all a great dining experience and would go/recommend Yantra anytime I am in Singapore.",

    "text": "Yantra is an very high priced Indian restaurant that I would not recommend unless you are looking for a new spot to try out. What makes this review odd to me is that I had two completely different dining experiences in the same dinner...I started out with a very high enjoyment of the restaurant followed by what I thought was totally abysmal.I was joining my friend for a dinner and knew she would be late so went ahead and started myself. The setting is beautiful in what is a pretty ugly and boring Tanglin Mall. I came in without reservation on a Tuesday evening around 6:45 PM and was seated by the friendly hostess at a nice corner table. My waiter was named Raju who was a total rockstar, very cool, prompt and attentive throughout.I was starving and went ahead and ordered the following: 1) Chair Chaat ($16) - Uniquely presented Indian street food snack placed on wooden chairs. Delicious and fun! Great way to start.2) Paneer lal merch ($29) - If you like paneer tikka (Indian fluffy cheese cooked in the tandoor oven) this is a solid choice. You can taste the unique flavors of the tandoor and they also top it with a light masala sauce of some sort. 3) Chicken Tikka Makhani ($40) - Yes, that's a $40 dish. I was craving my usual butter chicken so I got it. White meat chicken tikka in a tomato paste curry. It was great and hit the spot but as other Yelpers have pointed out, it doesn't have anything particularly special compared to some other marquee Indian restaurants in Singapore. But if you are craving this dish as much as I do, it was good.4) Plain naan - Good and did its job.5) Raita - Yogurt with veggies and herbs that I use to put on rice to combat any heavy spice from curries. The raita is very well made here!For a starting drink, I was curious about the Watermelon and Rose Martini which was made with chunks of watermelon, Belvedere vodka and rose water. A bit strange that they don't strain the ice but I figure because they want you to enjoy the fresh watermelon chunks?Service and food up to this point was incredible and I was ready to give it 5 stars on Yelp. I would highly recommend you order the above at the very least if you are looking for a good meal. However, that's about when my friend joined in and everything turned bad.The restaurant seated a few more tables and Raju began serving the others while we were with one of the other waiters who wasn't as attentive.She ordered the following:1) Tandoori Avocado ($32) - cool concept except it was awful. The masala spices tasted nice but it completely contrasts the rich texture of the avocado which just tasted bad. We both felt ripped off on this.2) Ganderi Kabob ($28) - Looks better than it tastes. I had an identical plate on my recent trip to Vietnam which was a fraction of the price with 500 times better flavor and texture.3) Sugarcane sorbet ($12) - The absolute WORST sorbet I've ever had in my life. Seriously, who puts masala powder on top of a sorbet? It also tasted more like a faint ginger than anything else. Understandably, sugarcane doesn't have much of a flavor but why do they even have this on the menu? It has a cool dry ice presentation but otherwise...Horrible.4) Cheena Payesh ($20) - Think of Ras Malai indian dessert except they ruin it by including diced strawberries and cheapen it by serving it in a cheap looking martini glass.Lastly, they have a bit of an odd cocktail menu since 90% of their drinks have Indian spices in them which is strange. My friend had the Indian Mojito which she liked - refreshing masala cocktail. I ordered the Mango Gimlet thinking they use fresh mango puree but rather they use something that is green and disgusting.I want to commend Indian restaurants that try and push the boundaries for what is usually a typical and predictable kind of experience but to say that some dishes were just awful is a totally new thing for me. I love Hemant Oberoi restaurants in India but this one is not one I would at all recommend for a nice Indian food night out. It's a great setting but I can't stand feeling ripped off, and I've only felt this way at a few restaurants around the world.",

Not a place to eat at every day, but if you have visitors and want to show them some great Indian food, then try Yantra.I can only comment on the weekend buffet, which is pricier, but has different free flow options. The choice of food is really very good. The main trick is not to overdo the appetizers and leave room for the entrees. One tip is to bypass the rice. Amongst the appetizers, for me the tandoori mushroom stand out for flavor. Entrees include many lamb, chicken and vegetarian dishes each cooked with the same consistent care and attention as the others. The staff will also bring you some appetizers made in front of everyone by one of the chef's. Very tasty. Pricy yes, but a great place to eat good Indian food if you have the stomach and the wallet.",

    "text": "Tucked away at the end of Tanglin Mall (street level coming in from Starbucks or Traders Hotel side, not Taxi Stand level) is Yantra. It looks posh and quiet. Either most people overlook this place or think it is too expensive. They are not wrong. The location is not the greatest as it is not easily visible from both the inside and outside. The a la carte dishes are very pricey. Mains and entrees start from $20 to $50 or more. Fortunately they do a lunch buffet on weekdays and weekends which make it very affordable to try and dine. I went on a Thursday and the lunch buffet was $19++ which is value for money. The quality of the Indian food is excellent and the ambience and decor are classy, understated elegance, making it almost a fine dining destination. The dishes available when I was there (what I can remember):It serves 3 kinds of rice - briyani (chicken and vegetarian) and plain white rice. There are 2 tandoori dishes (prawns and chicken - pretty tender and moist, much better than most places which are often dry and hard).There is a decent variety of relishes and chutneys, including regular raita and tomato/vegetable raita). The curries and vegetables (okras, paneer, broccoli cheese...) are equally tasty. Plain naans are brought to your table. Dessert - carrot pudding, rice pudding, gulab jamun and fresh fruits. As Indian desserts go, they are generally very sweet and these are no exception. That said, I am pretty much blown away as a tiny bit goes a long way and the sweetness becomes just nice. The gulab jamun is kept warm in a pot and it is soft and light and moist. Service is also excellent. The water glass was topped up constantly without having to be asked. I would definitely want to go back again, but likely for the lunch as dinner will be too expensive since most people will order several dishes to share.",

There were 3 veg salads (Greek Salad, Mixed Salad and pickled type salad) and 2 snacks options (corn kabab and gobi pakoda). The Greek salad was finshed at 1pm (lunch time 12-3pm) and was empty till 2:30pm with excuses that they are making it and it is coming. In the main course, we had pulao rice, Raita (which was empty bowl all the time even after asking for 4-5 times) Yellow dal, Baigan gravy dish, Mix veg dry and paneer makhani. The only good main course was the yellow dal. Rest of the food was not good.We asked the waiter for Bread/Naan to be extra crispy and he made a sarcastic comment and argued with us which was very unpleasant and spoilt our lunch date. He realized it later and apologized to us. With this experience at yantra, I feel I should not give more than 2 or 2.5 rating for such a high class restaurant and it is not at all worth the $58 for 2 for vegetarians. The highlights were salads which were very good and Breads/Naans which were very crispy to our taste.",
