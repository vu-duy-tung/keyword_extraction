But again, I came here for the pretty ambience and I loved it for that.",

It was 10pm. \u00a0We ordered a small green salad - $15 (and it was small), a small garlic prawns - 5 small prawns served on 6 very thin half slices of oranges on a 6\" diameter plate - $30 (no rice or accompaniment), & a pinnapple rice dish - $25 (we thought the menu charge was $12 until the bill came and the waitress pointed out we were looking at the wrong price line - very misleading). The bill came to $80! Granted, this is a highly trafficked tourist area - but I would recommend any other restaurant on the river before this.",

She offered to comp us a cocktail, which was nice bc alcohol is pricy in Singapore! The Singapore sling was 18 bucks a drink! Thinking it's a good deal, we ordered the pepper crab, Indonesian fried rice, and a large side of veggies. We knew it was a bad sign when our drinks came and we could not taste any alcohol in it. I usually get the Asian glow at the first sip and this drink was just like juice. The crab was not bad, it was actually good, but we really felt ripped off and scammed by the prices. Our meal was $150. Really? We did not leave full and the veggie side/rice were not better than a hawker stand that would have charged $5. They also charged us a dollar for the wet nap the put on the table. Who charges for a wet nap? Tacky and slimy. Sorry we wasted a dinner there; only white people were there and no locals- that should have been a good hint",
