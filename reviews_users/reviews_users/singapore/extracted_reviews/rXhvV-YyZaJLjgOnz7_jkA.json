The indoor seating area was adorned with white furnitures, clean lines, the omnipresent blackboard menu and was lit with a stylish chandelier.M had the Aglio Olio. It was enjoyed muchly and quickly, notably having the kick needed for the dish but isn't painfully spicy. This will be perfect for people who prefer to do without the numbing heat from chilli padis is most Aglio Olios. The Aglio Olio at Fika is served plain and additional ingredients that goes into it will be charged.I had Swedish Meatballs which came with cream sauce, lingonberry sauce and sides of half a potato and salad. The meatballs were more floury than those at IKEA, which I felt gave them a more homemade feel.We also had the Lingonberry cheesecake ($7.50). Go for this if you're on for rich decadent cheesecake. I felt this had an interesting slightly powdery aftertaste, which I'm not too sure what to make of but I enjoyed it enough.I returned on a separate occasion for their crepes which are delish too!",

    "text": "Totally love the smoked salmon open-faced sandwich! Fika is a place i frequent visit for their varieties of desserts. It's a great place to catch up with friends over a cup of hot tea and a slice of cake. Their service is warm & friendly, The meatballs are good but i would go for their other dishes such as the Aglio Olio that you can choose from chicken, meatballs, shrimp or smoked salmon. They serve really good savoury crepes too. The crepes are light and fluffy. For those who love to hunt for a good breakfast spot, you want to try it here. My choice will be their Raggmunk. It's rally good and sure fill up the stomach! It's a traditional Swedish breakfast set comprises of potato pancakes, shredded carrots, turkey bacon and the lingonberry jam. The set comes with your choice of drinks, either the Swedish blueberry or rose hip drink.For parents who wants to enjoy these Swedish delicacies, fret not, Fika offers kids meal too!For those coming in groups, do inform them in advance like what I did and we were all seated at the comfy second floor.It's definitely a place worth going and great for those who are on their first date. ;)",

Its usually quite crowded so reservations are recommended!Personally, I'm not so much of a meatball fanatic but the ones at Fika are actually really enjoyable. Quite unlike a certain other Swedish meatball eatery. They've a nice crust to it that retains the juice from the meat. Do give their Pannbiff a try as well. Its the same meatball mixture but made into a larger beef patty.I also had the lobster and seafood pasta which i thoroughly enjoyed. The sauce was excellent, the seafood was fresh and the pasta cooked perfectly.",

Yes, as you might have guessed it, it's a \"Swedish\" cafe, right in the Kampong Glam area in Singapore.How Swedish can it be? Well the decor inside is very Ikea-ish and they do have a lot of Swedish dishes like meatballs (halal, obviously), pytt i panna and many other dishes that were on the menu. Since we weren't feeling like eating Swedish dishes in Singapore (hello, laksa!), we came here just to get refreshments and shade from the harsh Singaporean sun.Boyfriend ordered (Swedish) coffee while I got myself a lingonberry-ade that was surprisingly fresh and nice (a little bit sour). We shared an earl gray cake, although there was prinsesst\u00e5rta in the cake shelf. \u00a0Overall, it's a nice ambiance, maybe for Singaporeans who want to try out Swedish stuff, or for the Swedes who miss food from home, but as for me, it's just another concept cafe that is currently trending in Southeast Asia",

The day before Thanksgiving, my fried took me to Arab Street and the area was the definition of peregrine. It's very exotic and I wish I had a magic carpet and smoking hookah with Nigel Gallagher.Though we passed alley ways with names like Baghdad and Haji Lane, and mosque so grand with glistening lights resembling twilight, my friend opted to take me to a Swedish restaurant.What?Yes, we went to a very cute Swedish cafe at Arab street. No hookah smoking. No lamb kebabs or Briyani Rice. We were eating Kottbular instead! Hahaha. The meatballs were very good, Allahu' Akbar. Thank you for at least a decent meal and it's very reminiscent of what I had when I was in Scandinavia. \u00a0I've never been to Sweden but they eat this in Norway where I was and everything was proper as I remembered. The boiled potatoes were the indication for me. That was all I ate when I was in Norway as they served it with every meal. The service was great for Asia. I truly hate Asian customer service as there is usually none. However, it was very nice here and the owner talked to you and made small conversation. There were a lot of couples dining there as well. The inside was very chic and cute. My friend and I had a great time catching up after almost twenty years not seeing each other. It was a good time.So, a romp in Arab street eating Swedish meatballs. Can't get more exotic than that!",

I didn't get the impression that we were eating authentic Swedish food, it was just another general Western food cafe to me. I was there on a quiet day and my friends and I were quickly ushered to a table. I had the Swedish Pasta Bake (Fusilli pasta, tomatoes, cream sauce and minced beef, topped with melted cheddar cheese). It tasted okay, but I couldn't find anything fantastic about it. And for the price, they could definitely could have afforded to add more beef! I tried some of my friend's Swedish meatballs. They were so tough and tiny! The cheesecakes were not bad, but were so expensive at $7.90 to 8.50 a slice. Prices for other items were just as sky high. A not so memorable experience. The uniqueness lies in the fact that it's the only halal Swedish food establishment in the island.",

These meatballs are huge and of course made with real meat mash. The texture leans to the powdery and starchy side. I thought it's more like a meat loaf. What's great about this is that the restaurant is certified halal. This definitely tastes better than those halal meatballs at Ikea. If you have Muslim friends and are sick of dining at the usual Halal restaurants, I'd say this is a good option. Fika is located in the cultural rich Beach road. Head on over to Haji Lane for some shopping after. :)",

Ordered up, and due to the crowd, the chow took a while to arrive, which is understandable. At least we weren't of the party that could only hang around and look about forlornly. Had a Toast Skagen, which is essentially a smoked salmon and prawn open sandwich, and Tunnbr\u00f6dsrulle - a generously portioned bread roll containing sausage, mashed potato and shallots. I quite liked the Toast, though my friend found it a little on the fishy side. He rather enjoyed his sausage dish, while I thought it was very Asian inspired with the addition of shallots and chili sauce. To cap dinner off, we had a serve of Swedish pancakes to share. I completely did not like this, as it's the rubbery textured sort that I'm not fond of. My friend polished it off though, but he also mentioned that the ice cream was not of good quality, which I agree. Service is prompt and crowds are affably managed. Not bad at all.",

    "text": "The first time it opened, Fika was quite the exotic swedish food joint in arab st and I'd go there for special occasions with friends. But the pricey food and the unchanging menu has kind of made it lost its appeal. You basically come here when you're with a group who are craving for halal meatball (stuff of which you can actually make at home, it doesnt require an extensively skillful technique)What I like about this place is ambience and service. The floor upstairs feels like a pop-up restaurant decorated with everything from ikea. It even has a fake fireplace to make it cozier. I once had to wait a long while for my order because they served me the wrong dish. But what was nice about it was that I was given a bowl of soup on the house (to quell my hunger and also to join in my other friends who have started eating). I thought that was a nice gesture. The soup was also delicious! (or maybe its coz I was really hungry). I've tried the baked rice dish - it's better for sharing because the portion is big and it gets too filling after awhile.Final verdict: The meatball dish is the constant favourite, until I learn to make better meatballs in my own kitchen!",

    "text": "The Skagen Crepe $16.50 is a cold crepe that is filled with smoked salmon, shrimp and fish roe. More fillings might be good to hold up what seemed like a deflated roll. It did not have a notable taste and the mayonaise was slightly diluted.This Beef Pannbiff $18.90 consists of two huge beef patties, saut\u00e9ed onions. They were less greasy than Blu Kouzina's version but the substantial amount of meat became overwhelming. Best recommended for sharing. Taste is rather similar to the meatballs so it's perhaps better to order either one instead of both.The Chokladballs, or Swedish Chocolate Balls ($5.50 for 3) are refrigerator cakes aka no-baked cakes. Made of oatmeal, sugar, coffee, cocoa, butter then rolled in coconut flakes, this has a grainy, rustic texture similar to a compact wholemeal ball.......",
