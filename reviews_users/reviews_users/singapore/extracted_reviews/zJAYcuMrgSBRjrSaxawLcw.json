    "text": "I've taken a lot of my friends here and am extremely fond of this place. For 8.50 SGD a plate for the Chicken Biryani & 9 SGD a plate for the Mutton Biryani, is a steal for the generous quantity that is served!Most importantly, the Biryani that is served here is of truly excellent quality albeit the taste can be a tad bit inconsistent at times. Sometimes the rice feels powdery & a bit dry but that was probably because of the weather. The key to a great Biryani is that the meat & rice needs to be slow cooked in traditional spices for it to be at it's juiciest best. That is exactly how the owner approaches this complicated & subtle dish.This is as authentic as it gets & it's NOT that brown goop they serve with yellow rice at most places which even the owner at Bismillah agrees is an abomination! Biryani was the dish of Mughal emperors & soldiers & signified feasting in a royal manner. It was considered a complete meal in itself & it is with that respect for tradition & flavour that the owner/chef Arif bhai cooks it. It is his love for crafting this complex dish that adds to the old school charm of this place in addition to the brilliant food. Try chatting up with the owner if you visit the next time, he's a wonderful gent with a well informed viewpoint on food & life...& throbbing passion for what he does.",

What was troubling was the price, $15 for a plate of mutton biryani, was surely very expensive, and the mutton was not as good as the chicken. The little pot of yoghurt they give, is just abysmal and watery. The guys serving and taking orders have oodles of attitude which makes the place quite unfriendly to go to. I didn't find the Biryani, attitude and portions worth going again. I am still on the hunt for the best briyani.",

In fact it looks slightly run down and you might have questions about the hygiene levels of this place. However no doubt, this biryani, both chicken and lamb are pretty solid. There's a trick to this though. You need to go at a certain time, which changes on a daily basis and can be luck oriented....it's when you get the scoop of the biryani that takes in the most amount of the masala that you enjoy this biryani in it's peak form. I recommend 330 - 4 pm for an afternoon biryani",

Found this place on yelp and wanted to try it...Went all the way looking for it and must say when i saw it from the outside I was very skeptical.. This is what one says that dont judge a book by its cover..The biryani was amazing!! Hands down the best i have had in Singapore. Given the fact that I was not sure till i tasted it.. made the experience even better.. The rice was full of flavor and the mutton was so flavorful. I has few bones to suck on and that was amazing.. I read one reviewer mentioning that if you get from the bottom of the pan then you are lucky, and I guess i did get that as the flavor was \u00a0so good.. \u00a0 Can wait to get to Singapore again !!!",

The chicken can be very hit or miss, and mine came out quite dry while some of the others had chicken that was more moist. Sometimes the biryani will come in a neatly packed dome shape, and other times it'll come a bit disheveled and shoved in front of your face. All up to your luck and their mood I guess.Don't expect much in the way of service here. It's pretty low-maintenance. You have to call over the waitstaff pretty insistently for anyone to come and help or serve you. Kulfi is a really interesting indian ice cream that's not too commonly found in Singapore. It's simply ice cream with some spices/pistachios in a little plastic cup. You have to rub it in between your palms to get the popsicle out. The ice cream also has various spices and pistachios sprinkled in it. Quite simple, but also quite comforting and refreshing; a great way to end the meal.",

This type of biryani is completely different. No need for the sauce, all the flavor has been soaked into the perfectly cooked rice. The server wasn't there to please, but when the meal came so quickly, I didn't mind at all especially after my expectations for the meal were exceeded. I'd probably give a 4/5, but I think some people harshly give 2 or 3 stars for arbitrary reasons that have to do with things other than the quality of the food, like their ego. 5/5.",

The only complaint is that it had whole cloves in the rice, which added to the flavor but we're difficult to avoid when chowing down (however I will chock this up to my American tendencies). We also ordered the mutton kebab which was juicy and delicious - totally melt in your mouth. Pretty spicy, but cooled down really nicely with the green sauce provided.",

Don't expect any customer service cause you ain't gonna get any. Moreover they make you feel like they are doing you a favor. Food quality : 5/10Customer Service: 1/10Overpriced: hell yes",

    "text": "Over-rated. And very bad attitude of the owner. He was upset that he got mentioned in the Michelin guide as now he will have to serve more customers. It was shocking to hear that from a business owner. Their Biriyani and shaami kebabs are at best, ordinary. Don't know how they got mentioned in the Michelin guide. Similar sentiments have been expressed by my colleague. In fact, try the Biriyani at Sankranti on syed alwi road. It's much better.",

We had Chicken Dum Biriyani and Mutton Dum biriyani. Both were very delicious and fulfilling bit spicy but that's ok :). As it was a weekday evening there wasn't much crowd and hence the staffs were quite accommodating and friendly.",

    "text": "The place doesn't look so hot - the shophouse is a bit rundown. But the dum briyani is the bomb. The rice is fluffy, aromatic from the spices and entirely greaseless because the owner cooks with safflower oil rather than ghee. Happy me cos then I can down the whole plate without feeling like I swallowed a rock but carbo-phobic eaters might wanna avoid this place cos like all briyani places they're generous with the rice. The chicken is tender and fall off the bone.But what the aficionados go for is the mutton and kid goat briyani. The latter is only available on certain days but the portion of meat is super generous for $15. I'm scared of gamey meat, but my foodie friends swear by the mutton and kid goat, so next time I shall drag them along and pinch some off of them to try.The lassi is fabulous - rich and creamy, and not sweetened to tooth aching levels. I'd advise going early cos when we went at noon place was full and a queue was already forming. And the owner said forget it during fasting month cos the queue starts at 5.30am which is when he starts cooking the briyani!",
