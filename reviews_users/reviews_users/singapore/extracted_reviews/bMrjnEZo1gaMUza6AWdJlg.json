    "text": "I was looking for Yelp Help for our last dinner on a recent trip to Singapore and found this. We were a party of 10 adults and 2 toddlers, back from a full day at the zoo and quite hungry. The first timers in the group had a bit of time to walk down a stretch of Orchard Rd, then I wanted a nice resto for after.We ordered: scallop and crab meat fried rice (our group's absolute favorite!), crispy roast chicken (sooo good), sauteed broccoli with scallops (excellent dish and beautiful presentation, with pretty shells on the plate). Those were the standouts, but really everything we had was good, including the roast pork, three kinds of vegetables in oyster sauce, and the last two orders of xiao long bao from dimsum lunch. Lemon iced tea was yummy here too!Service was helpful, kind, and efficient. This was the cherry on top of a really good dinner. I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Best restaurant we had while we were in Singapore. \u00a0Traditional Cantonese cuisine at Orchard road. \u00a0The price was kind of high though, we ordered just small portions because we weren't hungry. Everything was high quality, no complaints. \u00a0The other thing is they charge for the wet towels, which for the price we paid for was kind of ridiculous. \u00a0When I compare prices, this is high even for Bay Area restaurants we're accustomed to (which are pretty expensive). \u00a0 So if you don't mind the price, it is a good option for Cantonese cuisine while you're in Singapore.",

And they kill both items well!The best part is that after we feasted till we're so full, the bill was only about $20 per pax!I'm so bringing everybody here!!!",

    "text": "Really liking this Chinese restaurant. This is a must-go restaurant if you are craving for dim sum.The dim sum was top notch- \u00a0we ordered siew mai, shrimp rice roll - excellent because the rice roll wrap was thin, and the sauce complements it a lot although the sauce could be a bit more as I eat the sauce with rice.. :p, and the ha kau was delish.From the menu, we ordered a few dishes as well. We ordered kai lan in oyster sauce, and I strongly recommend you guys to order the diced beef in black pepper sauce. The beef was so tender and and the black pepper sauce was just as nice, rich but very subtle once you take a bite. The duck was also very good, and the tofu with minced beef was a great balance. \u00a0All of the food we ordered was very good- none were just okay. Definitely our favorite Chinese restaurant!",

The texture of congee will be smooth and silky with no trace of the rice grain. My favourite combi is plain congee + one serving of roasted duck. It's my comfort when I'm ill or having no appetite for whatever reason.However, if you would like to try their congee, you have to go before 8.30pm because it is often run out around the time.",

We love their Dim Sum & their ala carte dishes such as egg white with dried scallop, crab meat, black vinegar & pepper, fresh fish, roasted meat & their soup. The queue is super long during daily lunch hours & can be frustrating after a long wait. Their prices are reasonable. Worth your calories.",

All of the dishes hold up - the har gao, custard buns, XLB, etc. Of the handful of times I've been they've been consistent with everything, and I haven't had any dishes I would call a true weakness. Everything is really quite good, and the bill came out to ~$25 a head for a solid amount of food. The dining environment is nice. Service could be better - but this holds true of 90% of restaurants in Singapore. Also the location is convenient, and if there is a wait you can pass the time in the mall and not be forced to sit around waiting in front.",
