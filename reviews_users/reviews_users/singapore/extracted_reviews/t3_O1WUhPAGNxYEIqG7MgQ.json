    "text": "Japanese Dining but in Vegetarian Style? Does it ring the bell? Teng Bespoke Japanese Vegetarian Dining gives us a different take on Japanese food in a healthier way serving quality and refreshing food.If you look around, Teng Bespoke Japanese Vegetarian Dining occupies more than 1 unit space. Besides the main dining area, just look opposite of the unit and you will get to see a classy upscale dining area which is the overflow room of Teng's.Kai Lan was blanched, cut and served in a stack. They were drench with roasted sesame sauce with a handful of sesame on its top to elevate the plain healthy vegetables. Simply love its crunchy and succulency in this starter!Gai Lan Sesame Sauce - $5Teriyaki Chicken on stick looked appetizing indeed served with english parsley and pinkish ginger strips. If you asked me about its taste, well, it takes abit to be greasy and glossy to convince me.Teriyaki Chicken - $7The Unagi Maki was something I had never expected and right at that moment, I had issues convincing myself I'm actually having vegetarian dishes. Mock Unagi tasted as though they were the actual with sweet black sauce lying on top of the little rice rice with cucumbers and avocados.Unagi Maki - $15Even at a closer look, they look as good as those in the real Japanese Restaurant.Dishes were getting more interesting in this case with 3 kinds of Sashimi, mock tuna, salmon and sword fish. The presentation and food art was stunning, how did they make the \"veins\" on the fish look so real? Arrangement of food with wasabi on the bed of ice made no different as what we have someone where!Three Kind Sashimi - $19Texture was smooth and these mocked sashimi did give fellow vegetarians a very good indication of how actual sashimi taste like, lessing the natural \"fishy\" taste.The crispy and uniform cuts of the piece of deep fried meat looks none other than a slab of delicious Pork Tonkatsu pairing up with garden salad and its dressing. The texture and bite may resemble an actual pork fillet but the taste still could not hide the fact that its a piece of vegetarian product with hints of mushrooms and yam.Pork Fillet - $11Buckwheat Noodle with toufu skin and mushroom broth is delighting. Beside the smooth buckwheat noodle, fried tempura bits had given the dishes another level of texture in the dish.Buckwheat NoodleLast but not least, the grains! Fried Rice was unexpectedly scrumptious and every mouth came with a whiff of wok fire taste! Incredible! Grains were topped with brown sea vegetables (hijiki) and these vegetables are part of Japanese diet for centuries as they are rich in dietary fibre and minerals such as calcium, iron and magnesium. Who says only red meats give iron?Hjiki Fried Rice - $9Special thanks to my pal who insisted that I should give Teng Bespoke a try and it gave me another view point of having Japanese dining in a vegetarian way. One of the servers did mentioned that they have more than 1 overflow room and in fact Teng Bespoke is also serving Thai Vegetarian Food and perhaps this is why we see Lemon Grass Drink available in its menu.",

Wish I could take this whole establishment back home with me and even have them be the official caterer for every damn airline in the sky too!Enjoy.",

    "text": "Fantastic vegetarian option for Japanese/Asian food. The restaurant itself is a bit small with a main area and another room right opposite. I am assuming that this area is a private room of some sort. They charge 50 cents sg for a glass of water - I found that a bit strange. The food itself is fantastic! \u00a0The tomato spring rolls are probably the best I've had in my life and that is saying a lot. I really wanted to try the green tea or the udon noodle bowl, but since the bowls were massive, I decided to stick with sushi. I ordered the unagi rolls which were awesome. By the time the salmon rolls came along, I was pretty full. But I managed to polish that off as well. I had the mango juice - which was not that great. The service is somewhat slow so be prepared to wait between orders. I also noticed that they tack on a 10% service charge in addition to the Vat. I don't know if this is normal or if I noticed this for the first time in my many years of visiting and dining in Singapore. All in all, a great place to have some great food. Next time I will be trying the green tea noodle bowl.",

    "text": "First time having Japanese vegetarian per se and found it tasty and well presented. Definitely will be coming back and a bit more educated on the type of dishes to order. We were a bit all over the map trying all the top performing dishes, (including unagi roll, tomato spring roll, Japanese yam, and deep fried shitake mushroom with cream). \u00a0Next time we'll just focus on fewer dishes ... starting with the avocado maki roll (which is in one of the attached pictures by a prior patron).Looks like Teng has expanded as it also uses another enclosed dining space across the hall way for flow over. \u00a0Tables and chairs also populate the hallway too. For first timers, remember that this place is on the ground floor inside the Sunshine Plaza. The main dining area is a bit tight with seating fairly close to one another. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table as it was a busy weekend. Best to call ahead for reservations.And if you're vegetarian, there is also a Thai vegetarian restaurant called Pepper Jade right around the corner in the same plaza. (I'm think that these two restaurants are related based on furniture and being vegetarian, but just a first impression.) And down the hallway is a most excellent home-made ice cream shop, call \"Zero\". (Actually, there are lots of well written up restaurants (including curry puffs et al) in this Sunshine Plaza, so worth a visit ... and come hungry..",

I was searching for a vegetarian restaurant for a friend who is vegan, Teng Bespoke caught our attention as we didn't know there is a japanese vegetarian restaurant in SG. When we were at the restaurant, we immediately fell in love with their menu - so many choices! Among all that we ordered, I like the unagi maki the most. It will definitely fool someone if nobody told them it's vegetarian. I am thinking of trying the sister thai restaurant now!",

    "text": "3.5 stars.Most of all, I like the name of this place. Teng Bespoke Japanese Vegetarian Dining. At the restaurant itself, you will find no such fanfare of a long name - just a single symbol denoting Teng.We landed here on a rainy afternoon to find a packed restaurant. After waiting for a bit, we were served our menus. I like the fact that they have picture menus with item numbers. Yay for ordering simplicity! But boo for charging 50c for hot water! I instead ordered the $2.50 green tea.Among our appetizers, we much enjoyed the mushroom salad - though I was expecting the dressing to be a bit tangier. The lotus root tempura was underwhelming. Too much batter, too little flavour. For our main course, we tried the Unagi roll and the Kaki Ramen. Both were hearty and flavourful, and dare I say that we licked out plates clean! The Kaki ramen noodles were a bit thick but the sesame flavour worked well. I'm not one to comment on how authentic the Unagi was, but it was delicious for sure, sirree.In terms of service, it was pretty friendly though they did make us wait for a while. When I asked if they were open to customizing their dishes with less oil (for a friend with a dietary restriction) they were quite happy to oblige.Overall I think it is a great addition to the vegetarian dining scene in Singapore.",

Mock salmon sashimi? Sure, no prob! I love that about this restaurant, and the general taste is not bad at all! I liked the wafu radish salad, with the cashews and fried wafers providing a very satisfying crunch together with the radish. The unagi roll and avocado roll were really good as well. I liked the unagi tempura, and I really appreciate the salmon sashimi. It definitely is interesting, and not too shabby at all. In general, a great dining experience, will definitely be back.",

My most favorite is the olive fried rice. It is a big portion, good for two. Tomato spring roll were a surprise. It is a very Japanese version of pizza tempura. My partner and I love lotus root and got ourselves a lotus tempura which was also good. The Japanese Yam was also another special dish, which I had never had before. It was on the crunchy side rather than a yammy paste which I was expecting. Other things we ordered were inari sushi and hiziki salad which was ok, nothing special.",
