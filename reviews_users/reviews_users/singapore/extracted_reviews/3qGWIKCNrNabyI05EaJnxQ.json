The Paulaner is definitely not easy to reach with public transportation, so taking a cab is about the only feasible option. There is a microbrewery inside and the beer is actually quite good. Other than that, the food is almost more than the real thing: the pork legs are twice the size of those in Germany, and even my Z\u00fcrcher Geschnetzeltes (difficult to find anything not Gerrman on the menu!) was made with bacon. Beer prices are reputedly the highest in Singapore. Service was very friendly. And the interior? Guess how it looks?",

I especially like the bread dumpling. The pork knuckle had a few parts which were rather hard so maybe you can indicate that you do not want it to be too roasted. The codfish is small but the side dishes make it filling. If baked potato is not your kind of thing, perhaps ask for two servings of the fresh Brussels sprouts, broccoli and carrots with almond flakes instead. Portion is quite big so three people might want to order two dishes and share unless you are super hungry.",

It is a rather large establishment with 3-levels (bathrooms on the 3rd serviced by a lift). Our occasion was an extended work luncheon where we got to sample most of the beer and menu offerings. Even considering there was not a German person or a polka band onsite, you might imagine yourself in a German beer hall if you could forget you're actually in a mall in sweltering Singapore.The most shocking offering was the boiled pork knuckle. Although a fairly popular dish in Singapore, the boiled version is not for the faint of heart. Everything else was decently made and served. Will be back for a brew and sausage app when I am able.",

    "text": "An old secondary school friend recently suggested this popular German microbrewery bar for our quarterly meet-up; which includes lots of girl-talk, tooth-achingly sweet desserts and most importantly, rich and creamy golden goodness in the form of beer. Patrons can opt for private high-stool booths indoors as well as an alfresco style balcony on the second level. There was plenty of room for a gathering of friends, and also a romantic back-drop complete with the Singapore Flyer for couples on a date. I would personally suggest getting a seat early in the evening before the night crowd swarms, and getting their signature Munich lager straight away to take advantage of their 1-for-1 beers between 12 to 8pm. Their fried Pork Knuckles was a heart-attack-sized platter of melt in your mouth meat, with a side of buttery German mashed potato. Don't forget their specialty of grilled sausages - the best way to try them all would be the Paulaner Sausage Pan, which features 5 of their top picks in a single platter. Finish it off with Caramelized Bavarian Emperor's Pancake, with warm fluffy chunks of buttered batter coated in crispy sugar, served with caramelized apple sauce; every sugar-high-junkie's dream! Being stuffed as we were, it's best to get the chit chat out of the way by 9 and enjoy as their live band gets on stage to croon their way through jazzy and country numbers, with a song request segment after each set. \u00a0A cheeky request of the popular radio anthem 'We Are Young' was gamely attempted by the guitar-strumming uncles, to much applause and appreciative sing-along, making it the perfect rowdy end to a cozy night out.",

If this is what you're feeling on a Sunday morning, Paulaner Brauhaus fits your demands to a T.Step in and be amazed at their triple storey restaurant that includes a bar and a brewery and an outdoors corner for those who like to bask in the sun on Sundays... but patrons flock here by the dozens for their fill of authentic Bavarian food fare.When one thinks of German food, bratwursts and pickles come to mind. You won't find many pickles, but sausages, you will find, in plain bounty. Meet the juiciest sausages you'll have the greatest pleasure of eating, the Th\u00fcringer, (Cheese, and without), Debreziener, and N\u00fcrnberger. Slap on some authentic German mustard made with freshy ground mustard seed to balance the savouriness with some zest, or drench your bratwurst in curry sauce, and enjoy.Don't get too full on the sausages though. There's always room for their crispy pork knuckles. As big as two of your fists put together, this culinary delight is sure to send your taste buds into overdrive. Sink your teeth into the tenderness of the knuckles and be delighted by the unexpected juiciness that squirts out of the flesh.Wash everything down with a mug of beer straight from their brewery and please don't be afraid to let out a belch - that's your stomach thanking you for all that food, glorious food.",
