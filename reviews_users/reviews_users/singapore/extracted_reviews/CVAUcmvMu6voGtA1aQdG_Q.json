    "text": "standout indian food in the grastronomic wunderland that is katong - I don't usually come to this area because it's a little far out of my reach, but the many good reviews of this place were too great a draw to resist. and they live up to it - indian food made modern, really in the style of masala zone in london, which I haven't yet seen in singapore - I would say this is food that admittedly might play more to the mainstream consumer's idea of indian rather than traditional fare, but it doesn't detract from the pleasure of eating here, and judging from the clientele in this place - it might not be wholly unauthentic either.you do pay for the experience though - prices are much higher than what you'd see at other indian joints, though merely on par with other new caf\u00e9s/bistros. service is a little absent-minded sometimes - though this only happened with one of their waitresses - but the food is well good, and well worth coming back for.",

But cold, which got me wondering if it was sitting on the counter for the past hour. And the rice was last to come, isnt that ridiculous? Fish tikka was first, cold... I think its the same dish i saw when i passed by when i walked past the couple of time. And for the price, i could get the same or better. Not impressed",

I always get excited to see Indian restaurants get recognition.It's good and definitely hits the Indian food craving. It looks like they have a significant service issue since there are many Yelpers mentioning it, but I was lucky since the restaurant was mostly empty when I was there. I was the only one getting food so service was alright.I ordered the following:1) Papdi Chaat - It was good, not the best but definitely good.2) Butter Chicken - Hit the spot. Again, its good but doesn't stand out compared to other restaurants in SG.3) Plain Naan - Excellent Naan4) Sweet Lassi - Pretty bad. Maybe the yogurt was already spoilt.Lunch was decently priced. Although I don't understand the reason for Michelin's recognition here, I would come back for lunch if I was craving Indian and was around the East Coast area.",

Our order:I came here with my mum for lunch and we ordered 2 set meals - available now weekdays from 1130am - 2pm, if i remember correctly. I got the Tandoori Naan set which included 2 pieces of chicken; naan; biryani rice and the sauces + curryMum got the Vegetarian naan set which had basically the same things except for the chickenTaste:Tandoori Naan Set:The chicken was coated in some yummy goodness (i actually don't know what it was marinated int) which tasted ahmazing. To my surprise, it wasn't really spicy as I thought it would be - how stereotypical of me!The naan was hot when it was served and tasted absolutely spectacularBiryani - i've never had biryani before but according to my mum, it was one of the best ones she's had and trust me, she's pretty picky about her food. Yoghurt - this was one of the \"sauces\" (not sure if that's the correct term) in the set and i really liked itCurry - ahaha i personally found this a tad spicy but nevertheless it was superbAs for the Vegetarian naan set, once again, mum said it was the best.Portion:We were initially a bit skeptical to order 2 sets because we though it'd come out huge, however, the portion was just enough for one person.Service:Because it was our first time there and it was my first time trying Indian cuisine, I didn't really know what to order. The waiter tried recommending some things to me but I didn't quite grasp what he was trying to say... Nevertheless, service was fast and the staff were friendlyPrice:This place is definitely a bit pricey and is not one of the places you'll visit every day. However, for the food served, it's definitely worth it.Overall, I really enjoyed my first real Indian cuisine of my lifeeee and i've fallen in love with Indian food... hehe :))OH AND SET MEAL CAME WITH A DRINK!",

Their ambiance is great, they have iPad menus that are easy to navigate and work, and it's kid-friendly. Their service could use a little more work, though.The first time we came here, it took almost half an hour for our food to arrive. The second time, I was one of the first to arrive for lunch and it took a little under 20 minutes. To echo the other reviews, the servers are a bit distant, but I get it- you don't need to remind me where I am.I was surprised about their naan lunch sets- it lives up to it's name as it comes with 4 large pieces of fluffy naan! Very filling. I also liked all the sides that came with it, and my butter chicken hit the spot. If you're looking for a good veggie side, their aloo gobi is my favourite!Service may not be the best, but I know I'll be back.",

Thanks to the Yelp app, via Check-in, I discovered that it took 27 min! for the food to be served. Fortunately, it was the entire order, which consisted of Butter Naan, butter Chicken, Basmati rice and aloo gobi. When the attendant delivered the food, we didn't have any utensils at the table and had to kindly ask the diners/table next to us for their unused set. (Hint: the service staff should've done this for us). Despite it's suspect service, Zaffron delivers excellent Indian Cuisine within a modern restaurant exterior. The butter chicken was definitely my favorite dish of the ones I ordered. Not as good as my favorite North Indian restaurant in Novena, but good nonetheless. The sauce was thicker and darker in colour and a tad less sweet. Overall, Zaffron delivers 4-star food with 2-3 star service. If you are craving for great Indian good in the Katong area, but are happy to wait just a little longer than normal for food, then Zaffron is an excellent choice!",

The portions are larger than expected. We were impressed. The restaurant is child friendly with a little play area. Very casual atmosphere, perfect for a family dinner. Service was good. We had the fortune of interacting with the restaurant manager Dinesh. He was very service oriented and we had a pleasant chat. I suspect that previous reviews had them working on improving service and it has seemed to work. We noticed that the other staff provided service with a smile, though there is still some way to go on in that while they did serve well it did not seem genuine. They need to do a little polishing. A credible performance. Perhaps in time Dinesh's example and training will rub off on them. We had a great evening and the cost of a full meal was about $30 per person. Very affordable.

Other reviews cite good experiences though, so maybe I just caught them at a bad time or something. Anyway. If you're vegetarian most Indian places are full of options and Zaffron is no different. My favs are the Tandoori Gobi or the Tandoori Mushrooms. In the curries section, their Dhal Mahkani is probably the best I've tried anywhere. Ever. Their naan is pretty spectacular as well, but the curries go really well with rice, so it's a tricky decision. I'd say go with lots of friends and order lots of things. What really adds to the experience is the presentation of the food, which is pretty and quite stylish. The waiters aprons also have clever food-based slogans on them which is fun to read. Do make a reservation as it's quite crowded usually, and every time I walk past at dinner time there's a long queue. There's also a play area for children which looks like so much fun I've always been tempted to sneak in. Also, popcorn machine!",

The chicken chettinad was very spicy and I really liked the taste. We dipped the naan into the curry and it was simply perfect. The chicken was also very tender and the meat came apart easily. The chicken tikka was another of our favorites. There was a distinct and nice grilled flavor to the chicken, and the meat was succulent and tender.Overall, we had a great Indian meal here and would definitely be back.",

For my group meal the service was good, for most other meals the service was awful, the food has always been good. The service has been improving, they have chosen to go the route of self ordering iPads and decreasing the actual staff to guest interaction. This technique has worked well to improve the \"Service.\"The food has always been very good, it has been what has kept people coming back, their front Tandoor churns out good smoky tasting food including Naans and Daal Makhani.Aside from the food, the real draw is the family friendly atmosphere with a kids play area in the back, including a play house and even children sized sinks and toilets. Although, now that I think about it, the staff is just as indifferent to the kids as they are to everyone. The food quality will reward you for returning, the kids area will let you enjoy the food, and the staff seem to be getting trained to stay away!",

Will go again next time I am in the city. Love!",

    "text": "Rich Indian food with very mediocre service and indifferent attitude.As a family of 5, we recently went to Zaffron Kitchen for lunch, as one of my daughter's friends had recommended it to her.Initially we were very impressed, because as we sat down we were handed out a tablet to look at the menu and order the food. However, we soon realized that the restaurant had basically done away with almost all waiters.The description of dishes on the menu was inadequate and the sole waiter in the restaurant was clueless.We were keen to try out some their kebabs, as they looked appetizing in the kitchen window. We were debating between ordering separate kebab dishes or a kebab platter, which had an assortment of Kebabs. We wanted to make sure that we ordered adequate amount of kebabs. The menu did not state how many pieces each portion had and our waiter had no idea. After much back and forth we were told that each individual kebab portion has 5 pieces and the platter has 4 pieces each of 5 types of kebab. When I confirmed that the platter had 20 pieces, we decided to order the platter, as we thought that would be the right amount to order.When the kebab platter arrived, it only had 3x5 that is 15 pieces. When we asked, we were told by the restaurant manager that it only has 15 pieces and our waiter gave us the wrong information. The restaurant manager made no attempt to find a solution, ie either take additional order, or allow us to cancel and reorder, leave alone the gesture that any other restaurant would have made of making it up by topping the platter with additional 5 pcs as were initially told. From there on the experience went down hill.The kebabs were very greasy, we had under ordered, so we had to ask for the tablet again as they would not accept the order any other way.Besides the service snafu and rich (greasy and creamy food), the pricing was high for Indian food on the East Coast Road area.Unlikely that we will go back or recommend it to any of our friends, unless the service improves.",

Too many aircon units can make the place uncomfortably cold, however the staff are willing to adjust it.I experienced both very good and very slow, inattentive service where it can take 15 minutes to receive the bill. Food is consistently good, not the service.",

    "text": "Zaffron is a relative newcomer to the buzzy eatery lined stretch of Katong. It's unpretentious and serves up authentic North and South Indian food. It's not much of a stretch to say that almost all the items on the menu are hits. The butter chicken is a must try - succulent meat swathed with gravy, fish masala is fork tender, and the naans are great. My group did find the Kashmiri naan a little unusual though, as it didn't quite go with the rest of our savory items. The kulfi was interesting, though some detected a hint of cardamon, and it did not agree to those who were averse to the spice. Due to the popularity of the restaurant, service can be a little spotty. The decor is very pretty though, and there's a play corner for kids to busy themselves at. The A/C is very cold, but happily, the service is warm. If you can catch the servers' attention, that is.",
