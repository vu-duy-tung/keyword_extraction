GET THIS. it is amazingly tender, and the soup is even more peppery than the normal soup. the kidney and liver were also perfect for me. i prefer my kidney cut a bit thicker (with the x cuts that make them look like cooked cuttlefish), and that's how they do them here. delicious.",

    "text": "I'm not an expert at Singapore-style (Teochew-style) peppery bak kut teh. I far, far prefer the herby Klang version one finds over in Malaysia. For that reason, I tend to avoid bak kut teh in Singapore and haven't had this in a very long time. But a group dinner where the decision was out of my hands forced me back into the clear, peppery pork land of Songfa.Is this a good or bad version of Singapore BKT? I don't know, guys. I don't like the dish that much so it's hard for me to say. I can tell you that I found the ribs to be of average quality, the meat just didn't fall off the bone the way it should have. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by the tenderloin pork. I'm pretty lazy so having my pork chopped up in bite-size chunks versus needing to gnaw at big bits of bone was kind of nice.I also like how they keep refilling the soup. It would be even better if it was the herby Klang soup but, no matter. Warm soup is always a pleasure.But I must admit, I'm rather mystified by the tea arrangement. Why do I get my tea in a packet of leaves and then have to boil my own water? I just don't get it. But then, like I said, I'm pretty lazy.",

So finally one day, when the queue was not that long, and when you go on your own its usually not that hard to get a table for one, I got myself a seat and ordered. And I was very disappointed. Yes, people may say that : ya ya, you from Malaysia, you are use to a different type of BKT. My reply : Yes, Malaysia has different types of BKT - for example Klang BKT which is more gravy that soup and oh-so-flavourful - I am from KK, where BKT is very much like those found here, but tastes sooooooooo much better. I'm use to something more herbal based, or some more pepper base, but always with clear soup. So I was disappointed and wonder still why the reviews are so good. I ordered the most basic of pork ribs and a side of vege and of course deep fried dough fritters. Did not really enjoy the meal. Mind you, I had decent BKT here in Singapore before, just not at this place.",

Having been told that Bak Kut Teh is supposed to be the Singaporean dish to be tried, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give it a go.I ordered one order of BKT, one order of pork knuckle and one order of steamed rice. Everything was brought out lightning quick, which was perfect since I was seriously starved. Oh, i should mention that smaller the group the quicker you get seated in between customers - me having gone solo I was given a seat almost instantly.Food was excellent - although I cannot compare the BKT to any other place as I did not have the time to go check out other places. I will say though one of my favourite meals in Singapore was this!",

The queue was extremely long when we came in the evening, but found that the wait was cut in half to sit inside. I'm not sure if people were aware that you could sit inside to the right of the tables... We get the premium ribs... there is a difference in quality. The broth is a good balance of pepper and garlic, though as a garlic lover I ask for extra. The meat is nice and tender and of course the savory broth is all-you-can-slurp. I wished the youtiao was fresher, hot, and crispy when it comes out, but it's not bad with rice. We also got kway chop, but it was too salty and the texture was off. Song Fa is definitely a solid choice.",

I had two dishes of this - which attests to gluttony and tolerance in the face of a favorite dish to the comfortingly tender meat and decent flavor. no overtly gamey porkiness here, if you're afraid of that, and the braise is tasty.",

They serve the usual soup with generous helpings of succulent meat with the delicious 'boiled-all-day' taste that our grannies used to make for us, and soups are refillable! It's a nice homey touch to a modern day looking restaurant that adds a dash of nostalgia of the olden days. The soup is not too peppery and still thick enough with both spices and meat, so it's actually possible for young kids to mix it with plain rice for a meal without any additional seasoning. Their side dishes are also yummy like pork innards if you find that acceptable, and honestly locals have no qualms since it's considered as quite the delicacy and 'good for our health' somehow.",

    "text": "I've never had Bak Kut Teh before, so my Singaporean friends of course wanted to drag me here! We came on a Wednesday night with a party of 6. I heard the line would be quite long so I actually got there like 5-10 minutes before the rest of my friends got there, and even though it was fairly busy, I managed to snag a table quite quickly, albeit right next to the door. I guess I'm pretty lucky!Anyways, given that I was new to the entire thing, I had my Singaporean friends make recommendations on what to order.I myself got a large bowl of pork ribs, lime juice, a bowl of rice, and a pork trotter dish to share. I didn't actually know what trotter was, and when I found out that trotter = feet, I was like.. oh that's obvious. My friends said it was good so we got an order.You get like 3 ribs with the large order. The ribs themselves are very soft and tender, bit lightly flavored as a lot of the flavor has gone into the soup, but it was very good and what I expected.The broth is great! It's rich, warm, and delicious!I loved the lime juice too! I should get more lime juice drinks in the future... as long as the Mexican lime crisis concludes.The trotter was decent. Perhaps not really to my taste though, maybe I didn't like the texture.All in all, it came out to be like 12-ish a person. Awesome price for delicious food.Would totally come back next time I'm in Singapore. Hooray for Singaporean food!",

    "text": "Song Fa Bak Kut Teh is truly one of the great Bak Kut Teh locations in Singapore. If you're familiar with my reviews, you know I'm a HUGE fan of Bak Kut Teh, Singapore's Pork Rib Pepper Soup. I came to Song Fa on a rainy Saturday on the back drop of LKY's passing. The restaurant was full of locals, who had spent hours in line to pay their last respects to Mr. Lee who lay temporarily at Parliament, less than km away. Given the rainy weather outside and the somber mood that Singapore has experienced this past week, there is no better dish than, in my view, Bak Kut Teh to warm a person's heart. I ordered the Premium Pork Rib Soup, but to my disappointment, it was of out stock. I settled on the regular Pork Rib Soup, which to my great surprise was tender and moist. Regular Pork Rib orders, at other Bak Kut Teh establishments,are generally quite dry. Although I find Founders Bak Kut Teh in Balestier to be my personal favorite, Song Fa is a very close second. If you are a visitor to Singapore and don't want to venture outside the CBD area or travel to Balestier Road, then Song Fa is your best to try this famous SG dish!",

Okay, fine, let's goThirty minutes of waiting in line later, we are seated on barely stable plastic chairs that essentially on the street. I don't say this disparagingly, some of the truly best food is at places that don't waste their time, energy, and money on needless pretensions. Our group ordered almost one of everything on the menu. The famed ribs and the soup it came in was disappointingly average, the meat tasted like most of the flavor was boiled out of it. I guess the soup benefitted from that, and you can get unlimited soup refills. The thing is, everyone loves that this soup is peppery, but it's so peppery that the other flavors are overwhelmed. It just seems counter-productive that they went through a hard-core famous cooking process to make great quality broth then mask it.",

I think if you would like an above average bak kut teh with a reasonable comfortable ambience which is not too expensive and yet located in a very centralised place (its just opposite The Central), the question you have to ask yourself is \"why not?\"",

    "text": "Throughout my years of living in the Lion City of Singapore, there are a few foods that seem to make virtually every \"Top 10 Foods of Singapore\" List. One of those dishes is \"Bak Kut Teh\" or \"Pork Rib Soup\" and our favorite place to eat this delectable goodness is SONGFA BAK KUT TEH.According to the SONGFA website: Bak Kut Teh is a Chinese soup popularly served in Singapore. The name literally translates as \"meat bone tea\", and, at its simplest, consists of meaty pork ribs in a complex broth of herbs and spices boiled together with pork bones for hours. Bak kut teh was introduced to Malaya in the 19th century by Chinese workers from Canton, Chaoshan and Fujian. So what does this mean to the average joe like you or I? Not too much, other than to know that this is a historically simple and good dish that has been served on this side of the planet for eons and it's damn good.SONGFA is always crowded and they move people through quickly, think of it as local fast food. The menu is filled with a lot of local delicacies that may be a bit tough for an untested Western palette (like Pig Organ Soup or braised Chicken Feet) but if I may be so bold order this: Pork Ribs Soup, Dough Fritters & Kai Lan, you won't be disappointed. And the best part? The broth is bottomless, so the goodness will keep on going.I know it might seem odd to get excited about soup in the warm & muggy climate of Singapore but the flavors make up for it, this is home cooking at its local fast food finest. So if you are near the Quays and looking for something quick, cheap and filling, I heartily recommend SONGFA BAK KUT TEH, the goodness will not disappoint!",

Most Bakuteh joints in Singapore are pretty decent. It's a national staple. 1. The pork broth was great. They could be a bit more generous with the pork ribs though. 2. You tiao - is cold and soggy. Do not order. Unless you intend only to dip it in the soup (commonly eaten this way in Singapore) then its lack of crispiness is tolerable. 3. Would not recommend ordering the Pig's throttles in black sauce - too much pig skin and fats. Very little meat. Price range - 10 per pax.",

    "text": "On cold nights or rainy days, i often find myself craving for hot peppery soup and that's when i'll head down to Song Fa Ba Kut Teh to warm up my shivering tummy.My favorite bkt is the clear soup (otherwise called white soup) which is packed with lotsa black and white pepper. Not a fan of the black herbal sort (too much herbs for me). Verdict? The soup is not bad, savory enough and is very aromatic. The meat is so tender, it peels off the bone with a light tug of your teeth. The ribs absorbs the flavor of the soup so thoroughly you don't even have to dip it in too much dark sauce to give it the extra flavor. I have tried both the premium and the regular ribs here and the regular ones are much better. Trust me on this one. The regular rib is better than Founder's premium ribs as well. For $8 you would get the large bowl and that's about 6 ribs. On good days i can finish that by myself.If you want more food, other dishes such as the braised intestines (really well marinated and clean), pork trotters (braised and melt-in-your-mouth meat!), chicken feet (i don't eat this) etc are pretty awesome too. If you like variety, you could go for the mixed soup of your choice- you could choose ribs, stomach, tail bone etc in the pork bone soup. Me? I'd just go for the regular pork rib bkt. :)There are 2 outlets along New Bridge Road, i always go to the air conditioned one. It's from the same kitchen and the prices are the same so why not dine in comfort right?",

Food is served in 5 minutes or less and you pay when the food is served - no need to chase done the waitstaff to pay after your meal. I wish more places did this. 3. Simple, delicious food. The food tastes fresh, with simple clean flavors. A lot of food in SE Asia includes tons of spice, which can be overwhelming meal after meal. The flavors here are much more subtle, providing a nice change. Furthermore this is one of the few places I've found in Singapore where it's easy to eat low-carb/slow-carb, just go sans rice!And the price is right! Large soup S$9, side of veggies S$4. Highly recommend!",

It came out rather fast, was piping hot and looked delicious. And the soup was delicious in a simple home cooked way. The pork bones were meaty, tender, and my guide pointed out that there were 2 grades of pork rib bones but looked similar to me. I noticed there was a lot of white pepper used to flavor the broth. So who woulda thought the simple clear soup mom has been making for the last 40 years was a close version of the Bak Kut Teh... Now that I've came, saw, and experienced, I know how to glam up mom's brew!",

    "text": "Bak kut teh was something that was on my must-eat list when visiting Singapore. With the help of yelpers in Singapore, I found Song Fa. This place is legit as you can see lots of local people eating here! Get here early as they fill up fast, and the lines get quite outrageous. They even have a sign out front where they update how long the wait is for a table. I love the interior decor. Makes it feel homey, even though the tables are pretty close to each other. The tables along the walls have their own sinks and heated tea pots for those who want hot tea. The must order of course is their Pork ribs bak kut teh. The ribs are fall off the bone tender, and the soup is full of garlic and peppery goodness. Get an order of noodles to eat with this soup! And if you run low on soup, they give free refills on soup! Their braised chicken feet with beancurd is also very good. The chicken feet are braised very soft, and the flavors are spot on! They even sell soup packets for you to make your own bak kut teh at home, just need to add garlic and ribs! Its about 2 blocks away from the Clarke Quay subway station, so super convenient.",

    "text": "Song Fa = SolidI can't believe it took me so long to get to this famous bak kut teh spot! This Clarke Quay location always has a queue, but when we visited over the weekend it wasn't too bad.As they were out of the premium long ribs, we settled for the regular pork rib soup. At my first sip of soup, I could tell right away that it was flavourful, but not as peppery as Founder's on Balestier. I still prefer Founder's broth, but don't get me wrong- Song Fa's is still very, very good.For me, a lot of bak kut teh places fall flat when it comes to the quality of the pork meat. Sometimes it's dry and tough, which puts a damper on the dish. However, Song Fa passes this test with flying colours- I was amazed at how juicy and tender their pork meat was. How did they do it?! I guess that's their secret. In my opinion, this is where they're better than Founder's.I only deduct one star because I wasn't too much a fan of their you tiao. I found it slightly greasy and not very fluffy. It took me a while to really chew it 'til it got soft enough. But overall, I understand why people flock here. It's location is tourist friendly, the prices are good, and the al fresco vibe really gives you a local Singaporean experience!",

It always tastes rather bitter with a chinese medicine smell...And served in those brown clay pot. Which totally make a medi dish. :( But the soup remains sweet, salty and fresh. I know this sounds wired, but it is one of the best pork bone dish. Okay, let us talk about the authenticity here in S'pore. Pure soup, pure \u00a0pork bone soup. With herbs, seafood, some grandma's soup. Not those 10+ hour Canto style. Very simple homemade soup. I almost doubt was there any msg? Haha. The drinks sucks here.Oh soup is free refill.

    "text": "There are two Songfa Bak Kut Teh locations within 30 feet of one another. The one facing New Bridge Road is indoors. The other wrapping around the street is outdoors. Considering the humidity of Singapore, I opted for the indoor Songfa with rotating fans.There weren't many customers since it was past peak hours of lunch. However at 2:30 pm--during the first half hour into my dine--couples, groups of friends and a crew of middle-aged men trickled in. 80% of the restaurant was occupied. Half an hour later they stealthily left as they had come.The interior contained black-and-white photos of Clark Quay and color photos of their dishes. With questions sprouting in my mind regarding the food and its history, I inquired the waitresses. They didn't speak much English so it was up to my imagination and Google to answer my curiosities.I ordered a small bowl of Pork Ribs Soup, also known as \"bak kut teh\" and \"meat bone soup.\" The soup had a strong presence of black pepper. The soft garlic cloves dissolved as you gently squeezed the meat out of them. Some of the pork ribs were soft. Others had a slightly dry texture even when rehydrated in the soup. If you run low on hot soup, ask a server for free refills.Usually Bak Kut Teh is paired with rice or noodles. Instead I consumed it with a small plate of Choi Sum topped off with garlic chips. The vegetables were seasoned just enough to have flavor, but not so much that it would take away attention from the soup.Each table has a pot and mini sink. You boil your own cup of tea. As for me I drank their Homemade Water Chestnut, which can be ordered cold or warm. It tasted medicinal with a slight sweetness.My bill totaled to $11.80 SGD ($9.39 USD). And yes, they charged 20 cents for the wet tissue. Dear Singapore, what do you have against dry napkins?PS: The tiny bathrooms here should be illegal. Consider using the toilet before eating. Eat first, then go? Good luck! Every inch counts. The men and women's bathroom should be combined. Aside from lavatory woes, I'd come back for more Songfa Bak Kut Teh.",

Service here is pretty fast, and you pay on the spot when food is served. I ordered the pork rib with pig stomach combo, which was decent. The pork rib was soft and the soup was peppery. We also ordered kai lan, salted vegetable, and marinated pig intestine to share. I love the pig intestine. Decently cleaned and marinated well - not too salty. I also appreciate how they come around and offer soup refills :) Definitely recommended for a night bak kut teh hunt near Clark Quay!",

    "text": "Bak Kut Teh is one of those dishes that inspire a sense of heritage and at the same time could be a hot topic to debate over the style and where is the best. Now, I am not claiming to be an expert by any means, but Song Fa is producing a pretty impressive teocheow version that I would go back for more. The flavors are simple: Pork ribs slowly cooked in a light pepper and garlic broth. Yet when you have the first sip of the broth, you realize you are having something far more complicated. The flavor is clean and to the point, yet the layers that develop make you keep sipping till you forget that there are pork ribs to enjoy. The pork was tender and at that point where it was still just about to fall of the bone, yet not quite pliable where it became difficult to eat. The side dish options are pretty respectable and give that nice balance of flavor that you end up craving. Service was quick and efficient. As you wait in the line, be prepared to order, because the your dishes will arrive as soon as your butt hits the chair/stool. There is an efficiency to their process and you will be quick to enjoy your dishes, while helping them keep their line moving.Definitely would go back! It's quick service, nice location, and pretty impressive dishes make me a fan.",

My uncle, however, was aware and arranged for my family to all go for dinner one night during our stay in Singapore.I had actually passed by this location while walking back to our hotel. Then we came back that same night to have dinner here! There had already been a line when I passed earlier, and there still was one when we arrived.Food is served fast so the line moves pretty quick. Customers are constantly moving through the restaurant at a fast rate. We had a party of 12 and were split into three tables throughout the seating area.You order food while you're waiting in line, so the food arrived as soon as we sat down! The soup was sooo good. TRULY BOTTOMLESS. I was trying so hard to drink my soup as fast as possible but as soon as I was two sips away from the bottom the waitress would be refilling my soup! Eventually, I did have to stop her, as I was getting very full from the soup alone. The pork rib itself was great - came right off the bone and right into my big belly. We also got some veggies as a side dish and some pork belly. Mmmmm.My mom and bf both ended up buying their soup base packets. Can't wait to try it out at home!",

So my girlfriend decided this was something I had to have during my visit.I don't recall what my husband ordered. He had the spare rib soup that was boneless and said it tasted pretty regular. My girlfriend ordered the fish which was surprisingly good. Not too fishy but the soup is pretty neutral. I had their signature dish.. the black-peppered spare rib soup. Its definitely different from what I've had before. Good but not wowed by it. I'm not sure if this is a local favorite dish but it feels like this is something neutral for tourists like me. Not too heavy and not super bland. Just the perfect balance in flavor to give you that savory taste. But I wasn't wowed by this place in all honesty. It wasn't something out of the ordinary and something quite simple to make at home. I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends who wanted to visit Singapore... unless they want to eat on the safe side.. this is probably closest to safe without being too salty, too sweet.. too strong or too overwhelming.",

Strong and mostly white pepper flavor with subtle herbal essence.Not cheap eats. Small bowl with small portion. Very little soup. When asked for soup refill, we didn't get it until the 3rd request. Soon after food was served, server asked for payment. And soon after payment was made, service disappeared along with condiments. Tactics to get people to leave? And not linger around?",

    "text": "Per recommendations and reviews, this was my first Bak Kut Teh here in Singapore. First off, It's nice that there is the corner restaurant and the one a few doors down. The corner one was busy so I went to the one that was indoors and was greeted by the person working the queue. It was still busy but lucky me it was less than 5 minutes wait since it was toward the end of lunch. Also, there was AC which was a nice break from the heat and while eating. I ordered while I was waiting so the service was extra quick! I had a bowl of Bak Kut Teh and Kai Lan. The soup was good but I found it was quite peppery. The meat was flavorful, tender, and fell off the bone. I initially thought there wasn't enough soup but they come around and top up your bowl with hot soup after you've eaten a rib so there's more room; definitely a plus. Also, give it a try and taste the meat with the condiments provided. Overall the service and people were nice, food came quickly, and it was flavorful and tender. Also the conscientious location is also a plus. Tip1: Try to go during off peak hours so you have a shorter queueTip2: I believe it is cash only so be sure you have some on you. You pay once you get your food at your table",

Our premium loin ribs looked impressive but the meat was super tough and dry. The standard ribs were surprisingly much softer and flavoursome. The soup was not overwhelmingly peppery but just enough to make you sweat. Not the best bkt place we've been to unfortunately and there's nothing that would entice us to come back anytime soon.",

The soup can be tasteless at times though after a top up it can pack a punch of peppery goodness. It does not taste like it has been made with actual ribs, slow cooking for hours, lacking the natural sweetness and taste of home cooked soup. As it is perennially crowded with tourists and locals, the staff is very efficient in seating customers and clearing tables. It really reminds me of the game \"Diner Dash\". I always feel like I am in the live version of it when eating here. To shorten any potential time wasting, diners are expected to pay when the food arrive, just like in some coffee shops and hawker centers. So you can just leave once you are done with your meal. The pork ribs is tender but not that tender that the meat can slid right off without some coaxing. The side dishes are ok. I will only come here when I want sliced fish in bkt broth or if I am in the area. Otherwise, there are probably other better bkt around.I believe this is a CASH only place.",

If you don't want miscellaneous charges, you just return the wet naps when you pay\u00a0and they take it off your final bill.\u00a0I wished I knew that tidbit in advance!For food, we got the popular pork rib soup and a few other dishes, like cai xin (mustard greens), braised chicken feet and braised pork belly to share among the three of us. The pork ribs were tender and fell off the bone, while the soup was heavy in white pepper. It wasn't too spicy since the heat level dissipated after a few seconds. It was so delicious.\u00a0The pork belly was super fatty, gelatinous and flavorful. The chicken feet for me was just comfort food. Both portions were relatively small, but tasty. The greens were there for balance haha.Anyway, food is legit and service is very quick! Once the food arrives, you pay before you eat so you can bounce out when you're done.",

It was \u00a0the poor man's broth back in the days, but regarded as one of the national dishes of both Singapore and Malaysia .Song Fa is one of the most popular Bak Kut Teh places in Singapore. In fact they are so popular now that they ha e to open 2 more outlets along the same street within walking distance, so that customers don't have to wait too long for their pork broth. They have braised pork as well. Choose from pork ribs, trotters, organs (liver, kidney, intestines, etc).",

Do not get the premium pork loin soup... it's just not as tasty in my opinion. \u00a0Skip the pork belly unless you want super fatty chunks with not a lot of meat (maybe it's meant to be eaten like that... I don't know).  \u00a0 \u00a0 The broth in the pork rib soup is really something special. \u00a0Okay, I'm a tourist so I don't know how it's supposed to taste or how genuine it is but I do travel a lot and I have never tasted anything quite like this. The broth is perfectly salted and it has an herby smokey flavor, very satisfying. \u00a0I liken it to a tea based broth. \u00a0In my opinion it was pretty inexpensive given it's in Clarke Quay. $9 for a large bowl, approx. $6.85 US dollars.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Overall, its a great place for a tourist like me to get a taste of the local cuisine. \u00a0I felt like I was transported to another time and place. \u00a0A time when Singapore was more simple and less of a global smart city (which I think is pretty damn great fyi).",

It had the proper combination of fat and skinny meat. The sauce made the dish even more tastier. I gotta warn that this place gets pretty crowded and the wait line can take up to 1hr or more.

But as you are eating the bones and the soup, they come around and refill your bowl with more soup! The big benefit of that is that the soup always tastes super hot, because there's only so much soup at any given time, and every time you get more, the soup pipping hot, which keeps the experience super enjoyable.The broth has a rich tasty pork taste, with a bit of pepper in it. It was a hearty, warm loving soup and I personally liked the amount of pepper, I thought it balanced the soup really well.The Cai Lan was also pretty good, as well as the Lemon Tea.

Side dishes are bit salty. It also came with a bowl of rice.It's stereotypical Singaporean. Small dishes and lots of soup.I'm not complaining but the broth soup thing must be lost on westerners who did not grow up with soup.The soup is almost white in color and they refill it from a kettle made for tea. Thus, the name translates into meat bone tea. However, this thick broth is exactly the kind of thing Asians grew up on, especially southern (Cantonese) Chinese. I would love to come back, but knowing my immediate family, which I put them under the white people category, this is not something they'd be up for. \u00a0So save this meal trip with fellow soup aficionados!",

So the pork rib is very tender and absolutely amazing, it's flavorful and juicy. We ordered some vegetables for the table, bowl of rice and some other side dishes but honestly the pork rib soup the star of the entire place. As you are eating your entire meal, be careful not eat all of the meat immediately because they will come around and REFILL your BROTH!! The broth is sooo friggin good, it is peppery and rich and just so amazing. Like I was able to enjoy rice with broth and it was so worth it. I'm not sure what their secret recipe is for the broth but you can tell they spend a lot of hours to make the broth. They also sell packages of the broth seasoning in case you want to make it from home. Which i am a little upset that I did not buy. If you are visiting Singapore, it is definitely a must to just stop in for a bowl of pork rib broth.Not necessary to order the other vegetables and side dishes, but definitely order a bowl of rice to go with the soup. Make sure to maximize the number of refills!! I was able to get three!!!",

The soup, it's super thin (like most Asian soup) and so good! For the two of us we ordered:One order of ribsOne veggie dish One pork belly sideOne bowl of rice One small order or fried dough Meal was more than enough to feed us both, and very tastyService was quick. Food came out quick too. Once all the food arrived to table, they bring the check over. When you are ready to pay, walk up the bill to cashier",

I understand that the broth is supposed to be garlic-y/peppery but the pepper taste was overwhelming. The pork belly also tasted pretty average. I got a stomachache after eating here which makes me think that their soup was filled with MSG.",

The meat is SO TENDER and literally falls off the bone. We got 2 large ones + other dishes to share amongst 3 people and it was just the right amount of food; however, we all agreed that we each could've finished our own bak kut teh. I recommend one per person (they have both regular and large.. large = more meat) If I ever go back to Singapore, I'll definitely visit Song Fa again!",

We walked from our hotel to this place which was about a little over a mile. When we arrived there was no line but the place was 95% full. They don't have a very extensive menu because they specialize in pork rib soup. \u00a0We both got a bowl of soup, a bowl of rice and the husband order pig intestines. We both ordered drinks too. We were both hot from the walk. The soups came out fairly quick and the intestines. Our drinks came out soon after. The soup was amazing even when it was hot out! The pork falls right off the bone and they give you fresh red chili and you add your own soy sauce. The intestine were really good too. They were braised in a sweet soy sauce. Our drinks were good too. We ordered a barley and 2 lime juices. I think lime juice is Singapores version of lemonade. Our meal was super cheap. Before we left Singapore we made another stop for more soup and this time I learned you can ask for more soup broth! We bought the soup packets to bring home to recreate the soup. I hope it will taste just like it!",

    "text": "My favorite Bak Kut Teh is the clear soup (otherwise called white soup) which is packed with lots of black and white pepper. Not a fan of the black herbal sort (too much herbs for me). The you tiao wasn't that crispy because I guessed it was pre-fried, but it didn't really matter because we were drowning it in the soup anyway. The soft dough with all the soup absorbed is just plain happiness. This is the new store that opened near the old stall. It actually looks more clean and spacious compared to the old shop front. But it somehow lacks the old feel, like this one feels more commercialized and less authentic. But the favorite Bak Kut Teh is still nice.It is located conveniently near Clarke quay mrt station. Once you step out at the burger king side you can see it opposite the road. One of the better favorite Bak Kut Teh i have tried so far.",

It is exactly at the corner of new bridge road and upper circular road. Very crowded in the evenings. They a pretty good variety of different parts that you can have in your soup. You have the usual ribs , tenderloin, or offal like liver, kidneys, stomach. As I am usually too lazy to remove the bones from the ribs, i usually get the tenderloin mixed with stomachThey also do a pretty decent braised intestine, if you feel like it. the soup is light and delicate, which is good if you do do not want something very over powering.",
