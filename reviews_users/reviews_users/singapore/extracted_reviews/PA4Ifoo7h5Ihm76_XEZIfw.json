While there're so many new Thai places that sprout up around the city, I love being able to head to a reliable place like this & know I'll have a tasty meal always! Especially as I love actual spicy Thai food with bite. The lunch sets are solid and come with drinks like lime juice. My favorites are tom yum soup noodles, beef noodles soup (very fragrant soup), pineapple rice set which comes with green curry and pandan chicken and a few other sides, green curry. The basil chicken is popular & it uses actual chili padi & packs a punch!This place also gives me the feels because it's a very popular RI/RJ haunt, and I've come countless times with different groups of friends. It's a very casual feel with no frills decor, but always clean. I also frequently visited the purvis street location last summer as it was close to my internship, and discovered other great dishes like mango sticky rice, papaya salad, omelette, pandan chicken and so on. Never disappoints!",

The restaurant is tucked in a really quiet neighborhood but I drive, so its easy for me :D Parking isn't too hard to find given if the residents are giving people. There's always a crowd for sunday evenings, even for an area like clover way.The food is great, all of it. And the price is too! Only thing that i found expensive were the drinks. Thai milk tea at $2.50, not so cheap. \u00a0The restaurant floor is run by just 2 guys whom will seat you down, take orders and serve them. Just 2 only but no complains, service is decent and efficient if i might say. Only accepts cash payment only. So always check your wallet before ordering away on those irresistible yummies!",

    "text": "Nicely located within my parents neighborhood, I've seen this Thai eatery grow from here since its humble beginnings to a brand name with other outlets across the island. They have maintained the same menu and budget prices that have helped then build a loyal following. Almost everything on their menu is value for money. Whether you're eating solo or treating your family, you feel you've got your money's worth. That's why the only accept cash. I've eaten their awesome beef noodles since they opened shop and it tastes the same today as it did the day they opened. Same robust recipe that build them a reputation. And it still costs $5. For the robust flavor and chunks of beef brisket you get, this is good food at a great price.Come early or call to make a reservation. Otherwise you'll have to wait, especially on weekends. Take note of their opening hours because they only open for lunch and then they close until opening for dinner again. They take those rest hours for rest and prep time before their dinner crowd. Weekdays 11am-3pm, then 6pm-9pmWeekends 11am-3pm then 6pm-10pmTel: 62580228",

    "text": "We finally found the time to search for Jai Thai since moving into the neighborhood recently. On Google maps it looks like there should be a short cut rather than having to get to Junction 8 first and \"hiking\" into the little enclave of Clover Way. Anyway, enough of the Bear Grylls stuff, Jai Thai is situated in a nondescript row of modern shophouses book ended by two coffee shops. It's nothing fancy inside, brightly lit with cheaper furniture, but this place isn't about the decor, it's about the food. You shutdown with a menu, pencil and paper and order from the large two sided menu. When ordering from a Thai restaurant for the first time, my theory is that you have to order Tom Yum seafood soup and Green Curry Chicken in order to do a true comparison. This we did accompanied by beansprouts stir fried with salted fish and chicken with holy basil. For drinks we ordered a Thai Chendol \u00a0and a Thai iced tea. Service was swift and we settled in for a great meal. The Tom Yum did not have the coloring you see in many restaurants, but was very spicy. The seafood consisted of Octopus, fried fish and prawns, and the ratio of seafood to soup was very generous. Did I mention it was spicy? \u00a0The green curry was delicious. \u00a0Thick, creamy with a flavor of coconut and very spicy also. Generous chunks of chicken with this vegetables I never remember the name of, but you only see in a Thai green curry. The bean sprouts were crunchy and flavorful, and while unable to vouch for the holiness of the basil, the chicken with holy basil was a delightfully spicy dish. For sure, all dishes were spicy, but hey, it's a Thai restaurant right? \u00a0It was also easy to avoid the devilish little chili padi if you wanted to. The drinks were enough to cool down any mouths on fire. Prices were very reasonable and we will certainly be returning. Now if only we could find that short cut.",

The only plus point is there is no queue and the food is served swiftly. Personally, I rather queue in nakorn rather then eating here. Don't waste your time if you don't have a car.",

That should say a bit about the food there :)Because it's not as easily accessible (although near enough to walk from Marymount), the queues here are not crazily long as Nakorn's. That said, don't expect it to be empty. I have been there all sorts of time and never once see it empty.The food is affordable and helps me miss home a bit less. I'm tempted to say that everything is nice here, but that won't be too helpful. My usual orders here include: fried fish dish with thai sauce, chicken and basil leaves, and Thai iced tea.",

    "text": "Amazing prices for great Thai food. The food is affordable enough for me to spot a few tables of students from a nearby school.I was here for a late lunch and thankfully it wasn't crowded at all. The set lunches are great value, you get a drink (lime juice/etc) and a dessert (tapioca! yeah!) \u00a0in addition to your main course. The thai beef noodles were really good if you are in the mood for something light and soupy. The broth is sweet and flavorful and not too oily. And the noodles is actually the thin rice noodles, the kind they use in pad thai. Very good.The pad thai is sweet, as in most pad thai. Not the best I've had but definitely better than average. The shrimps that comes with it were large and succulent and very fresh.Pandan chicken is a great side dish. Only $2 per piece, and it is not chicken breast! woohoo!Great little find in a otherwise-filled-with-factory-canteen neighborhood. \u00a0Plus free parking if you can find a spot around the area.",

    "text": "I'm trying to think of reasons why I shouldn't give Jai Thai 5 stars... and there are only three I can think of: First, that they don't serve alcohol. How great would a beer be with that spicy green mango salad? Oh, and second: if Jai Thai delivered, I would positively be in HEAVEN. Thirdly: Jai Thai is cash only. Booooo for those nights I haven't had time to stop at the ATM on the way home from work. So, really, Jai Thai is nearrrrrly at 5 stars for me, but what they do have is crazy good. It's true what's been said before -- the value for money here is second to none. The sign outside their door is correct: Wallet Friendly Authentic Thai Cuisine. I've spent a lot of time in Thailand -- this is the real deal, yo. They have plenty of dishes for diets of all kinds, including vegetarians, and so far everything I've tried has been teh awsum. My current favorites are the broccoli with prawn, the aforementioned green mango salad, any/all of the squid dishes, and HELLZ YAH TO THE FISH CAKES. The prawn cakes are good too, but the fish cakes are wayyyyyyy mo bettah. You will be so missing out if you don't order these, trust me trust me trust me. They have several set menus which are also great value, particularly for lunch or for larger parties. Thai iced tea is sweet and plentiful, and service is swift and friendly. What's not to love? Erhm, maybe the industrial fluorescent lighting is a bit... difficult. They don't get points for atmosphere. But you'll be so involved in what you're eating that I doubt it'll stop you from returning...",

Given the relatively cheap price of this, we were very impressed with the quality.Another notable dish that we had was the tom yum soup with prawns, which was also fantastic. The tom yum soup was not excessively spicy, and the seafood found within was really fresh.Overall, this is definitely a must-visit place if you're on the prowl for affordable and delicious Thai food.",

I lived in the area for 2 years, but it was not till my friend told me about it that I actually walked over. They have a green curry set and beef noodle set for less than 7 dollars, and it comes with a drink as well as a dessert (usually konniyaku jelly). The olive rice sets/rice sets come with portions of chicken/green curry and more - so if you intend to try their specialties, go for it as you can try a bit of everything in bite sized protions - the best thing is that is less than 10 dollars. Do also try the Thai iced tea that comes with crushed ice and the milk tea is not too sweet - it is slightly more orange than normal iced teas though and it's an interesting blend. The ruby chendol - is also really delicious and the red bits are slightly crunch + juicy - it is a great mixed with the coconut milk.",
