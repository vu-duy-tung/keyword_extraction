The wait staff was awful, which is why I would have to give this place lower stars, I wish I can say they were typical Asian wait staff but they were extra rude and slow - very bad service.",

We even got charged for the napkins and the nasty boiled peanuts. At least have the decency to give us the two full crabs we paid for!!!

I would recommend to get the bread to help you sop up that sauce and even a rice dish. We got a salted cod fried rice and a morning glory dish between two people. The crab is a ton of food and gluttony for the two of us but it was absolutely delicious. It was difficult to walk afterwards but well worth it! The service was nothing special - a typical fast paced Chinese restaurant with your typical old school chinese restaurant decor. Located in a very touristy central area so it's nice that there is lots to do after you finish dinner in the area.",

    "text": "You know things are going to roll downhill when the waitress tells you the only crabs available are Irish brown crabs; this is after we've arrived at the restaurant at 6.45pm, imagine we had a later booking. Maybe they sold out all the Sri Lankan crabs by lunch time or maybe I look like a tourist and don't know any better. It only gets worse when she tells you that the only way to get both Chilli crab & the Pepper crab is to order the Alaskan King crab at $200 /kg with a minimum size of 2kg. Are you kidding me? As we had guests from out of town and they had heard the must try dish for Singapore was Chilli Crab, we persevered. Although I never heard of out 'national' dish known as Singapore Chili Alaskan King crab. We skipped the White Pepper option and stuck with the Brown crab, hoping other dishes could make up for the rest of the meal. Next, add the cereal prawns de-shelled please. But our request was denied as she said the restaurant doesn't de-shell the regular prawns. We would need to order King prawns if we wanted them de-shelled. Seriously?There's really very little else worth reviewing after this. The Chilli Crab had hardly any meat. We paid $128 for lots of egg and chilli sauce. The King Prawns weren't de-shelled. All 6 dishes we ordered arrived within 10 minutes from start to finish. It's as if the cooking staff just wanted to get everything out as fast as they could. Later when we ordered more fried mantou, since we had so much sauce, they arrived a minute after ordering, barely warm and definitely not just fried. Someone is making these in big batches and leaving them in a tray until someone orders them. The final straw came when we found out the price for coconuts. They were $9.90 each and that was hard to swallow. Maybe this is a tourist trap. If you venture to this establishment, be prepared to be taken advantage of. It is their cash cow and they are prepared to milk you for as much as they can get away with. You've been warned. This is a tourist trap.",

As I walked in there was no warm welcome since it seems like they had just opened. It took a while to get seated and while we were the only customer there the service was very slow. The lady that took our order was somewhat rude and was not helpful. The fried rice we ordered was not at all good, I manage to only eat a couple bites and had to leave it. The chili crab itself was really expensive (about ~$100) and was not good at all which left a sour taste of how hyped it is. We did not get much attention from the workers while a later party came in and was warmly welcomed and had exchanged conversation and laughter. It definitely wasn't the most pleasant experience I had but would definitely not come back nor recommend to anyone else.",

    "text": "Summary:Food was decent but expensive, service was OK. It looked like it may have been a much nicer place when it first opened then it is currently.Details:The food is decent but certainly not amazing. We went here because my friend who was visiting really wanted Chili Crab and a local resident friend recommended this restaurant though maybe she meant a different location.We had the tasting menu for $199 for 2 pax which is reasonable for the quantity of food (if you just orders chili crab it would be the price of the tasting menu)The service staff is very passive, rarely explaining what things are when serving and serves the food whenever it's done rather than asking if you'd like to proceed to the next course.Food wise nothing is remarkable but nothing was bad either. Shark fin soup was ok, wok fried greens good, chili crab good, dessert jelly OK, bread (extra charge was awesome and worth it), lobster salad was ok they really overdo the mayonnaise dressing which is a shame because the lobster was pretty good. Also the presentation on the ex lobster salad was fantastic Also ordered Ice lemon tea but it came without a lemon slice or sugar syrup which seemed odd.The previous reviewer is correct they will bring you a small portion of peanuts without asking then charge you for it. Additionally they may bring you those pre-moistened wipes without you requesting and charge you for those too also without telling you. I don't mind the money but it seems rather petty to charge high prices, set stuff on your table without asking you and then charging you for it without telling you. The place also seems odd in the fact that they use low quality paper napkins on the tables, mismatched china wear and the upkeep isn't all there (the booth we were sat in had damage too it an a large piece of tape highlighting the damage. The place wasn't busy they could have easily sat us elsewhere.Lastly they have about 5 songs on a loop, they play over and over again in the same order it seems so you will hear the same song 2-3 times.I definitely wouldn't go back the market here is far too competitive with seemingly limitless options.",

The food is always consistently good here and much more reasonably priced compared to say palm beach seafood a stone's throw away at one Fullerton. Granted service can be a bit erratic when the place is packed on weekends but it is my go to for quick dinners before and after performances at esplanade because the dishes always arrive promptly and they're often delicious. The signature homemade bean curd is the bomb - there's an extra flourish to it cos they add deepfried dried prawns which gives each bite a little umami burst of saltiness. The spinach in broth is good too with a very tasty stock. Among the other zichar staples to order are the salted fish fried rice and coffee pork ribs. And the bill won't give you sticker shock (if you don't order pricey seasonal seafood lah). I've had wonderful filling dinners here at between $25 - $40 a head. This place is a classic lah. Haven't forgotten its neighbourhood roots despite the posh setting.",

I'm annoyed that they didn't have the Sri Lankan crab, which is what we usually order since it's much cheaper than the Dungeness or Swedish crabs. They never seem to have it in stock, and the waitress gave me such an attitude when I asked when they would have it again. She told us they had it just the other day and that the restaurant wouldn't know when the supplier would deliver it again. What kind of restaurant does keep track of when their ingredients would come? Dumb. She just didn't want to deal to with my questions and her annoyance was obvious. They also tried to charge us for tea and when I said we didn't order it, the waiter (we had different waiters with each interaction) doubted me and he didn't apologize until he made complete sure that we didn't try to rip him off for the 7$ tea... As if. I think the crab makes up for it tho since I loved it so much. We also got prawns and they were alright but I wouldn't come back for them.",

    "text": "No signboard chain is good in general, but this one probably has the worst rep out of all. \u00a0We usually come here when bringing guests from other countries due to its perfect location in Esplanade with beautiful views of both Marina bay sands and Fullerton hotels. If you look like an expat, or look like you are with clients, or you just look easily deceivable in general, beware and be warned. You will order a crab dish and get charged $1000 (including GST and service charge) while the Singaporean locals sitting beside you get charged $100. \u00a0When you order chilli crab, one of the main dishes to get here, they will ask if you'd like an Alaskan one (and not the typical sri lankan one) without quoting the price. the menu shows no price but a mere \"market price\" statement. The difference between the two is that Alaskan crab comes out to about $600 per dish, while the Sri Lankan crab comes out to approx. $50~80. If there is this much price difference between the two, i think a moral restaurant would and should state the price when asking a customer whether they want the \"other (expensive) kind.\" However, on the few times I came here with a company, I realized the waiter actually avoided in answering (or acting like he didn't hear) our question on how much per g an Alaskan crab it is and hoped that the \"stupid rich expat\" would just nod and agree away on ordering Alaskan.We've tried both Alaksan and Sri Lankan due to companies many times not being able to forthright ask its price in front of clients, and there really really isn't much difference in taste to warrant the $900 difference. \u00a0No signboard, you're so rich already. Get your morals straight and stop acting like a restaurant in a third world country ripping off your own customers.",

    "text": "Among all the big chili crabs places, No Signboard was my favorite. Emphasis on the \"WAS\" because I think they deliberately offer the Alaskan Snow crabs without telling you that it is 3x more expensive. Our usual bill in this restaurant is $35-50 per head depending how big the group. Last year, I was entertaining some tourists and suggested the place. They went and (ordered) ahead of me -- I just told them to order the chili crabs and white pepper crabs. We were shocked when our bill came and it was $1500+ for 10 pax. When we checked the bill, the Alaskan Snow crabs was the reason. I was told that the waitress said that the usual crabs were not available so they offered the Snow crabs --- without mentioning that they were 3x the price.Last Tuesday, I was back there for a team business dinner and my Chinese-speaking officemates ordered -- so I couldn't make what they were ordering. When my boss got the bill, it was $2400 for 16 pax --- and again it was because of the Snow crabs. Don't get me wrong, I'm ok spending $150 for a meal IF its worth it. I can get very good chili crabs in other restaurants at $30 without feeling duped.",
