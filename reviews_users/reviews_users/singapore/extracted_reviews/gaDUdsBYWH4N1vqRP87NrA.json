The portion was perfect for me and the veggies were grilled perfectly. It was totally worthy of the 'gram! ;)A great spot in Novena for your healthy fix!",

    "text": "I have been loving this healthy vegan cafe on my week in Singapore for work. It's always good to balance your food indulgences in Singapore with a few healthy options thrown in there.I have tried their classic green salad and also the quinoa patty, both were great, the salad dressing was outstanding, I even asked for the recipe! Their food menu is insanely long; pizza, pasta, stuffed capsicum, salads and so much more. They have a list of juices and coffees, though I found the juices to be very expensive compared to other juice prices in Singapore.There's plenty of seating, even when there is a long line at the counter. I'll be back!",

My aunt ordered the mushroom pene pasta (with cheese) dry and tasteless too. So disappointed! So expensive too!!! ?!?! I'm better off with microwaved TV dinner food. =.=''Way overpriced, I mean there's a juice bar one step away, it sells fresh juice for $3.50 a 16oz cup, real foods sells juice for $8 and up, for a 8-12oz volume. ?!?!?! Epic fail. 0/5 if it's an option.Just look at the pictures others posted.(I Should've checked Yelp reviews before dropping in.)",

At the seating area itself, they have shelves and shelves of books for folks to read while enjoying their meals.I found their food quite nice as vegetarian food is not easy to achieve full flavour. I personally won't eat here again unless a treat is given!",

First, because of the fact that it's healthy. 2nd, they prepare the food just right after you order (so, you have to wait). 3rd, it suits my taste. My favorite so far is their pancake. That's when I realized that eating healthy can be so delicious. Me and friends always order this for sharing. So there, eat healthy y'all. :)",

I really enjoy the purist, REAL taste of the food: there's very little use of sauces and spices, so you can enjoy that real taste of the pasta, the omelette, the tomato,... you name it! My favorite is their Spinach Arrabiata Whole Wheat Penne topped with feta cheese.The best thing is that whatever you eat here, you don't feel the post-lunch food coma! The only real drawback is the location: surrounded by a number of other take-away food places, and with no real enclosure, this place feels a little too noisy for a quiet lunch.",

    "text": "This place reminded me a lot of Ruggles Green in Houston. You walk in and they offer a variety of different organic items including kale chips, tortilla chips, nuts, chocolate bars and more for sale at the counter. The menu looks very vegan-friendly, but Paleo folks will still have a limited selection. It's still do-able, though. What lured us in was the brown rice milk ice cream. Yup, it's a cheat - we know...but we so rarely get ice cream and have surprisingly struggled to find coconut ice cream in Singapore...that we caved. Must have been the \"Cave\"man Food we had next door just beforehand. :)We had a fairly substantial wait at the counter - the employee was busy juicing and didn't even bother to turn around to address or greet us until we politely coughed to get his attention. Then he merely told us and another woman that had also walked in to hang on. We finally ordered the dark chocolate to share and it was creamy and just the right consistency. It disappeared quickly! They were also offering strawberry, hazelnut chocolate and a few others. We might have to try out something new if our will power gets the best of us again! :)",
