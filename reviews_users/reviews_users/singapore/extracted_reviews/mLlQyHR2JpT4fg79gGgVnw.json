Easy access, short distances to other party places, nice views of the river and the surrounding neons. The selection of food is decent, and the quality above average. The prices may be above avergae but we are paying for the venue too.Service is prompt and attentive. The weather is nice and breezy in the evening. Not too quiet, just enough buzz and allows us to carry decent conversations.Nice chillaxing place.",

    "text": "I've been coming here for at least 4 years...mainly for the beers. I think Sque has the most reasonable selection of commercially brewed beers available on Clarke Quay. It's a combination of inside (no views) outside (great views of river and passing trade) seating. Staff are friendly. Service is quick. Food quality has improved...Recently had a Nicoise salad for lunch...it was fantastic. Whole seared slices of tuna, not canned tuna flakes, with all the necessary ingredients like boiled egg, anchovies, red onion slices, tomatoes, cos lettuce. Highly recommended for happy hour visitations as well. Would give 5 stars but their public toilet facilities are quite a distance away.",

Steak was nicely done, and the ribs were particularly good. Yummy sauce and meat was tender.Also had chicken wings that you should know was basically har cheong gai. But good!Also had fried chicken skins which was as fried and as crispy as it could be and did its job - which is to make my beer go down easier. 1 for 1 beer at lunch!Why people so harsh? :D This place has nice food and beer, what.Oh, service was excellent too!",

    "text": "1. Affordable drinks - The only bar along the clark quay stretch that has 1for1 alcohol all night long (till 11pm) on weekends :) yay!!! Other bars usually close their drinks promo by 8-830pm. 2. Unlike most bars, they have real food instead of just bar food. - The dessert was pretty decent :) - Probably because they are a restaurant as well.3. Great service! despite our party being huge (20pax+++) \u00a0and constantly moving around/mingling and changing seats, the waiter knew exactly what everyone ordered and served each person his/her correct bill. Very impressed.The person I spoke to was also very accommodating to our big group, suggestion menu choices, drinks etc. Emailing me personally. Other bars I checked out, Harry's, Cafe iguana along the same Clark Quay stretch weren't as efficient or helpful. Cafe iguana was probably the worst! I practically had to chase down the manger to get a quote on food etc. 4. Good view of the Singapore river. 5. Also, not too noisy, dark or smokey like other bars. - Perfect for having a conversation with friends or networking while enjoying your drink at the same time. I didn't have to shout into my friends' ears to be heard.",

    "text": "It is extremely unfortunate that my experience with this place has been less than exceptional on the one visit that I have been here since I started using Yelp. I visited SQUE for the first time about 2 years ago, for Restaurant Week and both the service and food was extremely commendable. Since then, I have become a semi-regular here because of their amazing Happy Hour deals (from 5pm - 7pm and then 9pm - 11pm, that's definitely my tip for coming here). I have been very fortunate to have been served for the same lady the last 2 years, perhaps it was by coincidence that she is always here when I visit.However, on today's visit she was not one of those who were on duty and I can definitely say that the service here is less than exceptional. I was here for first drinks with my girlfs after dinner nearby and stayed after they left to have drinks with the boyf who came for dinner / to send me home. While here with the girls, it took us 10mins to try and get the attention of the waiter just to order our drinks - which in all honesty is not great when you have about 5 - 6 waiters around. SQUE is not an exceptional huge place, and I don't expect this to happen because I have always been served under 5mins in my previous visits. Perhaps you could say that I have been pampered by my precious waiters here, but I would expect some level of service at least when it is a lull period. The boyf came at 9:20 while my girlfs left at about 9:30 - and while I would think that the place was a bit more crowded than an hour plus before, most of the tables had already been served. He ordered a soup and pizza, and while the pizza did not come until 9:40 which I would say is understandable but, the soup had not arrived. We decided to cancel the soup order since appetizer had not arrived before the main course and we were denied that cancellation. Their reason - the soup and pizza are done in different ways and that our soup was being prepared. While I understand that, I really don't think that a soup that has been pre-prepared and reheated would take 35mins to come. Even making the mushroom soup from scratch would have taken less time than that! The soup was extremely salty and didn't seem like a freshly made soup at all. The bread that came along with the soup had dark black toast burn marks, but it was still soft as if it wasn't toasted at all. This was DEFINITELY NOT a dish that would have taken 35mins to make. I wouldn't recommend coming here for food, and definitely not for drinks outside Happy Hours. The service here is below expectations (compared to my expectations of other restaurants and not with my previous visits to SQUE itself because I think that would be unfair - probably that waitress that usually serves is was one of the best here) and unless you're prepared for slow service, I would recommend heading to Clarke Quay and its myriad of better restaurants.",

As the one poor person who ordered food here, let me give you a stern warning. Absolutely, do not order any food. Only go for the double-priced 2-for-1 happy hour drinks. We ordered a burger and wings. The burger was served completely raw, while the wings were dripping with frozen ice water and had blood near the bones. Beware!",

Actually, the billboard displays of their dishes don't really do their food justice. The Soup of the Day I had (Pumpkin) was average but the Tomato & Mozzarella Salad with Tuna was very good. I was pleasantly surprised, I admit. The riverside location with people and boats going by makes a very relaxing lunchtime atmosphere. The sandwiches I saw being served to other diners look great too.",

The quesadilla was much better than the awful one I had at Chili's. But we are here only for the drinks. yeah to happy hours. The place is also rather big and thus, we never had much issue finding a table. Small AC area only, but do sit outdoors, you get a nice view of the Singapore river facing Clarke Quay.",

    "text": "I haven't eaten there, so I am basing this review on the bar. Specifically, on the fact that they have hundreds of different beers to choose from. Ask them for the full beer menu if they don't offer it initially. There are lots of craft beer from around the world to choose from, although I'd like to see more more American beers. Of course, the extensive list has it's drawbacks. They apparently run out of popular beers often, because I walked away disappointed on two different occasions when they didn't have any Stone IPA. And you will pay a premium for the variety and the location. It is just steps away from the Clarke Quay MRT, right on the river.Update: \u00a0I finally tried the food and was pleasantly surprised. The roasted chicken sandwich was great. Juicy and flavorful with fresh, crispy wedge fries. The happy hour really takes the bite out of the prices. Two-for-one draft beer after 9:00, and half price bottles after 10.",
