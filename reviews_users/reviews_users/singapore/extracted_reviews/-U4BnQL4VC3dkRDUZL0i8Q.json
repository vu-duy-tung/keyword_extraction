A good friend of mine is a fan, and has been coming here and raving about their dimsum for ages, so it was only natural that we would end up coming here eventually.Apparently queues are a common sight to behold but we were here at 10pm on a weekday night and there was none!Loved their steamed custard buns, xiao long bao and chao shou (Sichuan wontons in chili oil). The custard buns came at just the right temperature, and were packed with the divine yellow gravy which was viscous and oozed out just barely as we bit into it. (In comparison to a recent version at another shop where it was so watery and hot that the both of us got scalded). They were generous with the meat in the xiao long bao, and it was flavorful and I'd dare say comparable to the ones at Crystal Jade. Would have had more of this if not for the limited stomach space!The chao shou came lying in a very tasty chili oil mix and were more spicy than other ones I've tried. It was good but could have been better. It came in a shallow dish, making it quite difficult to scoop up sufficient amounts of the chili oil to go with my wontons. Would have preferred to ladle some more into my spoon for that additional kick as I was eating it. Perhaps next time I'll ask for some extra oil on the side. Dessert was mehhhh. Had the yang zhi gan lu (mango/pomelo dessert) and I've had better.Dinner came up to be about $25 for 2! Affordable and good- I'm definitely going to return someday!",

    "text": "Swee choon's an OK place for late night supper with friends or family. Although the dim sum variety here is extensive, I feel that taste-wise, it isn't as good as other dim sum supper places like Crystal Jade at Holland Village. Their staff service is pretty bad too. One of the waiters got pretty pissed and went away in a huff when we asked for our drinks to be served after ~10 mins of waiting. I'd say a good place to hangout for dinner/ supper/ early breakfast if you are just looking to fill your tummy. Do not try: pumpkin pastry (see picture)Do try: fried carrot cake",

I don't think their dim sum is anything special, despite the name, but their northern-style dumplings and hand-made noodles are very good. \u00a0For me, the star dish is their spicy chili wontons. The dumpling skins are thin and silky, they're generously filled with juicy pork, and the sauce is a perfect mix of black vinegar, soy, and chili. Also, there's this one waiter who runs around the place like a madman, yelling \"Beep! Beep!\" to let people know he's coming through. \u00a0Even when there's no one in his way.",

    "text": "I first started going to Sweechoon Timsum back in 2010. Three years has passed and this restaurant is one of my favourite go-to places for late night supper and dimsum cravings.Some of my favourite dishes include:1) Salted egg yolk custard bun- I don't think this needs much introduction. The bun is small but full of goodness.2) Beancurd skin prawn roll- I love how they deep fry the beancurd skin with fresh shrimps and minced meat. But this dish is seriously one of their most inconsistent dishes; some days it's served cold and soggy... I guess one can only hope for the good days.3) Spicy chili wanton- Nice and soft wantons in a spicy vinegar sauce, what's there not to love?4) Mee sua kueh- This exclusive Sweechoon dish has mostly mixed reviews with some thinking it's too bland, but I LOVE the texture and crispiness of the kueh.. It's like fried carrot cake but better!Food aside, it is good to see that their business has improved tremendously throughout the years, but it is depressing that the queues have gotten ridiculously long as a result. My most recent trip there last Friday saw me waiting in line for more than 45mins before I got a table. While the food may be relatively cheap and good, I can no longer justify traveling all the way down to Jalan Besar and then waiting another 1h before I can have my food. Guess I'll be on the lookout for other supper alternatives.",

One of the few places to be open past 3am, it's quite common to see long queues and full houses on Wednesdays and throughout the weekend. In fact, its more of a nightspot than other usual tim sum places that open in the morning (they close at 10am!). The service staff are attentive and quick, and food is served within 10minutes of ordering, regardless of the crowd. Decor is kept relatively simple and tables are well spaced, allowing for comfort while eating, though it can get a little noisy. So far, the fried mee suah, liu sha bao, prawn rolls and chee cheong fun are the dishes that I find myself repeating whenever I'm there.",

Along the street was where I found Swee Choon Tim Sum; brightly lit signboards on the outside + huge crowds of patrons queuing outside = definite must try!My favorite's the golden tofu cubes top with a little pork floss, these are to die for! Their soup dumplings and pan-fried dumplings are my bf's favorites. If you are a congee lover, you won't want to miss SC's century egg congee. Yummmm!If you hate queuing, here's a good hack: go behind the restaurant and volunteer to sit at the back alley. You get good food fast and sitting in the back alley gives a more casual feel to the dim sum experience.Opening hours are weird here, they open everyday (except tues) from 6pm until 10am. Fantastic for the owls in you.",

I love their Har Gao (prawn shrimp dumpling - comes in pairs) as well as their custard buns - which comes in thress. Their chee cheong fun is smooth and thin, not the typical machine processed kind which is laden with flour. Do not forget to try their special fried red bean pancake. They also serve mango sago dessert, and a plethora of drinks such as barley, ice grass jelly and more. For a group of four, if you eat to your fill, it probably will cost about $10 per pax.",

That's not putting the place done, I just have had better dim sum in other parts of Singapore and even in Melbourne. There's always a queue out the front, but walk through the store and sit out the back is your best bet for a table. While you go without aircon, and any real artificial light, it adds to that real SE Asia dining feel. Be warned though, if you don't like rates or mice I'd give the back tables a skip, as they will often be running around the gutters and under tables in the dark!!! Food is decent while not spectacularly good, extensive choices is a plus, drunken chicken is fantastic!! \u00a0Good place to hang out for late night dim sum!",

There were some new items on the menu that i never saw before like the fried mee sua which tastes rather interesting but it was really delicious at the same time, who would have thought of fried mee sua wrapped around some carrot cake.There were other usual dim sum items like the black bean pork ribs, char siew buns and siew mai. All were pretty good but the price however came up to about $30+ per pax so be prepared for that. I will still go back nonetheless for their quality of dim sum.",

This place is seriously looked like a doctor place, bunch of people waiting on the road side sitting on the plastic chair staring at the electronic ticker praying that their numbers to be called next. I was surprised that the line was long when finding parking in this area should also be a separate challenge. Can't really miss this place on Jln Besar since the shop almost occupies the entire block. Go to the podium outside to get a number by telling how many in your party, wait while filling in your order in the form by looking at the big ass laminated menu sampler (not all the things are shown there), hurry back to the podium when your number is shown on the ticker, sit on whatever table the bouncer tell you to, press the bell on the wall when you're ready to order (be warn that nobody gonna ask you about the order unless you do that - I sat for 5 minutes getting confused why nobody came around to ask), and enjoy the fast service, cheap and good dim sum! By cheap I really meant it, I pay just above SGD 20 for 6 items and 2 drinks - it's been a while to find a dim sum place so popular but so cheap in Singapore. Tried the chicken feet, fried shrimp dumpling, fried shrimp in tofu skin, xiao long bao, mixed veggie, and siu mai. Portions are small (most items only has 2 pieces on them) but they didn't skim on the meat - the fried dumpling and tofu skin were pretty packed with shrimp. The veggie looked liked blah when I 1st saw it (we ordered it since it's the only veggie item available on the list), but it was surprisingly tasty and good!",

I came in with around 12 people and were accommodated very nicely - we played games, we ate good food, what more is there to love? ALSO - THE MOST CRUCIAL POINT.Up to that very moment in time I was convinced that red bean wasn't for me. After tucking into their red bean pancakes (and tuck in I did) I literally made a 180 degree turn and now can't get enough of red bean desserts! They are so so delicious, we had to order more! I would go back just for that. In fact I'm planning to make a massive trip with my sister and cousins the next time I am over.Looking forward to it already!",

Although there are some good competition around the area (Da Lian noodles across the street and Tim Ho Wan at lavender and both opens 24 hours), Swee Choon definitely has their own following. My favorite is also the fried mee suah, which most yelpers has pointed out. I have never seen this dish anywhere else. Savory rice noodles pan fried. It is certainly interesting.Everything else on the menu you can probably find a better version elsewhere.",

The dishes tasted almost flawless and is honestly one of the best dim sum around Singapore! The only downside is the price and the seating. The prices are quite expensive and the seating is quite limited due to the crowd. Highly recommend! Xiao long bao- 9.5/10",

    "text": "This was my first visit to this place and as a tourist to this country I think Swee Choon Tim sums are the best. Their menu is so different and the food comes to your table piping hot. It's fresh and so authentic that if I were to live in Singapore, I'd visit this place every fortnight. I was very luck to have been taken to this place by two locals and they showed me exactly how to eat each dish. As you all know dim sums are better enjoyed in a bigger group, so one can try more varieties. However if you are visiting Singapore and are clueless about which place to eat dim sums at, look no further. At peak hrs this place does get crowded and wait times can go upto about an hour or so.",

I wasn't all too impressed with the food the first time i went and i was glad that i returned with my food kakis after a long hiatus. Since every dish was pretty small, that allowed us to order up a storm even at 3 in the morning. Oh and this was after i had my Peanut Butter French toast and Hazelnut latte at midnight. We had the Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun (3 for $3.60) which wasn't all too bad. I liked the Sichuan Chili Oil Wanton (4 for $4) which had the right amount of spice and vinegar. The Steamed Pork Ribs ($2.50) were also tender and well marinated. I rather liked the pan fried carrot cake (2 pieces for $2) that had the right chunks of radish and dried shrimps. No Chee Cheong Fun for me because it is the regular kind and not the steamed Cantonese sort. Yes i'm picky that way.You MUST order the Fried Golden Tofu ($3.50) that is lightly crusted on the outside and seasoned with pepper and salt. The silky texture is simply amazing. The steamed beancurd roll in oyster sauce ($3.20) is also very good. I'll definitely be heading back if hunger pangs strike in the middle of the night!",

    "text": "It's Swee Choon Tim Sum, I dont think I need to introduce it much except the fact that it used to be just one unit, non-airconditioned and a little raw and dirty...which has it's natural draw of a very authentic chinese late night dim sum place. Though it small and slightly rundown, it was usually packed cos the food is good.Lo and behold, a few years down the road, Swee Choon Tim Sum has expanded across 3 - 4 units with 2 of them air-conditioned. Despite the expansion, it's still packed and please do not expect to get a seat straight away cos you will definitely still need to wait to get a table, it's just a matter of, how long is that waiting time.Classic dim sum menu, the hargao (steamed prawn dumplings) and siew mais (steam pork dumplings) are really not that great, but, you gotta try their Salted Yolk Custard bun. For the uninitiated, there is a way of consuming these salted yolk custard buns that will NOT cause a mess or an unexpected explosion of hot buttery custard all over you. To prevent unnecessary embarrassment, remember, you \"attack\" this heavenly bun from the bottom. Slowly peel off the paper cup base, and slowly bite into the bun. Savour each drop of creamy salted custard before taking another bite.The rave seem to all be abt this custard bun and really that's pretty much about it for me. I dunno why people flock here all the time cos the parking is terrible (not many parking lots around) and the food is only average but it still one of the few places that I will always go for late night dim sum craving. What a sucker I am!",

    "text": "I've gotta say, Swee Choon is a great place for a drunken post-party supper. Especially if you get a seat at the tables in the dark little alleyway behind the restaurant. It's so shady, it has a specific charm to it.I prefer sitting outdoors anyway. Even though there's airconditioning inside, the fluorescent lights are a pet peeve of mine, and the floors are oily. Service is curt and efficient, but don't expect a smile. They guys working here are so busy they don't have time for niceties. They shout out orders and commands into a walkie talkie, striding about busily, serving and clearing plates and taking orders at the same time. I am honestly quite impressed at their chaotic system. Somehow, it works.Be sure to come early if you're coming for dinner or an early supper. It gets pretty full up! The dimsum here is affordable and of decent quality. It is also served in small portions, so couples can come here to eat by themselves too.I especially like thei Liu Sha Bao - it's bun with some kind of custardy salted egg filling. The golden filling oozes out of the steaming bun as you bite into it. Their Char siew buns are also pretty good, with a fluffy, light bun, and tasty, meaty fillings. Another thing I like to order is the char siew pastry. The pastry is light and buttery, with sesame seeds sprinkled in top. Super tasty.The har gow and siew mais are pretty good as well, but the century egg porridge was far too bland and uninspiring. The non dim sum dishes are alright as well, so don't be too worried about ordering different things to try!Another dish that deserves special mention is the Orni (yam paste). It comes with pumpkin and gingko nuts... and it's divine! Served hot in an individual bowl, it's a generous portion for one person. It's fresh and fragrant, with a thick and consistent texture. I love that it's not too sweet as well.Love it here, will always come back for more dimsum in a dark dingy alley. Parking here is tedious business - only on the street. And this ebing Little India, people are walking around everywhere, and you also have road works to contend with. Good luck!",

The food is pretty much average. This is not the place for fine details or quality food. It is just a normal place with food which will suit most. The highlight for me, besides the opening hours, is the liu sha bao (custard bun) which is done pretty well. Eat it while it is hot and you will get the soft custard filling flowing out of the soft bun. Another dish which is not commonly found is the mee sua kueh. It is similar to fried carrot cake, except it is made of mee sua. Strands of mee sua are fried till crispy. It is good though oily. You will need to share this as the grease can make it a bit heavy on the stomach. The har cheong gai (prawn paste fried chicken wings) is pretty good too. Don't bother ordering the bean curd. It is pricey at $2 or more and is very average. You are better off having bean curd somewhere else. The other dishes we ordered are not that memorable at all.",

    "text": "This was the last stop of our 3-part brunch and by the time we arrived, we were pretty much eating for sport. We ordered a few savory and a few sweet dim sum dishes and tried our best to eat everything.The Portuguese Egg Tart was satisfying as was the Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun. Although the sweet items were good, the savory ones were just ok.I'm kind of surprised by the number of great reviews for this place. Compared to dim sum in Hong Kong or even in the US, this wasn't that impressive. Save your precious stomach space for something more special.",

    "text": "My go-to-spot for dim sum in Singapore. You can find most of your typical dim sum dishes (siew Mai, har gao, rice rolls, BBQ pork buns, etc) plus more, such as soup dumplings. You have to also try the green onion pancake, as well as the chili wontons!A filling meal for two ran us about $30 SGD, which is a steal. Only reason why I gave Swee Choon 4 stars is because the auntie at the the counter was annoyed when I told her I didn't eat the appetizers they put on the table, which we knew they were going to charge us for. If you're not going to eat the appetizers, be sure to tell the waitress to take it away or else they'll charge you for it. Aside from this, I think swee choon is great for the money if you're looking for dim sum in Singapore.",

Other things I like include:Xiao Long Bao, Egg tarts, Har Kau,...The no-nonsense efficient style of the restaurant makes me forgiving for the lack of contact between the servers and the customers and unlike at other Chinese restaurants in town, I've never been given even as much as an eye twitch that I don't speak Chinese.Love it!",

    "text": "I felt this place was like a 3.5 but I decided to push it to a 4 for a few reasons:1) Late night dim sum. There aren't a lot of choices.2) Good organised queuing system. We came around 8pm on Sunday and we actually got seats immediately despite the queue coz we were only 2 and ok to sit in the alley at the back.3) Pleasant service from the 2 or 3 different guys who served us.What I ate:1) fried garlic dou miao for 8 dollars. Worth it!2) char siew bao - love the filling, but the bao skin was a bit too chewy. Actually all their bao fillings were good! We had also the lotus bao, the custard bao (nice molten without being too liquidy ie my friend who likes custardy type and I who like molten were both quite happy)3) cheong fan - no filling but we had a craving having missed it recently at pek kio when it was closed for CNY and wow nice surprise. So soft and smooth! Looks simple but all comfort in the mouth. This was one of our favourite items.4) Xiao Long Bao - Came quickly and was surprisingly good. The skin was quite thin, lots of juices. A bit lighter and finer tasting rather than lipsmacking greasy but very tasty.5) Egg tart - yum. Smooth light texture for the filling, quite sweet though. Good sized.Tip: Do not order lemon tea unless you want the canned Seasons one. I was hoping for homemade...A few other comments:I haven't been here in many many years. There's lots of choices on the menu and also cooked dishes for variety. Streetside parking around but need to be patient. Old school tea served in a teapot with a cup that you can sterilize in the saucer of hot water. My expat friend who has lived in Singapore many years was not sure what to do with the hot water so I had to explain. Haha nice touch.",
