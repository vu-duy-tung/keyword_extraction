    "text": "This is a challenge for myself - to write a quick review in a noisy environment lol. It's a Saturday and Toast Box is enjoying full house (it enjoys brisk biz at any time of the day on any day anyways). I like Toast Box because:1. It's FAST!- there's typically a queue to order. But, the well-trained staff work very fast so you don't need to wait long to order. 2. Tasty food- I love their toasts. I often order their Otah Thick Toast (quite spicy but very flavourful) and Hebi Hiam Soft Bun sets as I'm a big fan of their Otah (spicy Fish paste) & Hebi Hiam (spicy shrimps).Their coffees and teas are good too - favourites being Kopi-C, Teh-C and Iced Gula Melaka coffee.For their lunch/dinner options, I really love their Curry Chicken Rice. At $7.20 including a drink, it's value for money. Their Nasi Lemak is also pretty good and I order that quite often. 3. Location & convenience It's situated at a very good location in i12 Mall. If you want a quick bite, this is the place to go. They process your orders and cook your food really fast. You can finish your meal in about 20min and go. Great for time-starved SG folks.It's like a kopitiam (coffee shop) but in an air-conditioned environment. So, expect lotsa noise and yes, you may be able to eavesdrop on some juicy convo from your neighbours ^^ this is not the place to go if you want peace and quiet. It's very functional with simple decor. Eat and go!Try it! It's part of the SG experience!",

Despite being air conditioned, the A/C was on the weak side making it a rough dining atmosphere...Started off with the Iced Milk Tea which was pretty watered down...It did do the trick...Kinda...The Mee Siam entree was OK. It mainly consisted of some vermicelli, a few small shrimps and a few pieces of fish cake...Nothing to write home about. There weren't too many instructions on how to use this self-service diner for foreigners...",

Milktea was darn good also.Kaya toast - thick and crusty bread but soft inside with green coconut jam spread. \u00a0Eggs 2 - half boiled runny, crack into dish, mix with dark soy sauce and white pepper, scoop to eat. \u00a0This is not my kind of eggs but hey, we are trying new things.Laska with short rice noodles. \u00a0It is average in taste.I would definitely go back to eat at Toast \u00a0Box.",

A multigrain thick piece of toast smothered in a delicious peanut butter chopped into small bites. It came with two eggs any style which I took hard boiled. The yolks were perfect and complimented the toast very well. It comes with coffee but I asked for water instead. They only have very small bottles of water which makes things very difficult when the thirst kicks in from the peanut butter toast. Not to mention it's a warm bottle of water. Overall it's a very clean establishment and the women working the service line are on point.",

Each set comes with 2 soft boiled eggs & a beverage (you can ask for coffee or milk tea, etc.) Excellent & prompt service. Great location - just about less than 5 min walking distance from Village Hotel Katong and Roxy Square. And it is next to Bread Talk - great place to browse freshly baked items for your 2nd breakfast! I highly recommend!",

    "text": "With all-day breakfast restaurants sprouting all across Singapore, it is comforting to find a trusty Toast Box caf\u00e9 at Katong where I can cozy up with a local breakfast set of kaya toast, soft-boiled eggs and tea. They also serve a whole variety of other local delights like toasts, curry chicken, laksa, mee siam, cakes and pastries. Most of their local delicacies like the Curry Chicken, Laksa and Mee Siam are popular among the locals, as the dishes carry an authentic flavor. For the younger crowd, Toast Box also offers drinks like bubble teas with pearl. For those who are keen on taking away freshly toasted buns and pastries, BreadTalk is conveniently located beside Toast Box. The ambience of the Toast Box at i12 Katong is slightly more contemporary than the regular coffee shop setting, yet bright and welcoming at the same time. Although this outlet can remain crowded all day through, it is still easy to lose yourself in a book in the corner of the shop, if you wish to have some time to yourself.",

    "text": "My, how Toast Box has grown. It really only used to be just kaya toast, eggs and a kopi or teh... but now they have a gamut of snacks including toast with peanut butter, and meat floss, no doubt since sister (and I mean BIG sister) company Bread Talk is next door, so you know where the floss idea came from.Like the other reviews talk about, there's loads more food now - think mee siam, and nasi lemak - and I've never really had the urge to try it. But don't rule it out: a hungry me will get there eventually; I'm just trying to hold out, seeing as there are plenty of other food options in the building.They still do the tehs (hot or iced) okay, just at different prices - I got a iced teh at $2 today, when I could have gone across the road and spent $1.20? Guess I'm helping to pay for street-front rent and the super cold air-con in my own little way. Just don't complain as you look over at the people sweating it out in the kopitiam, while you slurp up your posh soft-boiled eggs.",

Right at the corner, patrons of Toast Box can sit by the window and watch the busy stretch of East Coast Road and Joo Chiat, people walking by, cars driving past and all that. Besides that, however, I'm confused as to why people go there. There have stuff like mee siam and laksa. And we all know of the Katong Laksa wars - why they even try is beyond me, because you can get the real (Well, ALMOST real) laksa right across the road in a far more genuine setting. That being said, their coffee is decent and their prices reasonable considering you're getting a nice view and air conditioning, so if you're up for a pseudo-Katong experience with higher cost and less authenticity, sure go ahead. Toast Box awaits.",

I went ahead with the mee siam and to be honest, the food was all very ho hum. Nothing very spectacular about it - not too spicy, not too sour, not too delicious, not too special. Maybe it was a bad choice on my part, seeing that the name of the establishment is... well... toast.",
