I've eaten here upwards of 6 times and everything I've tasted in this place has been delightfully memorable.The owner is a gem, he remembers his customers and their orders.If you're looking for something on the healthier side opt for a salad or wrap, everything can be customized to be vegetarian or vegan. If you're looking for some yummy comfort food get the Mac n Cheese! (Comes with beef but can be made without. The owner will substitute veggies if you'd rather.)Seating inside is limited but these flavors are worth the visit!!",

The fresh ingredients definitely doesn't hurt, and the super friendly owner.Bonus point as they are never busy during dinner. For lunch it's a different story I heard!",

    "text": "Healthy, fast, with a sense of humor. What's not to like?This is a great takeaway spot if you're looking for something healthy. I wasn't in the mood for meat so I went with their veggie wrap, which had miso tofu in it.I thought that the tofu wouldn't have any taste, but wow, I was wrong! It definitely had some good spice and flavour to it. In addition to the greens, the added achar and nuts gave the wrap some good texture and an extra boost in energy.The chef (and I will assume owner) is very jovial and knows all his regular customers by name. He's good with small talk, so don't be afraid to strike up a conversation with him as he's preparing your food!",

    "text": "Lock me up and throw away the key!Dining here turned my colleague and I into petty criminals. So engrossed were we in our lunchtime rant-a-thon that we neglected to pay after eating.We only realised this fact upon returning to our office. A solid 5+ minute walk from this establishment.Once our crime-spree registered in our brains, we were both instantly wracked with full body pangs of guilt and embarrassment, quickly followed by engaging in a long walk of shame back to the eatery.Re-arriving, with guilt-ridden faces, we bowed our thieving heads in an act of ultimate contrition hoping to assuage the owner into letting us off lightly.We proffered our payment and our sincerest apologies in good faith as we looked to escape a long stint behind bars in a federal pound-me-in-the-4ss prison (thanks office space).To our delight we discovered that the owner/operator is actually Captain Cool from the ice planet Chillax. He found our tale of woe and misdemeanour hilarious and amusing and deemed our prodigal return a clear act of good faith. Restoring our smiles to our faces and the freedom to return to his fantastic little world of food again.I had the special which today was Wagyu beef, and I chose to wrap it in a shroud of wholemeal and assorted greens. The taste? Anything that tastes this good should be a crime!The price? A steal! (Actually it is quite spendy @ $16 but I would gladly pay it again).This place lives up to its name, simple and humble food done good. Just remember to pay your bill when you leave ;)",

This is my favourite place for a lunch on Circular Rd! :)The menu is short and very specific, hover almost every day they prepare meet or veggie special (falafel, hummus, special kind of meat/sea food etc.). This is more than salad and more than just a wrap. You have to check it out and the owner - Akhil - will definitely remember you and your name!",

    "text": "Meat and Green is in a small space in Boat Quay that is good for lunch. There is limited seating inside and a few street side tables in front, but it's convenient food for take-away, too. The owner, Akil, is always there making sure that everything is of high quality. The vegetables are fresh and the wraps are piled with meat. I'd recommend the pulled pork. Delicious and satisfying! They have some interesting bottled soft drinks in the cooler, and a limited selection of ciders and beer (Tuatara on the crafty side). It's pretty quiet in the evening, which makes it a good option if you are in the area and you want to find a quiet place to chill on an otherwise busy street.",
