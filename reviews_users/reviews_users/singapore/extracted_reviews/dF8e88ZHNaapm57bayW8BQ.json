They also serve laksa, other bakery (cake, brownies, etc.) and other drinks (would recommend the barley drink). The venue in MBS is very convenient for a shopping break",

It's great because it's one of few places that actually opens early...7:30am. I got the laska soup and a black tea. Both were fine for the price which was only 7.50 sgd. I wouldn't say it was anything special though. Bottom line..come for the ambience or a safe place to grab a bite or drink early in the morning. ProsIn a shopping mall in the basement so it's easy to get to Affordable Cons Food is just ok Tea is just ok",

The seating area is pretty spacious and the aunties at the counter were soooo friendly to me, which is a step up from other Toast Boxes I've been to. As usual the kaya toast was good for a quick snack and the milk tea is always refreshing.",

For a food-court type of cafe in almost all the malls, this place is not pricey, it maintains a very clean and lovely image, and the food is good.The citylink location can get quite busy at lunch (though, given my observations at raffle city, not as much). \u00a0I went there at around 1pm to grab some food and there was nowhere to sit. The people who work there were extremely friendly though, and tried to get me to wait for a bit for a seat, but I opted to get the takeout anyway.Admittedly, what attracted me there in the first place was their large sign for Laksa. I realize the danger in getting laksa in a place called Toast Box, but I was not disappointed. The laksa was creamy and flavourful, and they were not stingy on the ingredients. For $4.50, that's pretty incredible. I also really wanted to try the Kaya toast there, and for $1.40 - why not? And traditional milk tea for $1? Awesome. The kaya was really really buttery though, so if i get a chance to go back, i'd request for less butter. It was delicious, nevertheless.Thumb up!",

While I was initially skeptical as I knew it was a chain store, I loved the decor and was absolutely parched.The menu was extensive and I will forever regret not ordering the Milo toast. I'd already had kaya toast that morning though, so went with the banana cake. It was a generous size serve and fresh, light and fluffy. Just what I needed. I also ordered a delicious lemon and lime drink with tapioca pearls upon recommendation from the guy behind the counter. It was absolutely perfect, and easily some of the best pearls I've had which surprised me a lot!My partner ordered the kaya toast set with kopi and I felt happy with my choices. He said they were okay, but the kopi wasn't as great as we've previously had.",
