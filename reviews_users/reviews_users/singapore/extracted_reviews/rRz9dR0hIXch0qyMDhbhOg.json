The squid was tender and delicious, and the environment was authentic, relaxed, and perfect. My friend tried the tuna hand rolls and remarked to me that they were the best he'd ever had, and overall we had a great time.Tomo Izakaya is definitely a memorable experience, especially if you're interested in going outside your comfort zone and trying new food!",

While eating the salmon sashimi, there was a piece of hair sticking out from the wasabi. It was curly... I wanted to throw up. I flagged the waitress down and told her what I found. When she came back with the bento box, it was the same exact box that she had taken and she just put a new bowl of salmon sashimi. Talk about sanitary... I did not get an apology along with my \"new\" bento box. Wouldn't recommend this place. Food is mediocre.",

    "text": "(3 stars, but giving it 2 to compensate for the over-ratings from the other reviews)Contrary to the other reviews, I beg to differ with regards to the food quality.Food quality-wise, it's the average izakaya fare. Grilled, fried and some sushi/sashimi items to pick from on the menu. I passed on the sushi when the fish didn't look too fresh. The grilled squid was previously frozen before getting tossed on the grill, and was rather chewy. The udon was generally run of the mill. The only saving grace is the stewed pork rib.This is a place to get cheap beers, hang out and watch the world go by at the Esplanade. Service is good, and there's a variety of items on the menu. It's a notch above the regular strip-mall sushi joint. However, if you're looking for great Japanese food, this isn't the place.",

    "text": "Tomo Izakaya at Esplanade Mall is a hidden gem. The location makes for quiet dining (sorta) with a slightly more sophisticated crowd and relaxing ambience. Gyu Tataki ($13) is the beef version of sashimi. Lightly seared on the outside then marinated with lemon, vinegar and soy sauce after, it was served with pounded ginger and spring onions on top of the rare meat. Very big slices of beef which really worked our jaws. There is none of that bloodiness or heaviness of the red meat. Oishi.Skewers were next. Who could say no to BBQ bacon wrapped anything? The smokiness of the fatty pork flavored the succulent and sweet hotate chunks ($10), giving each bite a burst of juices and flavors.Shitake Mentai Cheese ($7) is a must order. The woody and juicy shitake goes perfectly with the crackling bacon and the mentaiko cream was simply the icing on the cake.The Tonkujyou Chirashi ($36) is really the highlight of the meal. The special chirashi is worth every bit of that 36 bucks even though it's a small bowl. Tomo is very generous with the fresh sashimi. The fatty toro was creamy with fats and extremely well marbled. There was so much uni and salmon roe to go around that we had to finish all the vinegar rice (which was delicious on its own too). One of the best chirashi bowls in town and reasonably priced.For reviews and more, visit my blog.",

    "text": "I decided to stop by this place with my wife after work. During a return flight to Singapore on one of the famous budget airlines, I discovered an article that listed establishments to grab cheap beer in Singapore. Now, most of us know that Singapore is an incredibly expensive place to drink alcohol. That's a fact that many of us have to live with. Well, this article stated that Tomo Izakaya had $5 beers and cheap Japanese eats. It was pretty much a must visit after reading about $5 beers. Finding this place was easy. It's close to the Esplanade, and in a great part of town, close to the river with a great view of Marina Bay and the CBD. We took a seat and really enjoyed their d\u00e9cor and setting. We ordered a couple of $5 Japanese beers and few bites which included 1) bacon scallop skewers 2) cold soba noodles 3) sushi roll 4) Seafood salad 5) chicken karage. The only thing that stood out was the skewers. Everything else was not memorable. We'd probably return for the $5 beers, but we don't plan on grabbing more food here. 3 stars for the cheap beer and the attentive service.",

    "text": "My friends and I were looking for a nice outdoor dining area and eventually ended up at Esplanade. Izakaya Tomo serves Japanese cuisine, and I'd say that you will have to try their grilled food items when you get here. We ordered the soft shell crab maki, unagi maki, bacon-wrapped vegetables, grilled squid, grilled beef, and grilled mackerel - we ended up paying about $23 per person in a party of four.Izakaya's unagi maki takes the prize, hands down. The unagi simply melts in your mouth as you bite through the firm and fresh rice ball to reach the center. The unagi is also not overly oily or slimy, so those worried about that will have less reason to hesitate ordering this dish. The soft shell crab is crispy and relatively salty (as should be expected), but not remarkable. I also wondered how difficult it would be to ruin bacon-wrapped vegetables: in any case, I loved Izakaya's version. The bacon fats are grilled nicely, with pepper bits decorating the meat at the surface.The grilled squid was a little tough and could have spent more time in the heat, but I had nothing to complain about the mackerel: thin-crisp skin combined with the succulent white flesh of the fish, tinged with freshly-squeezed lemon zest. You also can taste the smoked flavours as you savour every bite. The grilled beef - my friends concurred - was done just right: sinewy but not tough, with the temperature wavering between medium-rare and medium.Ultimately, I'd say they do their grilled food very well; and the ambience is unbeatable. The cool breeze from the waters nearby, live music in the distance, and open space so that you don't need to compete for elbow room while dining.",
