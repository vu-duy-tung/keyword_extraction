    "text": "So I was dropping off my laundry in this kind of dumpy looking building, and was intrigued by all the restaurants - especially Japanese - inside it. Wandered around a bit through the various floors and did a Google search, ended up here. Was one of the most memorable meals of a six week trip through SE Asia. It's not cheap, but the quality is quite good and there are just a ton of different types of dishes to try. Bacon wrapped scallops, wagyu beef, various pork belly preparations, beef and chicken meatballs, sausage, really there was not a single miss. We were lucky to walk in and get a table on a Thursday night, but they told us we needed to be out by a certain time. The place was packed. I would definitely recommend getting reservations.",

I've been to many a robatayaki, kushiyaki, and sumiyaki-type place and it compares favorably to a very good place in Japan. it was pretty much hard to choose a favorite menu item. The foie gras was delicately crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside. The grilled whole scallop was amazingly fresh and a symphony of flavors. Other items are the beef tongue, pork belly, chicken wings and the creamy, custard-like Japanese sweet potato. Order the sweet potato right at the beginning of your meal, as it takes a good 30-40 minutes to prepare.Ask for the off-menu seasonal items as well, and depending on what arrived that day, you might be treated to an amazing combination of dishes. A reservation is absolutely necessary as this place is completely packed. Don't let the price put you off - you get what you pay for.I usually skip Cuppage Plaza as the contents of this building are mostly pretty shady. I was reminded again as the ladies of the night congregated outside one of the numerous bars as I left the restaurant.The faint smell of barbecue still lingered on the shirt, a reminder of my visit to possibly the best place in Singapore for Japanese-style charcoal grilled items...",

This is better than at least half of the Izakaya places I have been to in Tokyo, and they speak English here which is helpful. The fish fillet wrapped in bacon was beautiful. Like pretty much all of the rest of the meal, it was juicy and flavorful.In my opinion, the shortcomings were how about half of the things we wanted to order were sold out, and then they forgot the rice we wanted (and when it came after we asked for it a second time, it was not brown rice as we had ordered but we didn't want to incur another wait by sending it back).It was about $120 and we were both full. We will return.",

Everyone seems to be thorougjly delighted by the food.The service was professional and efficient. \u00a0It was polite but not overly friendly. \u00a0Kazu seems to be \u00a0centered around getting your order and then, in a fast but relatively well paced manner, delivering your food to the table.The food was consistently very good. \u00a0It was well prepared. \u00a0There were dishes (ie Shishamo - aka pregnant fish) that I did not enjoy. \u00a0I do not think there is a way to prepare it that I would enjoy it. \u00a0I do not like the grainy texture. \u00a0The presentation was basic and very straight-forward.One person did pretty much all of our ordering. \u00a0After that, it was just a crazy culinary ride with dishes appearing in a constant stream.I am not going to comment on each dish. \u00a0I will divide them into groups and provide a link to a photo. \u00a0As you can see, by far, most things are in the \"Things I liked a lot\" section.Things I liked a lot.Pork Bellytinyurl.com/bpvol3aBacon Wrapped Oystertinyurl.com/a8uhd87Bacon Wrapped Scalloptinyurl.com/aq8ccn2Pork Wrapped Asparagustinyurl.com/b5364hfTiramisutinyurl.com/aabv2m7Dessert (Not sure what it was called but there was cocoa involved)tinyurl.com/by2myuqDessert Crepe tinyurl.com/bmbnhdsThings I liked:Beef with cheese tinyurl.com/b9z6x98I am not exactly sure what this was. \u00a0It arrived in the middle of the food maelstrom. \u00a0I tried it, thought it was ok and quickly turned my attention back to foods wrapped in bacon.tinyurl.com/b3v942yThings I didn't like:Shishamo (pregnant fish) tinyurl.com/ahzm6aaRice Soup tinyurl.com/cfsrkk3Overall - I really enjoyed the energetic vibe of the restaurant. \u00a0It is not very large. \u00a0it is full of people ordering loads of food and enjoying it. \u00a0The staff is working briskly to insure food and drink continues to flow to the table. The menu is vast but the quality of the food does not appear to be deterred by this. \u00a0Kazu Sumiyaki provided some very delicious food \u00a0 I just think this is a great dining experience.",

The place was not big and we were immediately seated at a corner and the next moment, a bowl of cabbage and special sauce was allocate to usI already conclude that this is one of the best Yakitori restaurant in Singapore when I tried the first skew. Its meatball was juicy and nicely marinated unlike the normal dried ones you find at other place.It wasn't easy to get our stomach filled since the food was really nice and one serving wasn't enough. We had garlic fried rice, pork meatball, pork maki of avocado, enoki mushroom, the seasonal squid, pork apple, foie gras which were all very good till my friend commented that they are so heavenly especially the foie gras. We had more than one serving for most of the stuff.Don't worry about the sticks laying around the table like satay stick as the restuarant provide a container at every table for those finished sticks.Ask for seasonal stuff but expect a steeper price. So, please remember to ask for the price before ordering.",

I have never been a giant fan of yakitori, but this restaurant really opened my eyes to how great yakitori can really be. Almost every item I had was outstanding, and yes I'm going to recount every item I had. The most memorable dish was an odd one, it's cold cabbage with miso dip. The cabbage was just served at the right temperature, on the cold side, and with the yummy miso sauce, the coldness and crunchiness of the cabbage really came through. We had two orders of it because it was so addictive. Foie gras skewers were great as expected, but hey it's not as challenging to make something like foie gras taste good. The garlic pork meatballs were super yummy, it was just juicy and flavorful but smoky on the outside. \u00a0The japanese tomato was sweet and yummy, and definitely try the fresh sashimi of the day. I had the best amberjack sashimi I have every had in Singapore, period. The grilled kitsune with minced pea and meat was super delicious, perfectly roasted on the outside and super umami, a must try! Bacon with enoki or avocado are really good as well. I actually wasn't as impressed with the pork belly and wagyu beef as much as I thought I would. The ONLY thing I wasn't impressed with was the bbq onigiri, which was kinda dry and salty. Ooo, and I love that their sake came in glass teapots. Not a cheap place, but definitely worth the price.",

As was the unagi kabayaki, perhaps the most tender I've had in recent memory.The kitsune - crispy beancurd skin with meat filling - was surprisingly good. It came with yellow horseradish sauce on the side, which was like a milder cousin of wasabi and went with the kitsune really well. The brown dipping sauce for the yakitori in general also complemented perfectly.Also, you are cheating yourself if you come here and don't get the yaki imo (sweet potato). Takes nearly an hour to cook but it comes piping hot and soft with a small slice of butter that just melts into the potato. We thought there were a few items that weren't worth it, though, such as the homemade fish cake at $8 and the grilled sanma (saury) at $32. The fishcake was decent but not particularly impressive. The sanma came a little too charred. Our server explained that it was because of the charcoal grill, but most of the fish skin was blackened -- not a pretty sight.",
