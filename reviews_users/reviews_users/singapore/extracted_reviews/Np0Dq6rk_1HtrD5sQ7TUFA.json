Unfortunately, aesthetics are \u00a0really all it has.Broth was really bland and watery. It had no flavor to it and no depth. Noodles were very very overcooked and noodle to broth ratio was awful (there were only a few strands of noodles). I ordered the pork belly ramen and the pork belly was okay. Cook on the soft boiled egg was not bad, either. I ordered a side of chashu to see what it \u00a0was like here and it was also bad. It was very overcooked and chewy.I'd skip this place. There are much better ramen places in Singapore. I wonder why this one is popular.",

    "text": "A Singapore Japanese Shop.Thanks to a sudden late night craving for Japanese food, we discovered this quiet Jap restaurant, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the busy Selegie Road. Well, let's get one thing straight... This isn't a Japanese Restaurant. While it serves Japanese dishes, Japanese Sake and is certainly Japanese inspired, to say that The Ramen Stall is a Japanese Restaurant is like calling Pasta Mania an Italian restaurant. To start, the menu is way.... WAAAAYY to big. While it's good to give a variety of food, the restaurant gave off the impression that A) they didn't know what to specialize in and B) that they wanted to flood you with quantity so mask the quality of their food. A glance through the menu and it's obvious. The food here was made by Singaporeans, with its flavored tweaked \u00a0and catered for Singaporeans. Chashu RamenDon't expect an authentic Japanese Ramen here. While it made a good supper noodle, the quality of the ramen was somewhere between a $4.00 packet of fresh ramen from Isetan's supermarket and a bowl of \"authentic\" ramen from Ajisan. While the noodle itself was pretty decent, the egg was way over cooked, soup tasted like it came out of a packet instead of a pork broth that the restaurant promotes it as and the chasu tasted a little too \"porky\" and little frozen.Torched Salmon SushiThis has to be the most disappointing / disturbing dish for us. A. The salmon itself probably wasn't too fresh with its flesh being a little squishy and cheewy and not at crisp as it should be.B. The rice... Omg the rice... There are 2 elements to all sushis and to get either of this two wrong would be suicide and with the fish already failing to meet the mark, nothing is worse than bad rice.Firstly, it's wet, meaning either it wasn't cooked properly, or that you had added water into the rice to keep it from drying out. Either way, sushi rice is suppose to be firm and not crumble to pieces with ever my bite. Secondly, the Mirin. Yes, Mirin is a key ingredient in sushi rice, but that doesn't mean you should flood it. All i could taste with every bite was the unbearable sweetness of the Mirin.Mixed with the squishiness of the salmon and it was truly a disaster. Even Genki sushi has better torched salmon and at a fraction of the price. (Yes, I do like Genki sushi and affectionally call it the come back kid. Will have a proper review of that soon). Kushiyaki (chicken heart, quail egg, bacon wrapped mushroom and Prawn with Mayonnaise and Roe).This had to be the saving grace of the night. The quail eggs were decent, chicken heart was a little over cooked and chewy but wasn't the worst we've had, the prawn, though a little messy as they had overloaded it with sauce, was decently fresh \u00a0and the bacon wrapped mushrooms (enoki) was by far the best dish of the night, by a mile. But than again, wrapping anything with bacon normally makes it a saving grace. Overall, while this place offered a Japanese supper alternative, it wouldn't really be missed. We'd rather curb out craving and have a proper Japanese meal the next day.",

    "text": "This place is open till 4am in the mornings. Which means it's the easy choice for late night suppers when you're not in the mood to get carbo coma from prata. The ramen is in the name, and you can pick from chicken or pork bone broth to customise your noodles. But the eatery also serves quite a decent range of yakitori and fried noodles as well as sushi and sashimi. Tip, avoid the sushi - the rice is a tad mushy. The sashimi is cheap and decent, but not startling. The bento box dinners with the yakitori stick selections are value for money. And there are a couple of nice dons - gyu and oyakudon are substantial enough even for the guys to feel happy. If not, you can always top up with a la carte side dishes of the usual Japanese varieties - karaage, edamame, grilled stuff and fried things. And those who drink will like the sturdy selection of Japanese beers and sakes. They will keep bottles for regulars. Cheap and cheerful neighbourhood eatery without any pretensions.",

Kind of... homely.It does get a little squeezy when it gets crowded but when I was there, I was surrounded by quite a few Japaanese people and it was a bit of a fun for me to pretend I was away on holiday.I like spicy food very much so I think if you're feeling adventurous and have the stomach for it, go for the Volcano ramen at the highest level of chili - I think it's 3 or 5...Good if you're in the area but in my opinion. Not really worth a long drive or queue.",

Even the sashimi i dared to try in the wee hours in the morning was surprisingly fresh and chilled and placed on crushed ice.My conclusion? Until you tell me there is somewhere more awesome than this (Jap food), I'm gonna be coming here for my sushi, ramen and sashimi fix during the hours of 12am - 5am. Enjoy.",

That's enough for me to know I'll be going back.Didn't try the ramen since we weren't that hungry, but the okonomiyaki was not bad. It was a little on the flat side, not really fluffy, but tasted fine. Prices are around the same as what you might get in town so when you factor in the late-night premium, that makes it quite worth it for a supper spot.",
