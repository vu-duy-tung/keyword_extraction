Which is to say, pop by when you're hungry and don't feel like kebab, or something a bit upmarket at other parts of the Arab St area. The menu shifts a little from breakfast to lunch to dinner, so you could eat all three meals here and not repeat a thing!",

And you get local food like the maggi goreng, horfun, fried rice, teh peng - it's a fuss free menu with equally fuss-free prices to boot.Plus you also get a good view of the Sultan mosque straight ahead as you dine al fresco on the pavement. It's usually very crowded in the evenings, a favourite supper joints of many. Also provides a good place for people watching - you might spot some Malay celebs who love to frequent the place.My usual order will either be the maggi goreng or beef hor fun, good old comfort food best served with good company!",

I'll write a more in depth review the next time I'm in town and I try the food.",

The dish came with a chicken wing, a dried fish (mackerel?), an egg, one piece of cucumber, some sambal sauce, and a heap load of rice. The chicken wing tasted old and was not thoroughly cooked. I could not taste the coconut milk and pandan leaf with the rice, as one should with nasi lemak. Overall, a sad meal that was only made slightly better washed down by the Milo Dino drink. Cheap, but you get what you pay for.",

I love the energy of this place - it's not commercial like boring Orchard Road - you can feel the energy of the people there - and when you hear the Azan from the Mosque - makes you really feel like you're in Southeast Asia.What I Love: The food and prices here are amazing. I've had the Mee Rebus here before, and it was great. It's nice to see local food here. It's hard to get nice Mee Siam at times. Their Teh-O is yummy too. A meal would set you back $5? (Drink included)Officially they are suppose to close at midnight - but they always seem open! I think they close whenever they feel like it!What I Don't Love: Absolutely nothing!",

We were tight on cash too, so one day, we had dinner at this place. I heard that it's always crowded at night, so we got there just before the dinner crowd came in. The menu includes the usual Malay fare but we weren't disappointed with the food! We loved the kick from the beef rendang, lontong and sayur lodeh. We paid an average of $5 per head for our meal.

Chunks of rice cakes, fermented beans (tempe), tofu, potatoes and shredded vegetables soaked in peanut gravy. It's really good! And I always start my meal with their ice milo! This place is often packed with people especially on weekend nights so it may not be that easy to get seats but it's sure worth the wait.",

The food can be quite spicy, so do make sure you order a drink to help quell the fire! I find the milky teh Penn here very good for that.Not only do they offer your usual nasi Padang dishes with a generous portion of rice, they also have dishes such as mee soto, mee rebus, mee siam and nasi goreng pattaya. All these dishes are pretty tasty in their own right.Prices are affordable, and service is efficient and fast. The staff are pretty friendly and will even joke around with you. An average meal will cost around $5 and above.I have to say, I think the standard has dropped a little over the years, but it's still satisfying and great value for money. Parking here can be really difficult, but this place is open till late at night, so you can drop to satisfy late night cravings!",
