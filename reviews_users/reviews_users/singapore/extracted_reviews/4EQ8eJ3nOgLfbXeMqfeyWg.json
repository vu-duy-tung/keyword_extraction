    "text": "This restaurant is excellent. The food is clearly fresh and very very tasty. Nothing much to complain about at all. Only it seems that they have lack of staff to serve all the tables. They also offer seasonal food according to the season in Japan from a specific city/prefecture and this time round when I came, it was from Kyushu. Lunch and dinner time usually are very packed so reservation is recommended. They have a lot of set menu options and each of them is different in a creative way. They have pretty good and affordable omakase set that is worth to try as well! They taste good, look good and good value for money. All food nicely placed in a set plate, compact and useful - very much a true Japanese neat and efficient manner. Will definitely come back again.I also like how the place is spacious, unlike other restaurants in Singapore.MUST TRY:All dessertsAffordable omakase set lunch",

I found it that it is pretty cheap for a restaurant to do that considering the prices of the sashimi.Average food with a high price. I have been there several times for lunch, and the price keeps climbing since. They have lunch sets from $20. The lunch sets are not particular special, neither is the food. I expected the $30 lunch set for the sashimi, salmon teriyaki, and tuna avocado don to be particular tasty.Expect to wait before getting seated if you do not have a reservation. The restaurant is almost full all the time.Good points: the ambiance, the location.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants as it serves pretty decent and affordable Japanese food. My favorite is the Shokado Bento during lunch. It literally has a bit of everything. Perfect when you are very hungry or cannot decide on what to have. It has sushi, sashimi, mini udon, tempura, salad, steak, cooked food and ice cream. Other dishes which I like is the foie gras lettuce. The foie gras is coated with some sweetish sauce and served on a lettuce leaf on toast. It is soft and smooth. The Hokkaido miso ramen is another favorite. It has an egg, thin slices of char siu and lots of corn kernels with a pat of Hokkaido butter which made the broth very tasty. The ebi mayonnaise is lovely but can be a bit rich. It is served with cubes of avocado and came in a basket of fried noodle strands. Besides the ever popular dragon and rainbow rolls, I like the roll with cream cheese and eel. It is a bit creamy and sweet at the same time.",

However, the manager came over, informed us and returned 20 cent in shilling. Most restaurants would just waive it and not inform us. I believe the manager's sincerity and action are commendable.Food wise, it is good. Not particularly WOW but it is still delicious. I would say the food is good in general. The restaurant's ambience is good as well. It is after all, a good place for gathering with friends with hard-to-come-by awesome service in Singapore!",

Aside from the ambience, I love the way they present the dishes, very pretty to look at yet very delicious. From time to time, their seasonal items are great too! Some of the items that I like at this restaurant are the SUN sashimi salad, Aburi Chirashidon, \u00a0delux hokkai kamameshi and \u00a0tofu cheesecake. They are amongst many delicious items that they serve at this restaurant. \u00a0Well, if you are in mood for varieties, you can try their set meals. They have great variety especially their lunch sets like Shokado BentoOften, it is very packed and have quite a queue on the evening but it is pretty worth it. Oh yes, they have pretty interesting drink mixes to accompany the meals too.",

It's pretty big and it has a decent view of Orchard Road. My husband and I came here on a weeknight without a reservation, and after a short wait we were seated.Everything on the menu looked promising. However, I didn't feel like spending too much so I just went for this dish that basically comprised of beef over rice. I forgot what it's called, but it was served to me in a small bento box and was about $20. The dish was mostly plain white rice, and nothing annoys me more than a bad meat to rice ratio! The beef was dry, sliced in small, one-inch pieces and there were probably about 10 pieces total. It came with 2-3 sauteed mushrooms and some onions, which were just okay. Overall, quite a disappointment.Other than that, the staff was pretty attentive, and the ambiance was nice. I guess if you order anything besides what I ordered, you should be fine.",

The ambience at wheelock was just fabulous , cozy and quiet during weekdays . Whenever I get there , I would get my usuals ; aburi salmon mentai and my hot honey green tea . Is not too raw and not too cook , just nice . Plus the drink is not too sweet , just perfect for my liking . And their seafood chawanmushi is nice too ! (: price is okay , cuz I guess the sushi's/raw food is imported directly from Japan , I think so ? That's why it's quite exp . But still , good food !",

You don't need deep pockets to eat here often, but it's mainly the ambience you're paying for.I had a sushi set lunch here and the rice in my nigiri wasn't packed together property - it kept falling apart when I picked it up with chopsticks. Could also tell the fish wasn't really fresh. The fish soup that came with it was insipid and covered in a thin layer of oil, and they were pretty stingy with the carrot slices. C'mon, carrots aren't that expensive. That cost around $25 pre-GST and I can assure you there are cheaper and higher quality Japanese set lunches in other restaurants.
