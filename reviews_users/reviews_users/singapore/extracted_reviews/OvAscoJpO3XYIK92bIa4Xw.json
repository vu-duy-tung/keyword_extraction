    "text": "Probably some of the best Indian food you're going to get in Singapore will come from Komala Vilas. They've come a long way in the last few years, since a visit from 2007 had left a lot to be desired, but the recent one was definitely one to remember.All the food is freshly prepared - you can taste it - and the service is very good as well. I recommend getting the uttapam or the dosas, and if you're into more custom/delux dosas, try the paneer butter masala dosa. It's really divine.The one other awesome thing is the prices. You can go feed an entire family of 4 there for under 20-25 bucks easy. And we're talking good portions, awesome sambhar and chutneys, and the whole nine yards! Definitely a great place to visit for Indian fare!",

I really liked my veggie korma curry as it was the perfect blend of creamy, sweet and spice and went very well with the naan. \u00a0We saw everyone ordering a tea drink so we also asked for it after the meal. \u00a0It's kind of like teh tariq as it's tea with milk but less sweet and you have to pur it back and forth into a little bowl to mix it. \u00a0I failed miserably the first few times and kind of made a mess but that was still a lot of fun. The tea drink is delicious so I'd recommend you to get one if you are there. \u00a0Service was efficient and we finished our meal within half an hour to move on to mustafa center, very good stop for some snacks when you are visiting Little India.",

However, much like to trick of eating at a hawker is to stand in the longest line, for eating ethnic food you know you are eating the real stuff if you're the only white person in the room. \u00a0Try it out, and don't be afraid to eat with your hands.",

The fact that we are here six times during our trip (generally during layovers between countries), it's safe to say this was our favorite restaurant. Komala Vila is located in the heart of little India. When you enter the restaurant the staff will seat you downstairs or escort you upstairs depending on capacity. Then you'll wash your hands because you won't find utensils here! The dish that kept both of us coming back was the Masala Dosa. The masala dosa is a crispy crepe rolled up and stuffed with potatoes, peas, and delicious spices. It's paired with three different dipping sauces. I have no idea what they were or what they were called but the yellow one is delicious!! If you're in the mood for something sweet order a mango lassi drink. It's a creamy yogurt based drink infused with fresh mangos. I'm salivating just thinking about my experiences at Komala Vilas.",

The upper floor is where I think there is full service of customers. I took my colleague (who is originally from San Francisco) to this place a couple of times. \u00a0We ordered masala dosa, bathura chole, parotta and kurma during the first visit. What can I say? \u00a0Excellent! \u00a0He enjoyed it too. On our second visit, we ordered the lunch meals, which was prepared well and plentiful. All in all, it was great tasting South Indian food. A couple of things - South Indian food is meant to eaten with hands mostly. \u00a0They have a wash basin to wash your hands. But it would be great to keep it a bit more cleaner. \u00a0 Also they take only cash. If you don't have cash, there is an ATM at a store ( a few feet nearby). I am docking them a star because of the slightly dirty wash basin. \u00a0I will definitely be back and highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "The first time I ever went to Singapore, over twenty years ago, I got there very late at night and after spending the night at my hotel near Orchard Road, got up early the next morning and took a taxi to Komala Vilas on Serangoon Road. \u00a0This was the first of many many visits with the most recent one being in late 2017. I sat downstairs and ordered idlis, a medhu vada and upma and then totally relished my wonderful breakfast. For those who do not know what an idling is, the answer is that it is a white colored soft discus shaped slightly sour cake, generally 3 to 4 inches in diameter, and made with fermented batter (like masa for tamales) using a mix of soaked rice and daal (lentils). \u00a0Medu vadas are savory fried donuts made from the same flour. Upuma is a savory version of cream of wheat, cooked in ghee and with bits of fried curry leaves, onions, mustard and fenugreek seeds with bits of dried and green chilies plus chopped green coriander leaves.By lunch time, I was craving the food at Komala Vilas again and upon getting there and learning about the special unlimited meals in the upstairs section, climbed the stairs and sat down at a marble topped table. In a few minutes a server placed a banana leaf in front of me with many small steel bowls. Another server came by and filled the utensils with different South Indian vegetarian preparations. I was served rice, papadums, sambar and rasam and after asking for a fork, started attacking what was in front of me. \u00a0Never having expected to finish all my rice, I was surprised when the server came around for more to find myself welcoming another helping. \u00a0It is unlimited and they will keep serving you until you say enough. The stomach will get filled even if the palate will keep wanting more.I have enjoyed this experience so many times without tiring of it, often to the frustration of my wife who would like to try other terrific restaurants, Indian or otherwise on this magnificent gastronomic gem called Singapore.My big frustration is that if Komala Vilas in Singapore can serve such delicious and perfectly prepared South Indian food, why can't other similar restaurants outside India, particularly those in the US do so? Even if some copy Komala Vilas' name they fail to replicate its food. If only the original Komala Vilas decides to expand to the San Francisco Bay Area, life could be so wonderful.",

Food was not killer hot (spicy hot), just pleasantly hot accompanied by a thick sweet mango lassi. Flavors were incredible. Loved it so much came back twice during a 10 day stay. BTW - I'm not normally into \"vegetarian\" anything! But after eating here I could take that path! Samosas were hot spicy as they were loaded with peppers.

    "text": "In town for 8 days on business and one of my co-workers had a local friend who suggested this place as its where the Singapore PM bought Indian Prime Minister Modi for lunch, when the later was visiting Singapore. Hey if it's good enough for Modi, it's good enough for me.One tip - strangest journey to get to the loos - you walk thru the kitchen and the dish washer and there is only 1 unisex toilet and the floor was covered with water! So definitely \u00a0avoid trying to go to the loo here.Food wise, this is a South Indian place so you can't go wrong with Dosa - however if you can't tolerate too much spice like me, just let the servers know because I didn't and my dosa came laden with green chillies! The sambar was truly lovely as was the coconut chutney. Not that big fan of the tomato chutney. Loved that you could get second helpings of the sambar and chutneys as well as the subzi for free. The local folks we were with got an Andhra Plate. I can't recall if this particular item was available only on weekends or just Sunday's but gosh, that plate was turbo loaded with food - no dosa include in this however, unfortunately!Would def return as good food at great price and free second helpings",

    "text": "People are ridiculous for giving less than 5 stars because they want meat. It's a vegetarian restaurant. If you aren't ok with that go elsewhere. Pretty simple but I guess it's too confusing for some.We loved our meals here! We (1 adult + 2 kids) were on a budget so we skipped drinks and used the pitcher of water at the table. For $15 USD we managed to get really good meals for all of us. If we had more to spend we would haved ordered more, but it's good to know what you can eat for less in Singapore. We were upstairs and did have about a 15 minute wait for a table. I didn't mind since a busy restaurant typically is a good sign. Not sure if the experience differs on the first floor. We will be back next time we are in town!",

Maybe they can heal their homesick by eating their traditional food. The servants are a little passive because they are too busy I guess. Try if you want to feel like being in India. No worry about using hand or not. They provide simple tablewares.",

    "text": "So I'm visiting Singapore and everyone has told me to visit little India - sure why not but I want to eat some good food here as well. So I ask my native friends to take me to a place that has good food and hello, here I am. When you walk in you know it's so authentic. There's a sink to wash your hands cause that's all you're gonna be using to eat with. Just the atmosphere and everything. Oh man. You've got to try the MANGO LASSI! Most I've had in America have been overly sweet but this. this was on point. Yogurt + Mango and the perfect amount of sweetness. So onto the food. We ordered Butter Naan and regular Naan and split several of the dipping dishes between 5 of us. We ordered 5 dishes and boy they creep up on you. I was so full by the end of the meal. To be honest after a while all of them started to taste similar to me - but I have low spicy tolerance and it was probably more of that speaking. I'm terrible at remembering names but there was this one dish that stood out that was green (I believe spinach / pea mixture). Anyway if you figure out which one that is you should try it :) Big hit with our table.",

I have been going to Komala Vilas for years and the service has always been good however, I had the worst interaction today with the service staff and was shocked. I had lunch with my sis and mum today. I ordered an Indian rice meal while the other 2 had dosas. Mine arrived first and both of them took a bite to try the food which was all they did. When I asked for an extra helping of the vegetable curry (which is the norm), I was told due to our sharing my food I was not eligible to get more food. The person attending to me was a manager so I explained that they had ordered their food and were just waiting. He served me the curry without issues. However, when I asked a waiter he absolutely refused to serve me until I raised my voice. I am DISGUSTED and SHOCKED. I have been a loyal customer since I was a child and go to the restaurant at least once a month. I even know some of the servers by face and name. This is the first time I have had such a miserable interaction and it spoilt my lunch. I am definitely going to stop recommending this restaurant to my non-Indian and foreign friends unless the service improves.",
