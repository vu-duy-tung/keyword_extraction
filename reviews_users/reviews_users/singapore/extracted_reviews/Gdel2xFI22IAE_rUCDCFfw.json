    "text": "Solid traditional Chinese/Teochew fare at good prices along Joo Chiat Road.First, this place is not to be confused with the other restaurant named \"New Ubin\" and other similarly titled establishments adopting the name of Singapore's rural offshore island. This place opened along Joo Chiat Road a couple of years ago under the name \"Ubin Seafood\" owned by the people who formerly ran the original seafood restaurant on Pulau Ubin.To further add to the confusion, in 2012 there was a change of management, and the name of the place changed from \"Ubin Seafood\" to \"Ubin Kitchen\". Chatter on the internet forums tells me that the head chef from the original Ubin establishment still helms the kitchen.Complicated history aside, it's possible to rattle off a laundry list of signature dishes that one should order:Steamed crab & glutinous rice (for 3-4 persons at $58)Bamboo ClamsOyster Hokkien NoodlesSteamed belly pork buns (Kou Rou Bao)fried shrimp rolls (hae zhor)salted egg yolk squidfried rice noodles (bee hoon)In particular, the oyster noodles were tender and had a hearty sauce, old school style. You see clams in the photo but there's some oysters somewhere hiding beneath the noodles. The pork buns were a DIY affair, fluffy steamed buns arrive separate from the pork and you'd have to create your pork sandwich yourself. All in all, I had a pretty good dinner.If Dorothy was Singaporean, she'd exclaim that \"We're not in Ubin anymore!\". I'm just glad I don't need to make it out across the water to eat the good stuff.",

Sure if someone gave him cash infusion to bring standard back up it would be great spot. \u00a0Wish him well.",

    "text": "THIS PLACE. How did it take so long for us to realise how awesome it is?!They're a seafood restaurant but they also do meat dishes pretty well. A lot of their main dishes take time to prepare (it could be a half hour wait, or even longer during peak dining hours) but the wait is seriously worth it.If you're already hungry, I'd start with the salted egg fried fish skin appetizer. WARNING: These are extremely addictive. Crispy, just the right amount of salt, and not at all fishy. Almost like potato chips.They even have a chicken rice stall within the restaurant, so you could order from them if you need something to hold you over while you wait.The crab dishes here are fantastic. We've tried the steamed crab with hua diao wine, and the steamed crab with glutinous rice. If I had to choose, I'd go with the glutinous rice, because that in itself is already delicious.Last but not least, I really love their kou rou bao (steamed buns with marinated braised pork belly.) Again, this dish takes time to make, but DAMN SON. The pork is so tender and the sauce is boss.This is a great spot to go to if you have a big group, as the round tables can fit about 8 people each. Plus, the portions are big here, so they're meant for sharing.",

    "text": "Ubin Kitchen is a FANTASTIC Teochew restaurant on Joo Chiat Road. My wife and I came here on Deepavali and decided to try some of the restaurant's specialties, namely the Kou Rou Bao (aka the \"Chinese Burger\" as indicated by our kind server) and the steamed Crab doused in hua diao wine and ginger.Kou Rou Bao was just stunning. The steamed buns came hot and fresh, while a separate plate held five slices of marinated braised pork belly. A a bit of a Do-it-yourself burger where you take a strip of pork belly put it inside a steam bun. If you'd like, you can also add a strip of lettuce to make it the more \"healthy.\" :PAs for the steamed crab, it was nothing short of special. This is not just some crab you put in a steamer and that's it. Nope, these crabs have a sophisticated flavour that blends hua diao wine with the juices of the crab. Wow. While all the crabs in Singapore focus on Chili Crabs or Pepper Crabs, it was nice to try something different for a change.Overall, the food at Ubin Kitchen was fantastic! Food wise, I'm of the view that it's 4.5 stars, but have settled on 4 stars since the server did not inform us that we would have to wait 30 minutes for both dishes.",

Everything tastes great and the price was very reasonable compared to any seafood restaurants along ECP. The venue isn't big but they have several round tables to accommodate big groups. Would definitely come back again!",

These two have to be on the table every time I patronise . What I enjoy is the service here. Whether it is to eat in or take away, service crew is helpful and courteous. If I am waiting for my take away, they would offer me barley to drink while waiting. The prices are affordable and family friendly. Portions are generous. Usually with 5 dishes for 7 people, I would expect to pay $80+. They can be quite packed during the weekend nights, otherwise during lunch, they should have spaces for groups.If you are a true blue teochew or just a lover of fried prawn rolls, they do it really well here too!",

It turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. The steamed crab is cooked in hua diao wine and ginger. The flesh of the crabs was really sweet and juicy, and they had an excellent bite to them showing that the crabs were very healthy and fresh. This one is amazing.Another dish that we tried was the salted egg squids, and this one was really nice as well. Overall, you simply cannot go wrong with most of the dishes in this seafood restaurant. Two thumbs up from me.",
