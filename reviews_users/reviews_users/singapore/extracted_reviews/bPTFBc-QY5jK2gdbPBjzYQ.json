    "text": "*This review pertains to my thoughts on just the drinks and service, not the food. My boyfriend and I had been exploring Singapore and decided it was time to head to Holland Village. It was late in the afternoon. We weren't particularly hungry given that we had pretty much been eating since we woke up. We were looking for a place to grab a drink and escape from the humidity. We passed by, and the gentleman who we would learn was the owner invited us in. As soon as we walked in, I knew I would like Hatched. Service: This is where Hatched and the owner earned all my stars. The owner treated us, and to my knowledge, all his guests like they were priceless. This is a huge, huge quality that I notice has been lost in the Singaporean service industry. You don't have to have the best food, but if you treat us well, I'll hand over my wallet. Rob was dripping sweat from walking around, and from the outside the owner who showed us in could see that. \u00a0So what does he do? Instead of simply leaving us to order our drinks and cool down from the AC, he brings over a FAN. Right then and there, he had won us over. I can't say that all the staff is like that, but they could learn a few things from that kind soul. Ambiance: It was decorated in a bird theme and looked cute and inviting. There was plenty of seating and reminded me of more than a cafe than of a restaurant. There were students studying and other couples like us who were there grabbing a quick bite. Drinks: we ordered the drinks that were on special, namely the $5 IPA and the $5 cider. Both were decent, similar to drinks we'd find back home in a restaurant. I wouldn't say they tasted 'crafty,' but they were good and we had another round. If you're around, stop in. I hope you find the owner.",

An egg costs about 30 cents in a supermarket - but a pair of basic Eggs Benedict can come up to $17 (after service charge & GST). What's up with that?And because they are just so versatile and scrumptious, there are just too many egg-enthusiasts who can't live without their egg-fixes in the mornings. If you happen to be one of them, you're going to have a ball of fun at Hatched.And for those who to stand out amongst all the eggy dishes at the brunch-table, or those who just can't stand eggs, Where's Waffle is the perfect way to go! Served with fresh blueberries, butter, fresh cream and maple syrup, these waffles are as good as waffles can get.",

It's likely that they used vinegar to help the egg hold together - a shortcut that makes it easier to get away with using stale eggs, but compromises on texture and taste. A restaurant purporting to specialise in eggs could have done better, especially at their prices.",

When I took a sip of the cappuccino, I wanted to throw up immediately. It was Foul!! They had used bad curdled milk for the coffee. Anyone who had ever froth milk would SEE or SMELL that the milk has already turned sour but the barrister didn't. I've been drinking coffee for a long time and this was the first time i've had such a Foul experience.The service - hmmm...not smart. They offered me a second cup. Honestly at that point I didn't even want to drink their coffee anymore. Finally, they have the weird sense to charge me for a cup of spoilt coffee. A savvy restaurant owner would have taken the coffee charge off the bill. The whole incident left a bad taste in every sense of the word and I'll never return to a food and beverage place where hygiene has been compromised by neglectful kitchen staff. Pass on this place ... Yuck.",

I used to frequent the outlet near the Botanic Gardens and was excited to hear that they were opening an outlet in Holland Village. The food is not bad, but its not great either. Last time I came I ordered French Toast with a side order of potatoes and I was really disappointed. The French Toast was really dry, it wasn't served with butter or syrup. I had to ask the waitress for it. The potatos were overcooked and dry. It was so bad that I didn't even finish my meal. And its not even that cheap either. It's a shame because the restaurant is really nice, especially the upstairs which is bright and spacious with a nice view.",

    "text": "We came to Hatched twice on a Sunday for lunch after church. \u00a0Both times we sat upstairs by the window. \u00a0The cappuccino was on the bitter side and needed extra sugar to mask it. \u00a0I ordered a salmon egg Benedict with two eggs both times. \u00a0The first time one egg was perfectly cooked with a thick runny yoke while the second egg was almost well done. \u00a0The second time, one egg was slightly under cooked where the egg whites and just set and the yoke barely warmed, while the second egg was cooked a bit longer. \u00a0So the eggs are not cooked consistently. \u00a0With a restaurant that's egg themed, one would have expect them to be the master of eggs. \u00a0My eldest son ordered the salmon with scramble egg. \u00a0While he enjoyed the egg and salmon, the toast underneath was just a piece of plain dry bread. \u00a0My 4 year old ordered the dippy egg and soldiers. \u00a0It was a fun dish for a child. \u00a0He enjoyed dipping the plain toast stick into the soft egg and rolling it in bacon crumbs. \u00a0The supposedly cheese crumbs didn't taste anything like cheese at all and cover very well be left out. \u00a0The French toast sticks were average and on the dry side. \u00a0The chicken wings were yummy and spicy. \u00a0The supposedly baked egg \u00a0with gooey cheese, mushroom and bacon was a little disappointing. \u00a0While the cheese topping was gooey alright while still hot, the egg yoke was like a crumbly hard boiled egg. \u00a0It tasted ok without the egg and would had been much more enjoyable with a soft runny egg. \u00a0Again, the supposedly egg expert screwed up on the egg once again. \u00a0There is a egg themed toy section on the first floor right in front of the cashier which children can play with various egg toys. \u00a0The older male (owner?) was very friendly and got a small basket of toys for my baby to play with. \u00a0Overall it was an enjoyable experience for the children.",

    "text": "Another all-day breakfast restaurant - perfect for a breakfast-food-lover like me. As the name Hatched suggests, the restaurant focuses on egg dishes, including those scrambled, poached, sunny-side up and even french toast. Pancakes, another breakfast favourite is of course offered as well. Meat lovers can also opt for the sausage platter, which is already self explanatory; a variety of sausages. Out of these choices, two remain my top picks - Eggs Benedict and Papillote. The first is a classic, with a poached egg balanced atop minced meat and an English muffin, drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Granted, the consistency of the eggs are not always perfect, but are right most of the time. Liquid egg yolk oozes out onto the plate, covering the rest of the ingredients to alleviate the taste. Coupled with the salty minced meat, the flavours are complex and excite your tastebuds, making you crave for more. The saut\u00e9ed potatoes served together are also delicious with just the right amount of herbs and spices. Papillote features smoked salmon with scrambled eggs and a dollop of sour cream on top of a piece of toast. The salty flavours of the smoke salmon is perfect to balance the taste of the scrambled eggs, eliminating the need to add additional seasonings like salt. But portion and presentation style may vary. Instead of the salmon neatly holding together the scrambled egg, I have received an explosion of scrambled egg topped with smoked salmon on several occasions. But despite appearances, the taste remains excellent as always.",
