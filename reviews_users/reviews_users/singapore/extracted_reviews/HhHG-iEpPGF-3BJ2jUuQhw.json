They've got you covered too with 2 x 1 Hendricks and tonic and do it up proper with cucumber garnish.Other than that, the food's nothing worth talking about and they do have a sign saying no dogs on patio but not sure how strictly it's enforced. Great happy hour spot as long as you're down with eating elsewhere",

Our favorite snacks are the Tango wings, which are scalding hot, but have an amazing taste! When the softshell crab is in stock that is also a winner. Plenty of servers to keep the beer flowing. One of the better stops along the Holland Village pub crawl.",

    "text": "Seriously a great place to kick back and hang out with friends. The drinks are cool to fight that hot Singapore weather while the ambiance fills with the chatter and bustle of Holland Village. \u00a0Service is pretty quick! I was surprised that the staff could stay on top of it as busy as it was when I was there. Something that stood out for me were how blazing hot and spicy the wings were. I am used to such flavors but this in particular had a zing that I will never forget. \u00a0Only bad thing about this place would be the men's room is ridiculously narrow and small. I am sure it is more than enough room for a local but for westerners and other larger people it's going to be cramped to say the least. I will have drinks here again when I am back in town!",

The caesar salad comes in a cheese bowl that is oh-so delicious, and the atmosphere is 'chill', the margaritas are refreshing and strong (and often 1-for-1!), the staff is mostly nice (except on one occasion, when we got an odd-behaving Filipino staff, but he was probably new), I'd come back here again, definitely.",

    "text": "Tango's has been in Holland Village for ages and is as much of an institution as Wala's next door. I go there for the Asahi one-for-one happy hour deal which is priced at a very reasonable $16.50++ for half a pint. Tango's location at the end of the street also means it's a little more spacious and quiet than the other smaller bars. The alfresco seating is quite nice for an evening out with friends. The margaritas are quite famous here and many regulars come back over the years to enjoy them.",

    "text": "If you've lived in the Holland Village area for a long time, you would know that Tango's is an iconic and long standing restaurant/bar. \u00a0I would say that Tango's is known for their calamari which is fried to perfection. The calamari used here are small \u00a0bite sized rings instead of the big chewy ones you get at most bars. Located towards the end of Holland Village, Tango's presents a much more relaxing and quieter atmosphere. A great place for enjoying a drink solo or catching up with friends!",

    "text": "Tango's is pretty much a Holland Village institution - being able to rival neighbouring Wala Wala as a place to go for decently priced drinks (especially during happy hour). Unlike it's more popular neighbour, Tango's is much quieter, with ceiling fans adding to the quaint (well, as quaint as Holland Village can get) atmosphere. That being said, the bar does have its loyal fans who go to Tango's for their yummy margaritas. Their lime flavoured magaritas are the best of the bunch - and too many afternoons have been spent at this bar getting drunk off cheap drinks, while gossiping with long lost friends. Their food is nothing to rave about - but hey, since when is bar food exceptionally delicious (discounting the tapas bars). That being said though, their bar snacks do serve the job of soaking up the alcohol imbibed. My best recommendation is to come here for their yummy margaritas, and then head over to one of the other restaurants in Holland Village for equally yummy food (:",
