Etna has a very warm and \u00a0'at home' feel. I ordered the pizza con funghi e salsiccia. It was HUGE, recommend sharing it. It was soooo good too. I ordered the tiramisu for dessert and the prosciutto con melone as a starter. The owner/chef is actually italian from Florence, very friendly guy :)",

The meals chosen really complimented the wines! A couple of the dishes were underwhelming, but other dishes were pretty good. Definitely a good bang for the buck!",

    "text": "A nice, cosy authentic Italian restaurant (sits about 20-30 people). We had been there a couple of times but our best meal was when the Italian chef/owner was in the house :) She came out host us personally, taking our orders and making recommendations of dishes that weren't on the menu. Basically, anything she felt like making... and we loved it! I especially enjoyed the Pan fried mozzarella! It wasn't too salty/oily like the one I had at Ristorante Pietrasanta (that one was BAD. avoid at all cost.) After the meal, the chef treated us to some wonderful rosolio liqueur that she personally brought back from the motherland. There were so many flavors & they all came in beautifully colored bottles (so pretty I wanted to keep them all). Don't underestimate the rosolio liqueurs! They may come in a small shot glass but they sure pack a punch! Think of them as mini tequila shots with a much nicer taste (some fruity, others nutty). The food 1. Calamari (grilled) - Ok. I prefer my squids fried. 2. Pan fried mozzarella - LOVE IT!!!3. Prawns - LOVE IT!!! It was so fresh, sweet and juicy. Served steamed (the best way to preserve the natural sweetness of its meat). 4. Crispy pitta-like bread (with a selection of dips) - LOVE IT!!! Despite their house bread not making the cut, their pitta-like bread won me over. I could snack on these babies all day. 5. Spagetti vongole - Good. 6. Spagetti with crab meat (tomato base) - Good. Popular dish here. Almost every table orders it. They are very generous with the crab meat and rich tomato sauce. 7. Steak - Good. Soft & tender. Served with a good sauce as well. Small portion though. 8. Pist\u00e1cio tiramisu cake - LOVE IT. I love Pist\u00e1cio flavored desserts (most of the time) as it gives any dish a little nutty kick to it. 9. Lava cake - Good. The service: ExcellentThe ambianceYou'll feel like you are dining in your Italian's friend's dining room. All the decoration (plates with drawings on them) are from Italy. The owners have brought a piece of their Italian culture/heritage to share :)",

The owner quickly regaled us with interesting facts about the daily specials, which included 2 fish dishes (sea bass and cod) and a pizza tipped with burrata. He enthusiastically educated us on the difference between run of the mill and burrata, replete with a thick Italian accent.",

    "text": "I have visited Etna a couple of times since a friend introduced it to me late last year. And it really never disappoints.I really like the starters and the mains that I have tried so far but I am not a fan of their desserts so I would give that a miss the next time I eat here. The burrata was great. Fresh and absolutely yummy. The etna pizza was absolutely the best pizza I had last year- great crust and crazily tasty toppings- super duper yummy mushrooms, ham and cheese. Apparently there were pistachios in the pizza but I really don't recall tasting that. The spaghetti with mullet roe was great too. And I have also tried the fettuccini with truffle cream that was also really good. I would totally recommend those dishes. \u00a0And very importantly, their portions were perfect. Not huge amounts but they will definitely leave you full. That is crucial in my books!As for desserts, I have tried their pistachio tiramisu (not spectacular) and the chocolate lava cake (the lava did not ooze out. it was just kind of hard, not at all molten as you would expect a lava cake to be). They were both not as great as their starters and mains.Their special wine pairing event that took place late last year was also really good. Most of the wines went well with the food and I was well happy with the food and drinks.Love the cosy feeling of this restaurant with its homely decor and non-pretentious and good service. And that makes the whole experience nicer. Anyway, in conclusion, Etna is highly recommended! Remember to make reservations if you want to try this during the weekend!",

Most entrees are $20-$30. They always have a few fresh pasta dishes on the menu (essential for an Italian restaurant, in my book). I highly recommend the burrata appetizer. The cheese itself is very soft and creamy (essentially liquid inside) and its served with a nice rocket salad and excellent prosciutto.",

It was very cutesy decorated and brought back memories of my honeymoon to Italy! It was about 8pm on a Wednesday night, the place was quite busy, and I was seated promptly. I was recommended a delicious Sicilian Cabernet and the mushroom pasta, and I have no regrets! They paired very well together! The mushroom ragout was very savory, which I love, and the portion size was perfect for me. I can't wait to go back and sample more of their delicious cuisine!",

Had their calamari and beef carpaccio for appetisers, linguine al granchio and snapper for mains paired with merlot and sparkling. Whilst we were off to a great start with their impressive appetisers, mains were a tad disappointing. There was nothing spectacular about their al granchio and it was served up with a crab claw. I may be demanding on this but I did not foresee getting my hands dirty trying to peel the meat off the crab in a fancy Italian restaurant. Snapper was fresh with a delectable capsicum sauce but it is not something I would specially head back to a restaurant for. Their service staff were friendly but I expected more attention to details. Overall, it was good but not great. I would head back again just to try out their lunch menu and coffee though.",

Burrata di Andria con Rucola, Pomodorini Pachino e Prosciutto di Parma 2. Wrapped and baked cod (Chef's special)3. Etna Pizza4. TiramisuThe burrata was fresh and the bf really enjoyed eating it with the parma ham but I wasn't too impressed. I enjoyed the burrata at La Latteria (basically across the street) much more. The baked cod was very disappointed. It wasn't fresh and barely tasted like fish! The Etna was definitely worth it! It came with parma ham and chunks of QUALITY mozzarella cheese! The pizzas were rather big so I suggest ordering just one to share. Maybe include an appetizer and some wine? You'll be good to go! As for the tiramisu, you MUST, MUST order it! The desserts are all made in house and the tiramisu was simply divine! The only dish I would die and come back for! It was covered in crushed pistachios, but special pistachios that are grown only in three parts of the world: Sicily, Israel, and Iran. So worth it! So DELLICCIOUSSS!! Service was alright, but, seriously, that tiramisu...*sigh*",

    "text": "Decent home style Italian place. It packs a busy crowd and you should definitely make reservation.The burrata appetizer is great. Most of the pasta were homemade. I didn't quite enjoy my pasta with truffle cream, porcini mushrooms and sausages. I usually dig anything with porcini and truffle, but the pasta is too thick for me, and the mushroom taste is overpowered. The other crab pasta was better but I prefer Valentino's version much better.Price point was very good. You get good value for money.Servings are a little on the big side so feel free to order to share. We wanted to order two appetizers to go with our two pastas and was advised by our server to just go with one appetizer. Good call as that left me with a tiny bit of stomach to have their dessert and a little cup of limoncello on the house. Woohoo.Service was great, warm and friendly. They made you feel that you are dining in a friend's home. The owner came over to ask if it was our first time here and how did we hear about them. I said YELP!",

    "text": "fantastic italian execution (not the head sort) at this packed restaurant in chinatown. reservations much required - tables run out quickly, and the place is well popular even on weekdays. it's been lauded as a great place to grab some italian and lives up to that reputation (living up to reputation seems to be a problem these days), with good service and reasonably prices.it spans that rather comfortable spectrum of cosy enough for date night but bright enough for family night, and the good food helps conversations flow.I'm not a huge fan of the mostly carb-heavy cuisine, but this side of it is right up my alley. lots of fresh seafood and ingredients simply done up and plated without too much fuss, enough to show detail and attention, but not enough that my food gets cold.it's also a fair portion size (barring the fish, which we'll talk about later), and I've realised recently how important this is for me. I've grown rather tired of poncy food in small dabs and dibs on a spartan place (unless it's truly meant to be that way - and what does that even mean?), and I want very much to feel satisfied and happy at the end of a meal.it was a meal of three starters and one main - and for good reason. the starters sounded more interesting and more creative than the mains (which were mostly plates of some seared meat-or-other), and were also cheaper (perhaps two or three starters were equivalent to one entree) - and they turned out that way too.we started with insalata mediterranea di verdure alla griglia, a warm salad of grilled grins topped with a light creamy cheese sauce and caramelized walnuts. I loved the sweet tender pumpkin with the crunchy nuts - and even though I usually eschew rich sauces, this was very tasty.and then the rather transcendental calamari alla griglia, or grilled squid coils with a lovely chop of garlic and herbs. delicious, plain delicious. seafood sweet and tender, these were salted just right and utterly fantastic.we had to round off the starters with some bruschette (it does, after all, take up a fair half page in the menu), and ended up with the etna, which had a slice each topped with chopped tomatoes, a grilled eggplant slice, parma ham and a slab of mozzarella. alright - but perhaps the most average dish we had. it was just a bit of toast with stuff, and not wholly inspiring (though the cheese was good).our nominal main was the day's special of salt-roasted fish, a slim specimen of a white type simply roasted with large grains of salt and served alongside a small salad. it was well cooked (and I don't mean doneness), with the flesh flaking off with a slight push - but it was also the most expensive dish at more-than-sixty for a slip of a fish, and not quite worth it considering what we had got as starters.it's definite that we had to finish with something sweet, and this time we had two. a tiramisu al pistacchio di bronte was a green layered rich concoction, with a very mild pistachio flavor - but at least it wasn't too sweet. a delizia al ciccolato was less interesting, and not flowy so much as moist - but it came with some delicious pistachio ice cream.I haven't mentioned service, and it was pretty good: just friendly enough without being unobtrusive, and they knew how to handle the crowds and seat people efficiently. price are very reasonable for the quality of food, though that statement holds truer for everything but the mains - and I'll be back to give some of their lauded pizzas a go.",

    "text": "I'd been to the one at East Coast Road before, and while the service was excellent, the food I tried was mediocre. This time around, however, it was the food that was great and the service was decent but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were nice and polite, but I didn't feel I could chat or really talk to them, which is fine, but a more casual approach would be nice. That being said, the restaurant does look a lot classier than the one in East Coast, so I guess they're catering to a different crowd who doesn't talk to service stuff much. Who knows. I had the Penne Arrabiatta ($18), which was just spicy enough and the pasta was cooked just nice in the traditional Italian al dente way. Too many places here sell out and overcook their pasta because that's what most locals prefer, so I like places like Etna and Modesto's who stick to their guns and serve it how it should be served. I also tried the Bruschetta ($8.50), which was really yummy. Bruschetta seems so simple but it's so easy to go wrong with it; Etna got it just right. I can't recall the name of the wine, but the red house pour was really good and went perfectly with the meal. By the time I was done with this, there was no room in my belly for desert, so I gave that a miss. Either way, the pasta and wine is ACE. :)",

I have been here 5-6 times (always for lunch) and am never dissappointed. \u00a0The weekday set lunch menu is a good bargain. \u00a0The small dining room is simple (maybe a little on the dull side) but tasteful with white table cloths and cloth napkins. \u00a0I wish they could knock out the wall between the two rooms to make it a larger more interesting dining area. The wood fired pizza oven is at the rear of the dining room in full view. \u00a0Highly recommend Etna for both food and the attentive service.",
