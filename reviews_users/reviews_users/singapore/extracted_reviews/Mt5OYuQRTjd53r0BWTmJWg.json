    "text": "Ramen place in Holland Village. Ramen here is pretty good - broth is delicious despite being a bit salty but the star is the chashu which was cooked perfectly. Noodles a bit too bouncy for my taste but this is a personal preference thing. Also tried the tsukemen (dry ramen to dip in a separate concentrated soup bowl) which taste pretty good but was a bit lacking in meat so you end up eating a lot of just ramen and sauce. Yes, the sauce was excellent (better than the ramen broth in my opinion) but the side dishes to eat with noodle was a bit lacking. Nonetheless, a solid option if you are in the area",

    "text": "Singaporeans have come to expect good ramen as much as reliable transport, an efficient Civil Service or the inevitability of National Service, death and taxes. \u00a0 This is one of the great perks of living in the Lion City...the not unreasonable expectation that when you sit down to a Japanese, Italian, Indian (covering most regional cuisines of India, but especially Southern), Cantonese, Teochew...that it will be good. \u00a0Good not only for the palate, but more often than not for the soul.The same can be said of Sanpoutei. \u00a0The menu is pretty much the standard document covering all the basics and I deeply appreciate their not over-committing to an extensive menu of \"also-rans\" but sticking to what they do best from ingredients that they can turn over at a healthy clip. \u00a0This means fresh, high quality, consistently good meals at Sanpoutei Holland Village, which if you eat out quite a bit turns out is something of a gift.I would personally recommend the sukemen, but I suspect that is largely going to be just me rather than the sukemen being very much better than everything else on the menu. \u00a0The sardines in the dipping broth deliver aroma, flavor and mouthfeel, the fat intensifying the texture and therefore increasing the depth of flavor. \u00a0This allows the sukemen broth to coat every bite of virgin noodle in a miasma of umami heavenliness. \u00a0 I came away from this meal feeling whole, not just full, but satisfied...pleasantly and comfortingly satisfied, and that's saying more about this meal than most in Singapore, a city replete with satisfying gustatory experiences.Thank you, Sanpoutei Holland Village!",

    "text": "Sanpoutei's signature ramen is the Niigata shoyu (soy), which has two types of sardines boiled into the broth for six hours. May sound weird at first, but it surprisingly worked quite well; it smelled fishier than it tasted.The CHASU, while layered with fat, was very flavorful and almost dissolved once I placed it on my tongue (probably due to all the fat). Interestingly though, very tasty with none of that fatty flavor -- probably due to the skilled cooking method. Dare I say the best I've ever had?! The soft-boiled eggs were quite delicately boiled to perfection and almost seemed to melt down in my mouth. The noodles were the wavy kind that I like, but thicker than most ramen, giving it a more firm and solid feeling. Thankfully, the bamboo wasn't the canned type and were thickly-cut, which heartily rounded out the ramen bowl.Ordered a hot green tea to drink, which came in a pot with a teabag and was slightly more watery than expected for a Japanese tea...perhaps the juices or sakes are the way to go.Overall -- one of the best ramenyas I've tried in Singapore!",

    "text": "Ever since I visited Rokurinsha at Ramen Street in Tokyo (which is highly recommended, but that's food for another review - sorry for the bad pun) I've been looking for Tsukemen ramen everywhere In the world and who would have thought I could find a decent version right at my doorstep, in Holland V?I walked into this Ramen joint unknowingly they serve Tsukemen, expecting the normal Ramen menu you find in most of these type of restaurants in Singapore and was pleasantly surprised to see it on the menu, especially as this is not common here. For those who are not familiar with Tsukemen, these are cold noodles to be dipped in a rich broth. The restaurant itself is a calm oasis (although the staff all greets you Japanese style - this means: loud, when you walk in), it has for sure a Japanese feel to it: modern and serene.The Tsukemen is a must try if you are in for a different ramen experience: the chewy, springy noodles come served on a bamboo mat and the sardine broth is not too fishy, it is thick, tasty and rich. They also serve an egg on the side which is definitely a nice addition but I must admit I had better ramen eggs. Another nice touch is that they give you a thermos with some stock to thin out the broth, or warm it up halfway if you are a slow eater like me.Even though the menu said this contains 1.5 times the amount of noodles compared to the normal ramen portion, at first sight I thought it would not be sufficient to feed my hungry and greedy tummy but it was more than sufficient as the broth is really rich.So now back to the key question: is it as good as Rokurinsha in Japan? No but it is certainly a good alternative, especially as this does not require a 6 hours flight but a few steps (or an mrt ride for those not living in this neighborhood: it is literally a few steps from the mrt station). So anyone who has a recommendation for good Tsukemen in Singapore, let me know, as I continue to search for a good alternatives.",

The space is quite cramped and the moment you step in, you see a straight row of chairs and tables. One nice touch is that they offer an individual basket for you to put your bags. Service is prompt and the portion is satisfying. The soup was rather oily for my liking but it reminded me of the ramen I ate in Japan so I guess that's a sign of authenticity? Haha. I had shoyu ramen. The bamboo shoots came in a big chunk and I would have liked it to be in smaller slices. Overall the taste is great and definitely one of the better ramen places in Singapore.",

    "text": "Pretty good, lighter ramen with AMAZING chashu as other reviewers mentioned!! However, I still prefer Keisuke franchise & probably won't be back unless I'm in holland v. I read about Sanpoutei in several \"Best Ramen of SG\" lists so of course I had to try it sometime. We only ended up here because we were too impatient to wait half an hour for Nakhon Kitchen to open oops. I'd recommend ordering the special order ($17.80) for shoyu ramen cuz it comes with 5 slices w chashu!! Chashu is the best part of this ramen so might as well eat more. I had the regular shoyu ($15), and the meat was so fatty and soft and perfectly charred. But I wasn't a fan of the noodles - a thicker, wavier texture than the thin straight cut of Ippudo and Keisuke. It didn't add much to the dish, and reminded me of Maggi mee, only harder. The egg was also a little over cooked around the edges, and yes that's a little nitpicky but I live for these ramen eggs...the largest difference was the broth. The shoyu wasn't creamy like the tonkotsu, and tasted vaguely fishy. It wasn't too salty as many shoyu broths are, but it just wasn't that delicious or shiok. The tables are also cramped very close together, so this is probably a place for a quicker meal. Glad I tried this, and it's good if you like this particular style of ramen, but I'll stick to my creamy oily tonkotsu ones I think!",

It's the kind of place you're hesitant to even recommend, for fear it would suddenly get impossible to get seats. The staff is on top of things. You immediately get noticed, you immediately get seated, you immediately get attended to, and the food comes quickly, even during busy hours.The interior is nicely done and well laid out. Tables are in a row and offer reasonable privacy. The lighting certainly helps. Booths are available for groups.A bowl of ramen is in the $14 range, full topping (extra chashu) brings it up to $18.90. And boy is it worth it. The chashu is perfect, the egg is perfect, the presentation is perfect, the noodles are great (made in house), and the broth, no matter which one you pick, is just a different league altogether from any other ramen I've tried in Singapore. People don't stop when they're done with the noodles, they finish their broth - that's always a good sign.If you're in the Holland Village neighbourhood, this is positively a place you should consider. I go there a couple of times per month and bring colleagues, and so far everyone found the food exceptional.",
