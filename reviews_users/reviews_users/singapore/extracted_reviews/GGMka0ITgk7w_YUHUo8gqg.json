It was also when the staff was eating their lunch made by the kitchen. You know food is good when their own staff eats there. Pho were $7.90 to $8.90 in price and the portions are great. Be sure to check this place out!",

It doesn't feel as authentic as Lung Phung in Joo Chiat, but if you do not want to hike to the east, maybe it is the best available option.The space is cute though. It try to emulate street eating in an air-conditioned environment. We do see Vietnamese eating there so it may be more authentic than the other Vietnamese chain stores in the city.",

    "text": "first off, the decor is awesome, it really reminds me of an upscale hipster version of vietnam - \u00a0from the rotating fans to the short stools, it has a really authentic street feel. everything was good but not great. the ONE THING I REALLY DISLIKE is that their soups don't come with any fresh herbs!! that's the best part of vietnamese food, piling on the bean sprouts, thai basil, mint - you dont get ANY of that here. a breakdown of my meal:- spring rolls: good except the noodles were way too overcooked and tasted like mush. but aside from that, loved the shrimp and the peanut sauce- green mango: really traditional. literally just green mango with chili powder. i enjoyed it but someone that didn't grow up eating it might find it underwhelming or odd. - pho dac biet: just ok. i really wish the broth was richer and more flavorful. i ended up adding a lot of lime, fish sauce and peppers to compensate. - bun bo: i actually enjoyed this dish, i think it could've used a little more shrimp paste but overall i thought it was good. but my biggest issue is that it was missing a LOT of traditional ingredients - no cha, no pigs blood, no CABBAGE. this place is... authentic vietnamese adjacent. however, i haven't had too much vietnamese food in sg but from what I hear, this is probably close to as good as it will get, so for that i'll be back.",

Our dishes arrived barely 5 minutes after orders were taken, in quick succession. We ate:1) Cha Gio ($3): lovely chunky texture, with wonderfully juicy porky flavours.2) Nem Nuong ($3.50): decent, but failed to leave an impression, in light of the most amazeballs minced patties in Hanoi just earlier this year. 3) Pho Ga ($7.90): delicate enough, but missing in richness of depth. A tip is to ask for extra lashings of basil and mint, essential in making it all come alive.4) Bun Bo Hue ($7.90): a hot and spicy beef noodle soup laden with stewed beef that was so-so, and a fantastic Vietnamese ham5) Bun Bo Xao Sa ($7.90) - chilled rice noodles tossed in a peanut-onion dressing, and topped with beef slices stir-fried with lemongrass: must-try and the best thing here, with its clean and clear and crisp flavours",

I had the sliced beef pho, while a little bland initially it's was spectacular when I added a little extra siracha and soy, which I prefer to it having been to salty or spicy to begin with. Also the flavor increased as the steak cooked into the broth. My friend had the spicy beef soup, something I didn't try it but he seemed quite happy. My other friend had the beef noodle stir fry which I did taste and I think it is the best Vietnamese stir fry I have had, which is quite high praise as I would never consider ordering something besides pho at a Vietnamese place until now. Prices were good, a little under $60 for all three of us with several appetizers and drinks, etc. All left full and happy.",

The beef pho, pho ga and bun are just OK (sometimes, the pho broth is tasteless) but it's still better than the overhyped: Nam Nam.Some things never change and those are the starters/sides. The chicken wings, beef balls and fried spring rolls are pretty good and I LURVE the cockles (they say it's fried in garlic but really, it's half a piglet of lard). The fresh spring rolls are hit and miss. \u00a0This place can VERY crowded during dinner. Best to go before 7pm. After 8pm, many items might be sold out. Eating there isn't the most comfortable. Chairs are too high for the table so your back will hurt if you linger. And they have this annoying habit of forcing 2 people to sit at two-top even when the restaurant's not crowded. Tables are SMALL. With the sauces, cutlery, pho bowls, side dishes and drinks, you practically need to sit at another table to eat. But hey, rules are rules. Cash only. No booze on the menu but I've seen the owners break out some Tiger around closing!",

I was greeted with the sound of people slurping their pho and distinctive Vietnamese chatter from the staff....great start....additionally it was 2:30 in the afternoon and the place was packed!Although the pho appears to be the must try, I was craving a rice plate so I went with the Com Suon Cha. Before I even get to the food, I just want to say that I was surprised to see how reasonably priced the items were. Nothing over $8, and the bowls of Pho I see coming out of the kitchen all looked huge. Anyway on to my food, The pork , eggs and the Vietnamese ham combo all blended in real well. Portion was just the right size, you won't come out overly full. I also opted for a fresh spring roll appetizer. I'll have you check out the pictures for yourselves.It was real authentic and took me back to Vietnam and San Jose hahaha. My only complaint....I wish the would add more items as I'm sure Mrs. pho would make them so well!Apart from the food, I liked the decor of the restaurant, very rustic and modern, in keeping with the interior design of most places around Haji lane. I'll definitely come back here and review the Pho!",

Super authentic and original! Nearest MRT: Nicoll highway! It's along the shophouses across Sultan plaza and opposite of Concourse building.Avoid lunch and dinner time to prevent yourself from having to wait to be seated. Best to come after 1 or before 12. I'll be back!",

This place is packed on weekdays - come by 12noon for lunch if you want to get a seat and not have to wait in the queue.The pho was delicious. The noodles and the broth were excellent. I wish there were more greens (basil, mint) with the pho. I'm not sure why there weren't more. Aside (IMPORTANT QUESTION): I've had pho in other places (usually overseas but at actual Vietnamese-run small shops) and often you get a whole plate of greens and taugey to add. Or is this a Vietnamese-American thing? I've had actual Vietnamese people tell me conflicting things - is it a regional thing? If you are Vietnamese from Vietnam and can explain this, please tell me!",

The pho was delicious - you get a lot for what you pay for. The spring rolls were fresh and bigger than I expected. They come with a peanut sauce. The avocado smoothie was tasty. I wanted to try star fruit juice and the spicy mango out of curiosity and wasn't in love but if you already like those things I'm sure they're good. I would strongly recommend this place if you're looking for pho for a very reasonable price! We ordered two entrees, two appetizers, and three drinks for S$56 and gratuity was included.",

Yum.The line here on weekends can get quite insane, but I arrived at 6pm and held on to my table for dear life. Service is efficient but they were quite confused with our orders as we constantly placed new orders instead of placing one at one go. I guess they're more used to people who show up to eat and leave, and not us grazing types.The fresh roll is not my favorite but I quite liked the meatballs. They're nice and juicy and come with a delicious dipping sauce. But enough distractions, let me talk about the crab noodles. Unlike pho, they come with mee tai mak which is a kind of short rice noodle and is super slippery and look like little tails. As a result, you have to scoop them up with a spoon, inhaling all that delicious broth along the way. The soup is like a super jazzed up version of pho broth, with all the added umami delightfulness of crab and seafood. The bowl is generously topped with crab & pork meatballs as well as some shrimp. I literally inhaled the entire bowl in one go and had barely anything left for my companions who wanted to try it. Oops.I would go back again just for my favorite crab noodles. I've also tried the bun and pho which are good but ... pale in comparison to those crabby, savory, delicious noodles.",

The ph broth is pretty flavourful, but it is NOT served piping hot as it should be; the 'special' version only has beef brisket and beef balls, but no raw beef or tripes; and the beef brisket is rather chewy. The mini clams is cooked with a delightful garlic sauce and served with sinful but scrumptious lard. The chicken wings are below average. Venturing to the toilet shows how unhygienic part of the back section is. Next time, we would try newly-opened Ph C\u00f4 Hai on the same block of Beach Road. Or stick to Long Phng in Joo Chiat which is much better, more authentic and with a more diverse, longer menu.",

I've never been disappointed by their bowl, but it's always good to have a backup in case they are closed or when i'm not near the East. So here is another trusted alternative- Mrs Pho. Mrs Pho has been on my food list for a bit because it has been recommended by trusted foodie friends like Miss Tam Chiak and Superfinefeline. So after several half baked attempts to visit (despite being in the area), Jr and i finally dropped by for a taste test. \u00a0 Standard side order of Goi Cuon ($3.50 for 2). Thin and chewy rice paper rolls filled with rice vermicelli, slices of prawn and pork belly, paired with that 'chee cheong fun' sauce.Now on to the star, their Pho! Have the Pho Bo Tai ($7.90) Sliced Beef Noodle Soup or the Pho Dac Biet ($8.90)- Special Beef Combination Noodle Soup. The former is a no frills bowl that comes with thin and tender beef slices, while the latter has meatballs, brisket, beef, and a half cooked egg. I thought the beef balls were very authentic and indeed they are freshly shipped from Vietnam weekly! As compared to Long Phung, we think that Mrs Pho does a more delicate bowl of noodles with milder flavors. Of course, you can always spice it up with the accompanying fish sauce, lime, and chili. If you are not for beef, there's also Pho Ga ($7.90) Chicken Noodle Soup, and Bun Mam ($8.90) Assam Seafood Noodle Soup. and other vermicelli and rice dishes. Start or end your meal at Mrs Pho with the Iced Ca Phe Sua Da ($3). I thought it was rather smooth and not too sweet really! The Avocado Smoothie ($4.50) was decent too. Now i know where to head to for a perk me up in the Bugis area! A good Ca Phe Sua Da is so hard to come by in Singapore. And of course, the pho. Come here if you can't take Joo Chiat's grittiness, Mrs Pho is definitely more for the young hipsters.",

Food order is easy - write your own order sheet which is available on the table and then proceed to the counter to place them. Very soon after, our pho arrived. Though I would have preferred to have our starter of papaya salad come first, it came a bit later. We ordered the simple beef pho $7.90, my personal benchmark of a good pho. To be really honest, there was hardly any beefy aroma when the bowl hit the table. Taste wise, brothwas rather mild as well. I am used to a stronger beefy broth and would have liked more than the couple of token mint leaves and herbs to add more aromatics. Oh well. A squirt of hoisin and hot sauce and a squeeze of calamansi lime were added in an attempt to lift up the taste. Better but still short of what is good. Nonetheless I do appreciate this more than Nam Nam's version (which I feel uses lots of artificial seasonings). The papaya salad was very good though! Just papaya, a few shrimps and a good dressing and topping of shredded pork, fried onions and crushed peanuts. $6.50The table for two pax is rather small, given that all the condiments are provided (which is a good thing and convenient) but do take up a bit of space. Our 2 bowls of noodles, 2 drinks and 1 appetizer took up every area.",

I grew up eating pho in Canada (both Toronto and Vancouver) where you just cannot miss the numerous pho restaurants dotting the cities. So my standard of good pho is what you get from any pho place in North America. There is just no bad pho over there and it is a staple food in every Vietnamese family there. First off, the chairs are most uncomfortable. The stools are too high for me to eat off the table easily, I felt I was bending over double just to eat, and I am a short person. Then the combination of air conditioning and fan going gives two types of temperature. You get the cool air followed by a blast of warm air, it is most disconcerting. I ordered the sliced beef and brisket pho with extra beef balls. The soup is tasty though I wish it also comes with a side plate of bean sprouts and basil and slice chili and lime for customer to add to it. The meat is terrible. I cannot see or taste the brisket at all, and the meat is very chewy and tough. Such a big disappointment. The beef ball is good though I cannot tell if it is handmade or from a machine. The summer tea takes some getting used to. I will suggest to stick to the Vietnamese coffee or something. The service is good though. Bring cash. I do not remember if it accept NETS. Definitely no credit card facility here. At the moment, I think Pho Tam Anh at Chinatown Point is better for pho.",

Hailing from Melbourne, with a massive Vietnamese population (and having had two Vietnamese ex-girlfriends!), my judgements of Vietnamese food are always benchmarked against what I've had back home.Which means I'm usually disappointed here in Singapore. We ordered pho special (dac biet), Vietnamese \"Assam laksa\", some goi cuon (fresh rice paper rolls), and a couple of drinks. The goi cuon was good, fresh, with a great sauce. Pho was good - probably best I've had so far in SG - but still not \"Melbourne good\". Of course, it was a damn sight better than the ridiculously overhyped, overrated and overpriced NamNam. It was missing the depth and \"roundness\" of flavour that I love about pho. Generous with meats, though I missed the bits of Vietnamese sausage, tripe and beef tendons that I've come to expect. The Assam laksa was a bit unusual, complex flavours, I wasn't a fan. \u00a0Service was good, friendly and fast. $30 for two of us. Tables are literally 4-6 inches apart from each other, so not the most pleasant ambience. Overall worth a try. I just hope people stop going to NamNam.",

    "text": "Food taste - authenticPrice - reasonable market rate (chicken / beef Pho: SGD7.90)Ambience - Just like typical Vietnamese restaurant, but just half a shop, so very noisy and crowded. Seating - Just stool. non back support so have to finish fast and leave. Not suitable for pregnancy woman and children Tips: Avoid weekend especially Saturday, the soup finish by 8pm yet the shop close at 10pm. So everyone don't get any soup based stuff except Asam soup based (in the picture) and spicy beef soup. BBQ pork Rice and dry vermicelli still available. No Tax (GST) but charges 10% for service charge (the usual)Charges service charge but had to go to counter to pay bill. So the only service they do is to bring your order to your table, doesn't justify the 10% service charge.",

I'd prefer to have more herbs than cucumber though.Chicken pho also delicious, with lotsa herbs & soup is full of flavor.Vietnamese coffee was just ok. Not fragrant enough.I love the small table outside the shop with stools... So much like how the locals eat by the roadside in Vietnam!All in all, food is pretty authentic and value for money.",

The spring roles with pork and shrimp are a must have, they are well complemented by the sauce. You may need to ask for more sauce! The food was served very quickly and the decor was interesting.Will go back again as I hear the meatballs are amazing. More to come :)",
