    "text": "This was a spur of the moment choice as we explored the Kampong Glam, Arab Street and Haji Lane area close to Bugis in Singapore. The area outside the restaurant is pedestrianized and on a Saturday early evening, there was a live band playing right outside this restaurant. The entire area has a very unique and eclectic feel to it, so we decided to forego a trip to the Usual Suspects of Singapore restaurants in the city itself, and try Derwish. We were seated very quickly inside what is quite a small restaurant, although there appears to be additional seating areas upstairs. We ordered a lamb pide after plucking up the courage to ask the people at the table next to us what it was they were eating. Yes, I know some might consider this rude, but it looked too good to pass up. The salad was a simple tomato and cucumber salad chopped up with some fresh warm cheese. The lamb pide was simply wonderful. For those unfamiliar with the dish, as we were, it is like a thinner Calzone pizza with a spicy minced lamb and cheese filling. It was the star of the show. Both dishes arrived very efficiently which became the watch word for the level of service throughout the meal. The staff really busted a gut keeping up with the demand from hungry customers. Most of the time it remained efficient, but we did notice two tables who waited forever for their drinks despite asking at least twice. The mixed kebab was tasty, but the sauce that the meat was in was little bland for my taste, the minced lamb, lamb chop and chicken breast pieces all tasted very good, but the chicken wing was a bit lacking in flavor. The Turkish coffee we ordered was strong and as you consumed it the consistency changed to a much thicker mud like. Our lack of experience in eating Turkish food, may come through in the review, but overall we gave it four stars with one off for the inconsistent level of the service, despite the wait staff working so hard.",

    "text": "Came here through a recommendation of a friend's friend on a public holiday. Surprisingly wasn't too crowded even though we arrived there at about 6pm.Parking around here will be the street parkings where parking coupons are essential.This restaurant comprises of indoor and outdoor seating. We were given choices on the seating arrangement. After minutes of looking over the menu, we decided to get a mix of kebabs, hummus and bread and K\u00fcnefe (see description of what this dish entails through Jeannie's review). For the drink, I ordered a glass of Turkish Apple tea.The hummus and bread arrived first. Was a little salty but the texture was well-pureed. It definitely satisfied my tastebuds and kept on scooping for more even though there were no bread left. The kebabs. It has pita bread at the bottom and on the middle was a layer of rice pilaf (not too fond of) and three types of meat (lamb, beef and chicken - either on a skewer or not). The meat was pretty tender and the spices made it tastier. It was definitely on the pricier end but it is worth a try.The K\u00fcnefe was special. First time trying this dish out. The first look it reminded me of the crunchy noodles. First bite, it was delightful in the mouth and the crunchiness of this dish made me continue to dig in. A must try dish here.The apple tea wasn't too special. It was fruity and not too sweet. The three of us paid approximately $75 for the three dishes and three drinks. Was a little pricy but somehow we were satisfied with the dishes. :)",

I've had some pretty good renditions of the dish outside Singapore and simply had to find it somewhere.Forget baklava - K\u00fcnefe is a dish made of cheese and lots of sugar syrup sandwiched between 2 layers of baked kadayif, the noodle-like phyllo dough that looks like fried bee hoon. When done right, it's one of the best desserts.The version at this restaurant came with a generous serving of cream around the pastry, and it was heavenly. The kadayif was crispy without being overly soggy with the syrup. Freshness-wise I guess it's okay, considering we're 5000 miles away from the Bosphorus Strait.But at $9 per serving, perhaps you should bring a friend to share it with. Tar-powing (packing) the leftovers doesn't do it justice. Will be back for my sugar high sometime.",

    "text": "Came here for anniversary dinner w the bf! :) He had a coupon from Bliss or something of that sort, entitled us to an appetizer, a lavash bread, mixed kebab, chicken (or lamb) stew, and a dessert.Some of the food was pretty good, other dishes I found a bit on the salty side, so it's really more of a 3.5 than a 3. Bf thought that the saltiness was probably offset by the carbs (i.e. bread/rice), I guess that's true but I'd have preferred less salt still! Nevertheless, would recommend lavash bread and kunefe dessert!Appetizer - babagannus! $7.50 (yes.. I seem to have been on a roasted eggplant spree) - this one apparently was more descriptive in the menu - capsicum, crushed red peppers, butter (i bet there was a substantial amount!), mixed with a touch of garlic with homemade yogurt. This was not bad, definitely had more flavour than Cafe Le Caire. I thought it was a bit on the salty side too though. And the portion seemed a little small! Cool that there were some chunks of eggplant. Bread that came with it was so-so, quite thick but not that warm/crisp on the outside.Lavash Bread - awesome!!! $4 or so I think, can't remember exactly. Huge puff of happiness :) Came warm and toasty fresh out of the kiln (I'm guessing). Black and white sesame seeds lavishly sprinkled atop, crisp bottom (cracker-like). Patlican Musakka - Mediterranean stew $22 (chose chicken, don't like lamb that much) w eggplant and potatoes (the eggplant was really gd! potatoes not bad too, tender), topped w cheese and baked in a claypot. There was some sort of a tomato-ish sauce, which was kind of salty.. Very umami though! It was pretty nice to spoon the stew onto the lavash bread.Mixed kebab platter - 2 beef kebabs (fairly tender); 2 chicken kebabs (also pretty tender, but a bit salty!); 1 chicken wing & small drumstick (same, tender but a bit salty); 1 lamb chop (REALLY tender! amazing..) and one sausage-like thing that I'm not sure if it was made of minced lamb/chicken/beef. Came with rice and some sort of a tomatoey sauce as well (tasted different from the sauce in the stew). The rice that came with the stew and platter was pretty good.Dessert!! Chose the kunefe :) YUM! $9. Shredded wheat, fresh cream cheese and honey syrup, with tring pastry. [this is copied directly from the menu, no idea what 'tring pastry' is, guess it was \"string\" haha.] Anyway, I guess it must've been baked cos the top was browned and crispy, mm! Cream cheese sauce surrounding the pastry was not sweet (surprised me, I thought it was like a vanilla sauce or something), went really well with the pastry threads/honey inside. Words just fail to describe how awesome/interesting it was. We had to make a conscious effort not to finish the whole thing, given how full we already were from all the food before!Service was pretty good. Oh, we had a turkish apple tea as well - that was really sweet.. We had to ask them to add more water. Also, bf noted that it seemed like they had tea bags sitting at the back - begs the question whether their \"freshly brewed\" tea is really from the leaves, or just tea bags? Hmm. Ah well.",

    "text": "I personally find it challenging to find a nice halal restaurant with nice ambience, great food and good value in town for a good team lunch sometimes. How glad I was to have the recent team lunch at Derwish! Cos we made reservations for 14 pax, we were directed to the room upstairs (I see it sort of like an overflow room) instead of the usual seating at level one. Because there werent anyone else upstairs except for our team, it's as if we were given the royal treatment of a lavishly decorated room and dedicated service staff. :PAnyway, the food is really great in such a setting cos we could order a variety for communal sharing. Dishes such as the mixed kebab, the kofte and even the pizza were great. Too bad I cant share any photos cos my Hp got reset and I lost the images but the presentation of the meal is pretty cool as they use really nice engraved plates and utensils.Overall a great dinning experience. The only thing that got us a little nervous (since we were having lunch and dont have the luxury of time) was time management as the food do take quite some time to arrive. We tried to avoid the situation by pre-ordering some side dishes when we made our reservations but those also came quite slowly.If you are in a hurry, this may not be the best place but given ample time to just chill and relax with friends and family, the experience should not disappoint.",

    "text": "Arab street has become one of my favourite areas in Singapore. From the famous mosque in the background, to the many folks enjoying shisha in their hookah at nights, it is definitely a site to see if \u00a0you're living or visiting in Singapore. There are plenty of food options as well, and I decided to stop at Derwish because of their ambience and the fact that they had a decent amount of visitors at the time. I sat at a cool table, and waited for our server. There was obviously only 1 person serving at the time, and he looked overwhelmed. I had to wave him down. If I wouldn't have waved him down, he probably would have never taken me or my wife's order. After placing our order for food, drinks and shisha, I sat back and relaxed. Well, that relaxation came to a halt since our server decided to move us to another table. Something about no smoking there. Okay, that's fine. He moved us to an awkward table that didn't seem clean and the area seemed to smell funny. Well, after 5 minutes of trying to relax, he stopped by and asked if I would move... AGAIN. If I wasn't patient that evening, I would have told him to screw the order and left for another establishment. But I was calm and I moved again (mostly because I felt bad for the guy since he was the only one that seemed to be working).The food was okay, the shisha was the wrong flavour, and the only saving grace was the strawberry smoothie. After our experience, let's say I don't plan on ever returning to this place and I don't recommend anyone to visit either.",

This and Sufi, and 2 other places come under the same management. But the menu is different from Sufi, though they are both Turkish restaurants. The options are pretty standard - but not really the same. They don't have Doners here.What I Love: I really liked their decor - it had a very Turkish / Mediterranean feel to it - and the ornate walls and cutlery really did transport you to another place. I loved the menu - the visual; aesthetics of the place is pretty nice - pretty lamps everywhere. The ambiance is pretty nice, it's bustling, staff running around - was pretty cool. It felt alive, and there was character about the place. The food was very tasty! Sorta like Sufi. Ordered the Sucuk Pide (starter), which was yummmmmy. A eggplant starter, Saksuka, which I ordered more Lavash bread for. And a Iskandar. Everything we ordered was yummy. It's quite a comprehensive menu.What I Don't Love: Service is a bit slow here. And the staff could be a bit more observant. So, gotta get their attention quite a bit!",

    "text": "Came here with my fiance. Ordered the mezze platter which is usually a sure bet. 4 out of the 6 items were soaked in mayo and looked like they'd been sitting in big industrial tubs for a couple years. Not fresh. We didn't touch those items and asked nicely if we could get some more hummus. The waiter said \"1 more order of hummus? Sure!\" and tried to charge us. We asked for it as a replacement. He said \"no.\" So it just sat there, uneaten. At the end of the meal, we sent 80% of it back to the kitchen, then asked for it to be removed from the bill. The manager refused. It was pretty awful food, and an awful customer experience to top it off. A definite tourist trap, we should have known better.",
