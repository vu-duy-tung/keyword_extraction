This is my favourite Japanese restaurant in Singapore.The food is so good. Everything is so fresh, so tasty and although I can't remember what the names of the dishes are... I'm never disappointed. My impression is that all the seafood was fresh and cooked (or uncooked) to perfection.The service is very good and both indoor and outdoor dining experiences were excellent. I've never had the set lunch but I've heard that they have good deals at lunch time.Two Thumbs up.",

Don't be tempted by their sashimi and sushi menus though, based on previous experience, they arent really that fresh. But other than that, go ahead and get anything from the ala carte menu. The service is relatively good and efficient, and the staff appear to be quite knowledgeable about the food they serve.A notable item to try is their Kyoho Grape Ice cream. It's slightly pricey but the taste makes it worth every cent.",

It seems that the direct neighbour venue, also a sushi restaurant, is much more popular, because there is always sitting the majority of the poeple. But with the sushi menus, every served with a soup and desert, you get a good meal with a good cost-benefit ratio. And it is high quality sushi. Only saying.",

    "text": "I honestly would not have suggested Nagae for lunch if I had not heard about the set lunch first. One look at the shop and its location at Waterfront Plaza, and it was clear that this place is not in my price range for an average lunch. I had a grilled salmon rice set which consisted of 9 items in total and it was $19++. In fact, their set lunch was actually impressively extensive from katsudon to udon or soba, to huge rice sets and at a price range of about $16++ to $25++. Although that is not exactly cheap, given the prices of Japanese food that I've sampled in the past month, it is quite reasonable. In fact, the katsudon is cheaper than Ginza Bairin. Service was, without a doubt, outstanding. From the minute I stepped in, I was taken care of, including pulling my chair out, removing the paper cover of my chopsticks, hot towels and hangers for our bags. The location, beside the river, was somewhat scenic but it was a little too hot for dining outdoors. My only disappointment was after the meal. We were hoping to have ice-cream after our meal upon realizing that they had sakura ice-cream, but we were informed too late that they were actually closed at 3pm and so we could not have our dessert. As you would expect from a Japanese restaurant that had Japanese customers, the food was delicious. I had my grilled salmon with just salt but the salmon was soft inside and the skin was cooked to a crisp. There were 9 items in the rice set, namely cucumbers and pickles, lotus root, bitter gourd, chawanmushi, rice, miso soup, the main i.e. salmon, 2 slices of sashimi and watermelon. I especially liked the lotus root dish which was sweet and savoury as well as the silky chawanmushi. For the price I paid, I was rather impressed by the meal which was a lot more than I had expected. I will definitely have more lunches with my friend while she's still working in the area.",

We also tried something the menu called Water shield in vinegar... which was actually water lily and quite tasty! I would definitely go back and recommend it to anyone wanting good sushi and nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "People who know me would know that I don't give five stars very easily. I only ordered a few dishes but they were all very good. And I was blown away by the salmon belly sashimi. It is just so hard to find good salmon belly sashimi, and it is ironic that I find the best salmon belly sashimi not in california, not in japan (at least where I've been) but here in Singapore. In general, my attitude towards japanese food in Singapore is \"jaded\". I feel like in order to get decent sashimi, you usually have to pay an arm and a leg. And usually when I do, I am not impressed by the quality. This salmon belly is well marbled with fat, super fresh, and evey slightly sweet! Even at 6 bucks a slice, I am willing to pay it. The chef recommendation's seasonal dish, salmon roe with soy sauce and yuzu was another winner. The salmon roe was not at all salty (which means it's fresh) and lightly seasoned with soy sauce, and the yuzu just brings finesse to it. The grilled saba was decent, but not impressive. Will definitely come back for the omakase or chirashi or just a sushi meal. Thank you for making me believe in Singapore again!",

    "text": "Had a little craving for Japanese food (again) and decided to drop by this place based on the recommendation of my good friend.The d\u00e9cor of this place is fairly simple but I found it to be welcoming. I was here during dinnertime and although there was not much of a queue, there was still quite a lot of people in the restaurant.I had the grilled teriyaki gindara set, which was, to be honest, quite average. Perhaps they weren't having a particularly good day, but I found that the gindara here wasn't too fresh and was even slightly overcooked. However, the taste was pretty good to be honest.We also had the tempura, and I enjoyed this a lot. I found that the prawn tempura was soft and crispy, with just a touch of oil and has a very good bite to it. Definitely high recommended.Overall, this is a great place to have a decent Japanese meal with good ambience.",
