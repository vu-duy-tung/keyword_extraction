    "text": "Popular Japanese place with branches at Chjimes and CBD. Overall, the food is standard good. Basically hits expectation for a semi-upscale Japanese place. Best feature is the variety for lunch sets. There are sushi, sashimi, tempura, beef sets, etc. which are served in a bento box with appetizers, desserts and drinks.Would recommend for a business lunch given its convenient location and consistently good food overall. But don't expect anything particularly good or memorableNeed to make reservations.",

    "text": "Looking around the place, you can tell that this is definitely a teppanyaki restaurant. There are many tables surrounding a flat hot grill. Being there by myself on my business trip I decided to go for the sushi bar. My rating is based on the sushi bar experience, but also must try the teppanyaki.Ordered the Omakase for a single person. It ended up being a small variety of sashimi pieces. When I get Omakase I expect a collection of artfully crafted pieces of sashimi with thoughtful and original flavoring and sauces. Disappointed to say the least. So in my book, this was just a simple plate of Sashimi. 40 SGD for a small variety of sashimi is extremely expensive compared to what I see in the San Francisco/San Jose area. Since the variety was so small, also ordered the spicy tuna maki and a Maguro and Shake Salmon sushi. Incredibly the spicy tuna was 12 SGD and the single pieces of Maguro and Shake were 4 SGD each. Wow, I'm definitely not used to these prices. I wonder if most of Singapore is like this. The Sashimi order was just ok, the fish did taste pretty fresh as expected being on an island. The spicy tuna was very disappointing. It had a small piece of maguro with some spice to it and a small piece of tempura of some sort. Disappointed in this place for sure. Would give it 2 stars except I probably should have gotten the Teppanyaki. The sushi is definitely not what you come here for.",

    "text": "With the help of my trusty Yelp application my boyfriend and I found this place our first night in Singapore. Located in Chijmes it was easy to find and NO ONE was eating there. Lucky for us because it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. The entire restaurants attention was on us. Chef Kenny was our main sushi chef and he was on point! We never even ordered off the menu. He asked us what we didn't like- (which was only salmon for me- dirty dirty salmon) and then proceeded to feed us course after course of delicious, beautifully prepared food. The madai sashimi was on of my favs. We also had huge pacific gulf oysters. They served us a steamed fish with root veggies in a great sauce. There was also baked razor clams with a cheesy creamy topping baked to a crisp. Soooo good. The white tuna was marinated in usukuchi and served sushi style with a bit of grated lemon peel. It was my favorite of everything we ate. We finished with black sesame ice cream. Service was impeccable and I loved every moment of the meal. I would come back here in a heartbeat!",

The rectangular flavored cold egg with black writing stamped on top was surprisingly tasty. The service was great also.",
