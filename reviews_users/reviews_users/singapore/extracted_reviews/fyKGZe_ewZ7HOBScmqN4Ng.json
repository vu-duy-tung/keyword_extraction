This place has been opened forever and is located in Chinatown. We ordered the French toast combo, which comes with french toast, two eggs and a coffee or tea of your choice. The French toast comes with their homemade kaya spread. It was divine! Yes, it's hot and you're sweating but come and experience an authentic Singaporean breakfast!",

    "text": "This came up on a couple places of \"best kaya toast\" and since I wanted to explore Chinatown anyway, I thought, why not. To be honest, while it was good, it didn't blow me away. I felt like the toast came out cold, like it had been sitting waiting for me. The butter was cold (as is the style, I think) and a kind of thin application of kaya. I skipped the eggs, not being an egg guy, which confused the staff, apparently not ordering a \"set\" of kaya toast, soft boiled eggs, and kopi is unusual. That said, the kopi-C was probably the best I had while I was in Singapore. Very rich, not overly sweet...I came here on my first morning for my first meal, and it started a love affair, that's for sure. And as with most other small places I ate in Singapore, it's amazingly cheap, just a few dollars.",

    "text": "For a traditional Singaporean breakfast this is certainly a good, albeit basic, place to go to. We had the regular kaya combo with kopi, and one French toast variation with tea.The toast was nice with the right amount of butter and kaya, and the french toast was delicious (some argued that it is too dry which I cannot confirm). The eggs were quite runny, thus my husband did not touch them and I guess this might be a no-go to a lot of (European) people.What I like about this place? The traditional feel, the many locals, the good food (apart maybe from the egg-situation) low cost (we paid 11 S$), and the option to sit outside under the fans (tables there might be quite dirty when it is busy). What I don't like? The ignorant attitude by some of the girls working there. Yes, we do not speak Chinese, but ignoring requests and stomping off does not help. We are nice people, and my husband is the most polite and friendliest person I know, however when he asked for more toast, twice, he got blank stares or was plainly ignored by the female staff, just left standing.Thus, although I liked the place initially, I might not visit again.",

The one dish I always order is the \"Gan Xiang Ji\" which is prawn paste marinated fried chicken tossed in a piquant vinegar-soy sauce. Hints of lemongrass, curry leaves, chilli adds to the layers of flavours. Sweet, salty, tangy, spicy and crispy, this is one flavour bomb that begs for a bowl of rice ok the side!",

This place seems like anything you order would be pretty good and they sauce things very well. We ordered: 1) scallop rolls: they are famous for this but I'm not that into it because of the mayo. The crunch is good on this though. 2) chicken clay pot: another famous dish of theirs, I enjoyed it. 3) tofu with minced meat: loved this dish!! Of my faves! 4) coffee ribs: I don't like coffee but for coffee lovers I would order this, it tastes like coffee...5) bak choy: a favorite for me, so good I couldn't stop picking at it.6) Kaya toast: generally like this dish but who doesn't like kaya Oddly I enjoyed the veggie dishes more than their famous ones but everything will satisfy you.",

Still pretty good, but there's just something that hasn't quite jelled yet.And I get it. You occupy one location as a kopi tiam for 75 years, hand down recipes, grill grease and oven char generation after generation, basically watch Keong Saik go from a dirty road of prostitution to Singapore's new \"it\" street while still continuing to pump out fast, cheap and flavorful dishes and some of the best kopi and kaya I've ever had, and then you get forced to up and move to a new spot and are expected to pick up right where you left off? No. Impossible. But despite the star-downgrade, just know that I will stay loyal (and from the recent lunchtime queue, it seems others will as well) even as you work through the new make-shift spaces and kinks. You still have the flavorful coffee ribs. You still have the juicy finger chicken. You're still a master of the soft boiled egg art. And you still have my heart.",
