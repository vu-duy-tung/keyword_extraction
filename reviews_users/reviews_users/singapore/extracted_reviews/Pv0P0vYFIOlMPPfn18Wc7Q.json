    "text": "I've had a pretty tough, long week and by last night, was dying for some good alcohol (in moderation) and food. Given that I've tried most of the bars in the CBD (don't judge) and was sick of seeing the CBD, I thought the man and I should head down to Orchard and try Tanuki Raw. Orchard Rd has always been a conundrum for me bar-wise. There are so few good bars that you're often stuck with the same ones: No.5/Ice Cold for martini's/beer happy hour and the best har cheong gai, KPO if one wants to fraternize with traders or creative types working in the area, martini's at Hyatt, \u00a0maybe Cuscaden patio of you're really short on cash. So when I heard about Tanuki Raw, it sounded like a great addition to the Orchard bar scene - fresh, Japanese-inspired seafood and strong drinks at affordable prices. Tanuki is a little difficult to find if you're coming in from the side escalator, so I recommend you do it sober (oh come on now you know this is good advice). The bar itself is industrial chic with an outdoor area overlooking Orchard Rd and borders more on a restobar than a bar per se. The Tony Collins I ordered (which is broadly speaking like an old school one-up on the G&T) was very good. It was almost perfectly balanced so that I could taste a fine lemonade and the gin without one overpowering the other. That's quite a feat considering there's a gentleman's pour in there (that's +1pt in my book of awesome bartenders who know what some women really want). I'd say definitely give the cocktail list a shot (pun not intended) because they've really put some thought and care into it.Food-wise, I wanted to be blown away but wasn't. As drinkers and not restaurant patrons, you're looking for 1-2 dishes to go with your drinks and therefore the food has to excel out the door. We had the Ocean Rockefeller, Tori Karaage and the free Truffle Fries that came with a Yelp check-in. The Ocean Rockerfeller didn't quite work for me because it was neither punchy, sizzling or juicy.The dish was really salmon, scallops and jellyfish lightly seasoned and topped with grated cheese that looked like it came out a bag and torched just enough for the cheese to lump together but not melt. I mean guys, we're talking about a dish named after Rockerfeller, so one is hoping for intense flavors and at the least, good cheese. Even from an aburi sushi angle, I couldn't see the merit. As for the chicken karaage I have two words: 5 Izakaya. Bottom line, definitely drink. But maybe stick to the oysters that literally every table was offering or indulge in the simple raw dishes like sashimi. I do think the bar bites need some work because in today's bar scene, even the humble fried protein done well can lure many, many regulars for life.",

Okay, more that the balcony is lovely, since it's just above the ever-bustling Orchard Road, but just high enough to feel that you're away from the maddening crowd.An easy pick were the rice bowls - lots of variety here. Oyster mentako (yes, they're an oyster bar, you know), steak tartare, the Godfather(?!), and a Salmon bowl with sashimi, belly, aburi AND ikura(!!!): too many to choose from! I was in the mood for some Yakitori, and being greedy, we were recommended some Trio Carpaccio to share. Salmon, tuna and swordfish in different sauces? YUM. And this is coming from a new sashimi convert, so believe that this stuff is pretty solid.A check-in on Yelp revealed an offer for a free basket of truffle fries, and you know me, I can never turn down some fries, or something free... I need to come back for Happy Hour(s) [5-8pm daily], when they serve $1 oysters and cocktails at $11! Anyone with me?",

However the swordfish sashimi we ordered was a little bit off as well as our second order of oysters. Could've just been an off day? I'd still go back, but would probably avoid the raw food to be safe! I think Alicia pan performs there on Mondays too.",

This is not the place to expect bespoke cocktails and note that you are also just paying $10 per drink during happy hours.Sad to note that the very appetizing cerviche trio in most of the yelp photos is no longer on the menu.Not a fan of this particular mall but the $1 oysters will be a good reminder to return.Note that in the evening, when the birds return home, you will need to outdo the hundreds of birds chirping if you choose to sit outdoors.",

    "text": "I've been visiting Tanuki a little too often; I am worrying for my cholesterol level since my two favorite items are the $1 oysters and the musubi sushi.The $1 oysters are so sweet and fresh that you barely need the vinegar or Tabasco sauce they provide. Best of all, it's consistent. I've had about two dozen oysters over multiple trips, and only chanced upon one stale tasting oyster. The waitstaff were quick to replace it with a fresh one when I pointed it out to them.The musubi sushi is so sinful but delicious. It's a little too salty (and I'm saying this even as a huge fan of luncheon meat), so it would be great if it had more rice, so the spam to rice ratio would balance the flavors out a little.Cocktails are cheap, delicious and especially strong. I once visited while nursing a hangover after a crazy night out and requested for less alcohol in my cocktail but it still tasted like a gentleman's pour, generous!The service is great, I was particularly impressed by our server who was especially attentive. He brought out an additional glass of water and menu within seconds of my friend arriving at the table, impressive! The manager of Tanuki also gave out free shots of a delicious candy flavored shot, called Alice in Wonderland.Outdoor sitting can get a little iffy because of the crazy amount of birds chirping in the trees next to the balcony and very strong fans positioned right next to tables.Am excited for my future visits, which will definitely be regular, I'm definitely gonna try the cheeseburger roll for my next visit. I hope the oyster happy hour (5 - 8pm) is gonna last beyond the soft launch months. Keeping my fingers crossed because it almost seems too good to be true! Pro-tip: Check in on Yelp or FourSquare to get free truffle fries!",

The food took extremely long to come and the serving was small. They took my order but apparently didn't key it into the system hence a double wait time on top of that. The offer displayed on the yelp profile that you can redeem after checking in was also \"out of stock\". The kicker was when my food finally arrived, it was cold. Our party tried almost half their menu and can't recommend any dish that was good.",

    "text": "Tanuki Raw, founded by the people behind Standing Sushi Bar, has been gaining a loyal following thanks to its Happy Hour Treats (available from 5-8pm daily). Queues stretch once it hits 630pm and the working crowd is set free and many rush to enjoy the Martinis ($10), Salmon Sashimi ($3 for 5 slices, limited to 1 portion per drink) and Freshly-Shucked Oysters ($2 each, limited to half dozen per drink).The Salmon Sashimi was a gem, thickly-sliced and with a freshness that leaves us tempted to order more drinks just to get our hand at the sliced raw fish.Most patrons in the snaking queue during happy hour are waiting for this: Fine de Claire Oysters at $2 a pop. I don't usually eat oysters, but I gave these a try and were glad they did not have the fishy taste I detest about shellfish and was easy on the throat, especially with a dash of lemon juice.Drinks wise, I thought the Margarita was one of the worse I have had, so please don't order that. Other drinks like Sidecar and Mojito (all $11 during happy hour) were average, nothing to write home about.We also tried mains like the Salmon Mentaiko Don ($20) and Vegetable Don ($12), of which no photos were taken because the presentation was a disgrace. For $20, the salmon mentaiko don was also overpriced and I would just be sticking to the drinks and happy hour deals when I next return.For pictures and the full review visit voraciousappetite.wordpr\u2026",

    "text": "We were a group of 6. Everyone ordered their own so I got to try a few drinks and a little food. This place was so awful I felt I needed to say something. I don't know what the other reviewers were thinking. #1. I got one of their vinegar based drinks and I felt it was undrinkable (pineapple and rum I think, too sweet and just didn't work for me). I didn't expect anything from them so nothing lost. The friend who got the gin based vinegar cocktail was happy with hers. #2. Oysters were gritty i.e. not washed well. #3. Salmon sashimi tasted like fridge burn (maybe we were just too early to get fresh stuff). #4. My friend's nachos were basically chips and dip. Fine, it's described at tortilla chips and a selection of dips but these were average to poor at best. #5. Out of exasperation (and thirst) I ended up getting a Guinness draft and the trio of fries (spam fries, lotus fries and shoestring fries). How could this go wrong, right? However, no worries for this place. Little basket, everything obviously refried/over fried; everything like crisps. Still not the WORST thing for during the middle of our session, a roach crawls on the table. One of our party picks it up to show the staff and they basically do nothing. Most places I will say, perhaps they had a poor night but this place had absolutely no positives at all. I will not be giving them another chance; they didn't even try to make up for their deficiencies with good service. The prevailing attitude was more take-it-or-leave which is truly unacceptable if there is NO product that was worthy of admiration. This place just plain SUX. I was glad we went elsewhere for dinner.",

As for our glasses of Water Melon Yuzu. Fresh watermelon juice were already prepared before hand and kept in the fridge. They just have to mix portion of it with yuzu and served them on the \"rocks\".Water Melon Yuzu - $10While Tanuki Raw is having a house promotion for happy hour daily from 5-8pm, we get to order Oysters at $2 each, limited to 6 pcs per glass of drink. The fresh raw oysters they served were brought in from Canada, France and Japan.Fresh Oysters - $2 EachBesides having that, we ordered a plate of 5 slices salmon that falls under the happy hour promotion too. It was great having Sashimi again with Wasabi and Soy Sauce!For bites, seeing Sweet Potato Fries excites me. These thick-cut sweet potato fries were deep fried with Tanuki Raw's spice mix, truffle oil and served with truffle aioli in an aluminium tin.Truffle Sweet Potato Fries - $10.90One of the recommended rolls on the Menu is none other than the Golden Kani Maki with deep fried house seasoned soft shell crab, fresh snow crab, cucumber and crispy mozzarella all in a roll. Divided into portion of 4, these delicious rolls were topped with toasted seaweed and drizzled with generous amount of golden salted duck egg hollandaise sauce.Golden Kani Maki - $18.90Well, we just did not have enough of salmon and here comes the seared salmon roll topped with Mentaiko sauce over some crispy mozzarella cheese, seasoned flakes and Tanuki's Oko Sauce! Yums!Superstar Roll - $12.90It was my first time there and would not be my last. Simply love the environment. Best of all, if you are having gathering with friends who are vegetarians, there are food for them too. Hope to be back soon.",

Although the truffle was a nice touch, I wish the beef was slightly more cooked, at least seared, and cut thinner for the flavour to really come through.

Sitting in outdoor, one also can enjoy the great view of the busy Orchard Road.While looking through the menu, I was served iced water. A bit disappointed as the water was not refilled. Maybe sitting outdoor was not so good after all, as it was difficult to get the attention of the staffs.Although it was weekend, the restaurant offered lunch menu. Just add $2++ to the main dish to make it a lunch set. I decided to have a Premium Set by topping $5++. The set included miso soup, green salad, and coffee or \"Back to work\" beverage.Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku ($19.90++)pan-seared foie gras, US black angus short rib, onsen egg, truffle soy, black garlic brown butter over Tanuki's signature mixed riceThe foie gras was quite buttery and melt in the mouth. The beef was quite tender and moist. The mixed rice was tasty on its own.Miso SoupThe soup was filled with chunky pieces of tofu and seaweed. The soup tasted light and flavourful.Green SaladThe salad was lightly tossed with ginger soyu dressing. Light and crunchy.Shio Smooth (a la carte $5++)fresh shiso, matcha green tea, lemon, blended with iceIt was my choice of \"Back to work\" beverage. It was light and refreshing in taste. Just the right to have during such a hot day.Overall the food was not bad. But the service needed to be improved as it was quite difficult to get the attraction of the staffs.",

Subsequently I had returned a few times and the food was still ok but my last visit last week was downright terrible.My favorite item was always the American Roll as I loved the beef with rice. However this was more chewy (due to the thick flour coating the roll) and carbs laden than before. More rice than meat. It was so bad I just removed the outer layer. No longer can I rave about this to my friends now. The Rockstar which my friend ordered was equally average to not so nice like before. Did the chef change? The only thing which had it going was its happy hour promotion of $2 oyster and $10 cocktail. Those were still decent though my friend said her drink was not as potent as before.",

    "text": "A Raw-Ing good time Another one of those places that have been opened a while but was skeptical of trying, primarily due to it looking like another upmarket restaurant that tries too hard to be different. While I still think that it's slightly on the pricy side, the food, I have to admit that it was a joy to have! Happy Hour oysters and Martini, shaken not stirred (sorry.. Just had to add that in)We were there before 8 pm (they do sell themselves as a bar so I suppose 8pm does makes sense for happy hour) and decided to give their oysters a try. At $2.00 an oyster with every alcoholic drink bought (at $10.00 for a martini, it worked out to $22.00 for 6 oysters, under $4.00 each), it wasn't too bad. As their name suggests, they do specialize in Raw dishes so the quality of the oysters were definitely there. Don't expect the super rich, high end $7-12 French oysters but still, decently sized and very fresh oysters. The Lychee Martini itself was pretty good too. Unlike most bars who taste like they're serving lychee syrup, you could taste the alcohol in the drink and it was nice that they gave 2 lychees instead of 1.(minor detail I know but for a lychee lover, it's a huge plus point) Ocean RockefellerThis would have made a great starter to any dinner. Served in 3 varieties, the raw salmon, scallops and spicy lobster was well thought through. Serves In a scallop shell, the torched Mozzarella tied the ingredients in nicely and added a touch of saltiness to the dish. The salmon was fresh, the scallops were nice and sweet and the lobster, while spicy to some, was a great way to end the trio. Sunshine Donburi Now this.... This is the kind of rice bowl we dreamt of as a kid (and definitely today too). What could be better than a bowl of rice, served with bacon, luncheon meat, smoked duck breast and an egg! I'm just happy that the luncheon meat and bacon were not fried to death. What could have made this dish better though was if they served it with a poached or Ajitsuke Tamago (the ramen eggs). The yolk would have helped make the dish a little richer and help tie in the ingredients better, making it a complete dish and not just rice with 3 ingredients. Can't wait to be back for their lunch specials, which IS slightly cheaper than their regular Ala Carte Menu. An overall great place to eat and meet up with friends, though definitely on the pricy side. Only draw back? Service wasn't as friendly as it could have been, given the fact that you're paying $15-20 a main.",

I've been here at least ten times now (based on my check ins via Yelp but I have been a frequent visitor even before Yelp launched in Singapore--so there!), and I've realized that I must have judged Tanuki too harshly in the beginning stages of our relationship.Service was slowed, waiters forgot my orders, and the food was pretty meh. Then, after the Japanese fusion bloom, I realized that Tanuki does fusion the best. Give the American Roll or Steak Tartar a try, or my personal favorite Taco Fish (though it should really be Fish Tacos...why are they trying to confuse people?)!Granted, the rolls here aren't up to par with the ones found in the States (Am I the only one who's heard of the Lion King roll?!) but for Singapore, they are excellent. I'm also a huge fan of their shrubs! Vinegar + Alchol = Bombdigitty! For $10 at Happy Hour, you NEED to order one! Blueberry shrub!",

    "text": "I've been here twice. Once when my american professor was visiting Singapore and we held gathering for him and another at Yelp's Elite event. Overall, it's safe to say that the food is very much a fusion of American-Japanese cuisines. 1. American roll - A cheeseburger sushi, wrapped in rice, and deep-fried, tempura style. Enough said. I couldn't really tell all these ingredients apart when I want munching on them but it tasted pretty ok. Not as weird as my brain would have anticipated. Maybe it was a good thing that it was dim so I was not biased by my visual perception. 2. Spicy fish taco - Good. The taco was soft. The fish was fried (crispy on the outside & soft on the inside). They added some green chilis too. 3. Cheesesteak in a steamed bao bun - This reminded me of Philadelphia Cheesesteak that you can get on the side of any new-york street cart. Replacing the usual bun with steam bao was an interesting twist. I think I prefer baos to buns now. \u00a04. Apple & Lychee martinis - They were generous with their alcohol. After 1.5 glasses, I could feel it hitting me. Although, I felt that the Apple ones were a little too sweet. \u00a05. Truffle fries - Good. 6. $1 Oysters - I am not a fan of Oysters but if you are I am guessing this might sweeten the deal? AmbianceGreat for overlooking the bustling streets of Orchard road. Although beware of Singapore's unforgiving humidity when deciding between outdoor or indoor seating.",

This explained the additional order of one oyster each from four different region with all at $3 except for one premium piece at $5Besides raw food like sashimi, we also tried the tapas and sushi. the sushi tasted much better than the tapas but it was understandably a raw bar and thus the targeted market might be narrower than those going for a full cooked fare..",
