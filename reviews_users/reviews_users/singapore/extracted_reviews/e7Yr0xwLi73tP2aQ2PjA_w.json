    "text": "There's not many places open for breakfast at 8am in Novena, particularly places that accept credit cards. I was running low on data on my international roaming, so I did the unthinkable and went to a cafe without checking it out on Yelp first. Luckily when I connected to the Wi-Fi at Old Town White Coffee, Yelp told me I made a good choice. The Wi-Fi is fast and free - hurrah.My Singaporean friend tells me this is a Malaysian chain of cafes. I opted for the kaya toast which comes with soft boiled (extremely soft) eggs, and toast with your choice of kaya or peanut butter for $7. I got some hot teh and was set up for a hearty breakfast. Service was friendly, and the food came out reasonably quickly. Definitely one to stop in at if you need an early breakfast and you're in the area.",

Bad service, slow service, and very irritatingly, you have to ring a bell for service. And considering how bad and slow service was, that Bell was ringing incessantly. And I don't mean by me, it's one Bell that keeps ringing regardless who presses it. For a place with 'coffee' in its name, you'd expect it to have good coffee. But no, what they have is almost like the instant machine type you get from vending machines. Not something freshly brewed. The Javanese noodles I had wasn't too bad, but for what you pay, I'll look for something else next time.",

    "text": "It took me a while to warm up to the Old Town White Coffee chain. I didn't know much about it, no one ever recommended that I go there, and with it's presence all over the place I thought it would just offer sub par food.The first time my husband and I tried Old Town was actually in Malaysia. We took a weekend trip to Penang. It was a Sunday and a lot of the hawkers were closed. Long story short, we were touring the area with a rickshaw driver and got extremely hungry. Our knowledgable driver spoke highly of this place and recommended that we eat there.I forgot what we ordered, but we were impressed! And the prices were affordable! So when we came back to SG, we knew we should visit again.Luckily, this outlet near our place satisfies our craving each time. Our favorites are the curry chicken dish (which they say isn't spicy but trust me, it has a decent kick to it) and the BBQ chicken noodles. I fell in love with chendul in Penang, and they do offer it here, so one day I hope to give it a try.If we're not in the mood to eat outside or to walk to our favorite hawker, we always end up here. The comfortable environment and affordable prices make my husband and I huge fans. Watch out, Nik T- your dukedom here is in danger!! ;)",
