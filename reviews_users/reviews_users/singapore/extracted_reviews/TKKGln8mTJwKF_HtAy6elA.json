The vegetarian options are limited (2 burgers), but that wasn't surprising.The fries covered in gravy and cheese are utterly brilliant.Love the classic 70s diner ambiance, and the reasonably priced beer.",

Not sure if their standard has dropped over the years, since the other reviews are from a while back.We ordered the chocolate malt shake, and three burgers. The burgers were average while the fries were rather oily and soggy.Thumbs up for the atmosphere, but that's about it. A good place to chill with friends at night, but probably not worth the price and the GST and service charge. We spent around $20 per person",

Glad my hubby insisted on ordering it!He had the Bleu Cheese Peppercorn burger and I stole a bite. I would say it's more peppercorn than Bleu cheese taste there. Not a bad tasting burger at all. I had the Swiss Shroom Burger and it's good! Lots of oozing cheese and chunky mushrooms juicy patty! Had the vanilla milkshake and it's definitely made of good stuff! Very yummy!!!Definitely scratched our burger itch!! Will be back again when our itch acts up again!!",

They have a lot of options to choose even nutella or peanut butter as the burger sauce, quite unique! If you live in this area, this is a really great place to hang out casually compare to the overrated coffee joint next door. I like the ambiance, it's so chill, relaxing and unpretentious. The beef patty for my customized burger was not that great but did not disappoint, only hate the extremely thick buns. I had onion rings here too but I find it way too oily. However, milkshakes were great, I had the vanilla base with nutella. They also serve the best cider on earth from a UK brand in my favorite toffee apple flavor (not many places have this in Singapore btw). Overall, it's a great place to hang out with a mediocre food quality but great drinks nonetheless.",

It's actually too big for my liking as I have difficulties finishing it so I normally go for the smaller version, which is named \"Wimpy\". Good thing is Wimpy comes in 3 choices of patty i.e. pork, beef or lamb.Their chips ain't great but the burgers more than make up for it. Best in this little red dot in my humble opinion.",

    "text": "Perhaps the best thing about Fatboy's is that they're serious about the burgers they offer. I found that out the first time I made a trip down to the outlet located in Upper Thomson. My fellow foodie Jeffrey had heard about it and was eager to give the burgers a try. While there are other offerings on the menu, we were very focused on our goal to test the burgers and subs out. What made it even more special was the opportunity to build our very own burger. Imagine a burger that has what you like. I was immediately sold on that and decided to build my own.The burgers were delivered and were instantly devoured by the both of us. Portions were huge and I can remember that I instantly made a mental note to come back should I have a burger craving. The sub we had was pretty decent, together with an assortment of appetizers. I would suggest sticking to the burgers as they do that very well. The subsequent visits we made were to try out their speciality burgers and guess what, they rock as well! But still nothing beats the burgers we customized ourselves!",

Its just a lovely beef patty, gorgeous mushrooms and melted cheese with that awesome garlic aoli. Its simple yet heavenly.My friend ordered the Fat Basterd and he opened up the burger, seperated each level of the burger and very methodically ate each ingredient on its own. I guess Fatboy's gives people the opportunity to enjoy their food in a very innovative way. LOL.",

My friend had a craving for burgers after our evening lecture, so we headed down to trusty Thomson road for some late night supper (TGIF!!)I tried the Elvis burger previously, very interesting combination of pork patty, banana and pb&j with fresh greens! I'll recommend this to anyone who wants to be slighty adventurous....Well I just wanted to go with a safe burger this time round so... HOLY CAESER ($12). It was goooood.... The chicken was done perfectly! I've eaten at The Handburger before and this was comparable! Huge serving of straight cut, chunky fries. I am usually pretty conscious about the food I put into myself, but the fries... Gosh addictive :)I'll be going back for more next week to celebrate my friends' birthdays!!",
