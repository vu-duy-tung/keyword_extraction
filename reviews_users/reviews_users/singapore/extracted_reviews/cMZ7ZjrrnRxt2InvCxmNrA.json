A small entrance bar- good bar service. \u00a0Two dining rooms with plentiful, capable wait staff. \u00a0It's good Italian (not inspiring) with an attentive wait staff. \u00a0The place has an excellent wine menu. \u00a0If you can afford it - dne here.",

For starters, I recommend splitting the 'Dream' (S188++) with a partner: so decadent but how delicious - cold angel hair pasta with prawn, oyster, scallop, uni and caviar! Having the dish on your own would be too rich for most people. Classical dishes like osso bucco and veal milanesa are prepared to perfection here; the former melts in your mouth, the latter is juicy with very light 'batter'. Pricey, but still cheaper than the top Japanese restaurants!",

    "text": "We dropped in as most of the eateries in our neighbourhood had closed for business by 9:30 pm - Garibaldi seems to be one of very few places open late.The staff was very friendly and courteous, we were asked to have a drink in the bar area whilst a table was set for us.When our table was ready we were taken to the main dining area which has a very calming atmosphere, with white and light coloured wood being predominant - complete with curtains to draw out the outside noises and lights. Our waiter introduced us to the set-menu, five courses with coffee, all truffle-themed for 188 S$ per person. It sounded great but we did not want to eat all that much - and spend a little less on dinner.We decided to go with half a dozen oysters (Australia & NZ), shared a scallop/white truffles pasta starter and had pan roasted sea bass with vegetables as main.The food was delicious, the oysters fresh and very tasty, the pasta with scallops cooked to perfection and with the fresh truffle shavings just divine.The fish had a nice crispy skin and the meat was just perfect both in terms of texture and flavour.We had chosen a Sauvignon blanc/Semillon from Australia to go with the food, which was lovely and at 88 S$ one of the cheapest choices on the extensive and expensive wine list. We found that the wine in general was overpriced but since we hadn't splurged on food for some time we decided to treat us to it - this however being the reason for 4 stars instead of five, as it really blew us away.Service was very good and professional, and consistent throughout which has become somewhat of a rarity these days, unfortunately.This place is perfect if a celebration is in order - actually there were two local parties celebrating a birthday complete with cake and candles :-).We will certainly be back some day for their excellent Italian food (the executive chef is Italian) and perfect service.",

Authentic cheese and real high quality smoked bacon (not your ordinary kind) I think the lunch set menu is also really reasonable, I think something around $40 and looks like a good deal.",

From the moment we entered, we were greeted with a jovial waiter and a complimentary plate of cheese and olives as we waited for our table to be ready. Just a few minutes later we were guided to our table and sent a complimentary appetizer and some of the best bread I've ever had.

Am glad I kept it for my Birthday!What I Loved: The decor is nice. Service is really good too. We sat at the bar area - at one of the tables - as we wanted to have drinks and finger food. The staff paid quite a lot of attention to us. I ordered an Apricot Brandy & 7-Up which was great. For our finger food, we got the Bruschetta al Pomodoro & Calamari. My fave was the dessert, Tortino Caldo al Cioccolato ($18), Molten Lava Chocolate Cake with Hazelnut Gelato & Raspberry Coulis.What I Don't Love: The prices are pretty rough though. Just finger food, 3-4 drinks & dessert came up to like $138? But it's a pretty high end place so that's expected.",

The menu entices people with its authentic Italian cuisine and ingredients that have been imported from Italy. I tried 2 dishes there, both of which I am very satisfied with - Osso Buco Con Risotto (braised veal shank with saffron risotto) and Linguine with Crabmeat and Vodka Sauce. The spaghetti was marvelous, proving the high standards of this Italian restaurant as the pasta was cooked to al dente and tossed in a flavorsome tomato-based sauce with a touch of alcohol. The Osso Buco Con Risotto stole the show, with the braised veal shank so tender and succulent. The creamy and rich risotto perfectly complemented the savory veal. The standards of this restaurant are heightened by its impeccable service. The staff was warm and friendly, and not to say attentive and accommodating when taking our orders.",
