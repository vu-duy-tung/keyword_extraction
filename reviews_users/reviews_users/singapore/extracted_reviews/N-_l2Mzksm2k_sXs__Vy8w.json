    "text": "This is a review of lunch with a colleague at Chat Masala.My colleague suggested Chat Masala for one of our lunches.tinyurl.com/bc55xzoThe ambiance is relatively basic but has a modern feel with clean lines. The tone of grey selected provides a cool feel to the room.tinyurl.com/b9ve3ngOn this day, the restaurant was almost entirely empty. \u00a0I have a feeling they do much of their business for dinner. \u00a0Their food and service are certainly of the quality level of a dinner destination.The service was friendly, professional, polite and timely. \u00a0This was the case through-out the meal.The food ranged from very good to extremely foodtinyurl.com/atdrs7pSamosa and Pakora - These were the appetizers. \u00a0Both were very good. \u00a0They were crispy and flavourful, \u00a0The filling for the samosas was just right, tender with near perfect seasonings. \u00a0Both dishes were very well presented.tinyurl.com/ath8udxtinyurl.com/bau2jq9Fruity Naan/Garlic Naan - The naan was fresh and tasty. \u00a0I had never tried fruit naan. \u00a0It actually kind of reminded me of my mom's fruit cake. \u00a0Their naan was very good. \u00a0I thought the garlic naan could have used just a tad more garlic though.tinyurl.com/avy7g37Rogan Gosh - This was a very well prepared lamb dish. \u00a0It is one of the best rogan gosh's I've had recently. \u00a0The spices really came together, \u00a0The lamb was well prepared. \u00a0This was an all around nice dish.tinyurl.com/aktm6g4Chicken Masala - What's not to like about tender pieces of chicken in a wonderfully flavoured sauce. \u00a0I wish there had been just a tad more chicken. \u00a0It would have made it a little fairer in the sharing of the dish. \u00a0But outside of that, this was a extremely good Chicken Masala. \u00a0The spice blend was so nicely balanced.tinyurl.com/a6vxc5bPilaf Rice \u00a0- This was very good rice. \u00a0It may have been just a tad bit on the dry side but the way it came together more than made up for this. \u00a0This was another dish with a very appetizing presentation.tinyurl.com/ay9cvcxReceipt ($61.50)This is not your average lunch and it doesn't come with an average lunch price-tag. \u00a0But I think the food was well worth it and I would not have an issue paying \u00a0the same price again for the same food. \u00a0Plus, we ordered two apps, two naans, two mains, rice, and beverages. But, at around $15 per, this is near the high end for mains in Indian restaurants.tinyurl.com/bg5any9Overall - A nice space, very good service, and great food all come together for a very enjoyable lunch. \u00a0Chat Masala could also easily make it as a choice for dinner with friends or a casual date. \u00a0When it comes down to it, every dish they served was well presented and, more importantly, tasted wonderful.",

    "text": "OH DAT NAAN. Them be delicious naan. I don't know how to make naan unfortunately, so I'm coming here for those tasty tasty flatbreads. If you like naan, come get some here. But of course that's not the only thing that's good here. I'm going to tell you to have the Kerala meen curry. It sounds funny, and it's certainly a mean curry - generous chunks of mackerel in a piquant gravy. Then there's the eggplant strips. I've loved almost every rendition kathirikai pachadi I've ever tasted, and this is pretty damn awesome. A deep reddish paste with eggplant strips... cooked in, and smothered in this sauce that is at first sweet, then after two bites, fiery, but oh so delicious... aiyah just come and eat lah.",

    "text": "This place is expensive. There, I've got the bad bit out. And aside from the high price point, I love Chat Masala. The decor is tasteful and soothing, and the service is top notch. Even the cutlery is of good quality - heavy and wrought into a pretty design. The menu is great, and I'll go for the usual fish masala, butter chicken, aloo gobi and palek paneer together with a stack of naans. The fish is moist and juicy, butter chicken creamy, and aloo gobi mildly spicy and the palek paneer finger licking good. The naans are biggish, crisp and fluffy, and everything is great - even the biggish slivers of ginger sabotaging some of the dishes - until I receive the bill. Then my heart constricts a little, but I willingly part with the dough because I'm happily stuffed.",

    "text": "Elegantly decorated with dim lighting, Chat Masala exudes the slightly expensive, charming neighbourhood specialty restaurant vibe. With many North and South Indian dishes from the more famous such as tandoori to the less well-known, the menu caters to all kinds of people of all ages. For those who are not as good with spice, the butter chicken is creamy and delicious which comes with the perfect sauce to go with the variety of naans offered. For dessert, the carrot cake is quite unlike many carrot cakes I've tried in Singapore and served delightfully warm. The mango kulfi is also highly recommended, a small home-made pot of ice-cream that is undoubtedly sinful.The service is also exceptional. We are always greeted warmly and there is a cozy feeling that is a result of the combination of beautiful decor, homely dishes and a friendly atmosphere. It is a lovely place to have lunch or dinner with friends or family and you will probably want to be back for more.",

    "text": "My first taste of butter chicken was here and it has been at least 6 years since I first patronised. Chat Masala is a family favourite, and it pleases everyone in my very big family ranging from 5 years only to 50 years old. The food here is good and that's the least of it. With a charming interior of organza curtains to partition the washrooms form the main dining area, Chat Masala is cozy and easily noticeable from the main road. The menu has expanded over the years, but only to the patrons' benefits. The Mamma Mia Mussels are a great dish to share, with a great balance of heat, sweetness and savouriness. The fish vadais are good; soft filling with chunks of fish with a crusty batter that can't seem to keep you away from taking another and another. Also, if you are wary about the vegetable dishes, and do look spinach and cheese, you have to try Palak Paneer, my all time favourite done right here at Chat Masala. The spinach is creamy and well seasoned, without a raw taste to it, and the cottage cheese is soft with a slight chew, going very well with pilaf rice if you like your rice flavourful as well.Finish off with their mango kulfi, thick, rich and creamy, you may just need a partner-in-crime to polish that little undaunting pot of ice cream.",

    "text": "I am quite a fan of North Indian food, so when my friend recommended for us to come here for dinner, I immediately jumped at the opportunity.The entire place has a very nice d\u00e9cor and ambience. Service was prompt, and we managed to grab a seat and made our orders quickly. Some of the food that we ordered included Chicken Masala, Fish Masala, Fish Briyani, Masala Tea and probably some others that I forgot. The briyani was nice, but I thought that the texture of the rice was not what I had liked. Oh, we also had butter chicken, and I thought that the gravy was really addictive! It's just too bad that the chicken was a little tough; I would have given it top marks if the chicken had been a little more tender. The naan here is amazing though; it's warm and fluffy, but crispy at the bottom. Simply perfect.Overall, this is a decent place to have North Indian food, but to be honest I've had better experiences elsewhere.",
