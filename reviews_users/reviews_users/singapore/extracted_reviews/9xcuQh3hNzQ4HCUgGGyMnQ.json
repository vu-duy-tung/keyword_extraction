However it is not cheap, we paid $90 for 2 meals and 2 drinks. The alcohol was also expensive (not sure if it is just I'm used to it being cheap or not). I got the vegetable fajitas. It was a big serving and tasted delicious, I recommend.",

Fine, 40 mins later were offered space at the bar so decided to eat there. Long story short, we would've been better off at McDonald's. The food here was decent but so ridiculously priced. $200 for 5 of us. The bartenders had absolutely no urgency, I had to ask for the check 3 times and was never offered a refill or checked on how the food was, nothing. & lastly, the music totally sucked.",

Totally Waikiki but in Singapore. Stay. Away. Forever.) We try to eat at HRC any place we go and we'd already been to the one we shall not name, and decided to re-do our experience. The personality of the staff wasn't amazing, but they didn't seem to hate their jobs either, and that's nice.Our food was HOT. We got the jumbo platter in which we devoured all of it. It was clearly fresh and super delicious. I probably could have just eaten one of those.I got the satay burger, which was excellent, but I couldn't eat all of it. It was great and I would definitely recommend someone to to the HRC Sentosa if a typical HRC Experience is what they're looking for.I finally got my magnet, and a tee shirt :)",

My wife is vegetarian and the menu is relatively vege friendly which helped. Friend and I ordered classic burgers (medium and medium rare) while my wife ordered a kale salad. Everything was extremely salty, including the salad, and the burgers were clearly frozen patties that would never be able to achieve medium doneness. I admit we finished the food (as mentioned above, we were starving) Mentioned to the waiter that everything was super salty, even the salad, and he comes back to say that the kitchen says that we ordered a salty salad, which is bizarre to me. I understand the concept of supply and demand, especially on a tourist island, but I'm totally shocked that hard rock can't even get a burger right. Spend your money elsewhere.",

    "text": "Going to Hard Rock Cafe almost makes me feel like a tourist, even if it is simply in Sentosa. Hard Rock Cafe has been on Earth for as long as I can remember and I enjoy trying out the Hard Rock Cafes in the different countries I visit. Awhile ago, a friend from school decided to visit me in Singapore and as she was a tourist and I felt like being one, we went to Hard Rock Cafe for dinner. It is not very different in design from other Hard Rock Cafes. It is dark inside with a bar area and loud music. Apparently there is live music on some nights, but there wasn't any the night we went. The food though was very different. Serving sizes are definitely smaller than those overseas, or at least those that I'd been to. We ordered the Hickory smoked Bar-B-Que Combo with ribs, chicken and smoked pulled pork since we couldn't make up our minds. It was beyond disappointing when we took our first bites and the meat was dry. The BBQ ribs were covered with a thick layer of sauce but the flavour had not even begun to enter the meat. I've had much more appetizing smoked pulled pork and the overall look of the dish was all the more unappetizing. The food looked like it had simply been thrown on the crowded plate and the sauces mixed with each other. Perhaps it is because I had expected much more from Hard Rock Cafe that has led to such disappointment. We decided to round off our meal with cocktails. It was the first cocktail my friend has ever had and she said that she probably would not have another one again. Given the rather expensive prices, I probably would not visit this Hard Rock Cafe again especially since I can get better American food elsewhere.",
