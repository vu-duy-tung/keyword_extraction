    "text": "Dropped by after a huge downpour to find a really cosy setup manned by one half of the partners, Gwen. She was alone managing the cafe that has 5 people including us who just walked in. She set us down very nicely whilst continuing to prep a sandwich for the other customer. After serving that customer, she took our order of coffee and went about preparing our drink, using the Brazilian bean that we chose out of the 2 offerings (the other being a Sumatran). Not once did she showed any haste or panic to deliver and we were extremely impressed especially when a little 2 year old (there-about) gal threatened to wreck the entire cafe apart with her wilful behaviour, with her dad being a slave to her actions. And not surprisingly, she spilled the dad's entire cup of iced mocha all over the floor but Gwen simply went about to coax the little girl from crying, etc. Full thumbs up for her immaculate service. Extra brownie points for the not-too-sweet banana cake that she somehow managed to baked whilst all these drama was unfolding in the shop.Hopefully they will start roasting in house soon and will drop by again for another cuppa.Parking is easy but watch the clock ticking as it's gantry-cashcard based.",

Worth the longer than normal wait. Seats could be more comfortable (got sore waiting for food to arrive), perhaps some cushions would help?Recommended for take away coffee or lazy weekend brunch (byo cushions).",

    "text": "Situated at the front of the old badminton complex, the cafe is easily located just 6 minutes away from Mountbatten MRT. Despite a decent seating capacity, the cafe was rather crowded when we visited on a weekday afternoon. Though spacious, the small square shaped metal chairs are not ideal for a long afternoon of chilling. What made the visit worth it was the coffee. I ordered the flat white ($5) and the cold brew ($7.80) as well as the raspberry coconut cake ($7.70) and the coffee walnut cake ($7.30). While the cold brew and cakes were average, what stood out for me was the flat white. Creamy with distinct fruity notes, it was the perfect combination one would demand from a cuppa. While not the best place for intense mugging, Brawn and brains is undoubtedly second to few when it comes to brewing the perfect cuppa and would make a great place for catching up with friends or that casual afternoon tea.",

Feels roomy and love the natural light. Earl Grey croissant warmed up and a single shot caffe machiatto. Overall impressed. Great coffee flavor. Strong and tasty which is how it should be, in my opinion. In general, I am overall impressed with Singapore and its norm of using earl grey which is one of my favorites so seeing cafes use it in baked goods and pastries is so awesome! Love it. That being said, the croissant was yummy warmed up. I think the icing was a bit much making it a tad too sweet. But I still enjoyed it. I like that they roast their own coffee and all their pastries are made in house. The service was welcoming and friendly. Overall, if I'm in the area again, I'd stop by :) Tip: you have to purchase your own bottled water Tip2: it didn't look like there was wifi or charging available but it could be a nice place to study and/or just chill",

Both were phenomenal. The single-origin is an amazing coffee...the flavor is very complex and delicious. I liked it a lot more than the house blend coffee. The croissant was also great. It was moist and flaky and you could really taste the Earl Grey. Once we did sit down (pretty uncomfortable sitting unfortunately), we ordered the molten eggs. So good. Cheesy, crispy, very filling, and flavorful. The spinach on the side is crisp and all of the side veggies go really well with the eggs. It's a creative and eggcellent (ha) dish unlike anything I've ever had for brunch.",

This cute little cafe is away from any competition (compared to the densely populated cafes in Tiong Bahru or Tanjung Pagar area) and just a stone throw away from my current office. You can easily missed this place if you're here for the first time, so look out for their banner hung outside the association and just follow the sign. The cafe is located at the back of the building, btw. We came here for lunch one weekday and love everything about this place. The owner, Gwen is friendly and always so welcoming with her warm smile. I ordered a latte and was asked which coffee blend I prefer. Since it was my first time, I asked for a recommendation and they recommended an African blend with a hint of chocolate and citrus. Very nice. Also, all coffee comes in double shot, which is slightly too strong for me. \u00a0I had a slight \"heart attack\" the moment I finished my coffee and had to dilute the caffeine with a lot of plain water. Haha. It could be the main draw why people come for their coffee - for it is strong! The food menu could be limited but I salute caf\u00e9 that concentrates on a few items and do it right and B&B is one of them. I had a chicken and mushroom grilled Panini while my colleagues had curry chicken Panini. All food is prepared fresh upon order hence the waiting time of 15-20 mins. But that's alright, nobody wants to eat frozen or food that has been sitting in the refrigerator for days. The chicken and mushroom as well as the curry chicken filling for the Panini were flavorful paired with a handful of fresh rockets. Portion wise, it was just right as it leave you with some space for dessert. We ordered a dark chocolate tart to share to finish off the meal nicely.  B&B together with a couple of cafes like DOC and Drury Lane will remain my favorite and foresee myself coming back again and again.",

The large windows bathe the space in natural light and the space owes everything to the prevailing hipster look.But the comforts end there.Stealing from fast food outlets who prefer a fast flow of customers, Brawn and Brains' stools are small and hard. The offered comfort doesn't promote a \"sit around and chat\" atmosphere.Brawn and Brains promote the a coffee conscious image. If all I cared about was image I could happily buy into this outlet. However I love coffee more than I love how it is housed. The coffee is so-so. Having lived around the Mediterranean for many years, I can't excuse a venue that doesn't include water with their coffee. Not only is coffee dehydrating and cloying without water, but the water helps clean the palate and keep the mouth fresh. Disappointingly Brawn and Brains didn't offer water immediately and refused to offer tap water. \u00a0The only option is imported water.The food is ok but was western themed. It was a little cliched with the dish coming with packet crisps. Very few local people were eating here, mostly Europeans and North Americans, presumably looking for a reminder of home. For a traveller in this area, why not just eat something local instead? There is a great selection of low price food and authentic cooking along Geylang road. Even \"The tuckshop\" up the road would be a better place to drop in.If I was looking for a coffee I would have wanted to head to Collective Brewers, but now they have closed down. Instead, I'd rather head to \"Curious Palette\" on Prinsep street, or, if I can get in, \"Space Mob\", at 8 Claymore Hill.",

    "text": "Nice cafe tucked in the corner of a parking lot right next to the Onsight climbing gym. This place is super small. The cafe can fit ~ 12 people comfortably and there is also a small table for outdoor sitting. I went there at noon and had to wait for a bit to get a table. I had the ice mocha, lemon tart and salted caramel tart. I am not a big coffee drinker but the coffee tastes pretty smooth. The lemon tart has a good mix of sweetness and citric taste. I thought the salted caramel tart is far too sweet. All in all, good place to chill out and have coffee and desserts. 10 mins walk to the circle line.",

Not enough seating though, could do with a few more spots and maybe some comfier chairs? Heheheh... Besides that it's a sweet lil' coffeeshop that is decorated nicely, there's not that much to write home about. Nothing too amazing in my opinion. Although I haven't tried the food yet so maybe the food is the hidden gem?",

A big spacious place but the seats are not the least bit comfortable.As the space is very bare sound really bounces off and it can get rather loud inside. It was rather disappointing to see that the teas they serve is tea bag tea ( a mention of that would have been good).",

    "text": "With all the rave reviews I don't understand just a 4 * rating. For me, anyway, it's 5 all the way. Yes the spot is (was - expanded space opening soon) tiny, but that doesn't detract from the quality or experience overall. You're greeted upon entering, served with a smile, and thanked on your way out. Even if the coffee and food wasn't that great it would still be a pleasant experience. But the coffee and food IS great. Limited food menu, but I prefer quality over quantity. I get the chicken and mushroom wrap or roast beef sandwich with a coffee and am always pleasantly satisfied - good, reliable, quality. Add a pastry for dessert if you're still hungry. And if there are no seats left, have your coffee to go and take a seat in the climbing gym next door to watch the action. I have nothing but praise for this place!",

    "text": "Dozens of cafes and how many of them have any character? A very very low proportion. But Brawn & Brains is absolutely buzzing with it. The team behind this cafe obviously care a lot about the way it looks & feels.The coffee was also excellent - easily one of the best cups I've had in Singapore. I neglected to ask exactly who roasted it but I will definitely be back to try some more. Unfortunately the location is a little out of the way but Guillemard Road is close enough to where I live to make it worth a trip out.The star gets knocked off for the uncomfortable seating. I get that you're a hole in the wall serving only drinks & pastries but that's still no excuse for trying to force patrons out by way of uncomfortable seating. Having said this, Brawn & Brains is the only place I've ever hesitated on before taking the one-star backless-seating demerit. And that says something.",
