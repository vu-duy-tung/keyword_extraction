    "text": "Awesome dinner with humongous proportions.I ordered a set meal - the sukiyaki that came with 5 pieces of sliced marbley beef, 2 watermelon slices, a salmon sashimi dish, rice and udon with eggs on the side.I once mentioned when you're at ichiban, its always good to share. \u00a0Now that I'm smarter, I convinced my friend to share with me. But of course greed took over and we ordered a kaisen salad and NEARLY over ordered with chawanmushi.Struggled we did but we conquered our dishes.The food was lovely though I felt the soup base was a tad too sweet but the beef was then winner of the day!Woo hoo!",

    "text": "This is news to me, but apparently different Ichiban Boshi outlets have a signature dish that they specialise in, BESIDES sushi. The outlet in Parkway Parade focuses on Kyoto Katsu.Knowing the quality of Ichiban Boshi, I wasn't expecting mindblowing katsu, but for some reason I was really curious about how it would turn out, especially since they have a larger, separate menu that hypes it up, AND they mention the Kyoto Katsu on their signboard outside.I ordered the Kurobuta Hire Katsu, and it was on the pricier side at $17.90. The meat was, dare I say it... a little mushy. It tasted fine, though. The panko flakes were a bit too coarse and I would have preferred finer flakes, but that is just me being nitpicky.Overall, not a bad choice for katsu, and one thing I really liked was that they were very generous with the rice. I'd still go to Katsuya on East Coast Road for my fix, but this one's a-ok if you've got a craving.",

    "text": "This particular location of ichiban boshi is located at parkway mall. It is also PACKED with customers for dinner, so if you're feeling Japanesey for dinner, I would plan on going to a different location (i.e. centerpoint--way less crowded). I like that the menu is so extensive because I always have a hard time deciding what to order. In most cases, I will walk into a Japanese restaurant wanting sashimi or sushi with salad or chawanmushi and an entree. At Ichiban Boshi, I can have that. The \"add on\" option to the ala carte items allows you to order a particular entree and then choose what kind of things you want to \"add on\" for a very reasonable price. If nothing on the ala carte menu tickles your fancy, they also offer \"sets\" that come with a whole range of small dishes. My favorite is the Sukiyaki set. I love the sukiyaki broth and if you're in need of more broth, it is super easy to get an extra bowlful from the waiter. It also comes with salmon sashimi, miso soup, rice, egg, cold tofu and fruit. The sets come out on huge trays to acomodate all the small dishes of this and that, so don't try to squeeze onto a table with a large party. Sushi is also ala carte, so you can order sushi items as appetizers. As it can get hectic at this location of Ichiban Boshi, service isn't always the best and the chaos aded to the fact there there are so many gosh darn plastic plates makes for loud accidents at times when the servers drop things.....awk. But in all, I've had good experiences here and would recommend it, especially if you come during non-peak hours.",

    "text": "One of those functional spots to have ok Japanese fare when the craving arises. Dishes are executed well in a consistent manner, though it doesn't always translate into superb. Good, but not great, though that's satisfying enough. I always come across Japanese at this establishment, so I suppose it's where they head to when they feel a little homesick. My favorite picks are the pumpkin croquette with spicy dipping sauce and tenzaru chasoba. So good! The croquette is panko-ed and deep fried to a golden coin, and breaking it open reveals a soft, sweet, sunny orange interior. It's my must have on every single visit. And the soba? With the weather sweltering nine times out of ten (and SUPER sweltering on the tenth), I usually hanker for a cold, light meal to eliminate the heat, stickiness and general grossness. Here's where the chasoba hits the spot. Icy noodles dipped into a light soy broth garnished with seaweed, spring onions and wasabi... mmm... A side of tempura-ed stuff accompanies the cold noodles - medley of prawns and assorted vegetables of the day that could include lotus root, sweet potato, lady's finger or even mushroom, depending on the chef's whimsy. Service is prompt, no complaints here. Together with the satisfying fare, it explains the queues that are always present, much to my chagrin.",
