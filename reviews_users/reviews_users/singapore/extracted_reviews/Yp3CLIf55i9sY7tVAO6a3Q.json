    "text": "The Spanish tapas wave has hit Singapore for some time and Australian Chef Luke Magan, who opened Salt at Ion Orchard, launched his Salt tapas & bar to give his Australian take on Spanish cuisine. The place is headed not by him but by his executive chef Tom Wells, who will still most likely be the one in charge of your food as he was seen around the restaurant that evening.The Traditional Garlic Roasted Flatbread ($6) came highly recommended. The bread topped with grains of salt did not disappoint though the black charred lines contributed bitterness. However the Romesco sauce was mild and tasted like pureed tomato. would prefer violet oon's chilli crab pita though.We also had Salted Cod Croquettes ($20) , \u00a0Wagyu Sausage,soft polenta,capers and tomato ($14) and desserts. Quantity small but at least you are assured that what goes into your mouth and stomach is good quality food.",

The only dish we didn't like was the one the magazine said was a must-try... the pumpkin dish.Everything else was out of this world.. the pork belly was especially fantastic. I liked the ambiance of the restaurant, nestled in a little corner in the middle of a bustling and VERY busy shopping area. It's almost like a little escape from the hustle and bustle of reality to duck into this little food haven.Our experience was also enhanced as it started monsooning like CRAZY the moment we sat down right until we finished our meal.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it's a tad pricey here! I've never heard of Luke Mangan before but he's alright in my books... I ended up trying his glass braserie restaurant in the Hilton Sydney after learning about him here and wasn't disappointed.",

No reservation walking at 7.30pm , I was very lucky to get the last table available outside. \u00a0What followed over the next hour and a half was a fantastic experience. The tapas selection is very modern Australian inspired, influences in particular from the Middle East. Service was fantastic, our waiter recommend many items to us and justified why we should try them. He obviously knew his stuff, and you could tell he had eaten and loved what he was recommending. What then was served to us all could not be faulted.Rocket, walnut, Spanish blue cheese and dukkah salad, was bold, interesting and magically worked so so well together. Cured kingfish with feta and ginger is one of Luke's signatures and one of those items I automatically order when Im in one of his restaurant. The flavor combination works so well, its just a great dish weather and starter in one of his more formal restaurants or this tapas bar. Desserts where great, egg tart with rhubarb sorbet!! Dang it was good. Food fantastic!!, service too, I shall be back for sure soon.",

Food : Love love love the Sumac spiced veal and pork meatballs ... very juicy and had a good bite to them. The arancini, i.e. fried risotto balls filled with mushroom were also really addictive while the crispy baby prawns with garlic aioli though quite good, were a bit prickly on consumption. G also really liked the wings and we managed to snag a few pieces of this awesome beef dish they were handing out ... not too sure what it was though. Friends also quite liked the oysters though I'm not personally a fan of molluscs. Luke kept plying us with chocolate hazelnut tarts and churros with chocolate ... I quite like the latter though girl friends preferred the former. Sangria was great! Very well mixed ... so much so that a teetotaler like myself didn't feel the effects until quite a few glasses later *hic*. Ambience : Warm, friendly and cheerful. Good for a night out.Service : Pretty good. Alastair is a star.Overall the dishes were quite decent but nothing really revolutionary ... guess I was more impressed by Foodbad Dada as the offerings were a bit more unusual. Salt was more contemporary Australian than Spanish.",

We decided to sit at the alfresco section where we had a barrel for a tabletop and high stools for our bums. That gave us a good view of the Raffles hotel minus all that Cityhall crowd. The food is an Australian style tapas with Middle Eastern and North African influence. There are only a few dishes reminded us of Spanish tapas e.g. Chorizo and Iberico ham. That was pretty fine with us since our main course was in fact the sangria and the food was just to prep our tummies for the drinking ahead. :)Love the fish bowl of sangria which only costs $70. We had 5 glasses each and that was only half a tank. Super worth it.The tapas were great too though it's a little small sized. Soft shell prawns with chilli and garlic aioli, beef tongue and wagyu sausage were fantastic.",

They were at the table in seconds flat whenever we needed something.)Went there yesterday and it was cool enough to sit outside, food came in minutes, wasn't a large crowd, and everything was good, and perfection, and happy. Tip: Try the sourdough toast for $3... it is TO DIE FOR.",

    "text": "Haven't heard of the talented Chef Tom Wells who works with Luke Mangan at Salt grill & Sky bar (Ion shopping mall) before Salt Tapas opens in May? The extension of the Salt brand brings about a sharing concept which is becoming a trend in the food scene of Singapore. Watch Tom whipping his magic wand behind the stoves in the open-kitchen, separated by the bar counter in the dining hall. His cheeriness and animated body language never goes into hiding, even when this pixyish chap dropped a pan on the kitchen floor. Projecting itself prominently at the North entrance next to Timberland store, this triangular prism red brick house exhibit a carefree chic ambiance. Clad in raw brick walls and a touch of green with indoor wall planters, this causal joint is decorated in antique lightings and peppy furnishing. Greeted by the vibrant wait staff at the entrance, I get to choose either the indoor main dining room, the bar area or the outdoor. The main dining room was jam packed even during early dinner time. I am quite in luck to get a sofa seat at this hour (reservation is only available for lunch while dinner for less than 8pax is on a first come first serve basis). I figured the crowd came for the happy hour which starts from 4:30pm - 7pm on weekdays. So, be sure to come early for a table. \u00a0 \u00a0 Some may find the bar-restaurant boisterous. Most of the time, the conversation went barely audible within the echoing background. Even so, I still find this Spanish vibe terrain habitable, not ear-piercing. Willingly, I'd trade some quiet moment for a few high quality flavor-driven tapas foods.To appease everyone's hunger, I picked some carb-plates to nibble at. The Roasted garlic flat bread goodness is worth beyond $6.00. This chargrilled flatbread is not entirely collapsed but thick. One still get to chew the soft slightly leavened texture while not missing its mild garlic tone. The most sought after small bites; Parmesan & truffle French fries is highly distinguished. These shoestrings are so addictive although it looked greasy, it is free from any awful gasoline after taste. The strings are evenly salted and come with some crisp ends. The baby chicken is the winner. Surely you wouldn't want to miss if you are a big fan of this suckling bird. Each part is grilled perfectly til the layer of skin turned crisp, astonishingly retaining its juice and natural flavor without overly seasoned. The meat is tender and gentle to bite, I regret that the serving board is too small to hold more. Or Luke should consider giving diners an option to up-size the dish...aw.. Luke, who loves liquorice has been making this signature dessert for 17 years, which is served in all his Salt restaurant globally. I liked this frozen licoriced sabayon not because people waxed lyrical about it, but I adored its rich and creamy texture. Instead of finding it mawkish, the lime syrup with citrus segments cut through and balanced the taste. Yes, the anise-flavor is intense (thanks to the Pernod liqueur in the liquorice) but it is not absolutely unacceptable. Although it is the most recognized dish every where in the Salt restaurant, I wonder if I still did a bad thing by introducing it to my girls. Undeniably, the dessert is an acquired taste that evidently appeared offensive to them. To atone for my mistake, I ordered a gooey hot chocolate tart for them. The tart is served warm with a crisp shell covering the soft and sticky chocolate fudge in the core. It can't go wrong with the sweet caramelized banana slices but it was made better by the accompanied peanut butter ice cream but dehydrated form. Everyone at the table got into a state of nirvana and who was to say the dessert was no good?And if you have not been to the place, make a date to visit and check out the inspirational tapas delights which Tom helps to showcase. Get soaked in the playful atmosphere - an exlir to a worn out torso. Do note that no reservations is available for both lunch and dinner during the Formula 1 weekend; 21-23/Sep, 2012.",

    "text": "I am wavering between giving this joint a 3 or 4 stars, but finally decide on a 3. I did not know Salt Tapas & Bar is under Luke Mangan of Salt Grill & Sky Bar when we went there for some drinks and bar bites. It was after 830 pm when we got there and snagged a table outside. The service was so-so. Good when you managed to get hold of someone, bad because had to wait a while before someone noticed you are ready to order. The recommended sangria was spot on. I asked for something not too bitter and the server suggested a white wine base sangria which just hit the spot. A jug for 2 was probably too much as I got a bit tipsy after just 2 glasses or so (they keep refilling the glass even though it was not empty).Food we shared:Chorizo - it was good but nothing to rave about. I mean, what could go wrong with sausage?Truffle fries - this I like. yummy tasty truffle smell with crispy fries.Calamari - lightly battered and crispy calamari which was not rubbery. Nice. Maybe I did not order enough to get a better gauge of the food, but it was pretty much ok but nothing that blew me away.",

The a/c inside created this breeze since the window was open and the hot air was pulling it. Great place to grab drinks and hang out. Perhaps the historical bar across the street gets all the traffic but i hear this spot is still new in comparison to the other establishments. I like how they have an spherical ice option. It doesn't melt as fast as the traditional cubes. Alcohol menu is robust and the price wont kill you. Perhaps my next visit I will make some time to try the food.",

The fare at the revisit was improved, and the management evidently took our feedback at the tasting to heart. It's now really yummy, and a worthwhile option for brunch eggs!We had these at the revisit, paid for on our own:1) Eggs Berendine ($14): while this was unexciting, it was executed flawlessly. Perfectly runny insides, velvety hollandaise spiked with a dash of paprika, a generous lashing of bacon lardons, wilted spinach, and buttery muffins all came together cohesively. 2) Scrambled Eggs ($15): nicely finessed, with eggs scrambled commendably, and dressed with a mildly spicy ratatouille and zucchini ribbons.3) Club Sandwich ($16): the magic of this delicious creation was the chicken mayo: crisp, clean, clear, delicate and refreshing. The cajun fries were memorably awesome.4) French Toast ($15): The thick fluffy brioche, dunked in a thin eggy coat and fried, was already stellar, and when paired with Okinawa ice-cream, clotted cream, jam and a sprinkle of icing sugar, just glorious",

    "text": "If you have any sort of expectations when it comes to tapas then I beg you, go elsewhere. I treated myself tonight--my first night in Singapore--and I can't remember the last time I've felt so offended. The people working here would be better fit for Applebees. The jamon was served with toasted sourdough bread--no cheese--just under two ounces of poorly butchered jamon scattered haphazardly over a piece of slate for $29. One of the prep chefs was snacking as she assembled my cheese plate, which included the most unripened pear I've ever tasted. I had to stare down the woman at the bar every single time I had a request to the point where I felt like a predator, and it took three attempts with three other people to get the bill. Before all this, a guy sat down at the bar next to me and waited a solid ten minutes without anyone even making eye contact, so he got up and left. Had I paid more attention to the menu, I wouldn't have even bothered. Luke Mangan must have a laugh at what he's done, because this was the most poorly executed, least thought-out tapas menu I've ever encountered. Half of it is Morrocan, and it even ventures into southern/southeast Asian. Whatever, I'm cool with fusion, but tapas is about simple, uncomplicated plates that are flawlessly presented. The reason I went here was the picture of the chocolate \"delice\" tart on their website, which was presented in the form of three slices of fudge, served with crushed and roasted peanuts and hazelnut ice cream. It was delicious, but not nearly compensating for the rest of the meal or horrible service. You can get by with the wine menu, but there are only 6 or 7 by-the-glass options.",

    "text": "Decided to go Espanol tonight and so with the help of Yelp, picked the Salt Tapas & Bar from the list. No regrets.For starters, we had the oysters served natural with Chardonnay sauce. You oysters were meaty and the white wine made it smooth. The beetroot salad was ok, that's because I'm not a bIg beetroot fan but ordered it anyway coz the rest of the family wanted to try. We also had the tapas with chickpea sauce...simply yummy. Will order that again should I go back the next time. The flatbread was not too heavy and one order could easily be shared by three,person.For mains, we had the specials for the night, a salmon pizza, grilled scallops and sirloin done medium-well. What can I say but these dishes were worth the price.Desserts...ah...who can resist the sweet selection. Had the churros with chocolate sauce and it was really out of the world. The churros has a way that melts in your mouth. Our other sweet order was the chocolate tart with ice cream. Great combinations. Must definitely come back again.",

Hahaha. The music played is really nice. Felt very comfy and was very much in the groove with the music, food, ambiance and service.What I Love: The food was amazing. It's not really traditional Spanish Tapas - there are certain Tapas options that are Spanish inspired - but most are Australian (with European/Moorish influences) served in Tapas - style - plate size. Tried their Anchovy bread Tapas - yummmy. Meatballs, yummmmy! Fish served tajine style - so yummy, I've never tried anything like this before. Chorizo - very, very yummmy. Pumpkin salad dish - really tasty and yummmy. We also ordered an olive dish which was standard, but good. Sangrias - so so so so yummmmmy!What I Don't Love: The prices are pretty steep.... so maybe keep this place for a special occasion! ;)",
