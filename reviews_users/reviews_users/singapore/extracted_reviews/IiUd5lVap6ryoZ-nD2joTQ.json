As we moved back to Europe there was no such thing as a Ruth's Chris Steak House and the restaurant became a story that my parents would tell us when we would talk about the best steak houses. While I planned my trip to Singapore with my family, I thought to myself, could it be that there is one in Singapore? I knew that they had opened one in Hong Kong and were opening a couple throughout Asia. To my surprise, I was right! In 2012 (I think) it had opened in Singapore. Without hesitation I made us a reservation. This place that I had heard so much about but couldn't remember from when I was small. I would discover it at last! Discover the steaks that melt on your tongue, the impeccable service, etc, etc... As our trip approached, I have to admit that I was becoming nervous. Could it really live up to those high standards I had put up in my head? Would I be inevitably disappointed?On the 3rd day of our stay in Singapore, the day had come. I will never forget walking in to the restaurant and being greeted by the Maitre D. Maybe it was because this place had become something so special to me that I thought it was the perfect restaurant and overall best dining experience of my life, but you can't deny that everything is simply perfect. From the steak to the service to the wine and even to the beautiful decor! Everything was just as I had imagined it. I don't want to spoil the experience as it is something everyone should see for themselves. Myself and my mother had the NY strip, my dad had the Rib-eye. I would recommend both of these options but it really depends on personal preference. A glass of red wine is a must for me and I would definitely suggest to take the \"Roasted Brussels Sprouts\" or \"Lobster Mac And Cheese\" for sides. I can't recommend this place enough! Yes, the prices are high but you won't be disappointed! I don't know when I will return to a Ruth's Chris Steak House the next time as I live in London but I am already looking forward to it.",

My party had three steaks and we all agreed this wasn't a Ruth's Chris experience. To the credit of the management they were very concerned that we didn't eat our steaks, offered to prepare others, and made some adjustments to the check.",

Fries were hot & delicious - salt level was just right albeit a little on the high side. Ordered a Moscato \"sparkling wine\" to go with my meal (I know, it's a dessert sweet wine - but I was thrown off by the \"sparkling wine\" tag in the wine list). Pricey at $23 & served in a tiny glass (almost like a champagne flute). This wad not hood value, and yes I know it's how F&B establishments make money.Service was spotty. 1/2 the waiters were aloof & could not be bothered. We were 2/3 way thru our meal when our waiter came up to us, asked \"how many coffees & teas\" (yes, he helpfully informed us it came with our set lunch). Seriously .. It wasn't even 3pm yet, & a real fine dining restaurant would NOT hurry their customers thru their meal.The other 1/2 were friendly & warm. Entertained our very active little toddler who was getting restless during our lunch.I'm not sure I would return; perhaps for lunch but most likely not for dinner. Unless someone else was paying ;)",

    "text": "My dad was talking about some Chris Ruth steak.. and I was all like \"????? but it can't be as awesome as Bedrock Bar & Grill's steak, dad.\" So he decided to prove me wrong and drag my brother and I to the place.. and the first thing I noticed was.. it's not Chris Ruth.. it's called Ruth's Chris. Secondly, it turned out to be quite a dressy place.. which I, in my jeans and tee-shirt, feel a little bit out of sorts.. as the location of this place is within the hotel. Thankfully, the waiters were kind enough to not judge. We ordered a variety of dishes, Caesar Salad (delicious), lambchops (not bad), roast potatoes and mashed potatoes side dish (I am addicted to their roast potatoes, a must try!) and of course, their steak. We had 3 plates of it.. in medium well. Firstly, the steak was served on a sizzling white plate. Yes, you heard me right, it was served on a ceramic white plate that is hot. That was interesting. Secondly, the color of the steak.. perfectly grilled. When we cut it, it was exactly like what we asked for. Medium well. Not too tough, not too bloody. Just nice. Thirdly, it tasted lovely, even without any condiments. So my dad was right, Ruth's Chris's steaks are good! The ambience of the place is akin to that of Lawry's sans the french maids prancing about with trolleys doing their twinkly dance with the spinning salad bowl. It's quiet, a good place to have a good chat with friends or your significant other. As the place is quite pricey, it is a good place to go to for a special occasion. I must say this place is definitely one of my to go places for steak in future. Do give it a try if you have the money or if you are simply craving for a good steak.",

    "text": "When I first heard that Ruth's Chris is gonna open a Singaporean branch, I jumped with joy. I went to Ruth's Chris a few times before when I was in the US and it was one of my favorite steakhouses.Before even biting into the steak, I was already pleased with how it looks like. Perfectly charred, served with that classic butter on top of a sizzling plate. I ordered the ribeye and my brother & his friend had the T-Bone for 2. Both were extremely good and a perfect representation of good ol' American style steak. It had to be mentioned though that the T-Bone beef was actually Australian.I was sad though, when I heard that they didn't serve shoestring potatoes. It was my favorite side dish in Ruth's Chris SF and on that note, if there is any letdown in this place, it is the side dishes. They were very mediocre and didn't do justice to the main dish.There was a slight difference between the Singapore branch and the US branch, but I won't fault them for it. (I'll post the pictures) I'd still give this place a 5 star for serving the best good ol' fashioned cowboy steak in this part of the world.",

    "text": "I really loved my dinner at Ruth's Chris, and my mates concur as well. The food was faultless, and I loved the traditional style of Ruth's Chris' steaks; unadorned save for salt, pepper, and a simple glaze of American butter. No sauces, herbs or seasoning to distract from the meat, so the quality of the meat is highlighted in its pure form, which I understand can be a little uninspiring for some diners. But one man's meat is another man's poison, so what's boring to others can also be construed as classic, and I like my stuff classic anyway.Service was gracious, if a bit spotty (our water glasses weren't refilled automatically).All in all, this is definitely going down as one of 2016's best eats. We had:1) New Orleans-styled Barbecued Shrimp ($35): a must-try, we actually ordered more bread to mop up that lovely spiced garlicky white wine and butter sauce.2) USDA Prime Ribeye ($85 for 12-ounce): a perfect medium-well. The corn-fed meat had ample heft, and imbued with a tantalizing char. Be sure to go down a cooked-level coz it'll continue cooking at the table3) USDA New York Strip ($85 for 12-ounce): fuller-bodied flavour than the ribeye, but just as sumptuous and robust.4) USDA Filet ($90 for 11-ounce): a leaner cut but incredibly tender and luscious.There are a good number of sides to break up the monotony of steak, and we liked:5) Sauteed Spinach ($20): clean, delicate, and simply fried with garlic.6) Potato Au Gratin ($20): laden with cream and burnished with cheddar melt. Rustic, old-school and hearty",

Now that they've finally arrived in Singapore, I've got another trusted and reliable joint to satisfy my meat cravings. It's definitely not cheap, but to compare it with Morton's (its closest competitor), I'd have to say that what you're paying for at Ruth's is almost equal to or even better than what you get at Morton's. Taste wise, I've got to say that its surpassed my wildest dreams and is exactly as how I expected it to be. Portions are huge and yet they've managed to prepare it perfectly. Definitely a must try for meat lovers.",
