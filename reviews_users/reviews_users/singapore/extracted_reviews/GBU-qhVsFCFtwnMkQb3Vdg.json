    "text": "A very special restaurant, high quality ingredients without some of the ostentation and pretentiousness that is typical of newer joints.We had a charcuterie platter, grilled hamachi collar, black mash and the deconstructed Tim-Tam for dessert. The lardo from the cold cut platter was especially good, as was the black mash. We also really enjoyed watching the Josper grill in action behind the kitchen counter. We were pleasantly surprised by the wines, as the selection is excellently curated. Ended up having a Merlot that well surpassed our expectations. Service was really good, despite it being really crowded on a public holiday eve. Overall, one of the best dining experiences in Singapore. Only annoying thing is how hard it is to find parking on Purvis St. Will be back for sure!",

We had the charcuterie platter, chicken hearts, wagyu, scallop ceviche, and kangeroo, finishing off the meal with their complimentary Anzac cookies.I really enjoyed the platter, with a variety of meats that they cured in-house, which is a rarity in Singapore. I suppose the humid climate doesn't help, making this quite an achievement I must say. The scallop ceviche, wagyu, chicken hearts and kangeroo were decent, but nothing to shout about. Very solid execution, nothing to complain about at all.I really enjoyed the cookies, \u00a0which were very crispy. Since they were complementary, I suggest you make room for them and keep them in mind when you order!",

Chef Andrew is very friendly and chatted and explained about the meats and dishes. \u00a0Opted for a watermelon and mint juice, highly refreshing. \u00a0The deserts, chocolate and peanut butter ice cream and \u00a0pearls were fabulous and the cookie with bacon finale was awesome! \u00a0I eat those before I had a chance to photograph!Overall, this is an Avant-garde restaurant at the creative cutting edge in Singapore and has MAJOR potential to be at the top end. \u00a0For my friends, SG yelpers and interested visitors/tourists, this is a must-try if you haven't \u00a0been already. Go with an open mind, and enjoy every bit, but remember, this is no chicken rice!!See pics.",

    "text": "Sort-of new kid of the block located along Purvis Street where the big boys' rules' - from fine dining establishments like Garibaldi Italian Restaurant and Gunther's to local favorites; Yet Con, Chin Chin eating house, Saveur among others. I really like Salted and Hung for its beautifully designed interior - spacious and not too dark, tongue-in-chic graffiti on the wall, background music that is not too loud but still entertaining at times, and of course the all-star team led by Chef Andrew Nocente, an Australian. The food and drinks menu is rather extensive, so I would suggest you go through one round and decide which to choose from each category. Here's the list of what we ate throughout the 4-hour dinner last night: - \u00a0Small Plate Sweetbreads - with cabbage, granola and saltbush ($10) Tripe (fried) - with tongarashi, Szechuan and caponata puree ($15)Chef's selection of charcuterie ($28)Crab - with uni, apple and asparagus ($25)Corn (roasted) - with spiced cheese, manchego and chives ($9)Kale (roasted) - with homemade cheese and nuts ($10)Burrata - with pickled tomato, basil oil and pine nuts ($12) Cauliflower -with burnt butter tahini, piccalilli and dandelion ($10)MainOP ribs - 1.2 kg of ribeye ($198)Iberico pork collar - with apple, nuts and mustard ($42)Roast chicken (half) - with beer sauce, house rub and black garlic ($22)DessertChocolate salami - with salted caramel and chocolate meringue ($16)Figs - with yogurt ice-cream, nasturtium and Pedro ximenez sherry ($14)Popcorn - with corn and raspberry textures ($10)Chocolate tart - specials. (forgot!)Anzac cookie - complimentary! It was a hearty meal for sure as we paced ourselves eating, talking and laughing away while the kitchen consistently churned out one dish after another. A few dishes I really like include roasted kale and corn, the iberico pork collar is out of this world and the desserts deserve a standing ovation to end a very satisfying meal. We don't get fresh figs here in Singapore so seeing it on the menu is something refreshing and \"exotic\" at the same time.  The total bill came up to $552 (without alcohol) to be shared among 5 people. Reasonable for the amount and quality of food we ordered. I'm definitely coming back to try out their lunch offerings one of these days or just walk in by myself for a treat to combat those dark, stressful days at work.",

Looking through the menu, I decided on the 3 course lunch set ($35++).Pork BellyApple, cucumber & mustardThe pork belly was cut up into small pieces, tasted quite juicy. The apple and cucumber shaved into thin slices made a very tangy side.Red SnapperDashi broth, fennel & sea herbsIt was steamed fish in light broth. The fish was firm and juicy, while the broth was light and flavourful. The thinly sliced fennel lent a citrus taste to the simple dish.PopcornRaspberry & popcorn textureIt was served in shades of pinks, but it was a different story in the mouth. Closed one's eyes, it was like butter popcorn which one usually have when watching movies, with popping effect in the mouth.I finished the meal with a cup of chocolaty latte and a piece of Anzac Biccies which tasted of bacon and salted caramel, totally different from the Anzac I used to have back in Australia.",

They weren't bad, but I find them not particularly flavorful even though the different ingredients seemed to be rather interesting and unique individually. Some of the dishes were also rather flat tasting, like just a touch more salt would have perked up the flavors more. The happy hour deal is good though 1-1 drinks and a few snacks for less than $10.",

    "text": "A very, very disappointing experience at Salted & Hung on Purvis St - formerly known as 5th Quarter at the Vagabond Hotel. I had desperately wanted this to be good as I had been wanting to go since its previous incarnation. The place itself has a nice casual, mildly edgy vibe and the staff were well-trained and knowledgable. However a) specials board was not visible and b) staff didn't explain the \"concept\" to us, I.e. Which were small plates, how many portions were recommended to order for 2 people etc. Ultimately, service and decor take a back seat to food and flavour for me and this is where S&H really fails to deliver.All the produce and ingredients were great quality and well-cooked, however were totally underwhelming in taste. Wagyu rib - sous vide and grilled, was very high quality and extremely rich but lacked any beef flavour. I was just aware that I was chewing on protein. The green sauce (\"Hulk sauce\") was actually unpleasant and reminded me of the smell of cut grass / wheatgrass juice. Crab and uni also didn't pack any punch. In fact there was no sweetness one would expect from crab meat. Burrata and tomatoes was a complete injustice to burrata. The head cheese and beef rillette, part of the house made charcuterie board, were excellent though. I thought the best part of the dinner were the free bacon and caramel Anzac biscuits that came at the end of the meal....Damage: $125 nett food onlyWe were in and out within an hour.",

Husband and I tried the Chef's Pairing Menu. Most of the food was excellent. The crisp bread that went with the charcuterie was excellent, loved the caraway seeds. I'm not a beetroot fan but my husband loves it so was a big fan of the beetroot tartare. The pork sausage was delicious and made me realise how much I miss good sausages. Next was the fish tail which looked amazing but was a bit dull. The last savoury dish was Wagyu tri tip and it was AMAZING. I could just eat plates and plates of this forever. Dessert was a peanut butter tim tam which was pretty tasty. The wine menu is decently priced and you can add a beer pairing to the dinner menu which sounds very interesting and which I may well try on my next visit. This is definitely one to add to your list.",
