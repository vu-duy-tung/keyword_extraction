I met a friend here and he reserved a table outside. \u00a0I got to the gardens a little early so that I could walk leisurely through it and was glad that I did. I allowed an hour but could have wondered about longer.We started by splitting the char grilled squid. It was perfectly made and delicious. The addition of pearl cous cous was perfect. Then we split the crab dip with shrimp crackers. We asked for more crackers and they arrived with a smile. It was good.Chili crab spaghetti is a must order, of course. Yes, it is worthy of the hype! Get it! Eat it! Crave it later!We also got the barramundi special which was out of this world delicious. I wish I could get that again or make it at home. Wow! Cocktails were equally delicious. The garden setting was so serene. Lighting low. Cool floor. Service great. I highly recommend this place. It is a little slice of heaven in a bustling city.",

Pros:- Easy to get a table quickly as a walk in- Right next to the Orchid garden- great dessert options- good service (depending on your server)Cons:- THEY DON'T HAVE HIGH TEA ANYMORE.I talked to one of the servers about this and she told me they got rid of it a bit ago and haven't updated their online information. It was pretty disappointing, but their banana bread dessert made up for it. It's not your average banana bread - it's an actual piece of bread with pieces of bananas, nuts, ice cream, and caramel drizzle on top. It's really good and you don't feel guilty eating it because you made a long trek through the garden for it. But if you want high tea, don't go there. sadness.",

    "text": "Tea (the event) is the best thing that the English have invented. Nothing beats whiling the afternoon away in the garden with buttery and crusty scones, clotted cream and jam. Best place to do it in Singapore? Try The Halia at Singapore Botanic Gardens, a romantic and picturesque restaurant tucked away in in the lush foliage centrally located in town.My frazzled nerves were soothed by the Chilled Halia Infusion, a lightly spiced tea sweetened with honey, while we waited for our tiered tea set to be served. You could pick other teas or brewed coffee as part of your set. I much prefered the chilled version over the hot one that i had during brunch the last time.Always start with the scone when doing tea. It kind of sets the tone for tea (that and you really should eat it when it's hot) and i knew i was in for a great time when i bit into the crusty and dense pastry slathered with chantilly cream and a tinge of orange ginger jam.There's a nice balance of sweet and savory bites in the tea set, which i alternated between. The Gorgonzola and caramelized onion quiche had an absolutely buttery tart with a light blue cheese filling. There's also the poached chicken and smoked paprika finger sandwich and the meh-ish Wagyu beef rendang samosa. The sweet plate consists of the delicious scones, the towering coconut panna cotta with mango, passion fuit and lychee. I quite enjoyed the moist carrot cake with cr\u00e8me cheese icing and certainly wouldn't mind seconds. I was impressed by the Ginger flower macaroon which had quite the perfect candy shell and slightly chewy center.For $28 per individual set, I have to say this is a steal for tea. I'll definitely recommend this for a tea party with the girls! Don't miss out on this lovely tea at The Halia, Singapore Botanic Gardens which is available every weekend and Public Holiday from 3 - 5pm. Reservations are not accepted for brunch and tea service though.",

For the Oyster fanatics, The Halia uses only the best Coffin Bay Oysters. Oyster done in tempura & ponzu - you get to taste the oyster well-cooked, which adds to a good bite. Very palatable and works with everyone. This was my favourite one!Oyster freshly-shucked - I thought initially thought this oyster was prepared with some sauce. In actual fact, it is so fresh, you even get the salted brininess from the sea, in a perfectly good way. You might want to unabashedly slurp this one up.Oyster with baby spinach, pernod, nutmeg & baked in parmesan gratin - A crowd favourite and a special by the chef.Round off your meal with the Hot Halia Infusion, a house specialty of sun-dried ginger & wild mountain honey from the A La Carte Menu to warm our bellies up after the meal. With medical properties, ginger tea is perfect to sooth the digestive system.",

    "text": "Attracted by the tantalizing brunch pictures on its website, it was slightly disappointing to find out that the trout salmon fillet(not the usual smoke salmon version) topped with poached egg and that velvety hollandaise sauce is no longer available. So we shared a couple of other brunch dishes.Caramelised banana walnut bread, vanilla mascarpone cream, kumquat compote and crushed hazelnuts: This requires 20minutes of waiting time but the taste of the bread (more like a light cake) was warm, moist and fresh so I think the wait is reasonable. The bananas were grilled nicely to give a subtle bitter caramelised flavour. The bread itself is choke full of walnuts which some people who dislike nuts may want to avoid but I guess having some walnuts are still beneficial to the brain The AmericanLike the previous one, the portion is good for sharing. Nothing spectacular but perhaps the only slight flaw is the overcooked poached egg. Not only was the egg yolk fully cooked, the egg white had a sharp tang of white vinegar. warm chocolate pudding white choc sauce(if you can spot) crushed pistachio orange flower ice creamIt was strange that they served an ice cream on a hot plate even though the chocolate pudding was supposed to be warm. The ice cream melted rapidly. This pudding is the steamed English version of fa kueh so perhaps the menu should have stated whether it is the creamy custard version or a cake version. The white chocolate sauce is also evidently very very little. Young ginger Nougat frozen parfait with roasted pineapple and spiced pineapple sauceNougat is not something common on a restaurant's menu and this one is worth trying since it has been the longest running dessert on it's menu according to the waiter. The use of coconut, ginger and pineapple highlights the Asian flavour and it's no wonder a hit especially for tourists. Special brunch item: almond orange cake with citrus sherbet and lemongrass panna cotta Another interesting Asian style dessert whose individual components are well balanced. Sour food lovers will certainly like the tangy sherbet. Service was friendly but the attentiveness can be improved. Nonetheless, it may be a decent dining place to go if you are looking for one that is located in a garden.",

It's the whole experience of walking through botanic gardens to get to the ginger garden and then dine at halia and then walking back out amidst all the lush greenery that you don't get very much in singapore.The service is also fantastic, they address you by your name if they've learnt it from your reservation. And once when my fiance ordered a fish dish wrapped in baking paper, the chef actually took the effort to come to our table and explain how to best eat the dish!One of the most memorable food I had here was the lavender creme brulee. It was the best brulee I've ever had, not overly sweet, melts in your mouth and fragrantly enchanting. Unfortunately, that was a special during a special occasion season (christmas if I'm not wrong) so its not on their regular menu though I wish it was!Their ginger drinks concoctions are also very refreshing, it's a must-order each time we patronize the place. But of course, you must love ginger the way I do!Final verdict: The place to impress the socks off your date - but he/she must enjoy taking a nice stroll in the park first!",

    "text": "I went to Halia over the weekend for Brunch. The food was very good but the real prize here is the setting. You can dine amoung lush tropical plants and then continue walking around Singapore's stunning Botanical Gardens. The prices are high (appatizers start around $25) but is still a great place to take a date or a small group of friends for intimate dining.",
