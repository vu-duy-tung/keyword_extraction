Unfortunately, we were all less than impressed. The food just lacked flavor vision for the food was just lost. Even our two vegetarians weren't impressed in the least. Out of everywhere in Singapore and more specifically holland village I would try something else.",

Then came the lasagna... omg... it was very very good considering it is a vegetarian version.The chocolate cake and ice cream as some of the reviewers had mentioned was heavenly. oh, and not to mentioned our 2 kids (2.5 years and 8 months) was with us, and we really appreciated the restaurant / waiter accommodated when we found my daughter loved the soup and we asked for an additional small serving. \u00a0They were very kind to oblige.overall we want to go back again to try out other offerings... Very high potential that this will be my wife's new favorite restaurant !",

    "text": "We used to come here (and its sister restaurant and neighbour Michelangelo) a lot when it first opened in the mid-90's, then stopped when more exciting Italian dining options became available 10 years ago. For some reasons, Original Sin has always attracted a heavily-expat client\u00e8le. It is interesting to note that the customer mix has changed from primarily European to primarily Indian, reflecting the changing expat community in Singapore. What has not changed? First, the d\u00e9cor, which now looks distinctly dated, down to the stains on the bench and chairs! Secondly, the food remains delicious, although one notices changes in the menu - maybe to accommodate new customer preferences? (They now serve veggie tandoori, and moved veggie burger out of the main menu). Prices are not high (especially the set lunch which is very good value). Service is knowledgeable and competent (unlike at the outlet next door). So, I guess we would go back here again!",

    "text": "Great location - two minutes walk from Holland Village MRT station.Came here on a Thursday night for date night, because I felt like a vegetarian dinner.I was pleasantly surprised, despite not knowing what to expect.We had the:1. Mezze PlatterA Middle Eastern platter with a selection of dips. Hummus chick pea dip, Aromatic pumpkin and carrot, Eggplant baba ganoush, Yogurt tzatziki, served with Falafel balls and ciabatta bread. (Summaries copied from the Original Sin menu)Oh my, this platter has amazing bread, freshly baked, and the hummus/eggplant were pretty darn awesome.2. Magic Mushroombaked Portobello mushroom with ricotta cheese, spinach, pesto, topped with a tomato basil sauce and mozzarellaI wanted an additional serving of this but my companion stopped me, because he wasn't sure about the size of our mains. Boohoo.3. Spanakopitabaked ricotta, spinach, feta and filo pastry served with grilled portobello and mixed vegetable ratatouilleQuite nice, but nothing special.4. Moussakabaked layers of char-grilled eggplant, potato, tomato and lentils, infused with middle eastern spices, topped with a white sauceI didn't like this because it was filled with lentils and tasted like a completely veggie lasagna. I would not order this again.I would come back, but maybe for the starters and different mains. We didn't have dessert here because they had a very small dessert selection and 2am was right opposite... But that's a separate review.",

Location is especially nice and quiet and not in a mall :-)The impression over the phone was a big let down thanks to an unfriendly lady taking the reservation. After we arrived at the place we were surprised by the nice interior but again the staff was not really welcoming without maybe one exception. Service is okay but nothing special .... And that's exactly what makes a restaurant different to others. Staff seemed not overly interested or charming. The mushrooms as starter were fantastic, calzone was average because of the dough. The other meals were good. Overall we enjoyed the evening thanks to the quiet atmosphere and having dinner outside a mall, but this place could be so much more with a few little improvements. We will anyway come again to try the rest of the menu. We would rate 3.5 if possible.",

    "text": "My meal at Original Sin was very enjoyable, but other than the fact that it was vegetarian and still awesome, it wasn't particularly memorable. If I could only eat vegetarian cuisine, or was dating someone that was vegetarian, or was vegetarian once a week, I'd probably rate this place 4 stars. But since vegetarian for me is a non-existence craving (I go when I want to really change things up, when I'm feeling very jaded, or very unhealthy), that makes Original Sin just A-ok. The Beetroot salad my companion and I shared was rather underwhelming. The salad snob that she is, she found the use of iceberg lettuce vaguely disappointing (the current online menu seems to indicate this has changed; it now says spinach instead of lettuce) and overall it just wasn't a particularly memorable salad, as salads go. Beetroot does not a star make unless it's been treated special or given a good supporting cast.The mains on the other hand, were delicious. The Spanakopita and Lasagna were both hearty, flavourful, absolutely addictive, and very filling. Just typing about it now is making me crave it. And considering I started writing this review over 6 months ago, maybe it's time to revisit Original Sin. Right after I satisfy my steak craving that is.",

Original sin perfectly suits the strip. Nice ambiance, relaxing vibes, good wine, service staff is well trained and properly dressed etc. Everything seems right... except for the food. That is just plain and boring. Even a little bit more salt would do wonders. Trying to cut back on meat myself, I hope Original Sin doesn't turn people away from dining out vegetarian. If you want to go vegetarian a better option is to order a risotto at da paolo ristorante or get a mushroom truffle pizza at da paolo pizzabar down the street.",

The restaurant feels very sophisticated and posh, and can come across as a little high cuisine rather than casual dining. I was definitely impressed with the d\u00e9cor and the ambience, and had high expectations of the food.The party I came with was certainly not let down by either the service or the quality of the food. The portobello mushrooms (or Magic Mushrooms) were juicy and flavourful, and we could not get enough of them. The Mezze Platter was also a instant crowd favourite, with the hummus dip and eggplant being particularly mouth-watering. Having had the perfect appetiser, our entrees only continued the momentum. I doubt I had ever gushed over vegetarian food before coming to this restaurant.Do note that prices are rather steep at this restaurant: be prepared to pay above $40 per person if you intend to have an appetiser and mains for each. I'd recommend you try this once - if only to challenge your conception of vegetarian food and how tastefully it can be done.",

Don't get me wrong, I am open to tofu burgers and all things vegetarian but I was in the mood for some meat that night. The surrounding restaurants were packed so I decided to stick it out and stay. Nothing in particular on the menu caught my eye so I just played it safe and went with a risotto. I think it was a mushroom based one. Risotto to me is like Italian porridge and if done right, it could pack quite a load of flavor. The one I had at Original Sin was a tad bit bland \u00a0or maybe it was my taste-buds that were being stubborn. Either way it just tasted like comfort food without the meat. Not much to rave about but great environment to enjoy an alfresco dinner!",
