    "text": "I didn't think much of this place when I had my salad with soup and sandwich shortly after it opened. I thought it was a wannabe following the success of Saladstop several years ago when there were just not many salad places. Fast forward to this week. I wanted some fresh veggies and this was the only option then. I am glad I gave it another try. The menu has been tweaked and there are more varieties in what's available. Plus I found the yummy toppings which i like - mushrooms and beets. Besides the regular salad with the cold deli or protein, you can also order hot protein for your salad. It may look confusing but it is quite easy to choose what you want. You can also add the soup and sandwich to your salad. As this is part of Cedele, you can be sure the soup will be good, likewise for the bread.",

For $12, you get a mixed of romaine lettuce and pasta/rice, choose 2 proteins and 4 greens and either an iced tea or orange juice.The pasta and rice selection are delicious, always a plus for someone who tries to eat healthy yet still want some carbs choices.The proteins are great. There are the heavily marinated mushrooms, the cheese, smoked salmon, sausages, chicken and tuna to choose from. The greens are not too shabby, I would say. However, I have quite a tough time to choose them because I personally don't eat quite a few greens, thus leaving me with options like edamame, braised brinjals, red beans, olives, nuts, eggs. \u00a0There are \u00a0also broccoli, corns, beetroots, sprouts, cherry tomatoes, etc. For $13, you can have a bowl of salad and a soup. It is a good deal, only in Singapore.",

The one thing that I've always felt was missing from Singapore was a good ol' salad bar and low and behold - one has now been presented to us!I actually come here on the way to work or whatever just to get a salad. Sometimes I'll drive down with the family to grab salads and then go home again if theres no food in the house (and we're all being a bunch of lazy people .. but really just for the fact that their salads taste a lot better than what we would make haha).Would definitely recommend toss & turn if you're in the orchard area. There are now quite a few 'salad bars' but this is definitely my favourite with taste, options, flavour and portion size. It's a winner!",

    "text": "Toss & Turn by Cedele should be a fairly new concept, so new that even their service staff had trouble articulating the various sets that we tried ordering!Dont get me wrong, the food is pretty good and the concept of sandwiches, soups and salads is great. Plus the fact that it's be Cedele, you can be sure that quality of the food is awesome as well and it's really great!However, the number of sets are somewhat too many, it confused not just the consumers but also the service staff. A mix of small/half sandwiches plus large/full size soup vs the other way round and not forgetting throwing salad into the whole combo, it's not easy to grasp that quickly.Because of that, the order process became a struggle. As everyone queued along the \"canteen\" line, the wait took a little long as most customers had to clarify the sets and details of the order with the service staff. Perhaps giving it a little more time, things will get more familiar.",

In exchange, they let us pick another protein, but could only have 1 topping (instead of 2 protein and 4 toppings). Well, not that I really minded, but seriously, shouldnt they have stocked up their ingredients in preparation for the weekend crowd? Mind boggling.Anyhow, serving portion here, especially for the salad, is VERY generous. I shared a full sized salad with my girlfriend before gym, and we were both decently filled. They have a half portion salad too, but for more than half the price. Not sure how the Math works. But hey, I'd recommend just taking away the remaining of your salad if you can't finish it. Makes another meal :)",

I was delighted to see them offer smoked salmon (generous rolls) and shrimp so i chose those but my other favorite beetroot was in the same category so i couldn't have that - bummer. Choices in general were not that many and the self serve salad dressings were not that exciting in variety too( i think it was just 5). in short, I'm just spoiled by what Salad Stop offers at almost the same price. Unless I'm craving for smoked salmon or shrimp, i don't believe I'll be at Toss & Turn much. I must however mention there is deal going on now and it's a full sandwich with either a small side of soup or salad for $12.90; the shrimp avocado with spicy sauce sandwich actually looks quite yummy.",
