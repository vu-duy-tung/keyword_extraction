I was shown to a chosen table which I later found that the chair had oily stains on.Quite a lot of choices on the menu. Prices were more on the high sides. Wonder Woman's Box Office Power Drink ($10.90++)An ice-blended beverage created with all-time favourite salted caramel popcorn flavourThe drink was quite sweet and lacking of the popcorn taste which one was expecting. Instead it tasted more like oreo cookie. Maybe it should have a change of description.Paradise Island Mac & Cheese \u00a0(S$18.90++)Conchiglie rigate baked in special 5 cheese \u00a0sauce and mentaiko sauce, flavoured with white button mushrooms , turkey \u00a0bacon and garlicMy first choice was pancake but I was informed it was not available more than 10 minutes after I had placed my order. The pasta was well cooked and flavourful, although one could not taste the 5 distinct taste of cheese nor the pollack roe which was commonly found in mentaiko sauce. The dish itself was a tab dry. Didn't really found any garlic, but there was shrimps in it. Needed another change of description here.",

There's a LOT of options to choose from and it's a cool place to look around if you're into the comics/movies, and they have a lot of neat replicas. I got a chocolate themed drink (don't remember the name) that was a chocolate OVERLOAD. It was chocolate ice cream with gobs of nuetella, chocolate syrup, toasted marshmallow and whipped cream topping. It sounds really good, but the chocolate they used tasted so artificial that it ruined the drink for me. I usually don't have high expectations for novelty drinks, but it was really hard to even drink the fake chocolate taste. The service was also very, very slow. There was no one in the cafe but we had to wait 20 mins at the cashier for someone to see to us. It seemed like the staff was avoiding us at one point. The concept of the store is cool, but I would suggest going for a simpler drink if you want to visit.",

Their coffee are smelling nice and taste good too. Their side snacks are quite a range too. We ordered their truffles fries and it was good. \u00a0And for their dessert we ordered their waffles. It was decorated beautifully. Makes us really happy. Beside their cafe, they have a retail shop selling the DC characters products ranging from clothing to accessories. Their service isn't good enough. Their staffs wasn't attention to us. We have to keep signalling to them. Didn't try out their main dishes yet but definitely still will visit again next time.",

OK, we really should've gone looking for a restaurant that was more Singaporean (is that a word?) but instead we landed here. The first thing we stopped at was the cute store, loaded with fun DC super heroes stuff. Then we decided we were hungry. There was a small wait and you had to pay for water (which was weird, since it was the first time we had to pay for water since we landed a week earlier). Still, loved the DC integrations into all the food and drink items. The alcoholic drink items tended to land on the sweet side which made it difficult to drink. Still, the drinks were pretty stiff anyway. Got my friend to drink two and he was VERY happy. I ordered the Green Lantern burger, complete with the symbol on the bun. It had chicken with chunks of shrimp and crab meat sauce all over it. UGHHH it was great. The portion was so large that I had to take most of it home. We also got complimentary chips & salsa since we had to wait long (although....with the drinks, we didn't think we waited long at all). Service was pretty great and there is tons of stuff to buy and fill your Super Hero needs.Clearly, there are cheaper places to eat but this place is a fun one. And you can take a picture with Wonder Woman.",

They have a pretty interesting menu and lots of items are cutely decorated to keep up with the superhero theme! The taste of the food was pretty good, but the cost was on the steeper end probably due to the decor put into it. I really enjoyed the flash drink, which is basically a strawberry milkshake. Service here is very slow and kind of weird. We were warmly welcomed but ordering, waiting for the food, and getting the check were definitely a process. If you come here, do not expect quick or efficient service. Other than that, worth checking out for the theme and experience!",

When I stopped to take a photo before I was seated, my Friend noticed that the waitress let out a sigh of impatience. It's 615 on a weekday and the place only had a few tables taken - there were plenty of empty seats. Sat down ordered 2 drinks off the menu and a glass of ice water. For food, two cakes and one portion of truffle fries. After 5 mins, was told that two cakes are not available. Friend asked to see the menu and waiter said ok, but never came back.Two strawberry coolers came when we just ordered one. Fries came. At least the fries were good, hence the single star for this place. After a while, we reminded the waitress of our order of a drink and water which has not come. The waitress looked at me as if I was stupid and said - we don't serve ice water here.Seriously now... So I just ordered mineral water with ice.... But after 5 mins or so, a glass of ice water came. Friend was a bit frighten to drink the unidentified looking water.... Have not paid yet. Typing this here and hopefully the paying experience itself won't require me to update this already nasty review even more....",
