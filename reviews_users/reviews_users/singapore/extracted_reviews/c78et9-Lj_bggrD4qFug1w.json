    "text": "Orange Thimble faces stiff competition from their next door neighbour, Tiong Bahru Bakery. They are a bit different in that it's more a small cafe with savouries, sweets, ice cream, and coffee.I've only ordered their cappuccino for takeaway, and my basic coffee tastes have rendered it good. My colleagues say the food is horrible but they're a fussy bunch so I'm not sure you should believe them 100%.*On the plus side, they have a really cool space that's perfect for hanging out, catching up, or getting some work done. I've never been able to explore the rooms further in but looking through the windows from the cashier, it looks cute.If the \"too cool for school\" crowd next door is bothering you, Orange Thimble is a great alternative. If you chill in the outdoor space, you might get a visit from Bob, the local celebrity kitty! *Did I say that out loud?",

Entering the shop, you see a welcoming display of bakes, enticing you to pick them. Wasn't up for coffee so I eventually settled for a hot chocolate and a slice of brioche (from the entire loaf I bought).The hot chocolate was well-creamed with a fluffy foam to it and pair really nicely with marshmellows. Quite possibly the best hot chocolate I have had in SG. The lads behind the counter very nicely toasted the brioche for me to a perfect warmth. The bake was just that slight bit crispy while keeping a soft, fluffy bite within. I didn't have stomach space but was really tempted by more of the bakes. Will definitely make a next visit.",

Of all the caf\u00e9s in Tiong Bahru, I'd say that they lose out based on both quality and on decour. It's truly a shame; I wished this experience wasn't so disappointing!",

However, I'm not necessarily bowled over by the food or the drinks. The coffee is alright, and the cakes are good but not good enough for me to want to return and have them a second time. All in all, this feels a bit like a case of style over substance. Getting as trendy as it is, Tiong Bahru is certain to have quite a few of these (and it certainly does...) and I'm not one of those who can be won over by something that's average but happens to be well-packaged.",

Firstly it is adequately big enough for humans to be inside and not feel cramped up. However I read about how it is getting very crowded now so I would avoid it on weekends if I don't feel like dealing with everyone trying to 'relax' at a stressful environment.I also really liked the decor of the place. It is all vintage knick knacks and carefully sourced plates and cups. The food itself is nothing amazing to shout about, though I think they have handmade ice cream from somewhere else, and the cake I had tasted good too.It is the perfect place to just have a cuppa and read, or have a nice catch up with a friend.",

Granted, there are more of the arty farty types hanging around now, but I figure they're too concerned with their own cool vibes than to notice my messy bed hair. Go to orders are always, always the English Breakfast and two cups of flat white coffees. I always find English Breakfasts in SG to be severely overpriced - why do restauranteurs insist on charging upwards of $10 for toast, bacon, sausage, tomatoes, baked beans and mushrooms? Alas, being too lazy to DIY has its downsides. How it works is that you order and pay, and are handed a buzzer that flashes and vibrates violently when your order is ready. The coffee is always aromatic and smooth, and served with an old school Iced Gem biscuit. On the other hand, the breakfast's standard tends to vary from day to day. Sometimes I get two sausages, sometimes no mushrooms, sometimes this, sometimes that. They usually make up for it in some way though. This place gets very crowded and the wait staff are usually not able to handle the crowds. People mill around, waiting for their buzzer to buzz, and then collect their chow at the cashier, which makes it quite a bit of a squeeze. I used to go to OT out of sheer laziness, but don't go there anymore.",

Try to come on a weekday when things aren't as hectic, and you'll find yourself able to spend hours here, just lounging on a couch and flipping through last month's edition of Vogue. As previously mentioned, the coffee is decent - though if you want stellar coffee, then you're better off at neighbouring 40 hands. The Orange Thimble does serve pretty good ice cream though - try their sesame ice cream. It's served to you in a quaint white-blue china bowl - very reminiscent of your childhood. It's a perfect place for weekday brunch, and is a favourite among my group of friends",
