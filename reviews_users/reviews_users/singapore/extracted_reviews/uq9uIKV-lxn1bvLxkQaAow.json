    "text": "Eaten here about 4 times... And that in itself should mean something with all the food options in Tiong Bahru! Two times I came here, it was all out seafood - crabs, oysters, prawns. All fresh and all well done. Not as expensive as some other places around the area but it is not cheap. However, the quality is there. I like their salted egg yolk crab better than their chili crab (though they are apparently famous for their Chili crabs. The other times I went, it was for simple dishes, late dinner - fried noodles, tofu, vege dishes. All well nicely done. Again, not the cheapest but the quality is there. One recent meal there, had the \"moon\" fried Hor fun (very good), Japanese tofu (nice), fried Pak choi with mushrooms (nice but abit too spicy for me). I had a warm barley (decent at $2) and my Friend had their Aloe vera with lemon, came in a short glass with crushed ice and a slice of lemon. Nice :) when the bill came, realise it was $6 \u00a0still, good way to cool down :) Another good thing about this place is that it has a lot of seating (though if you are doing dinner on the weekend, no harm booking ahead) and it opens till late.... Or early, however you want to describe the wee hours of the morning :)",

Pretty much a landmark, you see their bright lights and logo lit in neon in your rear view mirror as you drive past along Tiong Bahru Road.Long before the mustachioed, flannel and skinny jean wearing hipsters invaded Tiong Bahru, in the days of yore when bird cages were hung nearby, Sin Hoi Sai stood close to the intersection of Seng Poh Road and Tiong Bahru Road, beckoning to many a hungry customer disembarking at the bus stop in front. Over the years, I've seen it go from a shop occupying one unit to expansion to the adjacent building and getting an AC interior and signage lit in neon.It's always crowded for dinner. The menu is extensive, and the food is generally consistent and extra points for them being open real late (I mean as late as 5am!). They do the dishes generally well but I never ever found that particular standout or Signature dish. One thing close to that is the \"Moonlight hor fun\" (\u6708\u5149\u6cb3), fried rice noodles with a raw egg cracked in the middle.It's allllllrrrrrright. Prices have increased over the years and you normally get dinged for the peanuts and the 3Ts (tea, towel and tax). But when it's late and you're hungry, this is the spot.",

The place is really clean, polite staff, and not too crowded that you have to wait. The only downside, is it's not located within my neighborhood, oh well.We tried a lot of things but the standouts include:Moonlight hor fun - it's a fried rice noodles with raw egg on top of it which then you have to mix it well on your own on the dining table. Prawn paste chicken - it's the better version that I've tried so far; very fragrant, crispy on the outside yet tender and moist on the inside. They are like local version of korean fried chicken that I love as well. Really love this dish that I often joke to my friends I would come here alone and just eat the prawn paste chicken by myself.Also, IMHO, I think this is by far the best local Chinese food I have ever had in Singapore. I crave Sin Hoi Sai more often that I would like to admit. Believe it or not, this is the oldest and most popular restaurant in the Tiong Bahru area, that even many local celebrities visit often!!!!!!They have delectable extensive menu and I must say that most of them taste very good. It's a busy restaurant and perfect for family dinner. Service is quite slow during peak hour (but tolerable) as they're kind short of staff but it wouldn't hinder your food experience here. Will be back for sure, as I want to try more dishes!",

Service is good, even though some staff don't speak English well. The place has a nice and relaxed vibe. Prices are comparable to other seafood joints. If weather permits, sit outside.

My friends usually opt to sit outside in the open air where its naturally cooling, rather than in the aircon.I recommend the San Lou hor fun, which is tasty and has lots of mushrooms, fish and beansprouts (which I personally dislike, but the rest of the dish is tasty). The Yue Guang hor fun (brown and comes with a raw egg in the middle which you mix in) gets a bit too much after a few bites.Also, their hei zhor and prawn paste chicken are not bad, and the Si Ji Dou (beans of some sort) is apparently quite good too. The seafood tofu though, not so good. Ours turned out rather sour, though it turned out after checking that the chef had added vinegar for reasons unknown, but the manager apologised profusely, took it off our bill and even gave us some jelly to make up for it.

I don't think they use fresh prawns as well as the prawns in the hor fun always taste mashy and the noodles are lacking the wok hei to give it that extra kick.

This time, I just walked across for a quiet evening meal and ordered asparagus with dried shrimp (about 28 SGD) which unfortunately was out. Not cheap this place! I finally settled for a classic: sliced fish with ginger and scallions (18SGD): about the most expensive I have eaten in SG but impeccable. Althought this is a busy road, it is somehow nice to sit outside on the pavement. Service is OK, though English not always well understood. I didn't have wine because it goes by the bottle, but I spotted a good Alsace Pinot Noir on the menu.",
