    "text": "This is one of the best Italian restaurant in Singapore, in my opinion. The quality of the cooking is in the league of Valentino's although they do not have as much traditional cooked items (and I am not complaining as long as what is on the menu is done well). In terms of ambience, I am glad they have shifted to Greenwood Avenue from Jln Pemimpin. The restaurant offers modern, chic, casual dining and is much larger with both indoor and outdoor seating vs its previous location. Its staff strength has also swelled to cater to the larger seating capacity. \u00a0Marcus and his team always makes me feel welcome whenever I drop by. If you drive (and parking is a bitch here), there's a valet service. I love the squid ink pasta and squid ink risotto which you don't need to pre-order, unlike Valentino's. You can taste the freshness and tenderness of the seafood, plus the pasta and risotto are done al dente (and I am pretty fussy that this basic stuff ought to be done right) as it should. \u00a0They are prepared using authentic squid ink sauce and not squid ink pasta. \u00a0The pizza is good too (thin crust) with just the right amount of balance between cheese and ingredients and their seafood is one of the freshest you can get. I was told the seafood is hand-picked at the fish market every morning. \u00a0I have no complaints about the steak, nicely grilled on the outside and juicy and tender (not chewy) on the inside, cooked as well as can be expected. In summary, the quality and consistency of the food here is amazing considering the copious amount of food being prepared for its ravenous crowd.And the chocolate verdant dessert is to die for, crispy on the outside and soft molten chocolate lava flowing from the inside. \u00a0We tend to over-eat and often end up with no room for dessert. When we are here, we make sure we exercise restrain so that we don't miss out on the dessert. The wine menu has also been much improved and now comes with a much larger variety of Italian wine. \u00a0It's a great place to dine with a large group of friends or with the family. And having said that, I should organize a group dinner here soon. I am glad to see that it is crowded and the restaurant is doing well so that more people in Singapore will continue to enjoy quality Italian fare.Bon appetit!!",

    "text": "Lunch set at $19.90++Be warned, the set lunch portions are SMALL! It started with a cioppino (3 stars). The seafood didn't taste very fresh and the soup/stew itself was unremarkable. The main, a spaghetti aglio olio (3 stars) with tiger prawns, was cooked al dente. Major plus points. But again the prawns didn't taste fresh and had the sort of crunchy flavorless texture that makes me dislike prawns. Lastly, you get coffee/tea OR tiramisu. We had the tiramisu (3 stars). The small slice didn't wow - I thought my aunt's tiramisu tasted better.The pizza we had came with artichokes, black olives, Parma ham (4 stars). This was far better! Thin crust, but not very generous with the ingredients.Don't think I'll be in a hurry to come back.",

The staff are great, such a refreshing change to have competent and knowledgeable staff. This is important as they steer you in the right direction.The food is amazing, there probably isn't a bad dish.. Probably.. All that I have had are amazing.The starters are great. And the mains are so very generous and tasty. The Italian theme doesn't overpower the food, and they cater for all tastes.Having been with children too.. I can assure they cater for them too.Great for couples, groups and families. Have the Seafood in a Bag.. Just perfect.",

I think the only okay was the coffee. Oysters had sand, the rest of the food was difficult to finish... service was poor. They don't bother waiting for you to finish your food before bringing out the next course... (and why the rush? There were, what, 3 occupied tables?)Horrid experience, although the ambiance was nice, being quiet and well done up. Bright side was that the food was so bad we could focus on conversation.",
