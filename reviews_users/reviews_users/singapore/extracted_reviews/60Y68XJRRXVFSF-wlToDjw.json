The lack of a 5 Star review was due to the seating situation (which probably can't be changed much now) being very uncomfortable; wooden benches too small for the American butt. The wings had a great flavor and everything was reasonably priced. I felt like I was back in Dublin.",

The noise level can get high at times.The service is normal and friendly.The drink menu is quite large for those finicky drinkers.Tried the tenderloin steak cubes as an appetizer.The steak was tender and juicy. But the kicker for awesome plate was the blue cheese sauce for the cubes.I ordered a misc salad plate with roast beef, cheese and greens, with a serving of fresh soft bread. Again a great mix good ingredients, and fresh veggies.For the main course I ordered the Connemara chicken. This came with fresh mash potatoes and cucumber and green beans.The drinks are a bit pricey is the only downside.Overall the meal was comfortable and very satisfying!! I look to coming here again for the tenderloin cubes.",

NO separation AT ALL. \u00a0They obviously do not know how to pour the PROPER Black and Tan.Overall, I rate it as FUN (because of the EXCELLENT live music) and GOOD. \u00a0This is a SWING BY if NEARBY.",

The mini-order was more than I could finish and tasted great. I would repeat for the fish and chips anyday. Another positive...staff talked me into another pint about 10 minutes before happy hour ended which was a nice gesture as they told me I'd save $2 off the pint. Nice atmosphere, great Irish pub in Singapore!",

Just be careful when starting a tab as they may overcalculate your drinks once Happy Hours ends. Had a group buy us 2 rounds of drinks after HHs ended, and were charged for drinks we didn't buy.. Easier to pay at each round than argue with the waitresses at then end of the night!Food and drinks are a reasonable priced for Singapore - though HHs on draught drinks are only about $2SGD cheaper than during non-HHs..Staff are nice and friendly and super helpful.

Consistently a great place to hang out for a late Sunday lunch, a welcoming bar staff and comfortable chairs and tables to relax. Firstly, the beers are not at extortionate prices - Guinness and Kilkenny @ $12/ pint, Archipelago Red Ale @ $11.50. These prices include GST - something I wished bars and restaurants were forced to include in their menu prices.My friend ordered the 2 course Sunday roast ($20) which included roast beef, mashed potatoes, some other vegetables, Yorkshire pudding and gravy. I had a slice of the beef, and it was fantastic. I ordered the fish and chips ($16) and as others have said here - it is fantastic, the fish is fresh and the chips taste like they are homemade.Overall, if you want to while away a lazy Sunday afternoon, stop here for a bit and recharge your batteries. The prices are very reasonable, the food is excellent and it is just a nice place to hang out.",

Service was a little slow, but competent. The beer was cold and about what expected. The burger was ok - had a bit of gristle - the French fries were good and an adequate amount.
