    "text": "The location is nice on the corner with outside seating. The menu is okay with options from light starters to nice meals. We ordered the happy hour mini wagyu beef sliders to start off with. Then shared the seared skirt steak sandwich to split. Both filling but wouldn't write home about them. They have a happy hour from 5-8 pm for half off house pours. The happy hour deal is good I'd say the rest is a bit average. Nice to grab a drink and hang out on a afternoon but wouldn't come for quiet date. Can be loud as it's not enclosed. All open which is nice for hangouts. Ambience and area I'd say 4-5 stars for friends. Food 3 and service 3-4I'll come back for a happy hour drink !",

Menu was a single sheet.Express Lunch Set ($25++)Soup of the day, sandwich of the day, choice of soft drinkThe soup was broccoli soup, served with croutons and shredded cheese. It was rich and creamy with bites of broccoli in it.The sandwich was truffle egg sandwich with watercress. The bread was light and crusty. It smelt very truffle when served.I selected ginger ale for the soft drink which was light and refreshing.There was also free wifi available in the cafe.",

    "text": "Prive is a nice little spot open late on Orchard Road. If you're prepared to spend a tiny fortune on mediocre food but good ambience, Prive is the place for you. This hip little joint boasts adorable little chairs and tables and an eclectic menu which combines Singaporean and Western cuisines. I ordered the laksa which was $17 and contained soggy noodles and a tasteless but thick broth. My sister had the aglio olio which just tasted weird but was cooked to al dente perfection.Overall I would never come back unless I desperately needed a late night drink with a fancy friend. Which let's face it is pretty often.....",

The pricings do not justify the quality of the food and service rendered. The wait staff, especially the Koreans seemed very disinterested in their job.Overall, you can come here for drinks,desserts and people watch. Other than that, don't expect much from Prive Wheelock.",

For example, the ultimate breakfast has 2 eggs, sausage, rosti & maple bacon. While somewhat tasty, the portion of bacon consisted of a single piece that fits within a tablespoon, same with the rosti. Just not worth the price. One Man Coffee on Upper Thomson has a much better brunch breakfast & their candied bacon is much tastier.",
