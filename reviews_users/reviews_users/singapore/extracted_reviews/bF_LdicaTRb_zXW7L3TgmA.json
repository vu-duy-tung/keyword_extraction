    "text": "I really enjoy the maki rolls from this place because there are quirky references to \"the sushi roll\" everywhere plus the ingredients are fresh and healthy (depending on what you select to go in it, of course). I mean how many places will offer to stuff your maki with items like dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, crunchy jellyfish, honey soy chicken and Yuzu Honey Vinaigrette? Hey, I think I just created a roll, albeit not one I would suggest though. See how simple that was to order a customized roll? Can't decide or in a hurry? Just pick one of their House Sushi's that they've already created for the indecisive customers. I just wished they didn't have to put each roll into those fancy boxes, especially if you're going to eat-in.Seems like such a waste. For those with nut allergies ... Beware: \"Our food is prepared at a facility that uses NUT ingredients.\" So roll yourself outta bed and go get some!",

It costs $8.90 a roll and only available at the Cathay outlet, via mobile application and online ordering.The sushi roll is stuffed with roasted peppers, kani stick, shredded chicken, roasted pumpkin, deep fried soft shell crab and tomato based chilli sauce. The soft shell crab gives a crispy and crunchy texture, while the pumpkin gives it a sweet and buttery texture. Although the chilli sauce looks a bit dark, it actually tastes not bad giving it a sweet taste with a hint of spicy. Together it gives a explosive combination in the mouth.So don't forget to try it. It is only available from now till end of this month.",

Customizable sushi in beautiful packaging reminiscent of Bankaku-style boxes - what isn't there to love?Located at the foot of The Cathay, I would sneakily suggest you buy a roll and bring it to the cinema if you have the munchies. I especially love brown rice in my sushi, and this is the place to get it. I won't go into detail about what works when it comes to maki rolls, because everybody has differing tastes, and what works for me may suck for you.What I want to talk about is the speed of rolling makis. The team is inconsistent with their efficiency. Some days I get my maki super quick, some days I get it super slow. I always go about 6pm and they have the same number of staff each time I go, so I assume this is a business processes issue. Maybe they'll improve on the speed in future - this is fast food after all.P.S. They don't take credit cards. Cash is king here!",

    "text": "i'm lovin' itYes, I realize this is the slogan of a certain fast food chain but it describes perfectly my thoughts about Maki-san. It came with high expectations (both Yelpers as non-Yelpers recommended this place) and was a bit afraid that it would be a let down but this concept is just plain awesomeness.Is it the best sushi I ever had? Nope* but they offers good quality sushi at a decent price and the concept is fantastic. As previous reviews described, this is Sushi meets Subway and coincidently I love sushi and I am a subway fan so this restaurant was right up my alley.I am a big fan of the possibility to customize your dishes (yes I am THAT person who takes longer to order a starbucks drink than to drink it) and I am always having a hard time picking sushi as I always end up thinking: \"this roll has xyz that I love but I wish it came with abc which comes in this other roll...\". Maki-san solves that problem by letting you design your own roll. For eternal doubters as myself it is still a chore as it creates even more choices but it gives you a strange sense of empowerment.I went for the combo which included a mega-san, a canned drink and a snack which came in under 13 S$. My roll was super tasty (maybe because it hit all the right spots since I could pick my own ingredients ) and the snack I chose was super delicious! I would have never expected that crab stick tempura would be something I would rave about but the dough was super light & fluffy and the cheese dip which I picked for it made it a match in haven.Although I have rated it the full five stars I do have some minor points of criticism:1) it is filled with teenagers which made me feel out but a) this is not maki-sans fault; b) it might be due to the time of the day and location (film theatre on a Saturday late afternoon) and c) I might just having to accept that I am getting older...2) I like to drink a lot with my food, in the meantime I have accepted that in Singapore there is seldom a bottomless soda but since there is quite a queue it is difficult to purchase an extra drink if you want a refill so a soda fountain /a water dispenser would be welcome, or even a way to purchase another drink without having to queue in the food queue.Overall this place is amazing. I was going to start a petition: \"I want Maki-San at Holland V\" but I figured it would lead me to go there more than once a week \u00a0and not eat anything else anymore so I am happy for now since the Cathay is not too far away either.* in case you are wondering what for me the best sushi is: without a doubt I would pick a place in Japan. No competition possible, sushi is just so much better there.",

    "text": "Came here on a sunday at 1130am just as they were pulling up the shutters. The biggest selling point about maki san is that you get to make your own maki.. something like subway, except with sushi-ingredients.I went with the little-san $7.90, you get to pick 1 wrap (seaweed or healthy soy +$1)1 rice \u00a0(japanese white rice or healthy brown rice)3 essentials (avocado, steamed ebi, ebiko aka prawn roe)1 sprinkle (tempura crunch)1 house sauce (japanese caesar)And you get to watch them make them in front of you, which I think the staff was abit nervous and though he placed 5 prawns in the maki, admist his fluster whilst rolling up the maki, one shrimp fell out! *the horror*I enjoyed the maki. The tempura crunch was a good choice and it was very crispy instead. The prawn roe was rather fresh and the prawns were fresh and crunchy. The brown rice was also a nice healthy touch to the maki so I rarely see japanese maki with brown rice.All in all, a good choice for a quick lunch but a little-san to me, is still too big for me to finish on my own. The Mega-san is definitely big enough to share amongst two.",

    "text": "Craving for good yet excellent sushi in town area? Look no further as this place serves both flavorful and budget friendly sushi.Located at the basement of the Cathay is this store (near to the escalator too). I've also seen a few people posting pictures of the sushis and the packaging box for the sushi. Decided to takeaway the Child's Play (House Sushi).As it was past lunch time, there were not a lot of people queueing. And as this is my first time stepping into a \"customized sushi\" store, I had no clue besides looking up at the head boards which specified the house special sushis, little or mega san sushis (different ingredients). After skimming through the menu of the house sushi, I decided to get the Child's Play as it sounds tasty.After ordering, you will receive a round-shaped thing with the order number on it while the \"sushi masters\" prepare the different sushis. While waiting, I realized that they have either seaweed wrap or healthy soy wrap and you could choose white rice or brown rice if you are to customized your sushis. There is a step-by-step form you can use to order the customized sushi which made it simpler for the \"sushi masters\". For the house sushi, they only come with a seaweed wrap and white rice with the ingredients listed according to its names.Consumed my sushi a couple of hours later. Even though the paper wrap inside the box was wet from the sushi itself, the sushi was still in perfect order (the box helped it not to spill the ingredients inside it). It was definitely flavorful and it has quite a number of ingredients which leave you with a tangy feeling of wanting more of it. It came in 6 pieces and the cut was a thick cut. The seaweed added flavor to the sushi itself. The packaging of the sushi was colorful and at the center of it, the logo of the store was clearly labelled too. For takeaway, they will provide a pair of wooden chopsticks, two packets of soy sauce and a packet of wasabi.Overall, it was definitely a good choice to try this place out. Will come back for more sushi soon :)",

You pick up an ingredients list for either a sushi roll or salad2. You check off the appropriate ingredients you want (e.g. brown/white rice, seaweed, \u00a0tempura shrimp/smoked duck/salmon sashimi, caramelized japanese sweet potatoes/asparagus/corn/carrots, wasabi mayo/caesar dressing, etc.)3. You give your order to the cashier and pay the appropriate amount4. Cashier gives you a buzzer to let you know when your order is ready5. Pick up your order when your beeper buzzesI almost always choose a brown rice option with soft shell crab tempura, avocado, sunflower seeds and a few more things. The ingredients are all fresh and healthy and the service is very friendly.If you order the sushi roll, there's this robotic contraption that cuts the sushi-- which looks really nifty.It's decorated in colorful furniture that's clearly painted Ikea furniture and works really well with the simple, artsy style of the place.Relaxing atmosphere and good for grabbing a quick bite with friends.Not the cheapest of places, but sushi never is.Thumbs up",

The miso dressing paired with corn, the lemon included in the egg wrap and cream cheese and salmon roll allow me to safely say that Maki-San is a Japanese fusion restaurant/cafe. The brightly colored walls, cartoon artwork, sensitive music, and sushi rolls wrapped like a present leads me \u00a0to my final conclusion, that this restaurant is designed for young girls. I spent 30 minutes in the cafe and all the customers were female, half were wearing school uniforms. The artwork depicting angry ingredients with the slogan, \"if you don't like it, take it out!\" Illustrates just how customizable the menu is for picky eaters or those with diet restrictions.",
