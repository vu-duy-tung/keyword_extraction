    "text": "Purely based on quality of food and drinks, 3.5 at most, but additional 0.5 stars for the free wifi. This cafe is quietly tucked away on the second and third levels of one of the shophouses in holland village. I came here on a weekday afternoon and easily got a seat. I love how this cafe offers free wifi. It's getting harder to find caf\u00e9s with free wifi in Singapore to prevent customers from staying excessively long but I that similarly deters me from visiting them! My order was taken by a pleasant and good-natured barista who recommended the tea time set. This is basically a drink (lattes etc) and a slice of one of the featured cakes for a price of $6.50. My mocha alone would have cost $5.80. This cafe serves up a decent cup of mocha. It was aromatic and flavorful, and the chocolate was not overwhelming. The Oreo cheesecake on the other hand was a disappointment. While the tea set does come across as a good deal, I would pass on the dessert the next time round.",

    "text": "Spotted this cafe while walking around holland village area in search of food for dinner. From the outside it looks like a plain building. Need to climb a flight of stairs to get to the counter where you will be ordering your foods and drinks. Seating area there is one on second floor and one on the third floor. There is a lift that brings you up and down in case you do not want your serving trays to spill over while climbing on the steps.Seating area is rather small for a cafe but have to admit that the second floor interior design was good. It has the outdoors components inside. Third floor is just more like office hang out interior design. There are a number of staffs working but you need to self serve but they will clear your plate away. Food wise, I had a portebello pasta (mushroom pasta) in cream sauce. Price wise it's a bit on the higher end. I'm a little disappointed with the pasta as the sauce is dry and there is not much taste to it. My friend who had bacon carbonara commented the same.I am not sure how the coffee tasted here as I cannot drink coffee. There are a few selection of TWG teas in packets and Arizona teas in the bottle. Overall it is a nice concept for a cafe and it is good environment to hang out with friends. Next time round I will order their bake goods instead.",

    "text": "Espresso - a small volume of potent coffee, partially covered with a medium brown crema. There were some citrus notes, but they were secondary to the intense bitterness which followed in the aftertaste, and which lingered long after the shot had been finished. The bitterness is dominant in this shot, with some harsh elements present also. This may not be an issue for pour over coffees, or americanos, where the end product is diluted with hot water, however an espresso shot is more concentrated, which can exacerbate harsh notes. There are a number of different types of coffee beans available however, and D'Good offers customers the option of choosing their own preferred type. It may be advisable to highlight this more prominently at the ordering counter though - it is certainly a selling point that not all cafe's in the area offer. Cappuccino - there are some large bubbles present in the foam, but not in sufficient quantities to affect the texture. The latte art is nicely executed also. The mouthfeel is dominated by the texture and taste of warm milk, rather than the hybrid of milk and microfoam that can work in conjunction to form a smooth hybrid of taste and texture. The flavour of the underlying espresso shot is somewhat diluted by the milk, but the bitter aftertaste is still discernible. This may be entirely subjective, but the intense citrusy bitterness described above may work better with pour over coffee, rather than with milk based drinks. However, as there are a number of bean varieties available, and the ability to customise drinks, this can quite easily be fixed, and may not even be an issue from week to week.Staff are friendly and accomodating to requests, noticing when customers are looking for sugar or water, and stepping in to help. Also, thought and effort has clearly gone into the decor and layout, with an intelligent use of space allowing for lots of seating space, as well as a very pleasant al fresco area on the upper level. Busy periods can cause delays however (just as they would in any cafe), with a delay in used cups and plates being cleared, and tables being cleaned. Staff seem clustered in the kitchen and ordering counter area instead, but it should be noted that they did collect plates from the upper level before the end of my visit. Increasing the frequency of staff checks on the upper level may help.The ordering counter can become crowded, and as a result customers collect drinks after they have been prepared. This may be to keep the ordering counter clear, but one minor issue is that drinks can be slightly less warm when the are collected. This is a minor issue though, keeping the ordering counter and roasting space clear is a good reason for doing so. At $14.50 for a single espresso and 2 cappuccinos, the prices are about right. There is also a selection of cakes and baked items available, as well as syphon and pour over coffee.Overall, this is not a bad cafe by any means, with some admirable traits - a good selection of beans and brewing methods, and a micro roastery - everything I look for in a quality cafe, and I genuinely want D'Good to succeed. With some minor changes to the beans used for different drinks, and to the frequency of checks on the upper levels, this could be a very good cafe in a great location.",

    "text": "Cute cosy cafe with yummy drinks. Affordable too!Came across this as we were randomly walking around Holland V. It's been awhile since I visited this area. Many cafes and restaurants come and go, and we were excited to try something new.D' Good Cafe caught our attention when we realize we could enter by the \"back door\". Climbed up the stairs and it felt like we entered another world all together. The lighting done right, adorable decor all around. Suits the hipsters and young students.We were told to pick up the menu and find a seat. It's a self service place where you place your order, make your payment and will be issued a pager to pick up your food when it's ready. We ordered a tea time meal which comes with an orange juice (there are other options) and a waffle. Initially I was expecting a full waffle unfortunate it turned it to be half a waffle. Urgh. Who got the other half! Anyway, i ordered a green tea matcha frappe thingy. It was absolutely delicious. It's been awhile since I drank a decent cup of green tea frappe. The price is fairly affordable and hence the throngs of students. The upper floor was really pretty however was super turned off when I saw the whole area filled with students on their laptop and notes. Almost felt like a classroom or tuition centre. We were on the 2nd floor which didn't have any students mugging but still had dating students cuddling on swings and cozy seats. Overall, a nice stopover for an affordable and delicious tea break. Strong air conditioning is definitely a plus too.",

Instagram your food pics with ample light on the 3fl (Alfresco seating available in addition to inside) Third floor tends to get the high decibels, bordering on canteen levels, while the second is more hushed. Brunch maybe, but keep expectations low and order the same as your partner. As I type this, my bangers and mash has been consumed, and my better half's lemon grass chicken is 37 min after ordering and still not here!\u00a0In the end, it took 40min to be plated. The kitchen is tiny. Stick with the easy to prepare dishes. Stick with the coffee which is decent. They are passionate about their beans. Mains are meh. Lastly, the price points are on the higher side. In sum, I wouldn't go out of my way. 2.5 Just average.",

The matcha frap is a really great drink but is slightly more pricer than the one found at starbucks!To improve on: they really need a better queue system, new customers are not aware that you need to queue and the staff have to chase the new customers away from reserved tables, AWKWARD!",

    "text": "D'Good Cafe is a whimsical spot to swing your worries away, right smack in the heart of Holland Village. It sits in a funky shop house unit that has 2 entrances and the layout reminded me of that children story about a house in a boot with many children (uh huh i really don't have much of a childhood).D'Good Cafe specializes in single-origin coffee beans, which are roasted in-house. The owner is some crazy coffee fanatic and you can get your Ethiopian, Guatemalan, Jamaican beans done the siphon, drip, pour-over or espresso way. You wouldn't be able to miss the Elektra espresso machine at the counter! If you're up for something more exotic, there's the famous Kopi Luwak (civet coffee) from the Wahana Estate in Sumatra for $38 a pop. You can also make your own blend here at D'Good Cafe too.Here's what we had. The Prawn Aglio Olio ($16) was a little on the dry side, especially after it cooled a little (it became clumpy). I thought it could use a little more salt but it's certainly quite well flavored. The prawns were nicely done and crunchy.I liked the Bacon Carbonara ($15) more than the previous pasta. It's creamy (more on the milky side) and certainly more satisfying (only if you like cream). Generous portions of bacon too. It would be perfect with some fried bacon bit and an egg.The Eggs Benedict ($13.50) was a sad sad portion. I was terribly disappointed by it in fact. The brioche was nice but was too thinly sliced. As a result, it was soaked through by the eggs. Too much vinegar was used in poaching the eggs and that contributed to the papery texture of the whites and that acidic taste. Holladaise sauce was weak too. Certainly not something i'd recommend ordering. Add on $3 to the breakfast sets for a Latte that is well balanced with a nice crema. I must say we were all happy with our choice of caffeine. The Earl Grey Lavender Latte ($7) was aromatic without being overpowering. I'm fearful of lavender because it just smells and tastes a little like air freshener but this was just right. The Caramel Hot Chocolate ($7.50) will satisfy your sweet tooth because it's on the sweet side but i found the chocolate a tad artificial. The foam had somewhat of a brulee texture which was interesting. And if you like latte art, they do a lot of cute animal prints.We concluded that the best part of the meal was the maple sea salt cheesecake ($9). You cannot miss this smokey sweet and creamy cheesecake. The cheese was rich but not too heavy and it went perfectly with the crunchy and compact graham crust. I suspect a lot of butter went into it but it's awesome. Repeat after me: Butter is awesome (especially salted ones).D'Good Cafe also has a rooftop area for alfresco dining. This would be perfect at night or on an extremely cool day. Pretty isn't it?I'd certainly be back for more cheesecake. Tried the Strawberry Cheesecake and it just didn't cut it after the mindblowingly good maple sea salt one. Enjoy this one!",

The cutest part is a swing where you can enjoy your coffee/food while looking out on the street. The coffee is typical \"cafe coffee\" but the food is pretty good. Even though it doesn't leave the deepest impression, I find myself frequenting it often because it's reliable, cozy, and right next to the Holland V mrt.It's often busy so make sure you check to see if there are seats that you like before ordering your coffee/food.",

    "text": "I'm one of those weird folks who doesn't drink coffee at all, yet love visiting cafes and bistros, especially the indie ones that are popping up around town faster than I can ever keep up.I've read about D'Good Cafe and have been curious and eager to try it out, glad to finally get the chance to do so on a Saturday afternoon after running some errands at Holland Village. Located on the the 2nd and 3rd floors amidst a bustling stretch of banks and F&B establishments, one would most certainly miss this if you weren't specifically looking for it. Look for The Body Shop, and then make your way up that narrow stairway next to it.Once you enter, it's a whole different world up there! The ordering counter is on Level 2, so place your orders here, then look for a table either on the other side of Level 2 (grab the lovely swing seats with a view if you're lucky enough); or head up to Level 3 attic for more seats, incl. a tiny outdoor patio (seats under a tent) if it's not too warm. And who would have guessed that they even have a little lift (yes elevator!) right inside the unit? You got to try it just for the fun of it, it's operated via a \"press and hold\" button inside the lift, maximum capacity of 4 :)We were here only for drinks - Mocha was good, Long Black was strong (a tad sour), reasonably priced between S$5 - 6 each. Don't make the same mistake I did though, I didn't check the price and ordered a simple \"Brewed Tea\" (since I don't take coffee), which turned out to be a TWG teabag in a small pot of hot water, no milk or cream provided... and that came up to S$7!! How on earth did my plain teabag cost more than the coffee, I just couldn't figure it out. But ouch!Service was bleh, the guy who took our order was sulky and not the least welcoming, fortunately the thoughtful cute decorations and detailed aesthetics sprinkled all around made up for that lack of service. All in all, a cute little hidden treasure, just save yourself some bucks, don't order the brewed tea.",
