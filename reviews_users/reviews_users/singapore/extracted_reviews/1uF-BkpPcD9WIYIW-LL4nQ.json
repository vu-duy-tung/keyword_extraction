I hadn't eaten at this location for more than a year because of my last experience, but thought I give them another shot. Bad decision. Last time it was service and food, this time service was okay, but food mediocre at best. Although, the service staff seemed to have a problem with English. That's a shocker in Singapore. Biggest compliant is they no longer serve bread with meals. Although, the still have a bread plate. I've never seen a soup and pasta restaurant that didn't have bread on the menu. Soup is still good, but the pasta was dry and way too much garlic. Sorry, CPK, it's Jamie's Kitchen next time.",

I opted for the Milan thin crust pizza. it was just a thin and with that crisp edge that I love. the toppings had a good serving of cheese and sausage, yet somehow I feel like something was missing. \u00a0it was kinda bland. not much flavor. maybe the caramelized onions were not mixed in well. not sure...it just wasn't the same. or maybe the US ingredients are just different. either way, the pizza was decent...the drink was great - cold and refreshing..just what a cooler should be. just think it's slightly over priced...8 bucks for that glass.. I wouldn't say I've scratched CPK off my list....its just not gonna be on my top must go to places. it will be a \"if I'm in the area and craving pasta...\" place. also..did CPK stop giving bread as a starter? or is that just a USA thing?",

This is until I head down to CPK for their popular wood-fired peking duck pizza. If you haven't tried wood-fired pizza before, I assure you this will be one of the best pizzas you've ever tasted. \u00a0The crust is slightly thin and crispy and filled with a hint of smoky aroma of the wood-fired oven. Topped with with duck slices, garnishes and crispy crackers, the peking duck pizza is one of the must-try dishes at CPK. The ambience of the restaurant is pretty modern and cosy at the same time --Probably due to use of amber lighting. The staff's service, especially the branch manager's, is extremely good. The branch manager was very helpful and courteous in acceding to my questions and request for an extra serving of deliciously fresh guacamole dips. What I have learnt from my visit: You have not tried real pizza if you've not try wood-fired pizza! (holds true at least for the ones at CPK)Must tries: Peking duck pizza, tortilla spring rolls",
