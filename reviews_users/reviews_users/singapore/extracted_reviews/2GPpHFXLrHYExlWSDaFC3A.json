The rice is fragrant and retains a lot of flavor from the chicken broth that is steamed in and the chicken is tender and bursting with flavor. This place is cheap and a very nice addition to Killiney road and i will be sad to leave it when I relocate.",

    "text": "New kid on the block. Very nice addition to Killiney Road. Many choices here but this one is special because of the charming atmosphere, exceeded expectations and great service. Each time we come by we are pleasantly surprised trying something new. The chicken rice comes in 7 variations, but there are other choices and they are all good. For those who don't read chinese, menus are also in English. In the day it's somewhat dimly lit, but always just right. Being further down the street than Kopitiam and the other busy shops, the street is quieter.",

    "text": "Jew Kit is relatively new to Killiney Road and I added it to Yelp last night during our visit. We thought we'd grab something after watching a movie in the theatre because it was late and neither one of us wanted to cook. The service was prompt, but they did not understand a lot of the questions we were asking. For example, what is the difference between the large and small sweet and sour pork. The food was good, but it was definitely a paleo cheat. We probably won't head back because there is not a lot on the menu that works for our diet, but I do recommend the Jew Kit for others looking for decent Chinese in the Somerset area.",

The basic staple known as \"Chicken Rice\" in Singapore, (Hainanese Chicken, everywhere else) Jew Kit offered the best quality for your money. \u00a0The portions are ample, the soup broth is flavorful, and the Kai lan in oyster sauce with fried garlic garnish were all simply fantastic!This place would have received 5 stars if it weren't for one event near closing time we were served subpar chicken. \u00a0It was caked and coated with a clear gelatin. \u00a0Perhaps they refrigerated the day's left over roasts and served it with the chicken stock morphing into a gelatinous goo from being chilled?All in all, it was our \"go to\" stall for Chicken Rice when we lived near Killiney Road.",

    "text": "This is a really cute and cheap place to grab some Chinese food on Killiney road. I've visited a couple times, once by myself and once with my partner. The first time I visited, we ordered a large sweet and sour pork, the thai style chicken, and sweet potato with plum powder. The sweet and sour pork was about average and tasty enough- it was a little over fried and the sauce was good but nothing new or exciting. The large portion is good for sharing or for one person who is particularly hungry. My partner ate mostly the thai style chicken and in my opinion, it was tastier and better value than the sweet and sour pork. I ordered the sweet potatoes out of curiosity and by the time it came out (it came out after our entrees) both of us were pretty full. It tasted like extra-sweet and tangy sweet potato fries. A good starter if you enjoy sweet potatoes. I've also had one of their chicken rice sets and it was delightful. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the rice was absolutely delicious but not too oily. I'm not overly familiar with chicken rice so I can't say how it stacks up to other places in the city, though. I ordered an iced coffee to go with it and it was a little on the small side, but up to snuff with other local kopi places. It was a substantial and very thrifty lunch. Service was meager but polite and quite unobtrusive. The interior of the restaurant is very cozy and retro- great for a quick meal alone or with friends! Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",

    "text": "To be honest, I am initially quite skeptical of the place. I always thought hawker centre / coffee shop chicken rice would be the best and most authentic. So when I know there is a restaurant selling chicken rice, I'm like meh... Just another overpriced chicken rice store to cheat the ang-mohs money...However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. For the chicken rice, the rice itself is actually tasty and flavourful, not too oily. The chicken is fresh, sweet and tender.It is also nice that they serve a variety of other foods. Thos that I have tried include the Tofu, Pork Ribs, Kang Kong, Fried Egg. All of which are of pretty above average standard. So, honestly, if I am around town and want some good chinese food, this is where I will go! \u00a0:)",
