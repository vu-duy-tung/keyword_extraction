    "text": "Best steamed chicken rice I've ever eaten; it's always been a family favorite. The rice is full of flavor, unlike the rice some of the other joints. The chicken itself was moist, not dry. They're also known for their crispy tofu, which is lightly breaded and fried so the middle of the tofu is still soft. Their fish head curry is also worth a try! If you want roasted chicken rice, they have another outlet a few doors down that has both! :)",

Standards have maintained somewhat similar over the years despite being around for decades. The only negative point has nothing to do with Pow Sing but more about the limited parking within Serangoon Gardens.",

    "text": "Taken here for lunch on Monday. Boy this place is noisy! Even though we dont sit closely to each other, lots of chattings in the house going on. Prolly a good place if you dont wanna hear ur parents nag.The food is good! We had rice, chicken, char siew, bittergourd fish soup & an eggish spinach for 4 ladies. Kind of over ordered as i feel very full despite eating half of my rice. And im nt a small eater. :) All the dishes taste good. But nothing to rave about the chicken rice chilli. Its not the garlicky kind i prefer. I love the chicken, smooth & tender. \u00a0Bill comes up to $56 which is very reasonable. I would return for a lunch on a weekend. Am not ready to eat such a heavy meal and return to the office/go to bed.",

But on our the last few visits, the chicken is too salty, the rice is not fragrant like last time where it is good enough to eat on its own. Sigh.I have not gone back for a while now. I MISS OLDIES!",

    "text": "I have always like the food at Pow Sing even though I don't dine there very often. Being in Serangoon Gardens, traffic and parking can be a nightmare, especially during peak hours i.e. meal times. Fortunately there is a valet service for Pow Sing customers, so that does take care of the parking problem. I was there for dinner last night and the food was still as good. Fish head curry - a bit spicy, with more Indian spices rather than Chinese style. The fish is fresh with firm sweet meat. Love the eggplants and okras in it, not overcooked like other places. Nonya crispy tofu - amazingly good. crispy on the outside and silky smooth soft on the inside.Ayam buah keluak - love the slight tart and spicy gravy. chicken could be a bit more tender. buah keluak was good, the opening was quite big so you could dig into the nutty black flesh with your spoon or fork.stuffed you tiao (salad flour roll) - quite normalsweet and sour pork - quite usual toofried eggplant with pork floss - cut into round pieces and deep fried. it was also crispy and crunchy, but being deep fried, a bit too oily for my liking. steamed chicken - tender chicken meat which was very smooth to the tastebakwan kepiting soup - quite tasty, meatball was nothing to write aboutstir-fry sweet potato leaves - fresh and nicely doneYou could choose regular white rice or chicken rice (fragrant) rice. The portion was quite small when compared to other places as the bowl they used was the small type. To note: Chinese tea came in individual mug, not a pot.The dishes I would order again - fish head curry, ayam buah keluak, crispy tofu, stir fry vegetables. Chicken rice.",

It's more famous sister Pow Sing Restaurant is just a few doors away.I love the Roasted Chicken Rice here, and I daresay its the best chicken rice I've ever tasted, and the standard I put other chicken rice stalls up to. It's gotten a little bit more expensive now it's become a restaurant instead of just a hawker stall, but I still love it just as much. You can get other Zi Char type of food here now; I've only ever done take away because I'm not fond of queues, but if there's just one thing you should eat, make it the chicken rice, yum~",

Look no further! Pow Sing offers a great combination of authentic Chicken Rice with good Nyoya Food. For the adventurous at heart, try mixing their fish head curry with black pepper venison over a plate of chicken rice. Absolutely foodgasmic! The nyonya selection is great and there's always something for everyone. With free valet parking and yes, you'll need it during the weekends, this is the place to go with the family for a good sunday dinner. Great place to showcase to visiting overseas friends who want a good sample of local food. Prices have steadily increased over the years and thus no longer as affordable as it was back then.Be prepared to spend an average of S$25 per person or more.",

It's one of those \"comfort food\" type places, and you know you're always going to get good food.They've diversified quite a bit, so you can you can get a lot more than just chicken rice, if that tickles your fancy. The last time I was there, our greedy table of five ordered the fish head curry, hae chor, sambal kangkong, hotplate tofu... in addition to our whole chicken, and goodness know what else, perhaps because my brain could only process the fact that I needed to put the food in my mouth.Always safe, always tasty, and not too expensive, this place get crowded on the weekends too, so it looks like it's not just a tradition for me then.",
