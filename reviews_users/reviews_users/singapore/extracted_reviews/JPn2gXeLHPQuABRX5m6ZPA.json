When I got the plate, my noodles were already cold, dry, and clumped together. The cut of chicken I had was the rear boney part near the chicken butt and didn't have much meat to it. I liked the spicy sauce they have on the side table and the little bit of sauce they smeared on the plate next to the noodles too. The flavor was good, but I just don't see how this beats other Cantonese options.The $5 plate is also a pretty small portion. Many people order a side of vegetables or other cuts of meats to make it a whole meal.This is definitely not something I'd go back for.",

Its chicken wasnt the best in sg too(similar tenderness can be found in other chicken rice stalls though they are not awarded the Michelin starIts noodle is also not the best in sg): do read tripadvisor for more truthIt should not embark so fast on a pompus expansion plan to Bangkok , Taiwan etc ctriesHawker Chan stall should be called \"Chan Geng\" (that means in Cantonese, previously once), now no longer a good Hawker Chan",

On my second attempt I went on a Saturday around 11am and was pretty surprised there wasn't much of a line. This changed about an hour later when I was leaving.- Though they are famous for their soya chicken, there are so many options! I almost feel like I shouldn't write this review until I've tried more than one dish. \u00a0I had the soya chicken with rice. The dish was $3.50+and extra .50 to choose my part (I chose breast). \u00a0Waited about 15 mins (not bad). \u00a0The chicken was indeed very flavorful, as was the rice! \u00a0However in hindsight, I wold have gotten the thigh or leg. The breast was a little dry for me, and there wasn't much skin or sauce to moisten the meat. \u00a0My fault - I went by myself. If I went with others, we could have had more dishes to try out! \u00a0Rest assured, I will be coming back here again if I get to go back!",

I live in Chinatown, NY and definitely can't get better chicken there than in Singapore. The skin on the chicken just has this texture that was unbelievable. Oily and slippery, yet hearty and firm; the chicken was delicious.Highly highly recommend this joint.Mmmm sogoooo.",

The stand opens at 10:30 am and by 10:20 people were starting to queue (the queue begins across from the stand and snakes around the other stands). I like the fact that they call customers up one by one so that you don't feel rushed or jostled while you are ordering. We got our food by 10:55 or so, so not a bad wait at all. We ordered half a chicken and one order of soy sauce chicken over rice along with a side of veggies for good measure. The chicken - even the white meat - is velvety tender and juicy which is challenging to find. The \"soy sauce\" sauce is the right balance of sweet and salty. I saw a number of locals getting the chicken with rice but I'm a purist and like it with rice. As we were leaving at around 11:45, the line was only a little bit longer than when we first started standing in line at 10:20 but I heard it gets unmanageable by 1 pm.",

    "text": "Reposting my review here from the previous Yelp page that now says \"closed\" despite it only having a name change:This review is for the actual Liao Fan Hong Kong food stall (now known as Hawker Chan) instead of the Hawker Chan restaurant which opened after the Michelin Star was earned. Yelp is a bit confusing in that reviewers are posting reviews for both locations on multiple businesses which all have different addresses. The food stall is located on the second floor of the Chinatown Complex, which is across the street from the air conditioned sit-down restaurant. The reason I chose to eat at the stall is because the prices are cheaper and the food is \"supposedly\" better. Also, if I'm going to come all the way here - it's better to eat at the original right? (Especially since Hawker Chain restaurant chains are now popping up all over the world). The soya sauce chicken noodle is the dish that earned this place a Michelin Star. At the stall it is S$2.50 (super cheap for a Michelin Star meal!) I also ordered a char siew rice which was also $2.50. There are some other menu items that also looked delicious like the soya sauce chicken rice, roasted pork rice, and the chicken hor fun. Most dishes are S$3 and under. Let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The noodles were cooked well. I love that they poured their delicious sauces all over my plate. Was it amazing? I'm not sure. There are a lot of other stalls in the area serving the same exact dish and most of them are also really delicious. I'm not sure what makes the chicken stand out. The char siew, however, was really good - I liked it more than the chicken.Overall, I think my expectations were too high because of this place's popularity and its star. The only reason we came here was to try the \"cheapest Michelin Star meal in the world\". I'm not sure if I would come here again and wait in the really long line. Comparing this place to other one Michelin Star restaurants I would give it a four star (good food at a very cheap price). Comparing this place to other Hawker stalls I would give it a five star.",

They received their award in 2017, which was the year I was there. Was I excited? Of course.Let's talk food.The chicken truly is delicious, but what makes it even more delectable is the rice and the sauce. The chicken is glazed in some sort of sauce that pretty much seeped through the soft chicken skin. Every bite, mixed with the rice is just heaven. To top it off, the pork dish is delightful too. It's the perfect consistency of fat and meat. The egg sprouts on the side just compliments the entire ensemble.Verdict? This is a true Michelin. Cheap yet delicious.",

Nothing tough or out of place (all the rice cooked well).I would stick to the classic chicken and rice. The noodles were average.",

The chicken itself was cooked really well, and I thought it was roasted quite nicely. Unfortunately that's where the benefits end. The seasoning was quite mediocre, it tasted a little bland in some place. The rice was terrible and low quality tasting. The sauces and accompaniments taste like the typical items you can get from any other average hawker stand.The good part though, is that the price was super low. At around $2 a plate, it was a steal. But unfortunately a low price doesn't justify the wait, and I guess my expectations coming in were too high because of the Michelin Star.",

Waited in line foreverrr - it took about 40 min til I got to the front of the line to put in my order! Started waiting in line at about 10:20 am on a Friday. Ordered the soya chicken and rice as well as the veggie dish - both were good. Was it better than the brick and mortar store? Yes, the rice was better and not cold and hard like at the other location. Was it worth the wait? I don't think so, but glad I gave it a shot.",

This is not the original location, but one of the other brick & mortar locations.I had so many similar dishes at home - and I thought to myself, \"what could possibly be so different?\" The answer is a lot of things. First off is the pricing. You can get an entire meal for less than 5 USD which is a steal!!The signature dish is the Soya chicken. The chicken was extremely flavorful and the sauce is subtle. The chicken falls right off the bone and that's when you know you got some high quality meat.Next up is the triple pork platter which was basically chinese bbq pork cooked in three different ways. Honestly I like this better than the Soya chicken. It's hard to explain and put into words, but trust me it's a beautiful explosion in your mouth.",
