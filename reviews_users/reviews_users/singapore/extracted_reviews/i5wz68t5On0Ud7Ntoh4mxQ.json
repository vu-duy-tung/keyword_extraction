The staff is fantastic and extremely professional, the food is outstanding, and the wine-list is spectacular. Make sure you have an Anna de Codorniu cava glass to start with.Location is perfect, and they have several events with winemakers and chefs, which makes the place that much more special.Excellent choice!",

OLA is a rarity in Singapore for waiving corkage if you are a regular. Service is excellent, especially the very knowledgeable sommelier.Will be back!",

Does not feel busy though the customers are consistently filing in.The roast pork is definitely the highlight, squid ink rice and pasta deserves a mention. I would reorder those again during my next visit.Price is high, but for the location and ambiance it is reasonable.",

The Seafood Pasta and the Fisherman's Seafood Stew were filling yet delicately light. We ordered Frutas for dessert and today's seasonal fruit was melon. Very succulent and delicious with homemade vanilla ice cream! Would come back for the friendly service and amazing food :)",

    "text": "The cosy restaurant, innocuously tucked away at the commercial hub that is MBFC, has been surreptitiously churning out Spanish cuisine with a Peruvian inclination. It's totally underrated, and flies so low under the radar, that it was 3 years before I learned of its illustrious lineage: Ola's head chef was the executive chef of the short-lived celebrity restaurant Santi at MBS.Dinner-time will find the restaurant a lot more chilled and tranquil, compared to the frenzied boisterousness of the lunchtime crowd. I much prefer dinners here; there's a languorous ambience perfect for savouring OLA's exquisite tapas. Service is also a lot more intimate and attentive. We had:1) 36-months aged Jamon Iberico '5J' ($48): sublime fatty salty ribbons of cured pork shoulder sided by catalan toasts and fresh tomato puree. Pricey, but sublime nonetheless.2) Burrata with Pesto ($35) with heirloom tomatoes, edamame, and crispy jamon curls: an off-menu special that was a fantastic recommendation by the affable manager. Incredibly balanced in terms of flavour and texture, this is a must-try if ever it's in season.3) Gambas ($25) - of fresh sweet prawns swimming in a medley of roasted garlic oil, dried chilli, and espelette pepper: heady and aromatic. Dish with the complimentary crusty bread, great fodder for the robustly flavoured oil.4) Pulpo ($26): Spanish octopus grilled to a luscious and smoky finish, and complemented by a nutty lentil sauce, and lightly spiced romesco vinaigrette. I'm not a fan of octopus (the tentacles scare me), but even I was blown away by this.5) Conchas a la Parmesana ($35): a duo of plump Hokkaido scallops baked to a succulent caramelization, was set atop parmesan grains, and a creamy lime and brandy aioli. Decent, but not outstanding.6) Fiduea con Secreto Iberico y Setas ($45): loved the flavourful noodle paella dish loaded with organic oyster mushrooms and grilled iberico pork, even if my galfriend found its sweet undertones disconcerting.7) Ceviche ($25): only lackluster dish where the potent taste of the wild seabass overwhelmed the delicate flavours of the lime, chilli, and onion marinade",

    "text": "firstly, if you are driving, you have to park at MBFC tower 2 and then walk over to tower 3.the setting here is cozy and rustic.the wait staff were all really friendly and proactive.staff to customer ratio is also above average standard.their sparkling san pellegrino was $7.50 and not the usual $12 that i've come to expect.their sangria which was rated as 11/10 by one of their staff, had a good proportion of chopped fruits in it.to our pleasant surprise, chef pepe came to our table just as we were about to order.he made some friendly banter and asked if we trust him to do the ordering for us.we immediately closed the menu and gladly left it all to him.to start off was their rustic bread and gazpacho.refreshingly chilled with the right acidity and 2 halves of tomatoes inside.next up was a gourmet starter of the day.a burrata, jamon salad with fresh figs and tomatoes.nice creamy burrata, savoury jamon and the sweetest figs ever!then the morcon, cured spanish pork sausage with paprika on crunchy toasted bread.the piquillo, peppers stuffed with salt cod, was a nice warm combo of spicy, sweet and saltiness.the calamares, was fresh and lightly fried with a tasty squid ink sauce.my favourite of the evening has to be the pulpo, char grilled octopus with paprika and potatoes.very tender to the knife and bite.no chewiness whatsoever.plus a good amount of seasoning to make you crave for more.the main event for the night was their suckling pig, which was not even on the menu.wafer \u00a0thin crisp skin with thick flesh of porkiness.served with mushrooms, leeks and mesclun leaves.for dessert, we had the crema catalana, creme brulee with orange scent that was not cloyingly sweet.and peras al vino tinto, red wine pears with cinnamon cake and honey ice cream that concluded my evening in sweet sophistication and style.throughout the evening, chef pepe was at hand to chat and solicited our comments.this was a 4.5 verging on 5 stars experience.",

    "text": "It's sometimes hard to rate a restaurant that does one thing brilliantly well, but everything else is mediocre. That's kinda the case with Ola. The gazpacho here is worth 5 stars. No doubt about it, hands down the best I've had in Singapore. I almost wanted to order one for dessert, it was that good. Coupled with the rustic, crusty bread they serve? Heavenly.Everything else though? Good but unspectacular. For tapas, we had the grilled octopus, the calamari, and the croquettas. I enjoyed all three, to be fair, but the grilled octopus, while tasty, wasn't quite there in terms of texture, and didn't quite match up to my standard for grilled octopus here in Singapore. The calamari was... interesting, I enjoyed the sauces, it was fresh, well cooked, but not... mind-blowing, if you know I mean. It was good, but not memorable. Croquettas. I love croquettas, and the ones here are definitely worth ordering... but not worth going to the restaurant for. Crisp, creamy, generously sized, personally (and this really is a personal thing) I think it could have used a little bit more potato to offset the creaminess. Some people like creamy though, so don't let me discourage you from trooping down to give it a try.For mains we ordered the seafood stew and the paella. The paella... was average. I preferred BOMBA's, and we didn't even finish it because it wasn't really attention grabbing in terms of flavour or texture. The seafood stew was fresh, and a very generous portion, but the broth was a little thin for it to be a 4 or 5 star dish.The Sangria however, was EXCELLENT. If you're a fan of sangria that's fruity, light, and refreshing, then you'll love Ola's. So... yeah. I'm admittedly a little picky and don't hand out 4 or 5 star ratings that easily, but Ola was a pleasant meal, and they're worth visiting (or even revisiting). But I wouldn't say \"I'm a fan\".",
