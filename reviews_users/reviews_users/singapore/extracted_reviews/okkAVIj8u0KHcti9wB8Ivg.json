The thing that I was not impressed with was the portion size. My sons meal came out and it was a large portion, plenty of food. My girlfriends meal came out and there was barley enough food to cover the bottom of her plate. My meal was somewhere in between those two. For $20SPD each I'd expect more.There are plenty of other places to eat right around there, I'd give somewhere else a try.",

    "text": "After having been to Italy, I know what amazing pasta tastes like! To be honest, I picked this place with the family after walking around Singapore for a few hours. It was hot out, I wanted to replace and I prefer Italian over Asian food. We were seated pretty quickly and there was a decent selection of food to pick from, which made it great as a vegetarian. The location is great, right off the river. You can either sit outside along the river, or inside the small restaurant, which has AC. We sat inside to cool off from our day. We ordered pretty quickly and the waiter was good about making sure we had enough water. I selected the gnocchi with pesto sauce, which honestly was pretty dang good, but the portion size was very small especially compared to some of the other plates that came out. The only downside was the portion size, otherwise I would recommend this little spot to others!",

    "text": "My friends and I came here for the free flow promotion which I saw advertised both on Facebook as well on Instagram. I wanted to do a booking online for a Monday evening but when I tried it said that Monday was their off day. Weird since they mention a promotion on Monday's? Anyways, I called and made a reservation and I enquired about the free flow and they did confirm that it was still on.When we arrived, we were seated at a nice table near the river, and we ordered 5 times the free flow but \u00a0were told after that the free flow is only in their 3rd level lounge. So we decided to go upstairs and order 5 x the promo, only to learn that you had to pay downstairs first . So down again... when we tried to pay, only then we learned that it was impossible to get 5 times the free flow and one alacarte (since one of my friends is pregnant). In the end, we ended up eating all alacarte at our original table which was ok, but it would have been nice to have been told so at the start so we could have been spared of walking up and down the stairs.The food was not bad but nothing special either, the calamari were nicely done (not a chewy batter job as you get so often) and the burrata with parma ham was delicious. We also had three pasta dishes: truffle ravioli, spaghetti puttanesca & penne arrabiata, a pizza, a meat dish, some bruscetta and a salad, all of them were just a-ok.Overall, the view and atmosphere near the river is ok, but the food and the service is nothing special, to me this is an unremarkable place so we will probably look for another place to get drinks and dinner next time.",

    "text": "Until this day, I remember my friend telling me \"if you're craving for Pasta, Pasta Fresca is the best!\".Well sadly, this statement was uttered some 7+ years ago and perhaps their glory days are long behind them.We came from Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM) and was on our way to Namu Korean Dining at the end of Boat Quay. However, we were starving and Riverfront dining looks good and thus, we decided to make have dinner at Pasta Fresca - which was one of the few shops that we walked past.Funnily, there was only one waiter taking orders from the guests seated outside. Not sure if there will be a bigger crowd later on but one waiter? Come on.Anyway, the service was pretty slow in terms of order-taking but our food came pretty fast, much to our surprise.Verdict:Spaghetti Amatriciana - Why is the spaghetti so thick??! It looks that it was soaked in hot water for too long. The sauce/toppings were ok, no complains.Al Funghi E Asparagi - Sauce was delicious and flavourful. My partner order Linguini to go with this and the pasta was done al dente. Perfect.Minstrone soup - Priced at $16 you'd would expect something better but all we got was a small serving of vegetables in plain soup. Soup that tasted very bland. A very poor excuse for soup.",

    "text": "I chose this place for late lunch today because I didn't fancy any of the Asian cuisines. The place is by the river so you have a nice view siting outside and they have fans on to keep you cool. I enjoyed a cocktail which was made of mango and prosecco... Nice! I had the starter garlic bread with mozzarella. I think I should have gone for the bruschetta to get some more flavour. I had the mushroom crepes for my main and needed to add pepper to give it some more flavour.",

    "text": "This is my favourite branch of this Italian chain, due to the option to sit by the river. It's really pleasant to just kick back after a long week or day and feel the evening breeze blowing through your hair. On the downside, the sitting capacity of the restaurant immediately halves if it rains too heavily as you wouldn't want to sit outside.I've never tried anything else here by the pizza, and they're good stuff. The crust is hot and yummy, and the ingredients fresh. If you're not too sure what to order, give the margherita a go before ordering anything else, as I believe that you can tell how good a restaurant's pizza will be through its most basic dish.I'm a big fan of the marinara and the vegetariana. If you're feeling in the mood, you can give their selection of wines a shot. All the fancy wines in bottles are pretty expensive, but you can always get a glass of house pour for S$8.30. Or, if you're like me, you'll stop pretending you understand wine and just order a beer instead! ;)",

So I know a little thing or two about italian food and cooking it. This place? Just skip it. Totally not worth the heavy price tag of paying about $100 for 2 people, though that is with a glass of wine and beer. The squid ink pasta, lack luster. I've definitely had better. The same was with my dish which was spinach ravioli in a red sauce with olives and anchovies. Even the tiramisu was lackluster at best. My mom makes a KILLER tiramisu which she learned from my dad. It's hard to beat that authenticity. I can honestly make these dishes at home and they'll taste the same as this, if not better, but with a cheaper price tag.",

    "text": "My friends were in shock when I told them I never tried Pasta Fresca till this year - apparently it was every family's restaurant of choice back when we were younger. Must be that crazy jingle that kept playing on TV - I can still hum the tune from vague recollection.So, I finally tried it and I can see why all my friends have fond memories of it. It is a little bit like Jack's place, the Italian edition (and with better food). The interior decor makes for a nice casual date or dinner with a large group. I had the mushroom and vegetarian pizzas and both were pretty good - the base was not to thick and they were very generous with the toppings. The vegetarian is probably the winner because of the effort taken to char-grill the vegetables which gave the pizza an extra kick of flavour. Will be back for more, have to make up for lost time!",

Pasta Fresca serves hearty home style \u00a0Italian food which is rather heavy( chunky tomato sauce and cream sauce) unlike your modern Italian restaurant. I am not a huge fan of such Italian cooking but a single dish that demands praise would be their Seafood Marinara pasta, the spicy flavors are great with the chunky tomato sauce and seafood mix. With that said Pasta Fresca also serves a decent brick stove cooked pizza. The view facing the river does indeed make up for the slightly under par food.",
