I was enticed by the poster for roti prata, but unfortunately the chef was away taking his break, as it was 2.20 pm then.So we decided to order curry chicken brayani, vadi and teh tarik. This was our first time visiting Prata Wala and tried their food. We were surprized that the curry chicken and brayani was good. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our lunch, and will certainly visit Prata Wala again, and this time hopefully the roti prata will be available. Not only was the food great, Sebastian, who took our order was friendly and helpful. Richard Lee",

    "text": "This would be a 3.5 stars place. Food is good though the price is on the high side. My issue with the place will be the random overcharging, especially if you order the briyani (they automatically charged the dum briyani version even if you ordered the regular) and the dishes. Just check your receipt and or watch them key in the order as they tend to mix up the items ordered too. I like the teh tarik, prata (I still don't get why you need to order min 2 plain prata when you just want 1 plain prata and 1 egg/onion prata which makes up 2 pieces of prata anyway. Sometimes they will allow that but not all the time, depends on who is manning the cashier.), briyani and vadai. There is usually a line and it may be hard to find an empty table at times. I usually just grab a seat at the big table which can be shared by many diners. The wrap is so-so. I will just go for the usual prata and teh tarik.",

Eventhough they have 7-8 working staff they take long time to serve your food. And they are very poor in handling customers. When they finished some item they can advice some other item with a minute of patience and smiling face than reluctant one.",

    "text": "1) Egg prata - so good!!! best egg prata in the country! (dare I say) - thin, light and slightly crispy on the outside while remaining fluffy and tasty on the inside. Not oily too so it feels less sinful. - makes me reconsider naan as my #2 favorite India carb. haha... - note: the curry that accompanies this was most probably a vegetarian based curry and not chicken curry (because we had order both, we could tell the difference). 2) Prata set (3 plain pratas & 1 curry chicken) - value for money! - the chicken curry sauce was thicker and more flavorful than the vegetable based one. - chicken meat was average only.3) drinks - teh-tarik: was good but THE WAIT for it was almost 30mins (on a saturday)??? amazingly the wait for drinks was longer than the food. the drink connoisseur really took her time making them. Service- there's always a queue but it is pretty efficient, although I would recommend going on a weekday rather than a weekend because NEX gets crazy packed.",

However, it tasted the same as what I could get in the usa. So, either they have pretty authentic Indian food in usa or this place is average - not sure.Atmosphere was nice. Needed more seats.

    "text": "I like the atmosphere at Nex's Prata Wala. Since it's an island stall, you get to people-watch and soak in the shopping spirit whilst eating. It's understandable that a Prata outlet located inside a shopping mall will demand much more out of your wallet than humble neighbourhood coffee shops. \u00a0Even so, one will expect higher priced food to taste even better than those found in the heartlands, right? Wrong, apparently. Although Prata Wala at Nex serves some pretty good beverages like sweet Lassi and thick, delicious ice milo, the food isn't as extraordinary. Both times I ordered Garlic Naan and they came to me in a mildly burnt state. The garlic flavour was barely there, or perhaps overwhelmed by the naan's burnt circumstance. The Masala Thosai on the other hand costs quite a fair bit at $4, which is a little overpriced for my liking. I've tasted better and more fulfilling Masala Thosai at neighbourhood coffee stalls that can go for only $2.50. The individual dishes like Mysore Mutton are quite tasty but not worth the $6++ that they entail.",

    "text": "When in doubt, have prata!...was what I thought when I couldn't decide what to have for lunch on a Saturday afternoon in Nex. The shop was busy, and I liked that you could see the 'prata man' through a glass window working his magic. I thought the prices here were typical of most Indian-Muslim food shops, considering inflation has brought the price of prata up at least threefold in the last ten years. I ordered my usual, prata plaster (prata with a sunny-side-up plastered to one side, egg yolk runny and all). It was $2. The prata dough was 'ok, ok only' as my friend put it and as I agreed, but it was crispy so that was good. Of course, I had an iced Milo to go with it. The place is quite hard to miss; on the second level of Nex near the escalator, facing New Zealand Natural Caf\u00e9.",

    "text": "This prata shop beckoned to me even before I saw it with its smell of Indian spices. It's an \"island\" restaurant in the middle of pedestrian traffic, and definitely caught attention with its glass windows which let you watch the chefs at work. The queue is also quite sizeable, and that's usually an indicator of good food, right?Unfortunately, the food here is nothing to shout about. I'm not sure how you review a piece of fried dough, but the prata was in fact wholly unremarkable. But on the upside, at least it was made on the spot, and was hot and crispy.And then there's the price. It's not really expensive, but it's not exactly cheap either. An egg prata demands S$2, while fancier dishes like briyani rice and tandoori chicken will go northwards of S$6.50.",
