When I ask my Singaporean friends why they encourage and support such poor service I am told that they don't see being a waiter as a profession - well take a closer look - it's a demonstration of a lack of pride and poor taste Singapore!Odette stands out as a first class restaurant. \u00a0The 8 or so courses are all very well executed.. and if you can afford the price and can wait-out the extended calendar for a reservation - you must experience this elegant dining.",

His strictly local talent is incredible and the imagination is showcased in the dishes is beautiful. You can tell every chef and employee works hard yet loves what they do with all of their smiles. There is no pretentiousness like I'm noticing after the Stars have been awarded like in other restaurants where there once was no such thing (e.q. Corner House).I agree with Nik T that Odette was always in the shadows of the more adventurous and experimental Andre but now that the latter has closed its doors, Odette truly shines above all other Singapore Michelin Stars. The dishes are beautiful and full of flavor as well as many courses with the bells and whistles of dry ice and smoke.The ambiance is comfortable but the staff quickly makes you feel at home, very conversational and full of knowledge and warmth. Although this is a typical long tasting menu dinner, if there was any in Singapore to spend on that is uniquely Singapore, definitely do Odette.",

    "text": "Odette is the latest hyped restaurant in Singapore and for our wedding anniversary, seemed to be a befitting location to celebrate by indulging. Dinner menus are priced $208 and $268 for 6- or 8-courses respectively. \u00a0Note that the 6-course dinner is not available from Friday and Saturday. Vegetarian menus are available too. We took both the normal menus to try. Upon seating, we were asked which type of water we would like, still or sparkling. $9/person free flow seemed reasonable. Tap is available for free though. First up were canap\u00e9s. 4 bite-sized delights. All quite tasty (sorry can't remember the details). Followed by amuse bouche of mushroom \"tea\". This was good, full of umami though that a half piece of brioche as a chaser was unnecessary in my view. Then the bread platter arrived. A piece of tree bark was used in place of a plate. Presentation was great! 3 different types of bread were served - chia seed focaccia was our favorite, but the sourdough wedge was lovely too. The thyme brioche was the weakest link. The flavor wasn't intense enough to make any impact. Two different butters were served - salted lardo (yes, it's piggy fat) and unsalted butter. Then the meal was served proper. I shan't go into details of each plate but they were all well presented and tasty. But I wouldn't say it's overwhelming impressive, especially if they are aiming for the Michelin star. Service was choppy, my glass of water was empty for a good while before it was noticed and topped up. Most of the servers are foreigners and cannot enunciate their words properly. Dinner ended with petit fours, the lemon meringue lollipop was the most interesting and best of the lot. Canele was a close second though. A good experience overall but I won't be in a hurry to come back. Maybe for the less pricy lunch but not otherwise.",

    "text": "Odette has probably been the most talked about restaurant in town for the last few months. The limited number of tables available and the fairly egalitarian reservation policy is a big factor, though some would say Julien is the biggest pull and who doesn't want to see the insides of the Supreme Court anyway? The wait time for a table on the weekend now stands at about 1.5 months, though cancellations do happen so I recommend calling up the hostess to leave your number. Fine dining restaurants usually have a \"money table\" and another for last minute special people but this doesn't exist at Odette, which I found out after several people came back to me empty handed.So was it worth the wait? I think the restaurant has a lot of potential and I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch, but I didn't walk away with my mind blown. So the answer is... \"I guess so\". There are clear signs of greatness in the attention to detail in plating picturesque dishes, the variety of flavors and textures and some theatrical sauce-pouring and smoke. The price point is incredible value as well at $128 for 6 creative courses. Plus I love the design of the restaurant - it makes one feel calm, uncluttered and chic. I liked my amuse bouche, pork belly and bread (don't laugh...the restaurants that ace bread-making tend to make great food too) but I was also bored by the play it safe ingredient list: Truffles in every other fish? Check. Pork belly? Check. Foie gras? Check. Given how well the dishes were executed, why not be adventurous with the produce? I've heard the French are as nose-to-tail happy as Chinese to some degree after all. There lies the problem I suppose - I didn't think any dish was bad but I didn't find anything so unique or memorable that I could recall its name or contents a week later. Yes I was with a work-related acquaintance and so my mind wasn't 100% focused on the food, but I tried Per Se in a similar context and could still remember the piece of SRF slow cooked beef I had that melted in my mouth, the famous pearls and the insane ending line-up of desserts. I will end by saying that I'm still tempted to return to try the dinner degustation because the chefs could have been limited by the affordable price point required at lunchtime. In a way, I think the food at Odette is like a straight A student at the PSLE exams - schooled in good techniques and scoring points, but needs to use that to express some real creativity and risk to achieve greatness. \u00a0Let's see what happens.",
