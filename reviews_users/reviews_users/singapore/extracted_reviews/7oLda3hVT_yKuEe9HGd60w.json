    "text": "QUACK QUACK QUACK.... Yum!I am a meat lover and duck must be one of my favorite meats, I like it in all forms: crispy shredded duck, canard a l'orange, duck confit, cantonese duck but foremost Peking Duck.I came here on a weekday night, I made reservations but I guess it was not really necessary as the restaurant was half empty. We ordered a duck to be split between the two of us (as you cannot order a half duck), which turned out into a real duck fest.The Peking duck is sliced in front of you, you get to eat the crispy skin first, then the traditional Peking pancake way and afterwards they offer to cook up the leftovers as you wish: we opted for the fried rice. These three preparations were much more than we could eat but fortunately they offered to wrap them up neatly so we could feast on them again.It is a tad on the pricey side but the service is good and the duck is probably one of the better duck dishes to be found in Singapore.Would I go again? Yes - I might try the outlet at Paragon next time as it is more popular (so even better?)",

    "text": "Love the duck. You can't order half a duck. Those are their rules, which suits me fine as I will happily make a meal with my partner of just Peking duck and duck part 2 and we will be content. They serve it with flour pancakes over those skimpy and bleh 'egg' pancakes, which is just plain wrong. Your second dish with the remaining duck meat can be a few choices: rice, lettuce wrapped, deep fried with the bones and other options. We usually chose flat rice noodle, dry, with shredded duck meat. Delectable. At this location, it's a business crowd at lunch. In the evenings a mix of patrons dine here. I like avoiding the much busier Paragon location. Service here like most Imperial Treasure locations is attentive. Grab a booth if you can for a more relaxed dining experience. Highly recommended for when you have that Peking duck craving.",

    "text": "I love imperial treasure super duck. However, there is a reason why the original outlet at Paragon is perpetually full and reservation a necessity.Although they have the same menu, the one at Paragon is much better. Taste-wise, this place definitely falls short. We tried the exact same dishes that we always get there: Peking duck, deep-fried frog legs with ginger, Mee pok with truffle. All were better at the other place. Save your calories, book earlier and go to the outlet at Paragon.",

The food was AWESOME. \u00a0The best part (for me) was that I got the vegetarian option for the set meal that the host ordered, and every dish presented was outstanding. \u00a0The first was a clear soup served in a steamed winter melon (at least I think it was a winter melon). Everything was so good. \u00a0I tried a little Peking Duck (delicious) and deep fried bao with Chili Crab sauce- sooo good. \u00a0I think the meal was pretty pricey but it was a great experience!",

    "text": "After a rough Monday morning, Imperial Treasure dim sum takeout is my ultimate pick me up lunch! \u00a0While I do enjoy eating at the restaurant, advance reservations are absolutely essential for weekday lunch and the management is militant about ensuring that there are two seatings. \u00a0That means if you go for the 11:45am seating, you must be out by 1pm.Because of this policy and because I am not particularly moved by the Peking duck itself (not enough flavor), I usually opt to order take out lunch. \u00a0It only takes about 10-15 mins to get dim sum and I like to take a small break sitting on a couch in the bar area to catch my breath and figure out the action plan for the afternoon.After rigorous experimentation (on myself), I've reached the conclusion that the perfect amount of food for lunch is between 2 and 3 orders of dim sum. \u00a0Of course, my greedy self tends to go for 3 orders. \u00a0Make sure you get some of the chili oil...I believe they make it in house and it is awesome, spicy and slightly garlicky.PARTING THOUGHT: While everything is good, do yourself a favor and try the crispy rice roll. \u00a0It's a crispy fried shimp roll then covered in a layer of perfectly steamed rice roll...consume quickly for maximum crispyness! \u00a0Absolutely divine and I don't think they offer it at all locations! \u00a0I have never had it anywhere else!",

    "text": "One of my all time favorite dishes is the Peking Duck... Haven't found a good one in Singapore until I checked out Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck Restaurant @ Paragon. \u00a0 We got to know that they have another outlet at Asia Square and decided that this time round, we would check out the one there. We were there on a tuesday evening and the place was not very packed. Haha we were almost not comfortable with the quietness of the place compared to the paragon outlet. \u00a0At least, we are not rushed to finish out dinner within 2 hours limit and the wait staff were more attentive here. Think that they are probably busier during the day since this location targets more of the week day business crowd. The peking duck didn't disappoint us... the right amount of crisps for the skin and the right amount of tenderness for the meat. One plus point is they will do the peking duck wraps for you and serve individual portions vs having to DIY. We ordered 2 peking ducks for 5 of us and tried two difference style of preparation for the duck body. We tried the gong pao and minced duck with cabbage wrap. I find that the gong pao style was a tad salty while the minced duck style was delicious.If you can't get a table or don't want to be hurried thru dinner, do check out this place. Good place for a nice business lunch/dinner.",

The duck was great and the servers made the packets for us which meant that I had to add more hoisin sauce myself... the duck fried rice was surprisingly good. All the elements were subtle and I enjoyed it. It was not the best peking duck I've had but I wish that this was the norm.",
