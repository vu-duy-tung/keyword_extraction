    "text": "I love the prata here. It is nice, soft, and chewy without being too soft and the curry that accompanies the pratas is always on par. My favorites are the marsala prata, the egg onion prata, and the cheese egg prata. Yum!!The thosai (or dosa) here is nice but not nearly as good as the prata. Although, that is my general preference anyways so maybe I'm just being biased. I had the marsala thosai and it was good, but not as flavorful as I would have preferred. There was a really delicious tomato sauce that came with it though and it was really refreshing.The mutton curry biryani that I had here was one of the best biryanis that I've had. The mutton was just perfectly cooked and they give you a good size portion of it too. I feel like I could eat this biryani for the rest of my life... Definitely a must try if you're here.I've also tried the butter chicken here, but this dish didn't really stand out to me. It was a little bland and didn't have a lot going on. I couldn't really taste the butter that I usually do and it was kind of off, in my opinion. I would skip on this dish and try the others.",

Food was all right, but nothing to really rave about. The chicken in the curry was very tender and nice. Didn't sense much passion in the cooking though. At least it's indoors with air-conditioning and wi-fi (to encourage more people to come in?)",

    "text": "My favourite Indian food! They have Roti Prata including Italian Prata, murtabak (Turk-tabak is stuffed with turkey), Oreo Roti Boom is a set of 2 pratas and Oreos and ice cream.They also have Mee/nasi/kway teow goreng, fish head curry, kambing (lamb) soup, tulang (bone marrow) soup/merah, tandoori.There is an air con area but with the passage door open, it isn't cold enough. Maybe it is real Low air con and that's why they have fans.The roti Prata is better than the one at the other end of Clementi Road (near Pasir Panjang). Texture is much better and it is a little crispy.Had half a piece of fish too and curry was slightly warm.Overall a good place for prata.Free wifi too!",

I recommend getting this dish regardless of what else you try. The butter chicken is another good choice of you want the same great chicken along with sauce. The regular curry dishes are good as well. Expect to receive plenty of meat for the price as they don't skimp. I also recommend the garlic naan to go along with your main dishes. It is well crafted and has a lot of flavor.",

I like to buy my Briyani from here whenever I'm hosting a party. The only downside is the popadums become soggy, but thats not their fault. Next time, I think I'm going to eat all the popadums on the way home. I haven't tried anything else but the Bryani here. Have either Fish or chicken, both are delicious. Prata and Mee Hoon goreng seems really popular here too so if you are thinking about giving it a try I think it shouldn't be too bad.",

    "text": "This is a revisit after more than a year. I ordered a fresh \u00a0coconut juice and prawn biryani. But was pushed to order fish with prawn biryani instead. When the coconut drink came, it was floated with coconut fiber. So I sent it back but have to ensure that I didn't drink it. The prawn biryani was so so. The rice was on the sticky side. The amount of prawn was surprisingly generous with one slice of fish. When come to paying, the dish was named food item and cost $15 which is almost double the price of prawn biryani \u00a0as listed on the menu. Lesson learnt, never order what the waiter is pushing. I felt cheated.",

    "text": "Prata Planet offers a wide variety of pratas, both savory and sweet, alongside roti, murtabak, thosai and ala carte South Indian dishes. The kosong (plain) prata was perfect: the fluffy, crispy and flaky layers that were the result of folding the dough over several times. Also, I just loved the taste of freshly-made dough, which had a hint of sweetness to it.I also tried the Cheese and Mushroom Prata. The Prata was fluffy and not oily. It was filled with melting cheese and button mushrooms. Besides Prata, the restaurant also sells Mutton Soup, Thosai and Biryani. I also tried the Chicken Biryani which I thought was pretty decent. Long thin grain rice was used for the Biryani rice. The curry was not too spicy and the chicken was very tender.Overall, I'd highly recommend this place for its amazing pratas!",

Located near Clementi MRT Station, this prata place is not the place to come if you want to have the best prata but to be able to eat some junk in order to wind down and end a stressful day. Have visited this place many times with my best friend, who usually goes for the pratas while I always choose to have the maggie goreng ($3.50). Both of us agree that the portion is not enough for us, but then again, it might be doing us much good by limiting how much we ate at that time of the night. Opening hours: Daily: 630am - 11pm",
