The menu is different as well as the ambience. \u00a0You can make reservation early to get the seats in the restaurant else you mind ended up sitting outside, which is nice on a cool weather only. The food served wasn't properly cooked, the bbq chicken and beef were either too salty or too plain. Upon feedback, the waitress was kind enough to change a new dish for us but the taste was still off the track. If you prefer the outdoor, they have a huge TV that shows some Japanese drum performance continuously, luckily it was on silence, else it would be too disturbing to feast with the drumming sound.",

The yakitori is good but its not why I come here. They have some wasabi prawns which are pretty much consistently good no matter where I've eaten them. \u00a0 \u00a0The service is quick and friendly. \u00a0The atmosphere is interesting and stylish. \u00a0Definitely my go to spot for ramen.",

Was tempted to get the salmon ikura rice (because the picture looked good... rookie mistake I know) but was quickly corrected by my friend that I should get ramen so ramen I got. Ordering the Akamaru Shinaji, I enjoyed their take on \"modern ramen\" because it originates with the traditional tonkotsu broth but adds elements like garlic oil, black fungus, and a special miso paste. The broth is wonderfully rich and flavorful and the noodles had great spring-back texture too. Paired with a tall glass of beer, I was a happy camper. Despite being a busy eatery, the staff are still really attentive as they churn out bowl after bowl of ramen to hungry patrons. Afore mentioned line did grow but the wait isn't that bad so don't let that stop you from trying Ippudo.",

    "text": "First time having Ippudo outside of the States, and I was impressed with the consistency of the quality of the food. Just to note. This Ippudo is no longer called Ippudo x Tao, but now is just \"Ippudo Mohamed Sultan\". Regardless of the name, the food was tremendous.Starting with some aioli potatoes and the pork/shrimp buns, these dishes warmed up the appetite for the forthcoming ramen. Potatoes were soft, but still had some bit to them, so they were not like mashed potatoes; and had really good seasoning. The buns were just as I remember them from New York, except now I was able to enjoy them outside with a cold beer as well. And then there was the ramen. The Hakata Shoyu Special came with pork belly, egg, and seaweed. The broth was hot and flavorful. It was a bit stronger than the New York bowl, but finished a lot more smoothly (strange to be speaking about ramen broth like a whisky or wine - but it was that good). The pork was cooked perfect and added a nice bit of fat to the broth. I could not slurp down the ramen fast enough. If you're a fan of Ippudo, or just ramen in general, this should not be skipped.",

We didn't bother with reservations, and the place wasn't packed (perhaps because it's so close to the restaurants on Robertson Quay). We started with two drinks from their menu: the Cassis Soda (black current liquor with soda and lime) and the Sunshine (cassis with gin and orange juice). They were a bit sweet, but very refreshing and helped with the warmth of the patio seat.We split a number of smaller plates rather than ordering main entrees. They included the potato salad, broccoli, chef's choice veggie skewers, scallops, salmon aburi roll, unagi roll (grilled eel, cucumber and egg, wrapped in a seaweed rice roll covered with flying fish roe), and crab frits. All were delicious and the crab frits were a tasty first for me. I was a fan of the fact that we could eat tapas-style Japanese and thought the food was unique and presented very well. There were many paleo-friendly options available. I'm sure that we'll be back.",

When we took their business card, we noticed there was an Ippudo Tao in UE Square. The next day, I was still craving for Ramen and wanted to try Ippudo but we knew that on a Sunday afternoon the line would be even longer... So I decided to call Ippudo Tao and I was so happy when they said they do take reservations!! So off we went to finally have Ramen :-)I was pleasantly surprised and liked the place a lot. We were seated outside and it was so quiet and relaxing. The staff was really nice and very helpful on the food recommendation. They even ask you how you want your noodles cooked which I found wonderful!! I hate Ramen with soft overcooked noodles...I ordered the Bonito Tonkotsu Special and it is one of the yummiest Ramen i've had in Singapore! It was just delicious with a lovely broth and perfectly cooked chewy noodles. I was so happy to discover this place because not only the Ramen was good, but there was no lineup on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30pm. I will definitely go back!",

I had the pleasure of watching Tao perform but somehow the whole drum noodle collaboration is lost on me. The aesthetic of the restaurant looks really good. It's my favourite color combination, red on black. Although, black on black would be better. The ambience is cosy and warm, it kinda gives you that 'I'm hip because I'm here' kind of feeling. If you're looking for a good deal, the best time to visit this restaurant is weekdays at lunch, I like the Ippudo pork bun and on weekday lunch, you can get 2 pork buns at $5! That's a good bargain. To me, ramen noodles are ramen noodles but having been there twice I was happy with both the Tao Aka and Tao Kuro. I like sitting outside when it's dark (this place opens late so it's a good posh supper place. There's a projector screen outside that plays black and white movies so if your date is boring you'll have something else to look at. I kid, it's a nice visual touch.",

After making a few circles, I finally stumbled upon its unassuming red-and-black exterior, and made my way into the restaurant greeted by an enthusiastic waitress.I ordered the signature Tao Kuro ramen, served in dark Shoyu Tonkotsu (pork bone) broth. The overall taste was similar to what I had in Japan, which is probably a compliment of the highest order: the chewiness of the noodles, the tenderness of the pork slices and the richness of the broth was just right. The egg (\"tamago\"), which is usually the make-or-break factor for me, did not disappoint: its yolk was deliciously runny, giving the near-perfect bowl of ramen its extra oomph. It's safe to say that I'll definitely be a regular patron of Ippudo Tao, despite its slightly higher prices.Reservations are strongly recommended as queues of up to an hour is usual during peak hours.",

    "text": "Between this Ippudo joint and the one in Mandarin Gallery, there is no question that this one trumps in terms of convenience and hours. Great place to start a weekend night and fill your stomach before hitting the hard liquor..The ramen is pretty good. Hearty, tasty broth. Don't forget to mention to the server if you want to get your ramen cooked to a particular tenderness. I always get mine hard. I never tried the kakuni (pork belly) add-on, but the standard pork slices are okay. Not the best I have ever had, but still decent.I think people can afford to skip the famed pork buns. When I was in the States, I always make a point to get a bun whenever I go to Dave Chang joints.. but who needs that when you have plenty awesome kong bak pao stalls in Singapore?",

    "text": "Had a decent lunch here, just the standard ramen with a pork bun on the side. It was good but nothing mind blowing. Staff was a bit pushy and hovered around quite a bit, but maybe that's because it was lunch on a rainy day and there was hardly anybody else there. 3 stars for being on the right side of good.",

    "text": "Decent spot for a ramen fix, if you are in the area. This a branch of the popular spot at Mandarin Gallery, and they've collaborated with a drum group (hence the TAO), so you can watch the drum shows while you eat.I find this the quieter branch (thankfully the drum shows aren't on all the time), and rarely have to wait to get seated.They've got a slightly different menu here too, and I'm particularly fond of the Tao Kuro Special - it's got everything on it, the onsen egg, pork belly (yeah, that's how I roll), and the seaweed too. You can get Ippudo originals here too, but why not try something different?Oh if you come at dinnertime, you can get some kushiyaki/skewers too, I can imagine they'd be great with a couple of beers.p.s. I like to come on weekends, when parking is less of a pain.",

    "text": "I come here more than many of the other ramen shops, even the ones I prefer, because the timings suit me better. When I'm craving ramen at 1 in the morning (which is too often, to the disadvantage of my health perhaps), I come here.It's got ramen till the wee hours of the morning and also hot green tea and Japanese beers or sake to wash it all down with. The big screen plays Tao drumming performances endlessly, so it's a good thing that it's quite pleasant to listen to and not intrusive in any way. I prefer the aka ramen here, although the plain-er Shiro ramen is quite good too, just like the one at the main branch at Mandarin Gallery. I like small, thin noodles so I always switch out the fatter ones for the smaller type of noodles.",

    "text": "After reading rave reviews about the place, my friends and I decided to try it out. Honestly, the ramen is really good, but I don't think it's worth that much of a hype. Besides the fact that we queued for about two hours, we didn't even dare to stay too long and hog the table as there was still a snake-like queue outside the restaurant. Serving only ramen, they offer a whole range of different flavours and soup-base to suit your taste.I should have just stayed on the safe side and ordered the normal soup base. Instead, I ordered the other one and felt it was too salty for my liking. I understand why people call Ippudo as their No.1 ramen shop in Singapore. The ramen noodles is really good and the people there are rather friendly too!Though I refused to share a table with others, my order came in rather fast! In less than 15 mins after we ordered our food, the bowls of piping hot ramen came in! Good food, good service but not worth your 2 hours wait.",
