My favorite persian place in Singapore used to be Shiraz, but rumor has it the head chef there recently moved to Shabestan! We started off with the garlic/dill/spinach yogurt dips which paired fantastically with the warm flatbread. The meat platter of fish/prawns/chicken/lamb kebabs were cooked and seasoned excellently as well as the grilled vegetables. The most impressive was the lamb chops, which we ended up ordering more of. Overall, very impressed and will be back again!",

I had the kashkebadmjune (very famous Persian eggplant dish) as my starter and it was delicious but they only brought one freshly baked small Naan. Why not bring or offer more pieces (it's only a couple of dollars). For my main dish I ordered the Soltani kabob dish and again for a ~$50SGD dish there was not enough white basmati rice and the kabobs seemed 3/4 of the normal length that you'd get anywhere else I've gone. Overall, a fancier place in great location, good food, but I expected to get more for the money I spend.",

But ultimately, the price point was a bit high for the experience. We sat inside, and ordered the platter for two and the hummus app. The food is good considering there isnt much competition for Persian cuisine in Singapore. Meats were well seasoned, and the portions are generous, which I find true for most Persian restaurants. The lamb and chicken were definitely the highlights, but I would've liked to try a salad as well. I'd recommend you under order on the protein/platter (get a platter for 2 as a table of 3), so you can try another app or salad. Also, remember to ask for a small serving of garlic yogurt and chili padi sauce. They're delicious and help bring everything together. If you come for dinner, then you might also be welcomed by some lively music and belly dancing. I enjoy dinner entertainment, but if prefer privacy ask for a table inside -it's less audible. We ended up paying $189, which was the premise of the 3 stars, but I'd come back. The food is good, and I think you can fare better with a little menu hacking and a bigger group.",

I'm a sucker for lamb kubideh and have tried the best from LA to Istanbul. Shabestan can give any of them a run for their money. The service is quite attentive and personable and with a smile. I always demand something spicy whether it's chili flakes, chili padi, chopped jalape\u00f1o or grilled peppers. Not only did the host/manager give me and my fianc\u00e9 two big bowls of mouthwatering spicy sauce each, he also made sure I had plenty of green peppers on the side, grilled to perfection. I can't praise this place enough. The chicken kubideh was delightfully memorable too. Can't wait to go back even though we were there 30 mins ago.",

We often times start with the Halim Bademjan ($13), which is pureed eggplant with braised, tender lamb and green lentils, garnished with sun-dried yougurt and mint sauce. It's basically babaganoush and is a wonderful appetizer, but not Paleo if paired with their bread. They will bring you cut up veggies if you request, and it's delicious! The hummus ($10) is also a great option, but still a Paleo cheat.I've also had the Soup E Jow ($11), which features barley, herbs, vegetables and chicken. The North Dakota girl in me adores this comfort-food soup, but the Paleo angel on my shoulder disapproves! Our go to entree is the Shabestan Platter for Two ($95). It comes with minced lamb, chicken, fish, prawn, and a lamb or beef fillet. We always opt for the beef.In addition to the food, they have a belly dancer on Friday evenings, beginning around 8:00 pm. It's never too hard to get a table here, and we've had luck every time even when we haven't made reservations.",

Turns out, it was just their regular lunch menu.The deal includes soup of the day, a main course (from a limited list) and dessert, along with a soft drink.For the soup of the day, we got the Ash-Reshth and Soup-E-Jow. The former is vegetarian and had these Persian noodles stewing in a soup of cilantro, spinach and herbs. It was alright. I'm not sure how Persian noodles are supposed to be cooked like but it was a tad overcooked for me. The Soup-E-Jow was sort of a Persian take on chicken soup and it tasted great.We selected the Lamb Kubideh and Zereshk Polo with Chicken. The Zereshk dish was so-so. It seemed like the chicken curry my mum would make but my friend thought otherwise. However, the saffron rice with pomegranates and pistachios that accompanied the dish was amazing. It was wonderfully flavoured. The Lamb Kubideh won me over, hands down. It was juicy and just thinking about it right now has got me salivating!! It was just fresh and a definite must try! As for dessert, \u00a0we each got a scoop of Persian saffron ice cream with chopped pistachios. Ah...it was really good. Not too sweet and cleansed the palette very well.This place is a definite must try!",
