This location is nice and clean (unlike the ghetto China town in NYC...) lots of veggies, quality meat (Kurobuta is awesome), and noodle. Waitress will help you set up your meal, and you prepare your rest of meal...we have to pay and prepare own meal?! LoL. Food is definitely amazing. Location is right on top of Icon center and overlooking the traffic intersection, the view is awesome. Reservation is a must, and there's a time limit so be sure to pace yourself.",

    "text": "The restaurant was under the Imperial Treasure chain, and offered hotpot. It was considered one of the most atas outlet in Singapore to offer hotpot. There was also branch in Great World City. This outlet looked quite grand from the entrance. Reservation of 8 people was made a week ago. The staff called up about an hour before the reservation to confirm. The staff showed us to a private room with a great view of Orchard Road. The table was big with 2 induction stoves and could seat 10 pax comfortably. Most hotpot restaurant had sauce counter, but here the staff brought the tray of sauces which consisted of satay sauce, peanut sauce, sesame sauce, sesame seeds, chilli sauce, garlic chilli sauce, sliced green chilli, sliced red chilli, chopped coriander, deep fried chopped garlic, chopped garlic, chopped spring onion) to the table. Each person was charged $2.50++ for the sauces.For soup base, selected Imperial Drunken Chicken Soup \u4e7e\u9686\u9189\u96de\u7aa9 ($28++) which tasted slightly bitter in the beginning but was quite flavourful. It came with a bowl of marinated chicken to add into the soup. The chicken was quite tender.Accompanied with the following :King Tiger Prawn \u9cf3\u5c3e\u8766 ($18++/ 4pc) - served peeled, big and juicySliced Eel \u767d\u9c54\u7247 ($14++) - quite boneySquid \u9bae\u9b77\u9b5a ($10++)USA Sliced \"Kurobuta\" Pork Belly \u7f8e\u570b\u9ed1\u8c5a\u8c6c\u8169\u8089\u7247 ($14++)Sliced Lamb Shoulder \u9bae\u7f8a\u80a9\u7247 ($15++)Four Treasure Ball Platter \u9bae\u56db\u5bf6\u4e38 ($14++/ 8pc) - Fresh Prawn Ball, Fresh Cuttle Fish Ball, Fresh Canton Dace Fish Ball, Fresh Pork BallFresh Prawn Noodle \u5527\u5527\u9bae\u867e\u9eb5 ($14++) - The staff pipped out the paste from a bag, very tenderFresh Dace Fish Noodle \u5527\u5527\u9bea\u9b5a\u9eb5 ($11++) - The staff pipped out the paste from a bag, very tenderAssorted Vegetable \u96dc\u83dc\u7c43 ($6.80++)Bamboo Pith \u91ce\u5c71\u7af9\u7b19 ($20++) - spongy and softAssorted Mushrooms \u96dc\u83c7\u7c43 ($8.80++)Deep Fried Fish Skin \u9165\u70b8\u9b5a\u76ae ($6.80++)Deep Fried Beancurd Skin \u70b8\u4e09\u79d2 ($6.80++) - Everyone's favourite item, had it without soaking in the hotpot, so that it would be light and crispy. Else soaked for a few seconds in hotpot which soaked up the soup easily.Chilled Beancurd \u51cd\u8c46\u8150 ($4++) - It was like a more airy and softer version of the dried bean curd, which was able to soak up the soup.Washed down the meal with Cooling Herbal Tea \u6e05\u71b1\u51c9\u8336 ($12++/jar) and Sweeten Plum \u79d8\u5236\u9178\u6885\u6e6f ($12++/jar)",

    "text": "We are big fans of the ImpTreas group, and like ALL their different brands, no month goes by without us visiting one of their outlets. I must say I am not a big amateur of steamboats especially in the hot Singapore weather, so this was our first visit since the restaurant opened. \u00a0You can recognise the Imperial Treasure signature: understated and elegant d\u00e9cor, courteous and professional service. The food? It is high-end alright - lots of soup choices, high-quality ingredients, nice sauces - but it's over-the-top for a steamboat restaurant, which at the end of the day is still a family or close-friend affair. It's too pricey, a bit stiff, and after the meal you can still feel the MSG. At least, Haidilao is more fun. So, we'll stick to ImpTreas Teochew, Peking Duck and Shanghai, or the simple Noodles & Congee.",

    "text": "Ah, Imperial Treasure Steamboat.One of my favourite-est steamboat places in Singapore, the quality is excellent, the soups mouth-watering, the prices (can be) eye-watering. While reservations are generally recommended, you're sometimes able to sneak in without one, but I wouldn't gamble on it if you're already set on having dining here.There's no one item that blows me away, but rather just the sense of indulgence, the delicious food, and the soups that time and time again prove to be so much better than most other places.The price makes it hard to give five stars, but if you're the sort that's price insensitive when it comes to food (cough cough join the club) then this place will easily win your heart. And stomach. And hard earned cash.",

    "text": "I would give this a full 5stars based on food taste and experience alone, but will deduct 1 star just becoz it's pricey.The ingredients are really really REALLY fresh and I can't fault them for putting the prices they do, you do get what you pay for.The prawn balls, sotong balls, and all dumplings are handmade and you will definitely know the difference between other steamboat places the immediate instant you take a bite out of it!The soup bases are already very thick even before you pop any stuff into the steamboat. No msg or artificial flavouring taste can be found inside the soup. The porkbone soup is milky and flavourful, the mala is not oily like what u might find elsewhere! You can be sure I'll be back again soon! But this time, I won't order the set, just go alacarte and go straight for all the handmade meat/seafood balls and dumplings and some of those slices of pork and beef! That's where the money's at!I also loved the dip mix which the waitress helped us concocted! Damn you imperial treasure for setting steamboat standards so high, I might never enjoy steamboat anywhere else again! :(",
