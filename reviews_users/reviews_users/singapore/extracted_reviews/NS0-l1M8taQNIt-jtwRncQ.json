    "text": "One of the better dessert cafe in Singapore. Even though the cafe is located in a Neighbourhood area, it is flocking with lots of customer daily. Their dessert is amazing such that after you eat you would want to have another one. The atmosphere is great for relaxing or gathering with friends. However it is small and crowded most of the times. There are out door seating available too. But it gets hot outside. So I would recommend to go during off peak period. Must try their waffles as well as their cakes. Delicious. They do customer cake orders on their website. Really amazing cafe.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try out the rainbow cakes at The Bakery Chef for over a year now! And I finally got there! There's HDB parking at the nearby library, which is gantry operated.It is quite a small cafe, not a lot of seats, and they do not take reservations either. The cake display is so inviting! I had to order the $5.80 rainbow cake for sure and it did not disappoint! The bakery chef has started to sell waffles recently as well and I decided to try a non-conventional waffle with cotton candy!1. Rainbow cake $5.80The was moist, the layers were of even thickness and most of all! The butter cream on the top wasn't sweet. It was perfect. I loved it! I would totally get this again for sure! \u00a0I like that it is a petite size, so it's not too huge that you have to share it and also makes the price cheaper as well :D2. Berries Waffle $13.90The waffles came with cotton candy perched on a plastic stick that was \"planted\" into a cup of green tea powder on top of a cup of chocolate mousse. The waffles were very crispy and I loved it! They were generous with the fruits and I am won over by their crispy waffles.I also like that they have free wifi! The staff were friendly, but the shop is really cramped, and the tables are very close to each other. Nonetheless, if you are within the area, do check this out :D",

It's a pity that the electrical sockets were covered, so I had to proceed to the library nearby to work on my laptop.Oh! And for $10 you can get a Rainbow Cake, a Cuppa and a Macaron. Makes for a good tea, or a dessert after Lunch!",

It's quite small (around 15 persons inside and 6 outside) but it worth definitely a good place in my \"where to sit down with my computer\" quest.

Instagram-worthy cakes here, at wallet-friendly prices, with good coffee (as reviewed by a colleague). My favorite has to be the red velvet cheesecake, although chocolate lovers will revel in the chocolate cake selection.Please do come here and support them. I think they are a nice small, cosy establishment with really good cakes that are worth every dollar.",

My colleagues and I decided to try out this one after reading some reviews on Instagram. We were instantly greeted by the friendly staffs upon arrival; probably because we were the first ones there. Haha! The cafe was soon filled by the time we got our order.I tried 2 different cakes -- Rainbow Cake and Chocolate Guanaja... The rainbow cake, nuh uh! Not so much. At least I have tasted better. But the chocolate cake, muah!! Me likey! They had many more pretty looking cakes which I wish I could have tried given the time.My colleagues tried their Apple Caramel Pancake and both their feedbacks were the same, \"The apples are too overwhelming!\" So well, I still would like to try more of their stuffs though. Overall, quite an experience.",

    "text": "I've heard quite a lot about the Bakery Chef ever since I came back from Tokyo but I've never got the motivation to head to the main shop. So it must be luck and fate that I chanced upon its pop-up stall at Orchard Central. The signature rainbow cake dutifully lived up to its reputation and exemplified all the essential qualities of a good sponge; moist and fluffy. There is even a tinge of citrus embedded in the layers. However, the cream was frosted unevenly and in short supply compared to the previous photos of rainbow cakes churned out from the same kitchen. The Chocolate Rainbow \u00a0($5.50) turned out to be the better executed of the two as the ganache was velvety and the bottom sponge layers did not suffer from the ill fate of dehydration like the Rainbow Cake did. Most of the cakes assumed the same style and formula; squarish sponge cakes layered with cream. There isn't much excitement until I had the Matcha and Caramel Delight ($5.50 each), whose core is injected with red bean paste and salted caramel sauce respectively.Alas, something unpredicted amidst the predictabilities. In fact, both cakes surpassed the excellency of the predecessors with their unmistakable saturated sponge and little mounds of smoky piped cream. Nonetheless, these cakes were extremely delicate and I counted my blessings that little damage was inflicted by the heat when I transported them home. However, it was only until the Praline Delight ($6) when I started to see potential of this pastry shop. Chocolate mousse, hazelnut paste +crunch, sponge cake coated in chocolate ganache and nuts. It might not be the most original idea, but it's a classic combination done well. Simply look at how beautiful each layer has come together! This cake should deserve more credit and raving reviews than the mundane sponge cakes.",
