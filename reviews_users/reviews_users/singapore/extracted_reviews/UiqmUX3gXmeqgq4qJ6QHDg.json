OMG I am not a dessert girl but my dining partner told me that I would be missing out if I did not try, was she right! \u00a0All natural, no dairy and purely delicious. \u00a0Atmosphere is rustic but comfortable, small so have a reservation! \u00a0I'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "My friend and I shared two mains from Today's Specials: Mushroom-Feta Burger and Raw Crispy Lasagne. Both were priced for $22+, which was pretty expensive given the ingredient and portion of food. \u00a0The Mushroom-Feta Burger was delicious and filling. It came with a side of sweet potato fries and coleslaw. Normally, I'm not a fan of either of these sides because of their oily, mayonais-y aftertaste but Afterglow's healthy spin made me simply love them! \u00a0The main menu offers Raw Lasagne (priced for $20) but the waitress strongly suggested that we try the \"Today's special's: Raw Crispy Lasagne\", which has a extra layer of dehydrated tomato and \u00a0Macedonia cheese for the extra crunch. Though the dish was interesting and presented well, the flavor and texture didn't impress me as much as the mushroom-feta burger. Though I liked the substitution of thinly sliced zucchini instead of the actual pasta, it failed to accentuate the tomato sauce flavor. I also was expecting the dish to be warm but it turned out to be cold, and I think I prefer my lasagne warm :PIf I could, I would rate this place a 3.5 for it's delicious burger and ambiance! But sadly the lasagne was a disappointment and the place felt a bit too cozy. \u00a0Would I go back there again? I would, just because I would like to give this place another try with their other selections and desserts. Pro:-Romantic setting -Creative dishes-Healthy, raw choicesCons:-Too cozy with little privacy -Expensive-Hard to see the Today's Special's Menu from seating-No wifi",

The drinks we had heard weren't worth the price, since everything on the menu was kind of high, but the food was definitely worth it. I split the seasonal special Raw Masala Pizza and the Zucchini with 'Meat' balls and both were delicious- and gluten free!!! There were only three things on the menu that were not gluten free, two of which were burgers, because they made things with Tamari. A must try if you like vegan/raw food!",

The crew is passionate about their food and ingredients. Their motto in serving fresh sustainable dishes keeps their creativity flowing. They are always changing items on the menu. So far, my favourite is the nori achar roll. A local delicacy of pickled vegetable wrapped with sesame and seaweed. I really enjoy the wine selection as well. Brand new to the neighboorhood and already a big hit with the community. Another visit real soon for a more updated review. Keep up the great work guys!",

    "text": "Sometimes a girl just needs a little roughage. A little greenery and something natural as penance for all the booze and late nights. This is where Afterglow comes in, with vegan cuisine served in a chilled environment.I sampled the quinoa salad which was simple and tasty. I would have enjoyed some more variety with the vegetables (there was only lettuce and tomato) but it was healthy and a nice side dish to some shared vegan \"cheese\" with dehydrated vegetable and seed crackers.Ahuh. Vegan cheese. I guess if you squint and pretend that the only cheese you've ever eaten is cream cheese, then this MAY fool you in to thinking it's cheese. In all honestly it's nothing like cheese but it's bloody delicious and I'm pretty sure I ate more than half of my share of what was a shared dish. The crackers it came with were really good smeared with our \"cheese\" made from pinenuts. \u00a0This is an absolute must order if you dine here.On a later visit I sat for half an hour, stole the free wifi and drank a coconut water. At $4 for a tiny bottle it seemed very expensive but hey... it was organic and good for me, right?",

This was a good meal that you won't feel guilty about it afterwards.Slightly on the pricey side (chips with homemade nut cheese cost $19) but considering the quality of the food, quite understandable.",

The soups are warm but nothing is heated above 45 degrees C.The restaurant is dark, comfortably air conditioned, with very cool lounge music. Entrees are about 16, not cheap, but you will feel nourished and good about yourself. I treated myself to a blueberry cashew cream parfait. It was light and delicious. For $12 it won't be a regular indulgence but I appreciate the concept of clean eating.",

I enjoyed their cold-pressed juice (the green one with spinach in it), it was nice and light and very veggie, with a nice sweetness. The star of the meal was definitely the homemade kimchi nori rolls. These are sushi rice rolls packed with kimchi and chickpeas and god knows what vegetables, but they are irresistable. Super yummy, and tastes healthy at the same time. The soups were good, but nothing to shout about. The nut cheese was interesting, being a cheese made without any dairy, but I thought it was a tad overpriced. The avocado sashimi rice (forbidden rice, avocado, roasted edamame, other vegetables) was very tasty with a hint of sesame oil, but the portion was quite small. The quinoa rice was very bland, don't get it. Will be back for the nori rolls for sure! Good craft beer selection as well, and comfy, relaxed environment.",
