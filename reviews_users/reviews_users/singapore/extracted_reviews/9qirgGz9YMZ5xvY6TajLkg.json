I had some great breakfast here, carrot cake (2 flavor), dumplings, Indian food...and can't start a day without good kapi!With all the food I spent less than $20. Why would I go to breakfast at Hotel which charges $40!?",

So far like the bak chor mee (Soon Lee), the famous roast pork char siew stall (I always order extra veggie to moderate my guilt), the hokkien mee is pretty good (but I prefer the ABC Market one)..and the drink stall in the corner at the opposite end of the carpark entrance (Seletar something) has tea that is not overly sweet for 90cents!! (hot or cold)It's also near Rangoon Road if Liberty Coffee happens to be open on a Saturday for me ;)",

    "text": "5 star for the cheap and tasty food in this market!I may be biased since I only tried a few stall here but those few stalls were all good hence I'm convinced most food in this market will be good.If you are first time here, you HAVE TO try Sheng Sheng Hokkien Mee. They are one of the best I had so far. For $3 you will get a big plate of fragrant noodle coated with savoury gravy plus 2-3 prawns and squid. To me, it's the perfect consistency, not too wet neither it's too dry for my liking. Don't be defeated when you see a long queue. It's worth the wait.I was salivating when I saw my friend's plate of kuay chap from Double Spring Teochew Lor Duck Kway Chap. All the ingredients were braised well enough, soggy + brown and they were truely tasty! Things that I wish to try the next time I come:Wah Kee Big Prawn Noodle, Mee Jiang Kueh, Pek Kio Seafood delight, Tan Kee's roasted",

    "text": "What makes a hawker centre stand out?Interesting and well executed food that keep the masses coming back for more!i've sampled food from a variety of stalls and find the staples - nasi lemak, carrot cake, and a surprise one, cheong fun - to be delicious!The food:It's always about the long queues or famous stalls right? \u00a0Here the heavy hitters are a carrot cake (good spice I think) which has very hearty and eggy carrot cake though I wish they could add a pinch more salt. \u00a0The nasi lemak at the back though is full of flavor with a heavy dose of coconut milk and crunchy accompaniments of fried chicken, fish cake or braised cabbage. The famous \"hong kong style\" cheong fun stall is really unique and they make fresh cheong fun. \u00a0Liquid rice flour is poured onto metal steaming sheets for each order and a variety of toppings from fresh shrimp to scallops \u00a0are added. \u00a0Another person folds and cuts each order. I recommend the sweet shrimp, but any order is full of the lightest cheong fun around. \u00a0It is quite a wait, but definitely tasty!Next time you are around Farrer Park, check out one of my favorite hawker centers. \u00a0Get there for brunch and chow down on some tasty local food to start your day (that and some stalls close early!)",

    "text": "My favourite hawker center in Singapore, hands down. Yeah, Tiong Bahru, Maxwell, Old Airport Rd, Gluttons Bay, whatever, are more famous, but this gem holds a special place in my heart. I come here every week though I live quite far away. It's also the only hawker center I never fail to see someone (usually a couple of people) I know when I visit. Different people. So maybe it's not that unknown after all.Price wise, I think it's one of the hawker centers that have not had ridiculous inflation, you can still find eats for $2-$3. Don't forget it's located in a really central location, so this is rare. There's good spice carrot cake ($1.50, 2, 3 4), which I've grown up eating. There's also another carrot cake stall that's not bad, though it has been closed for a while. There's also the famous big prawn noodle, though I'm not so hot on that. A lor mee stall just opened, that's not bad, though portions have been shrinking rapidly. The chicken rice store is also extremely popular, but I think it's by virtue of being around super long, and growing into a habitual taste. It's only so-so. I dabao it home for dinner every week too. Good kuehs and pancakes to buy as well, but I forget which stall. I always ask for the corner piece :)Just try everything man. I usually spend 3h there, starting with meesiam (most would say it's so-so only, but I like its super lightness :P), lormee/fishball noodles, carrot cake, giam tao roti and whatever else I feel like eating that day. It's a super dynamic place. Some stalls come (watch out for even 1.50 promotions lol, happened a few times this year), some go, some branch out, the staples stay... not too many stalls that it's overwhelming. Love this place. Also, they have some bazaar with stalls selling random stuff every month. May be the first or last Sunday, I always forget.Last, this is a morning place, some things sell out around noon. At night, there isn't much accept those black/white noodles/lwayteow stalls.This place cannot be beat for price/location in Singapore. That I'm pretty certain. If you're bored of the hawker center, there are foodcourts a stone's throw away as well, but they are not as popular.",
