    "text": "gorgeous space, beautiful-looking food - but a complete disappointment in the tasting.the fabulous baker boy ain't so fabulous, really. it was disappointing in the most, but too mediocre to wreck/ rack my brains for any semblance of a rant.let's start with the good - the little compound it's housed in makes for a beautifully relaxing hangout: an open porch, the allure of a historic-type building standing lone in a patch of green overlooking the colorful buildings of clarke quay.but the dishes are pretty humdrum. my salad with pumpkin was a sparse mound of leaves topped with bland pumpkin (caramelization of any sort would have really helped here) and served with a vinaigrette that seemed right out a bottle (luckily I got it on the side); a shepherd's pie was full of potato and a barely-there layer of cheese, and you had to dig deep to get at the bit of gravied meat; while the eggs florentine came with a strange saute of minced spinach and garlic spread beneath (depriving you of any freshness that would come from the greens).the biggest let-down of the meal though, were the cakes. I expect a fairly high standard if you describe yourself as fabulous, and those expectations were certainly bumped out by the display of more than ten cakes. all tall, all colorful, and as easily orderable as they are pinterest-able.but the flavors? non-existing. the only thing you could taste was the dry sponge that seemed to make a showing in both our slices, a stale sort of crumbly butter cake. the icing was essentially colored-but-barely-flavored buttercreamwe took a mouthful each, and stopped after the first bite.so the meal is marked for me by our leftover slices of cake - which almost never happens. most slices of cake still turn out pretty much edible: it's just butter, sugar and sweet stuff, no? but these were so bad we couldn't ourselves to eat anymore - which is when we headed to the lovely drury lane for a brunch part two.I would steer clear. even their coffee choices are small and apparently tastes just as mediocre - so not even worth a suggestion for a sit-down for a cuppa. wholly disappointing - and I'm not sure I've had my brunch plans so thwarted in a long time.",

Red velvet cake - my friend love this, but personally I'm not a red velvet fanStrawberry shortcake - loved this. Definitely one of the better ones I've tried. Really like the strawberry jam used as filling Really wanna try the sticky date and lemon yoghurt one next time!",

    "text": "So I am a huge dessert fan and I really really wanted to love this place. I've posted this review in HungryGoSomewhere and didn't get a response from the owner. Now with Yelp in Singapore, I need to continue to share my experience.They have a great location - I had no clue where \"The Foothills\" even was? A friend told me that it was near Liang Court but across the street...where? The cafe is super cute. No boring mall location here. It's tucked away in a side of Fort Canning Park. Ample, comfortable seating. Cute decor - doesn't look Ikea to me. Oh and their cakes are super attractive looking. If you wanted a beautiful cake for a kids party, adult tea gig, heck, probably even a wedding, this is the place to come (notice that said pretty...which doesn't mean delicious or tasty). That's about where the compliments end.I had this cake a friend's birthday party and it was decorated like Cookie Monster. There was even a cookie hanging out of the side of Cookie Monster's face. Looked like a winner to me (remember, I said beautiful cake?). We cut it up and passed around sliced. The icing, I think, was a buttercream that tasted only of butter and maybe a teaspoon of sugar. The best way to describe it would be to imagine mixing a can of Crisco and four sticks of butter together. Now add two teaspoons of sugar. Drown in Smuft blue food coloring. That's the icing.On to the cake. The one we had was a salted caramel chocolate. Cake was tasteless and dry. I appreciated that it came in three layers with caramel in between, which that was nicely flavored. But the caramel wasn't enough to carry the weak, dry cake, along with lardy icing.Even after this bad experience that left everyone's teeth a bright blue, I wanted to give it another shot for a baby shower I was hosting. The cake's presentation was super attractive - I can't fault it for that. Really, it's an impressive looking cake.The following day, I went to the outlet on River Valley. I walked inside of the restaurant and there were three employees there: two friendly women and a shortish man who I can only assume is the \"fabulous baker\", owner, or boss during the shift. I asked if I could buy a cake and was told that I needed to order three days in advance. Cool, that's fine. But then I started asking questions about the cakes in the fridge and none of the three associates wanted to help me. What flavor are these? No response. How many flavors do you have? No response. I'm not sure why these associates froze up or acted awkwardly to my questions.I still wanted a cake. I asked if the cakes in the fridge were spoken for. Again, I got stares. Blinks. I pointedly asked the ladies and they told me to ask the shortish man. He said that they weren't but were to be served in the restaurant, as guests ordered them, sliced. Then I asked that, hypothetically, what if I wanted to buy the ten or twelve slices that would consist of a cake, could he serve them to me. He said that I needed to order cakes three days in advance. Broken record? I heard you the first time, shortish man. In the end, he caved and said that if someone were to come in and ask for ten slices, he would have to sell them to that person.So then I asked for ten or twelve slices of the cake in the fridge that weren't spoken for. The ladies stared at me again and kept blinking. I pressed the question again and they pointed to the shortish man. The shortish man just said he couldn't sell me the cake. I walked to the door and asked again if they were sure that they didn't want to sell me the slices and that I would tell my friends and blog about it; this was their last chance to remedy the bad experience I'd had. The shortish man said that no, he was not going to sell me the slices.All in all. Great looking cake that tasted sub-par. And horrible service. In Singapore, there are so many great bakeries now. PV Plain Vanilla serves a kick butt cupcake in Holland Village, OKB on Kampong Bahru has the best brownie I've probably had in my life, and then you even have Twelve Cupcakes that has recipes for the \"Asian palette\". Against these folks, it's going to be stiff competition for Fabulous Baker Boy.",

Food was pretty good, I had the chicken curry while my hubby had the eggs Benedict. Main complaint was that it took so long for the food to arrive. There was just one other table at the time but we waited over 10 minutes for a cup of coffee and 45 minutes for the eggs Benedict! As the place filled up, one table got served their food immediately since they where friends with the owner while the rest of us had to wait. Go when you are feeling leisurely and definitely not starved and on an empty stomach!",

    "text": "~Location wise~it can be a bit hard to get to if you didn't google it first. basically its at the foot of fort canning hill directly opposite liang court. (i.e. the opld river valley swimming complex) thanks to google i manage to figure it out~ambiance wise~ i would say its more like a tuck shop (i.e toa payoh swimming pool's tuckshop) there is a choice between indoors and outdoors. Even thou we choose indoors it was still rather humid/hot, and i was like sweating while i was indoors. Outdoor wise i would say even if they had fans they weren't as powerful to cool someone down. I was there around 2 - 4pm. ~Service wise~ its abit haphazard, in the sense that going there first they tell you to get a seat, then after they tell you to order at the counter. (most people would expect you to give them a menu if asked to take a seat?). Menu wise rather unprofessional, i mean having a menu printed out and pinned on a board shows the lack of professionalism. i would rather they have wrote it on a black board then printed on paper making it seems so not serious about their food.~Price wise~for the same price i think i rather go to TCC/coffee club or some restaurant \u00a0in liang court. It's probbly going to be a try once never go again (unless someone else is paying....) ~Table wise~ try to avoid the indoors the table is too narrow. My other qualms about the service, Water. basically each table was given water, but maybe cos they lack organisation or were really busy water came to us much later in the meal. (If i didn;t have my own bottle of water i probably would have choke, thou i must say its illogical that the water for 3 people came after the tea i ordered, what happened was a mix of chaos \u00a0and lack of a proper system) I witness some other table's order missing a sausage and stuff (food processing wise i would say they really lack organisation, i mean they asked if we wanted our cake with the food (again what kinda question is this??) and we opted to have it after the food, and they forgot about it, since they processed the first part and threw away the order chit, so when it came to our cakes we have to tell them and get the excuse that they forgot... *sighs*)~Food Wise~The only thing they had going for them was the food, i had egg Benedict, it was really tasty but proportion wise i would preferred if their cakes were a bit smaller. I would not recommend going for 2 course (I can really eat, but having both the egg Benedict and the carrot cake really made me skipped dinner)~Cake wise~ i had the chance to try 3 of them. their famous red velvet, their carrot cake and their lemon vanilla rasberry. i would say i found their carrot the best, some how the previous reviews had stated their red velvet was nice but i found both the red velvet and Lemon vanilla a tad too dry. \u00a0Overall i would say its a nice place to go in the evening for tea (after 5 perhaps?) but they fact that when they got busy it shows their lack of a system in place to deal with the orders and the amount of people reflects that there is a lack of organisation.this place needs a lot of improvements for it to succeed in the long run.",

For those who drive, you will have to park opposite at Liang Court mall & take the overhead bridge on the 2nd floor of Liang Court. It's about a 200m uncovered walk from the bridge to the cafe so it's a bit of a hassle especially when it rains. Staff are friendly.

Anyways, I was planning on having it for breakfast with my morning coffee. \u00a0I like to start my day off by looking at something pretty and there was a very pretty buttercream rose on top of my slice when I handed it to them to box it up. \u00a0In the morning...

Visited on a Saturday afternoon, the cafe was crowded. Thankfully there was an empty table that could sit 6 of us. They have a good selection of cakes available. We ordered the Earl Grey Cake, Lime pie and another cake which I can't quite recall the name. The earl grey cake color was super appealing, somewhat a shade of purple but not quite. It's really pretty. An unconventional taste that isn't too sweet. Would recommend this - not that it's super tasty but more so for its unique taste. The lime pie was really good! You could tell the love for this pie by the speed it disappeared from the plate. Just perhaps a tad too sweet for my taste bud, still a absolutely must have.can't recall the last cake we had, it's good too. Given its name, the cakes meets our expectation. A great place to hang with friends and hide from the blazing heat. Limited parking at the park.

    "text": "First, I gotta start by apologizing to the Chef and Owner, Ju! I love you, Sweets and I'm sorry it took me so long to finally come and sit down for a proper dinner. Beyond all the great reviews that everyone has been ranting about, I really enjoy the atmosphere and warm hospitality by everyone. The food served are rich and supple, servings are very generous, just as Ju says \"My servings are very generous, just like me!\" ;)I had the Ju's Prawn Pappardelle, while my friends has the Spiced Beef Burger and the Prawn Burger. The Burgers were served with Garlic fries, a great complement to lift the tastes of the burgers further. I cant comment on the burgers cos I havent tasted them, but for someone who doesnt usually have creamy pasta, the Prawn pappardelle was awesome. Rich but not overpowering, Ju managed to ensure that the pasta was still kept Al Dente even when it's soaked in the creamy prawn sauce.For desserts, we had the Blueberry Lemon Cake and the Lemon Meringue Pie. The cakes here are big. The textures feel more like pound cakes rather than sponge cakes cos every mouth of cake is full and supple. Love the blueberry jam in between the layers of lemon cake as they complement each other perfectly with the sweetness of the blueberry jam and light lemon flavour. The lemon meringue pie had a really good balance of the sour lemon curd and the light meringue. The tart was buttery and give a good bite to the creamy tart.With all the good food, the only downer is the size of the table. I wished they were slightly bigger to contain all the awesome-ness on the table. :PFor those who of you who has yet to try, head down soon! For those who love this place, good news is, they are going to undergo a little reno in Feb 14 and reopen with a even more hearty menu. Cant Wait!",

    "text": "\"If it aint broke, don't fix it. Don't reinvent the wheel.\" Those were the thoughts that ran through my head as i sat through the preview of The Fabulous Baker Boy's new dinner menu. If only Juwanda were to stick to his brunch fare and cakes, I'm pretty sure people would love to have that for dinner as well.Let's start with my favorite part of the meal- the cakes. TFBB is known for their cakes and while there were hits and misses (Green Tea Praline was too dry, Red Velvet a tad sweet), the latest addition, the Pam D'OR stole the limelight. This cake was created in honor of Juwanda's muse, actress Pamela Oei, a dear friend of his. What's better than sticky date pudding? A sticky date cake sandwiched with layers of butterscotch and cream cheese. Oh brown sugar, latte butter cream, and Valrhona chocolate. This cake wouldn't always be available in store but i think it should be made a staple. A 3kg 9\" cake will set you back by $105 and each slice is $10. Love this one!Back to the dinner menu, skip the salads and starters as they are quite blah. The Almond Encrusted Salmon with a mango hollandaise ($22) had several decent elements, such as the fragrant fat-free mango hollandaise sauce that had just a hint of sweetness. The salmon was a little overcooked but still palatable and would certainly do well with more sauce. The contrasting textures could be enhanced with a creamier spinach rather than one that looked like it came through the cold pressed machine but the flavor of the veg was on point.I thought the Duck Confit ($21) was regular and by regular i do mean that it's not too bad. One of the more flavorful dishes of the night and the plus points were that it was fork tender and not too dry. I liked the cranberry plum compote that accompanied the duck.Steak Frites ($25) 230g NZ grass fed sirloin, grilled on the griddle, dressed with mushrooms and caramelised onions and the horrible fries. No comments on this one as it was forgettable. The fries were just horrid i can't even begin to describe them (gosh the oil).Serious room for improvement in the Fish Burger ($14.50). The components that i liked about this dish don't maketh a burger- the tangy Siracha tartar sauce, hint of curry leaves in the batter and the buttery billowing brioche. The batter needs to be WAAAY thinner and the fish needs more flavor on its own. Comes with the same horrible fries. The bastardized Fried Chicken &amp; Waffles ($21) which was served with a half chicken. The horrors!!! Always chicken fillet. ONLY chicken fillet. I didn't like this dish due to the super hard and dense waffle and the overdose of syrup on this one (it was already drenched when served). TFBB definitely needs to work this one out man. That said, the meat was sufficiently moist though the buttermilk flavor could be enhanced.Well well, that's my honest take on TFBB's dinner menu. Honestly i'm pretty certain customers would be happy with an all day brunch menu here with some heartier options. I do hope they work things the kinks out for dinner. In the meantime, be glad that you can now enjoy a slice (or two) with the extended opening hours at TFBB!",

Food was served piping hot, which means the dishes arrive singly. My oldest son had the Croque Monsieur, which was beautifully played and delicious. My youngest son had a BBQ beef grilled cheese, which he said he would definitely order again. I had the tuna melt, which was divine, but I only ate half of it to save room for dessert--which you must do! Amazing cakes... The attached picture doesn't include the refrigerated offerings! We'll definitely be back!",

Its my own fault and i probably had a mini seizure while ordering. \u00a0I saw the tuna melt at the table next to us and it looked GOOD. \u00a0I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The owner seemed really nice and friendly. \u00a0The service was good. The coffee was very good. \u00a0The location as nice but a little hidden. I honestly had never noticed it before. \u00a0I really like places that have an interesting menu. \u00a0The items seem fun. \u00a0I enjoyed it but felt like I had been nominated for an award but didnt actually win it. \u00a0I think I need to go back for dinner. The chili crab mac and cheese and the tuna melt are something I'm super curious to try. \u00a0I will need to try it again.",

    "text": "I can tell I'm going to love this spot.First, it sits on some historical real estate - boss Juwanda says the building used to be the cafeteria of sorts for the old River Valley swimming pool (how fitting!), that has since been filled up and is now his front lawn. Better yet, his kitchen occupies the former men's changing room! Boss promises only fully clothed occupants now though.Yes, the shop's called The Fabulous Baker Boy, but he does so much more. There's a \u00a0healthy menu that is being re-jigged to include some pretty yum Big Boy Tacos, which he did make for me and the Girlfriend today as an early preview treat! Look out for the guacomole - it's got a little something extra in it that makes it even more yum.Also, look out for the prawn fettucine - I've heard rave/ravenous/raving oh never mind. I've heard great things about it, and it's set to be offered for both lunch and dinner services very soon.Then we come to the cakes. Why hello there, my pretty... okay enough with the creepy tapping fingers, but the scheming minds are very much needed here, because you'll need to plan wisely to maximise how much cake you can get in your belly. There are just SO MANY OPTIONS. Always ask for suggestions - that way I found out that the Nutty Monkey (banana cake in peanut butter frosting and coconut flakes in between) had just come back on to the list! On suggestion, we'd also picked up a slice of lemon and raspberry cake, which was a great choice to help cut through the \"jelat\"-ness/heaviness of the Nutty Monkey.They've got a variety of bevs for you to sit tai-tai style and watch the world go by - coffee, a homemade iced tea, and beer and wine too, if you'd like.Also try: everything else. But maybe on your next visit. Or maybe you'll be greedy enough to take some home with you.Oh yes, and free (but small) car park too! Rejoice!",

    "text": "this is one of the rare finds in singapore. you are immediately greeted upon arrival at TFBB with a warm smile and a quick check of the reservations list (note: do reserve on weekends. they are obviously fab). I was seated in a comfy corner and menu and order list are all there. the menu... simple and easy to understand. well designed and obviously fab. i wanted to approach the counter to order but was immediately attended to promptly and my bff's crispy requirement to her pancakes addressed. i was escorted to the cake/pies/desserts from heaven section (maybe I have that i-need-dessert-now face). all the specials were introduced in detail and I felt at home. like how you will introduce your prized collection to your guest.our orders of extra crispy pancakes and croque monsieur was well done and served properly. granted they kinda forgot my extra cup of latte ordered but overall they were attentive to detail. me and my friend left the table to decide on the cakes we wanted and when we returned to the table, voila! our water was refilled and my friend's tea was topped up with more hot water! this was without us asking! i am impressed!While they have a policy on weekends that the turnover per table is 1.5 hours from reservation, we were not rushed out of TFBB. However, I can see why they need the tables. everyone wants a taste and feel of home on a saturday!the dessert was well done. i had the blueberry yoghurt cake while my friend had the raspberry cake. very well done and not too sweet. goes well with a cup of coffee. one gripe is that their latte art needs a bit more work (not consistent and a little sloppy).Overall, this is not just another restaurant checked off the list. a very impressive service staff that makes you keep coming back because you feel welcomed and at home. of course the dessert junkie in me is prepping for the next visit to try ALL their cakes. TFBB, you live up to your name. continue to always serve fabulous food in a fabulous fashion. you have won me over with ur extensive range of cakes and sweets but most importantly, your hospitality. thank you for starting my saturday right.",
