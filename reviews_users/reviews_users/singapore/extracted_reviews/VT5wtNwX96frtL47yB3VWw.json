Ordered the grilled buri with a side of tororo soba. Alas taste was so average borderline bad save for the handmade soba that was chewy and had a nice nutty flavor. The tororo had a tiny tinge of sour like it had been grated ahead and left out for a while. The grilled buri was quite bland and not much fat thus overal taste was flat.Service was also quite poor. Took a while for anyone to come take my order.",

Pricing is all over the place, some items are good value (nebaneba, karaage) while others are quite overpriced (belly pork and steak set) The chawanmushi used to come in a bowl last year but now comes in a tiny cup smaller than most of the tea cups in Chinese restaurants. I was wondering why this place was barely full on a Saturday at 6.30pm. Now I know. Not sure if I'll be back.",

    "text": "Went dinner with ex colleagues at this outlet. Went to the Changi City Point outlet once previously and their meals are really delicious. Therefore I have quite a expectation for this outlet too. Their service was good. No problem with their service. Moving on to the food. I was attracted to get the Beef Steak Set because I tried once before at their CCP outlet and it was great. But I chose to have the Mini Oyako & Cold Soba Set in the end because I would like to have the Cold Soba. The chawanmushi and prickles are included for my set. We ordered the Tori Salad to share. Looking wonderful it is, the taste is wonderful too. My friends and I love this salad. My friend each ordered a Torikurozu and Chirashi Don. The Torikurozu meat is really tasty. Another choice for me to choose for next time. The Chirashi Don was one of my choice in the start too because it look so colorful. HAHAHA! The portion of this Chirashi Don is quite small and all of us agreed on this too. My set was too filling for me though. So overall, the Torikurozu was good but not as awesome as the CCP outlet. The Chirashi Don was okay. My Mini Oyako & Cold Soba was okay too. The Cold Soba was nothing much and the Oyako was better taste than the Soba. Total bill cost $90+ for 3 person. I would still visit again next time.",

I would say the cooking is something out of a frazzled Japanese mom's kitchen, and not something sophisticated. It has a comforting home feel, but it's not for me.Service was good (when I could get it), and I wish they'd stop overworking their waitstaff. I don't think I'd be back.",

    "text": "Ootoya is a good choice if you're hankering for hearty Japanese bento meals. Tried the Tori Salad and Torikuzoru sets. Both sets included rice, miso soup and pickles. The Tori Salad has lots of vege, tender smoky juicy char grilled chicken and hard boiled egg. The Torikuzoru is similar to sweet sour chicken. Deep fried chicken pieces coated with sweet & sour sauce. Note that the sauces for the mains were rather salty. The rice in the sets can be changed to brown rice, or white rice with hijiki, or with tororo, or with sardines, for a price. The rice consistency varied at times. Twice they were perfectly cooked, once it was too soft. The rice with hijiki was nice with lots of seaweed shreds and tasted of plum as well.Most items in its menu are cooked items, and if one wants raw fish slices, there's maguro.Reservations are recommended.The green tea is non-complimentary, though the wet towels are.",

    "text": "In Japan, the menu indicates calories which can be useful for the health conscious but boo-boo for those who prefer to escape from reality and enjoy the food. For some reason, the menu here does not indicate any. It might take some people a lot of courage to try this \u00a0\u3070\u304f\u3060\u3093\u5c0f\u9262 (Bakudan Kobachi)-$7 simply because not everyone is fond of sticky stuff, and this particular appetizer is the ultimate conconction of the nightmarish ingredients-raw egg, natto, grated yam, lady fingers, raw meguro(tuna). But to me, spotting this on the menu was like rekindle old lover's flame with my natto.No complicated rules go into enjoying this. Simply whizz everything with splashes of shoyu and enjoy each morsel of sticky mess. \u00a0Not sure if there is any link but\u7206\u5f3e-a bomb, is also pronounced as bakudan! So this is really a BOMB!The ebi katsu set ($19/$14.50 ala carte) served with choice of white/multi-grain rice is also very tasty and now I know why it is a perennial favourite of my friend. Each deep-fried breaded piece had a crisp, fine golden coating that combines beautifully with the bouncy shrimp inside.  Tori Sauce Don with Kimuchi $14.50However, the chicken version was slightly greasy and blubbery, perhaps because the chicken skin was not fully removed. But as long as the sweet smoky tonkatsu sauce is there, it is difficult to resist another bite.Tori Ankake ($14 ala carte/ $17 set) tasted like a mui fan (rice with gravy). Sumiyaki Chicken Don $11.50As for the desserts, we nearly ordered everything as there was a 1-for-1 happy hour promotion during weekdays. The egg pudding was firm but had a winning caramel sauce that lingered long in the memory. My favourite was Soymilk Blancmange parfait $6: slightly firmed tau hway (soymilk pudding), whipped cream, red bean, banana and green tea ice cream. This is definitely not as grand as the towering parfaits but exudes a simple allure with soy beans.Kokutou (Dark Brown Sugar) Parfait $7--a layer of coffee ice cream and creamy brown sugar mousse sandwiched with egg castella sponge cake. \u00a0Banana lovers will like the parfaits here because all the variations here use banana...... plus raspberry (albeit frozen ones) Nice family ambience with budget Japanese food. However, the place looks understaffed even on a weekday night.",

I enjoyed it better going to the restaurant at the non-peak hours so you often have Japanese dining in. This place service Japanese cuisine but notably ones that are more home-styled, as opposed to the ones we are more familiar with.I really liked their grilled chicken salad as the meat is seared to a golden brown with the essentially charred edges in teriyaki sauce which goes nicely with the refreshing salad. Another popular favourite is their set with seaweed rice and scallops. Their katsu is also something you will well enjoy. For the adventurous, you might want to try their grated yam, natto and okra side dish. It is a really healthy dish, if that helps with the convincing.",

That was until I got there and realized that the decor wasn't the only authentic thing there, but the food as well! There's a large communal area in the front of the restaurant that you can dine on, traditional style. The menu is simple and easy to gather, though the variety on offer is quite limited. The staff are attentive though waiting times can be a tad too long, which I reckon are due to the Japanese chef's high quality controls for the food before they get sent out to diners. That for me is a plus and I was also heartened to see plenty of Japanese expats dining there as well, which confirms the authenticity of the food served.",

The menu even lists a calorie count for each dish, which makes it great for the weight conscious. Be warned though - Ootoya is notorious for its long queues. Be prepared to wait up to 30 minutes on a crowded weekend dinner period. That being said though, the food is definitely worth it. I usually order the katsudon and it's among one of the better versions of the dishes that I've tried in Singapore. Service can be spotty - though I understand it is hard to provide excellent attentive service when a restaurant is super crowded. But hey, the food more than makes up for that",
