    "text": "standards have fallen since I came a while back - but it's still good enough eating to still make a visit.nam nam is part of the lauded les amis group, which is known for consistently decent food (as with aoki and their flagship restaurant), and that shows in the cooking: the humble pho retains its easy-going nature here, with not-obviously-MSGed broths cradling silky noodles and tender beef.I particularly like their bouncy meatballs, which have a good mix of proper meat and gristle - just enough of the latter for a little interest and texture.their not-noodle menu sections extend to banh mi (which seem popular at lunch, but which I've never tried), and delicious appetisers/ sides like a fishcake-topped salad of crunchy pickled vegetables (very delicious and moreish), expertly crispy fried chicken wings topped with a sweet-sticky glaze of onions caramelized in fish sauce, and spring rolls abound with crunchy skins and sufficient filling.the portions are adequate, but by no means large - so feel plenty free to load up on these (as well as bowls of extra meatballs, please).portions are noticeably smaller, and the food seems saltier/ more reliant on MSG than before (though it's more due to a suspicious sweetness of the food rather than that telltale thirst). it's still not at a point where it's too offensive to eat, and this place still certainly retains good value (especially in town) - just that you'll probably want more than just a bowl of noodles when you're here.",

    "text": "Consider this as the fast food chain of pho. Expect crowds during lunch as they have lunch sets for quick orders and plenty of seating at the Suntec outlet. I like the banh mi for takeout as it's a different taste to Subway. Love the tangy vegetables they add and the toasted crispy French style baguette. If you want authentic Vietnamese food, it's best to visit Joo Chiat where there a home style cooking restaurants helmed by Vietnamese cooks.",

    "text": "This is the first vietnamese place I've seen in Singapore... one that actually made me curious. I ordered the Wagyu pho with a side of bean sprouts (which you have to pay extra for... odd for me especially since in California it comes free). I think I made the mistake of getting the Wagyu.. it made the broth super greasy. The girl in front of me ordered just the steak and her broth looked semi oil but mine was outta control. The \"chili sauce\" which is supposed to be something like Sriracha was not very hot... it was kinda sweet actually. I'm used to the BIG bowls of Pho in California (maybe that's why americans are so big) but this place was meh... I honestly don't think 17 singapore dollars is worth it. In cali we get big yummy bowls of Pho for less than 8 bucks.... and you get all the fixings for free... so I don't think I'll be doing Pho in Singapore again.",

Not sure if it is this particular outlet in suntec that is not up to par, or just generally the entire chain.Pho was disappointing and just simply not good. Tastes were off and not worth the price point. Won't be back.",

    "text": "I'm not a pho connoiseur, but i've had pho in the states made by vietnamese immigrants and pho on the side of the street in saigon, and i'd say nam nam is alright! It's definitely not as bad as some of the reviews (in the other location) made it out to be though if i see a snaking queue out of the place i wouldn't bother.I almost always go for the beef steak slice pho. Sometimes i get the beef balls, but always pho. I'm ashamed to admit even though i've been here 5-6 times i haven't tried anything else on the menu... I guess nam nam is so synonymous to pho to me that everytime i think to go there, i was always craving pho and don't want anything else.Their guong cuo is pretty good too. I have it if i go for a lunch here bc it's included as part of the lunch set. I'm a huuuuge fan of vietnamese spring roll bc i love the texture of rice paper so i'm not really hard to please in this department. As long as they dont mess up the rice paper, all is good in my book. The peanut sauce they give to dip your guong cuo in ain't half bad either.Their price is good - you won't spend more than $15 unless you got a bunch of sides, but if noodles is your only thing then you won't even spend $10.",

    "text": "Nam Nam Noodle Bar is my go-to place for a quick fix if I have a craving for Vietnamese Beef Pho.My usual haunt would be the outlet at Raffles City which always has long queues come rain or shine. However, since other outlets have opened up, namely Wheelock Place and Suntec City, I have been patronizing the outlet at Suntec City quite a fair bit (i.e. less crowds!).This time, my group of two friends and I decided to try their Lunch Set @ $9.90 (excl. GST) consisting either1. Beef Steak slices Pho + Salad + either coffee or tea OR2. Chicken Pho + Salad + either coffee or teaVerdict:- Beef Steak slices Pho - The soup had all the usual goodness of beef flavourings but it lacked the punch and oomph that I was used to. The beef slices was a tad too stiff for me; not that it was over-cooked but I've tasted better on other occasions at this outlet.- Salad - Refreshing and had a tangy sour taste reminiscent of the Peranankan 'ah char'. The small side dish consisted fish cake, pickled cabbage, carrots and a sprinkle of nuts and chili flakes.- Iced coffee with milk - I found it bland and bitter for my taste. Totally unlike the famed Vietnamese coffee that I had in Ho Chi Minh City.Tip: The place gets pretty crowded from 12.15pm onwards with the office lunch crowd. Do stop by at 12pm sharp to get pretty good seats and enjoy 15 minutes of quiet lunch before the crowd sets in. Otherwise, it might be hard to get a conversation going among your lunch group.",

Soup taste good especially if it's really without MSGAs they claim. So far, one of the best Pho I have tried in Singapore.",
