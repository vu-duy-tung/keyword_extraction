But the food and the service too was outstanding, as my food arrived before I finished my first slice of bread. Oh and I had my first ever banana chocolate milkshake. Very pleased I came here, probably will visit one more time before I head back to Boston.",

The wings looked nothing like the menu and seemed like it was deep fried in old oil. I felt a bit sick to eat it. Ribeye was ok , my lady thought it was very disappointing and actually they brought out a medium rather than a medium rare. Staff seems a bit green. The table smells like it was wiped down with a rag that was soaking in old milk overnight.Actually we came here because of the 30 percent off special they had running but seriously not worth it with the discount.",

    "text": "Conviently located in Orchard Gateway is outback steakhouse. We arrived at 9pm on a weekday and the dining room was pretty much empty. The staff were still very cheerful and friendly.Based on their menu, it seems to have pretty much the same stuff you would find at any Outback in other countries.Outback Steakhouse is a steakhouse concept with more than 1,000 locations spanning 22 countries. Established in Tampa, Florida in 1988, each restaurant is a friendly, casual and relaxing place embodying the spirit of the Australian Outback with bold flavorful food.Outback takes great pride in serving the freshest, highest-quality food. I remember having some good memories with their grilled seafood, steak and blooming onions!The dining area is mainly made up of booths.1. Typhoon Bloom $14.90++For an appetizer, you cannot go wrong with the Typhoon Bloom for all onion ring lovers. It is no blooming onion, and to be honest. It looks like alot less effort went into this compared to a blooming onion. It is a hand-cut, fresh onion, dusted with Outback's own secret seasonings, stacked high and cooked until golden. The sauce provided in the center is their spicy signature bloom sauce. It's kind of tangy and I liked the creaminess of the sauce. I felt like the onion was fried abit too much and hence it was slightly on the dry side but other than that. It met my expectation of massive fried onion!2. Sirlion and Baby Back Ribs $39.90++This is a 6oz. siganture USDA sirloin paire with half a rack of smoked baby back ribs served with aussie thick cut fries. It is an okay portion for just one pax. But the juiciness of the steak justifies the pricing.medium steakThs ribs were also tender and though it didn't quite fall of the bones. It was tender enough for me to consider whether or not it was completely fresh, or fresh-frozen. Either ways, for $40++ you are getting a decent dinner.3. Toowomba Chicken $24.90++Sauteed shrimp and buttom mushrooms, tossed in a tomato cream sauce and served over grilled chicken. The shrimp and the mushrooms were delicious. I wish I could've asked a top up of a side of shrimp for this! The vegetables were steamed and had the right texture. I felt that the chicken was on the dry side and I didn't quite enjoy it. The tomato cream sauce, helped make the dry chicken slightly more bearable.",

We made a complaint to have the steak changed and the replacement dish we got was a raw ribeye.to make matters worse, my porterhouse had a taste of lamb in which I was allergic to and made me feel nauseated.The floor staff were excellent, but the kitchen is a total nightmare. I don't think the cooks (calling them chefs would be an insult to the profession) know what they were doing at all. it was a mother's day ruined.",

But, wow. \u00a0This place is in a very expensive \"looking\" area, but is just awful. I mean seriously. I had fun trying to swap the flies and bugs trying to steal some of my wine, the appetizer had no taste, the food was tremendously undercooked, and on sending back they did cook it more, I was greeted with a hot mess returned. I am actually laughing to myself at how bad this is. \u00a0I guess it must be all about the presentation. At least the wine was in a bottle so they could not try to add \"value there\"?Just wow.",

They offered really good service, complementary bread just like tony Roma's. But their food and great is great too! As compared to tony Roma's baby ribs, Outback Steakhouse wasn't as nice but their other dishes are just as good! The fillet steak is really juicy and tasted really good amazing. Worth the price as its huge in portion.",

    "text": "I had good memories of this chain from the 90s, but was unsure if my memory was reliable (or if my palette had been as sophisticated almost 2 decades ago).However, everything here was great, except the fresh fruit chiller.The complimentary bread and butter was quite unusual - it's the first time I've gotten black bread at a casual American restaurant (yes, Outback isn't really Australian!) The black bread was quite light and not bitter though, so I suspect it was just food colouring. The butter was quite light-tasting - almost closer to clotted cream than butter, but not everyone might like this.The Baked Potato Soup was quite flavourful, though it was a little thin and I would have preferred a bit more potato inside. The cheese and bacon on top was also quite measly.The Chicken Fried Chicken was good, despite the strange and repetitive name. It very well brined so despite being chicken breast it was very moist and tender. It could have been a bit crispier though. The white sauce on top was alright. It was served with mashed potatoes which were tasty and coarsely mashed with skin, giving them character.The Mushroom Swiss Burger (not sure about the name, but there was mushroom) had a well-grilled, hearty flavour rare in a Singaporean burger. Online reviews have people complaining Outback's burger doneness is always off, but my companion asked for medium and got medium (though the waiter forgot to ask at first, coming back just a minute later to enquire). The fries were flavourful, unlike most fries in Singapore, and crispy too.Oh yeah, the fresh fruit chiller. The only thing I could taste in my supposedly mango smoothie was sugar (and it wasn't even that sweet).I came for lunch on a weekday, so the prices were really good. If you come at other times you'll be paying a bit more.",

Sunday January 10th visit. Reason for visiting one of our favourites was for My birthday. We approached the guest services desk at 7:15 pm that Sunday night. The dining room was empty and we asked for a table for 2. We were shown to an area just inside the door. All the dinner guests at that time had been herded and coralled into this small area of booths. We asked for another option and were shown another booth in the same exact area. We have had this happen here twice before with deficient service. Obviously there is a staffing crisis here. No offer was made to seat us at the bar. We chose the best option by walking our dollars out the front door. This story has a happy ending as we found another dining outpost with sufficient staffing and. Had a wonderful birthday dinner. Guess we can cross Outback Orchard Gateway off our list. No equals next.",

This isn't Wooloomooloo, but at these price points, it's the cheaper, better Morganfield's.We had:1) Baby Back Ribs & Alice Springs Chicken Combo ($34.90): half a rack of juicy, fork-tender ribs burnished with a tangy bbq sauce that was finger-licking good, and petite chicken breast layered with sauteed mushrooms, crisped bacon and smothered in melted monterey jack and cheddar was flame-grilled to a moist perfection. This was sided by hearty handmashed potatoes, skins and all. \u00a02) Seafood Mix Grill ($29.90): a massive platter of smoky grilled mahi fillet (watch out for bones), seared shrimp and scallops, set atop a piquant mango salsa, and paired with buttered steamed vegetables, and a somewhat middling corn on the cob. Of note was the fat succulent scallops, which were done perfectly",

The manager conveniently asked me to place the steak onto the side plate where I had the bread. Minutes later, they brought the steak back and it was still rare. Again the steak was send back to the kitchen. This time, it came and was cooked medium rare. Not to mention the pork loin we ordered, was super tough to chew.",
