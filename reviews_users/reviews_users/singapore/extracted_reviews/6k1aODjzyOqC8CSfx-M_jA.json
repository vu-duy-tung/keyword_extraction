    "text": "the second pit stop of my affordable french food series lands on Poulet! The French Onion Soup ($5.80) might not be the cuppa soup for everyone as they replaced the melty cheese with cheese croutons. Personally, I am a traditionalist who would prefer the version from Taratata Bistrot.  I have to admit that I was drawn towards the Iberico Pork Belly with French Mustard that day. Even though it did not received much praises.Tiramisu \u00a0: a more intense alcoholic booze will be ideal.Tadaa....the golden apple tart with sweet almond fragipane topped with a large ball of vanilla ice cream. The version here is unique for its buttery crumbly base which I have not yet find in other places. Do not miss this if you love apple desserts.Poulet's \u00a0ambience is more relaxed and you won't feel rushed to finish your food. Good news is that they have opened a 2nd outlet in Great World City with some new items. And I can't wait to visit that place for their escargots and other french delights!",

When you serve food as salty as Poulet's, I think complimentary iced water is in order.Chicken in mushroom sauce - supermarket roast chicken in a cream sauce with some button mushrooms floating around. Lamb shank - tender but not tasty. Truffle mash - potato puree with butter and some truffle oil; can't really go wrong.To their credit, service was really speedy. But given we were the few patrons around... It wasn't difficult.Would I come back? No.P.S. They don't take Amex.",

    "text": "For the record I was really taken aback when I heard they don't serve water at Poulet. Do you wash your dishes in Evian too? It's pathetic. Then I was brought up to speed that it's become quite common not to serve water. Well then all those places are pathetic too. It's just water. Seriously. For the record you can get warm water for a 50 cent service charge. Well why don't you charge 50 cents and scoop some ice? It's truly arbitrary. But enough of my water rant and now onto the food which is truly a mix bag. I'll start with the stars of the meal. For pure food porn theatrics, order the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms with the poached egg. The runny yoke provides a luxurious coating over the earthy, well-seasoned mushrooms - my favorite bites of the meal. The signature roast chicken with the spinach and mushroom chardonnay sauce flirted with being too rich which is perhaps what makes it satisfying. The brined chicken is flavorful and the sauce paired well with it. Notable sides include the hachis parmentier and truffled mashed potatoes. The former is like a French shepard's pie and the latter has cream, butter, and truffle oil - pretty hard to mess up. Decent but unmemorable dishes include the French onion soup and the chicken salad. The way the salad is described on the menu would lead one to think it's a chopped salad with chicken when it really is a chicken salad sandwich sans bread served finger-food style on a lettuce leaf - it shouldn't have been lumped together with the other salads in the first place.There were notable disappointments too. I really wanted to try the oxtail bourguignon the moment I saw a picture of it outside the restaurant. The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender and you can taste the rendered red wine in the sauce but it desperately needed salt for the life of it to bring out flavor in an otherwise one-dimensional dish. Poulet's take on Chicken a l'Orange took a weird turn with the sauce. Perhaps they zested too close to the rhine of the orange because there was a distinct bitterness in the sauce that just fought so hard against the chicken. With the exception of the server refilling our warm water, service was apathetic but sufficient. It's all hit-and-miss here but Poulet can be a place to enjoy an affordable faux-French bistro experience if you make the right decisions when ordering.",

    "text": "When a restaurant does not serve water it's a major drawback for me and I would definitely not come back to that place at all. In Singapore, you can drink water from tap by simply using a water filter. So unfortunately, Poulet charges you .50c for a glass (and by glass I mean small kid's glass) of.. take note, warm water.. yup, they don't even serve cold or iced water and you have to buy a botlle of water. I don't drink anything artificial like soda or juice so I would only drink water whenever I dine out. I do refuse to buy 3.80 bottle of water thou. Its such a rip off! Second, their meal is reasonably priced, around $15.80 for mains but side dishes are not included which you have to pay for additional $4,80 for fries or similar side dishes.There is nothing spectacular about their food. You can honestly go to cold storage and buy a whole roast chicken for $6 and it would taste the same if not better.So you are not missing anything if you don't dine here. Probably best if you skip it!",

The place is lovely though - open concept dining and attentive staff who never let your water glass deplete to more than half full.A survey of the restaurant showed almost every table had the bestseller of Poulet Roti, beautifully plated and sitting in a shallow bath of mushroom sauce. Not exactly tempted, I went for the French Onion soup and lamb shank instead. The French Onion is one of the better ones I've had so far, though it sadly lacks the Emmental cheese that defines a classic onion soup. Still, I was duly impressed by the soup's depth of flavour and tender strips of onion, contrasted with crunchy squares of cheese toast. The lamb shank, also beautifully plated and garnished, was a bit more of a miss. Though tender and fall off the bone, the meat was a little stringy and caught on one's teeth. While not exactly a big dish, both items were perfect for a light lunch.Price wise, everything was wallet friendly and the total damage amounted to about $25. Tables are squashed rather close together, and you're unlikely to go away with overhearing the conversations from neighbouring tables. All in all, a nice, albeit underwhelming venue for a casual lunch. Maybe the chicken will really fare better...",

Not only is the tenant mix a whole lot better, even the food is better! And that's how I discovered Poulet when I was there one day. Feeling a hungry, I decided to browse around and I have to say I was lured here simply because of the smell. I love my French cuisine, and smelling something so tasty, I knew I had to give it a try. And I wasn't disappointed. The roast chicken here is simply divine! The skin is crisp and the meat tender. And the sauce it rests on gives the entire dish a very tantalizing flavour and completes it. As I was here during the day, it was kind of hot dining here, partly due to the fact that the bistro sits beneath a skylight. So for those of you who shun the sun, come at night!",

It smells heavenly. The chicken was obviously the star of the place. The meat was tender and moist. It makes cutting the chicken an easy task. We tired the new cranberry sauce which was good. We ordered French fries and potato corn as sides.The French Onion Soup was worth to give it a try. It was thick and full of onions, the way I like it.For appetizers, we got saut\u00e9ed mushroom. It was good but the egg could be less cooked so that we can mix it with the mushrooms.For dessert, we ordered Tiramisu, it was disappointing. No taste of rum at all.The service was on the dot with water filled by the attentive servers. However, it seems hard to get their attention when the crowd started to come in.Overall, I will be back to taste other dishes and back for the chicken and French onion food. The prices are affordable as well.",
