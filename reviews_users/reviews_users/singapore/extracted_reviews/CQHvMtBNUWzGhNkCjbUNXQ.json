Anyway, my work people rave about GT all day every day, so I thought let me go see what all the fuss is about. \u00a0I ordered the upstream which was really really good. \u00a0The dressing was the real star, and although when you look at the amount of food you are getting, you start to panic, but you'll be full. \u00a0I promise. \u00a0You can also make your own salad, or bowl, or whatever, but they have some pretty good ones already put together. \u00a0The second one I tried had chicken, and more of a Mexican feel, but the upsteam was def. better. \u00a0For a meal, snack and water will run you $16. \u00a0Not cheap, but def. worth it. \u00a0I saw they also do breakfast, and have some interesting stuff going on, so looking forward to go when I have a free minute to spare in the AM. \u00a0Perfect for those who work in the CBD and need a quick, healthy lunch, or live in the area and need something after a work out, or on the way home from a late night at the office.",

    "text": "One of my favorite breakfast/lunch places when I wanted something healthy in Singapore!For breakfast, I've had their polenta and oatmeal. They give you two 2-3\" circular pieces of grilled polenta with greens, beans, and avocado. For oatmeal, it's a big hearty scoop with delicious toppings. Oatmeal's a little bit on the sweeter side but what I loved about it was how sticky it was. Both are $8 SGD which is a little bit pricey but totally worth it. For lunch, I usually make my own bowl. I've had their tuna, salmon, and chicken as protein with toppings such as apple kimchi, beans, and roasted veggies. For dressing, their beetroot feta yogurt, wasabi, and coconut curry were my favorites. All the ingredients are super fresh. I also love their concept- it's healthy with unique flavors! The only thing I wished they offered was giving the option of doing half greens and grains for the base (you can only get salad only or noodles/rice only).Service is super quick (even during peak hours) as it is in the hustle and bustle area of CBD. Definitely recommend this place to anyone in Singapore who is looking for something healthy and hearty!",

As everyone says, the quality is there, but for lunch, it may be too pricey for an every day occasion. HOWEVER, I did want to review something that most people don't think of when they think of Grain Traders: THE BAGEL SANDWICHES. Only $10 and you get: a bagel, a protein, a spread, a veggie, and something extra. I always get their plain bagels toasted (they only have 2 types of bagels unfortunately), with jalapeno cream cheese, cured salmon, avocado, and spinach. ALL THAT FOR JUST $10! Great deal! The only sad part is that breakfast is only available 8am-10:30am. Booooo. I want bagels for dinner!",

    "text": "Delicious.. BUT EXPENSIVE! I really don't understand. Does eating lunch in CBD has to be this expensive? I know there are bankers and lawyers but there are also underpaid consultants (aka me) and also others who earn a decent salary for a living. I call this pure indulgent eating here, and can only do it once a while. \u00a0That being said, Grain Traders serves really good, fresh food. I enjoyed my food here tremendously. It definitely reminds of the fuss- free, health-conscious restaurants you get in Australia or the US. The concept is the same like The Daily Cut, you can either order set meal called \"Hero Bowls\" or DIY your own lunch. Same price at $16 nett. Hero Bowls section comes in 6 choices but since I was hangry (read: hungry + angry), i head straight to the DIY section. For the price you get to choose: 1 grain (quinoa, brown rice, japanese rice, or soba)1 protein (beef, salmon or chicken)1 hot vege (various items to choose from)2 cold vege (various salads, kimchis etc)1 topping (no, im not talking about rainbow sprinkles or m&ms here)1 sauce (you MUST MUST try the MISO CARAMEL sauce!!)........................and you get a bowl of wholesome meal. There;s also a coffee bar on the other side of the restaurant that serves decent coffee at the price you get from 'bucks. I got myself a cup of latte and it was pretty good, at $5.50. I spent a total of $21.50 of lunch today, which is equivalent to almost 3 plates of normal mixed rice from the hawker center. Will i come back, yes. Maybe once every fortnight. Or else I might have to get a bank loan to eat here daily. Lunch crowd (12-1pm) tends to get overwhelming so come really early or late to avoid the madness. Service is prompt and efficient overall! p/s: The miso caramel sauce is as good as the maple butter syrup from clinton st bakery. I can drink it on its own, I swear",

In CBD, tons of people want healthier options, and this is definitely one of them. There are a lot of choices here, and possibilities seem endless.I'm usually the type who'd rather just choose whatever combos they offer, but none of them really appealed to me so I went the custom bowl route.You get to choose from lots of different grains, proteins, and veggie add-ons. Everything I chose tasted great: the charred corn, striploin steak, pickled capsicums, and the bean pico de gallo. Additionally you can choose a sauce, and that in itself took me a while because there was a lot and I wanted to try so many!Depending on what you get it could be $15-20. For Singapore, that's a pretty expensive lunch. To beat the crowd, you seriously have to go between 11-11:45, because once 12 comes around the queue spans the entire restaurant and there are no seats available.Enjoy your healthy lunch! I, on the other hand, just need to learn how to make all of these ingredients at home so I can assemble myself!",

There wasn't anyone in line after me at 2pm. Ok, maybe they were tired from lunch service.The quinoa was yummy. The beef ok... For the same price I could get just as yummy a salad without the bitchiest attitude from the whole bunch of staff. Not cool, Grain Traders!",

Coffee was alright but the juices were delicious. Definitely recommend, but seating is limited and it's super packed during lunch hours. Still, people don't eat for more than 15 mins on a busy work week so turnover is not slow. Steak is more filling and salmon is healthier. Husband said he also tried the pork which was good. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Will come during non peak hours since I'm in school anyway and don't have a set lunch time. Too bad they don't have one near my school (INSEAD) otherwise they would sell out so quick! Maybe do a pop up for a month or something. Anyway, right now daily cut and salad stop are the only healthy options. And class ends late so it would be nice if healthy options are open, not just bar food. Anyway, go and eat healthy here!",
