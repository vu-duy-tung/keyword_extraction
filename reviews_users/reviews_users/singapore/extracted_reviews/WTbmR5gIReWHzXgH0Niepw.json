    "text": "High fives go to O Comptoir for being one of the few restaurants open in Boat Quay on Sundays!I finally stopped here to try their much talked about crepes and I was not disappointed. These babies take up an entire square plate, and halfway through I was kinda regretting ordering the potato wedges as appetizer. My \"79\" crepe had potatoes, bacon, onion and Reblochon cheese, and although the hefty $21 price tag had me worried for a bit, it pulled through by getting me surprisingly full. If you're not into crepes, they do have a brasserie section where you can order other mains like tuna and asparagus (great if you're avoiding carbs) and a burger (which our other friends ordered- looked pretty good!)Next time, I'll avoid ordering the wedges and stick with a crepe and perhaps a dessert crepe to end my meal- I really want to get the Nutella one next time!",

    "text": "$16++ 3 course crepe lunches, this is truly a fantastic mid-day treat. A wide choice of crepe selection, I usually go for the No. 5 which is filled with all the ingredients that include ham, cheese, mushroom, tomatoes and a sunny side up egg. Appetizer is a garden salad and dessert is a trio of small bites that includes Apple crepe, chocolate puff and caramel crepe. The crepes are really good with nice crisp edges and a good amount of filling. The desserts though are small bites but are very satisfying. A great place to chill during lunch to catch a breather. Though filled with guests, it's not too crowded.",

    "text": "I think the crepe is better than those I recently ate in France! Don't kill me.The flour is savory and crispy, and just the right amount of thickness. The crepe is stuffed with jamon, two types of cheese, mushrooms and tomatoes. Plus a runny egg...which makes everything heavenly. They have great lunch sets that comes with a salad and a dessert. The dessert was disappointing as it was a sweet crepe that is much too thick. I can't even figure out what is in the crepe.Super chill out vibe at a corner shophouse where Archipelago used to be.",
