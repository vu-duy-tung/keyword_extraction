    "text": "Novena medical centre is exactly as you would expect - unremarkable corridors lined with doctors offices, waiting rooms, more doctors offices, yet more waiting rooms, and in the midst of all this, an unexpected outlier - a small and cosy Italian style cafe, serving up interesting ristretto shots. The inside is quite small and cosy, but the limited space is put to good use. A communal table lies in the centre of the room, flanked by counter seats, and a door that leads to a shaded outdoor seating area. Tampers and espresso shot cups line the shelves, while the staff pull shots at an open bar counter lined with espresso machines and grinders. I like the concept - it's always interesting to see the baristas at work, and for coffee geeks, to see the shots themselves being pulled. This can tell you a lot about the quality of coffee at a cafe - a spaghetti strand sized column of dark black liquid slowly lining a shot cup is a sign of good underlying espresso, while a 10 second downpour of pale brown liquid is a hint that you should quietly slip out the entrance without waiting for your drink. Fortunately, La Ristretto's shots were good examples of the former, with a 20 second extraction of potent espresso. \u00a0The espresso shot had a medium brown crema, and a robust, full bodied flavour with distinct hints of chocolate. It was bright without being bitter, and potent without being burnt. The shot glass of water on the side is a nice touch also, and was used, as the serving size is a little larger than usual for a single shot. The coffee beans used were from Agust coffee roasters in Italy, which I haven't come across in Asia before, and are quite distinct in their own right. It's also interesting to be able to sample a robust Italian style espresso, which contrasts with the trend for citrusy single origin shots that are on offer in a number of cafes at present. The latte that I ordered had smooth foam, and a large serving size. It was quite mild, but the underlying espresso shot was muted rather than being completely lost, and could easily be detected in the aftertaste. \u00a0This may be the result of the larger espresso shot sizes mentioned earlier. The overall character was of coffee rather than milk, so despite the serving size, it avoids the easy mistake of serving warm caffeinated warm milk, rather than coffee. The foam maintained it's integrity throughout, without breaking up - a small detail, but one that's consistent with correct steaming temperature and duration, and something that I've seen a few cafes get wrong in recent weeks.There is a good coffee menu on offer, with the usual combinations of espresso and milk, and brewed coffees. One thing that differs is the presence of shakerato on the menu (a shaken cold espresso), that I have not seen before, and something that I'm genuinely curious to see made. Prices were as expected, at 8.50 for the latte and espresso above.Overall, La Ristretto's is interesting in that they are serving something genuinely different, and it's an opportunity to try a fairly authentic Italian espresso. The location may be an issue for some, in that it's in the middle of a medical centre, rather than in a standalone cafe. This should not deter you from visiting during non peak hours however, especially if you happen to be in the area. However do bear in mind that the cafe itself is quite small, so please let patients and staff take priority!",

Only cash and NETS was accepted here.Flat White (S$5)An Australian origin, similar to a caffe latte and is distinguished by thinner froth on top. The drink was served in a cup with no holder. The drink was rich and thick.Breakfast Crab Cake ($15)Potatoes, Pancetto, Avocados, Poached Egg, Wild RocketsThe crab cake tasted a tab fishy, but quite meaty. Interesting the potatoes was presented like a mashed potato patty.Pear Tart ($8)Baked pear tart with vanilla gelatoThe serving was bigger than expected, about the size of a small pan. The tart smelt quite delicious when served. The crust was light and crispy, and sliced through easily. As it was served hot, the gelato melt rather easily. Overall the food was not bad and the place was quite relaxing.",

    "text": "In the back of my mind La Ristrettos has always been just another cute hipster cafe. But they've upped their game with their pancake offerings!Savory pancakes ($11) - 5 starsMy first-world brunch problem has always been \"I really want the pancakes/French toast with caramelized bananas and ice cream but I'll feel sick after a few bites and wish I ordered something savory.\" La Ristrettos solves this with their savory pancakes: two huge pancakes with a mass of scrambled eggs and bacon with a side of maple syrup. I asked if I could substitute the bacon for some sort of vegetable and the lady kindly offered spinach. The cherry (cheese) on top was that they cooked the spinach and garnished it with a dollop of ricotta. I suppose from bad experiences elsewhere I was expecting them to say no, or just give me a few token raw greens, so this was such a pleasant surprise. The scrambled eggs were creamy and substantial and the pancakes were gigantic and fluffy! These were the pancakes I'd expected Clinton St to have, and that I've been looking for! No more $20 tiny pancakes thank you.They also offer sweet pancakes with vanilla gelato and salted caramel that I'm going to have to come back to try.",

The reason they do not have decaffeinated coffee is because they only serve their own in-house roasted beans and am not interested in the complicated decaffeination process. There is food too, mainly pasta. Indoor and outdoor seatings. Relaxing atmosphere with nice music (inside) and if you like the sound of iron beams being jack hammered into place, you can sit outside (until the hotel is completed, that is).",

And while I usually complain about the standard of coffee in cafes around Singapore, I also frown at the hefty price tags many popular coffee establishments place on my favourite caffeinated drink. I found out about this gem of a place by some chance encounter some years back and I remember being pleasantly surprised by how a cafe that actually got its coffee right was able to keep itself hidden in a little corner of a medical centre. While I feared that it would eventually close due to a lack of awareness from the community, I'm glad that it's not only doing well, but also getting a lot of positive attention (which it fully deserves) in recent years. The ambience here is classy. Very nicely spruced up decor - if the indoor seating gets a little too cramped, the outdoor area has plenty of sitting space too. The food here is a little on the pricey side, but definitely worth giving a shot. The coffee, however, is where it shines. Definitely one of my favourite coffee haunts in central Singapore.",

    "text": "It's places like La Ristrettos that make me thankful that I Yelp.Why do I say that? First of all, the chances of finding this place is pretty low. It's in the most random location ever- the 8th floor of the fairly new Novena Medical Center. There are no advertisements around Square 2 or anywhere else around the medical center (at least, that I've noticed) so unless you have a doctor's appointment on the 8th floor, you'll never know this place even existed! But thanks to Yelp, you are now cooler and better person. :)I loved the ambiance of this place. It's quite cozy, with cute, vintage coffee signs on the walls. They have high-tech machines that make badass brews. The free pitchers of ice water with orange slices was a nice touch. They were also playing some classic Frank Sinatra while I was there, which put me in an even better mood. I wanted to have breakfast, but most of their breakfast offerings seemed too heavy for me. They had dishes like croissants and frittatas, but they all come with salads, which I simply wasn't in the mood for. (Also, who has salads for breakfast?!) I did see some smaller offerings in their counter, but it wasn't well labelled and I didn't feel like asking about them. I ended up settling for a banana and a cappuccino. I'm not a big coffee drinker, so all I can say is that I did enjoy my cappuccino and I thought it was fairly priced at $5. Bottom line, my first visit was a success. If they could offer smaller bakery items and free wifi, they would really win me over. If you have time before your medical appointment, or even if you're just hanging around the Square 2/Velocity/Tan Tock Seng area and you're craving an upscale coffee experience, ignore Starbucks and give La Ristrettos a try.",

    "text": "La Ristrettos is hidden away on the 8th floor of the Novena Medical Center. \u00a0Sure, there is a sign by the entrance to the elevator lobby but without actively seeking out the spot or unless you happen to be a patient on the 8th floor, you would never find this place, which would be your loss. \u00a0La Ristrettos serves some excellent coffee and food, which would put the other coffee places in Novena to shame. \u00a0Start with the coffee and the name sake - ristretto. \u00a0They actually have a ristretto pulled espresso on the menu! \u00a0Sure, you can ask a barrista to use less water, but here it's a given. \u00a0But their lattes and cappuccinos are also really good - love the strong coffee against a creamy backdrop. \u00a0But the surprise would have to be the breakfast sandwiches. \u00a0I had the one with eggs and pancetta, and it was delicious! \u00a0Yes it's a little pricey at $11 but totally worth it. \u00a0 By using pancetta, I didn't get that nasty surprise - turkey bacon. \u00a0And the bread was amazing - a little hard on the outside but chewy, I would have loved to take a few and use them for a proper Philly cheesesteak. \u00a0Service may be a little slow, but it's really worth the wait for the hand crafted coffee drinks and food. \u00a0Plus the view of a secret garden is so peaceful, you hardly notice.",

    "text": "La Ristrettos is hidden on the 8th floor of Novena Medical Centre. If you haven't been here, you probably wouldn't know that this cafe existed. This building is directly connected to Novena MRT Station and it's very easy to find (just take the exit towards square 2). Not to worry, there are lots of parking lots in this building.It's a small and quiet cafe. Since this place is so secluded, there aren't a lot of customers especially during weekdays. This cafe is probably catered towards providing a nice and cozy environment for surgeons to take a break from their hectic schedules or to discuss some work over a nice cup of coffee. 3G reception is poor here, fortunately they provide free WiFi.They is a big table placed in the centre (that can probably fit 10 people) and a long table top (with red plastic chairs) facing the garden.The interior is filled with wooden furniture, with fake bricks embedded onto the walls. Outdoor seats are also available in the garden for you to breathe in some fresh air. Besides, this cafe is tax-free - you could save a couple of bucks!I ordered their Macchiato ($3.50). The coffee is smooth and tastes great. Could have been much better with some caramel to sweeten things up! I later found out that they are the sole distributor of Caffe Agust Beans which is an Italian coffee brand that is organic and certified 100% Fairtrade.I love the presentation of the food here! Food is served in brightly coloured dishes on a nice wooden tray. I tried their Grande breakfast set ($14.00). You have 3 choices for the egg (either poached, scrambled or sunny side). Served together with mushrooms, sausage, salad and 2 slices of sourdough. Sausage and salad dressing was good. However, bacon was burnt and quite tough. Poached eggs were a disappointment - it's overcooked!For coffee lovers, this is the place to go. Food is satisfactory, not good enough to keep me coming back. As for me, I think I'll only come back for their coffee, provided I'm around the area.Signing Off,Zhan HaoFounder of TheCafection",

    "text": "\"I need coffee so badly\"\"Quick! I'll take you to the hospital\"Well, that's not quite the reaction I was imagining when needing a coffee on a recent trip to Singapore. I mean, I know I'm a caffeine addict but a visit to the hospital? Really?Turns out there's a cafe serving good coffee in amongst the long and hidden corridors of the Novena Medical Centre. You'll ride the lift with people heading off to see there acupuncturist, gynaecologist, \u00a0allergist, neurologist, dermatologist... and you'll feel both smug and shameful all at the same time because you're heading off to see Doctor Coffee and have no ailments at all, except for a terrible addiction.",

There is limited seating inside, but there is a whole garden outside for you to explore! Why stay indoors! Zen out sipping on your espresso while watching leaves drop into the little pond in the center of the garden. If you're looking for coffee that is bold and strong. You've found the right place. To all you third wave coffee lovers out there, you're going to be disappointed if you were looking for something fruity and juicy. *Free wifi available.",
