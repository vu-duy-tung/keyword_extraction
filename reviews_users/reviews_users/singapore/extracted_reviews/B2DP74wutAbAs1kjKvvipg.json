    "text": "A lovely setting for beautiful food, Antoinette is just the kind of cafe I would expect in posh Mandarin Gallery. From its lavish French decor to its many cream-based desserts, it probably does not come as a surprise that the prices are equally 'atas'. The one area that was lacking though is the service that could have been better suited to the environment. There seemed to be a shortage of staff the last time I went, and it not only took us awhile to be served, but the waitress did not seem very happy to be serving either.The desserts, in my opinion, are very French with lots of mousse and layered treats, and rather innovative and delicate-looking. The tastes had a few hits and misses. I quite liked Le Royale and most of their chocolate-based desserts. The earl grey in Antoinette was hardly there the first time I tried it but delightfully infused the second time. I did not like the Baba pastry very much. I would definitely be back, mostly for the ambience and the gorgeous desserts but I wouldn't go too often.",

It was served with a rubber yellow duck sitting on the meringue. So cute looking. The drink was refreshing with cubes of mango sitting in the bottom. Interestingly it was not served with a spoon and had to request for one.French Toast with Ham and Cheese ($14++)Served with creme chantilly Brioche bread sandwiched with Swiss Gruyere \u00a0cheese cream, Paris ham served with salad tossed in house dressing.Could not taste the cheese cream in the bread, nor could see it. The bread looked average not the kind of brioche bread which I was expecting.Ondeh Ondeh Queen's Castella Cake ($11+)Made using fresh fragrant pandan leaf, and studded with gula melaka bits with hints of coconut.It was like pandan chiffon cake, with filling in between.",

    "text": "It's funny how people still cannot differentiate the difference between a macaron and macaroon. When in doubt, always remember there is a dictionary or internet.So let me start by reviewing my favorite to go place to have a nice afternoon tea in Singapore. Antoinette ie. The decor, ambience and pastries, there is nothing I dislike about. I love them all. It is definitely the kind of place I feel in harmony with. If I ever have a cafe, I will model it after Antoinette.Antoinette to me is a place for pastries/tea, a place for great ambience and a place where girls can go and enjoy having a nice get together. Someone I know dislike the place, called the atmosphere at Antoinette too stuffy. Oh well, if one can't sit/behave properly, enjoys talking loudly/crudely or basically prefers fast food joints, this is definitely not a place I will suggest. The pastries, though not a huge variety, have always been very good. I am someone who always look for quality and not quantity. The orchid tea is excellent, something that I do not find it in anywhere else. The French toast with caramelized banana is to die for too.Service here ranged from good to very good. I wish the place takes reservation, I do not fancy standing in line at all. Looking forward to my next visit when I travel to Singapore. Hopefully, everything I love about Antoinette remains the same.",

Named after the last queen of France, they serve all sorts of decadent pastries and desserts, as well as western cuisine.I was really impressed by the attention to detail. It felt very parisian and proper, which had very strange effects on me. I felt like I had to sit up straight, drink tea with my pinky finger raised and say \"Oui\" a lot. I ordered the Classic Eggs Florentine, and it came on a monogrammed plate, of course. The toasted brioche used was exceptionally good, the eggs perfectly poached, and the salad on the side was fresh and light, balancing my meal perfectly.I also had the French toast with salted caramel, which my taste buds adored. It came in 3 thick slices drizzled with maple syrup and a light dusting of icing sugar. Large dollops of cr\u00e8me chantilly, which is basically whipped cream. But at Antoinette, their whipped cream is extra creamy and rich!Coffee here was rather disappointing, even if it did come in a pretty monogrammed set. My pinky dinger refused to bend, no matter what I did.I would definitely recommend this place for a special date as the ambience is really more romantic and cosy. Or a girly tea gathering. Oui. It's not a big restaurant, so do make bookings if you are coming during peak hours on weekends especially. Will update my review once I try their dinner menu! :)",

From the Versailles decor to the Menu - the place does reek of French design, classy and not gaudy. The line is very thin - but the restaurant manages to look chic and exude that seamlessly - from the cutlery, to the tea, to the service, etc. This place is famous for it's Macaroons, though I was so stuffed after dinner that I had no space for them. But my friend took some away! Like a whole box!!What I Love: The Menu has all-day breakfast, which I love. It wasn't the typical American breakfast, hash, etc. - but the eggs were semi-done, the bread was yummmmy... and the sausage was fresh and very very tasty. The main comes with bacon too, which I so loved! I got the set, the Antoinette's Breakfast - which comes with a main, pastries and a drink, for which I got the hot chocolate... it really was melted chocolate - and not just a standard mix. The last time I had such hot chocolate was in Paris itself!What I Don't Love: The prices. It's pretty steep.... like $20 for a main, if you get a set? But a set and a drink will set you back $25-$30.",

All sorts of croissants, tarts and macaroons are displayed with their buttery finishes and glazes shining under the light (seriously they were shining). \u00a0The service staff aren't very well trained though. \u00a0The waiter tried clearing my plate before I was finished and I had to stop him with my plate already mid way in the air cos he was so fast and didn't even ask if I was done, and when the bill came they had overcharged us by placing another item that we hadn't ordered on the bill.

According to her website, Antoinette \"will set the benchmark for the pastry and dessert scene not only in Singapore, but also in the region with her takes on time-honoured French classic desserts\". After reading this tremendous boast, one would expect this to be among the best pastry stores in Singapore. Unfortunately, they fell short.Enter the Antoinette, an earl grey infused chocolate mousse cake topped with raspberry coulis. While the mousse was smooth and luscious, the thick sac spoiled the experience for me. (Haha) I'm not sure what the deal with the sac was, but it was extremely hard to pop. Extracting the coulis while maintaining the integrity of the cake was a chore.When a consumer buys macarons, they look for the most aesthetically pleasing one. Unfortunately, most of the ones in Antoinette's display case had a bumpy surface. The dense macarons tasted as bad as they look.While it would be unfair to compare Antoinette to established tea salons such as Laduree, it is safe to say I won't be back.Don't believe the hype.Note:Props to the design & marketing team for trying to appeal to the francophile in us.",

Having used to patronise Canele in the past, I was surprised to find many similar elements here as Canele. The crepes are presented in the same manner, and seeing the Strawberry Shortcake, Mont Blanc, Le Royale and certain macarons on the display was uncanny. However, Antoinette definitely covered the Salon de Th\u00e9 vibe well, almost felt as if I was in France. The tea selection was extensive and the caramel tea I had matched my hopes exactly. Macarons were not bad either, though not the best I've tasted. The onion soup was a slight let down - although the flavour of the broth was good, I personally prefer a thicker and heartier soup, and the cheese crust that covered the top of the bowl did not do the soup any favours.",

Hot chocolate (7.00) is pretty much a must try, not too sweet neither too thick and creamy, proportion + taste was 'just nice'! You wouldn't believe it, but It makes a good thirst quencher! Ps: love the interior decor with its fine upholstery. Absolutely comfortable and lovely! Simply Western :)",

The macaron shells are slightly dry and hard. Hence they are fairly decent but not the best versions in town so far.",
