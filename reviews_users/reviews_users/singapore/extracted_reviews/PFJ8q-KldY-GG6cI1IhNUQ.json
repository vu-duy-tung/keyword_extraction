    "text": "I really enjoy my moment in that resto, they have some more outlets across singapore, i went to in zion road after church st. Bernardeth. The place itself not big and spacious, good enough for singapore anyway We celebrate my birthday there and what i love as well aside from their food, the bring the cake with a happy birthday singing lovely... Feel so warm! Not many resto in singapore doing it! Okay lets star reviewing the food, we were like 20 people and we order one giant pizza like 21inch bacon miele (pork) sgd55 taste really good! Love it We also order prosciutto crudo di parma (pork) - combination of parma ham and rocket salad, love the combination, the salad give a vegie taste to neutralize the pork taste (im not really a fan of pork though) Pizza margherita - not that special like the taste of margherita We also order chicken wings and calamari - they are ok but not outstanding.Overall the highest rating given with combination of everything place and staffs are warm enough and the food love it so much! Will come back for sure",

    "text": "We had our first taste of their wonderful giant pizzas at the Greenwood outlet and when they started to branch out to the various parts of Singapore. We were honestly quite happy. Seafood Pasta - I have always appreciated the fresh seafood and the amount of seafood in the dish is really quite enough. I would say that I prefer it more flavourful (more salt pls) but hubby tried and said it's me. :PGaint Pizzas - we had 2 giants so that 4 flavours altogether. The pizzas were very well received by everyone. \u00a0Kids like the square shape pizzas they cut them into and happily dug in with their hands. We were a part of 5 adults and 4 kids, and still had to doggie-bag quite a bit of pizzas. Oh well, hubby was happy to be able to have more pizzas for the subsequent days. Definitely a place to return to. Should call to reserve seating in the future so that we can eat in aircon comfort.",

The plan was to have some pizza, a couple of beer and then catch a movie like a proper boys night out. Little did we know that we were chased away by 730pm. We were not told we had to scarf down our food and beer with 6ppl in 1.5hrs! They insisted that they told us even though they obviously didn't. They even took our order of a glass of red wine and a pint of beer and expected us to be done in 5mins.The most outrageous part was when they decided to waive the beer and glass of wine and rather take back the beer that had already been consumed, DIRECTLY from my friends hand and throw it out rather then let him finish it since they waved it so they can chase us off their premises.This was one of the most shocking displays of service I have ever encountered with a bill close to $200.Oh well.. There will always be service staff who behaves this way. Lesson learnt.",

    "text": "We were really glad when Peperoni Pizzeria opened up a branch in our neck of the woods as Greenwood Ave and Binjai, their earlier outlets were a bit out of the way for us. However, it seemed we weren't the only glad ones as it's always packed to the brim when we swing by, so we could only get the XXL pizzas to go. This time, we decided to make a reservation and have a proper dinner there.We got the calamari and pancetta pizza to start while waiting for one of our friends to arrive ... the calamari was pretty decent and went well with the mayo and salsa dip provided. The pancetta pizza was pretty good except we would have preferred the egg to be runny like the one from Spizza. Love the peach and banana smoothies! We then proceeded to get the pepperoni pizza and the Amatriciana (linguini with smoky bacon & saut\u00e9ed onions in zesty tomato sauce) when our friend arrived, before ending off with a tiramisu to share.Everything was pretty good for a casual pizza joint and service was pretty efficient. We'll definitely be back!",

I will recommend for the salmon pizza which is really good and served in large portion. A must have when I'm having my meal there is the tiramisu. Well.
