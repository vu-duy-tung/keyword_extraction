So no reason distinction as it is battered.There actually wasn't a line when I went..just a guy in front of me. Ordering was painless...They give you a bowl of the broth(which I thought would be more fluid but it was kinda thick...Like gelatinous. I shuttle have preferred reg liquid consistency). Then you had your condiments in nearby bowls.If you are doing take away, they wrap each component in separate little bags(noodle, fish..etc)..so when you get home you just dump then into bowl. It was tasty actually but again I would prefer a more liquid broth as the thickness was a bit overwhelming for me.",

    "text": "To get things started, I don't like my food drenched in gravy. Dishes like Lor Mee, Hor Fun and Mee Fun incur my wrath - how can you enjoy the flavours when everything is soaked in thick gravy? Fortunately, Lor Mee 178 was worth the plunge and is probably the only Lor Mee I'll ever eat. (Please stay that way forever.)Here's the breakdown: you get a bowl of noodles in the thick brown gravy but that's not all, you also have fried shark meat, crispy fritter bites and more crunchy stuff topped onto your noodles. That might be what made it for me. The mix of crunchy with flavourful sauce that not too starchy and good noodles that blends with the sauce. I've read very opposing views on this dish, perhaps from people who prefer to more traditional braised variety but I like this adaptation. I will travel just for this one.",

    "text": "It's so damn hard finding good lor mee in Singapore - also, it seems like it no longer is one of those dishes you can easily find at any food court so that makes the search even tougher. So, in light if these circumstances, Lor Mee 178 acts as one of my trusty haunts I fall back on when I just have to get a bowl.The gravy is fantastic - it has good flavour of the stock but isn't overwhelmingly starchy. What I really like about this stall is the shark nuggets! Actually, it iss really just fried fish bits that sound a little more exotic. The crispiness adds a good texture to the dish. Each bowl also comes along with the usual braised egg, pork belly and ngoh hiang.Ask for extra everything - vinegar, garlic paste, chilli sauce. Best way to enjoy this dish is to go over the top.",

Make sure, however, to throw in shark nuggets for an additional 50 cents. These chewy and tasty morsels really propel the dish to giddying heights.I usually go a little crazy with the condiments, generously adding vinegar, garlic paste and chilli to the mix... but isn't that how lor mee is best enjoyed? Definitely a must-try, and easily a destination for those looking out for the best lor mee stalls in Singapore.",

    "text": "Lor Mee that kicks ass but might not get you kisses.Tiong Bahru market, another food paradise of Singaporean delights.What to eat? Obviously, you're not one who's keen on wasting tummy space... if not you wouldn't be reading a review.Well, Jonny boy is here to help. Do you like Lor mee? If so, Don't waste time. Order from this stall. Served with deep fried shark meat and super crunchy flour crumbs, this Lor mee is heavenly. Gravy that's thick and full of tasty vinegary goodness. The shark meat (I don't take shark's fin's soup because of the cruel ways they 'hunt' for these but I figure if they used the whole shark, there's no issue) is deep fried and it kinda reminds me of fish and chips, without the chips.You are given free reign of garnishes so I recommend piling on the freshly cut chilli and lots of garlic. Your breath will smell for at least two hours (non garlic eaters would never kiss you) but it's worth it. Corporate rats be sure to confirm that you have no client meetings after your meal! Unless you get them to go with you for the Lor Mee.",

Even if it does not turned out to be super delicious, it won't be too bad either. \u00a0Fortunately, the Lor Mee($2.50) falls into the first category. Perhaps what draws regular crowd is the Shark Meat Fritters (add 50cents) and the braised gravy. Mix all the chilli sauce, grated ginger, vinegar, gravy, some crunchy stuff together with the noodles and you'll get a simple, comforting bowl of Lor Mee minus the braised egg and ngor hiong.",

The shark meat is coated in a light batter and fried into crispy nuggets. When you bite into it, the meat is tender and you can taste the freshness of the shark meat. It goes very well with the thick lor mee gravy and yellow noodles.",

    "text": "Given the popularity of sharks fin soup in Asia, I find it curious that we don't see more restaurants selling sharks meat. Sharks meat is what gives this veteran of Tiong Bahru market its uniqueness. It serves a mean bowl of lor mee for $2.50 - for an additional $0.50 they'll toss in a few pieces of fried sharks meat in your bowl. Like fish fritters, it tastes awesome when eaten crispy, especially when it is soaked in starchy lor mee sauce to give it that delightful balance of crunchy soupiness. While the fritters themselves were well fried, I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the sharks meat and normal fish, though. Having this exotic dish already also means the stall could scrimp on more traditional accompaniments to lor mee - I couldn't find many pieces of egg, or ngoh hiong in my bowl of noodles, which, if not for the sharks meat, was nothing spectacular. Still worth visiting though, if only to check it off your list of must-tries in Singapore.",
