When order arrived, I asked for an additional box realizing they likely don't have plates so my daughter could share the food without spilling all over but Eric was reluctant to give us an additional box. I wouldn't come back again to a place where customers are made to beg for an additional box which I doubt would be a difference in profit or loss.

I'd died and gone to wino heaven when I saw the beautiful shelves of wine from around the world at very reasonable prices. A lot of it comes from Australian producers I know quite well. When I worked out the conversion rate and mark up it seemed cheaper than what I'd get back at home in a restaurant... and there's the trick... P.S isn't exactly a restaurant. It's essentially a bottle shop, so prices have tax included in the price and there's no service charge added. Awesome! Either take a bottle home, or if you want to sit and drink it there you can order a \"take away\" lunch or dinner from the menu and eat it from the cardboard containers.We snacked on a giant cone of fries liberally dosed in salt, truffle and cheese (I think it was Pecorino) and washed them down with glasses of Australian Riesling for a mere $8 per glass! We might have accidentally shared a slice of the super zesty key lime pie too. Oops.",

    "text": "I love PS cafe downtown. So when one opened in Tiong Bahru, I was very happy about it. Finally went to check it out with a Friend. Take away menu only. Okieeeeeee ... Then what's with all the nice nice places to sit and the pretty pretty deco? Anyways... Was given a seat, given the menu, and was told to go order at the counter. Which is all well and good - a lot of cafes does that. Menu is kinda basic, don't expect a lot to choose from. And after paying, was told that I had to collect my food as well. Okieeeeee... Bear in mind the kind of prices you are paying .... Order pizza, a salad, a cuppa coffee and a juice. When I went to collect the food, all were in paper boxes.... But ok, they did say take away only. The salad came in the box and we were suppose to share so I went to ask for another box. I was told that they don't give any more boxes. \u00a0was the expression on my face. Went to take two paper cups to use as container to share out the salad. Not the most environmentally friendly kinda place. And for the a-bit-above-average-cafe-prices that you are paying, I think it's only right to expect a wee bit more. That said, if you are willing to pay that price for take away only, you are in luck, because the food is decent. I liked their pizza but the whole experience really put me off. If I wanna go back to a PS cafe, will go to the one downtown.",

    "text": "Well, this place hit the spot for me.A colleague of mine was leaving the company, so we did lunch here on her last day. I've tried their pastas in the past, and although they're delicious, I found them a bit small portion-wise. I decided to try their panini and now I'm in love.I ordered the veggie Morrocan, which comprises of portabello mushrooms, eggplant, and zucchini along with some cheese and other spices. It had beautiful grill marks and they used thin, flat bread. It was pricy at $14, but at least I felt full afterwards!If you're dining with a friend, I do recommend splitting one of the pizzas. The all day breakfast one looks hangover worthy as it has 2 fried eggs on top, and judging from the rest of my colleagues' orders, anything with meat looks appetizing.They also offer baked goods and ice cream. I won't lie; I indulged myself by having a scoop of their apple crumble ice cream. It was amazing and worth $6 plus the Jillian Michaels kickboxing exercise video I had to suffer through after I got home from work!The ambiance here is top notch. Dark, marble interiors surrounded by affordable wine bottles that tempt you to do a boozy lunch. What's not to love? Well, in the past, this used to be a takeaway spot, but now they have seating available.... Yet they still want to emphasize their takeaway roots by serving everything in takeaway containers. I think this just generates more excessive waste if you plan on eating in. Just invest in some real plates and silverware already, you guys can obviously afford it!",

    "text": "Ok, if it's any indication of how big a fan I am, I've been here approximately 4 times in slightly over a month ever since Josh T. introduced me to this place. (Giving credit where credit is due) It's located near my workplace (10 minutes at a moderate walking pace) and I've been making trips here for spontaneous dinners after work, or when I have an hour or so to burn.I've tried the garlic flatbread, the TRUFFLE garlic flatbread, the fennel sausage pizza, the caesar salad, the chicken rossa penne and 2 flavors of ice cream (hazelnut and some other one that I can't remember offhand).The garlic flatbread comes in thin triangular slices, almost like a thin-crust pizza, and is very very garlicky and satisfying, though the portion is huge for one. Even with 2 we were stuffed. Best shared amongst a group of 4 (there are 8 slices). The truffle version was good but I didn't think it was worth the additional $4.The pizza was unique and the kurobuta pork and fennel sausages complemented each other nicely. I'm not a big fan of tomatoes and the tomato was strong in this one. I felt that the crust, while thin, could be less dense and doughy. Pizzeria Mozza is still my preferred place when it comes to pizzas in general, but this is a worthy competitor.The chicken rossa penne was ok, again the tomato was strong in this one. Al dente penne is served in a tomato-cream sauce with what I thought was a pile of melted cheese on the top (but the menu mentions spinach, chicken and mushrooms). They serve their stuff in takeaway boxes, with the pasta separate from the dressing, so you have to pour in the sauce yourself. The pasta itself was nicely cooked but this dish failed to impress. Their ice cream is $6, a tad pricey but the first time I was there, I was given two huge scoops (I smiled nicely). It was delicious, smooth and creamy with the distinct taste of hazelnut. The second time was also good but not as wonderful as the first (I suspect this is why I can't remember what I ate).Oh and it says \"takeaway\" everywhere but there are actually enough seats for about 15 people inside. And a clean toilet.",

Crust is not bad, pretty thin and crusty. Spaghetti Bolognese - daughter liked it enough but I tried a mouthful and it was only so-so. Not a dish to go there for.Chicken Cream Pasta - I actually forgot the actual name on the menu but the taste is unforgettable!!

(They're also open for lunch, but I'm not sure if a bottle of wine makes for good post-lunch productivity.)The majority of the pizzas here are just awesome. The Biachi Funghi, a mushroom with truffle cream white pizza is delicious. Earthy, rich, savoury, I think I'd be able to finish this myself. The Fennel Sausage and Breakfast pizza are also both delicious and highly recommended.The pizzas definite must be eaten hot, and when they are, they're gooey, delicious, and wonderful. I've gone to PS.Cafe Petit more times than I can remember, whether for lunch, or to grab a pizza to bring home, or just for a salad when I'm not inclined to all the local food on offer in the area.This is possibly one of the most underrated pizza joints in Singapore, and while I wouldn't say it's better than Mozza, I can't say it's worse either. My one lament is that they discontinued their Puttanesca pizza, an anchovy-tuna umami bomb on dough. WHY PS.CAFE PETIT TEAM. WHY DO YOU HATE ME.",

Despite also being a test kitchen for PS Cafe, it is beautifully decorated with chrome, faux brick and black wood paneling. The menu is written on the chalkboard and has a wall full of wine to go along with the pizzas. The selection is simple. Purely pizza and 1 salad option. As it is not a full fledged cafe or restaurant, they are not allowed to serve food on plates and cups etc. The pizza came in a box and drinks are in a take-away plastic or paper cups. Plastic cutlery and napkins are provided if you wish to have a quick meal on the premises. But seriously, the place is not meant dining in. If you want to eat there, it will be better to either come at non peak (read lunch or dinner hours). It is definitely a very nice place to wait for your pizza to be ready and have a drink or so while waiting. There is a small selection of gigantic muffins for sale too. They look temptingly delicious. The four cheese porcini was very good, just out of the oven and made with fresh ingredients. The salad with blueberries, pine nuts, wolfberries, sunflower seeds etc was equally to die for. I love the freshness of the food. I am not sure if the pizza will hold up well if you need to travel for long as the steam will usually make pizza a bit soggy after a while. But this is a great find for fantastic pizza for those living in the Tiong Bahru area.",

A glass of wine, pizzas to share and ice cream afterwards makes it the ideal venue to enjoy some of the best that the PS. brand has to offer. It's the smokey, crisp and slightly chewy crust is what makes the pizzas from PS. Petit stand out. The service can vary when they get busy, but the upside is - there's no service charge.",
