I don't feel wow'd but they are decent. Skip the beef cheek Benedict though. While tender and soft, it was devoid of any beefy flavors.The waffle is worth a mention. Love the crispy outside!",

Had brunch with family here and service was spotty and the food wasn't timed well at all. \u00a0Dishes were coming out sporadically with long waits between them. Someone had asked if they could omit bacon from the avocado wrap but we were told they couldn't because they are pre-rolled. I mean that's pretty lazy shit if you can't make an avocado wrap to order. Ironically I ordered the avocado roll and was among the last to be served even though it was already pre-made and all they did was microwave it. You can taste the lack of effort in the wrap which was a trend repeated among all the other dishes from salmon in broth to the angus cheeseburger - sloppy, lacking flavor, and miserly portions. The only saving grace is that the space is quite comfortable but hardly worth the price. You can get way better elsewhere.",

Many have commented about the food, which is just decent, nothing spectacular. I'm not so generous. It was food that I could have prepared at home, and probably would have made it better. And for the price they charge, you do feel cheated. Especially since it's park land, and rental suppose to be lower. And then there's the service, which many point out as a positive. I do agree, the staff are friendly, but they could be a lot more efficient and attentive to details. For example, we were a table of 6, but they only provided 5 sets of cutlery in the little pail, coffee came without the sugar etc. And so there was always the additional need to summon their attention when it could have been avoided. And don't get me started about how long it took to settle the bill, longer than it took to eat my salad!So go, but only if you have a dog. There's little reason otherwise.",

The peaceful and considerably quiet environment created a nice, calming ambience which is great for catch up with friends without the need to shout across tables. We had 1 toddler and 1 baby in toll, felt the environment made the kids more relaxed.I have been to this park many times but this is my first time dining at this cafe. We were there at 9am, and were the only customers for quite awhile before 4 more patrons arrived.Almost all of us ordered the grilled breakfast. A decent size/portion for the price. It was enjoyable and filling. Their coffee was not great though. Latte felt bland.The parking lot is directly in front of the cafe which is great. There are also bus stop which are very close by too.Overall, a peaceful cafe to hang out with friends and families.",

The nuggets looked and tasted like cheap, frozen ones - they're so easy to make from scratch! I'm pretty certain the fries were frozen out of a bag too. I had the cheese burger which while tasty, loved the bacon jam, came on a pre-made bun. Again, so easy to make from scratch. Husband had the avocado wrap which looked and tasted great.Service was pretty good and as I mentioned it is a lovely setting inside the park. I'm thinking that if you just did the brunch options the food might be better but I was quite underwhelmed by the experience.",

Ordered its eggs benedict, which was described on the menu to come with \"perfectly poached eggs\" - at below $15! Eggs were indeed \"perfectly poached\" Sufficiently savory, but somehow lacklustre as a whole! I guess the poached eggs could really do with more hollandaise sauce!Had its sticky date dessert dish which was the only tempting item in the sweets section of the menu! Would give it a 6 out of 10!Lovely service! Good prices! But the place is just a tad too inaccessible for diners who don't drive. For diners who drive - loads of parking lots just outside of the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon!",

    "text": "The canopy garden dining and bar is set within the refurbished bishan park which makes it a nice setting for a weekend brunch or drinks after dinner.Their eggs benedict and eggs florentine are both quite good. I have also tried their okonomiyaki pancake and it just tasted a bit strange. I just didn't get it.I have been here for drinks and would not really reccommend it for the quality for their drinks. But the ambience is actually quite good for a quiet chat. So, just focus on the surroundings and your company, more than the drinks available.Another thing about canopy is that dogs are allowed in here, which is very cool. So there are quite a few pet owners with their dogs here especially during weekends. Hence, if you are allergic to furry cute dogs, it may be a good idea to steer clear during the weekends.I think the food, drinks and service really warrants about 3 stars but I just really like the idea of dining within a lovely park so this gets 3.5 stars! Do try this place if you are in the area.",

I do know that this is quite a hidden find and a cool spot to visit. Situated in the very pleasant Bishan Park, you can drive in and park quite easily. Walk a little inside and you're surrounded by greenery. It is very cooling even in the day and doggie-friendly. At night it transforms into a great place for some drinks (slightly overpriced) with a easy and open-air atmosphere.For a place like Bishan/AMK, this place just adds a bit more of the chic-ness to the area that is not too heartland. Great for dates!",
