    "text": "This place is a truly a gem. At most restaurants, the highlight is typically the meat, but I'd have to argue that the highlight of this joint is the noodles. Incredibly bouncy, with none of the artificial preservatives tastes, cooked in the most traditional Hong Kong style, I'm told.I had an order of the wonton noodles and a side of brisket and tendon, all of which were to die for. Portions are a little on the smaller side, but I'm told the noodles are in a bigger bowl now than a year ago. Wontons are still small, but the portion of brisket and tendon is fairly generous. It better be, at costing 150% the cost of my wonton noodles...No water is served, drinks need to be ordered off of the menu. The food is worth it, but don't expect to leave feeling full.",

    "text": "I don't know if it is just me or what, but I find the shrimp wanton tastes like the CP frozen shrimp wanton. I forgot how the noodle was served in a regular rice bowl. I had the beef brisket with shrimp wanton noodle so the bowl was just slightly bigger. I felt the portion was small but I was not sure if it was because I was used to the bigger bowls served in Crystal Jade and Imperial Treasure. I would say the portion filled me up to 75% full so it was probably good if one wants to eat less or practice eating to 80% fullness. There were 4 wantons which was decent as some places would only give 2-3 wantons when you ordered a mix. The beef brisket could be more tender but it was not bad. The noodles were thin and chewy (Hong Kong style) and the soup was a tad too salty for me. The chili was strange, I would prefer the type served at Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure. I guessed the people has spoken. The noodle did not live up to its hype so there was no queue after 3 months of opening. It was still only half filled close to 12pm.",

    "text": "Adds a little spring to your step. I have to be honest here. I haven't been to Hong Kong in the last 20 years so it's very difficult for me to asses Mak's Noodles authenticity versus their Hong Kong counterpart.What I will do however, is compare it to other wanton noodles found in Singapore, based on either similar style or price range (so yes, no comparing to auntie lim or auntie choo's wanton Mee at xxx Coffee shop). Tossed Noodle with Shrimp Roe and Oyster Sauce. One of their signature dishes here, I found it leaning to the slightly saltier side. While the noodle was beautifully springy or \"Q Q\", the shrimp roe did end up making the dish a tad bit too smart for my liking. Braised Beef Tendon and Brisket Noodle Now this was a dish that I liked... A LOT!While still leaning slightly towards the salty side, the sauce added a great additional depth to the noodles. Coating the noodles with a smooth, rich and really beefy sauce (be warned, it is really really beefy), served with a fairly generous portion of brisket and tendon, this dish will make any meat lover happy! Wanton soupHow could we come to Mak's and not try their signature wantons. First impressions? A generously stuffed wanton!Nothing can be worse than a wonton with really thick skin and minimum ingredients and this wanton is not one of them. Smooth skinned with a really juicy filling, the wanton was a delight to have! Overall..... A very decent wanton restaurant. The noodles are a lot finer to what most people are used to and because of its springiness, might irritate diners by getting caught between the teeth (I should know, I got a few stuck throughout my lunch), but, however, it was still a good Plate of wanton noodles. Queues are managed well and staff are generally friendly. That said.... Is it a Michelin star restaurant? Hmmm maybe the Hong Kong one but certainly not the ones in Singapore and, it is slightly on the higher end of the spectrum when compared to competitors like crystal jade etc, but it's still generally a decent bowl of wanton Mee.",

    "text": "Come here hungry, leave here hungry. Tiny bowls / portions of noodles that will do nothing other than leave you feeling thirsty and probably a little ripped off. When my bowl of brisket and tendon soup noodles arrived, I literally asked the waitress \"where's the rest of it?\"The bowl was only slightly larger than a rice bowl, and came with about 4 small pieces of brisket and 2 chunks of tendon. \u00a0The wonton and brisket noodle soup was only slightly larger, but that was probably just down to wontons requiring more room. Broth was tasty, and noodles were well cooked and springy, but had a very strong lye water flavour that I dislike. The wontons also had a very strong ammonia flavour, which I assume is either to preserve the shrimp or to give it some texture. Either way...It didn't taste good and I'm sure it can't be good for you. Go over to OC and have some wonton noodles at HK Central restaurant instead (Level 3, not the one opposite Smoothie King).",

    "text": "Heard about this newly opened restaurant through social media and word of mouth from both family and friends. My aunt was in the queue and when my mother and I arrived, we were quickly seated. I noticed that behind us there was a number of people queuing and looking at the menu before stepping inside this considerably not so big open concept restaurant.As most people have commented about the wonton noodle, I decided to get myself a dry version of the wonton noodle and luo han guo for beverage.The dishes were whipped out within 5 minutes. Unlike what my mother had commented, the portion was pretty reasonable (not too small). The noodles were stringy and on the side there was oyster sauce that you suppose to stir together with the noodles to increase the flavors. I tried the noodle first. Unlike another store I tried this week, it was pretty well cooked. It wasn't too soft or too hard to chew. The prawn wontons together with the soup were flavorful. Not as salty as I thought it might be.The Luo Han Guo drink was refreshing but I would probably try the other drinks the next time round. Price definitely was a little steeper when compared to hawker centres but the quality is what made people queue. Overall, it was a good experience dining here. Side note - take note of the lunch/dinner crowds.",
