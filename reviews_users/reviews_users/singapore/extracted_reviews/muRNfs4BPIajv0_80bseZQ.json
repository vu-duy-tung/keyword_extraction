    "text": "Was searching for cafe with airconditioning in Katong and this was one of those that came up. Great ambience, good coffee, delicious waffles, fabulous airconditioning. Came across their shop name in some coffee/food guide online and realized this was a branch of the original shop in Duxton. It's located in a relatively new Hotel cum tiny Mall. Katong area is known for its tough/painful parking experience. Was really surprised to find many parking lots in the mall/hotel outdoor parking. Major plus point. Another mall slightly further up, 112 Katong, parking is a complete pain. Ordered a Latte, Mocha, Almond Roasted Latte, Orange Juice and two waffles for about $50. Pretty pricey but definitely not a deterrence to many. The shop was running full for the two hours that we were there. The coffee were fragrant and absolutely delicious, the strength of coffee and balance of milk is awesome. The waffles were really good too.Would definitely recommend this place for all the factors (coffee, food, aircon, parking). One star short for the high price tag.",

    "text": "This is my favourite cafe! No qualms about this. It is so underrated. They sell food with a heart. It is moderately priced but the portions are good. Non pretentious and honestly tasty food. I love the handmade granola bowl and warm oats with fresh fruits. I was also once addicted to their bacon aglio olio. The caramel cappucino and roasted almond latte literally soothe your soul. The Katong branch is rather quiet during weekday evenings and exceptionally crowded on weekends. But this place is an AWESOME gem.",

    "text": "The eastern branch of their original outlet at Duxton, this outlet does not disappoint. Generous portions, great breads and I do love a good homemade hollandaise sauce. They are also very accommodating in customizing my orders, which is great.Love their coffees too, which is rich, robust and full-bodied. None of that tannic aftertaste. On lucky days, you may also get homemade yummy baked goods from the owner's mum secret recipe. The only thing gripe I have about this place is that it is located within a mall, which takes away a lot of its personality, unlike its sister outlet at Duxton. You'll be surprised how busy it gets with the expat crowd who lives in the east every morning, even on weekdays.",

Well kinda... it's not EXACTLY the same, but Katong's just down the road, right? This new spot in a spiffy new mall, and it's not the most obvious, but it seems like that how cafes like it now... if you're coming in by East Coast Road/\"The Roxy Square Side*\", then you'll want to walk the the other end of NTUC Finest. If you're coming in from Marine Parade/\"The Parkway Parade Side*\", then you're looking to go one level down from the street. It's a decent 40-ish seater spot, so you're all right to come by unannounced... for a while, before it's discovered by the hoards.They've got a more generous menu akin to the mothership in Duxton, so that's a welcome upgrade from RG. I got some Crispy Corn Croquettes with my capp this morning, and that made for a fun snack. The croquettes come with a deadly Japanese sesame salad dressing as a dipping sauce - I'm a mad sucker for that stuff, so I gobbled it all up.Lots of expats here too (it's Katong lah) so it makes for a cool people-watching spot as you pretend to tap away at your keyboard!",

    "text": "The cafe smelled amazing. All you could smell walking into the cafe was truffle oil. Me - truffle fan - was overjoyed. The menu was pretty enticing too. Lots of great brunch choices. The sour-faced cashier took our order not too willingly. Coffee we got were flat whites. Can't go wrong with them. They were made pretty well except that it was served in a cup slightly bigger than an expresso cup. Size wise, disappointing for the $5 price tag. The food arrived pretty soon after. I had the croque madame, a sunny side up on top of two dry and thick pieces of bread with ham bacon and a measly amount of cheese. This is not how you do a croque Madame. No way. The cheese was pathetic, they were so stingy with it that it didn't even ooze out. Usually a croque Madame would have some b\u00e9chamel sauce and cheese melted on it. Nope. This was dry, tasteless and not worth $16. The sarnies I make (and I don't cook much) are way better. Really not cool to disappoint someone who wanted great brunch. My friend had the poached eggs with smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce. The sauce was not too bad but the eggs were overcooked. No runny egg yolks oozing out when you cut them. Well, isn't the runnier texture the point of poached eggs? We got the chicken wings too. These were just battered wings that were deep fried without any seasoning. It was a what the... moment when we bit into the chicken. Unforgivable. My take: if you want to be a coffee joint, then stick to it. Don't offer food you don't know or can't make well. The coffee here, yes. The food, never again. The cashier could do with a smile on her face too.",

The food was excellent, the service fast and the place is very family friendly (we travel with two little ones). We both had the poached eggs and everything about them was very good - the salmon and hollandaise were both really tasty. I really appreciated the service as well - they were very happy to split an orange juice for our kids, brought an extra plate for them to split a waffle without us asking and said hello to them every time they walked by to deliver food. There were several families out for breakfast with wee ones and it is obvious they don't mind catering to a family clientele. \u00a0We will definitely go back! \u00a0Looked like a fun place to grab dinner or a glass of wine in the evening too.",
