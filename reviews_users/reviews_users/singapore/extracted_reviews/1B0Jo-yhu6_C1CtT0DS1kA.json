    "text": "Who could resist the aroma of a freshly bake dough coming out from the oven and not getting hold of them? The sight of it was enough to make me hyperventilate, let alone tasting one.It as probably 6-months ago since I last had my bun from Maison Kayser at Scotts Square. They have never failed to draw crowds despite the fact that they are anchoring at the basement of a smaller but prestigious mall. Prior to its opening last December, it was one of the most anticipated bakery by many eager Singaporeans. I admitted being one - so sheepish.Their butter croissant has always be a big draw. As they baked in batches to allow the bread to taste its best (given the high humidity level in Singapore, the crust gets softened pretty fast), luck plays a big part in determining if I manage to bring one home today. It was far better than striking lottery, to me.Today, I am not in my lady luck - I missed the batch of croissants. The fella who has gotten the last piece, must be gloating now. Not feeling worst, I have still have other consolations to pick from.Recalling what I had on my last two visits, I chose an array of sweet bread which tasted almost new to me.Pain Aux Pommes - The bun had a very faint sweetness arising from the honey. Its shell was undeniably crusty with a chewy dough. It was visibly filled with large apple chunks, stodgy and a tad sour. The walnut adds a good nutty flavor to the rustic bun.The Orange - Not sure if I read the tag correctly at the counter, \"earl grey with orange peels\". I sniffed none of the earl grey scent but the bread was baked using dark rye flour - nutty and doughy. I have always been attracted to chewy European-styled bread; this was the show stopper among all, which I bagged today. Generous amount of orange peels were seen everywhere, candied but still contained its natural citrus flavor. Marvelous!Pain Aux Yuzu - Didn't know that I had this yuzu bun until I read my previous blog! So this was my second attempt? And it had the same consistency! I adored the crumble yet the center was soft. The sweetness in the dough was prominent but natural. The yuzu peels were seen scattered evenly which gave a good lemony taste. I am still loving it.",

    "text": "A better than average bakery in the basement? \u00a0Yes! \u00a0Despite the German sounding name, Maison Kayser is from Japan and their products fill a nice niche that is richer than local bakers yet lighter than traditional European bakeries. \u00a0After reading the other reviews, I really should have gotten a baguette. \u00a0But I was able to try some croissants, eclairs, and cakes so I can definitely comment on those ;). \u00a0Their almond croissant was excellent. \u00a0Really. \u00a0Not sure if I like theirs over Paul's but in any case, it's damn good. \u00a0I wish I could say the same about the cakes. \u00a0Most were ok, but nothing really stood out. \u00a0However, their best seller, the lemon tart, is excellent. \u00a0Great flavor and a lovely tart altogether. \u00a0The yuzu eclair however, was a fail. \u00a0Overall, a very nice choice for bakery in an unlikely place.",

Although because of the weather you tend to lose the crispiness quite quickly. \u00a0Advise: put it in the over a few minutes before eating if it stayed out a few hours.We had a croque monsieur, mushroom soup and hand and cheese sandwich.Everything was quite good, very simple but good.Ham and cheese may not appeal to the asian crownd as the baguette bred is quite crispy and hard on the outside but it is authentic.",

    "text": "We had lunch here on a Sunday. This is the second time we have been for a Sunday lunch and have not experienced the queues mentioned in other reviews of this place. So the good news first. The food is very good. The menu is fairly simple but non the worse for it. Soups have been very tasty with the bread basket with six different kinds of bread. Not sure if the breads with fruit in go so well with soup but they are nonetheless very tasty. The jambon and fromage baguette was very good. Not too much mustard and the cheese and the ham both had good flavour. Apart from running out of Coke while we were there the flavored teas Nd coffee also lived up to expectations. Now the not so good. Simply put the service is poor. It is certainly not for the lack of staff with 3 to 4 people serving a relatively small number of tables excluding the staff behind the counter. However no one takes responsibility for set tables with the result that no one is responsible for your food and drinks coming out quickly. Our drinks finally arrived just as the food was finished. The staff need to take responsibility for set tables otherwise nothing will improve. As mentioned accurately in another review. They should change to self service and save on the staff costs. It really is a shame as the food and drink make this a worthy stop.",

    "text": "The best bakery in Singapore hands down. I've been waiting for Maison Kayser to enter Singapore ever since I read about it in a manga. Without a doubt, the main attraction is the buttery smooth crossiant that makes just having one only impossible. Snaking queues are a common sight in the day so the best time to go and try it would be in the evening, as I found out when I visited. Service is brisk and the staff are well-informed on the various types of bread on offer and can advice you on just what you require. Pricewise, I was pretty amazed that for such high quality breads, what you're paying for is downright cheap and inexpensive. They have a small cafe where you can dine in and have coffee as well. Being in the basement does cost the cafe a little bit of the allure of a glamourous bakery, but the bread more than makes up for it.",
