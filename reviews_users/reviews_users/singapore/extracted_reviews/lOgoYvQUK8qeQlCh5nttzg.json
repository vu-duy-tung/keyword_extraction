Not a very big fan , however it is one of the only cheaper options within MBS.The one thing I tend to eat here is from the \"Jia Xiang Kolo Mee\" store. I always order the fried fish fillet mee - satisfying fragrant bouncy noodles topped with two large pieces of battered fish. That being said, the fish soup is very mediocre - stock is watery, noodles tasteless and the vegetables bitter ... don't eat it unless it's the only store that is still open.Another highlight from my visits. People manning the dessert / drinks stall are really rude... I ordered a cheng tng and forgot to tell them to take-away . It wasn't very crowded and when I tried to tell them to make it take-away, they started kicking up this big fuss and bitching about me to my face. Wow. Service A+ man. Oh yeah, and the cheng tng sucked anyway.",

    "text": "Here's a fun fact that few people know about: Rasapura is run by food court chain Koufu!I expected this food court to be jaw-droppingly expensive when I first visited, but it's actually not so bad. Granted, S$6.90 for a plate of char kway teow isn't exactly cheap, but for a fancy place in a fancy area, it's cheap in comparison. I was expecting nothing less than S$10, truth be told, and I'm glad that's not so.On to the food: you can find all the standard good court here: local stuff, Indian food, Malay food, Italian food, Jap food, and more. There's a sizeable dim sum stall, and I like selection over at the fruits and juices stall. The char kway teow I had was oily, but pretty good. Same goes for the Hokkien prawn noodles. The good in general is good, and the place not a shabby choice to dine in if you're looking for something more affordable in the area.There are lots of seats, which is great. I've always managed to find a seat in less than 10 minutes no matter how crowded it was. If it's more crowded than usual, you can grab some of the standing tables and get burn some fat as you pile on some more!",

    "text": "The Rasapura Masters food court is actually a quite nice food court despite the overall low ratings by some of the reviewers. It has most of the popular local (Singaporean/Malaysian) dishes. \u00a0Here's my personal rating for this place.Convenient: \u00a0It's super convenient for those who stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, which is awesome by the way. \u00a0About 3/5 stalls open 24 hours, so it's about the only place where you can get good food at wee hours. Vendor stalls: \u00a0There're 20 or so stalls so it will be quite hard for one not to be able to find something he/she likes. \u00a0But do keep in mind that this is mostly local type food, not Western type food so don't expect to find hamburger, fries, pasta, pizza, Steak, etc. here. \u00a0Service quality is mixed as some stalls have great customer service and some are pretty rude (like the ladies in the coffee/drink/deserts stalls)Quality of taste: \u00a0Though they're not the best when it comes to having the best dishes when compare to venders at some of the other hawker centers but the dishes here are not bad at all. \u00a0Some is not good but most are quite good and authentic. Quality of food is very good in terms of cleanliness with the exception of the HAKKA YONG TAU FOO stalk as both my mom and my wife got a bad case of diarrhea almost immediately after have a bowl of their noodle soup, on different days so I HIGHLY DON'T RECOMMEND this vendor.Cleanliness: \u00a0This place is super clean with very nice Marble tables and chairs. \u00a0There're Servicers' who come by often to clean up dirty dishes from tables. \u00a0This is about the only food court you'll find that doesn't have sticky tables. \u00a0But do bring your own napkins as they don't provide them. \u00a0In fact, most food courts and hawker centers do not provide napkins. Prices: \u00a0For the kind of food they serve, they're about 15-20% higher than any hawker centers throughout so they're not cheap. But given many of the benefits I noted above, 24 hr access, clean food, clean place, and convenient, \u00a0it is well worth it IMHO. \u00a0Beats having to hop on the MRT to hawker centers just to crave your hunger, especially late in the day. Overall, I recommend Rasapura Masters food court to those who stays or hang around the Marina Bay Sands hotel for its good food and convenience. \u00a0I would have given this a 5 stars but due to the bad experience of the HAKKA YONG TAU FOO vendor noted above, I gave this a 4 Star.",

I never took note of the names of the food stalls we grabbed food from, but food was good. \u00a0I got three pieces of a meat dumpling wrapped around a million times with crispy stuff. \u00a0My description is so bizarre but if you take a look at the picture, you'll know what I mean! \u00a0This was pretty good, made nicely, would have tasted better with hot sauce. \u00a0My partner got a couple plates from, I think, a Singaporean food stall. \u00a0He got popiah (wrap) and kueh pie tee (crispy cup). \u00a0Both were good as well. \u00a0Did not blast us with flavour but was a nice snack not leaving you feel too heavy. Not much to say about service as it's a food court, but tables and area were super clean and not that busy when we went during the off-hour. \u00a0Not a HUGE food court but you will likely find something to your tastes :)",

    "text": "I always like to check out food courts in foreign countries. In my opinion, this is much higher quality than your typical food court fare. I actually ate there twice, as the selections were good, the prices reasonable, and the location at the bottom level of marina bay sands mall, convenient. I had chicken and rice that was really really good..my wife had fish soup that she thought was too \"fishy\" but once she added some spices it was better. I thought the iced coffee and iced milk tea at one of the stalls was amazing and helped overcome the jet lag blues. We didn't test it out but a few of the stands are supposed to be open 24 hours which would be nice when your mental clock wakes you up at 3am.",

    "text": "BS this place, fkn rip off the old lady. I came to the counter to order and quickly she came and ask what I want to eat. I asked for the two piece deep Fried charsui set (one order) and one piece deep fried shrimp. She quickly pulled two sets of charsui order and one three piece deep fried shrimp set PLUS and extra piece. This totaled me 11.50 rather than spending $6 something. I asked only wanted one order each, but got ignored and wanted to quickly charge my food. Had no choice I guess since it was already in my face and the cashier ringed the price. Seems like they like rip off tourist. I see locals here ordering food and I didn't see that old lady rushing towards them and up selling them. Eff you for the wonderful first time experience in visiting Singapore.",

    "text": "This is a really expensive food court. It is a glorified version of food republic in terms of price but with lackluster food. Even Glutton's Bay, a 15 min walk from here, offers much tastier delights at lower prices. Of course, there are some decent selections if you have eaten here often enough to know what to look for but for most, it is more likely to be a miss than a hit.What you are really paying for is the convenience and comfort of dining in an air-conditioned setting at a casino. While there will always be people raving about this place (it is arguably a good place for price insensitive tourists to enjoy a wide variety of Singapore food), locals should definitely look elsewhere.Overhyped and overpriced. Not shiok at all lor.",

    "text": "Okay, so firstly, I hate mall food. Gross! Sick! Maybe I'm just conditioned to dislike foods that's served in malls in America. So sue me! (McDonald's, Panda Express, chik-fil-a, the list goes on BARF!) Anyhow, we headed over to the shopping mall because we couldn't check into our hotel. Hungry, tired from traveling 24 hours, \u00a0and with time to kill, we stumbled upon this \"fancy\" (fancy for a food court) food court. This was truly a gem. This is not a separate food court stall section, this food court is all owned by the same company. With so many options as far as delectables went. They had dim sum, peaking duck, suckling big, fried rices, noodles, chicken and rice, juices, you name it they probably had it. We decided to go with a variety of dim sum, 3 shrimp har gow, 3 chicken and scallion dumping, 3 pork buns, and 3 sesame peanut balls (1 order is a serving of 3, you must pay for 3) . Loved every last bit of it!! Best of all it costed us around $10 US dollars total! We were definitely full, and was more than enough. We actually loved this place so much we came back, after we tried a bit more pricy dim sum place in the mall, and it still wasn't as good as our cheap food court dim sum. Actually, we ate as KU D\u00c8 T\u00c0, because we felt the need to treat ourselves to a nice dinner, and it honestly still wasn't as good as here and the hawker centre. (NOTE: just go for the cheap food in Singapore, you're not missing out on anything!!!!!)",
