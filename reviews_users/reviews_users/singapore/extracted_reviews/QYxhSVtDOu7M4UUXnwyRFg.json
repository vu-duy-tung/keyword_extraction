    "text": "Located at the basement of Liang Court, I had no idea about this place thanks to a friend who came back from Okinawa not too long ago and recommend us to give it a try. We were fortunate as we got the last place just outside of the restaurant. Looking at the menu, the presentation of it is poor. I always believe in having presentable menus to let the customers look forward to enjoy what they have ordered. Service was slow as they were short handed. It took a while for them to come over but fortunately \u00a0the food didn't take long to come. Looking at the photos can be misleading and for this case I was a little shock because I felt the portion was small but at least the steak (I had the beef steak) was cut for me. Eating everything up - the quality of it was quite decent but I didn't feel full. This was my first experience with Okinawa's food and I hope to try it again the next time I return. Price of the food is around $20 + per person, a little bit expensive but for the experience, I think it's worth a try. Overall, it's a decent Japanese restaurant.",

    "text": "Four stars but still lacking the magic to make it five - regardless this is already one of my favourite restaurants visited during this trip to Singapore. Also, it also made it into my list of Japanese restaurants that I'd always remember - the ambience makes you feel like you're in Japan and the food are really good too!Only thing that pulls you back? - the long waiting once it's slightly pass dinner hours, and just so that you know you would have to wait for more than one hour for weekends.But I assure you that the waiting is worth the food that you're getting. Really authentic dishes and fresh sashimi that they are serving here. Menu isn't as extensive as you would expect it to be, but I was satisfied with the cube steak, rice ball and baked salmon with mushrooms that I have ordered. For the quality of food, their price is pretty fair too.The rice balls were served so warm and nice, it literally put a smile on my face, \u00a0and you're given different filling choices of salmon, cod roe and ume. Pick what you like!They serve really refreshing Orion beer here too! I ordered it and it went really well with the grilled beef that I've ordered - literal satisfaction. Check the place out for yourself!",

Arrived at 9.48pm and was told by staff that they've stopped last orders for the day. Chef has changed recently as well and the dishes I normally order have dropped in standard. The fried seaweed dish has turned into an overly doughy mess.",

One of the highlights for me was the peanut tofu - imagine a supersmooth peanut butter, chilled down and moulded into a little block of tofu. It looked almost like pudding! And it was AMAZING. Delicate silken texture, and that peanut flavour. YUM.",

    "text": "Come here to treat yourself to an authentic and unique Okinawan meal at Nirai Kanai. Located in the basement of Liang Court, a place frequented by many Japanese expatriates, it has \u00a0predominantly japanese clientele base. There is also a large variety of sake to choose from, and they serve Orion beer to help wash everything down.Wide selection of many dishes, but pork features heavily. The salads are very fresh and crisp, and were perfect for countering the heavier dishes we ordered. We had a lot of pork dishes, and they were all great, but my absolute favourite was the braised pork. It comes in thick slices, sitting in sauce. You can see the layers of meat and fat - the meat is tender and delicious, but the amazing fat is actually very light and melts in your mouth. Sublime!I also found the caviar seaweed a delightful oddity for my senses. It's salty and fresh, and when you chew it up, the little balls growing as part of the seaweed pop in your mouth, They have the same texture as fish eggs!Okinawan food is actually very different from your usual Japanese fare. Do take the time to explore the menu and try new things! They have sashimi as well, and it was fairly fresh and alright tasting, but nothing special compared to the other dishes. Great ambience inside the restaurant. It's dimly lit had lots of woods and panels in between the tables, providing an intimate setting for your dinner. I didn't feel like I was in Singapore. Waitresses were very friendly and attentive as well, always coming by to check on our table and making sure we had our tea and sake constantly replenished!Food here is reasonably priced, and I would say a meal here would cost you about $50 and above per pax, depending on what you order. However, it's well worth the quality. If price is an issue for you, drop by during lunch as they have affordable set lunches for the working crowd. I thoroughly enjoyed eating here with my Japanese friends. And I'm so glad they did all the ordering. :)Make sure you call and make a booking beforehand, as this place is very popular and the tables are always filled when I come in the evenings for dinner.",

This silken beancurd, but now made with peanut. Oh yes, it. Is rich, nutty and really smooth all together! The Okinawan noodles are sensational too. Refreshing from the usual ramen that Friends around me rave about endlessly. The stock is lighter and sweet, not as rich as your pork bone soup stock of kyushu ramen which i usually eat.They still have the usual japanese dishes, but try the okinawan alternative. Inam more than glad to have traded my white rice for the okinawan steam rice! Delish!",

The first time, I was charmed by the cuteness of the decor, the extensive japanese menu and the variety of dishes they had to offer. Everything was so home-style, okinawan style. We had the bittergourd with egg which was pretty yummy, and the mentaiko (cod roe) onigiri blew my mind. It was like if you were born to Japanese parents, and they packed it in your lunch box and you feel euphoric when you bite into it on a cold winter day. I loved it. So I went back for more, this time, trying the silkgourd with tofu and pork and it was frigging amazing. The sauce was so good I slurped the whole thing down (incredible with rice), full of rice wine and sweetness of the silkgourd. The mackerel with eggplant was pretty good as well. Paired with a couple of Orion beers, this place is pure home-style heaven for me. Yum!",

Perhaps it was wrong of me to be \u00a0expecting it to be similar to what we are more accustom to i.e. sushi, sashimi, etc. Okinawan food is greener and healthier so it may suit the health conscious better. Service was alright, ambiance was cozy but would call it comfortable. I'll give this place a pass.",
