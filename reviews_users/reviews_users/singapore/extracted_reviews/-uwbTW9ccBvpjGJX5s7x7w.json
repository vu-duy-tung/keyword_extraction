    "text": "I brought a friend to Clifford Pier for their Sunday brunch buffet. It was SGD52 per person and offered a wide variety of local foods. It was a great way for my friend to taste a mix of all the local foods in a beautiful historical setting. There was Chicken Rice, Satay, Kway Teow, dim sum, congee, sushi, rojak, laksa, chilli crab and other delicacies. Each dish is clearly labeled (especially with ingredients so if you have any food allergies you can avoid them). They also served local desserts and ice cream. Of course you could find better quality food at specific hawker locations or restaurants, but if you dont have time to hit various locations, this was a central location allowing my friend to have small samples and go in for repeats. The buffet also doesnt have a time limit, so we were there from 11:30am till 2:30pm (when they close). I am not sure how the a la carte menu is priced, but I would go for their buffet selection based on price and quality. Worth the visit and surely a place I will bring future guests who are on a short stop and never had any of the local flavors!",

It's a gorgeous restaurant in a gorgeous hotel, with an even more gorgeous view, so when The Clifford Pier promoted that they were having a Peranakan Cuisine showcase by guest Chef Philip Chia, I knew we had to give it a try. The menu isn't extensive, just the highlights of Peranakan Food like Ayam Buah Keluak, Babi Pongteh and Nonya Chap Chye but with all the essentials there, it was enough for us to give it a shot. Ayam Buah Keluak ($28) The benchmark of any Peranakan Reataurant has to be the Ayam Buah Keluak. You can usually determine how good or bad your dinner is going to be from the way this dish was prepared and it was no different here. The sauce was very fragrant and very good. Lighter and slightly more watery than those I'm used to, it still had distinctive taste from the Rempah (spice blend) with a hint of the Buah Keluak. The Buah Keluak itself was something special. We're used to having it either as it is, or with the \"meat\" dug out , mixed with minced pork and stuffed back in but this one was special. They dug it out, mixed with with the rempah before stuffing it back in the shell. This made the Buah Keluak meat very flavorful and less pungent, which is good for beginners. Only thing is the way they cracked the shell. We usually open it down the side but because the opened it at the top and made it a pretty small opening (smaller than the teaspoon give), it made it very difficult to dig out the filling with a knife. The let down though was the chicken. They gave three chunky pieces of thigh yet every piece was cooked till it was dry and tough. Very very disappointing. Babi Pongteh ($28)Another easily recognizable Peranakan dish, the Babi Pongteh is a wonderful stewed pork dish with a bean paste. The flavours again was very nice. The sauce was fragrant and wonderfully thickened by the fat from the pork belly. It is a bit sweeter that the Pongtehs that I'm used too but it wasn't by any means overpowering. The problem again was the cook of the meat. While the fat was wonderfully melt in your mouth and the meat around the fat was tender and juice, it got extremely dry and tough as you reached the bottom. Another case of overcooked protein. Nonya Chap Chye ($18)Probably Peranakans most well-know vegetable dish, a Nonya chap Chye is more than just putting vegetable together and boiling it in a pot. There's a lot of care that goes into it with each vegetables different cook time. The key to any Chap Chye is ensuring the sweetness of the cabbage shine yet allowing strong flavors of the fermented soya bean and dried Beancurd skin to come come through. Too much or little of either and it'll lose the balance of the dish. The version served here is easier on the palette for those who do not like the taste of beancurd skin or fermented bean paste. It's naturally sweet \u00a0 With that hint of saltiness from the bean paste, however, I hate to eat it again and again but.......... It was overcooked!The cabbage was mushy, the carrots were so soft I could mash it with my tongue and even the black fungus, that normally offers a nice crunch to the otherwise soft texture, was cooked till I could break it apart without biting. Lemon Barely ($5)This had to be the most natural tasting lemon barleys I've ever had. No artificial, cordial lemon barely here. It was straight up boiled barley drink (yes with the cooked barley in the glass), rock melon and lemon juice. A good way to counter the richness and spiciness of the Peranakan dishes. On a whole, the dining experience was decent but certainly not 5 star quality. The ongoing trend here was that, while the flavors were good, the main protein and veg were all over cooked. Chicken, pork, vege, all cooked way over than it should be. I understand the need to leave them in the flavor the dish but there's a ceiling and unfortunately, all the dishes here went way way way over it. Oh and unfortunately, service wasn't up to standard too. 1) servers were not strategically placed. It took a while to get someone's attention as all the wait staff were near the entrance while we were near the rear. 2) they were preparing for an event outside. I know there's a need to have background music but a. Did they really need to blast the music and fill hall with bass-y chill out longer music? Considering that the guest hadn't even arrive? b. To rectify the issue, they ended up turning up the ambient music in the restaurant! Not till it was deafening because we could still talk but to a point that it was above the comfort range. So overall: Venue: 5*Ambience: 3* (thanks to he music) Service: 3* Food: 3* I would love to give this experience a 4 but I'll wait till my next visit before determining.",

    "text": "There are two restaurants within Fullerton Bay Hotel, so make sure you go to the correct one. The other one is called Clifford Restaurant so look out!This place is a beautiful dining hall overlooking the MBS side, with nice chandeliers, big big vases of white orchids, and soft background music playing by a live band (for dinner). It is a very, very pleasant experience to dine here. Service here is impeccable, and waitstaff are attentive and prompt.Let's come to the important bit. The food.Cuisine here is Singaporean hawker food, served with an upmarket touch. The prices here are a steep mark-up from the usual hawker fare, so be prepared to shell out some heavy dough. I came here with a companion and we started with two popiah rolls (thin crepes stuffed with turnip, prawns, egg) ($12). I had the laksa with lobster ($36), which I enjoyed, apart from it not having cockles... My grouse was that my laksa was not Instagram-worthy, with bits of chopped lobster scattered in the laksa. Come on guys, for 36 bucks++ the laksa better look good.My companion had fried snapper with brinjal/eggplant. He rated it 6/10. You have to order rice separately, which is $5 extra, but you have a choice between white and brown rice, which is freeflow. Pretty sweet. I like the brown rice option. Plus point for having healthier choices!We ended the meal with a key lime pie for him, and an ice kacang for me.The key lime pie was good, and had a good digestive crust. They were very accommodating when I mentioned I didn't want peanuts and red beans inside my ice kacang. The ice kacang differs from the hawker one - the ice is very finely blended/ground, so that it is soft and is melt-in-the-mouth, unlike the crunchy feel from the hawker ice kacang. Our bill for two came up to 200 because we had two beers and a glass of champagne (they sell Perrier Jouet by the glass ehre ($30)). If you don't drink, I think this meal is still affordable - comparable to a normal restaurant meal.Would I come back? Maybe. Definitely not getting alcohol next time!",

    "text": "We went here on our transit stop in Singapore and enjoyed a lovely buffet full of delicious yumminess, before our flight to Frankfurt. The hotel has a giant dining area, as well as a lounging area right beside it. Both are equally large with very high ceilings and an exquisite atmosphere. From what I have heard, the full-on buffet is not a regular happening, but on this day, there was a celebration in town (we went at the end of May), which was the partial reason for the buffet. From antipasti, to seafood, to salads, skewers, traditional rice- and noodle dishes, glazed pork belly and more; they had EVERYTHING on the menu. We were very happy with our choices.The staff was equally helpful with allergy questions and very attentive, which is also a great bonus. Can only recommend.",

Flavors are somewhat authentic but skewed to western tastes. We had the key lime pie and rum baba for dessert. Avoid like the plague. It was terrible. It is somewhat better than your average coffee shop in ambiance and service. But with 3 star prices, it's a place to chill out for brunch or lunch in the weekend but ultimately not a value.",
