    "text": "I am a big fan of Cedele, so whenever possible, I make sure to pick up a sandwich or salad from the nearest Cedele for lunch or a quick pick-me-up in the afternoons. This particular Cedele in Novena Square is a little small and feels cramped. It's also along the route to the MRT station so there's always lots of traffic going by, making this place pretty noisy as well. I wouldn't recommend staying here for your meal, especially since it'll be hard to get a table in the first place, but the food is, as always, excellent, and it's totally worthwhile to grab something to take away.",

    "text": "Oh dear.My most recent visit here was an unfortunate reminder of why I don't come here in the first place. I was looking for something fast and healthy-ish, and needed a break from my usual lunch rotation. Looking at the menu, the pastrami sandwich caught my eye. I was pretty hungry, and thoughts of a nicely stacked pastrami slices for $8.50 seemed like a good idea.When my buzzer went off, I fought through a crowd of people waiting to be served, only to finally reach the counter and see a plate with a high-tea sized sandwich. Check out my picture. There were 2, at most 3 slices of pastrami. 3 out of 4 of the bread slices were a bit too toasted, and 1 slice wasn't even toasted at all. More evidence that my bread was no good? I had to use a sizable amount of force to bite through it, causing crumbs to fly to the nearby tables (which are pretty close together, by the way.) It was pretty painful, as by the end the roof of my mouth felt... abused. It was as if it were burned!As I struggled to get through the saddest sandwich in the world, I longingly looked at the Burger King opposite, wishing I went there instead. That's saying something, as I'm team McDonald's all the way!",

    "text": "For organic products, prices are kept considerably affordable at Cedele. I had tea at their branch in Novena Square yesterday with two friends. With so many interesting items on their menu, it was hard deciding what to get! In the end, we had some of their sweet breads, Raspberry Thumbprint and their vegetarian Mexican's Wedding cookies. While the Raspberry Thumbprint cookie was crummy and a bit of a letdown, the flavourful scones, buns and Mexican Wedding cookies were delightful.This branch is quiet, so we were seen to promptly and had no problems getting seats. The polite, patient staff and cosy ambience in the cafe enhanced the pleasure of the experience and we exited with happy bellies.",

    "text": "Being a vegetarian, I am not usually spoilt for choices in SG. However, cedele is one of the places which serves veggie sandwiches (which btw r seriously overrated!)this place isn't usually my first choice to have a good meal but i made an exception today (which I m deeply regretting).The quality of service and the attentiveness of the staff at the Novena Square 2 mall is simply appalling. I ordered a set menu consisting of a (veggie for me) sandwich, soup (veg again) and iced tea which they promptly WROTE down. Although the soup and tea were ready to serve but I was still made to wait and finally when my sandwich was ready I had to remind them that the rest of my order is nowhere to b seen.With great displeasure the guy at the counter quickly poured some brownish water (ice tea apparently!) and some soup all around the bowl.To my utter disgust I found out that the soup contained chicken pieces when one of the shredded pieces rolled around my tongue ( as a vegetarian there is nothing more Disgusting than that, trust me).I guess it was wrong on my part to assume that they got my order right which they had duly noted (may b it is just to get the charge right).I write this review with utter disgust and dismay and vowing to never go to this place ever again!",
