In a group, you can order their BIG intestine, yummy, goes well with a bowl of steam rice. Why 4 stars? It's too hot sometimes, suggest get a spot that the fans are blowing... & the salted egg mince meat is bit to tough.The chilli & dark sauce goes well with the Pig organ soup & rice.Bon appetite.",

    "text": "Was walking around during CNY \u521d\u4e09 and saw this opened, so decided to try the \u732a\u4ec0\u6c64 (Pork organ soup) with \u5364\u8089\u996d (Rice with braised pork belly) Food:Soup is decent. Not as peppery (I added pepper to suit my taste). There was some noticeable sweetness in the soup. However, the flavors weren't as strong as I expected (seeing that it's the \"pork rib king\")The meat (stomach, liver etc.) is quite nice, except for the lean meat which I felt was on the tough side. The \u5364\u8089 (braised meat) which came with the rice was cooked pretty well, it was tender and soft. And the gravy really complements the rice. Chilli goes pretty well with the meat too! Spicy enough to give a kick but not spicy to numb your tongue. Price:Honestly though, I think they are on the pricier side. The \u5364\u8089\u996d costs $2 per bowl, more than two times the price of a normal rice bowl (80 cents) but the amout of meat they gave leaves much to be desired.In addition, I ordered a large bowl of pig organ soup ($7), but I feel the amount of ingredients didn't feel like $7. But this could be due to the prime location of the place. (Well, they didn't have a CNY price increase, or at least I'm not aware of it, so that's nice) Ambience:I can't say much as I went during CNY so there was little people. But well, that's what piqued my interest as there was a considerable number of people eating in the shop knowing that it's CNY. Nevertheless, the shop interior was decorated with some rustic feel, but that was all. Overall:Unfortunately, I wouldn't say this is one of the best pig organ soup I've eaten. It's decent, but not \"wow\". It's a nice place to go to if you are hungry around the Jalan Besar area, but I won't travel here just to eat it, \u00a0as I would with other food. \u00a0If I eat here again, I'll update this review.",

Never came in either because I could not afford it (40 yrs ago as a student) or today, I never had the patience to wait for a table. \u00a0His sat morning I decided to venture here to try out. \u00a0 Verdict?I was disappointed with the taste. The soup was ok, mild. For those who likes it mild- it will suit your palate. The Hua Tiao chicken - was tasty, but not fresh (like been in the steamer overnight).They do not add gravy to your rice. Darn!Top up of soup was greeted with the usual reluctance from the cook. \u00a0And you have to bring it al the way to the cook (a little corner that's has a small window of access to the cooks hot pot of soup. Dangerous!Overall, I am ok with this. Not bad tasting. However I won't brave the wait or poor service to come back again. \u00a0 So where is a better place for pig organ soup?At serangoon gardens food center, there is one pig organs soup is still rated and #1 on my list. Got try it... Don't go during lunch time unless u don't mind queuing .... Still worth the queue! \u00a0The soup Kees u coming back for more (friendly service). Recommended low peak time: around 11am or after 2pm. Enjoy! ALex",

    "text": "The pig organ's soup has intestine, stomach, pork... literally everything but the oink! The salted veg helps cut down the fat and the soup has a lovely umami body to it. They will top up the soup for free, so good for the soup-erholics. The vinegar pork trotter was braised to tender gooey perfection, but it would've been better with more old ginger in the braising liquid to give it punch",

    "text": "Disappointing. Seen huge crowds here at lunch time so came here to tryout. A large soup that's $6 with veg on a dish and a small dish of chicken plus 2 rice bowls comes up to $13. Decent priced. However the soup is average and when we asked for gravy for the rice, we were told that we have to order the pig trotters then we'll get the gravy. When we needed more soup, we were told to get it ourselves. Unlike the usual Bak Kut Teh stalls that go around asking if you want more soup and served you at your tables. It makes sense to get customers get their own extra soup if they have company. What if I'm eating alone? That would be interesting to manage. \u00a0Anyway, this is the first time I didn't finish my soup for this kind of food. I usually lap all the soup up. So, not worth making a trip here again.",

They have created this place to look like an old school coffeshop for people to reminisce the good old days. This place sells one of the yummiest pig organ soup and they have pretty good side dishes to accompany the meals. You can choose ala carte or set meals. The set meals consist of a soup, a side dish and a drink. (excludes the pig trotter). \u00a0The side dishes they have are vinegar pig trotter, minced meat cake, sesame chicken, meicai and much more. The meat and innards are cook very tender and just nice. The portions are rather generous and very filling. Oh yes, the soup is free flow too.",
