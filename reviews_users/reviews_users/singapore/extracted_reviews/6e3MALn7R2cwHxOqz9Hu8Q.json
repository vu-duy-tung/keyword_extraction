    "text": "A delicious, old school Teochew joint! I came here with my parents yesterday around 530pm, and there were ~4-5 tables empty then. It filled up incredibly quickly and by the time we were leaving there was a short line. So come early! The food is delicious with a simple light taste. Definitely a little pricier- our bill came up to $70+ for 3, but that was also because we love vegetables and ordered 2 dishes, and we didn't eat much rice.*prawn paste chicken ($8) - this was still hot when it arrived and perfectly fried. The only thing is that the skin wasn't very crusty as some zichar places do it, and the 'prawn paste' taste wasn't very strong.*sliced fish with spring onions - yummy, classic dish!! A favorite.*sweet potato leaves with sambal- so delicious. I've tried many variations of this but this is spicy and fresh! *lotus root soup - the meat was falling off the bones but the lotus roots itself were kind of hard. The portion wasn't that large as well for 4 people. A decent choice if you're craving traditional soup. *bee hoon - we saw the table next to us ordering this, and decided to give it a shot. It has generous portions of meat and egg, but overall it was quite a small dish. (We also ordered another veggie dish that I didn't try!) They charge for water but not unreasonable - they charged 3 glasses as 1 portion of water. The place is also family run, and the waiters are all the owners - the two elderly women were so quick and efficient still!! One of the gems in the Joo Chiat area with home cooked comfort food.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to us by a friend and it did not disappoint. We had the Teochew grouper, sweet potato leaves with garlic, eggplant, pork ribs with bitter gourd and the prawn paste wings. Obviously, we over ordered however everything we had was absolutely delicious. The fish was nice and light and if you add the chillies and fish sauce then it gets even better. The pork dish was so yummy, the sauce was really good and the bitter gourd was cooked to perfection, we all fought over the last of the ribs! The wings were just nice, juicy and crispy with a very strong flavour of prawn(obvi). The eggplant was overkill for us and the one dish that we had the most leftover. It was still really good but kind of a heavier veggie side. Definitely recommend and am excited to go back.",

    "text": "A true local spot on Joo Chiat Road. The staff here mainly speak Chinese, so if you know a little, it helps!I'm pretty sure there are some solid dishes to be had here, but unfortunately I thought that the ones I sampled were just okay lah. We tried the silverfish omelette, which was pretty good but I found it a bit too salty. I also ordered the prawn paste chicken wings, which I found a bit dry and not that great, to be honest. Believe it or not, my benchmark for Har Cheong Gai (or is it Har Jeong Kai?) is the version served by the Everything With Fries chain*, and I still think EwF's is better.I also think this place has a bit of an identity crisis, as it appears to go by 2 different names- Joo Hing and Joo Heng. On the menus and the signage outside, it says \"Joo Heng\", but on the staff t-shirts, it says \"Joo Hing\". Not sure which one it is!Next time, I might ask someone who's has better Chinese tastebuds and reading/speaking skills to come with me and choose dishes on my behalf. It might be a better outcome!--*Do you think I need a better benchmark? If so, let me know where I should go for the best har cheong gai!!",

    "text": "I remember coming here not so long ago, when there was no air-con, and it was just one shophouse, and I remember thinking wow that's pretty big-time to have one full shophouse for a zi char.My last visit = mind blown. Two shophouses, fully air-conditioned, one side looking quite posh restaurant style (dark walls, high-backed chairs), the other... the original layout, plus air-con. Guess where I sat at?Original side lah! So nostalgic right? The walls are the same colour as before, the table layouts, and the chairs, and even the old sign at the back that lists their opening hours.Order all your favourites - they do so many things well here, but I must tell you about this one dish, simple as it may be, but AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. Yes, the chye poh omelette. It comes on a small orange plate, looks really flat, and a little charred (but its better that way), and seems super unassuming, but once you put a piece in your mouth, you'll know why I've put a whole paragraph into telling you about it. Simple,indescribable joy - from eggs and pickles.Go get some for yourself and see, just not on Mondays when they're closed!",

    "text": "A stalwart of the Joo Chiat neighbourhood, Joo Heng is a household name to the Easterners that's synonymous with homestyled cze char. It may not be particularly rave-worthy, but it's an old reliable that churns out familiar favourites at slightly upmarket prices. Personally, I thought the above-average pricing was justified; we were graciously treated with a good dose of warm friendly service not commonly felt in most cze char joints.We had:1) Claypot Chicken ($16): laden with baby corn, snow peas, carrots, cabbage, black mushrooms, and red peppers, the spicy undertones of the chilli peppers tempered the rich savoury overtones of the oyster sauce.2) Black Pepper Beef ($18): tender without the overt taste of artificial tenderizer. The punchy chilli-spiked black pepper sauce was contrasted with the sweet tartness of the shallots and fresh spring onions.3) Sambal Sweet Potato Leaves ($12): unctuous with copious lashings of belachan and dried shrimp bits.4) Beancurd with Prawns ($18): slathered in a gooey egg-drop gravy, sumptuous and a signature must-try",

    "text": "This traditional zi char house is so popular that tables spill out onto the walkway. While there are the typical zi char dishes like tapioca leaves, prawn paste chicken and other run of the mill items, the star of the show is undoubtedly the steamed fish head. And it's a pretty big head - I wonder what happens to the rest of the body? The fish is always very fresh and steamed to perfection, none of that slightly gummy mouthfeel one gets when seafood is a little off its prime. The head is smothered with a generous portion of fermented bean paste, topped with crispy lard and fat spring onions. And at sub $20, this is enough to feed two people who would willingly down the fish with just plain rice. Just sayin...Parking is terrible with all the narrow roads. Should you decide to drive, don't forget your coupons as the traffic wardens are especially vigilant here.",

    "text": "When I think Singapore comfort food, I think Joo Heng. It's a down to earth Singaporean family restaurant with kind hearted owners I went over here a few months ago to meet up with my Duke University classmates, one of whom lives in Singapore and the other visiting from Chicago. Least to say, the food was fantastic! I tried the deep fried shrimp roll, the famous steamed fish head, pork ribs, steamed baby squid and prawn tofu. To tell you honestly, I'm not the best person to comment about local cuisine as my local friends will have a more discerning taste, but this is clearly one of the best local spots I've tried in two years living on the red dot. I don't think Locals would strongly disagree with me. :-) Enjoy!",

Many of my relatives and friends have been visiting this restaurant for over 10 years!While the menu is limited, pretty much everything there is excellent! I personally enjoy the steamed tilapia fish with bean paste (everyone else is eating the fish head, but the tilapia is more tender and less bony, for the same price!), prawn paste chicken, sweet potato leaves in sambal and crab meat tofu. The restaurant's always crowded but i've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. Parking is convenient with a public carpark just opposite!Enjoy! :)",
