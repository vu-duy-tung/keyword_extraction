Good coffee and Hokkaido brioche, stuff like bacon, eggs and vegetables are pretty par for the course though. Oddly enough some of the baked pastries aren't as good as the rest of the food. Very friendly service. Hope to be back someday.",

Prices are very reasonable, and the coffee, breads, pancakes and dessert are fantastic. The sandwiches are decent but not outstanding.The flat white in particular is executed skillfully, with a roast that isn't too acidic, topped off with smooth, creamy microfoam.The wife enjoyed the sweet pepper vegetarian sandwich while my toddler who's been having a bad week cheerily gobbled down the classic scrambled eggs on toast (rye bread).The butterscotch & berries pancakes were soft and fluffy (get this!), and we couldn't get enough of the banana coconut bread pudding with gula melaka caramel and vanilla ice cream (get this too!)Give the cookies a miss though - they were dry (we prefer soft and gooey) and were a tad too sweet.",

    "text": "I love this place simply for the fact that they make their own bread! As you walk in on your right, you see massive glass doors that lead into the kitchen. They have huge mixer bowls and all sorts of fancy, commercial grade baking equipment.They sell their bread too, you can buy half a loaf for $4-5 or a whole loaf for $8.They have free wifi, water, and baking magazines to browse through. You order at the counter and for sandwich items, you pick them up at the collection counter when your buzzer rings. For breakfast platters and other non-sandwich items, the staff will serve the food to you. Everything on their menu is nett priced and sounds and looks delicious!1. Smoked Chicken Sandwich $8Sandwiched in a very crispy country bread, are smoked chicken slices, long beans, mustard and melted cheese. The exterior of the bread is almost biscuit like and it does take some jaw muscle to bite in. The chicken slices are breast meat sort of, with the mustard and gooey melted cheese. The chicken tasted so good! The smoked flavour wasn't very evident, mostly covered up by the mustard. The long beans provided as crunch in the sandwich as well as the \"green\" for the sandwich.",

    "text": "Wow this place is NOT good. Ive been using Yelp since 2010 especially when I moved to a new continent to help eliminate trial and error. It's not often that I get disappointed by highly rated yelp and this is one of them rare instances.We ordered the butterscotch & berries pancake and a Norwegian. The pancake was average and the Norwegian was a disappointment. For me salad (came w the Norwegian) isn't just a garnish, it's food. The cucumber was seeded (ok) and hard (not ok), the hollandaise sauce that came w the poached egg was not impressive (watery). The Hokkaido bread was quite ok. The smoked salmon was v average. The grilled asparagus on the other hand was really good. Unfortunately that's forms only 5-10% of the dish.The service was pretty good and people are Super friendly. Alight I'll bump them up to 3.",

    "text": "The coffee here is pretty legendary. Its gentle flavor with a hint of nuttiness swaddles your tongue in warm dulcet tones, leaving you wanting more. Its the kind of coffee you'd want to being home to meet your parents, and they wouldn't even ask all the normal embarrassing questions because its personality is just that charming. And then you'd get married, it'd be a simple wedding, with just a few guests, and you'd wake up every morning wondering what you did to deserve such a good coffee. And then you'll have kids, and it'd be the cutest little cappuccino ever, and your life will be perfect. And then one day, you'll wake up in horror to find that you've drunk your little cappucino, brown stains still around your mouth as they drag you away to jail, kicking and screaming about how it was just one sip.Oh and the bread pudding is pretty great too. More like that girl whos kind of cute with the funky hair that youd hang out with a few times but overall not too bad either.",

    "text": "The pancakes were an absolute delight! I don't typically enjoy pancakes because they tend to be too sweet for my liking, but I tried the maple syrup with bacon (forgot the name) and it was not too sweet and not too salty! The bacon was also one of best I've tried. The sandwich was pretty normal, but the pork belly sandwich was interesting - it's like a Chinese and western fusion. Pretty cool place, everyone working there seemed to be students, and I heard it's a relatively new place so many things were amateur eg paper plates and amateur waiters (we were asked to sit with a bunch of strangers on the same table before we hesitated and they gave us a table of our own). Not too expensive and the portion was alright.",

    "text": "5-stars for the price for value at Bread Yard. You can construct your own Egg's Benny for under $10 ($6 for poached eggs with Hollandaise sauce + $2-3 for either back bacon or smoked salmon). I would say the bacon is a better bet than the salmon--the latter was a bit salty the last time I had it. Sandwiches are also passable, while the mashed potatoes with gravy were delicious! Home-brewed iced team should be skipped.Seating is often easy to come by, but the space is small. Bread Yard is tucked away inside one north, but it's a comfy place on a Sunday morning or afternoon. Take a walk around to catch a glimpse of the architectural work of the late Zaha Hadid!",
