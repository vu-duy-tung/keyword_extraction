    "text": "Ugh I LOVE this place for lunch. Since returning from the US, where Korean food is surprisingly popular and extremely spicy and usually authentic, I've dragged numerous friend-groups to fulfil my Korean cravings (esp as the bf does not like spicy foods, so he's a work-in-progress). This place meets my criteria for good Korean food: 1) good banchan/side dishes. i.e. lethal kimchi, good variety, preferably includes jap chae but if not it's okay. none of those wilted, pathetic cabbages or musty tasting green veggies2) dense, rich, authentic soups with real SPICE 3) affordable, so there's none of that guilt from overspending on a single mealWe came here for lunch on a weekday, to find maybe 60% of the restaurant full? Pretty good considering the Telok Ayer idea is somehow oversaturated with various seemingly indistinguishable Korean eateries. The lunch menu ranged from $8-$20+, including free flow of quality side dishes. My friend ordered ginseng chicken soup - I didn't try, but it didn't include white rice since the server pointed out there was glutinous rice inside, which struck me as a little odd. My friend enjoyed it though. We shared the pork & ham spicy soup ($36 for 2-3 pax), which was really kimchi jigae, since it included pork, sausages, spam, some rice cakes, onions, fish cakes, and one serving of instant noodles. It came on a small stove and I just love the smell of bubbling hot soup. It wasn't really spicy though, and there were too many beans inside to thicken the soup. I wish there were more non-processed meats like porks, too. We also ordered a top-up of the soup for $3, which was yummy! The soup was decent and hit the spot, but I do also wish it had a meatier/richer taste besides just kimchi/spiciness. What I'm saying in a roundabout way is that it met the bar for a good kimchi jigae, but I wish it were a more complex dish. Such a great price though. Another important thing to note was that the servers were incredibly patient and quick. Since we (or more accurately, my friends) are college students/soon-to-be graduates that have yet to internalize the value of punctuality, my friend waited inside 20 minutes for two of us to arrive together, and then we waited another 5-10 minutes for our last friend before ordering. We never felt rushed throughout that, unlike how I've been treated at other restaurants when I'm the first to arrive. I'm already making plans to head there next week with another friend working around the Telok Ayer area, and foresee myself heading back there again, maybe for the bbq next time!",

    "text": "Omg!! A must go in Singapore. Delicious and tender meat, worth the price for sure!! We had the set A with 4 choices of meat plus mushrooms and we tried the rice balls too. It was all super fresh, big portion(really) and yumii and they offer starters with iced tea on the House. Friendly staff and we were very lucky to just walk in but make a reservation if you're more than two because it's super full at all times. Would go again for sure.",

    "text": "Very authentic korean BBQ with a charcoal grill so you don't get that gasoline smell. It usually gets pretty crowded and the AC doesn't work in some spots of the cramped restaurant, so dress light if you come here. The meats are fresh and well marinated, and they provide leaves and raw garlic to wrap your meats with. We ordered a variety of beef and chicken and everything was tender and delicious. They also pour beat up eggs down the ridges of the grill so you get to eat some soft fluffy egg if you're starving or waiting for the meat to cook. We also ordered a seafood pancake, which was gigantic and great for sharing. Their spicy soup was also very tasty.As a minor note, the tea tasted like water. It's kinda weird because it was tea colored so I expected it to taste like tea. But yeah it's free so whatever. Also wish they had more non-alcoholic beverages apart from sodas. Will definitely go again!!",

    "text": "I love Charcoal BBQ! Dae Bak was poppin on a Thursday night.We had the beef brisket (Chadol) and the Kalbi. A nice spread of banchans were refillable and the service was a bit slow at times however good enough with the awesome Korean buzzer that I have grown to love so much.The coolest part about Dae Bak? They have an awesome moat of steamed egg goodness that steams quickly on the grill while you wait for your delicious meat to be cooked. Genius idea!Reservations are highly recommended and if you are a party of 6 or more, request the private room but beware, you will come out smelling like a camp fire.",

    "text": "Charcoal grills? Check.Korean side dishes? Check.Good meat? Check.Dae Bak offers up some tasty dishes (the marinated beef was the best of the ones I tried), and has all the proper sides any self-respecting Korean establishment should have. As an added bonus, they also pour some egg into the pre-made form in the cast iron grill, which cooks up nicely as another snack. \u00a0It's as authentic as you get, and if you're in the area looking for some good Korean BBQ, look no further! That being said, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, there are other good Korean BBQ places as well in other areas.Prices are about $20 for a plate of meat. A plate is enough for one person. It's not a lot of food, but sufficient for one person (well, me at least).",
