    "text": "I'm pretty sure Chaun L. must be crazy. I've been to Wakanui three times and each time was delicious!There are two things that are a must on my list, 1. Ocean view steak (1 kg please!) 2. Lamb. I'm torn between these two red beauties. One bite of the lamb and I swear it's better than the steak. One bite of the steak, and I swear it's better than the lamb. I really can't make up my mind which was is better so you must order both! Here's the crazy part--the lamb is actually more lean than the beef! This is because Wakauni cures their beef for 40 days so all the meat stays nice, juicy, and fatty! Sounds a bit weird, but fatty steak is a good steak! And I'm talking about the good kind of fat here not the cheap kind found in a dingy Chinese restaurant. \u00a0A bit of meat and a bit of steak, simply heaven! The combo MELTS in your mouth. The sides are delicious as well and complements the meat. Mixed vegetables includes different kinds of charred veggies and the mushrooms are grilled with rosemary! For a good piece of meat, this place can't be beat. Some may even consider it to be cheap! I pay an average of $60-80 (depending on the bottle of wine) each time. Wakanui is the BEST place in Singapore for steak. The best. I'll see you there!",

I've been to Peter Lugers and Smith & Wollensky and can honestly say that Wakanui's 1,000 gram bone-in rib-eye can compare. This in itself is worth the price of admission. Dare I say that Wakanui has the Best Steak in Singapore. You Bet! Top it off with a New Zealand Pinot Noir and I promise you'll be in heaven.",

While the steak is delicious and we'll get to that in a bit, the lamb was possibly one of the best lamb dishes I've ever had. Flavourful, crisp, and succulent, I have dreams of that lamb, and they usually end with it being completely utterly devoured. The steak too is good, delivered as you want it, and tender and delicious. Beyond that? The potato puree was decent, the grilled vegetables, done as they should be.The Camembert on the cheese platter tasted like no Camembert I've ever had, and I mean that in as bad a way as possible. The New Zealand Kikorangi was excellent though, but the camembert was definitely a bad way to end the evening.",

    "text": "Ok, so upon my admission I did go to a steakhouse, and not eat steak, so use this review as you wish.I ordered 2 types of salmon starters, asparagus, eggplant and tomatoes sides and a whole seabass.The service was a bit slow, especially considering that we were seated on the second level and there were only 3 other tables whose meals were almost done with.The Veggies were ok. Nice, but nothing special The salmon starters were a bit too salty, and nothing fancy, and the seabass main was.....fresh. Nothing great, really.The dessert was a chocolate mousse that was essentially a huge kit kat Bar. That was nice! Not too sweet and not to chocolaty.Overall, I'm not impressed. It was average, but then again, I've been to some pretty spectacular steakhouses on a regular basis....and have eaten steak.As mentioned, our mains arrived around 45 minutes after our starters were served, after which my appetite died by then, so the overall experience was just average.",

The salmon carpaccio was served on a plate that was not wiped clean of oil. The taste was not memorable. The main was a 150g steak that did not look appetising, total absence of grill char. The potatoes that came with it were dry with a hint of bitterness. Strongly recommend anyone to not come here.",
