    "text": "This Cantonese restaurant in the basement of Sheraton Towers has been around for a long time, but it never feels dated and the food has been consistently excellent over the years.Li Bai is a family favourite for special occasions, and we have never been disappointed. The seafood pumpkin soup is one of our favourites as it is exquisite. They also make a beautiful peking duck, although I've never been a big fan of the duck noodles that follow - I just wish there was more of that delightfully crispy skin!The interiors are appropriately luxurious, and it's a rather small restaurant so it never gets overwhelmingly bustling. The staff is professional, many of them having worked in the restaurant for years, and they offer a highly personalised and affable service that is often missing in Chinese restaurants. Five stars because Li Bai is simply amazing on all fronts.",

Much nicer than the one at Jade Palace. The crispy parts of the rice was good.Ah Balling black sesame balls were good. Perfect texture.",

English speaking skills on the part of the staff could certainly be better and the restaurant was pretty cold in places but all in all it's a good place I went back there a second time during my visit and the results were about the same a good choice if you don't want to go out from the hotel.",

    "text": "Li Bai is well known for its wide range of Cantonese cuisine. I meant the restaurant located at the basement level of Sheraton Towers Singapore, not the famous Chinese poet. The cosy restaurant is popularly known for their dim sum but the other Cantonese dishes were stellar as well, which i found out after sampling some dishes from their Chinese New Year menu. Little appetizers were served and we couldn't stop snacking on the candied chestnuts with sesame seeds. The seasoned dried scallops with chili and dried shrimps had me ask for seconds (sans chili oil). I think there's some XO sauce added to it and it's certainly a good seasoning/accompaniment to the mains.Instead of the regular salmon yusheng, we had the Turbot fish, whose name in Chinese means 'many treasures'. There are fried taro and pumpkin slices in the mix, which gave the dish some added crunch.Next, the Braised Superior Bird's Nest with Crabmeat and Crab Roe. I was delighted to see that Li Bai uses birds' nest as a replacement for shark's fin. Well at least bird's nest can be sustainably farmed so it's the lesser of two evils. I liked the clean and light taste of the birds nest (Li Bai was extremely generous with the bird's nest), which was served with a copious amount of crab roe. Ask for the XO sauce, we heard from the PR girls that it's great with the soup. Next, the Lobster done two ways: Salted Egg Lobster and Saut\u00e9ed fillet of lobster with greens. Surprisingly, I preferred the saut\u00e9ed fillet even though anything served with salted egg is faultless. The sweetness of the crustacean could be tasted better with the ginger garlic sauce. The texture was superb as well, with the meat being springy instead of chewy. Stewed \"Eight Treasures\" Chicken with South African 5-head Abalone and Sea Cucumber is the perfect dish to be eaten with a bucket of fragrant steamed rice. Much effort has gone into the preparation of the chicken, which was first stuffed with chestnut, mushrooms, barley, lotus seed etc, then fried and browned, before stewing it for 2 hours to achieve that fall-off-the-bone quality. Abalone was briny sweet and tender too. We ended dinner with traditional Chinese desserts with a twist. This Pan-fried Nian Gao had coconut in it and was more like the Malay kueh. The Water Chestnut Cake hearts were a refreshing end to the dinner as well. Li Bai will be serving 9 reunion set menus that caters to various group sizes from 17 Jan to 24 Feb 2014. Do make a reservation in advance to prevent disappointment!Li Bai is certainly a Chinese restaurant that I will keep coming back to. Great service, environment and food. Mums will definitely love this one!",

    "text": "Li Bai is one of our go-to restaurants for classically conservative Cantonese fare that's exquisite and consistently flawless. Ditto for the personable service. Attentive without the intrusion, efficient without the stuffiness.We love:1) Roasted Pork & Barbecued Meat Combination ($36) comprising roasted duck, barbecued pork, and roasted pork, with a side of marinated jellyfish: Everything on this plate was luscious, flavourful to the bone, and absolutely scrumptious.2) Hot & Sour Soup ($12): a velvety concoction abundant with fresh scallops, prawns, sea cucumber, fish maw, and mushrooms 3) Wintermelon Thick Soup ($15): choc-a-bloc with sweet chunks of crabmeat, conpoy, silken beancurd, and egg drop.4) Baked Canadian Cod ($18 per portion): glazed with ophiopogon root and honey for a bitter-sweet contrast, and served with poached kailan and pinenuts for a little crunch.5) Chinese-Styled Pan-Fried Fillet Steak ($15 per portion): Imbued with a wonderful smoky char, and burnished with an oyster-based sauce, this was tender and juicy.6) Braised Spinach Beancurd ($20 per portion): silky and soft, drenched in an opulent conpoy-enoki gravy",
