    "text": "Best gyro in Singapore! \u00a0I've been searching and waiting for a good gyro or shawarma for the past few years, and Yeero Gyro finally delivers. \u00a0From the same folks behind Pistachio, they just recently opened Yeero Gyro in the same mall on the same floor. \u00a0I tried the chicken gyro and thoroughly enjoyed a pita full of succulent chunks of chicken, accompanied by lettuce, tomato, onions and lots of tzatziki sauce. \u00a0The flavor and quality really set this apart from other versions I have had in Singapore. \u00a0At $12, it's not exactly cheap but given the amount of meat and quality, it's definitely worth the price. \u00a0There are a few other items such as Greek fries and pizza on the menu, which I will also try.",

The only good thing from this restaurant is that the meat did have flavor to it. Over all I would not recommend coming back to this restaurant.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner.The food was above average for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine. However, that was pretty much the only good thing going for it.Price-wise, everything was pretty standard for restaurant fare. However, the service and amenities were far from restaurant quality. Tap water could not be provided, there was no waiter to take your order (you had to walk up to the counter to order food), and they did not accept credit/debit card payment. Finally, the seating area is more like a cafe than a restaurant, with shoppers walking around inches away from your table. All of this is fine if Pistachio were a casual cafe, but at the prices it charges, this is not acceptable.The prices on the menu also do not reflect GST, so expect your final damage to be higher than you thought.On the bright side, the pita with hummus is delicious and great value-for-money.Save your money for somewhere else, and come just for the pita.",

The service is excellent. The owners are extremely friendly. I look forward to my next trip to Singapore, so I can eat here again. Bring your own wine as they don't have a liquor license.",
