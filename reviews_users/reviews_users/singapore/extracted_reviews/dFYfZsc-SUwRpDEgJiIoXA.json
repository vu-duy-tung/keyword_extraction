    "text": "I know I know...this place is good for its peking duck! But not everyone is in love with duck, just like me... So I had to order its roasted chicken.. Verdict is: It's damn fuckin good, the meats are roasted to perfection, very juicy and succulent... They also provide additional spiced salt on the side for you to sprinkle on top of your chicken! The skin is also heavenly crispy, very nice texture and the saltiness is just right! However, other than roasted duck or chicken, other food menu just taste mediocre and bland (probably because they promote low sodium diet??! So could be either good or bad depends on individual..)Hint: might need to reserve due to high popularity among locals and expats (both for table and roasted chicken/duck..no kidding)...",

Really worth your calories . The balance of the duck meat - we usually ask the Chef to fry it with Ee fu noodles together with mushroom. And then, we will add black vinegar to it. So yummy.......Another yummy dish is their soup. The Chef uses superior broth for the soup. They boil their soup for hours & we can taste the sweetness of it. Very worth dining in this restaurant.",

    "text": "The Peking duck is really good here and I wouls definitely recommend it. But I do suggest that you book the table in advance and also reserve the duck. You don't want to turn up at your table and be told no duck left!The Peking duck is served three ways with a chef displaying his duck cutting skills. The first serving is the duck skin which you dip in sugar. The duck skin was crispy and we hardly noticed any fat on it.The second serving is the duck meat which we wrapped in pancake, with cucumbers, spring onions and hoi sin sauce.The third and final serving is the one where you can choose how you would like the remaining duck meat to be cooked. For an additional charge, we choice the remaining duck meat stir fry with noodles. I actaully prefer this over the lettuce wrap which you usually find in most the restaurants I have had Peking duck.Peking duck is an intereating dish because it is clever how one duck can create three different dishes!",

    "text": "one of my favorite restaurants, from possibly my favorite group of restaurants in singapore - I associate the imperial treasure line of restaurants (referring to the higher echelons here) with reliable, delicious, traditional cooking in sleek, modern environs and I haven't been let down by a meal here before.it's one of my family's regular haunts for dimsum or a good dinner, and the eponymous dish is glisteningly shiny and crisp, the meat tender and really rather juicy. they slice off the skin with some of the best parts of the duck for you to dip in sugar (sounds weird, but tastes great), before the thicker, more substantial slices arrive to be wrapped in thin egg skins with slivers of cucumber and spring onion.you then have the choice to take your duck sliced and eaten neat, or to have it cooked up (there's a surcharge for this latter option). it commonly goes into a noodle stir-fry, but we like it chopped up and salt-and-peppered into garlicky, bony chunks. it's not an option if you a. don't like garlic or b. don't like bones, but the kitchen's probably expert enough to cater to your choice.we finished with a sweet heavy-on-the-plum sauce pork rib that was very fatty (but therefore also very juicy) in a sauce that was possibly too sweet, and some cleansing greens topped with mushrooms.it's good food - and for such a lovely, sleek restaurant, prices aren't too expensive. the restaurants at the higher price points in the imperial treasure group all make fantastic options for great chinese food, at qualities you'd usually associate with the old-school, venerated hotel chinese restaurants (that have price points to match).",

    "text": "I come here for my Peking duck fix! The duck here is superb, with a thin, crispy, flavorful skin that doesn't have too much fat. The meat is also tender, and the skins that you wrap it up in are wonderfully thin, so it does not detract from the taste.You ate asked to eat the skin dipped in a bit of sugar first, as that's how it was traditionally eaten in the past. After that you move on to have the duck in the wrap. The dark sauce is thick and sweet, but not overly so.At $68 for a whole duck, it's pretty good value for a nice dinner. You definitely have to make reservations and order it in advance as they have a limited number of ducks, so walk-ins normally won't be entertained. I went on a Friday evening and all the tables were booked out. We were also asked to vacate our table by a certain time for the next customers.We also tried the roasted suckling pig and it was fantastic. The skin was thin and crispy, not too much fat, and after you are done, they chop up the rest of the pig for you.The ambience is that of a typical Chinese restaurant, and the whole place has been done up very nicely. Service is fast and efficient, but the place does get a bit manic when it's busy. Great place for family dinners to impress the parents! :)",

    "text": "Yay! I like this place. Mostly consistently good food (a couple duds I will point out later). I've been to this branch twice, once for a company dinner and today for dim sum with family!Peking duck - order in advance! $68 for whole duck. And $10 for add on stir fry meat, or meat in noodle/rice, or lettuce wraps. We had the lettuce wraps the first time and weren't particularly enamoured with it. Today we had the duck meat stir fried in black pepper sauce (the way the AMAZING black pepper beef is done), that was pretty gd but not as good as the beef! The black pepper beef is to die for. Seriously. It melts in your mouth. Oh, also, it's spicy :) Just a warning.Dim sum here is fairly reasonable, about $4+-$6+ per basket of dim sum. Goodies first:1. Har gao - 4 plump juicy ones nested inside, thin enough skin, bouncy prawns ($5)2. Crispy prawn rice roll - Cheong fan with almost a tempura type of prawn inside, served with the soy sauce on the side so it doesn't get soggy ($6) - this I first had in Hong Kong and so really doesn't match up to that version, but was still pretty gd. My bro's favourite dish!3. Normal prawn rice roll - delicious! thin skin and yummy sauce. $5.504. Carrot cake - chunks of radish inside! $4.20 for 3 pcs. nice pan fry. Mom liked it.5. Liu sha bao - this was rated as one of the top five in Singapore by Daniel Ang (food blogger), I thought it was pretty gd but wasn't all that amazed by it.. It was molten, at least :p The bao itself was fairly thick. ($4.20 for 3)Not so good:1. Glutinous rice w chicken ($4 for 2 pcs) - not much ingredients! or I thought there weren't enough.. May have been spoilt by other places :p2. Chive dumpling $4.20 for 3 - a bit strange, had pork inside. I thought it's supposed to be mostly chives!3. BBQ pork bun ($4.20 for 3) - I have to admit I've probably been spoilt by HK's Tim Ho Wan version.. Now I cannot accept anything less :pThey also serve yummy sweet cashews as the side dish for you to munch on while waiting. Food came pretty quickly though! Really good service, I reserved a table for six and they gave us a private room with our own server. Quite impressed. Didn't get such good treatment the last time we came for company dinner! :p",

The Peking duck was one of the best I had so far perfectly executed the chef was very skilled in delivery slicing the duck it was awesome! The other dishes were also excellent.

    "text": "This is the first time having Peking Duck in Singapore. I arrived in Singapore just the night before (from Canada), and this was a great meal to begin my trip.The highlight of the night was definitely the Peking Duck meal - of which, was unique in the way it was served.The duck was carved off the side of our table, and began with a series of super-thin crispy skin pieces. The pieces were delicious on their own, but also tasted well with the hosin sauce or the sugar to dip in.Next we were served with additional slices of duck (skin + meat). The cuts were not overly fatty, and was substantial.At the same time, to the table came wrapped duck pancakes (stuffed with green onion). I'm used to building these myself, but appreciated that they came pre-wrapped for ease.Finally, they cooked the rest of the duck meat in a rice dish and a noodle dish (we ordered 2 ducks). The rice was better than the noodles in my opinion.We also ordered an assortment of dishes. The one that stood out the most, was the diced black pepper beef dish. It was savory and I would not hesitate to order it again.",

    "text": "A lot of restaurants serve peking duck but very seldom they do it well. This I do love the food especially the peking duck but sometimes I find it rather \"stressful\" eating here. The restaurant usually get an overwhelming dining crowd that they implement several different timing for seating. Generally you have to adhere to the timing you were given as they may lurk around your table to let you know that you need to vacate your table for the next customer. Once, my friend and I had left quite an impression to the wait staff there. There were 5 of us who wanted to go on our mission to \"devour a duck\". We decided that its not 1 but 2 ducks that we would like to conquer. I made the reservation saying that we need a table of 5 and would like to pre-order 2 peking ducks. They took the reservation, called me the morning before to confirm the reservation and duck order. That evening when we got to the table, the greeter gave us a order chit indicating that we order 1 duck. We had the impression that they may give us the 2nd order chit for the duck when we request for it. So we left it as that and ordered the rest of the dishes to accompany our quest. We ordered a fair bit of dishes and chose 2nd dish for the duck body to be prepared with Salt and Pepper. \u00a0When we were down with the lovely dinner, we called the server over. She had the impression that we would like the bill but we told her we are not done with our meal and want the 2nd duck to be served. and would like the 2nd dish to be shred duck meat yee mee. \u00a0hehehe.. She was caught off guard. She ask if we would be having the yee mee to go in case we can't finish. \u00a0We replied we will have it here too. She and a few other servers had a priceless look on their face when they heard. In fact, another server came to confirm our orders. When we were done, one of the servers actually applauded. Once again, we called them back. Again, we weren't asking for the bill. \u00a0This time we were asking for dessert menu. After we were done with the desserts, we finally asked for bill. Hahaha... the wait staff must be saying to themselves \"Finally this 5 people stop eating :P \"",

I agree with another review, that it is not as oily as the roast duck sold commonly in hawker centers. Somehow though, it just lacks the \"oomph\" factor. I blame it on the fact that maybe the lack of flavors in the duck meat. The meat just tasted like good tasty duck meat, but if there was some way to cook it so it can be more smoky, or maybe an herbal tinge, I think the duck would be much better. The dim sum here is pretty decent as well, on par with the likes of crystal jade dining in. The roast pork and salted egg custard bun were the more noteworthy dishes. Definitely a good place to go if you have a peking duck and dim sum craving.",

Peking Duck- Simply phenomenal. Crispy skin for every bite, and even the fattier thigh/leg slices maintained their crispy skin. Meat was juicy, not one piece was dried out. Even though the duck was split between only two people, we didn't come away from the meal feeling super heavy. Peking Duck Second Way: \u00a0The belly of the duck was diced finely and cooked to a crisp as part of a mix of fried vermicelli, onions, garlic, and bamboo was stir fried and put into lettuce wraps. Usually this method is reserved for pigeon meat- but it was a hit with this duck. Jelly Fish Head- a great appetizer with good crunchy texture, and just the right amount of flavor. XO sauce Eggplant Noodle (meepok)- Eggplant texture was perfect- soft, not mushy, the noodles were shrimp-flavored egg noodles, which when paired with XO sauce, just gave the dish that much more umami. Wonderfully tasty yet simple noodle dish. Crabmeat with egg white and truffle oil. *Jaw drops*. \u00a0Just. So. Good. It's pricey, but it's worth it. The meal we had set us back $200+ SGD- but this meal was hands down worth every cent.",

We ordered a variety of dim sum / several cooked dishes (fish, soup, veggie) and of course the Peking Duck. The dim sum is decidedly average - much prefer TP at nearby Ion Mall. The cooked dishes are a bit better but nothing particularly special / and below what I expected from this famous restaurant. Soup / Veggie were standard but the fish was not the freshest I have had / expected. The Peking Duck was indeed good and probably the savior of the meal but nonetheless is far from the better peking ducks I have had. The meat lacks a bit of juiciness, the wrapper a bit thick and the sauce just misses the mark somehow. Overall for the price ($50/pax) would rather go somewhere else",

    "text": "Alright so in Singapore for a quick day trip and decided to check out a few spots that seemed to receive rave reviews. On the top of the list was Peking Duck as it had been a few years since I've had good ones on the east coast within North America. After a bit of searching, was able to find this spot within the yelp & tripadvisor scene and decided to call the St Regis to book us a reservation. Keep in mind for folks that you must make a reservation if you want to guarantee a duck for your meal. The joint itself is in one of the millions of malls that are all connected underground for what seems like endless distances. Had a reservation right at opening team so found myself making my way over there on time after walking around for some shopping during a rainy humid day. The spot is fancy on the outside and inside offering what seems like an upscale environment for your lunching pleasures. We were greeted promptly for our reservation and seated immediately with the waiter confirming we had ordered the duck. Since this was our priority, we ended up only ordering this which was plenty of food. They brought out the duck and start to go to work to prepare it multiple ways. We received the skin first which was slightly oily but good and remember to dip it into the sugar for the flavor. There wasn't as much skin as I would have wanted but still the quality was solid. The next was the belly of the duck sliced which is to be used with the onions, cucumber slices, and the pancakes to be used to make a wrap. They then proceeded to make the final third dish by mixing it with rice for us which ended up being a tasty closing treat for us. The quality of the duck and the way it was cooked was solid while offering good flavor. This place is a solid spot and certainly somewhere I will consider for duck when I am back in the area.",

Service here is also excellent as the waiters are very attentive, and even regularly change your plates.Dim sum is excellent as well. The prices here are on the higher side (it is in Paragon after all), but I'd say it is well worth it!Will definitely come back again!",

Even though it is not the authentic Peking Duck but this Singapore version is freaking delicious :)Other dishes which I have tried[Cubed beef fillets with garlic chips] - Not sure how they prepare and cook it. I don't care. The meat is so tender and good.....MUST TRY[Steamed fish - forgot the name] - Very fresh. Love the sauce which goes really well with steamed rice.[Stir fry Siew Bak Choy with garlic] - Nothing special [Crab with ginger/ shallots ] - Very good. Each piece of crab is packed with meat and flavorful.I would highly recommend this restaurant for special occasion celebrations or family gatherings !

I suggest a hallway booth reservation (up to 4-people) for a more intimate experience. You can close your glass doors and shut out the noise from the main dining room. Also, this place is BYOB with no corkage fee.As noted by other diners, the menu is overall well executed, but few offerings rival the quality of the duck. Be prepared to order during your reservation.Aside, there are two menu pages devoted to abalone and shark fins, which I found both shocking and interesting. Don't be put off when both the reservation taker and hostess confirm you have exactly 90-minutes to enjoy your duck love fest before hitting the road.Total damage for 2-diners was S$143.",

I'm not usually a big fan of wontons and would never order them myself but couldn't resist trying one of hubby's when I saw how perfectly crisp and crunchy the skin was. It tasted as good as it looks. My roast duck was divine as well, with the skin thin, crispy and not too oily. The restaurant was very busy and we didn't have a reservation so were seated at a counter by the wall. The staff were all rushing around and the service didn't appear as slick and efficient as you would expect given the restaurant appearance, and the phone was constantly ringing off the hook as well. We were also charged for an item we neither ordered or received which we didn't realise until later. I'm happy we were able to be seated and we enjoyed the food, I'm not sure if perhaps they were just short staffed that day but the service could do with some improving.",

But once we reached the venue, we were greeted with \"I'm sorry, we don't have your reservation listed here\"While we thought it was going to be a terrible disappointment, the lady at the reception was very nice to try her best to help us arrange for a table. Within 30 minutes, they managed to release a table for us.The dishes we ordered included:1. The Peking Duck (OF COURSE!!) - The meat of the duck was used to cook with Eefu noodles for our friend's birthday celebration2. The Spicy Prawns (not really spicy though but the prawns are juicy)3. Vegetable with 3 eggs 4. Pan Fried Beancurd5. Sweet and Sour PorkThe food were all delicious and we had a great time since it was our friend's birthday but the duck came only after the gravy laden dishes were served thus we had to make our own peking duck wrap on a wet plate, not very wise. The Eefu noodles also took very long to come after all the other dishes had been served and consumed making it a long waiting in between the dishes to the final course.Other than the above hick ups, the overall experience was pleasant.Advice: After making a booking, if they don't call you 1-2 days before your reserved date, please call back to check/confirm.",

Maybe he thought we were going to order an entire duck or something since that was the specialty. We had a table that was outside and it was a good spot. It was not too noisy compared to the inside tables and the service was good. The wait staff would fill our tea cups every time they walked past. Dim sum dishes were served very quickly. The downside of having a late lunch, after 1pm, was many of its signature or popular dishes were sold out by then. So do go earlier. The regular roast duck was tender and the skin was crispy even though it was not the pipa or peking duck. The liu sha bao (salted egg yolk custard bun) was perfection with a generous filling which would ooze out and drip all over your fingers or chin if you were not careful. The food got cold fast though so you definitely need to eat fast. We were too busy talking that by the time we got to the siew mai and prawn rice rolls, they were a bit hard and dry and cold.",

A solid four for the Peking Duck - the display and presentation of the duck (sternum first, sliced in front of \u00a0you, and served with hoi sin and sugar, followed by sliced duck as a second dish), although for me, the non meat eater, the eye was in the beholder, but not the taster. Three stars for the hostess deciding we didn't need the tofu dish that we had ordered, and took several requests before we actually had it, because 'we had ordered enough'. Five stars to my buddy who insisted on getting the tofu before any further orders (desserts, drinks, you name it) would happen.

Started with 2 slices of the skin for your first taste, then there are 3 ways to enjoy this duck:The first: dip it with sugar and enjoy it right away, i'm not a fan of sugar so I did not try this way. The second: Dip duck in the thick sweet creamy brown hoi sin sauce then wrap it together with sliced fresh cucumber and thin sliced spring onion in a slice of steamed pancake. The fresh cucumber & spring onion help to balance the greasy of skin. This is the typical way to enjoy the peking duck. Highly recommended.The third: they will ask you how you'd like to cook with the remaining meat, which can be chopped, or stirred fry with noodle or rice.The price is affordable, 75sgd (not include tax & service charge) for the whole duck for 4 people, other dishes such as fried rice or noodle from 15sgd.Other dishes are typical Chinese cuisines which taste and smell also really good.",

It is a nice posh enough place if you are bringing an overseas guest, and the food is great.The duck is obviously their signature, especially if your restaurant name is super duck. They serve it a little different from other Peking duck restaurants, the slices are served with a sliver of meat. They will only cut out a few slices of pure crispy skin to start your meal. The rest of the skin is served with a little meat to go with the rest of the condiments. The duck is nicely roasted, crisp on the outside, succulent on the inside and not overly oily. I also love the homemade steamed skin that they serve to wrap the Peking duck. It is like a thin popiah skin, not those eggroll off the shelf kind.The seafood Ee fu noodles is also yummy. Not soggy like those you get at wedding dinners. The seafood sweetness is there and the noodles are still al dente.Plus BYO!",

    "text": "Frankly, I cannot understand the rave about the Peking duck here. After hearing such wonderful reviews about the Peking duck served here, I was deeply disappointed by what I had today. As a roast duck, it was really good. The meat was juicy and flavorful, the skin was slightly crispy with almost the right amount of fat. As Peking duck though, the skin to meat ratio was off - too much meat. The skin was oil-soaked and not crispy enough. So when put in the wrap, it was a lot of meat, not enough skin. I was rather confused. I thought I was having Peking duck. You could have fooled me. The service was excellent, after we had to demand for our table after politely waiting for half an hr despite a reservation. And after I took a napkin and offered to help the staff clean the table since they seemed completely swamped. I figured they had to be since they sat us at a dirty table after making us wait for 40mins. The standard of service seemed incongruent to their presentation and pricing. I was fooled once again!That being said, I'd still like to give them the benefit of the doubt that it's cny and the restaurant has taken on more than they can chew, thus the fluctuation in standard of food and service. Though I really expected an established restaurant such as this to be able to handle to assess their ability a lot better. I really expected a lot better. I guess I expected too much. I won't be forking out money to come and eat here again.",
