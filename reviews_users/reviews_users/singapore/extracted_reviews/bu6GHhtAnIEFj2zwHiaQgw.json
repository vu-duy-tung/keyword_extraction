    "text": "My favorite South Indian restaurant in Singapore so far. \u00a0It's a chain from Bangalore, and the Singapore branch, opened earlier this year, is the first one outside India. Their masala dosas are amazing, the crispiest and lightest I've had anywhere. I've also had a few new dishes I'd never had before, such as bisele bath, which is sort of like a tomatoey rice stew, made with rice, lentils, cashew nuts, carrots, and other goodness. My other favorite is kharabath, which is kind of like an Indian polenta, made from semolina with a bunch of spices.The older gentleman who takes your order at the front counter is very helpful and friendly, and patiently explains and recommends different dishes. He also backs up the talk - today, he told my friend and me to try their freshly ground coffee instead of just ordering Cokes, and said if we weren't happy with it we should come and see him afterwards. Thankfully, there was no need for fisticuffs with the old dude, because the coffee was damn good.",

    "text": "Excellent vegetarian restaurant with amazing bisi bela bhaat, good dosas, decent idlis. Ordering is a pain and almost negates all the good. The set up is plain silly - you will spend ages queueing in the cramped entryway. Everyone takes ages to decide. Huge menu. Several 'day of the week' items + daily specials complicate things further. Always sell out of some so you choose and choose again. And worse, typically gluten free South Indian dishes (such as idlis and dosas etc) have been modified to add \"rava\" which is semolina and thus wheat-based. Wish these guys would find someone who could help them fix the simple things that make a great restaurant concept with pretty good food a mediocre experience.Suggestions if management is listening - Change ordering location and system. Add simple descriptions of dishes. List ingredients. Simplify the menu - put day of the week dishes and daily specials on a separate one or board. Let people enjoy the whole experience.",

They might have been working out some kinks as it was fine, but not amazing when we went. I had a dosai, which was good, interesting texture (thicker and crispier than usual), with a layer of coriander sauce on the inside and a good filling, but I found it a bit too strong on the ghee for my taste. mylifeinsin.com/2013/06/\u2026Not everything is available at all times of day, I really wanted the chilli pakoras but they are only available during \"snack\" times of the day.

Hence it's better to take a look at the menu, which is placed outside the restaurant before entering so that you don't feel rushed.

The restaurant is a bit on the small side and they must be popular as there was a small queue when we arrived on an early Saturday afternoon around 2pm. They have a good system to minimize waiting by allowing you to place your order and pay while in the queue then being seated closer to when your food is ready as all orders take about 10 minutes.My guess is b/c everything is made fresh to order. They specialize in South Indian cuisine and everything is vegetarian. The place is spotless, well lit, and air conditioned. A big pitcher of water with napkins are also available at all tables which is totally worth the extra few dollars you'll pay per dish than at say Banana Leaf.Everything was delicious, especially the tomato rice dish (wish I remembered the name). The set meal I had was also good, comes with a couple of fluffy pooris, white rice, daal, etc and good value for money.I think we've found a new favorite Indian spot in Singapore!",
