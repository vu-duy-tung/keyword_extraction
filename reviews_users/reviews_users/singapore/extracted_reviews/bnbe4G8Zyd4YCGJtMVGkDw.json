    "text": "This place was excellent, exactly what you would expect from a high quality buffet. It had mainly Malay, Chinese, and Indian food and every bit of it was so delicious. I started off with the laksa which is one of my favorite dishes I have had in Singapore, then transitioned into the heavier foods. They have a great spread of cold cuts, pat\u00e9, and jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico, aside a large selection of cheeses to choose from. Their sushi selection is not too extensive but it does have the main crowd favorites: salmon, tuna, yellowtail. They have both sashimi and nigiri, as well as a few simple sushi rolls to choose from. They had a great seafood selection and delicious fresh oysters too!I loved their salted egg chicken wings! They taste exactly like salted egg and are so so good! Very crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor, I wish I had gotten more. They also have a unique selection of bread, the wheat and seaweed ones were my favorite. The desserts were one of my favorite parts of the buffet! There was every kind of pastry imaginable, and you bet your ass I tried them all! Lol my favorites were the Carmel br\u00fbl\u00e9e, truffles, and gelato. But there are so many more I am probably not remembering so be sure to give them all a taste, they are small portions so as long as you pase yourself you should be fine.The service was just as good as the food. Our server was cheetah, I apologize I I spelled that incorrectly. He was very attentive and checked up on us very frequently to clear our plates. This place was a great experience but keep in mind it is very expensive. We ordered all you can drink which was about $40 per person; there were three of us and we totaled over $400. But this was for a special occasion and they even brought out a candle and a plate with not one, but FULL of different pastries to sing me happy birthday!",

Despite the aging Ritz Carlton starting to appear more like an average Marriott than a Ritz, The Colony restaurant inside was a treat both in design and quality.Stepping into this uniquely designed space, there is a sense of surprise and confusion. The confusion arises from the vastly dispersed food selections throughout, making the breakfast appear endless. The dividers, decorated with antiques and imagery of Singapore provide a museum like feel to what would otherwise be a buffet. Selections are very vast, making it difficult to make a decision. Every piece of the meal was amazing, with the exception of one dish, the chicken curry in the Malay section which was not prepared well and the chicken very dry.The service was spectacular and the buffet selections even beat out The St Regis where we spent the last evening in Singapore. Sitting next to the bamboo garden here is very relaxing and the building provides a fair share of natural light. So, don't get discouraged by the otherwise sad looking architecture of this building and the cramped, boring entrance into the property, this restaurant is a must for luxurious breakfast.",

Desserts are phenomenal and I love that they make sure they have a local twist to most of them.It's a great setting that everyone truly walks away happy.

The cake wasn't too sweet and the flavors (chocolate, raspberry and hazelnut) and textures (the silky smooth cremeux, melt-in-your-mouth mousse, and crunchy hazelnut) complemented one another perfectly. Not to mention the fact that the cake was absolutely gorgeous, with gold dust, glittery gold streaks against the sheen of chocolate ganache, and dark chocolate shapes that tasted divine. I couldn't ask for more in a dessert. Best enjoyed at tea time with a cup of black coffee, because I'm usually too full after dinner and wouldn't be able to appreciate it.",

    "text": "High-end hotels in Singapore know how to buffet.Colony is at The Ritz Carlton and $88++ for dinner here is a STEAL.What makes Colony unique is that they not only have an impressive western selection, but they have dedicated stalls that specialize in Singaporean cuisine. You can easily get famous dishes such as chicken rice, chilli crab, dim sum, laksa (with lobster!), and Indian food here. Everything is high quality, but if you're a tourist here, I still recommend that you go outside and try all these at their respective restaurants for a more authentic experience. As a resident here, I decided to focus on their western spreads. Of course, I loaded up on all the fancy cheeses and charcuterie. I really enjoyed their roast, along with all the curries in the Indian section. The desserts also had a western focus, with things like cookies, ice cream sundaes, and pies, though they did have some nice kuehs to choose from. Considering the ambiance and price, this is a great place to go for special occasions with the family, or celebrating a milestone birthday or job promotion with friends who are picky!",

The Colony at the Ritz Carlton is a buffet you literally dream about. \u00a0At some point during the buffet, I literally thought I was stealing. The SGD88 price per person vs. the collection of food offered is simply absurd!First the seafood bar is out of this world. What buffet offers three types of oysters: Canadian, French and Irish so customers can different tasting oysters from sweet to salty to creamy to everything in between. Wow! Obviously, these oysters are air flown from where ever they are located in the world, so don't expect absolute freshness. Nevertheless, it was more than satisfying. Next to the oyster baskets are whole crabs, half cracked lobster claws (the ones you find in Maine), mussels, clams. Honestly, I couldn't contain myself. No where in Singapore can eat 3 whole lobsters and a dozen oysters in one sitting and not break the bank.Other than the seafood bar, there was a sushi/sashimi bar, Indian buffet, Chinese / Singaporean buffet. Other note worthy dishes included: all you can eat Chilli Crab Claws, butter grilled half cut lobster tails, XO fried rice. The Ambience is great, perfect for a Friday night date, and service is impeccable. A must try, indeed!",

    "text": "After a six-month period renovation, the all-time popular buffet restaurant arm of The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore, opens with a new concept and name called \"Colony\", which draws inspirations from the rich heritage of Singapore's colonial history. What could be better to relish an authentic afternoon tea experience than having a traditional British style three-tier afternoon tea set here? \u00a0In fact, decor is a key draw here.I was instantly attracted to the eclectic settings when I stepped in. Adorned on the walls and partitions are old maps, photographs, alongside with vintage black-and-white crockery which I secretly wished I could bring some back home. In line with the concept of the restaurant, there is some local twist to what would otherwise be a strictly English tea. The golden raisins and plan scones, baked in-house, was served with scented Kaya jam, clotted cream and lemon curd, which somehow reminds me of a delicious Kaya toast when I put everything into my mouth. The second deck and third deck feature an assortment of sandwiches and sweet pastries, including a entire slab of peppered foie gras on beef pastrami! Simply too indulgent!But if you jumped to the conclusion that it is the usual mixed of sweets, savouries and scones, then you are wrong. It includes a plate of incredibly fluffy savoury pancake, topped with sour cream and French caviar for that touch of luxe. And when it comes to tea, it's serious business here. Go for the signature brew called Colony Tea, a custom blend of black and white Sumatran tea leaves from Tea Bone Zen Mind that is soothing without any bitter or harsh tang. The most unique aspect is the addition of flavored syrup such as French Rose, Ginger, Lavender, Palm and Cinnamon, Pandan and Pineapple to enhance the tea. They work to tease out the nuances of the tea and create a therapeutic experience as one slowly sips along with the light bites.Available daily except Sundays, this afternoon tea also comes with a glass of Moet & Chandon Brut Imperial Champagne. Indeed, Colony doesn't only set itself apart from other local high tea by virtue of its nostalgic charm, the quality of food and tea are highly accomplished as well. If you favour both substance and style, this would fit the bill.",

    "text": "This is a review for a Sunday buffet brunch at Colony restaurant, main level of the Ritz Carlton. Formerly branded as the Greenhouse, the Ritz has put much thought and effort into reorganizing the buffet areas into a more consolidated and efficient operation. They've also changed the feel of the dining room by adding partition walls that display framed stock photos all with the theme: colonization.The effect of the heavily used partition wall modules is that of a Pottery Barn store. The feel is that all of the framed photos are on display to sell. The only thing missing are the price tags. The Wall Modules break up the large space creating a more intimate dining experience. What is lost is the joy of people watching during the brunch. With the serving stations all moved to a remote (mostly hidden) location at the rear of the restaurant and the partition walls segmenting the space into smaller dining areas, the feel is not as good as the Greenhouse. The wide spectrum of food offerings are enough to please any palette. Local, Indian, Western, Seafood, Cheese, Breads, Desserts, etc. In addition to the free flow champagne, bartenders are on duty to make Bloody Marys and Espresso Martinis. I had several of each and both were delicious.The staff is friendly, well trained and attentive. Champagne glasses were always kept full, empty plates continually cleared, and Bloody Marys and Martinis delivered upon request. The Good: Food Quality, Staff, AmbianceThe Bad: I'm not a fan of the maze-like new partition wall modules that detract from the grand architectural space and prefer the more open and spacious feel of the Greenhouse. Hands down, the Greenhouse was a much better brunch experience.The Verdict: Colony is a prime player in the Singapore Sunday Brunch scene. Glad to have visited, but I think I'll wait for the bi-annual \"Super Brunch\" before returning.",
