    "text": "First of all this place is probably more $$, at most $$ and half not $$$. We ended up paying SG$150 for 4, but there was a lot of food and plenty of beer. Without beer it would've been SG$40 less. One panful of pork (knuckles, ribs, roast veg) and rosti, pommes de terre wedges and sauerkraut. Great value if you ask me. There was just too much food and we ended taking home about 1/4 of the food.The food was delish, although the sauerkraut wasn't as good as I expected (then again I'm no sauerkraut connoisseur, and this may be what good sauerkraut was supposed to taste like). Meat was especially outstanding although the brown sauce could've been thicker.View (of Sentosa) was fantastic and the waitstaff were extremely diligent/attentive. The main waiter even explained how we could attain the 10% discount immediately (buy/preload a loyalty card and then register online using their free wifi and then pay using the card (supplement w credit card if insufficient) after the meal). Best meal since I returned to Singapore a month and a half ago!!",

After eating for a bit, we realized we never got our appetizer so we asked about it.The server said we do not get it because we ordered from a \"different menu.\" Not knowing what that meant, we asked if ours is cheaper or had bigger portions.The server responded saying it's exactly the same.So i asked why we dont get an appetizer then and she said because we pointed at a \"different menu\" and gave us SO MUCH ATTITUDEWHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!so stupid. never going back.",

    "text": "Disappointed with the curry wurst and gluhwein. gluhwein should be kind of heady, intense, festive; sugar on the rim cheapens it, makes it just a fruity drink, even moreso than sangria.fries with curry wurst were served too hot, and the curry sauce just tasted like ketchup. basically it tasted like a naked hotdog with cumin, and a pitifully small salad.it was all thoroughly mediocre and hard to justify given the prices.the beer was good and the location could be nice of you sit outside. but \u00a0the food",

The smoked salmon was also not salty which is always a plus!The black forest ham fladden was also a good choice. The ham was not too salty and complemented well with the rocket greens. The service however was really slow as they were understaffed and some of our special requests for our order were forgotten.",

We love the sausage platter and the pork knuckle ... the crisp skin is amazing! The mashed potato is really yummy and the sauerkraut does a good job of providing some contrast in taste to the meat overdose.Dad likes the beers quite a bit and they have interesting fruit beers like mango and banana ... light enough for the ladies who aren't into the heavier stuff.",

    "text": "I often go down to Brozeit for my monthly tarot group gatherings (yes, my tarot group books a section of Brozeit and you'll see a group of people discussing tarot card, buying tarot cards and doing \u00a0practice tarot readings). Most of the time, my friends orders their beer there which they claim is one of the best. For me, I settled for their tea and I'm a big fan of their mashed potatoes and potato wedges. Just something about it that makes it so yummy. Their main dishes are HUGE, so don't say you have not been warned. The ambiance here is lovely as it is facing RWS so the view is often unobstructed if you request for outdoor seating. It's a nice place to chill out with friends or a significant other if you are around the area.",

I hadn't been to Brotzeit before and was hoping for good, non-touristy dishes. Most of the dishes were Bavarian which is a false representation for Germany. But I still liked them and thought they were well chosen and prepared. One of my friends is vegetarian and we got Schupfnudeln with cheese. He loved it and later returned with other friends for Kaiserschmarrn (shredded pancake). I'd bring friends there again. If I was in Singapore...",

    "text": "So I was here for junk food and dessert one day (yes, yes, a sausage place for dessert, what was I thinking - but hey, I do these things so you don't have to!). Ordered up some stuff to share, namely the fried camembert and shredded pancake. The fried cheese was nothing out of the ordinary, being crumb coated and served with a tart cranberry sauce. The shredded pancake, on the other hand, was way out of what I'd expected. I was imagining delicate strands of pancake, not unlike rosti but what was plated couldn't be further away from my own imagery. It was more of roughly cut as opposed to shredded, and dusted liberally with icing sugar. Kinda tastes like egg sponge cake, or kueh, given it's dense texture. The accompanying plum sauce was tangy, and overall, I found it a little too weird for my liking. Service is brisk and although the place gets terribly crowded, you're still assured of prompt service and regular refills of water.",

While it definitely pales in comparison to the authentic european experience, the casual laid back vibe here takes one away from the hustle and bustle of the daily grind for a few moments. Of course, a great pint of chilled beer can only add to one's enjoyment. Their house pours are really yummy. Not an avid beer fan, I tend to shy away from most brands of beers but I love their Erdinger beer, slightly fruity and light, it is a brilliantly refreshing drink to end the day with. They do fantastic bratwurst and sauerkraut as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food there. However, my dining companion's chicken schnitzel was too dry. The service staff are also very friendly and patient, offering their recommendation on beers and dishes if you have any problems ordering. The last time I was there, they had a television screening a football match, so it can get pretty rowdy when a certain sport event is going on (especially football). Other than that, this is a pretty ideal place to end the day at, unwinding from work with a pint of beer and some german delicacies.",

The lighter beers like Weissbier and lager obviously go down easier in the Singapore weather, but it is also nice to occasionally quaff a glass of the darker (Dunkel) brews.The sausage platters are not half bad either - good quality meat and sides - sauerkraut, potato wedges and mashed potatoes are some of the options. The garlic sausage and curry wurst particularly stood out in my mind.",
