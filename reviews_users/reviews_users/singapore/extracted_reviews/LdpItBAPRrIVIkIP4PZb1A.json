    "text": "Our friends recommended us this restaurant located in the Tanglin Mall, and it's delicious. One of the better QUALITY thai dining in Sing, which is hard to find. I dare to say that it was similar in taste and quality to some of the dishes at the actual Blue Elephant royal thai cuisine we tried in Bangkok, Thailand. But this is Singapore, and any of the quality dishes come with a hefty price tag, even if it's thai food. So expect to spend around $100 for a party of two, without any drinks. While we love other thai dishes, we just stuck with our typical favorite:Shrimp Pad thaiChicken Pad SiewPineapple Fried RiceMango Sticky Riceseems like a lot to share between the two, but the portions are tiny and we were scraping the plates for more. Mango sticky rice dessert was just okay- we still haven't found one that parallels the taste we fell in love with in Thailand. \u00a0overall, perfect place for a regular date night or couple dates!",

The Thai tea is a must have - so pretty you can't stop staring at the glass. For dessert give the coconut sticky rice a skip and have the mango cheesecake instead.",

Their baked seafood glass noodles was too salty to eat and only had prawns. Pineapple rice did not even come in a pineapple and was a tad too sweet ( maybe in my opinion). \u00a0We also ordered the Morning Glory at S$19 and that came out very badly stir-fried and too small a portion. Also was very, very salty. The dessert platter was also disappointing with 2 pieces of dragonfruit, some pieces of melon and 2 pieces of Thai rice cakes. Thai fish cakes also tastes like it was from a frozen packet.We knew not to order the Tom Yum Soup which was at best mediocre. Staff were generally friendly, which was the saving grace but service time was too long. Our simple dinner for 2 took 2.5 hours from start to finish. Good quality and experience not worth the prices. Probably my last visit here.",

But the golden pouches are the ones that stood out. \u00a0Wonderful little pouches hiding away a small succulent prawn.tinyurl.com/bb5xe5pHoy Shell (Seared sea scallops on half shell with chili lime dressing) - These were very perfectly prepared scallops with a touch of spice and citrus. \u00a0It was also a beautifully presented dish.tinyurl.com/a8rhvbvTom Yum Goong/Talay (Authentic hot spicy and sour prawns soup with Thai herbs, mushrooms, and sliced of young coconut meat) - This was a good Tom Yum. \u00a0My date requested it be mild. \u00a0I did not object. \u00a0So, it wasn't as super spicy as some versions of this soup. \u00a0The ingredients all came together very well. \u00a0I particularly enjoyed the mushrooms. \u00a0The prawns could have been a touch more tender. But, this is often the case with Tom Yum. \u00a0They keep cooking in the soup. \u00a0I had hoped it would be served in the traditional way. However, instead, we were simply each brought a bowl.tinyurl.com/bgqfce9See Krong Kae Yang (Pan-seared lemongrass marinated rack of lamb served with papaya salad and crisp sweet rice rolls) - This was a lamb lovers lamb. \u00a0It had a strong potent flavour. \u00a0The meat was tender. \u00a0This was another wonderfully presented dish. \u00a0The rice rolls were quite a refreshing balance to the strong flavour of the lamb.tinyurl.com/b5c2pb5Gang Daeng Gai (Thai chicken red curry with coconut heart and baby eggplants) - This was a very good curry. \u00a0The chicken was tender. \u00a0There was lots of depth of flavour. Every once in awhile, I would run into a pepper. \u00a0The heat went so well with the sweetness of the curry. \u00a0It was my favourite dish of the evening.tinyurl.com/beym4nsKhao Phad Poo (Fried rice with crabmeat and spring onions) - My date selected their fried rice with crabmeat. \u00a0it was pretty good. \u00a0It melded well with the other dishes.Thai Coconut - She enjoyed it so much that she had two of them. \u00a0As for me, I had 7-Up.tinyurl.com/a2mxgg5Receipt (Dinner for 2) - $204.80tinyurl.com/agxsz9mWith Thai restaurants, there is often an expectation with price. \u00a0It is often viewed as a lower priced meal. \u00a0However, most Thai restaurants do not provide an experience that works well for a date or special evening. \u00a0They tend to be hurried meals with little service. \u00a0The food is often amazing but the meal is over in 30 minutes. \u00a0The food at Patara is good and, at times, very good. \u00a0But it is not better than many hole in the wall Thai restaurants. \u00a0The presentation is a step up. \u00a0In service and ambiance, Patara delivers beyond most of these and creates a dining experience. \u00a0I feel Patara delivers an experience worthy of the premium.Overall - This was a nice evening meal. \u00a0The ambiance and service live up to the expectations of fine dining. \u00a0The food was consistently well prepared and beautifully presented.",

Even when we asked for the bill it didn't occur to server to ask if we wanted coffee . Overall quite pathetic standard of service ... But then again this is so typical of most local establishments . In the end I asked to see the Manager ... Who looked like she just left school !! I said to minus the 10% service charge from the bill which she obliged. As part of the \"service recovery \", we were offers two $50 vouchers ( each for a min $120 spend on next visit ). Won't be back in a hurry ....",

The other outlet at City Hall has closed, so this is the only one left at this time.The setting is pretty elegant, in tasteful vibrant gold and dark wood, and the dishes come in gorgeous intricate plates. Expect all the staples that you would normally enjoy, including spicy tom yum soup (be sure to make your chilli tolerance known), and mango sticky rice. The best dishes are probably the wonderful olive fried rice, with bits of kaffir lime leaves in it, grilled jumbo prawns with lemongrass sauce, and roast duck curry - always a treat with hot fragrant rice. The service staff seem genuinely pleasant, a good indication of the quality of the Creative Eateries group (which this restaurant belongs to). Their sister restaurant is the more casual Bangkok Jam chain of diners.",
