    "text": "Labyrinth provides what you would expect of a single Michelin star restaurant. A pleasant mix of dishes - some will blow you away (the starter snacks, chilli crab ice cream and short rib were phenomenal) with their flavour and imagination. Others are just delicious (the uni, dumpling and snow.) Coming out at $230sgd for the uni, two cocktails and a third of a bottle of wine, which seemed fairly reasonable. I am glad I went - but also not desperate to return.",

The place is hard to find; once you're in the area the center doesn't seem to list it in obvious places so good luck. From memory, it's on the second floor, near some escalators that are by an entrance that is away from the center 'stage' (?).",

    "text": "The restaurant was located at the space formerly occupied by Space by TungLok. The place was decorated in all blacks. Besides offering lunch set and dinner sets, the restaurant also offered pre-theatre dinner set ($48++) on thursday to saturday at 6pm.TINGKATradish cake, rojak, nasi lemakThe radish cake was in a cylinder cone with a stick in the centre. Tasted not bad although felt it was a tab plain and wished one could taste shredded radish and dried shrimp in it. The crispy square puff was packed with rojak sauce in it. Interesting pack of flavours. The coconut flavoured chwee kueh was topped with sambal, and reminded one of nasi lemak.HIROSHIMA OYSTERlaksaThe noodle was created with coconut milk and a fat juicy hiroshima oyster was used to replace cockles which was usually found in laksa. The floss was spicy with flavours of laksa.DUCKbraised duck dumplingThe dumplings were served in a bamboo basket with soup in a glass bowl. The dumplings were covered in a transparent skin made of sweet potato. Somehow felt that the filling was over flavoured and covered the duck's flavour.TIGER PRAWN ($10 SUPPLEMENT) pen cai risottoThe fa cai had a light and crispy texture. The risotto was well flavoured with oyster sauce, shiitake mushrooms , beancurd skin, and dried shrimps .XIAO LONG BAO chendolA greenish xiao long bao served in a bamboo basket with gula melaka syrup in a small jar. The green skin was made to represent the green jelly strips usually found in chendol. The xiao long bao was packed with jelly cubes and red bean. Interesting pack of flavours when ate it in one mouthful.CIGARreese's peanut butter chocolateThe cigar was a chocolate bar with chocolate creme in it, dusted with cocoa powder, with the bottom part dusted with liquid nitrogen to make look like burn part. It was served in a glass ashtray with peanut crumbles as the burnt ashes. It was accompanied with a glass of earl grey tea with a ball of ice to look like a glass of Cognac. The rich chocolate stick was balanced by the light floral tea.PETIT FOURIt was Dehydrated Pandan with Kaya Butter macaron. It was light and not too sweet.I washed down the meal with a glass of Lychee Martinis ($12++)Vodka, Lychee Liqueur, Lychee Extract which came with 2 pieces of canned lychee and tasted quite sweet.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying the food we had was great - very innovative take on Singapore Street Food. There was only one \"Amuse Bouche\" item (a puff filled with fermented shrimp) which I wasn't a big fan of. The rest was great - especially enjoyed a crab dish which included crab ice spicy cream. There is a Prix Fixe Menu so no choices other than they will upsell you on Wagyu Beef instead of the regular beef and a better shrimp for one of the seafood dishes... I found the upsale thing a bit awkward as they actually come to your table with a slab of Wagyu and some big shrimp and try to convince you to pay the extra amount to improve your dinner... strange approach for a Michelin Starred Fixed Price Menu.The issue I had with the restaurant was mainly the service. We waited a bit before finally asking if we could order a cocktail - our waiter seemed confused about our order (a gin martini and an old fashioned...not very difficult). It was our last night in Singapore and we were looking to get the whole experience starting with drinks...getting some wine with dinner etc. Before our drinks came we were served the Amuse Bouche course...then quickly after that our first course came out....I then asked the waiter if our drinks would be coming out soon...since usually we would have preferred them BEFORE dinner...again the waiter looked confused then asked us again what drinks we had ordered, a little later he returned and said 5 more minutes. By the time we received our drinks the third course was arriving and of course we never got a chance to order wine...Our waiter was friendly but the elaborate explanations of the food was lost on his poor pronunciations. We didn't understand anything he was saying....which was unfortunate as the dishes were remarkably intricate. \u00a0After dinner we were not offered coffee or tea...I guess for the money I would never return or recommend to anyone but it's a shame because the food was really interesting.",

    "text": "6 COURSES DISCOVERY MENU AMUSE BOUCHEWe started with the Street Snacks of Radish Cake, Dehydrated Pandan with Kaya Butter, Rojak and very smooth Nasi Lemak that was served in the Rantang or metal food carrier.I really like the smooth Nasi Lemak that was served like Chwee Kueh with sambal and anchovies as toppings. The savoury radish cake had a crispy edge and was very fragrant, it looked just like a toasty marshmallow. The next Amuse Bouche that we had was the most beautiful keropok / prawn crackers that was injected with squid ink. This keropok was topped with mayo chili and beautiful orange fish roe and edible flower petal. BAK CHOR MEEBak Chor Mee is a popular local dishes and I usually love the distinct flavour of the chili and sourness that comes from vinegar. The Neo-Sin's version was noodle created from the squid skin served together with anchovies in the shape of minced meat and Hokkaido Scallop that looks like a fish cake. It was a miniature version of Bak Chor Mee that you could find in the local street market. You need to mix everything together to get the best flavour. This cute looking Bak Chor Mee was served on a small bowl with rooster on it, a popular bowl that brought out nostalgic feelings of eating street food during my childhood period.HAINANESE CURRY RICEThe miniature forest with bird ness and quail egg looked very magical when the staff served it in front of me. The green moss looked very delicate and who could guess that it was made from coriander. The white clay that covered the potato was imported from Spain, the 'black rock' minced chicken was very delicious and everything was put on the bed of quinoa curry. Again, it's very important to mix in all the elements to gain the true flavour. This was simply my favourite dish of the night, in terms of look as well as the strong spicy flavour that it gave. SINGAPORE CHILI CRABThis was the dish that took my breath away when I saw it on Instagram, so I was very excited about it. The chili ice cream was delicious, even when eaten by itself! It was moreover really delicious when mixed together with the soft shell crab. Presentation of each dish really mattered and it showed from the choice of plates that the restaurant used. This dish was presented on a light blue plate that resembled the sea, covered with mantou sand, some caviar, seaweed and foamy crab bisque.SATAY BEEFHubby was really concerned about the size of the beef when he saw the '80g' next to the menu but he was surprised that the beef was quite big. The Wagyu Ribeye was cooked medium rare, served with gnocchi (onion), satay espuma and rice cakes. The rice cakes in this case was peanut mocha which was skilfully wrapped in banana leaves. The beef was perfectly cooked and with the exact amount of layered fat to make it so enjoyable.XO FISHThe fish of the day was red garoupa with a hidden lobster claw served in the Teochew broth. This dish really reminded me of seafood gumbo although not as thick and heavy. The broth was quite light, filled with seafood flavour and mushroom. I found it best when I mixed the broth with the cooked tomato that was provided so it gave the tangy fresh flavour onto the mix.NEW ITEM: MINI APPLE TOFFEEChef Han came out from his kitchen and said hi to us. Not only that, he also brought out a surprising new item that will only be released in early April. It deceivingly looked like a mini apple toffee.PINAPPLE SORBETOur palate cleanser was a refreshing house-made pinapple sorbet and I joked to the staff that one spoon wasn't enough to clean our palate (hahaha). CHENDOL Xiao Long Bao (XLB)I want more of the Chendol XLB, it was a good start to dessert and the staff was so nice that she helped me take a pour shot by pouring the gula melaka slowly on top of the XLB. For a small item, it was quite rich since it has all the elements of chendol such as red bean, shaved ice and jellies.REESE'S CHOCOLATEThe staff playfully asked whether we smoke or drink before he carried out two ashtray filled with a cigar on each. On the other hand, he gave us a glass of Cognac. It was a peanut butter covered with dark chocolate and the Cognac was the refreshing Earl Grey tea.Now the question on people's mind will usually be 'is it worth the money that I paid for'. For me, it was really worth it especially when you consider the creativity, mixture of ingredients, presentation and passion that went into each dish.I had a very enjoyable night at Restaurant Labyrinth and so excited that they will add some new menu items soon. I went to the kitchen to thank Chef Han for his delicious food and to tell him that he needs to do a pop up dining in Perth... or I should just visit Singapore again.",

I was impressed by the simplicity of the dishes and the amazing flavors that were achieved by combining different ingredients together. I never imaged that a sweet oyster sauce could go so well with fillet steak. My mind was blown!Chef Han's attention to detail and knowledge of the ingredients he uses in his dishes is unmatched. The combination of flavors and tastes create a unique experience that is authentically Singaporean, rather than a so-called fusion of other cuisines. I'm am excited to follow Chef Han as he takes on his next challenge of sourcing his ingredients locally and re-creating an authentic Singaporean fine dining experience, like no other Singaporean chef has done in the past.",
