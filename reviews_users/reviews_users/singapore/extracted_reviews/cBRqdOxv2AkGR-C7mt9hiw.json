    "text": "Really is THE best Cantonese food around. Super authentic, mouthwateringly delicious and incredibly reasonable, I don't know what more you could possibly ask for. I have been coming here for years and often crave it when I'm back in LA. Sure, Singapore is full of delicious Chinese food - we are, after all, a food hub. However, every dish here is cooked to perfection... and that's what sets Hong Kong Street apart from other Cantonese restaurants, in my opinion.There are so many yummy dishes here, I go through phases of \"favorites\". My current favorite? The Pa Ting Yu (Steamed Silver Catfish - I ask for mine with their black bean sauce)... Firstly, the fish is steamed to perfection (moist, melt-in-your-mouth goodness). Secondly, the sauce is on point. (I tend to steer away from Black Bean sauces because of how salty it usually is) However, this one is anything but! You can tell they make their own sauces (or at least that's what it tastes like), not something out of the bottle. Bursting with flavor, yet, not salty at all. Another dish I like is their Sum Lor Hor Fun (Sliced Fish Hor Fun) which, if you aren't familiar, is stir fried flat rice noodles with bean sprouts and sliced fish in gravy. Not soupy, but not dry noodles either. It isn't, however, the black singaporean Hor Fun you might be used to. (I like this one because I feel like it's healthier than normal Hor Fun - whether or not it actually is, might be another story haha) A few other favorites include the Milky Fish Noodle Soup, Salted Fish Fried Rice, Prawn Paste Chicken, Deep Fried Cereal Prawns, Pork Ribs... The place is clean with air-conditioning and the service is good. However, I tend to always take my food to go (maybe I just like eating in the comfort of my home haha) But we usually buy a bunch of dishes from here to-go for dinner when we're too lazy to cook (or have guests over)... Just call ahead and they'll have it ready for you to pick it.",

The tofu hotplate has a couple of prawns, eggs and the minced meat sauce goes very well with white rice. Very tasty.Medium portion serves about 4-5 pax. For a group of 4 pax, we ordered a large plate of vegetable, one medium plate of san lou hor fun, medium prawn paste chicken wing and tofu hotplate. Plus 3 bowls of white rice to share. Pretty filling and would be just nice for 5 pax.The place accepts cash only. Get the receipt/coupon from the cashier for carpark rebate.",

    "text": "There are a lot of Zhi Char places in Singapore that is pretty good, and mostly under rated. This one is over rated. Let's talk about what's good. Prawn paste chicken is pretty good, not the best, but pretty good. The dish came out piping hot, and a bite into the crispy wing reveals moist juciy meat, slight oil can be seen flowing out between those muscles. Cooked just right. The skin is lightly battered and crunchy crisp. The taste is obviously prawn paste, but it's just a tad light. Maybe some customer like it, I prefer more oomph.Balacan kang kong. The balacan is very good. Just enough pungent, bits of shrimps, brings out the softness of those leaves. The stalks, however, is too hard. Some might say crunchy, probably, but they could have cooked it slightly longer and still come out crunchy. The chef can cook the stalks first and let the steam cook it under cover for a minute or two longer, then dump the rest of the leaves into the wok to stir. That way the stalks will be less hard, and the leaves will s be perfect. Yes. I am picky.The seafood yee mee (brown noodles) is a disappointment. The noodles is chewy, the squid is chewy, the fish is decently fresh, but those soda-water soaked prawns looks so good that it actually taste bland. On the whole, it's the blandness of the brown sauce on the noodles. Probably forgotten to add salt, or msg, or both, or even a tad bit of artificial flavouring could have save it from such a disappointment. Alas.These three dishes is those standard Zhi Char dishes that almost everybody gets it right. Someone dropped the ball this time. Maybe its a different chef, maybe this chef has a lousy day, whatever.Average out a three stars from me @$30.50.",
