We then ordered 4 different pastas (Mushroom Risotto, Sun-dried Tomato Pasta , Carbonara and Seafood Linguine) and they all tasted pretty good actually!Ladies MUST have desserts so we had 3 to share. We ordered Red Velvet Deluxe, Bailey's Extraordinary and Double Decker Mud Cake. I appreciated that their desserts are not the run-of-the-mill type and good tasting too!With starter, soup, main, dessert and tea, the bill came up to about $30 per pax which I thought is very decent. Definitely a revisit when in the area.",

Crustacean bowl 2/5 - the description proved to be more exciting than the dish itself. The dish is basically rice, a LOT of cheese, and lobster bits sitting in a little bit of broth. Cheese was overwhelming, causing the lobster to lose all its flavor. Rice was in broth turned into a bad risotto.Strawberry dust drink 4/5 - not bad for $6. Basically a strawberry margarita with less acidity. Outside of the whole class is covered in chocolate powder. Cool, but impractical unless you plan on licking the glass and your chocolate-stained fingers.Ambience - fresh, light, modern. Nice.",

My girlfriend had the salmon ikura don which was creative and well done. Salmon was pink, the broth was a perfect fit to the rice. Great dish. I had the \"korean\" chicken. Very juicy and flavourful but the fries were a fail in my opinion. Soaked in oil. But overall filling and not a bad dish as well. The desserts were a slight letdown. The panna cotta lacked flavour. The berry was good and tangy but the jelly itself was lacking. I personally did not like the ice cream and our friends had the molten lava cake which was too sweet in their opinion. Decent place and great for a casual gathering with friends.",

    "text": "Arrrrg we had a strange dining experience last Saturday. Let's preface with the positive parts before the \"what the heck?\" moments surface.The menu at Platypus Kitchen is interesting but still chock full of sellers. By sellers I mean dishes you know the average Singaporean will like, think eggs benedict for brunch places, words like \"soft shell crab\", \"foie gras\" and \"truffle fries\" on lunch and dinner menus in Western restaurants. Platypus does away with the usual and instead peppers its menu with homemade pastas in sauces that sound familiar but aren't boring, crab cakes (which for some reason \"wasn't being sold anymore\") and ok fine, the ubiquitous truffle fries. The dude and I ordered off the set dinner menu: garden salads, I had the diablo crab & prawn bucatini (fat spaghetti basically) while he had the duck confit and we finished with the caramel cake and warm apple tart. The salads were fresh and had a wonderfully tangy dressing that was just delightful to eat. No, I didn't need to pick out brown or wilting leaves or sigh at how my salad was swimming in dressing. None of that. My pasta was fresh, cooked al dente and the sauce was light, full of flavor and supposedly egg based though I couldn't taste it (in a good way). The dude enjoyed his duck confit as well.So where did things go downhill? To start with, the waitress taking our orders seemed rather snappy and cut both of us off midway while ordering. For example, we told her our mains and as we were about to mention our dessert choices she said \"Oh so you're having 2 courses ah?\" as opposed to listening or perhaps a more genial \"would you like some desserts with that for a few extra bucks\". Then, the dude's duck confit was served while we were about 2 mouthfuls into our salads. Ummm..no. The waiter that served the dishes was also in such a hurry to get away that he literally put the dishes on our table and zoomed off. So here we are rushing to eat our food so it doesn't get cold. We finished it and we waited with our table cluttered with empty salad and main dishes. And we waited. It seemed like the entire crew was hanging out at the bar counter chatting and our desserts were no where in sight. When we finally got their attention and the desserts, I received the strangest \"frozen\" caramel cake. It was very cold and the sponge layer dry, such that I found it difficult to eat. Seriously me, the dessert lover rejecting a cake? Uh huh. I asked the waitress if the cake was fresh because it seemed stale and she said \"yes it's meant to be a frozen cake\". Alright then, remember NOT to order the caramel hunk of coldness. It's a pity because the dude's apple tart was great and we suspect the caramel cake, served with care, would've been great too.To end things off, while we were eating said desserts, the cashier came over and asked us to check our bill. We checked it and realized she was still standing there expectantly so we asked, \"is something wrong?\" to which she replied that she would like us to pay the bill now because she was closing the counter. *Throws hands in the air and headdesks*The cashier did the same thing to every other table in the restaurant (which was about 1/3 full and no one was done eating) and processed the bills in a batch. We were done eating at some point during that batch processing and had to wait. Again. For our check, which we were forced to pay before we finished eating. And to end things, we asked for a feedback form and objectively gave our comments. One of the waiters however, felt the need to read the comment form with the rest of the team BEFORE we left the restaurant or got our credit card back. The upside was the cashier came back and apologized and took 10% off our bill. The downside is I was just completely flabbergasted at why any service team would do that and I'm pretty sure my comments didn't make it to the management team.To conclude, I hope we got a very outlier experience at Platypus Kitchen because if this is the norm, I don't know how it will stay in business. Just because I don't enjoy being rushed AND ignored, I am not returning anytime soon even though I enjoyed the food. \u00a0To the service team, I've been a waitress before as a student for several years and it isn't hard to do your job at least marginally well. Take pride in what you do!",

I ordered a set - mushroom soup, pomegranate tea and Spicy 'Diablo' crab & prawn pasta.Can't go wrong with the soup and pomegranate tea is pretty rare in sg. It reminded me of Turkish apple tea somehow. Pasta is interesting: Egg tagliolini - looks like Chinese egg meepok (sorry for the lack of adjectives.) it was topped with crab claw meat and prawns. But crab claw meat had lotsa hidden garlic-look-alike inside so if you like garlic this might be ur cup of tea. Oh the spicy egg sauce is not so spicy.Aircon was on full blast so my pasta got cold real quick. Overall, the food taste decent but I still prefer traditional pasta. But come here if u wanna try fusion and variety! :)",
