    "text": "R K Eating House will satisfy your prata cravings 24x7 (literally). Their rendition of prata is flaky, crispy, and satisfyingly greasy (I don't find it too greasy like some of the other reviewers). Pair it with some curry, either with or without meat, and you have a great meal. I haven't had any of the other dishes here, but their biryani looks quite tempting (and is the Hyderabadi dum biryani style, if you're picky about what biryani you eat). Be aware that you have to specify exactly what you want (if you want curry without meat for dipping, be explicit) because otherwise you will receive the upcharged version of everything. We paid about $13 for four prata pieces, mutton curry, and bone-in chicken curry, which was quite filling as a brunch meal for two people.",

    "text": "Consistent food and drinks. One of my favorite prata shop to satisfy the prata and Maggie goreng cravings.I have been visiting RK House for years. Sometimes visiting them 3-4 times a week or even more!! It is opened 24 hours a day, I have visited them for breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper. Teh Tarik, Maggie Goreng and any prata options never fail to disappoint. They do have a wide variety of options, tried a couple previously and they weren't as good.RK house is also famed for its insanely huge Milo Tower, Bandung Tower and Teh Tower. These towers are usually spotted in club serving beer, as it is a halal establishment, they used them to serve local beverages instead. Great for large group!! Reason why I minus one star is for their sneaky habit of adding/upgrading your food to more expensive versions. For example when I ordered maggie goreng. The guy would ask if I would like chicken or mutton. You have to explicitly state that you want them plain. Adding the mutton/chicken usually cost $3-5, the portions are pathetic and they are often not tasty! Beware of this sneaky habit. Despite this naughty habit, we still love RK house very much.",

My conversation with the staff:Me: 'i want maggie goreng'Him: 'chicken or mutton'Me: 'chicken'Him: 'Fried chicken or chicken?'Me: 'Fried chicken? Wow.'Him: 'ok'Me: 'how much for fried chicken?'Him: '$7 something'Me: 'normal chicken?'Him: '$5 something'I ended up eating the pratas. My colleague ordered tissue prata & it came in a ridiculous size & shape. The doughs are far too oily, which leave me bloated the entire day. :( I said the food is decent because it taste ok. will not return so soon.",

Food is good and prices are pretty affordable except for sneaky staff trying to upsell their food umpteen times.Staff are dishonest & sneaky. They would ask you what kind of curry you would want with your roti prata, and when i said chicken curry, they would serve me a whole chicken with curry! Literally!I went a second time again and they tried to do it again. You have to tell them VERY literally. Just curry sauce, no meat!Service is slow and below average, so is their sanitary practices it seems. My utensils have food stains and i felt compelled to take them into the washroom for cleaning.",

    "text": "This place is like an institution in the Serangoon Gardens area. It has been around for decades and is a favorite spot for late night supper. It has the usual prata, briyani, Indian rojak, fried noodles, teh etc. I love the kosong prata which is squarish and is slightly crispy around the edges. The egg and onion prata is also good but it is softer and not that crispy so just order kosong (plain) if you prefer the crunch. The not so good thing is they do a bit of mis-representation. They will ask if you would like chicken or mutton curry to go with the prata. This is actually an additional order and is not an option for the complimentary curry which usually comes with prata. So just say you want the usual curry if you do not wish to have mutton or chicken curry. The usual curry has a bit of assam which I like as the tangy taste kinda refreshes the taste buds. The indian rojak is also very good with moreish peanut sauce which is not too spicy. The bee hoon goreng comes with bits of mutton and is yummy with hints of charred bits. Teh tarik is nicely pulled and is not too sweet. Since this is open 24 hours, you can literally have all your meals here.",

Let's be honest, it's still one of the cheaper places to go around Serangoon Gardens. But it is certainly not worth the wait especially if the food is not good. But if you want to chill over mediocre food and a teh cino or two and waste the night away, it is still a good idea. I'm all about experiences in life - your conversations with your friends and the atmosphere will more than make up for it.",

After the recent reno works, you look pretty fresh, and it's not like the previous look turned me off... it's more that I actually want to sit inside now, instead of always camping out at the alfresco seats, hoping for more ventilation.The food's just as good as before - there's the tandoor selection with delicious naan, or your staple myriad of pratas, and then there's the indan rojak... I'm a littl biased - I love the stuff at Suriya, which isn't too far away, but this place has a pretty good variety of offerings too, and since they are pretty busy, you know the food's fresh.It's a great place to come to for a late night snack, or if you've got Chomp Chomp fatigue.",

    "text": "RK House is a eating place in Serangoon gardens. While it has been popular for it's traditional Malay dishes such as mee goreng, nasi goreng, etc. It became even more popular after someone recorded a prank about requesting for pork dishes in RK house with the angry stall holder threatening to call the police. After gaming at a LAN shop nearby, my friends and I dropped by RK house for supper. Surprisingly at 4am, they still had a full menu instead of a reduced menu most restaurants would do during wee hours. I ordered a favorite of mine: nasi goreng ikan bilis (fried rice with anchovies) and a cup of iced milo. The dishes came fast and it was cheap ($3.50). The nasi goreng tasted up to standard and I enjoyed having it. My friends who ordered prata and mee goreng had a decent meal as well. Just remember: Do not ask for non-halal dishes. I'm sure the waiters have put up with enough of such jokes over the years already.",

Since returning to the US, I have NOT been able to find anything like it.This place gained fame after the \"NO POK, NO POK, I CALL THE POLICE, I TELL YOU!\" prank that two ah bengs played on the owner [see the picture on my profile]. The people here are nice, and the food is prepared very well. It goes without saying that this is a Muslim-oriented joint, so there won't be any pork on the premises - - don't be a wanker and go there asking for it.The Malay dishes are bomb, but I will typically eat no less than two prata kosong with curry in one sitting. I've also had the rojak, and I wasn't wild about it, but it looked very pretty. It's definitely an acquired taste, so maybe I've been away from SG for way too long, as I just can't really enjoy rojak or mee rebus any longer.People might argue with me that there is better prata in SG, but I SERIOUSLY disagree. The prata here are made of magic.",
