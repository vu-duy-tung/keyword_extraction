My pancake wrap with faux roast duck, peanut sauce and fresh cucumber and pear was delectable. Inexpensive and made me feel good about myself.They even have vegan muffins and tapioca cakes to go. I will definitely return for some more healthy and kind food. P.S. Cash only.",

    "text": "I'm usually a meat lover but something just prompted me to come here for something different.The menu, which features about 4-6 dishes, changes daily, but it always includes the brown rice set. First of all, we started with the Herbal Soup, which was really good. The light yet richly flavoured herbal soup combined many flavours and textures, derived from the various mushrooms and Chinese herbs which were braised for many hours.We also had the signature Brown Rice Set, which comes with side dishes such as fresh, crispy and crunchy long beans, slightly crunchy cauliflower with black fungus mushrooms and button mushrooms, tender strips of marrow green, saut\u00e9ed Chinese greens, and a simple salad with iceberg lettuce and carrot strips. Finally, we had the Braised Mala Noodles, which was an extremely satisfying dish - the noodles as well as the fresh mushrooms, tender carrots, crunchy lettuce and extra-firm tofu soaked up the slightly spicy braised mala broth, which was rich but not overwhelming.This is a great place to enjoy some really good vegetarian food; I'll definitely be back when I need a break from my meat-laden diet.",

    "text": "This place is really unique and I highly recommend it. It's like you're eating in someone's home, rather than in a restaurant. It was kind of confusing at first when I walked in, but I quickly figured out the menu is on the blackboard as you walk in, you decide what you want before you sit down, you seat yourself, get your own utensils, beverage/water and clean up after yourself. The food is delicious and super healthy, not to mention very inexpensive. Wish I could stay in Singapore longer to eat here again. I love the relaxed and friendly concept, as well as the food. I not only thoroughly enjoyed my meal but also felt like I did my body a favor by eating \u00a0the super healthy food here.",

    "text": "The menu at this family-run restaurant changes daily and there's usually a variety of between four and six dishes to choose from. Despite this modest selection, it's a popular place to head to for lunch because there's a comforting, home-cooked quality to each serving, and having a smaller variety means that each dish is cooked perfectly. Plus, the dishes are delicious without needing to resort to using processed ingredients and MSG. The owners are evidently practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism and there's even a cartoon image of a cheery monk at the entrance. There are pictures of the Dalai Lama throughout the restaurant and they also offer free books on Buddhist practice available to take home. As someone who is personally fascinated by the religion, this dimension makes me enjoy my meals at Ci Yan even more. Four stars because meals here are healthy, delicious and, in some small way, feed you spiritually as well.",

I usually like vegetarian food and was looking forward to trying this eatery, but the blandness and lack of value for money left me cold. It was $6.50+ for the brown rice set - with 4 small portions of mushroom/vege, long beans, bitter gourd, and some other green veges. I guess it's healthy, but I've had healthy food (e.g. thunder tea rice) which tasted much better.The owners are really nice, but I'm afraid I was quite disappointed by the food and will not be returning here, esp given the plethora of eateries in the Chinatown area.",

We shared two mains: a soba dish and a millet paella; and one red lentil soup and white fungus dessert for $20 total. The food was served very quickly -- I guess having a small menu allows for quick service and the owner was very friendly. Wish there were more of such places around the island!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have been regulars here since we moved to Singapore. In fact, to call us regulars is a bit of an understatement. We have come here at least 6 times a week for nearly a year and a half. This place is a true gem. Mrs. Seow's cooking talents are beyond belief, and Mr. Seow, who serves the food, is a wonderful, gracious and welcoming man. The food served here is best described as Buddhist (meaning no garlic or onions), organic, vegetarian. The menu is simple: each day there are 3-4 things written on a board outside. The first dish on the menu is always a rice-set, which consists of brown rice and side vegetables which change each day. The second item on the menu is a noodle dish, which also changes each day. Other items include interesting (and generally quite healthy) desserts. Some of my favorite dishes here are: Chinese pancake wraps, cold noodles, Sichuan noodle and thunder tea rice. You'll have to call ahead to find out when these will be served, but show up for lunch or dinner any day of the week and you can't go wrong. At $5.50 for the noodle dishes and $6.00 for the rice set, you can't go wrong. If food is medicine, then this place will add years to your life.",

    "text": "I discovered this place by accident about a year ago after my youngest daughter converted to a rigorous vegeterian diet. \u00a0Someone mentioned there was an obscure low key vegetarian place down on Smith Street that was very quaint and simple. \u00a0This institution has become my personal shrine, my Singapore version of Cheers, a place to eat healthy and clear my head (expecially after a night of drinking heavily and clouding my head). The staff are warm, friendly and entertaining.A few little tips to enjoy the place. Free seating. \u00a0Walk in and cheop a seat. \u00a0If it's crowded you may have to share a table. \u00a0Grab your own chopsticks and cutlery before you sit down. \u00a0Self service organic drinks in a fridge. \u00a0Ambience is solemn, cool and dark with a very peaceful \u00a0Buddhist motif. \u00a0There is a simple handwritten menu on a black board (both inside and outside). \u00a0Look it over and decide what you want to eat.The place is run by a truly wonderful family - Tony is the animated multi-tasking boss, waiter, receptionist, promoter and cashier. \u00a0His wife and son do the cooking. \u00a0It can get really busy as this place has built up a loyal following so you are likely to encounter a very animated Tony rushing around taking orders and asking you to wait. You may have to wait to pay your bill as well but he keeps the place lively with his banter to the customers. \u00a0Although the blackboard has only 5-6 dishes and some of them sell out, it's fare is always dependable, prepared well and healthy.. \u00a0Don't forget to clear your dishes and cutlerly. \u00a0Cash onlyHis heart is in the right place. \u00a0Lots of free literature on meditation lying around plus donation boxes for assorted charties (in case you get change after paying).Tony used to make incredible organic curry puffs but surprisingly pulled them. \u00a0Old Chang Kee breathed a collective sigh of relief.This place really chills me out and leaves a smile on my face. \u00a0I just hope it doesn't get too popular and spill out onto the new renovated Smith Street Open Air Hawker Area.",
