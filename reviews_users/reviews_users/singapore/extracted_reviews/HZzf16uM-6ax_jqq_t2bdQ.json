    "text": "This restaurant is right in the middle of everything. It's along the water, surrounded by many other restaurants. It has both indoor and outdoor seating (top deck) which really connects it to the whole marina environment. It has such an inviting, relaxing, yet hip atmosphere with a warehouse/outdoor cafe feel, complete with string lights, wood accents, and brick walls.We were greeted immediately, and they offered to switch our table closer to the air condition fan when they saw how hot we were. The food came in less than 15 minutes. We ordered the risotto frute di mare and their signature pizza- La Mattina Dopo (The Morning After). It came with a soft egg in the center- that's their thing! It was pretty good.Perhaps the best aspect of this place, the only reason that motivated me to pick up my phone and write this review- was the kindness and attentiveness of the wait staff. Not only were they considerate with reseating us, but when we inquired how most people ate the pizza with the soft egg, she explained that people either leave it for the end or break it and drizzle the yolk. \u00a0She went so far as doing it for us!The only reason why I did not award this place a full 5/5 was because I thought the risotto was a little undercooked (a bit too chewy) and the cheese on the pizza tasted as if it was under the warming lamps a little too long before it came to our table. But I still stick to my 4 stars-- all of the staff was so friendly and inviting, even though it was midnight when we came in. They're open til 3am!",

The inside was stuffy with the smell of oil and cooked food, another reason for me choosing an outdoor seat. Nice oak tables, great for Instagram flatlays. The fries and bruschetta was good, so was the oriental pasta - but not stunning nor irreplaceable. The vongole was a huge huge disappointment, I would recommend nobody order it. Great chill out place but don't see myself going back there anytime soon.",

Taste is good but not wow. The service is average and sometimes rather unenthusiastic. If you want a view, go up to level 2 where they have an alfresco bar. For dining, its still more comfortable to dine at Level 1. But the tables are close and sometimes a huge table may house 2 separate groups at the same time. So if you want a private place to chat, this may not be an ideal location as you will probably find yourself straining to hear your friend speak or having to talk over the noise around you.",

    "text": "The food over here has good standards. This is a Peruvian Italian restaurant and as staple dishes or chicken and fish with a Peruvian Italian twist. The style of Peruvian food due to the huge Asian influences on Peruvian food. Dishes to try would include their Pizzas, Peruvian Chicken, Steak fries with dipping as well as their Sausage platter. While I thought that nothing was particularly mind blowing, I felt that each dish was executed very well and tasted great. Besides they do serve $10 happy hour Belgium beer with a rooftop bar with an excellent city view.Conclusion:This is a new restaurant, located just outside esplanade mall. Nice ambiance and decor. As it is a new restaurant, \u00a0there are still a few issues such as staff training. But overall, an excellent place to have a quiet dinner and to hangout with friends.Do note that restaurant will only be open for F1 ticket holders from 19 Sept - 23 Sept, as they are located within the zone 3 & 4 of the Singapore GP Circuit Park. They will be accessible to the public from the 24 Sept, Tuesday onwards. Recommended for food, ambiance and friendly service :)",

Sounds good to me!We got 3 things from the Chicetti menu and one large pizza and it was more than enough for the both of us.Here's what we ordered:- Beef Antichucos - delicious! Loved the green chili sauce that came with it- garlic truffle fries - i love that it's chunky cut instead of the usual skinny fries. Couldn't taste much of the garlic though- Suppli - fried risotto croquette, it's my favorite out of the 4 things we got!- The morning after pizza - decent, but i've had great morning after pizzas elsewhere too.They serve peroni and mac's on draft, and they're $11 a pint during happy hour.The place has a nice decor and ambience too. Not too much seating, but maybe there was an outdoor component that i missed? They have a rooftop bar but we didnt get to check it out.Would totally come back again!",

Not bad, if your into this faux-handmade look. We were keen. We joined the queue ahead of us and dutifully checked in on the electronic queueing system cum phone number collection, receiving SMS-es, then phone calls from robot voices, all a bit impersonal, but okay if it helps, and eventually got ushered to a table. And that's where it went off track. The couples tables are so insanely close to one another that you're sitting closer to the guy next to you than the wife opposite of you. Not even in Singapore with limited space is this ok. Now, in our case, there was space. We had a table between us and the next couple, but barely sat down, the guy asked us to move over so our table could be joined to make room for four. Then we'd have been wedged between a couple and a group of four, with barely enough space to move between the tables. So, I'm not able to share about the food, because at that point we walked out. If you go there, please stand your ground, insist on a table with privacy, and if they don't accommodate you, just go elsewhere. Hopefully they'll get it eventually.",
