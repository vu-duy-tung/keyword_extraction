A simple bite for two easily goes over $50 (thanks to the all famous Service Charge and GST, which are conveniently not included in the menu).Otherwise a great place. Delicious German food and beers!It's mostly indoors with a couple of outdoor tables if you still prefer to sit outside.",

It comes with a cold potato salad which is average but not a big cold potato fan. We got the three trio with the chicken sandwich, burger, and salad. All really great taste 3 for 15$.",

    "text": "Brotzeit is a casual dining restaurant that serves German Cuisine.Frankly, I'm not a fan. Although the atmosphere and interior is modern and relaxed, the food and alcohol is just way too expensive! i simply can't justify paying over $25 for fried food, specifically German sausages which you can buy at the grocery and cook at home at a fraction of the price. The $18 grilled pork sausages with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut is probably the \"best\" value. The Weiner Schnitzel was $34, yikes, and I'm not even going into the price of alcohol. Last but not least, I hate restaurants that don't serve tap water and force patrons to buy \"still\" or \"sparkling\". Charging for tap water is fine, although this still peeves me as this is illegal in many parts of the United States (particularly NYC), but not offering it to customers is sacrilege. \u00a0Expect to burn a hole in your wallet and leave unsatisfied, if you plan to visit Brotzeit. Best to vist Werner's Oven on 49 Joo Chiat (Place 15 minute), if you want a eat at a German restaurant.",
