    "text": "This place is actually such a hidden gem. There is no cover fee to enter and the views were amazing. I got a pale ale for around $14 which was quite expensive but the views made it super worth it. Plus, the ale was brewed right in the bar--they have a huge brewery. You can see the whole MBS from here plus the flyer and almost the whole downtown core! The outdoor patio was absolutely gorgeous, but too bad there were no seats and the tables could not be reserved (FCFS). Still, this place is spectacular to bring a date to or to come alone for a beer and enjoy the views of Singapore!",

    "text": "I like coming here at sunset on a weekend because it's quiet and there's a great view without having to fight off the crowds that you'd get at One Altitude or on the MBS rooftop. The fact that there's a microbrewery on the 33rd floor of a building is pretty cool and I think some of their beers are quite nice despite not being a beer drinker at all.The beers and drinks are on the pricey side, as are the food options. However, since it's a bar with a view, it's not bad. And at least they taste pretty decent. Service is pretty non-existent but it's nice to be left alone. If you go early, you won't need a reservation but might get kicked out by 6 or 7pm.",

    "text": "Where to start...the view is incredible if you do end up finding this tucked away place. It can be difficult, but not to fear yelpers are here! You will find this snazzy restaurant and craft brewery perched high from the 33rd level of Marina Bay Financial Centre, Tower #1. My recommendation is to follow the pictures I posted if you are unfamiliar with the area.Looking out across the wonderful Marina Bay city scape is sublime and the main reason to have this place as a must see! Sure the alcohol and food prices might be high, but so are you taking in a view that can only be paralleled from a small list of places (unless you happen to work in these skyscrapers) and you can post some of the coolest pictures of a Singapore trip from here! One of the unique features is the in-house brewery itself which is decent, but the view is paid in the premium and it is a place I would be back again to bring a group out to enjoy the view as well.",

It put a smile on my face. The views are a hell wow yes; We will be here every night we have left!! Seriously the views and beers prices are not that bad considering the cool experience. \u00a0It's an ambiance to be part of. \u00a0Casual wear outside on the patio. \u00a0Inside nicer attire is preferred. Dinner I'd make reservations and ask for our door seating. It looked very popular. Desserts the cereal was the best. \u00a0The stout ice cream espresso. \u00a0The Coffee had a dark bold taste. If you're a coffee fan. This is the dessert for you. It was for me. I'm going to tout the beer again. I only had the stout but again the first sip I had a smile on my face and felt at home.",

We decided to check it out for some drinks and small bites on our last day in Singapore. Glad we did! Beautiful views of the Singapore skyline and great drinks to enjoy. If you're not a beer person, worry not. They have an awesome list of craft cocktails that you can choose from. The food was very good as well. The shrimps were probably the largest I have seen in Singapore. I would highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "[Directions: Go to Tower 1, then walk around to the left-hand side past Standard Chartered and you will see the LeVeL33 lift]I'm super-surprised this hasn't been added already to Yelp, with a good 50-100 reviews, as the views of the Singapore skyline from the balcony here are absolutely incredible. The bar opens around 11-30am, and has a wide-range of craft beers brewed on-premises. There are two separate parts to LeVeL33. There is a restaurant, which caters to well-dressed office people; and a bar on the balcony, which sees casual groups of flip-flop wearing individuals in shorts, sunnies, t-shirts. I'm reviewing from the latter point-of-view.The balcony is just a great outdoor experience with a ~240 degree-view of Singapore. You can see visually from Fullerton Hotel -to- The Esplanade -to- the Marina Bay waterway -to- The Float -to- The Art Science Museum -to- MBS -to- Gardens by the Bay -to- Ships in Singapore Strait -to- the other towers of Marina Boulevard (and slightly beyond).The beers are interesting and tasty. I tried the IPA (quite strong and heady) and the Lager (much easier drinking) and enjoyed both. Given the location, the drinks were expensive, but this was to be expected, and I cannot fault them on pricing.However, where there is a disconnect to the bar is the lack-of-food options. There is a food menu that accompanies the drink menu, but whilst the bar opens at 11-30am, the bar food is not available until 2-30pm (I think this is because they do not want a clash with their restaurant). This 3-hour window of difference between drink-and-food ensures that if you are interested in a session you'll have to basically go elsewhere because you'll be drunk well before 2-30pm arrives.This is exactly what our crew did (there was 8 of us). We were 3-4 drinks in, and needed food to accompany any further alcohol, and since there was a significant wait ahead of us, we decided to leave and go elsewhere despite this location being fantastic.Service *appears* to be patchy. Before arriving, one of our team was reporting that service was very slow, whilst upon my arrival I had no trouble gaining the attention of servers whenever my beer was running low. So this might be something to think about when it gets busy (it wasn't very busy when we were there).I feel like this bar is a must-visit, even if you just come up for 1-2 drinks and enjoy the view (take a video or a pano) then head back down. For tourists it's literally 30 minutes of your day to capture an incredible view of the city and won't cost you an arm-and-a-leg like MBS does. NB: LeVeL33 has its own lift in Tower 1 of Marina Boulevard, and is located to the very left-hand side past the Standard Chartered signage. You cannot miss the LeVeL33 signage, once you see that, the lift is located in the alcove next to it.",
