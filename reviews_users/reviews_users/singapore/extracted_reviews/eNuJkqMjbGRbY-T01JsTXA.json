    "text": "Came with my family to discover the restaurant very quiet on a Sunday afternoon. Only another family other than us. We ordered many of their signature dishes and though there were not many people ordering, the food took a while to come. Lucky for us, we were enjoying a lazy Sunday lunch so we were in no rush. We saw later that the kitchen was only manned by 1 chef so maybe that's why. The food is actually not bad, some were even very good. The not-bad ones were:1) Cashew Nut Chicken - a tad spicy and served over a basket of yam!2) Grilled Pork Collar - not much taste on it's own but the accompanying dip was too sour for my liking3) Okra - normal nice4) Pad Thai Seafood - texture ok but a tad too sweet for my likingThe good dishes were: 1) Basil Stir-fried Pork - I didn't have any as my eldest girl ate them all and did a \u00a0when I exclaimed \"no more for me?!\"2) Crispy Fish Skin - super crispy and laced with salted egg = Yumz3) Olive Rice - nicely fried and fully flavour, another favourite of my eldest girl4) Pandan Chicken - good marination so the meat was tasty and nicely fragranced with pandan5) Prawn Cake - not the factory made ones, you can tell from the bits of prawn in the patty. Was the right kind of crunch6) Red Curry with Roast Duck - this is an interesting dish with mild lychee sweetness and red curry spiciness in a good combo! 7) Soft Shell Crab Salad - didn't see much of the salad but the crispy soft shell crab made up for the dish8) Tom Yam Potaek - not a big bowl but the ingredients were fresh and the soup not overly spicy that it'll kill your tastebuds. 9) Street Omelette with minced Pork - fluffy egg fried with minced pork and onion strips! Let's just say the kids ate through the first one so fast that we had to order another!",

    "text": "The hunt has been on for the best Thai restaurant in Singapore. It just got tougher because I was recently in Phuket, where the bar just kept getting higher! Folks Collective was pretty good. We started with happy hour wine at about $5 per glass. They were out of the Cab/Shiraz blend, so we opted for a Cabernet. \u00a0They were out of the bacon wrapped shrimp, so we gave the prawn cakes a try. They tasted similar to chicken nuggets with the honey dipping sauce. Brought me back to middle school! Pretty tasty, but definitely not Paleo. The mango salad was pretty tasty. Hubby thought it was a bit fishy for his tastes. We ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and green curry with beef as our main courses. Both were pretty tasty and at a \"Singapore spice level,\" which isn't too bad for us foreigners. Now, if you go to Jane Thai, you'll want to request mild if you are faint of heart. :DThe service was good and the ambiance on the patio was great. Cool breeze and covered walk area with white Christmas lights made for a lovely meal. Officially, I would rate this place at 3.5 stars. I went back and fourth between the two ratings, but due to the fact that they were out of two of the things we tried to order, I opted for the 3. The food was good, but the hunt continues for \"to die for Thai\" in Singapore.",

    "text": "Whoooooo buddy, there is some good Thai food up in this joint!One of my colleagues took me here for lunch, and I've been in love ever since. I usually judge Thai restaurants by their Pad Thai, and Folks Collective's is pretty solid. The flavors and textures are all there, and I love how it has copious amounts of crushed peanuts and chili flakes. I could eat it for days! I also recommend ordering their signature FOLKS wings, as they're crispy, juicy, and everything you want in life.I decided to spread the good word to Miguel by bringing him here for dinner, as he works nearby and we were craving something different. (Okay, Thai food isn't \"different\" but we have high standards for this cuisine and so far, nothing's impressed us.) Now that he's been evangelized, he brings his colleagues here for lunch at least once a week. For lunch, he always orders \"Set A\", which comprises of chicken wings, seafood tom yam soup, and jasmine rice.Lunch is very busy, and because you have to settle your bill at the register after your meal (as opposed to settling it at your table), be prepared for a long queue at the cash register. But dinner is a lot quieter, and they have a cocktail list worth checking out. A great place to go when a Thai food craving hits while you're in CBD!",

    "text": "I'm a fan of this place already having been here twice. I hope someone will challenge me for Dukedom over here.The food is moderately reasonable for a dinner venue ($8-12) for a dish. I've taken a liking for Thai food recently and I'll continue to keep a lookout for good Thai food. There seems to be a dearth of such places given the popularity of the fare (Singaporeans love spicy food)We ordered a few appetizers (and pardon me for not knowing the exact name of the dishes) - a crab cake dish that came in round bite-sized portions and another dish of chicken wings which had the visual texture of General Tso's chicken (those from the US will definitely know what I'm talking about). When I mentioned this to my friend who also spent time in the MidWest, his face visibly fell. LOLNevertheless, the wings turned out pretty juice. The texture was juicy with sweet sauce coated on the surface. I ate more rice than usual pairing it with the chicken.The crab cakes however, were underwhelming and we didn't finish it.For mains, I ordered Tom Yam while my friend opted for Thai basil minced meat. Didn't get to try his dish but he pretty much finished up the meat. The Tom Yam was spicier than usual and the soup was filled with all kinds of ingredient. It was very filling after scooping up all the prawns, fish and other ingredients in it. Serving size was just right too.The place of this location is great for office workers - right at the entrance of Nankin Row. I'll surely come back for the green curry and take back my Dukedom should someone steal it from me in the meantime :)",

Food arrived quickly and was delicious! We had the thai green curry as recommended by Amanda L. It was food with the rice and they used the proper thai eggplants as well. We had the Tom yum poteak which was great! Tasted like how it does in Bangkok. Since I can speak thai, the thai waitress recommended the clear Tom yum over the creamy one for authenticity. Chicken wings was nicely marinated and the vegetables tender and tasty. Drinks are reasonably priced and 1-1 before 8pm for wines by the glass! This will be my new hang out place for some good food and help cure my homesickness without breaking the bank!",

    "text": "Dropped by for an early dinner to catch up with a friend. The place is a bit inconspicuous and I walked by twice before asking a stranger. Embarrassingly, I was standing right in front of the restaurant, ha.Yelp led me here and the reviews don't lie. The food was all around delish. We started with the appetizers platter which included a good array of their favorites.The green curry with chicken had a good spicy punch and was overall tasty. Pad See Ew was a bit bland but not bad. In retrospect, I noticed there was a pile of salt and chili flakes served with the dish but didn't think to salt the dish myself. Is that the more authentic way of serving the dish?Service was prompt and friendly likely due to low occupancy rate when we had our early dinner at 6:30pm. Around 8 or 9, I noticed the place fill up and get quite busy even for a Tuesday night. Sat outside on a perfectly mild and balmy evening so can't comment on the decor.Read some bad reviews about lunch service and can understand as lunch anywhere around this area is just a mad house but for an early dinner, I can't wait to come back and try more of their dishes!",

    "text": "This place just recently opened last week. It has a nice vintage-yet-modern vibe to its interior. You'd feel like you stepped back into the 60s with gramophones and feminist cartoon posters lining the walls. On one end of the restaurant, the walls are lined with small drawer akin to those found in traditionally Chinese medicinal houses which are used to store herbs. Wooden frames and glass windows double up as dividers & deco pieces that segregate different areas of the restaurant. Surprisingly, the restaurant is much bigger than it appears to be from the outside. It can comfortably sit 50 people (my estimation). Definitely large enough to throw a party for family, friends and some more! The fusion of east meets west interior deco mimics its food. Although predominately Thai, its cuisine definitely has some western influenced as well (eg: it's amazing chicken wings! cooked buffalo wings style but marinated with sweet Thai chili sauce). The Food1. Pad Thai (Seafood) - Good 2. Green Curry Chicken - Love 3. Tom Yum (seafood) - Good 4. Chicken Wings - LOVE!!!5. Lemon grass drink - Meh. It tasted like someone mixed lemongrass aroma therapy oil with water and added ice.The service Surprisingly, despite opening night, all out dishes came super quickly. The only exception was the chicken wings which took forever to come. Granted they offered 1 free wing with every \"like\" on facebook which might have caused some bottleneck that night. In the end, the chicken wings came late (after we had finished all our other dishes) & a tad bit cold which was a pity because it was really well marinated. Nonetheless, it tasted delicious and I would highly recommend it as a must-try! Overall, they serve up some pretty decent Thai food. I'll definitely be back for the ambiance and chicken wings again.",

    "text": "Pretty new on the scene but already creating a bit of a review and PR buzz, it's fair to say I went into Folks Collective with some expectations and fortunately they lived up to them! Reasonable prices with most dishes under $10 (before service charge and tax), I would have to recommend the wings (actually mini drums), the sambal prawns, the kang kong and the kati icecream. But all the other dishes we sampled that weren't singled out above were good too! We spent $45 pp at dinner and ate LOADS alongside a glass of vino so I'm sure you could get away with a lot less.Decor is probably 'vintage asian' with a splash of mismatched cafe funk. It works though and I really liked the atmosphere and feel. Some advice to the restaurant though... items described as appetizers/starters should be served before those items described in the menu as mains. Although hey, we're in Asia and I should be used to the haphazard delivery of foods by now! But despite the restaurant only being half full, they were super quick to serve all the food (which we were super quick to eat) and then horribly slow to clear the plates and bring the bill so we just sat there with empty plates (and empty glasses!) - there's definitely an opportunity for them to get more drinks into their patrons if they space out the meal a bit more!! I would definitely recommend this place for a casual tasty bite at a reasonable price.",

Instead of addressing \u00a0obvious bottlenecks in the kitchen, service and at the cashier, the floor manager continued to usher people into the restaurant, and was more interested in getting customers to use their new tablet app for ordering. It was a 20 minute wait before we were served our first dish, another 20 minutes before the 2nd arrived and another 10 minutes wait before the 3rd and 4th was served. Last to arrive, ironically was our appetiser of fried Thai fish cakes. Despite multiple inquiries, our last order of pad Thai with prawns never made it our table. Having run of of patience we cancelled our order, unimpressed , unsatisfied, and undoubtedly never coming back again.",

Folks Collective also needs to change their billing system - right now people have to go to the counter after their meal to pay, and it takes forever and a queue forms, especially during the weekday lunch hour. Perfect for dining n' dashing, actually, because no one really keeps an eye on you (they're understaffed, my food took ~20min to arrive).",
