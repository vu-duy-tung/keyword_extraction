If you want a comfortable seat to watch the show on Monday, which starts around 1130pm and goes on for about 2 hours, you should come here for dinner and then stay on. The food is good, typically American, complete with burgers and Tex Mex. I like their fajita platter best. Almost any dessert is good too. Everything on the menu is a little bit pricy for a casual diner, but rightfully so since Hard Rock has established its name worldwide and is allowed to charge accordingly. If you're a fan of coconut and rum, their Pina Coladas are a must have. They are unbelievably fresh and one is never enough for me. They have a shop near the entrance selling Hard Rock collectables and sometimes-overpriced memorabilia.",

I had a Cobb salad and the chicken was really dry and didn't taste fresh. Hubby ordered a burger with no bun and no cheese, but it came out with cheese anyway and reported that it was \"really bad.\"The saving grace of our experience here was the second act. Thank heavens this review wasn't based on the first act. I think someone called in a favor for act one to play. They definitely didn't meet the Hard Rock Cafe standards of the US. Act two on the other hand was phenomenal. So far he has played some Elton John, Marc Cohn, Fleetwood Mac, Eric Hutchinson and some other top 10s. I'm a fan and if only reviewing the music (at least from act two), this review would have been a 5.Tip: free wifi login is hardrock/hardrock",

    "text": "Ah, the days of underaged drinking. During my younger days, and even now, I had a clear preference for dinner and drinks as opposed to clubbing. Enter Hard Rock Cafe, an adolescent haunt of my JC days. Or nights, to be more accurate. We would down jugs and jugs of potent Long Island Tea, munch on nachos and burgers, and shout above the throbbing music. Good times. When we turned 18, we had our birthday bash there, a little to the dismay of the wait staff who then realized what had been going on. Years on, the interior is still as cramped and garish, music still as loud, nachos still as good, and Long Island Teas more diluted than I remember. The menu remains great - it's hard to pick a bad dish, and servings are generous. The burgers are a good choice, although then again, it is rather hard to get burgers wrong! I'm rather partial to the mushroom & swiss burger myself, and it comes obscenely juicy. Prices as always are on the heftier side, but it can be ameliorated by limiting the alcohol, though you really shouldn't. Stumbling down the stairs of HRC has to be one of my fondest memories yet.",

It share 2 - 3 people very satisfyingly!When you buy the mocktail or cocktail, you can pay extra to have it served on the signature HRC mugs/cups and then get to take the mug/cup home as souvenir. Gimmicky and expensive but I guess if you're a tourist, you'd fall for it!The ambience is pretty loud and gets even louder when the house band starts playing after 10pm, not a good place for a quiet date but perfect for pigging out with friends!",

After waiting anxiously and seeing two other tables finish their meals and ours never arrived, I called to ask what's happening! That was when they realised the order had been missed out. I'm not sure how this could happen but it was a big letdown for me. I make it a point to visit a hard Rock Cafe in every city I travel to because the quality of the meals and service is quite dependable. I must commend the staff for a quick recovery as they were full of apology and did their best to try to make up for the mistake even offering to put one of the meals on the house. Aside that lapse, the overall experience was positive, the ambience was great, clean and staff were courteous and prompt. The food was also great as usual feel. Sad I can't rate it higher than 3 stars cos of my experience.",

The burger was absolutely flawless and so were the cocktails. As a frequent Hard Rock Cafe eater I have to say that this wasn't the best overall Hard Rock experience that I've had. The food was perfect but the rest was lacking from their usual standard of quality.My main complaint is that the usual music videos playing on the TVs around the restaurant were all replaced with a repeating video of the engraving of the Hard Rock logo onto to a solid rock. It looks cool the first time you see it but after it played for the 100th time it just gets super repetitive and annoying. As a replacement there was live music. The guy singing was great but the sound was just too loud for me and I couldn't talk to my family anymore which was annoying. However, the songs he sung and the way he sung them was so good that I'll give it a pass.For a restaurant called Hard Rock Cafe there was surprisingly almost no Hard Rock music there at all. The place was also a lot brighter than it usually is. I don't get why the Singapore restaurant is so different from the usual Hard Rock cafes but it was striking. Overall, i was a bit disappointed. The food was amazing though so it wasn't that bad. Just a lot of little things that could have made the whole evening so much better so easily.",

The food was good. I ordered a burger and it was pretty big. It was also very messy. I like a good burger with good amounts of toppings. They even have a good serving of bacon on the burger. They had a good selection of local beer. The bar tending staff was very nice and really took care of me. Very friendly. I'm glad I found this place. I have been craving a burger for a while now.",

It was a great family night out.THIS one, the food was mediocre (much of which was the same items, just \u00a0prepared more poorly), one of our drinks was undrinkable, and the overall environment was pretty lame. The one exception was the pulled pork, so take hope from BBQ.Skip this one, go to Sentosa, have a great day out, and then finish up at HRC if you want a retro rock and roll good time.",

Like all Hard Rock Cafes there is the typical menu and the food was the same as in other cafes. This location had just completed a renovation to their upper Mezzanine level. Overall a great experience. Store had a lot of good selections for souvenirs along with limited additions pins. This year they added for the first time ever Chinese moon pies with a collectors pin. Very delicious. Recommend you stop in if you get the chance. Will be back if I find myself in Singapore again.",

For example, the booths have older 50's Cafeteria Tables and the vinyl seating is extremely worn and ripped with passing coming out. The staff was just \"ok\". I waited a bit before anyone waited on me. The I had 3 different servers helping. One was better than the other two which just made the serving \"ok\"The food was excellent. The Satay was very good and the Texan was even better. But you have to expect that this is a HRC and not a gourmet burger joint.",
