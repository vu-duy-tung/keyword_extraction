    "text": "My go-to Brunch Place in Singapore.I love the food and ambience here and being tucked away near the CBD means there are no crazy queues during brunch time. Hate to share the secret with everyone but this place deserves high mentions. In particular the brunch bread basket (2 chocolate pains, 2 warm croissants and 1 freshly baked baguette) with a side of 3 jams and french butter is my absolute favorite. The hot items are consistently consistent and delicious but i end up getting the omelette each time due to me being vegetarian. I also love the A la Folie mocktail that one of the owners make. Its some strawberry, mint, basil, sprite concoction that is amazing!I've brought a number of folks over to the restaurant and they've all loved the place. Havent had a chance to go during non-brunch hours but the menu looks very meat centric so I may give it a pass. I'll be back continuously for brunch though.",

The meat was pretty standard fare, but the escargot were quite special, served in shell and with generous helpings of pesto.Seems like a lot of the customers were regulars, a lot of families with kids in tow. Very friendly service, servers knew most of the regulars by name.My only quibble would be the wine list - good selection, but quite overpriced.",

    "text": "I've been a little sick of fusion food so I wanted a place with traditional French food - no surprises lurking around my plate for me!I had the escargot to start, and I felt it didn't have enough garlic in it. Tasted more like a green pesto with heaps of parsley spooned on top of escargot. Don't touch the metal plate they're served on - it's HOT! I burned myself while shifting the plate.Next up was scallops on a bed of asparagus in a cream sauce for my main. My four scallops were seared BEAUTIFULLY. I could find no fault with the dish. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes, and yes, they were flawless too.My friend had the lamb, and while they didn't ask him how he wanted it done, it came sliced and was done rare. Beautiful way to treat a great piece of meat (I'm not being sarcastic). I love lamb done rare, but if you don't, be sure to mention it!Dessert for me was the Cr\u00eape Suzette, which they lit up in front of me, with blue fire dancing on my plate. I wish they'd put more alcohol so the fire would char some of the sugar off! My crepe came smothered in a very sweet Grand Marnier sauce. It wasn't too bad but it was too sweet for me. My friend's rhubarb tart was disappointing too, with some crumbly tart AND rhubarb paste under it. HMMM. I guess they don't do desserts very well here.No fear, come here for everything but dessert, wash it down with some Billie Salmon champagne, and go for dessert elsewhere. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Great little brasserie in trendy Tras St area, a little slice of France in Tanjong Pagar. Unpretentious, but a place you could dress up for. Dimly lit, but with plenty of noise and conversation. \u00a0Service is relatively prompt. Waiters clipped and efficient but friendly enough. We ordered a salmon tartare($24) to share for entree, which was a good thing as it was a very generous portion, more than adequate to share. Avocado, lettuce, dill and capers made for a very fresh and tasty starter. My main was ribeye with bearnaise and frites ($48). When it first arrived it looked \"meh\", but a quick slice open revealed it was cooked to perfect medium rare done-ness. Nicely seasoned and with a good 'crust'. The bearnaise was EXCELLENT and I had to try hard to not smear More onto my steak and end up with a heart attack. Frites were pretty standard, but generous. My partner had St Jermaine scallops with spinach and porcini. Very tasty, well cooked scallops on a bed of spinach with what I think was confit garlic. Unfortunately we left no space for dessert, but I want to try that cheese plate....A special mention for the bread. Very, very good bread. Definitely will be back to try something else. Maybe the salt cod...or the rabbit....or the pork stew....or the lemon sole......or the welsh lamb....",

    "text": "Last week, coworkers and I had the pleasure of having a business lunch at Brasserie Gavroche, an upscale French Bistro on Tras Street. \u00a0(Its sister restaurant Cafe Gavroche is directly across the street). \u00a0This was my first visit here, and I am now a huge fan. \u00a0The food, the ambiance and service were impeccable. \u00a0 The shop house's bright dining room is simple and elegant with french themed decor. \u00a0I'm interested to see how the dimmer lighting at night transforms the space into a different feel. \u00a0There's a full service bar near the entrance. The staff were on point. \u00a0The presentation of the large wood framed menu was impressive and there's a remarkable amount of choices in each category. \u00a0I selected the Ribeye Steak Frite ($48) and it was AMAAAZING! \u00a0The 300g portion of beef was perfectly seasoned and seared - crispy on the outside and perfectly rare on the inside. It's up there with Luke's or Morton's quality and one of the best steaks I have had in Singapore. \u00a0Served with a generous portion of perfectly cooked fries and bearnaise sauce. After we cleaned our plates and several glasses of wine later - \u00a0we ordered a selection of desserts for sharing. \u00a0Too high on life to remember them, but I had a bite of each and they were top notch (See the photos)The Good: \u00a0A nearly perfect lunch. \u00a0The Ribeye Steak Frite was delicious. \u00a0The staff was friendly and helpful.The Bad: \u00a0It's too pricey to be my new go to neighborhood lunch spot. \u00a0I would not be able to resist ordering the steak frite each time. \u00a0I must work harder to get a promotion and a raise.The Verdict: \u00a0Yes. Yes. Yessssss!",

    "text": "For some reason, my family wanted to try French. So I did the usual search, read reviews and decided to try this restaurant and I must say, I am not disappointed at all.Located on a street just off the main thoroughfare of the Central Business District, the restaurant boasts a fine patronage of diners, mainly Caucasians and occasional locals. As you step into the place, you immediately get a feel of the Parisian air. We ordered the usual French fare; traditional onion soup, smoked salmon salad, shredded duck confit and the lobster and seafood \u00a0with bechamel sauce and the escargots done in burgundy and garlic butter.My daughter who had the onion soup exclaimed that the bowl seemed bottomless, so you could imagine the portions of the servings. My favorite was the lobster and seafood dish. The cream was not too rich. There was a generous helping of the seafood. Personally, I felt that the escargots could do with a little bit more of the garlic butter, nonetheless, what I had was pleasant enough. The service was impeccable too. The French butlers were attentive and non discriminatory, unlike others, who tend not to want to serve the Asians.This restaurant certainly has my vote for good food and good ambience. I will definitely make a second visit.",

    "text": "I've been here twice, once for lunch and a second for dinner. Skip lunch and come straight for dinner!! Order the steak! Order the tartar..delicious! I don't know about you, but eating a large chunk of steak isn't usually how I do lunch--I'm a lady after all. I save my bloody meat thirst for dinner, complemented with some fine wine, and \u00a0Brasserie Gavroche definitely delivers. I dined with three others and we all enjoyed our meal. Well, I didn't enjoy my entree but I fell in love with the wine and dessert! We ordered the tartar, flank, steak, and veal. The steak was the star of the show--juicy and earthy due to the grass-fed cow from Ireland. Who knew Ireland produces such good steaks?! The next star was the veal. The description of the menu does not do it justice. Though I only had a small bite, it was everything I dreamed of but more! \u00a0I would personally pass on the flank and veal. The veal was my dish and I knew from the first bite onwards, I had made the wrong choice. Others in my party enjoyed it, but for me..meh. Though I had ordered the veal medium rare, it was tough nonetheless. I like my veal to be extremely tender and I really couldn't taste the difference between the veal and the flank. The flank was good, but nothing compared to the steak and tartar.For dessert, be sure to get the baked Alaska with brandied cherries! Once it arrives, they set it on fire in front of you! Hot damn! The chocolate is rich and dark and draws you in with the mouthful of brandied cherries. The Alaska is a decent size so I definitely recommend sharing it among friends. Brasserie Gavorche had a great wine list and for the price of the meal ($60 for food and wine), I couldn't have asked for anything better.",

I would say that this is the dish to try at Gavroche.Decor and ambience is a 5 star. Would definitely be coming back here.",
