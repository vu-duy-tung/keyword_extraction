My only gripe is service. Granted, it was a busy evening, but I didnt like the feeling of being rushed throughout my order. Overall a good meal, would go back on occasion for a celebratory meal perhaps",

    "text": "Was taken here on a public holiday for lunch. We arrived at 2pm so we didn't have to make reservations, but they close the cashier at 3pm so we were hurried to pay for our meal. Apart from that, service here was pleasant and attentive.We had the goose wings, braised duck, spinach with 3 eggs, and jellied pork trotters. The pork trotters were cold and smooth, with a generous amount of meat and skin within, but not much fat, which is good. It came paired with a mild but moreish chili sauce.The goose wings came in the same sauce as the braised duck, and I got a bit tired of that. I was loathe to deal with the wing bones so I ate more of the duck. The braised duck came with a garlic chili sauce, and the gravy spooned on rice makes it a very home-style meal. The duck comes with tofu underneath, so one doesn't get meat overload. The spinach with eggs was done well, but it was too much for the both of us. The eggs were cut in perfect squares - loved the attention to detail.I finished off with dessert; yam paste. The yam paste here isn't the greasy pork lard version, but instead is a mound of taro, with a slice of pumpkin on top, and a light sugar syrup drenching the dessert. Not heavy enough for my palate, but still delish. I expect most grandmothers would be agreeable to this place for family meals. Yum!",

    "text": "Serving up some really authentic Teochew cuisine (or so my relatives say), this restaurant is part of the Jumbo Group franchise so expect slightly higher prices. I'd reserve it for a nice family occasion as this restaurant has a great tablecloth banquet-style setting. You do get a 20% discount for being a Jumbo member though. The final bill (~S$30pp) was not unreasonable considering we were all stuffed with leftovers.I liked that they start off each meal with traditional teochew tea as a palette cleanser, which really sets the mood for the rest of the meal. Unfortunately their signature braised duck was sold out when we arrived, so we ordered the braised chicken instead, which was still quite delicious. We also ordered other signature Teochew dishes, shrimp ball (\u867e\u67a3) and liver roll (\u809d\u82b1), and the latter was surprisingly very tasty! Each person should have two pieces -- the first to whet the tongue, the second to fully savor it. We also ordered the traditional dried scallop and vegetables, which was a thumbs up! Fried yam is also of course a must. For dessert, they have the classic Or Nee (\u828b\u6ce5) or yam paste with ginko nut and pumpkin, which was well-balanced and not too sweet.Like a typical Chinese restaurant, don't expect much of service; don't hesitate to the wait staff whenever you need something.",

    "text": "Authentic Teochew taste, love the steamed promfret which is fresh, tender and in appetising soupy sauce Teochew style. The liver roll, drunken prawns and oyster egg are also incredibly tasty, iconic Teochew dishes. Favourite amongst all is the Teochew cold crab which has succulent and amazingly sweet meat, though there could be limited stocks depending on the season - best to call in advance to reserve the crabs. Finally get to round off the meal with Teochew yam paste, which is a flavourful sweet dessert, that has a good balance of smooth texture, oil and fragrant taste - probably one of the best around.",

    "text": "This is a place for Teochew food and you can see many families or towkays (businessmen/big bosses) dining here.There are only two dishes which I really like over here - oyster omelette and the yam paste with pumpkin dessert. The other dishes are quite standard or typical of such restaurants. Good old Teochew food. The cold crabs are nice but I prefer the version at Asia Grand. The fried yam stick coated with sugar was also pretty good. The fried ee mian to dip with sugar was somewhat of an acquired taste. I did not really fancy it. Likewise for the seafood fried vermicelli, I thought it was a bit heavy on the Maggi sauce seasoning. This is under the Jumbo group, so if you have the Jumbo card, you can get some discount. Service is spotty. Some days they are good and on other days they can be quite slow and lackluster. But as with old school Chinese restaurants, you are not really there for the service, you are there for the food.",

    "text": "interesting enough everyone raved about the oyster omelette at this restaurant but i just didn't get what they described. my plate of oyster omelette was quite charred and the oysters were miserably small and hard to find in the dish. A family member having eaten this dish before on his first visit raised his concern about the lack of quality of this dish but only to be faced with a very cold reaction from the manager on duty. the manager on duty turned and faced another table even before our conversation was over. His aloof attitude was not appreciated and maybe it would work better if he switches to the entertainment industry since that kind of bad boy attitude garner more fans in the world than do anything for hungry people at a Teochew restaurant.but i do want to praise the older lady servers who were attending to our table. they did their best and really was genuine in wanting to provide good quality service. they were the ones more concerned that our dish of lobster e-fu noodle was never served and still unseen even after 15 minutes of the second notification. There's one dish that i really enjoyed. it was the cold crab. fresh and sweet; each crab was $30. the lobster e-fu noodle that finally showed up after we cut the birthday cake and had desserts was pretty good; the lobster was fresh and succulent. the price tag for that dish was $138. just a note: there is no parking validation.there are private function rooms for use if you have an event, complete with karaoke systems.",

They serve it roasted in savory Chinese spices, and they actually remove the layer of fat and serve up only the crispy skin with a thin piece of succulent meat under it. How's that for a healthier version of roasted suckling pig! Yummmmmm.....The rest of the teochew dishes are all generally good. The fermented bean steamed chicken is a great, succulent and flavorful. Their rendition of pomegranate chicken is actually served steamed, with a medley of chopped vegetables and sea cucumber cutely wrapped. I would give it a 4.5 stars, but since it is CNY, 5 stars it shall be.Jumbo members get 10% off, and reservations necessary! Make one pronto and go eat some pig.",

Being somewhat a fine-dining restaurant, the prices of the foods are quite high. I do not mind paying high prices for good food but the food at Chui Huay Lim were pretty mediocre. I guess I expected more for the price I was paying so the food was quite disappointing to me. Service was dismal. The staff were pretty rude, and some did not even understand English. They were also very slow and we ended up having to cancel some orders because they took way too long to serve the food to the table.We got the braised duck, which was not bad but not great either. The clay pot tofu we ordered was drenched in gravy that was way too starchy. We also got a serving of black pepper beef which was tasty but again, not impressive.Overall, I find Chui Huay Lim Teochew Restaurant is pretty overpriced. While the decor depicts a fine-dining restaurant, their food betrays their identity, and that is quite a pity.",

I was told that the management went to several well known Teochew restaurants before coming up with the concept and menu, and the result is great!Food : Steamed pomfret, hee peow (fish maw) soup and orh nee are de rigeur orders when in a Teochew restaurant and we are nothing if not ardent followers of foodie tradition. The pomfret was fresh and steamed to perfection. Soaked in a light tasty broth with hints of tomato, mushroom and ginger, it was excellent. The fish maw soup with crab meat was tasty and rich in flavour, a great substitute for sharks fin soup. We were feeling festive and so we also got the Teochew style roasted suckling pig ... pre-order recommended. We had heard it was one of the restaurant's specialties and for good reason! The crackling was crisp and the pork wasn't too greasy. The cold crabs were quite good too and we really liked the orh nee. The texture of the yam was just right and it wasn't too heavy and cloying. With the addition of pumpkin and gingko nuts, it was the perfect ending to a Teochew meal.Ambience : Modern Chinese decor, very clean layout.Service : Prompt and friendlyGood for business lunches and family celebrations.
