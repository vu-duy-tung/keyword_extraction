It started with a selection of breads and French butter, then an amuse-bouche. The next four servings were: (1) cold angel hair pasta with caviar & truffle, (2) langoustine, (3) pan seared duck foie gras, & (4) French river salmon, all followed with the main course of Roasted Duck with spring turnip. Then dessert, of course. The service and ambiance could not be better.",

    "text": "Two Michelin star French cuisine in Orchard. Serves traditional French cuisine. We went there for lunch which was a relatively good price for fine dining (~130/pax). The courses include: amuse bouche, cold soup, salmon tartare, langoustine, duck and dessert. We find the food overall good but not spectacular, and frankly underwhelming given my high expectations of a Michelin star. The food just felt a bit too safe. Yes, the techniques and quality of ingredients were top-notch but the meal was just lacking in creativity to become particularly memorable. Favorite dishes were the langoustine (fresh / simple but really well-cooked) and the baba dessert (not too sweet, rich but balanced)Service was excellent, a true Michelin star level service. Large and good quality wine selection. Sommelier is quite helpful and gives good recommendation on the wine. They also gave us free macaroons to take as souvenir.",

We did the Tasting Menu which was perfectly executed with every dish revealed to us from a perfectly withdrawn dome - old school French style. We loved the drama as you don't see it much these days. The service was also top-notch as we felt completely doted on by our multitude of servers. The standouts on the menu were the challen duck (cooked perfectly!) and the langoustine with olive oil emulsion - divine! The menu didn't disappoint and if you want an old school fine dining experience while visiting Singapore, Les Amis fills that bill. :)",

Opened since 1994, they are one of the longest standing fine-dining restaurants in Singapore. During my week-long trip to Singapore in January, I managed to secure a lunch reservation at their establishment.Les Amis offers several dining options with seasonally crafted menus which ranges from 65$+ to $295+. We opted for 'Le Menu Tasting' which showcases 6 dishes for $155 per person. It's comprised of one cold appetizer, two hot appetizers, two main courses and one dessert.Dining at Les Amis was a lovely experience. Their angel hair pasta signature dish was to die for. The whole team takes a lot of pride in their work and I commend them for it. If you're looking for a straightforward contemporary French fine dining experience with a high level of finesse, Les Amis is the place to be.",

We came here for Valentines 2016 and were pleasantly surprised with a simple and sophisticated decor, which we thought was similar to Jean George in New York. We opted for the Le Menu Classic course, reasonably priced at $185/person. The flavors of the dish, the service, and the atmosphere fell together perfectly (nothing to nitpick about this pl) and we left a happy couple by the end of the night. Will return!

They have 3 set menus from $150-$300 and several \"to share\" dishes. We each ordered the $150 \"Decouverte\" menu which included:Steamed Blue Crab and Hokkaido Sea Urchin on Lobster Custard with Fennel Foam - Rich and deliciousCrispy Cornouaille Langoustine, with a mini caesar salad - DeliciousSeasonal Corn Soup with chives - served piping hot with a few caramel corns on the side, rich but balancedHungarian Charcoal-Grilled Pork Rack With Carrots Confit and potato puree - The pork was super tender, the puree impeccable and the carrots delicious. My co-workers opted for Wild Scottish Salmon, one confit and one tartare.Dessert was Dark Chocolate Souffle with Tahiti Vanilla Ice Cream -ice cream was the most vanilla-ee I've ever had.I felt very satisfied with the meal, and felt it was actually good value despite the cost. A special note, they have FOUR kinds of butter and 3 kinds of bread: Baguette, sourdough and focaccia. \u00a0The mini baguettes were incredible. The butters are smoked (delicious), seaweed (salty), spicy and salted. I tried each and they were all good in their own way, perhaps the best butters I've ever had. Service was great, they explained each item since I didn't remember what any of the courses were. The wine list is as thick as a dictionary but they have affordable wines and wines by the glass. The restaurant is pretty small and intimate, and their wine cellar is a digital glass walk in safe-room. I will certainly return next time I come to Singapore.",
