Usually shaved ice melts into unappealing liquids after awhile but milk tea shaved ice simply melts into ice cold milk tea. Topped with cashew nuts and tapioca pearls, I was really glad I made the choice.The ambience is great, super chill place to study or just chat. Free wifi to boot!Will be back!",

    "text": "Was surprised to learn that this was a Korean joint but didn't make much difference to the food they served.Came here specifically to try their coffee which was ok for a franchise - ranked similarly to that or Starbucks or Coffeebean. Nonetheless, I simply loved their Green Tea Latte or the Caramel Latte which might be a bit sweet for some but a great pick-me-up for me.Used to be opened till 2am but it was recently revised to 12am.Usually I would choose to sit at the extended siting area outside but beware of student campers who would be there all day and deprive you of a coveted seat.",

The Green Tea Bingsoo was delicious and filled with red bean goodness. The only problem I had with this place was the lack of open table as many students were occupying more than one table to study.",

Hey it's a Korean chain, did not know that but makes sense. They play k-pop in the background and this place is usually packed when I walk by with students hanging out or reading. It was totally empty on a Saturday morning.I ordered a large Americano (gosh I miss brewed coffee...why is it non-existent in Asia/Australia??? Long Black? No thank you!) and a cinnamon pretzel. I waited 10 minutes, TEN MINUTES, there were 2 workers and 1 of me waiting in the WHOLE place. Errrr. I don't get it.I like the idea of this place and the fact that it's right downstairs from my place but man they gotta get their coffee and service right or they won't make it.",

During my last visit, i ordered the pretzel set which costs $7, cheap in my opinion as you can have a drink and pretzel snack. Cafe also has power sockets but it'll depend on your luck since that is quite in demand. if you purchase any food int he cafe, you'll get the free wifi on the receipt. Not too bad.",

Their coffee sections are not as much as Starbucks or Coffee Bean, but the environment is definitely less noisier than most cafes out there.It can be rather crowded at times, and because of its increasing popularity, there are more people checking out Toms N Toms. I love their free Wi-Fi and their pretzels! The price is rather reasonable, and I just can't resist bread, or anything to do with flour for that matter. Students, you can consider Toms N Toms to mug instead of hogging the tables at McD and other cafes.",

    "text": "Was just exploring Icon Village when I accidentally found this big space at the other end dedicated to this coffee place called Tom N Toms Coffee. Turns out that its a Korean franchise. The place has got seating inside and outside. Except outside is also air-conditioned within an enclosed space!Was there on a saturday and it was really nice and quiet for a weekend. The best thing is that it opens til late. There were a few students studying here when I was there, it is quite the perfect place to study undisturbed! Their specialty here is the pretzels and they looked irresistible in the menu pictures that I ordered a stuffed pepperoni pretzel. The ordering system is interesting to say the least. You get this electronic tag after you order at the counter and make your payment. You sit down and wait for your tag to light up and beep and then collect your food and drink from the counter. It's pretty troublesome to go to and fro if you're seated out in the enclosed space, you have to keep opening doors. But I suppose that's forgivable if the food and drinks are top notch. But it's really not. The coffee I had was uninspiring, for a store that calls itself a coffee place, they've got a long way to go. The pretzel however was quite a delight - it was served hot with the cheese all gooey and melting and the dough was soft. The only other thing I remember was how pricey the piece of dough cost!Final verdict: Great for studying! Though I don't think the store is an advocate of it.",
