Ive eaten at all of their outlets all over Singapore too!My favourites: egg, otah, chicken wing, ladys finger and sambal belacan. Add chilli and cucumbers! Tbh, the aunties here are too busy moving the line, taking orders and making money. But honestly, which food vendor isn't? I like the food, so even if they're trying to rush me, I'll come anyway.",

    "text": "With my most recent visit there, there is a constant line once it is open. I got there about 20 minutes after it opened and there was a line all the way out to the corner. By the time I left, the line was outside around the corner. That being said, I feel the queue speaks for itself, it is a popular place for locals and people to eat. And that is why it's surprising that there are only 6 reviews on Yelp thus far for this location of Punggol Nasi Lemak, and with pretty low stars. The queue moved quickly. By the time you get close to the food, there is someone who asks how many people and for Togo or eating there so be on your toes for that. Then when. You get to the front someone takes and gets your order of what you want, then totals the price, then passes you off to the next people who you pay. Quite efficient and a speedy process. The turnover is quick but the line continues to be the same length. The meal: Nasi lemak with a drumstick and wing, green beans, an over-easy egg, and a luncheon meat (spam) (because other people were getting it). Big meal, but wanted to try it all. The Nasi Lemak, flavorful, good coconut and pandan flavorThe fried chicken, I preferred the drumstick over the wing. The drumstick was more juicy. This fried chicken ranks as high in the best fried chicken that I've had and especially in awhile too. Crispy, tender, juicy, and not drenched in oil like some places. And the turnover is so fast in the place, that you can see them bringing out more fried chicken so it is fresh :)The over-easy egg was a nice addition. As a dish as a whole, the green beans and the sambal was a great balance! Next time I'll ask for more sambal sauce. So, Overall, a really great meal of flavor, juiciness, and yummy goodness. I'd definitely return. Tip: If possible, get there early. Although, like I said, the queue goes decently quick so it's fine if not. Tip2: I believe the sign said 530pm-330am. Nice that they are open late for a late night snack if that's something you're craving at a late hourTip3: Many people were getting out of cars and then one person would wait in line while the other would park. Or also saving tables too.",

    "text": "Based on the reviews here, I must not be a nasi lemak connoisseur!A few of my more 'local' friends dragged me to this place kicking and screaming. Well, not quite kicking and screaming but there about. How can I, a Tanjong Pagar/CBD native, journey to the heartlands...and for food??? What has happened to me?? Will the food justify my Uber price tag? The four of us arrived here around 10 PM for supper and were quite puzzled because we expected a line. There was no line. Nonetheless, we ordered one plate to share in addition to a few other plates from various stalls. By the end, we had to order another plate of this nasi lemak. Because it was friggin good! \u00a0A friend, from Indonesia, raved about the rice and the fried chicken. I thought the rice was fabulous--super fragrant with just a hint of coconut. I'm not a rice fan, but the nasi lemak here definitely hit the spot. Fried chicken was pretty good too--though I'm not a great judge since I don't like fried chicken. Will I come back again? No. Simply because I don't crave local food. If I ever do and have enough dough to purchase a car, sure. But for now, mehh...not worth an Uber.",

    "text": "To the ignorant reviewers below, who has no knowledge about culture, especially the one who said this is not a \"traditional\" nasi lemak place because it \"lets you customize\" (whaaat?! No idea what you talking), listen up. This is Chinese nasi lemak. The type with just a little fried fish, small fried fish, some egg and rice is Malay nasi lemak. The Chinese have settled in s Singapore for over 200 years and by 1850s, became the largest race of people in singapore and in that time, have 1) brought over the southern Chinese food from their hometowns in Fujian, Guangdong, Chaoshan (Teochew), Hainan 2) invented new dishes (Satay Bee Hoon), 3) made modifications and created our own versions of food and made them very different. Chinese nasi lemak comes with a huge plethora in a buffet like spread of many dishes like string beans, big fried chicken wings, luncheon meat, even pork luncheon meat and pork lup cheong. The only thing one would find that was taken off the Malays is the rice cooked with coconut milk! In fact many of the dishes contain pork.",

You pick the items you want and they charge you for the individual items. I had the otak, fried egg, lady's finger and fried chicken and my dish came up to ~ $5. Very pricey!The rice is not fragrant and all the other items I ordered are meh.Line is long although it moves really fast. They have figured how to make the supply chain efficient with each person having a specialized role.All in all, this place is quite disappointing.",

    "text": "Maybe it is because my mum is a good cook, or that the nasi lemak I usually like is of a ridiculously high standard. I expected more from Punggol Nasi Lemak, especially with the ridiculously long queues every night. It is a good plate of nasi lemak, but nothing extraordinary, nothing very different from any other less known nasi lemak stall, and definitely not worth the high prices paid for this plate of nasi lemak. Their rice is tasty, but not fragrant enough. Their chili is nothing great to speak of either. They offer a wide range of ingredients, which is probably one of their few positive points. Their only saving grace is their nicely fried chicken wing. Tasty and juicy, it was the main highlight of my meal. Well, my point is that the punggol nasi lemak is overrated. Their nasi lemak is not great, and their prices are pretty unreasonable. Any home-cooked one can easily beat its standard.",

    "text": "Even though the standard has dropped somewhat over the years, the food here is still great. I like that there is so much variety you can choose from! I especially love the fried stuff. I can't get enough of it. Even though it's been deep fried, the food doesn't have that awful old oil taste. The fried chicken wings are still great, especially if you have the great fortune to be there ordering when they've just fried up a fresh batch of golden, crispy, succulent wings. If they're getting to the end of their batch, I normally wait around for the fresh batch to be served. Heh.The rice is fragrant and fluffy, good enough to eat by itself or with the awesome, free flow sambal ikan bilis. It's also nice with the lontong curry sauce drizzled over it.However, I must admit that the prices they charge are a little high for comfort, especially since this is nasi lemak we're eating here. It can cost me up to $10 for a (slightly overloaded) plate. The kopitiam the shop is located in is horribly lit with overly bright fluorescent lights that bring out the flaws in everyone's faces. Not very clean, but there are lots of seats available. Avoid coming here during dinnertime as the snaking queues are just ridiculous. Come for supper instead! It will be easier to find parking as well.There isn't really a parking area here, you'll just have to drive around and park int eh general vicinity. Some people even park alongthe main stretch - and that is a big no-no.",

Seeing how there are many great Nasi Lemak stalls around SG, it takes quite a bit to hit the unami spots of foodies in SG. This one didn't quite make the mark for me.The Nasi Lemak served here is more \"Chinese\", reason being is that you get to pick from a variety of dishes to match with your coconut rice. The rice of Nasi Lemak is the key factor to a good dish, the coconut rice here was alright. Above average at best but nothing especially striking. The dishes were decent but expensive. Was expecting a lot more from them. You might want to try it for yourself to decide but I don't know if you'll want to spend time queuing for this.",
