    "text": "Tiong Shian Eating House is conveniently located right inside Chinatown on New Bridge Road. The place is just 5 minutes walking from Clarke Quay. Food here is tasty, authentic and reasonably cheap. Frog porridge has an undoubtable sweet taste. The frog is chewy, moist and juicy. We really love to drizzle extra sesame oil on top, which obviously gives an interesting twist to the taste. Century eggs porridge, in addition, blows us away with its creaminess and fragrance. Apart from being a perfect treat to have on a rainy day, a bowl of century egg porridge is also great for people who are sick, as it's wholesome and hearty.Recommendation: Frog porridge and century eggs porridgeRead our Singapore Food Guide: thecoupleeats.com/singap\u2026",

    "text": "The flurry of 4 star ratings for this place really puzzles me. Came here with a friend on a Monday night at 10pm (they apparently close on alternate Mondays so we got lucky).We got a bowl of century egg porridge with an added raw egg, a pot of gongbao frog, plain porridge, and some raw fish. I really wasn't impressed with the century egg porridge, because I only tasted the soy sauce they liberally put, and it was watery and insipid. The raw fish was reasonably fresh, with chilli, lime, ginger; nothing spectacular, and the frog was just... meh. I don't know how much this place costs... but any price is too much for this (lack of) standard(s).",

The portion is pretty generous and the gravy is not too spicy. For a tender tongue like mine that cant tolerate too much spiciness, this is great. If you want a kick for your tastebuds, just ask them to up the intensity of the spiciness! Add a plate of raw fish to increase your appetite as the freshness of the fish doused with the acidity of the lemons livens up your tummy.Fresh, flavourful and warm. One word - YUMS.",

I was somewhat confused. I guess they are edible, but somewhat disconcerting to feel the texture on one's tongue, nonetheless2. $8.80 for claypot gong bao fish slices - pretty gd sauce, wasn't very thick sauce, but went well with the plain porridge3. $5 for you choy (sauteed veg) - shanghai greens, apparently. Mom buys these veges from NTUC regularly, very easy to steam. Anyway, came with nice sauce! Garlic soy mixture of some sort.4. $0.60 per bowl of plain porridgeI wasn't super-wowed, but it's a fairly good meal for the price. It's kind of hot there though!",

    "text": "There is only one place to go for supper in Chinatown and that is Tiong Shian. It is so popular that there are always cars and people clustered around the corner coffeeshop even at 11pm. Having had work in the area before, its one of the few decent food options available by that hour. Word of advice though for those who drive, good luck finding parking. And when business is brisk, good luck finding a table too. As the name states, they are famous for their porridge. Every possible kind with every possible ingredients / toppings is available here. Called me a traditionalist, but I often go with the staple Pork porridge with century egg. I like the portion sizes especially after a long day at work or play for you clubbers out there. As with most supper porridge stalls, they also serve frog legs porridge. And for those of you who irk at the thought of eating kermit, I will tell you the same thing my parents told me when I was a kid squirming at the very same idea, \"It tastes the same as chicken, only much nicer!\". Its really true as frog meat is lighter and sweeter in texture, and the flavours goes into making the porridge sweet and light too.And for more variety sake, they also serve a very good standard bbq chicken wings and also raw fish (chinese style not japanese sashimi) to go with plain porridge if thats your cup of tea.",

    "text": "Famous porridge, parking pains.This is probably one of the most busy porridge places in chinatown. Located on a very visible part New bridge road. Tiong Shian porridge centre is never short of customers.As you would expect, you have a good variety of choices, century egg with lean pork meat, fish, pork innards, pork liver, cuttlefish, prawn, frog legs... you can have your porridge in any way you like. Prices here are reasonable and the only downside is the possible long queue and the impossible parking woes you might have. Plenty of cars park illegally along the street, order up and then leave. Keep an eye your vehicle if you choose to do so. Fines are issued quite regularly here.I order only a couple of things on the menu regularly and that's the clay-pot gong bao fish slices or the clay-pot \u00a0gong bao frog, the fish porridge, pork porridge and occasionally the raw fish (nothing special).I have to say, if the queue is really too long or if there isn't enough seating space, don''t waste your time. Just go to the other porridge place next door called 'Sinma'. The claypot gong bao frog there is very decent and there's hardly a queue there ever.",

Alas, it's so popular (and parking in the vicinity so scared) that sometimes, there's a long queue for the tables. Fortunately, they have recently expanded their premises into the shop at the back (in addition to the unit above) which helps with crowd (but not the car parking). Their porridge comes in many different variety - pork, fish, chicken, cuttlefish, etc. The porridge is in fairly large portion too. In addition, Tiong Shian offers a large assortment of side dishes that you can order to go along with your porridge. You can be spoilt for choices (the regulars, however, will always pick the same stuff that they like).",

Yes, the porridge is good, but the side dishes are the ones that really stand out and make the trip to Chinatown worth my while. I always order a plate of their bean curd, vegetables and raw fish. The bean curd is generously sized and nestled in a delicious sauce, whilst the raw fish is simply prepared with lime, chilli and ginger. I don't think I could ever get tired of either of these dishes. It can get pretty crowded, and you may have to wait a while for tables on a busy night. They have more tables at another outlet besides the small provision shop, so take a walk down that way if the main area on New Bridge road is full. To order, you will need to make your way to the cashier, so don't expect to have anyone come by and ask what you'd like to have.",
