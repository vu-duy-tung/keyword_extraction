It seems that a lot of people are more interested in drinking than eating but that also meant our glasses were always topped up and we didn't have to fight or queue for the popular items as you would at other buffets. Don't recall how much it was as my friends took me out but I would definitely recommend if you are looking for value for money and a more classy buffet.",

    "text": "So this is going to be my shortest review ever ! I think everybody's heard enough about the food and the spread and the ambience already. And I'm not going to disagree with any of the other reviews about the edge, because the food, the spread and the ambience are just as good as everybody says it is. I just want to say something about service leadership at edge. In reviewing the service at the edge, I will say one thing: the team in charge of service wants you to have a seamlessly extraordinary experience. In fact, I'll go one better and \u00a0say that they seem to take it personally!Here's just one example. We ordered a dish of curried chicken that was part of buffet but off their usual menu. This didn't arrive, and it truly wasn't a big deal given all the food \u00a0we didn't end up trying; just not humanly possible or healthy to in my opinion. \u00a0The concierge not satisfied with more than just the usual apologies, \u00a0made sure to leave us with a small token of appreciation. It certainly cost them next to nothing but bought my admiration and loyalty forever. Service at this level may be something that is usual stateside, but so very unusual in Singapore and so very refreshing to see!! \u00a0 There will be those who point to the less than responsive service of the floor staff, but I'm happy to overlook it if the service leadership team is so committed to good service that they take it personally. \u00a0If this is the attitude of leadership, slow service staff and another practical details will work themselves out over time. \u00a0I will continue to give them my custom as long as that is the case! \u00a0Kudos concierge team at edge!!",

    "text": "Been here around 5 times as my family loves this buffet. The quality and variety of the food is consistent. Decent food with a variety of the usual-seafood, dim sum on certain days, various Singaporean dishes including laksa, chicken rice and other foods that can be found over Singapore. Despite the raving reviews, I found myself kinda disappointed with the spread-nothing much exciting or special that made it worth its price. What makes this worth a trip would be the dessert bar, filled with ice cream, more than 10 types of cakes, pudding and all including meringues, cr\u00e8me brulee, pandan cake, nyonya kueh, waffles and more. The service is good but not exceptional. Overall, this buffet might appeal to those hungry for specific types of food in mind and are particular about the quality. Not a personal favourite but probably worth a try if you're in the vicinity or staying at the hotel",

    "text": "This is a nice international buffet located inside the Pan Pacific Hotel (near Suntec) on the 3rd floor. The food quality is generally quite good and there are tons of different options, like Indian, Japanese, Western, seafood, and local foods. The Indian dishes were a bit too salty on my visit, but the seafood (lobster, crab) was great. My favorite dish was the wagyu beef, which I recommend highly. This was a dinner visit, but I have also attended the breakfast buffet, which has a great variety of selections. It is pretty safe to go at any time of day. Also, while buffets are generally not associated with quality food in the US, you should not be turned away from this place. It is a classy and tasty buffet. Although there is plenty of seating space, it can fill up, so it is safer to make a reservation a day or two in advance. We visited on new year's eve and the staff members were very energetic. There were also different dining options for the holiday, so you may want to check on the different offerings based on when you plan to visit.",

    "text": "The food was good, don't get me wrong, but I'm rating this place 3 stars because I think it lacks value. I think there was way too much food to try, and not enough tummy space. If you are looking for a good spread for dessert, this is not your place. It's more of a main course kind of place.I came here for dinner. They had an impressive spread of seafood, including lobsters. There was an array of Indian foods, which were quite good, and Chinese food (I liked the soup), Western styled dishes, and grill etc. I can't quite remember everything. Everything was cooked well. My only issue is that you can try maybe one bite of half the items, and you're done with dinner. I think I would have been happier with a smaller spread with a smaller price tag.Lastly, we came here for work with a guest. Their credit card machine was not working, and they asked us to wait a little while they rebooted. We ended up waiting for 30 min, which was really embarrassing. I think they should have let us pay at the next door restaurant, or use the credit card machine at the reception. Given the size of the bill, there was no way we could have carried enough cash to pay for it, but that way the only option we were given for payment.-------------Update: March 25, 2017We are doing a buffet tour of Singapore, and came back to the Edge for lunch last weekend. Lunch price was $48, but we used a UOB credit card for a 20% discount. I think they have restructured the buffet because I recall it used to be more expensive (although I checked during the holidays, so there might have been additional charges). I believe the addition of local delights means that the food is cheaper to make, so they were able to reduce the price and still please the crowd. I was here for dinner the last time, so I can't tell exactly what was changed because of the meal, and what was changed to deal with the price. The grill station is gone. They had a teh tarik station. There was a pizza station, a pasta station, kueh pie ti station, Indian, and local/Chinese station. There was chilled seafood (mussels and prawns), and sashimi. There was a fried banana station, and maybe a kaya toast station (although I didn't see anyone get it), and a bunch of local kuehs at another station. Yeah, they definitely replaced a few things.The dessert station is improved since the last time I was here. I particularly liked their ice cream -- they had 5 flavors. There was a yuzu sorbet, a blueberry yogurt, Thai milk tea, and matcha, and I can't remember the last one. I didn't like the yuzu. The blueberry yogurt was okay. I liked their Thai milk tea ice cream. The waffles were pre-made, and red velvet flavored only. I skipped that. The cakes didn't blow my mind. They had a bunch of kuehs, and Portuguese egg tarts. \u00a0With the change in the variety of food, I think the buffet is now better value (less variety, but also lower priced). I think the quality of the food wasn't spectacular, but acceptable. I might bump this to 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "the food was decent. I don't think it was outstanding in any of the criteria we judge buffets by: quantity, quality, variety, and service - but it's good enough to return to, just to differentiate itself from the main players (to my mind: melt, the line, and straits kitchen).they have the usual roundup of local food, japanese sushi and sashimi (the latter is good and very generous - ask for the salmon belly, which is available via request and not on display). the cold seafood seems serviceable (they have oysters and crab legs, which I know many people are into), but my favorite was definitely the prime roast - pink, tender, and full of flavour. pity they don't serve au jus.I also want to warn you that their so-named barbecue is in fact an indoor table-top grill, where you place your orders for various cuts of meat. not what I'd named a barbecue (and I'll refrain from judging this insidious clever marketing) - and also not very good. highly by-passable.there's a good spread of dessert, with a chocolate fountain, artisan-looking chocolates, and pretty cakes. skip the waffles though - anaemic, and rather biscuity, these are serviceable only with the ice cream.not bad enough to warn against - but if you're into stuffing your face, I'd recommend you to melt (still my favorite) and the line (which is an oldie but decent-ee).",

I'm not even a buffet person, preferring to just sit and relax and have things brought to me, but I wanted everything they offered, so it was better for me to just go get it.All the traditional western breakfast foods: pancakes, waffles, bacon, omelettes, sausage, etc. They also had a cold bar with yogurt, fruit, cheese, and cereal. The bakery was amazing, and I had pretty much everything they offered at some point during the week. There was also Indian, Malay, Chinese, and Japanese. A coffee and juice bar allowed for plenty of beverage options as well. The cost was high but included in my room package, so it didn't bother me at all.If I go back to Singapore, I'm staying at Pan Pacific and enjoying this buffet every morning.",

    "text": "Located on the 3rd flr, Edge is a restaurant inside the Pan Pacific hotel. My review is based on service during breakfast hour, as breakfast was included with my stay. Similar to other hotels in Singapore catering to international travelers, edge offers diners plenty of choices during breakfast service. All stations are buffet-style, serving foods common in Europe/American (sweet pastry, croissants, baked beans, eggs, bacon & sausage, etc.), to Asia (congee, dim sum, noodles soup, fried noodles, fried rice, naan, yogurt, sushi, etc.) to deli & cheese station, fresh fruit station (pineapple, watermelon, papaya, dragon fruits). They also have a couple stations offering cook-to-order dishes, like omelettes, or fish-ball or wonton noodle soup. The servers are fairly attentive in clearing the empty plate and refilling tea or coffee. But they're not overly intrusive (i was able to enjoy my meal without being interrupted every 5 min). I think for juices, you have to full those yourself at that juice station. You gets a small orange/black card on the table that tells the staff whether you \u00a0just getting more food or you're done. So you don't have to worry about someone accidentally clearing you table.As mentioned my breakfast was included with my stay, so I don't know how much breakfast is at the edge. That said, food was good, service was good... If I have to pay out of pocket, I would prob pay around $25SGD... Simply because there are a lot of local places you can find similar food for less money, though may not be at one convenient location. Or you have a huge appetite that you require buffet-style feeding. :)",

Even as you walk in, the ambience is wonderful, with a spacious seating plan. There's a selection of window seating, booths and regular restaurant seating available, with the food stations spaced out rather evenly throughout the restaurant. There's a large selection of cuisines available, with a small variety of dishes representing each cuisine. Unlike other buffets, these dishes are prepared in small quantities to ensure the quality and freshness of each dish. There's also an absolutely wonderful selection of fresh in-season fruits, cheeses and desserts - I highly recommend the red wine chocolate! Service by the staff was also pretty good - there were smiles all around. My brother also managed to get a birthday candle for the slice of cheesecake he picked up from the dessert counter which he had decorated with more chocolates from the counter (it was my birthday). Would definitely recommend this place :)",
