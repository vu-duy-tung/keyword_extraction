    "text": "I have been walking pass Angus House umpteenth times but never has the chance to step in until just this year. It was a celebration meal for a birthday and finally we had the chance to explore Angus House. Angus House is quite easy to locate as she is on the 4th Level of Takashimaya, next to the Toys / Children Department .I quite like this open concept kitchen part of the restaurant whereby we were able to take a click preview of the chef busying in the kitchen.Internally is well lited, under the spacious and romantic lights, environment makes it cozy and relaxing. With attentive servers around, I would say that their service is prompt and smiley.It is perfect place for a first date. Also, it is recommended to make reservation and secure a seat.We were there for steak but to make it a meal with appetizer, soup, salad, bread and dessert, we topped up $15 each and find it quite worthy.Appetizer was a big piece of salmon with flaky bread stick and sweet sauce.Reminds of my Mos Burger Style of Salad and immediately I know they are common as its Japanese! Greens was crunchy with cherry tomato, Japanese cucumber, corn kernels, cabbages and dressed with roasted sesame sauce.We had the escargot as our sides. Well baked with herbs and butter, served sizzling hot. I'm not really a fan of these shells but I think the style of preparation were rather fragrant. Escargot - $18You can still hear the sizzling and bubbling effect of butter together with escargot when they serve to the table.Close up of EscargotEnvironment was quite cold and just right with a warm bowl of calm chowder.Calm ChowderIngredients in Calm ChowderThis is not the usual Western Style Steak I had. In case you are not aware, Angus House is mainly serving Japanese Style Beef Steak as well as pasta and the type of serving may not be what you have on mind if you are thinking along Morton's Style.The 200g Sirloin Steak comes in a sizzling hot plate direct from the kitchen in Medium-Well doneness as requested. A piece of savoury herb butter and slice of lemon was placed on the steak, as the heat rises, the butter melts accordingly. Steak was definitely soft and texture was friendly with the knife.Sirloin Steak 200g - $60While the man had a bigger portion of 300g Steak from the Rib Eye at Medium doneness. Similarly, the steak was juicy and tender just like I had my Sirloin.Rib Eye Steak 300g - $78Desserts have option of Cheese Cake or Tiramisu. Since we are having 2 sets, we opted for both and ended our dinner with sweet endings. Cheese cake came with a very moist biscuit base and was light in taste, not too cloying. I love the Cereal and the dash of raspberry sauce and cream by the side.dCheese CakeTiramisu was light and tasty coupled with honey melon, dragonfruit, mint leaf and strawberry. It was real good and in fact I dont mind having another piece if they do offer.TiramisuAt least I can strike off the To Visit / To Eat from my list after visiting Angus House. The quality of food and service are commendable. I won't hesitate to recommend my friends here if they want to try Japanese Style Beef.",

On weekdays there is free tea/coffee but not on weekends.Starter: Threadfin fish on a bed of mashed potatoSalad - nice too.Best bun! Soft and warm.Cream of mushroom soup - good, not heavy.Sirloin steak - good, just as I had ordered. Far better than the one at Wooloomooloo.Corn on the cob - Super lousy, tasteless & hard.Guava mousse cake - never had this before but it's nice. Their most popular dessert is tiramisu. The other choice was ice cream.Overall a very good meal.Reasonably priced for the quality.",

We always get the set since it's a great deal (you'd get an appetizer, soup, salad, dessert to go with your mains), and make a special request for the corn soup and extra sauce for the steaks. If you like Japanese style pastas, you should also check them out. Their sea- urchin and scallop spaghetti makes for great comfort food.",

    "text": "The Food: We got the set for all of these mains (below). The set includes a salad, prawn spring roll & breaded prawns starters (the prawn spring roll came out a little cold though) , soup (lobster chowder - love it!) for an additional $10. 1. Spaghetti salmon row & abalone set $33- A fusion of east & west! The salmon row and abalone was topped off with seaweed strips :) - Overall ok. 2. Chicken grill $38- Loved it! The chicken was so tender and succulent! They grill it and serve it on a hotplate. - A generous portion was given too. 3. Tenderloin steak (medium well) $57- The beef was not over cooked, definitely juicy which was good. I had mine medium well so I was happy they didn't over cook it like most places. - Portion wise it was small. Service: Good. Very efficient (even on a friday night). Ambiance: A colonial yet modern & clean cut setting (very korean drama serial). The servers had to wear a french-maid like outfit (not the sexy kind, mind you) but it was still a bit strange to see the restaurant have its staff wear such uniforms. I can't imagine the servers like it much? I guess it contributes to the overall theme of the restaurant? Though I would stil eat there even without the french-maid uniforms being worn. It's definitely about the food & service. Tip: this place serves THE BEST BREAD! It's freshly baked and each person gets one. The bread is fashioned like a cube with a little top cap. When you pull it off, you can see the steam escaping from within - that's how fresh it is! :) delicious.",
