    "text": "I am super proud of Spring Court! \u00a0This is a legacy restaurant that has taken great pains to reinvent itself and the dining concept to keep itself relevant! \u00a0The stalwarts of the original menu, the dishes that made Spring Court a household name are firmly ensconced in the updated contemporary menu. Things you have to have: \u00a0Fresh spring rolls (popiah). There are many excellent renditions of this all over Singapore and to be accurate, this is not haute or unique. \u00a0It should be appreciated for the skill and craftsmanship it took to make something simple good. \u00a0For always giving a damn, Spring Court goes into the Book of Life.Anything roasted...whether it's the Peking Duck or the Suckling Pig, these guys do a very credible job of respecting good ingredients to bring you something special...a brief glimpse into the soul of Singapore roots cuisine. \u00a0True, there are versions of these same offerings all over the world, but bite into Spring Court's to open up the third eye, to begin to understand why Singapore is a top foodie destination.Cold crab. \u00a0This was a revelation for me as I'd never till this last time I was there ever had this. \u00a0It's a meaty crab with abundant roe that's been steamed and then served cold. \u00a0With the vinegar based dipping sauce, this dish took my breath away with its\u200b audacious simplicity. \u00a0An exquisitely fresh ingredient prepared simply with a wickedly ingenious condiment to turn something beautiful into something magical.As I almost never fail to say at the end of all my reviews, please just go out and try this for yourself. \u00a0Stop wondering if I'm overstating my case and just experience Spring Court for yourself! \u00a0You will not regret it.",

    "text": "Booked for 4 tables in karaoke room. Paid $850 per table. Food was mediocre and servings were so small. Most restaurants we go would prepare enough for 10 but this restaurant only had enough for 7 base on their servings. Very disappointing. Suckling pig was too large. Fish was fried till almost black. Even wanted to charge to cut the pig up to smaller pieces. Not service oriented place.",

    "text": "I was so excited to return for their dim sum the second time. However, last Saturday's dim sum was not as spectacular as the first time I was there.My fav char siew so was missing. It is only being served on Sunday and PH. Their siew mai and har kaw are above the average standard. So you may really want to have those as compared to the average dim sum places. They also serve yummy fried beancurd skin & duck congee. I could have all that for myself, but just bear in mind that one basket comes with 3 of each dish. So, please just bring your significant other along instead of 3 friends so that you can have two items and left one for your significant other for each dish ordered. Heh ;)",

The carrot cake and popiah especially were unique and delicious. Everything else was very tastey. The service is fast and efficient. I would certainly come here again with guests. However I probably would go myself because of the cost.",

    "text": "this is where i go to (when i can) everytime im back in town- good food, good service. MUST HAVE : the popiah (spring rolls). a little pricier than your average hawker center popiah, but worth every bit. every bite is heartwarming and chock full of ingredients- fresh prawns, for the most part. they have an offer going on to celebrate their anniversary- spend a min of 85 sgd and get a peking duck at 85cents. TOTALLY worth it. they will then prompt you with what you would like to do with the remaining duck meat. (if they dont, remind them) request for it to be stir fried with the water chestnuts and served with a side of lettuce. (this comes at an extra cost though, but worth it, trust me.) now THAT is true comfort food. they also serve dimsum for lunch, but that's a whole different story- i have not been there for lunch often enough to do a review....yet. ;D",
