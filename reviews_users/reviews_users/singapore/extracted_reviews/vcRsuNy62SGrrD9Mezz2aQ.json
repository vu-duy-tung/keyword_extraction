    "text": "The fried spring is the juiciest I've had, more moist than KFC though not that great in spice levels. Their potato platter definitely meets carb cravings- the wedges are long and thick, nachos are crispy and fries are wonderful. Although the mashed potatoes are very soft and smooth, I find the sauce hard to describe. Good, but I've had better (Popeyes still does the best mashed potatoes). My only gripe is that the coleslaw is small-sized; to me, the coleslaw is quite good, not drenched in sauce. Overall, Arnold's is worth the calories. :)",

    "text": "The best fried chicken in Singapore! The chickens are tender, crispy and moist! The batter is really good. Another of my favorite is the onion rings. It is truly onion ringlets and not some fake onions mixed with lots of flour. The outlet at City Plaza can be quite packed with customers though so to get seats, you may have to wait awhile. And if it happens to be during the fasting month, don't ever think of doing a walk in because this place will already be reserved by others. Besides friend chicken, they serve fish and chips too which is not too bad either. If you order a meal, it usually comes along with some fries, fried bun and coleslaw. The service is quite fast but then again, it depends on the number of customers at that moment. I have never had a bad encounters so far with Arnold's Fried Chicken. For them to come up with delivery optiion is truly a genius idea! For sure, once you take your first bite on their fried chickens, you would not want any other fried chickens elsewhere.",

    "text": "This is a review of a solo dinner at Arnold's Fried Chicken on the second level of City Plaza.This is a difficult review to write. \u00a0Do I review it based on the chicken alone? \u00a0How much do I factor in the sides? \u00a0What about the overall experience? \u00a0What about the time it takes? \u00a0What about the basic fast food ambiance?First, Arnold's had been on my list to check-out for awhile. \u00a0I thought \"what better time than to celebrate the US's National Fried Chicken Day\".They have a slightly unique system. \u00a0You go to the counter that is just outside the restaurant. \u00a0There may be a line-up. \u00a0You place your order. \u00a0You are given a receipt and a paper slip with a number. \u00a0There are numbers on a digital display on the wall. \u00a0Plus, the numbers are called out. \u00a0I think they may also have a system where you can get a text when your number is reached. \u00a0You pay when you return to get your table and food.tinyurl.com/n6vfstcAfter placing your order and getting your number, you go join the masses to await your table and food. \u00a0There are people everywhere awaiting there table. \u00a0There are some seats but most people are standing. \u00a0Some folks (like myself) go for a bit of a walkabout or take a break in one of the nearby massage chairs. \u00a0Sooner or later, your lucky time will come. \u00a0You will hear them call it and see it pop up on the board.tinyurl.com/nynk6kjThis was a Sunday evening. \u00a0I placed my order at 6:12 PM. \u00a0My number was called at 7:05 PM. \u00a0My dinner arrived at my table at 7;20 PM. \u00a0At the end of the meal, there was another 10 to 15 minute wait for the carry-out portion of my order.They do have a lot of staff running about doing this and that. \u00a0For the most part, they were friendly and helpful. \u00a0They even quickly defrayed the commotion prompted by an angry woman who had been away when her number was called.The ambiance is pretty much reminiscent of a fast-food restaurant. \u00a0It is bright and colourful. \u00a0The staff busily works at keeping it clean.tinyurl.com/mf5rxjoThe fried chicken was very good. \u00a0It had a sweetness to the flavour that I do not associate with fried chicken. \u00a0This was accentuated more by the sweet hot sauce they provide. \u00a0The chicken was straight out the fryer. \u00a0It was piping hot. \u00a0The batter was crisp. \u00a0The chicken was tender and very juicy. \u00a0If I could change one thing, I would add a little more salt. \u00a0I loved it. \u00a0Two hours later, the leftovers were still very good.tinyurl.com/ltczspbThe sides were certainly not anything to write home about. \u00a0I do not eat mayo-based coleslaw. Yes, you read that right. \u00a0A southern boy that doesn't eat slaw. \u00a0Who would have thunk it. \u00a0So, it doesn't get factored into the review. \u00a0The fries were as average as it gets. \u00a0They were not crisp. \u00a0They were bland. I mostly ignored them. \u00a0I did really enjoy the small buns. \u00a0They were especially nice when dipped into the gravy from the whipped potatoes. \u00a0If someone was sharing this combo with me, they would have to be very crafty to keep their bun from my prying hands. \u00a0I am not sure that sounds right. \u00a0But, there it is.Also, considering this was a two person combo, the portions for the sides were not very generous.tinyurl.com/llr79deThe whipped potatoes & gravy are the kind that one would get at a school canteen. \u00a0Fortunately, for me, while many shun them, I kind of enjoy them. \u00a0These did not come with the combo for two. \u00a0I added them to my order.tinyurl.com/kmwye2lReceipt (Combo for two + Whole Spring Chicken): $38.80tinyurl.com/mwpdfpcOverall - I am giving Arnold's four stars. This is based pretty much solely on their tasty fried chicken. \u00a0The wait is long. \u00a0The ambiance is basic. \u00a0The sides are nothing grand. \u00a0But, they provide some very good and freshly prepared fried chicken. \u00a0As one can tell from the throngs of folks waiting, Arnold's chicken is Malay approved. \u00a0It is now also Mark approved.(note: i ordered one of their whole spring chickens for takeaway. \u00a0after i eat it, i will add a note. follow up - it was still good. \u00a0tinyurl.com/q29jtp2 )",

But if you're taking it away, then head straight to the main counter, and tackle that massive menu sitting before you. I got a little lost today - I've been fortunate to have people buy this to parties so I've never had to buy this myself before this experience, but I knew what my end goal was, so I did not allow myself to be fazed. After all, I had this chicken in my sights.First-timers? You'll want a two-piece meal. Hungry? Try the half-spring meal. Me? I'll have both please.

Whether it's because it's Malaysian (people always say the KFC in Malaysia tastes better than the Singapore one!) \u00a0or not, the chicken here just tends to be juicier, and the chicken skin is tasty without being too fatty.You can order the fried in pieces, but I personally prefer the half spring chicken - it 's more tender and juicy. The sides are decent too.Queues here can be pretty insane during lunch time - it observes a rather strange system where you order your food at the counter before they seat you. You're better off ordering takeaway from the counter if you're in a rush! For real big fans you can order catering and delivery as well.Not the most convenient place to get to at City Plaza though it's their most central branch - the closest MRT is Paya Lebar but it's still quite a distance to walk from the MRT. Look out for the Watsons, it's right next door on the 2nd level.",

    "text": "Forget KFC or Popeye's. Arnold's is local, and this is where Fried Chicken Mecca is at, I promise. I love my fried chicken every now and then, but Arnold's chicken makes me want to have a daily fix. Avoid this place at all costs if you are on a diet! You have been warned.Located inside this seedy mall, Arnold's gets a crazy queue going at lunch and dinner times. Even when I went early just before 6pm, I still had to stand outside and wait for my queue number to be rung up. Be prepared to wait.You're assigned a table, order and pay at the counter, then they serve up your chicken in about 15 to 20 minutes. I find the chicken significantly less greasy than other place, and it's a beautiful golden colour and doesn't have the taste of old oil that's been reused too many times. They cook your order on the spot and use FRESH chicken that's not been frozen, so the quality of the meat is infinitely better.I don't know what sorcery they dabble in, but even the chicken breast is tender and succulent. My mind screamed that it was impossible, because chicken breast is often dry and tough. The skin was crisp perfection, crunching as I bit into each piece.The side dishes of coleslaw, fries and mashed potato weren't great and very forgettable. I didn't finish them anyway.If you order a set and wish to exchange for other parts, you have to pay a little more for thigh and drumstick portions. You also have to pay if you want mayonnaise. There is service here, but the staff not particularly helpful. They are always in a rush as they have such a high turnover rate.",

Yes, they've got a delivery service now but it's erratic - sometimes have, sometimes don't have.The chicken's amazing. Delightfully fresh, flavourful and succulent, it's a wonder how they can keep even chicken breast meat juicy. As for sides, their thin and crispy natural chips and tangy coleslaw are the best, perfect accompaniment to the main show. Typing this makes me foresee my diet plans slowly seeping away.This outlet is always crowded, prepare for more crowds this month as it's a popular fast-breaking place for Muslims. To accommodate more people, the tables and chairs are squeezed very close to each other; and with the chit-chat chirping all around you, most times it feels like a hen house inside. Don't brood over it though. A taste of Arnold's chicken will soon soothe your ruffled feathers, and leave you cackling like a mother hen.",

    "text": "This used to be one of the hidden gem in Geylang and over the last few years, they had expanded to other 2 outlets in the north/east side of Singapore. Once you tried the fried chicken here, you don't want to go back to KFC. The chicken is not dry. It is fresh, tender and flavorful. If you are in the mood to devour chicken, go for their spring chicken instead of the 2 pcs chicken. :) You won't regret it. Well, You just don't want to count your calories when you are eating it.It can get rather packed during lunch and dinner times. You got to queue for the great stuff. During ramadan, they give priority to the customers who are break fast. The other 2 outlets are at Buangkok Green and Pasir Ris",

Love Arnold's fried chicken - call me crazy but I feel like it's a somewhat healthier version of fried chicken compared to the other popular joints. Perhaps its because they don't cover the chicken pieces in as much batter? Well whatever it is it doesn't feel as oily when you eat it. \u00a0They don't just serve chicken, they have fish and squid as well. It also comes with a huge array of sides - from coleslaw to criss cut fries (YUM!), wedges, onion rings - and with cheese sauce as well! Sounds amazing huh! Also love that it's Halal, so it's an easy choice when organising gatherings. This place is incredibly popular, be prepared to wait. But I assure you it's worth it :)",

    "text": "For a tiny fast food joint located in a relatively obscure part of Singapore, Arnold's Fried Chicken enjoys a rather huge volume of diners. Queues are relatively common, considering the limited seating. One way to beat that is to order take away, as it only takes 5-10mins to get your order and head somewhere else to enjoy your food. The fried chicken though, is relatively so-so in my opinion. It is rather pricey, compared to other fast food joints. I can honestly say that the only good part about the chicken is the crispy skin. The meat on the other hand, is fairly bland and tasteless. So unless they are going to start selling chicken skins as an item, I think you'll be safer off with the other fried chicken joints.",
