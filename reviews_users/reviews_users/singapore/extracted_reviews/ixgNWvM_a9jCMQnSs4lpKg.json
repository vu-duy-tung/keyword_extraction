Taste was spicy enough to make time perspire but for some reason the flavor was a tad lacking. Not enough for me to complain though.I love the decor here - the spacious minimalist interior and huge windows! Coming back for sure.",

Whenever a restaurant has an open kitchen, I know that they pride in the food they prepare, with nothing to hide. I was very satisfied with the items I ordered: The crabmeat fettuccine, mushroom soup, sweet potato crossings, and Americano.Taking a star away for the sweet potato fries which could have been more flavourful (or come with a side of sauce). Otherwise fantastic experience, will definitely return to try other items from the menu!",

I had aglio olio with mushroom and bacon whereas my friends had chilli crab pasta. We also shared sweet potato fries. The dishes were all well done and service was attentive. I would highly recommend checking out this cafe and contributing to society in a small way.",

    "text": "Went to Crossings Cafe for lunch to celebrate my dad's birthday. \u00a0Its a Saturday afternoon and it was crowded. \u00a0Luckily I made a reservation.We ordered the quesadillas and chicken wings for appetisers. The quesadillas were good, even though the fillings were distributed a little unevenly. Chicken wings were good too, with a very good crunch to them, but just slightly over-salty. For mains, we had the laksa, braised beef shin, chicken parmigiana and honey berry ribs. The laksa was surprisingly the best dish of the lot, although 12.90 for laksa is rather expensive. The parmigiana was tasty, but don't order it if you don't like your food deep fried. Some of the ends were almost charred. Almost. The beef shin was tagged to be the best dish of the lot, but unfortunately it was pretty ordinary,like stir fried beef at a zhichar stall. The honey Berry ribs were alright, although I couldn't taste the honey or Berry in the sauce. The ribs themselves were fall-odf-the-bone tender, but slightly underseasoned. Now all the food was served with impeccable timing. The appetisers were served first, and once they were done, all the mains came together.. \u00a0Except the ribs. Unfortunately the waiter forgot to key in my order, and the ribs only arrived 15 minutes after everyone else had finished their mains. The waiter was of course apologetic,and I found it hard to lose my cool when scripture was hanging on the wall right in front of me. Overall, the food was good but somehow just missed the mark by a little bit. If it weren't for the forgotten order, I'd have given it 5 stars.",

    "text": "Though waiting time can take a little longer but the food never disappoints. As a social enterprise, I am very impressed with the level of service delivered by servers who are challenged in different special ways. They are professional and extremely polite. The greatest I derive from dining at this place is the fact that not only do I get good food and good service, all profits are donated to charity! So as I enjoy a good meal, I am also able to contribute to the society. What more can I ask?There are many places that use the term social enterprise very loosely and patrons suffer either from high price (in the name of social cause and benefit) or bad food/service and we are expected to be understanding because the special needs or at-risk individuals are involved. That should not be the case. Quality and experience should not be compromised for the sake of social good. I fully support Crossings because they have created an environment that bring out the best in all the staff, regardless of their special needs and patrons are always well taken care of. Respect!",

But the sweet potato fries were delicious. The spicy coriander fish was good. Decent slab of fish and the coriander paste was tasty and nicely calibrated. I like that the orange juice tasted fresh squeezed not concentrate. Place was bright and buzzy and there's free wifi. Good place to grab quick bite and I love the social enterprise driven nature.

    "text": "Been wanting to try out this place for about a month now after chancing upon reviews on Yelp and of course to aid social enterprises along the way. Came here after attending a visual art exhibition at Singapore Arts Museum (walkable distance) and since there were quite a number of space, we managed to get seated on a comfy sofa like chair. The waiter approached us checking whether we would want some iced water while we decide on our orders. It was a nice professional gesture from their end. After browsing through a one double sided menu, I decided to order the following.1) Wanted to order root beer but it was out of stock. Same with my friends' orders of Ginger beer.2) Decided to order Snapple's pink lemonade instead.3) Chilli crab pasta sounded good at that moment so decided to order that. They ran out of Fettuccine so I had to change the pasta to spaghetti instead. Verdict: pasta was warm when it was served, chewy and tender in terms of texture. The \u00a0deep fried soft shell crab were both delicious and crunchy (managed to get the ones with eggs) and the Crossings' own chilli crab claw meat sauce were flavorful and hint of spicy made the dish special. (definitely recommended)4) My friend ordered fish and chips. The fish batter was pretty good and the portion of the fish fillet was bigger than expected too. 5) Hazelnut molten cake with ice cream. The dish was warm when it arrived to our table. The chocolate was a little bitter but the cake was moist and soft. Combined with the vanilla ice cream, it is one of best lava cake in Singapore. Overall, price wise it was quite affordable and considering that profits will be directed to charities made this place a gem. The service was excellent too as they checked on the customers' needs quickly when customers raised their hands. As my friends and I left for this place, we were also greeted with a thanks. Will be back soon for more yummy goodies :)",
