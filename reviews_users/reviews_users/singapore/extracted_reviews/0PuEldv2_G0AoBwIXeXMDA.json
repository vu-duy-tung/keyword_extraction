Then they received 3 chopsticks and became so popular that when we went one day, the soup was not hot. Turned us off and never went back for years.It's gone upmarket in price. Used to be about $8 for a deluxe bowl. Today big prawns with 2 small whole Australian abalone is $15 per bowl. I prefer the good old days when the abalone was sliced. Hard to bite through a thick abalone. Still good but I don't think the soup is as good as it was years ago. Not as thick. It is strictly self-service even though she only had one bowl to serve at 3 p.m. It's good but no longer a die die must eat to me.",

    "text": "Saw my friend post about this place on Facebook so I brought my parents here for lunch on a Saturday. Good thing we got here a little before 2pm. I didn't know that they sell out of stuff. When we got there they only had 3 items on the menu left. We ordered the prawn with scallop and the prawn with pig tail for $6 each. You place your order, get a number and wait for your number to be called to collect your noodles. The noodles really didn't disappoint. I got the dry kway teow mee. Both the noodles and broth were delicious. The downside for me was the location, it's a little hard to get to where I live. It was also raining heavily the day we came here. You're pretty much trapped if you're caught without an umbrella. But definitely worth making a trip!",

Yet the opening hours on their website states that they close at 4:30pm. 1.5 hours before their stated closing time. If they close earlier, then they should just state accordingly on their website; rather than give misleading information and cause people to make wasted trips. Better arrive at the shop some time before 3:00pm to ensure that they are still open.They also charge a whopping $1.00 for a refill of soup when it is free in almost all other prawn noodle stalls. Poor attitude !",

    "text": "I've been going to this store for about a decade. My family loves to eat black chicken/turtle soup at nearby Ser Seng, which I was not a big fan of. I took a walk once, found this stall, and just fell in love with it.I'm not a big fan of soup, especially noodles in soup (with the exception of ramen), so I always go for the dry version here. I like heavy food and tbh, the noodles here is very greasy, oily, saucy and combine it with the fried onion that soaks up all of that, it's the perfect recipe for a guilty pleasure. I also get the pig's tail, intestine and ribs alongside my prawn. CHOLESTEROL LEVEL OVER 9000!!!On a bad side note though, I noticed that their quality dropped a level or two during my last visit. I haven't been there for some time, and was looking forward to some good prawn mee but was left disappointed. I hope it was just a blip and I'll definitely go again.A tip: The uncle that cooks at night uses more sauce/oil/spice than the auntie who cooks in the afternoon. And this place opens up till late, a great supper spot!",

    "text": "Was brought here by my boss when I was still working in the Ubi vicinity. The whole company used to troop out for a prawn mee fix once every two weeks - or, every time someone's craving got the better of that.I always think the soup is really pretty much what determines if the prawn noodles will be good. Here the broth is obviously created from good stock that has been painstakingly brewed for hours. The prawns are always fresh (and huge) with that nice crunch that comes with being well-cooked. Add on their signature chilli powder for spiciness with a slight hint of garlic.The only issue I have is with the lunchtime crowd. Pick a less common hour to enjoy and to avoid standing in the torturous sun, ready to pounce on the next available seat",

    "text": "This is one of the most popular prawn noodle places in town. For $4, you get 3 deshelled but head-on prawns which is certainly a joy to those who hate peeling their prawns. \u00a0The prawns were indeed fresh, but it is about the same quality as the half-sliced prawns you get ordinarily at prawn stores - so don't expect the prawn quality to be on par with those prawns fresh out of the net. The noodles was not bad, quite a nice texture - delicious but not fantastic. The chilli sauce lacks punch and could be slightly more salty. The best part of this store is that it opens 24 hours a day!",
