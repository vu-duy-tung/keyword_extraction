I had a dinner treat by my girlfriend and the staff are friendly and attentive. I ask to seat Outdoor as I enjoyed the greenery scenery.My boss bring me and admin team out for my farewell lunch. We order their set lunch and the food is nicely placed on the plate.I order their mushroom bruschetta and its Portobello mushroom was so yummy and juicy ..... The juice is oozing out when I had my 1st bite.I had a spaghetti for lunch and I simply love their pasta. This is a place that I would go when I'm craving for pasta.The overall ambience is quite relax and it would be a great place to chill out.",

Not even a \"hello\"! \u00a0For the main, she was was forced to who had one dish (so, that's how we know she is not a mute!). You also must like fake plastic unripe tomatoes... with your $34 buttata. And finally, forget the presentation, when you look at your pasta. Gone is the half lobster on the tagliolini... was clearly taking too much real estate!Im afraid we won't be back for another while...",

We had some hits and misses, for example some dishes were over seasoned but others were under seasoned. Service here is also wanting. It's hard to get any information at all about dishes, seems the wait staff have no idea or are not trained to respond to simple queries. Many better options elsewhere.",

Cicheti and Operetta have better (Napoli-style) crust. Bella Pasta has the same level of quality of their pastas but the portions are about twice the size of the portions here, and the riverside view is better.They also removed the calzone from their menu, then when I asked if I could still order it, they made it for me (which was nice of them) but they charged 30++ for it, even though it seemed to have less food than the salami pizza which is 25++.At least the service is good.",

    "text": "I was here for a good friend's wedding and they had actually booked the whole restaurant (dining & lounge area), but when we arrived we found the lounge area had been given to another group for a birthday party. Naturally we were pissed. Apparently they double booked and we had no choice but to put up with the lack of a cocktail area, the noise, and having to guide guests to the right part of the restaurant. The ambience was nice, almost like dining in a garden. The food was excellent, but they served the wrong appetizer so we were furious. Of course we had to leave our game faces on. Service was great by fine dining standards. The only thing that was a bit of a nuisance was that they only have two restrooms. One was on the first floor of the bungalow but the other was on the second floor where private rooms are located, \u00a0and that wasn't ideal for tipsy guests. The guests enjoyed the wedding and after they left, my friend spoke to the event planner of the restaurant about all the things that went wrong that night. Eventually the event planner waived the charges for all the bottles of wine that were opened. It's a nice place to have a party if you have money to spend.",

Indoors it is cosy and nicely furnished, but outdoors is the best because it feels romantic and peaceful. Except for an occassional annoying mosquito, so i would recommend to wear shoes and long pants. The staff is very friendly and the service is prompt. But the best thing is...the 50% discount you get when you have a palate membership / american express platinum card. If you have something to celebrate this is definitely the place to go.",

I brought my boyfriend to this restaurant to celebrate his birthday and we sat outside, going for the alfresco romantic ambience. There is something about this restaurant that removes you out of your usual world and brings you to a peaceful state. We had the Wagyu beef carppacio as appetizer and it was something I have never tried before. Thankfully, it was delicious. Complex and slightly strange in its flavour, it excited my palate for more. We got a pizza and pasta for our main courses and both were very satisfying. Da paolo have got the italian thin crust pizza dough down to perfection and is by far one of my favourite pizzas in Singapore. Their tiramisu is a must try! Not one with a strong alcohol kick, their tiramisu is much mellower, yet smooth, light and well-balanced, just the way it is enjoyed traditionally by the italians!",

You know how some cream based pasta or risotto will give you that 'gelat' feeling after a few bites.. None from Da paolo's! Their risotto just makes me crave for more and more with every bite.Atas place with good food, good ambience and great service. Perfect dining experience & a great place to go for your next date!",

For once, it wasn't like the Singaporean \"mui fan\" dish, and it was very quickly devoured. Also, one of the better tiramisu served - soft yet not mushy, fragrant yet not choking with alcohol. Braised lamb shank, not that great. It was tough, and I'd recommend not getting it. The setting is lush, and I love the rustic decor. Think wooden floors, hanging lights, and being very close to the greenery around. Servers are also very used to being asked to take photographs for customers, although their skills haven't improved - photos taken by them turn out dark, blurry or both.",
