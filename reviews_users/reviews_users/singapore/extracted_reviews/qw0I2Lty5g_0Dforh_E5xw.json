There are two sauces to choose from - soy garlic and hot & spicy ... both are equally awesome depending on your mood and preferences. What I love most is the crispy crunchy skin and how it stays that way even after an hour or two. The skinny fries are also pretty good ... but really, the star of the show really is the chicken!",

    "text": "I do like the small size fried chicken here and I am glad it is still around since it opened a few years ago. The menu has expanded over the years and now includes rice, wraps and salad options. I decided to try to the chicken rice set which has 3 pieces of chicken (wings or drumlets), kimchi coleslaw and rice. Combo gets you a drink. The rice, sprinkled with seaweed strips, reminded me of Tori-Q's rice. It was not the usual rice, maybe it was Japanese or Korean grains? The kimchi slaw was interesting, creamy and slightly tart, not spicy to me. The chicken which I requested for a mix (soy garlic or hot) and they were a bit on \u00a0the salty side. They were also not that spicy to me. I still like them though. I would stick with the basics next time and just focus on the crispy chicken and either have that alone or with fries. The fries were pretty good, based on previous experiences. The queue is madness during lunch time and after. I realize it is because there is usually one cashier doing everything - taking order, getting drinks, payment. Plus it does not help the entire menu is only on the counter, and with so much choices, first time \u00a0or indecisive customers will also hold up the line. Those items on the board are only the popular or standard items. Then you get those who ordered take-away but still sat down on the dining-in chairs, giving another illusion of a packed place.",

    "text": "One thing I dislike about many of the Korean fried chicken joints in Singapore is that these joints never seem to change their oil. Don't get me wrong, 4 fingers is pretty darn good (similar to Bonchon in NY in taste but horrible cooking) and it def has a lot of potential, but the actual restaurant itself screws up the chicken during it's frying process. I don't know if they are just being shady and super cheap with the oil changing or if they overfry the heck out of the thing, but most of the time when I place an order, my fried chicken comes out looking more black than normal. Korean fried chicken I know has a light brown/gold color that is plump and juicy in taste. Instead, I get dark brown/near black chicken that is so tough to chew that it leaves me feeling frustrated, because the sauce is great and I could've had a great chicken. 4 fingers, please. change. your. oil! at least once a day please! (or more, since you usually have lines forming out the restaurant)",

Initial impression was it was a KFC (Kentucky) knock off but upon investigation, I found out it was the other KFC (Korean) and had to try some. So I braved the queue one evening and got some take out to bring back to my hotel. I got the #1 combo which was 6 pieces of chicken, a serving of kimchi fries and a drink.I was afraid that in the few minutes it would take me to get back to hotel the chicken would lose some of it's crispiness. Boy I was wrong, this was the most crunchy morsels of chicken I have ever had - and I eat a lot of chicken. The double or triple frying technique definitely has worked without drying out the centre of the chicken. The spicy batter with the crispy skin was awesome and I will be no advocating bring 4 fingers to Australia! The kimchi flavoured fries were great and held quite a bit of punch.The high turnover ensures you get freshly fried chicken and fresh fries so I suggest that you only buy when there IS a queue!",

It is true that it is pricier but if you love fried chicken as much as I do, you will understand why I'm that willing to part with my money for 4 Finger's chicken. Perhaps their flavours do the trick. Both Soy Garlic and Hot & Spicy pack a punch and are fantastic but I tend to prefer the Hot & Spicy as I love anything/everything spicy. The chicken is tasty through and through and the skin is absolutely sinful yet irresistible. The chicken is fried nice and crisp on the outside, yet remains really juicy and tender inside.

Also, I would recommend going for either drumlets or drumsticks. Don't bother with the wings because to achieve the level of crisp, the chicken pieces are over fried.
