But that being said the got they basics down right!",

Sure, sometimes it might cost an arm and a leg to get a taste of home, but c'est la vie, right?It's about damn time bagels have come to the red dot, and Two Men Bagel House is filling that void for me. You can find these guys opposite Cold Storage in the Icon Village extension.I'm somewhat of a bagel purist, so I stuck with my favourite sesame bagel with plain cream cheese. (I did love how they added black sesame seeds to theirs, though!) My colleague had a cinnamon raisin bagel with walnut raisin cream cheese, which she loved. I mean, where else in SG can you get walnut raisin cream cheese?!They also have heavier meals if you're looking past cream cheese, so check 'em out. I also loved how they were blasting a live recording of John Mayer while we were there. And the chalkboard is titled \"Menu of Sorts\". These guys just speak to me and I must say they're as good as it gets in SG!",

The piglet, which includes a hash brown, crispy bacon, garlic aioli sauce, lettuce, and maybe tomato(?), was scrumptious. Definitely one of the best bagel sandwiches I've ever had. On top of that, they serve these bad boys all day long.Prices are reasonable ($8.50 for the piglet) if not a touch pricey given the size of the servings. Taste makes up for that though. I also went out on a limb and splurged on the $4.50 lemonade. It was worth it. I even got a free refill; probably wouldn't happen if I hadn't been one of only 3 or 4 customers on a lazy Sunday, but kudos for the responsive service given the circumstances.The vibe is relaxed and you can see the young staff rolling the dough and tossing those suckers in the oven. Absolutely, 100% worth another (or multiple) visits.",

Sure, you can find bagels at Fair Price and Jason's, but if you want high quality bagels that actually taste fresh and authentic, you have to come here. It's located in ICON with AC and free seating. Their bagels are chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. They also have an amazing, creative selection of savory bagel sandwiches.

For some reason this bagel was flat it was missing some of that cushion. Now I'm sure it's really hard to get bagels here in Singapore. But 101 before in baking dough is, dough needs to rise. This gives it that consistency of that doughy taste. Unfortunately there was no rise. They have great combinations of putting a sandwich together but their main focus should be making that bagel taste great. Try it out and you can see what I mean.",

My first counter with Two Men Bagel House was during a Yelp event that my friend brought me to (also the event where I downloaded the app and joined the community) where there were coffee and bagels! I had quite a good impression of the menu that they brought over during the event and definitely fell in love with the Jalape\u00f1o cream cheese - it is to. die. for. (IMHO*) The bagels that were brought to the event were way beyond the normal plain bagel, and my friend and I were lucky enough to be the last to share a sundried tomato bagel - I highly recommend this because the bagel itself is so flavorful! It was a more DIY / pick-your-own-fillings at the event, which I liked because friend and I decided that we should share the bagel AND have two different flavours in one bagel as we didn't want to take one each - too much bagel for breakfast! My office recently moved to somewhere near Icon where TMBH is located, in fact, we're practically across-the-road neighbors now! And, I had to had down to try at least one other bagel, right? Thus began the quest to find lunch buddies who wanted bagels too - which wasn't too hard because all I had to do was shout 'bagels for lunch?' and I got a few brave volunteers that took the journey to TMBH with me. There was a crowd! It was around lunch time and there were many other brave knights who had braved the CBD heat to Icon and were waiting be around for their orders. Even though TMBH has seats, not many were filled up because office people, we just like to have lunch in office (me especially, because what's a cafe in the office for if we don't use it!) I got myself a Piglet to bring back and I swear, best piglet ever. It's something I highly recommend everyone to try if they're looking for a breakfast /brunch / lunch bagel!* in my humble opinion",

But glad I read through all the reviews before I went into the actual store. Told my colleagues about this place and got her hook up with this AMAZING bagel house. She ended up going to this bagel house almost everyday. Meanwhile, I was busy with my works and didn't start to visit this place until two weeks ago. It turns out to be the best bagel place I ever been to!!! HANDS DOWN!!! They HANDMAKE all of their bagels (which you rarely find it even in the states) Personally, I grew up eating a lot of bagels during my high school years. I always had some cravings when I came back to Asia. Luckily, I discovered this place and all the bagels here are on point. Also, all the staffs are very SWEET and shoutout to Borne for making amazing coffees all the time. Food: a variety of bagels you can choose from. They have some great menus and definitely going to suit your taste buds. My favorite one is LOX bagel and they deliver good quality foods consistently! People & service: I always value customer services more than anything else. I promise \u00a0you, you won't regret talking to any of those staffs there!!! I pay a full respect to the business model they have for the bagel house.Keep up with the good work man!!! Will definitely come back visiting when I come to Singapore :)",

Every time I'm even remotely near Tanjong Pagar (so maybe all of Singapore) I think to myself, ohemgee I could get a bagel.'The Lox' comes with pickled beets that are freakishly pink and delicious. Other innovative sandwiches are also great. Tbh these bagel sandwiches get a little messy and filling, but it's Singapore and if you're looking for bagels, it's really only here or Sacha and Son's in my book. (But plz let me know if you find anything else!!!!!)Yours truly,A New York Bagel Freak",

Apparently there are very few places to get a good bagel in Singapore.These guys are the real deal. The owners told me they travelled to all the bagel hot spots around the world to work out exactly how to make the perfect bagel. I think they've nailed it.I had the fruit and cinnamon bagel with walnut and raisin creamed cheese. I had never tried walnut and raisin cream cheese before and it was a revelation, especially on the spicy fruit bagel.They don't just offer the bagels, they have more full breakfast options (eggs etc) that accompany bagels too.My only gripe is that they didn't have any tea - a breakfast drink staple.",

I suppose if you're running tight on the clock over a typical lunch hr frenzy, this isn't exactly fast grub. The combination was spot on. I'm no fan of rockets/arugula but the creamy sriracha aioli masked the earthy greens and I was secretly glad to be chomping down on those greens. The sunny side, albeit thoroughly cooked, was a perfect complement to the diced avocados. For a weekend mid-day indulgence, this spam offering certainly came with some saving grace.If life was a circle, please at least let it be a bagel.",

    "text": "I'm a crazy bagel fan. I'd have one (or two) a day every time i'm in NYC (it's my post yoga breakfast staple). I even signed up for bagel baking classes just so that i can make my own (i still haven't though) because nothing in Singapore satisfies my craving. Well Sacha & Sons does a decent one but there is only 1 option (sesame, with garlic herb schmear). I've been meaning to try Two Men Bagel for the longest time, upon word that freshly baked hand-rolled doughs are done here. To determine the quality of the bagel, i had to order them on their own. Bagels are priced from $2.60 onwards. I went with the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with Walnut and Raisin Cream Cheese ($4.50) because sweet is always logical with a latte.Well well. Knock knock. The crust was more like a shell, with a slightly blistered crust all around. It was too hard (mind you i'm comparing them to the NYC ones). Plus the dough was a little thin, thus it lacked that nice doughy chew. Flavor wise, it was also kind of strange, with an alkaline aftertaste, possibly due to the almost pretzel like shell. Perhaps i should have stuck with the regular cream cheese because the walnut raisin one was kind of grainy instead of rich creamy and the amount was so little! URGH. #spoiltbynyc Next time, i may just go with the Plain Cream Cheese and Berries Jelly but honestly they need to have more cheese on these.Well Jr really liked the Chix ($9.90) on his onion bagel. The tender house-roasted diced chicken thigh were generously smothered in lemon garlic aioli and peppered with the sourish pickled relish and fresh greens. We both agreed that the filling was delicious but it overshadowed the bagel. It could have been any other bread. In fact, it would have been better if it were a different carb that didn't jab our gums with the hard shell. I had a few bites of the onion bagel on its own and it was rather flavorless, alkaline, and hard. BAH.I really wanted to love Two Men Bagel, but i can't. Can i like it? Maybe. But it kinda ranks the same as the packaged NYC Bagel Factory bagels, which may not be as fresh but at least their crust is better. Go for their bagel-wiches to avoid disappointment. At least it'll fill you up and the filling will distract you from the bagels. Or get the sesame bagels from Sacha & Sons and slather it with your own cream cheese mix.",

It just didn't even taste like bread - it didn't have the right yeast-y flavor I suppose.We ordered 3 cinnamon raisin bagels and 20 minutes later they told us they'd ran out... Broke my heart. A tub of cream cheese to go is rather pricey - $8 for plain, $12 for the flavored ones. I suppose I should come back to try something else - maybe a cinnamon raisin bagel with the walnut raisin cream cheese... And I wish they had whole wheat bagels!",

The bagels themselves are, of course, amazing.I like their non-pretentious attitude here - they allow you to bring whatever drinks you want to accompany your bagel (in fact, they helpfully suggest that the Cold Storage opposite has chilled wine for sale). I've never seen that level of hospitality elsewhere. Kudos to them!",

One bagel plain with no cream cheese (schmear on their menu) costs $2.60, or you can order 3 bagels for $6. I went with a friend and got 3 bagels toasted, with no schmear, mostly due to the price tag. The schmear costs +$3-5 extra, which is quite significant compared to the cost of the bagel. All three bagels I ordered (black and white sesame, multigrain, and cinnamon raisin) were excellent, tasting fresh and perfect. Will definitely come back again when I have my carb cravings!",

It is actually lemony too which is so nice because quite often lemonade in this sector of the world is very sweet. I actually got the lemonade for free which was really sweet of them! Thanks for that my dudes. The bagel is a proper bagel in that it is chewy and chunky and perfectly toasted. For 12 bucks the lox bagelwich is worth it because it is packed to the brim with salmon!! Sometimes places charge a lot for salmon and what not and then give you a meager portion... NOT HERE!! All in all, if you are craving deli style, New York or Brick Lane beigels, this is where you should go.",

It was one of the establishments that kept appearing under most recommended whenever I was around the area, so i really had to try it.The place itself reminded me of a small cafe, seatings were limited and the menu was mostly written in chalk on the boards above.Pricing aside (hint, its abit expensive for bagels, but then again, everything around this area is priced on the higher end), the bagels were really fresh and delicious! I ordered myself a 'chix' bagel which was basically mayo chicken with an assortment of herbs and spices inside. What took me back was not the filling, but the bagel itself! They went out of 'rye' bagels and i decided to go for the caramelized onion flavour (i think thats what its called), not knowing what to expect. The explosion of moist flavor from the bagels was really something i was not expecting, since what i ordered was actually quite dry.That being said, I've decided to make it my personal mission to at least try half of the bagels on menu, the flavour combinations all sounds very interesting and delicious!If you're looking for a quick quality breakfast, lunch or snack and dont mind paying abit extra for yummy FRESHLY made bagels, do give this place a try!!!!",

I organized a potluck brunch on Sunday and my American friend brought a giant brown bag to lunch. I was all \"hrmph who brings store bought food to a potluck?\" as I cooked my organic sausages from Ryan's when he said, \"I brought bagels\". That made me almost drop my sausages right there.Bagels?!! In Singapore? \"\"Please tell me it's not those expensive things masquerading as bagels from 'New York' that are sold in Cold Storage?\"\"Nope it's from Two Man. It's right by my house, I chat with them all the time and they make awesome, as-good-as-it-gets-in-Singapore bagels...oh and try the walnut cinnamon raisin something magic spread in that tub and thank me later.\"At that point I was pretty stoked to find the bag contained TWENTY bagels in a gazillion flavors. I couldn't find a sesame bagel (cos I'm boring like that) but I found a brown raisin one, popped it in the toaster and generously spread the magic stuff on. Oh. Ma. Gawsh. Oh. My.I ate that bagel in about a minute. And then I ate a half more.It was crisp on the outside and had a good chew. Granted it isn't New York or Bodo's great, but hey we're in Singapore. Plus I'm told the prices are faaaairly reasonable, unlike the child I traded in at Sacha & Sons for a lox bagel. So yes, the next time I intend to blow my carb budget, I'm taking this bum down to icon village. Wherever that is.",

    "text": "When my friend swore Two Men Bagel House was close to the real thing in NY I refused to believe it. If no where else in America could get it right, how could a small place inside of a mall in Singapore do it? I'm not sure but this happens to be one of my only repeat experiences in the city because the bagels are just that good.Is it true to form NYC? Not entirely. They're a bit on the small side but boy, do they have a bite to them. The old myth of New York bagel success was something along the lines of \"it's (the elements) in the water\" but was later debunked to be the boiling process of said water and barley to make it truly stand out. Could Two Men be employing a similar method?They claim to be the first bagel house in all of Singapore and started only a handful of years ago. Each bagels are supposedly handmade and they recommend that folks who don't want to face the daily disappointment of their potential selling out should call ahead of time to confirm availability.The bagels themselves are soft and have just the right amount of density. The variety is not impressive to most New Yorkers / Montreal folks, but they do have some interesting ones like cheddar, salt, garlic, and all-sorts (everything bagel). The salmon they're using is not the kind of lox I'd find back home, but this is a respectable alternative for being on the other side of the world.For first timers, keep an open mind. This is one of the only games in town and the closest thing to anything from the US. Try one of their bagel sandwiches (I vote for the lamb or bo-ssam) and beware of the morning lines.",

The smoked beef one is particularly good, although being able to go and buy a decent smoked salmon bagel in Singapore still remains one of my favourite discoveries in the relative food desert of Tanjong Pagar. The filling is generous enough that these days we split one between two, but we're not big eaters. Service is fast and friendly.",

Just gobbled down the last bite of my A.B.L.T. from Two Men Bagel House and boy am I happy. SG may look back in the future and possibly say the Eastern European\u00a0food scene started right here at TMBH, albeit by a Singaporean. Love the vibe from this place and of course the bagels. Walked up to the order counter and just about everyone in the kitchen greeted me with a big hello and a smile. Don't come here if you're looking for a bona fide, proper New York bagel because the owner, Borne, tells me that his bagels are made with the Singaporean taste buds in mind. He's tried bagels from both coasts of the U.S. (probably in between too) and has decided to make the bagels lighter and smaller. He make batches throughout the day to ensure freshness and quality. Business had a rough start a couple of years ago but things are really rolling now. Swing by and get treated like a VIP customer, which is becoming a rarity these days, and treat yourself to a round of deliciousness. You won't regret it.",

Hence upon moving to Singapore, I scour the island every time my inevitable cravings hit. Two Men Bagel is an obvious choice for bagel lovers and you can see from the queue that it's made up of a lot of homesick westerners. The bagels are no where near as massive as in New York and it doesn't have that sheen to it, but then again, they don't have the water. The sandwiches are inventive, bordering on too ambitious. Because the bagels themselves aren't that large, the filling often falls out, leaving your hands a mess. Like all foreign foods swept far from their homeland, it's more expensive (especially the drinks, my God it's robbery) and not as good, but it's all we have. +1 star for the great 90's and 00's rap and hip hop playlist, interrupted only by great 00's emo music.",

When you order at the register, you give them your name and they'll holler for you when your order is ready. I recommend doing their \"Two Men's Crafted Bagelwiches,\" don't just get a plain bagel with cream cheese. They have gotten so creative with their menu, and I have to say there is not one thing on the menu that doesn't sound mouthwateringly delicious to me. I am working my way through their menu, and so far everything I've had is top notch. My favorites so far are the \"Cow King\" and the \"Bird,\" and what I really love about this place is that you can choose whatever type of bagel you want for the bagelwiches. I really hope they do well and open more locations!",

    "text": "My timing was pretty bad - lunchtime, very crowded. Nevertheless I made it to the counter and ordered a Rodeo.I love roast beef and it sounded great. I ordered a rye bagel and set down at one of the large tables that are meant for sharing. The bagel arrived shortly thereafter. What surprised me was the brown colour of the roast beef but I tasted it anyway. It did taste different from what I am used to, and was a bit too thick and fatty for my personal taste, but the greens and the relish and the sauce.. very nice. The bagel itself was close to fluffy, but still some density for a good bite and taste without having to worry about an immediate shutdown of any bowel movements which is often the case with heavy bagel dough.Later on I was curious whether roast beef in S'pore is different from what I am used to and went on their Facebook page: there was a photo that showed the Rodeo with pinkish roast beef. So, I don't know what piece of meat I had today but it surely (unfortunately I forgot to take a photo..) wasn't the standard.I did love the friendly, smiley staff. Having had my share of snobbish, ignorant staff at other places this week, this was really nice.So, I'll be back!",

I'm here once every couple weeks, and consistently leave happy. Staff is nice, and bagels/sammiches affordable and good. I'd say breakfast items are better than lunch, but I'm also just a big fan of breakfast. FOOD (have tried everything on the menu O_O): * my order: sesame bagel toasted, with jalapeno cream cheese, tomatoes, and cucumbers* would also recommend Spam or Chorizo breakfast sandwichSERVICE: * very friendly (they'll remember your order) * usually pretty fastPRICE: * $ (less than $20 per pax)OVERALL: * good for breakfast/brunch* delivery available through deliveroo (carries pretty well)",
