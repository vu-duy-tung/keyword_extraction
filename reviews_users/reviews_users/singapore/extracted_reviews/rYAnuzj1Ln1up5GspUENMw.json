The broth is good, but tastes more strongly of pork than prawn, probably because they use pork lard for the stock. The ngoh hiang with yam and shrimp cracker (you have to queue at a separate stall) is also really good. Overall, it's worth a visit if you're in the area, but loses a star for the chaotic seating and parking situation.",

Beach Road Prawn Noodle House quickly made it to the top of my list of must eat places in Singapore.Prawns are large and fresh, and are cut in a way such that it's relatively painless to slide the shells off the meat. The noodle bowls come in three sizes- small, medium, jumbo. You can choose to have your noodles in a soup, or dry (with soup on the side). And from your noodles, you can choose thin rice noodles or chewy egg noodles, or a combination of both! I tried both noodles, and both were cooked to a perfect texture. The broth here has a heavy prawn flavor, and you can tell it's been cooked with rich seafood. Other prawn mee places have broths that barely have prawn flavors to it, and taste mostly like pork. I don't usually drink broth for a noodle soup, but I downed this one like there was no tomorrow. Never in my life have I eaten a bowl of noodles and soup so quickly before. This place was so good that I ended up coming here multiple times within the span of a few days.",

There's always something awesome around the corner.So I meant to grab a coffee with some folks at Penny University, but our friends who'd got there before us decided that hunger pangs needed to be dealt with first. So off they went to Beach Road Prawn Noodle House. And that never ends well... for my wallet.As the name suggests, they are specialists, and their prawn broth is SO ROCKSTAR. I always get the dry noodles with pork ribs - I feel the noodles don't get as soggy and soup-laden (not that it's a bad thing), and I get to drink the soup separately, apart from the chili and what nots that find their way into the bowl.My only beef (okay not beef, but you get it) is that prices have gone UP. Now this is how it looks:small - $5.80medium - $8.80large - $10.80I understand prawns and pork ribs aren't cheap... but this is pretty mad. So do your wallet, and your cholesterol level a favour, and ration out your visits. After all, the worst thing you could do to yourself is get sick of great food.",

The pork rib is not the best considering the price I would have expected a higher quality, like prime rib. \u00a0You can also get pig tail, which was nicely cooked and tender.

Prawn mee with pork ribs- the broth was great! although they didn't give a lot of noodles. - pork was good. prawns as expected. - pricing per bowl was $5.50-10 (for the jumbo). I think it's quite pricey considering it's a coffee shop open air type place (in Singapore). 2. Ngoh hiong- they shared the coffee shop space (2 units) with a Ngoh Hiong shop. I think it's probably owned by the same people. - Ngoh hiong was good! We ordered the i) you tiao with fishcake, ii) money bags (kinda like a fried wanton), iii) some fried beancurb skin with fishcake (this was so thin & crispy), iv)spring rolls. Everything was great! except the spring rolls (don't bother ordering that). - The red sauce that accompanied the Ngoh Hiong was awesome! sweet yet a little spicy at the same time.Definitely will head back for more prawn mee & ngoh hiong :)Only draw back was the parking - super hard to get a spot! and the parking attendent comes pretty frequently to fine people who were illegally parking on the double yellow lines (be warned).",

I've been coming here since I was a kid and the price of the prawn mee, like my girth, has increased exponentially. Which is a bit ridiculous, isn't it? Why would anyone pay upwards of $5 for a bowl of prawn mee, and still have to put in the labour of peeling the shell? Er. That would be me, actually. The soup is thick and flavourful, the pork rib, tender, and the chili powder. Oh, the chili powder. The soup would be incomplete without a couple of heavy handed dashes of spice. Noodles are fairly standard, but it's the soup that delivers a warming kick in the pants. Parking, like most of the Katong/Joo Chiat stretch is treacherous. We've only ever illegal parked there before, and even so, that gives you two lots to play with. Good luck fighting with the hungry hoards over the limited space.",

I had the soup version when I was younger but have grown to love the \"dry\" version. You can order your noodles in soup or with soup on the side - the latter makes for a better choice because you will be able to enjoy the rich broth in its original form, especially fantastic when spiced up with a bit of chilli from the noodles. If you are having the noodles dry, mix in some chilli powder and you'll get a kick out of eating this bowl of noodles. There are people who pick the pork ribs and prawn option. You can also request to have your prawns deshelled. But I think the original works super well for me.",

I always find myself going for refills of the soup. Another good thing about the place is that there is a Ngoh Hiang Stall within the premises.
