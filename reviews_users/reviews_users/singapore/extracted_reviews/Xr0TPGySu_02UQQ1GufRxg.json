    "text": "Rumor has it that the truffle fries are deep fried IN truffle oil...and from catching a whiff of the tantalizing basket of fries from several meters away, I am inclined to believe it! Apart from being saturated in truffle oil, the fries are well seasoned with salt and dried parsley, which brings the overall taste to a whole new level. The much raved about second generation Mac & cheese lives up to the hype as well - each glorious scoop comes fully loaded with an even spread of wild mushrooms, shell macaroni and ooey gooey CHEESE! But the highlight for me was the Buttermilk Fried Chicken; its toasty and tender insides perfectly complemented the crisp maple-drizzled exterior! It's definitely a must try for all fried chicken lovers out there! We were unfortunately unable to capitalize on any of their daily promotions, but I would recommend doing so if possible as the food is a little pricey. All in all, It's certainly a perfect place for special occasions where one can splurge and indulge without any guilt whatsoever!",

That is until the last few bites, when I slathered all the remaining frosting on quite decadently.The Mac and cheese, while not the classic southern style baked with eggs that I prefer, was satisfyingly rich and the mushroom bits were particularly delicious.The steak sandwich looked a bit rare for sampling, but the Cajun fries were tasty indeed.The only downside for me was that the bathroom area is extremely warm, clean but warm.PARTING THOUGHT: definitely a nice option for brunch!",

    "text": "I want to love this place. Unfortunately the reality is not as good as imagined. I don't mind it, but it is definitely not a \"I like it so much I want to keep going back\" kind of place unless I live in the vicinity. Friends like the place and the food (though some said it was quite average). So maybe that skewed my expectations a little. I was there early around 615 pm and a few tables were occupied. I told the manager/owner that I was still waiting for my friend and was thus left alone after being given a menu. No offer of \"Can I get you a drink first?\", even though it was another 15 minutes before my friend finally arrived (bad traffic!). Left to my devices, I checked out the decor. It was the now common industrial look with grey concrete walls and functional tables and chairs. Specials were written on the board hanging on one side of wall. Each table was prettied up with flowers stuck in a jar. At least there was some attention to details. Service was prompt once my friend arrived. Another server came over and told us the specials and brought us water after we placed our order. There were a few things I want to try:- crab cakes (was told it was so-so)- risotto balls (only to order it if you love rice/risotto)- carbonara pasta (it was good, the usual item ordered by friend)- fish and chips (not too bad)- espresso bacon burger (not bad)- buttermilk fried chicken (only available on Wednesday and sometimes Thursday)- fried oreo (selected days, check their FB for availability)** As they only have 1 fryer or something, fried oreo will not be available on Wednesday when it is Buttermilk fried chicken night.**What I ordered in the end:Espresso Bacon Burger- \u00a0It was medium like I ordered, pinkish in the center and charred outside. It was a huge ball of meat which sadly fell apart once I sliced it. So I was picking up minced meat the entire meal. The espresso bacon jam just had a hint of the coffee and bacon taste, so mild that it was quite forgettable. Being a jam, it was a bit sweet but I liked it as a foil to the meat and bun. The hand cut fries were alright though looked very dark. I was expecting that as it was written in the menu that it would look dark as they were fresh. Pork chop ordered by friend was said to be good. She liked it. I had iced lemon tea which was freshly brew and sugar syrup was left on the side. I would not mind going again if I am in the area, but I would not go there specially just to dine, but maybe on a Wednesday just to try the buttermilk fried chicken.",

Breakfast remains to be decent but I feel that it's bordering on the decline.The menu used to be interesting and imaginative. Now it's mediocre and boring. Portions are small and like other Yelpers have mentioned, it's overpriced. Never once when I came did the chef or the owners who are sometimes at the premises asked the diners if they are happy with the food.The joint is not often full. Hence instead of texting away on their phones or having a smoke, it pays to ask the customers what they thought of the food if they wish to cultivate repeat business. The staff is often very friendly and cheerful. I do miss the long hair girl with the braces. She's the sunshine of the lot. I used to recommend the Little Diner but I doubt the joint is barely keeping up its former glory. It's now just a restaurant trying to make money. Not returning.",

The Red Velvet Pancakes... unfortunately didn't quite live up to the expectations of my friends that love this place. I can see how the pancakes would be in in theory, except when I ordered them they were a little undercooked. Undercooked pancakes taste of soggy flour/batter and really no amount of cream cheese or syrup is going to cover that up.That said, my date's Eggs Benedict was pretty good though a little on the small side portion-wise and we were left wondering if we should order more or head somewhere else. In the end we decided to head somewhere else for a burger, but funnily enough I'd stlll be very willing to try Little Diner again just because the service was so friendly.Good people and good service save any dining experience, and I think this was no different. The team there deserve a second chance!",

First sign of trouble was the plating of all the dishes. Token salads, stacked and skewered food looked like compensation of some sort and turned out to be the case.I did note some rather inspired moments on my plate. I did like the fries and the coleslaw that came with my dish, but to serve fried chicken looking and tasting burnt was quite beguiling. I even finished it. Limpid, supplier-style Oreo Cheese cake was not and remained half eaten. A friend's pork chop looked robust but was an unexpected star anise party-in-our-mouths. We were left unsure about that. His apple crumble on the other hand held no surprises, but in a good way.I suggest the owner take a long, hard look at rivals on the market and see what they deliver against what they promise. Right now the output of the kitchen can't cash the cheques. Could have been acceptable in the 90's. Not anymore, not at this price point.I would suggest to lose the gimmicks and get some basics right. Otherwise a great location for a diner. I wish them all the best and hope they keep working at it.",

    "text": "Decided to try out this place just up the road, and we were able to snag a reservation for their last table on Saturday night.The menu looked delicious, and we actually got to take our time and look at them, because they brought out kids menus too. \u00a0Not just any kids menu, mind you, a kid's menu glued to the back of a magna-doodle! \u00a0BRILLIANT! \u00a0Not only did the kids get to pick from smaller versions of all the good stuff on the menu, they had a toy at the table to keep them entertained until the food arrived. \u00a0We got an order of arancini or fried cheesy rice balls to tide girls over. \u00a0The only downside is it doesn't open for dinner service until 6 which is a little late for our girls, but the cheesy fried rice did the trick. \u00a0They were perfectly crispy on the outside, a little melty on the inside, but not so hot that the girls couldn't dig in right away. \u00a0Perfect!The girls shared orders of the mac n cheese and fried fish n' chips. \u00a0Warning: the mac n' cheese is a smaller version of the gorgeous grown up mac n' cheese they serve for adults. \u00a0It didn't go over quite so well with the littles, but I sat there salivating while they picked at it. \u00a0The fish and chips were perfect. \u00a0The fish had a crispy golden batter, not soggy at all, coating flaky white filets piping hot inside. \u00a0And the fries! \u00a0Skin on, small batch fried, light sprinkle of sea salt...oh, excuse me, I need to wipe the drool off my keyboard...I'd have expected no less from an Irish chef, though he labeled the dish as Boston style.The Hubs and I were both tempted by the Truffle and 'Shroom burger and were not disappointed. \u00a0Truffled aioli, cabernet and butter sauteed mushrooms, and a burger the size (and shape) of a baseball. \u00a0The bun was standard fare, but the rest was so delicious we couldn't put it down. \u00a0Nellie, our server and wife of the chef, came over and remarked how happy it made her to see us eating our burgers with our hands and really enjoying them. \u00a0I commented that I would continue being the crass American eating with my hands if it meant I could have that burger again and again. \u00a0Not sure how you eat a burger with a knife and fork, but apparently that's how it's done. \u00a0She quickly reassured us that it made her feel like she was back New York, and we continued our meal with relish. \u00a0Reasonable if small wine list by the glass, much more extensive list by the bottle and a decent selection of imported and craft beers and ciders. \u00a0My radler was light and refreshing. \u00a0Mr. tried the \"Yeasty Boys\" which he said reminded him of a Speakeasy, bold, very hoppy. \u00a0We were both quite pleased with the recommendations. \u00a0We finished the meal with some coffee, and Nellie surprised the girls with an early chocolate Easter egg filled with pastel M&Ms. \u00a0The M&Ms were a surprise and unfortunately a few hit the ground before K could right hers, but they were heartily enjoyed by both girls!I cannot say enough about the service in this place. Nellie was extremely personable, and very thorough with explaining which menus items I should avoid when I mentioned my lactose intolerance. \u00a0She even came back to the table concerned that the mushrooms being sauteed in butter might be an issue she hadn't considered, and was relieved when I told her it wouldn't be a problem. \u00a0She continually checked in with our table and engaged the girls. \u00a0Happily they were not the only children in the restaurant, and several more arrived while we were dining. \u00a0To have our children so welcomed at a restaurant boasting a menu & wine list suitable for a nice night out was a pleasant surprise for us. The other waitresses and staff were prompt in delivering our food as it became ready and in clearing unnecessary dishes. \u00a0They asked if we needed ketchup or mustard before we had to ask and even had multiple options. \u00a0These little details combined to make it a lovely dinner out for our entire family. \u00a0It is a great little diner pub and we will certainly be back! \u00a0I want my own order of those fish and chips!",

My items came out fast, which was a testament given the place was packed (98% locals, not that it matters). The bad: Not terrible, but the food wasn't great. My eggs benedict came out with 1 thin slice of ham on each, and one of the eggs wasn't cooked thoroughly. The hollandaise sauce was runny and forgettable, about the only thing holding it together was the muffin (acceptable) and the ground pepper that was sprinkled on top (table side, nice touch). My latte was tasty (hard to get that wrong) but too small. The ugly: Unfortunately, it's another Frankenstein restaurant that doesn't have it's own identity. Even the decor screams outdated (there was Halloween decorations still up almost a month after) and there were design concepts that I've seen around town. Not all is lost, but there is still much left to be desired.",

Perhaps it was due to the unusually large crowd that had showed up while we were there. Service was inattentive and fleeting and wait times were horribly long. We got our orders messed up at twice and they actually placed the wrong orders for us. When the food we ordered arrived, it was disappointingly lackluster and middling at best. The burger I had was all mashy and seemed a tad undercooked and my girlfriend's eggs were all runny and messy, nothing like what she had ordered.

    "text": "I wanted to like this place for 3 reasons:1) There are very few affordable brunch places near my home that serve mind blowing food and don't require advance reservations.2) It's called the \"Little Diner\"3) I saw red velvet pancakes and french toast and immediately thought of the Griddle Cafe on Sunset Blvd (yelp.com.sg/biz/griddle-\u2026)So what happened when \u00a0I ate there on Saturday afternoon?Service was great by East Coast standards, so I guess it fits with the New York theme. We (let's call him R) certainly appreciated the server checking up on us and serving water quickly when we got seated. +1 for using those umm... jar-mug thingies that the man and I used to use in college. We ordered the red velvet pancakes and eggs benedict and well, both dishes were kind of meh. My first reaction to the pancakes was wow that's a small stack. A small, thin-looking stack of pancakes that goes in-line with the \"Little\" in \"Little Diner\" I guess. I mean that's all I can really say about a stack of pancakes I ate in about 5 mouthfuls. It had some flavor to it but certainly wasn't the rich, dessert-like, thick and fluffy pancakes I was hoping for. The cream cheese frosting was on the side and didn't really taste like cream cheese (or at least what I'd associate with say a cream cheese frosting on cupcakes) and looked kinda awkward, as was the small swivel of cream. However, I must say the side of bacon was very, very well done. Super crisp, bubbling with oil, perfect. The eggs benedict that R ordered because of the honey ham in it was a benedict in name. The muffin was kind of tough and somehow the eggs and ham and hollandaise just didn't meld together and work. We've had some really insane benedict's at \u00a0Choupinette, Rider's and the Porch cafe in Bali and this version just didn't, quite, cut it.Bottom line, I'm checking this place off as tried and visited but am unlikely to return. It reminds me of the gastropub down the road - passable food and cool decor, but not enough to make me return again and again. For the price I'm paying I'm sticking with the stalwarts in the neighborhood, even if it means more effort on my part in making reservations.",
