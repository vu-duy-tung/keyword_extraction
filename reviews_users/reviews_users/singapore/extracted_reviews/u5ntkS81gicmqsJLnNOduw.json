    "text": "It has been a long while since I last ate at a Korean restaurant. We got here on a weekend night and the place was absolutely packed; fortunately we made a reservation in advance so we managed to get a seat rather quickly.The service here is pretty standard but good enough for me. First of all, we had a seafood hot pot which I felt was really delicious. The soup was sweet, not too spicy, and extremely flavorful. The ingredients inside included a nice big crab, shrimps, sotong, flour cakes and noodles. We also had the tofu pancakes, which was quite nice. But the other star of the show has got to be the ginseng chicken soup. The broth is probably one of the tastiest ones that I've had; you could just feel the goodness of the ginseng and the essence of the chicken flowing down your throat, and best of all, the soup is refillable!Overall, this is an excellent place to enjoy high quality Korean food. Highly recommended!",

My friends and I often visit this place when we are in mood of korean food in the Katong area. \u00a0The restaurant dished out homestyle korean food at a decent price with refillable the side dishes. One of my favorite is their Ginseng Chicken Soup which I never failed to order when I am there. \u00a0There are many of the other must-have there such as their bulgogi and kimchi pancake. This restaurant has been growing in popularity and it can get very crowded. Do make reservation before you or expect a wait.",

    "text": "My friends and I were looking for Korean after work by the Katong I12 mall since most of us live in the area. I found this place on hungrygowhere/yelp...most of the other places in the area were buffet bbqs and one of us is vegetarian. The place is about a 4-5 minute walk away from I12 and sits along side many other restaurants on East Coast Rd. The inside wasn't big and no-frills but looked clean with some cutesy/philosophical bad English on the wall.The experience was a bit tainted by our server in particular:Two of us sat down first, since the rest of our party hadn't arrived yet. We started ordering some appetizers and asked for some water, since we were pretty hungry. The odd thing is a mom and a kid came in after us, and they served them the Korean side dishes, but they didn't bring us any side dishes (even after we ordered appetizers to start until the rest of our party got there) like they usually immediately do after you sit down at a Korean restaurant. Even though we asked for water, we were hoping that they would've automatically brought us a jug of tea water, which was clearly visible in their glass door fridge. Once we saw that the other table had some side dishes, we asked our young male waiter for some, and he just had this look of attitude like \"fine, I'll bring you your side dishes.\" Throughout our meal, including the ordering process, he was not proactive at all and had a bit of attitude. It was like we were working for our service by asking for things a waiter should've proactively offered. The female waiters weren't serving our table exactly, but they were a bit more proactive by moving some of our main dishes onto the next connected table, since we were running out of space (we ordered too much).Overall, the food was middle of the road, and this is probably not going to be my default place for Korean in Katong (was hoping there's a good Korean place in the neighborhood instead of just Tanjong Pagar). The price is pretty standard...not too pricey -- we paid about $32/person for 4 people. We ordered & shared the following:vegetarian kimbap (satisfying)potato pancakes (these were the best!)beef bulgogi (ok)spicy chicken bulgogi (order by friends and I didn't try this)japchae (pretty good)budae jjigae (I think I've had better but this was a great sharing dish)tofu soup (order by a friend and we all didn't try this because we had too much food)...side dishes weren't like \"yummy!\" but still appreciated",

    "text": "This might be one of the best places to head to when a carb craving attack descends. Recommended items are the jajangmyeon and ginseng chicken soup. Firm wheat noodles reminiscent of mee pok is topped with a thick, heady sauce chock full of diced pork and vegetables, topped with an egg done sunny side up. The ginseng chicken soup is full of medicinal goodness, and when the wait staff cut open the chicken, the glutinous rice stuffed into its cavity spills out, clouding the soup. So I've been told that glutinous rice is good for warming the qi. Really? It sure warms one's stomach on a cold day. Wash everything down with a pot of korean rice wine, or makkoli. The milky alcohol is light and sweet, and complements the heavy jajangmyeon nicely. Kimchi can be tapow-ed too, at $8 for 500grams of fermented anti cancer goodness. When Doong Ji gets busy, as it does every evening, the wait for a table can take half an hour or more. Customers who mill around tend to get a little irate as the storefront is narrow, and traffic directly outside can be quite agitating. Add this to the other seated customers stuffing their faces, well.. their annoyance is hardly unreasonable. And this being Katong, you'd have better luck finding parking elsewhere.",

Not a big deal for most people, but for me it's a matter of principle, and one of the reasons I rarely ever go back. Be prepared to pay cash for bills below $30. Come early. Last order is at 9:30 and as couple of times we've been hassled to order quickly or finish our food quickly by staff.",
