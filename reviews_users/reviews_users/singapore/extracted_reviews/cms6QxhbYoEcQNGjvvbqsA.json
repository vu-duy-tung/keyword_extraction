    "text": "The good reviews held true for me when we dined there tonight.They allow you to choose your spice level and if you're the type who enjoy the spice of Chilli padi as a soy sauce dip, without eating the actually padi, level 2 should be your threshold. I was too conservative and ordered level 2 but realized I could have probably handled level 4 or 5 easily. The curry sauce was indeed generous in amount so unless you drink the curry by the spoonfuls, there's enough curry to finish the rice. The omelette rice was as the name suggests, rice being covered by thinly fried eggs that wraps the rice. The result was a layer of fluffy and flavourfull egg that really adds to the overall taste of each bite. Very light and fluffy and well seasoned!Coupled with the curry taste, I can understand why many people have good things to say about the omelette rice. I love the pork Katsu side as the pork Katsu strips remain crispy and tasted so good in the mouth!I am definitely returning with my family to have another satisfying meal!!",

It has a great lunch set offering, the ability to choose your spice levels, but unfortunately, my cutlery was dirty with stains, and something did not sit right with me with my curry - I ended up getting sick for two days after dining there. My colleague also mentioned he wasn't feeling great following the meal. Food is of good value and portion tho. I just thought I'd share my experience with no bad intentions. :)",

But the omu rice looks too good to be missed and I was in the mood for seafood. I like how the omelette is still slightly uncooked, making it still runny. But I wasn't sure if the squid was fully cooked since it was still soft to touch and the color doesn't look right. The rest of the seafood doesn't taste the freshest too. Other than that, I will still be back for omu curry rice but definitely skipping the seafood option.",

Obviously don't come here if you want fine dining.I consider myself an adept eater of chili, and the level 2 curry was just about right for me.",

I really like the fact that you can choose varying levels of spiciness to suit your taste. The cutlet was done nicely with a nice crunch to it. Overall an awesome place for lunch if you're looking for japanese curry rice! Be warned! its craving inducing(for me at least!).",

    "text": "Everything with curry & I am not complaining. The curry sauce was good! We had the chicken cutlet, prawn cutlet (my favorite), fried chicken pieces and shredded pork dishes ... all topped with Japanese curry and served with a side of Japanese rice (not the ones they use for sushi, but still stickier than normal rice). I would have preferred if they separated the curry and meat, instead of pouring the former on top of the latter which made the fried meat soggy. Otherwise, everything else was good. The chicken cutlet was fried to perfection! The bread crumbs were golden, flaky & crispy. However, the chicken meat was pretty blend. I guess it wasn't marinated since it was going to be dipped in curry anyways? I would recommending going for the prawn cutlet for more flavor (it sorta taste like a tasty thai prawn fishcake). On the table among the condiments, there a jar that held chopped pieces of tomatoes. They taste like Japanese pickles, a little sour but sweet too. I think they complimented the curry dish in an unexpectedly pleasant way and left me longing for more. Give it a try if you are there :)",

    "text": "Ok so I've been to this restaurant in Tokyo and it's ok there, not as good as Go Go curry, but ok. But the outlet in Singapore really sucks, for a few reasons.1. The tonkatsu was OBVIOUSLY refried. Overcooked, dry and unappetizing. The 1st one I received was so bad that I asked for another one. The rehash wasn't much better so I realised that re-frying is their standard.2. The service sucked, waiters with an attitude is just not worth the effort.3. When on the way out I happened to see the chef taking some of the chicken karage from the microwave oven (reheat) and placing onto the plate with his bare hands. Now I am ok with them handling uncooked food with bare hands, as the cooking process will kill any bacteria introduced, but as a final preparation step is not acceptable.4. The curry sauce is really substandard, it's the type you can buy from a $2 shop. Monster curry (formerly Go Go curry in Singapore) is so much better....Be warned....",

They offer a variety of curry sauces, and each tastes a little different depending on the ingredients (which I like, because I hate curry houses that uses the same curry for every kind of curry). For those who like it spicy, this place offers a surprisingly spicy curry (if you order hot) for a japanese curry place (you know we've always snickered about how japanese curry is never hot...). The omu rice was a little disappointing though. Instead of a soft, fluffy omelette cover, you get a thin slab of omelette. Four stars because the curry is good tasting and the rice is good.",

I think Coco Ichibanya is nice enough for its price but it is not a place that I will recommend to my friends. The service was great as the manager took his time to explain the menu and the variations of spiciness. They were good at topping up our water too.However, the amount of pork in my curry was just too little. It was like 8 tiny pieces of pork that were swimming in the huge portion of curry and rice. The curry was nice enough but the general quality of the pork and rice was just ok. They will get four stars from me when they do decide to double the amount of meat but not the price of course.",

I think the curry gravy compares reasonably well with other chain Japanese shops at this price level. It's also better than making a box curry like the House brand. \u00a0The tonkatsu is fine but typical, as other Yelpers have said. The chicken kara-age was actually much better than I expected. It was also really convenient to get different levels of spice and different things in the curries I ordered for our different preferences.Let me add that the takeaway set up works nicely, too. \u00a0They use a special container that separates the rice, meats, and curry sauce. The omelet on the rice was still tender and at that \"just wet\" stage, and the gravy hadn't soaked all through the rice or softened the breading on the tonkatsu or kara-age. We could plate everything after getting home and it looked great and tasted fine.",
