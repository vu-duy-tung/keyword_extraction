    "text": "After looking at furniture for about an hour, decided to have lunch at the Ikea restaurant. It was near to 2pm, and there was still a queue extending back pass the drinks & coffee island. But luckily the queue moved fast.We ordered the 2 must do - the meatballs and the fried chicken wings. Additionally, we ordered the fish& chips and the confit of duck. We also had the Swedish fruit flavour drinks.The meatballs goes well with the sauce and cranberry sauce. There were lots of meatballs with a good amount of boiled potatoes.The duck was also good and it came with boiled potatoes and steamed vegetables (carrots). The duck meat was tender and goes well with the given sauce. it was tasty. You get an entire duck drumstick. The chicken wings was crispy and moist. It was marinated very well and was tasty. It was very good.The worst dish was fish and chips. It mediocre and basic. You get a breaded fish with chips. It came with the normal tartar sauce. The fried part of the fish was crispy but overall it was rather cold probably it was dished on the plate out of the heating lamp waiting for some poor customer to take it.The Swedish fruity drink was refreshing as it was very fizzy. Unfortunately Ikea does not provide ice at this location. So the cold drink quickly became room temperature while you dig in to the main course. It was very refreshing and cool when you first got it from the dispenser. It seems that all drinks are refillable",

Well, the ribs are a generous slab of about 5 ribs. Tasty wise is ok but a tad too dry. It's without sauce so the overall pretty dry. The other dishes are well covered so I won't add on. I'll be back definitely!",

Most of the dishes worth having are \"Western\" but the curry is among the best that you can get in a fast food-ish place. Free flow soft drinks for a dollar as well as free baby food. Can't deny that my wife and I are just in love with IKEA.",

The foods here are affordable but you do everything yourself, from queueing up, to getting your food, all the way to clearing your own table, but for the affordable prices they offer, you can't really complain. It is also children friendly, with a special corner allocated for families with children, complete with baby chairs and toys to entertain them while the parents have their meal.They do great swedish meatballs and their chicken wings are especially yummy too! They often have set meals that are worth getting and drinks are refillable! Their desserts are also pretty cheap and interesting. Try their Daim tart! Sweet and nutty goodness in every bite!",

    "text": "This may seem strange but I literally come all the way down the IKEA exit bistro just to get cheapo but tasty hot dogs.I find the prices here absolutely ridiculous for a filling meal. At $1 a hotdog I never stop at just one, or two. A hotdog and a drink sets you back a mere $1.50, so you're set for a complete lunchtime bite. You even get the thrill of squeezing the sauces out of the udder-like contraptions, which is always \u00a0fun sight for kids. You could even get a soft serve ice cream cone here for 50 cents, and you know they'd do it better than Macdonalds does it. Despite their limited menu I really adore how quick and efficient everything is, and the fact that I can have a very filling and satisfying meal for under $5. What I usually do is grab meself a hotdog and walk around their little food collection next to the counter so see what Swedish food tempts me. An entertaining lunch in a very odd way!",

    "text": "I've always been a greater fan of Ikea's food rather than its furniture, and its bistro is the greatest reason why. The bistro strangely epitomizes the proud qualities of ikea- fuss free, brainless assembly and shopper friendly. Things are kept simple here: you first place and pay for your order at a counter, then move along in a somewhat production-line fashion to wait for your food to be prepared upon presentation of your receipt. The magical part is there is hardly ever a queue so you are literally seconds from a hot steamy sausage bun.The hotdog is of course the best seller. Its so ridiculously simple, cheap and good it makes you realize those people paying for $5 hotdogs outside zouk must be seriously drunk. It consists of a boiled medium length chicken sausage (ain't no bratwurst) sandwiched between a fresh bun, and you move on to dress it with the sauces of your choice, my favorite being an excessive amount of mustard and chilli sauce. Since last year they have also introduced a chilled chocolate doughnut that is not mind blowing but still sweet enough to fix that sugar craving.The only thing I never liked from the bistro is the signature lingonberry drink. It tastes so weird and doesn't appeal to my Asian palette at all. I have never met anyone who likes it, I wonder why they insist on keeping it on the menu. Also, I don't think the drink goes well with the food on the menu because I truly think a hotdog is best enjoyed with good ol coca cola!",

    "text": "Enough said , when you think of Ikea, immediately the swedish meat ball will be the top of mind. Everything here is self service, ranging from collection of eating utensil, food to clearing of tray.The meat ball comes with their own sauce as well as their lingo berry jam which taste lovely when you eat them as a whole. if you are a fan of the jam, you may request for more sauce. Another food not to be miss is the fried chicken wings, it is well marinated , sinful as it may seem, one will succumb to indulgence. Also, for sweet tooth, the dessert section offers unique pastries and cakes, one of them is the princess cake that is covered with a sweet green kaya layer.During rush hours, tables might be hard to get and queues might be long but the food is definitely worth the hassle.",

They have expanded their offerings to include a selection of local and other Swedish options, with a daily evolving menu so one is almost always guaranteed to be able try something new.Food : The meatballs are a mixture of beef and pork meatballs. Accompanied by a tasty gravy and lingonberry jam with a side of steamed potatoes, it is one of the signature dishes of the restaurant. The fish and chips are quite good, as is the poached salmon. The chicken wings are pretty awesome and the baked chicken leg comes in a generous portion. The soup changes daily but are usually quite decent. There are also daily breakfast options from 9am with a selection of pancakes, hash browns, scrambled eggs and waffles.Ambience : Busy and casualService : Self service but the IKEA staff serving at the counter are pleasant",

Other than the crowdpleasers (meatballs, chicken wings), watch out for their specials, though not everything is worth eating (to wit, their Swedish crayfish special was meagre). And save room for dessert! Daim pie (yes Daim as in the candy) is a favorite, as is princess cake when it's available. If you like the food, do check out the food shop downstairs, because a lot of that stuff is available frozen to bring home.",
