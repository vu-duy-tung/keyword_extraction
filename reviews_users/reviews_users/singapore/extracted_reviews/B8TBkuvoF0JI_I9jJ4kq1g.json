I would name this place as the best boiled chicken and rice place in Singapore. Not only the chicken was incredible but their super flavorful rice is what put it over the top. In addition they have other amazing authentic dishes. Definitely try their soup selection. Highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Came here and dined for two. Ordered their roasted chicken for two and had the hong kong kailan (the one with oyster sauce). It was a great meal. The clear soup wasn't bland, so it actually added flavor to the rice. The chili and garlic were great too. the kampong chicken was succulent and juicy, the rice was fluffy and not hard / dry. The kailan was sliced thinly, so it's not a chore to eat the stems. And the oyster sauce was generous. It was a great lunch, except for one gripe. The lady kept taking away our chili / garlic and putting it on a different table. Yaaaa I mean we've taken some in our saucers, but then every time we wanted more, we'd have to call for service for her to take the tray back to our table, then she'd take it away again. And so we had to ask for it again afterwards. So I just gave up. Haha. Sad. But that's the only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star. Maybe there are better chicken rice places, but if you're in the katong / joo chiat area, this is definitely one to try (and compare to your favorite chicken rice place).",

Nothing too overcooked nor tough, all is right which explains my frequent visit and in all fairness, i did try other places (refer to other reviews). Someone in her review mentioned about their chicken being too dry- im not sure if she was being served beast meat or thigh but you are welcomed to inform the staff which part of the chicken you prefer. As for unfriendly staffs, as with all humans, during peak hours they can get busy trying to serve everyone but they are definitely not unfriendly. Comon, cut them some slack, they are in service line. All in all, i will be back! P.s. Their salted egg pork ribs is a must try!",

My friend and I came here for dinner and ordered the hainan chicken rice with the pork ribs in egg batter (I think that's what it was called?). Super yummy and service is very much quick and efficient! When you order the chicken, you can select your cut of what kind of chicken meat you want, and it comes with some pickled vegetables and a serving of chicken soup. Seating is outdoor and there are fans everywhere so you manage to stay cool.

And given that Five Star is of closest proximity to my abode, it's no wonder that this is my first pick when poultry cravings hit. Cool, silky tender chicken atop a mound of soy sauce and sesame oil drenched cucumbers. Hot, fragrant rice. Spicy, garlicky chili. A generous serve of steaming soup. There's nothing missing in this picture, really. Sure, it's as unglamorous as they come - sitting out next to a busy road with auntie waitresses squawking orders overhead, but the bustling ambience of being in the presence of famous food is unbeatable. Price wise, it's not cheap, but neither is it exorbitant. And if only visit sporadically, it's all the more worth it to splurge, both in terms of calories and clams.",
