    "text": "Mexican food in Singapore? I'd been on the hunt for months and hadn't found anything decent. Vatos looked promising, so I headed in for lunch one afternoon. I found it to be just tolerable in terms of food, but was pleasantly surprised by my drink. \u00a0I got the cowboy margarita. It tasted great and was pretty strong by Singapore standards. There's also a little beer selection in addition to the cocktails. The chicken fajita burrito was disappointing. Its mild spice was the only redeeming quality. Underneath that spice is a bland excuse for a burrito. The chicken was gross and the vegetables indistinguishable. There was some appetizer that was basically fries covered in slop. Again, pretty bland. Large portions. My grandparents were in love with this place. The entire meal they were making comments about how they wished they had Vatos in the US, the fries are SO GOOD, just the right amount of spice, tacos look authentic etc. It was nice to see them enjoying a meal with such enthusiasm. But these are people who voluntarily eat at Aztecas (American \"Mexican\" chain restaurant). I could definitely recommend this place for drinks, but I'd avoid the food if you've had legit Mexican before. As a bar, 4 stars. As a restaurant, 2.",

Food quality is very good, meaning the ingredient, I'd say 4, but it isn't your traditional zesty, spicy and fresh Mexican food which they actually claim not to be a Mexican restaurant. When someone says tacos my mind goes to Mexico, spicy zesty fresh... \u00a0You won't get it here. If I want to be critical then this place lacks of food identity. If I want Mexican I won't come here, if I want Korean I won't come here, if in mood for Asian fusion same thing. Staff very friendly, attentive, they do happy hours 12-7pm, 1 for 1 which I think will end once they establish themselves but great nevertheless... I miss ceviche on the menu. Ambience is cool, hipstery and industrial... Go try I would love to see your opinion.",

Though the food was unlike the original in Korea, we still enjoyed the kimchi fries and their specialty dishes. Good enough to sooth down our longing for Korea since we moved 2 years ago.The ambiance is more like a bar than a restaurant, with tall chairs and loud noise. The funny thing is it has a chic restroom with special touch-up section for ladies.Will we come back? May be.. That will be once in a year coz there are many other better Korean restaurants around.",

I was informed though that if I walked in, there could be seats available in the outdoors.Walked in at 6.30pm, outdoor seating was available. Chill, quiet atmosphere, quite different from the inside which seems quite lively yet cozy. However there is no shelter outdoor so fingers crossed that it does not rain! And just a minor detail, we found the stools outdoors a little uncomfortable.Food was received extremely quickly. \u00a0Serving seem small at first but was filling. \u00a0Recommend the fish tacos ($14 for 3) and the chicken chimi tacos($14 for 3)We were put off by the price of the drinks but when they were served, we had no qualms about the price for they were ENORMOUS. One drink should last you the whole night, no worries. Sharable if you don't want to spend 30 bucks on drinks as it is again, huge.Guacamole chips ($10) were underwhelming though, would have like it to have more lime and seasoning in it. More tortilla chips could have been served too, as I felt it was not worth the price for such a small serving. Next time, I would pass on the guac, which is a shame as every Mexican place should have great guac!Overall a very pleasant experience (not a first date option as eating can get messy) and was impressed by the excellent service! Could turn to be one of my fav places in bugis for a quite yet casual chill night out.",

This place seemed interesting so I gave it a try. I was seated promptly and greeted at the table by chips (fried whole corn tortillas) and salsa. I was pleasantly surprised with the red tomatillo salsa. Good flavor with just the right amount of spice. It tasted authentic. Tortillas (chips) were a little under-fried but still good. I ordered the spicy chicken tacos (orders come in 2 or 3 tacos), and wow! Nice, fresh chicken with a spicy (a little on the mild side for me) sauce and soft corn tortilla. Yes, it was different from authentic so-cal or Tex-Mex, but what do you expect from an Asian infused Mexican joint? I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food and this hit the spot. Paired with a Great White beer on tap and I was in Singapore heaven. Will definitely be stopping by again before I leave.",

Apparently half the staff eats at the tables in the dinning room at once. Maybe try getting takeout.",

I came by here on a weekday evening and was very satisfied with the food.Among the items I tried:- Kimchi carnitas fries: Highly recommend. Generous portion and flavorful taste.- Spicy chicken quesadillas: Great texture crispy on the outside. Inside was good but not as phenomenal as the kimchi fries- Pork urban tacos: Generous portion of meat served on tiny soft tortillas. Would be great if Vatos increased the tortilla sizes to help customers feel like they were getting what they paid for Overall great food in a casual fun ambiance. Would go back again if I could successfully secure a reservation like I did this time around.",

The prices are reasonable for Mexican food in Singapore and the Lost Coast brewery craft beers (or the frozen margaritas) compliment the meal quite nicely. The only knock is that I ordered Vatos couple times through Uber Eats and both times comes cold and incorrect - think it is more of an Uber issue that Vatos. This place is awesome overall!

Yum. (I just wish they wouldn't put lettuce in the tacos though- it ain't korean nor mexican...)Food comes out fast, and service is also consistently pleasant and prompt. Oh, and for your appetizer, they serve you deep fried tortillas with two sauces. The red roasted onion chipotle sauce was really good, however the tomatillo salsa verde was a bit off (can't remember, it was too bitter or smoky. And I'm someone that actually normally loves salsa verde and dislikes smoky chipotle salsas.)I wish they'd allow you to mix tacos (min order of 2 of the same kind), so you'd get to try more flavours. (2 is enough if you're sharing an appetiser) Ah well, guess I'm coming back again, which I really wouldn't mind.",

Granted the prices still aren't pretty (e.g. $17 for 3 tacos) but they still beat some other Mexican joints out there in Singapore and the level of fusion deliciousness is on-point.I wholeheartedly (and full-stomach-edly) recommend the quesadillas! Both the spicy chicken and prawn ones combined Korean and Mexican flavors in surprising ways and were very yummy. Extra points for the cool vibes (Vatos is secretly hidden away inside a nondescript white building). Can't wait to be back for dinner!",

LOVED the spacious and simple atmosphere, added with awesome Korean Mexican fushion that you just don't see in Singapore. until now. I used to frequent this place during my stay in Seoul (mostly the one in the basement of the Galleria mall) and the food is high-quality, full-of-flavor, messy and delicious. It's a different style of Mexican fusion from what you get in California with the gogi trucks- it's a less-spicy and healthier (with more veggies and ingredients) that truly fit the Korean palette.MUST:kimchee fries. you can't go wrong with this one. quesadillas. tastes like the ones back home in Cali!(tacos were okay, but i am biased bc i've always favored the authentic Mexican tacos over the fusion ones)Vatos magaritas! It's pricey- at around $20+ per drink, but it actually turned out to be double or triple the normal margaritas you'd get elsewhere. the upside-down beer in a margarita kept the drink flowing and it was just a fun drink to toast with friends. Will be back! Singapore life is getting better and better.",

Our small stomachs are to blame though! The kor-mex fusion is done very nicely; almost bringing me back to LA / ItaewonI wouldn't recommend seating outside though - i think that's where the kitchen ventilators get released , it smells too much of oil for my liking.

And when you combine those two cuisine? Wow. Speechless. The MUST eats include:* Kimchi fries - sounds funny, but imagine savory fries with an extra spicy cake from the kimchi. The kimchi did not appear to be aged for too long so no sourness here. Just a bit of tart and an extra kick of spicy. * Shrimp tacos - loved this! Though I'm not sure if the tortillas were made from flour or corn. Perhaps a combination of the two? I prefer corn but the prawns were so large and juicy that all is forgiven * Quesadillas - my gf loved this dish so much that she ordered it twice. Both for herself. * California Salad - got give some love to my home state and the salad is pretty great. Win-win all around (especially when you start thinking of about the carbs + fat + cheese + calories on the menu). The MUST drinks include:* Vatos magaritas, aka, a large magarita with a bottle of beer popped in -try \"Grow a Pear\" or \"Sexy Sanchez.\" (Please don't Google the latter until you've tried the drink.)* Texas Tea - This thing was HUGE! Not a surprise as it includes 6 kinds of liquors. I usually finish my cocktails in about 30 minutes, but this baby lasted me the whole night so it's worth that hefty price tag. I also tried the Mexican Martini but it was too sweet for me. This came as a surprise since it was a martini and I'm a lady. Perhaps those with a sweet(er) tooth would enjoy the Mexican Martini more. The atmosphere is great...almost like stepping into a TexMex steak house. I also love the concept of an open kitchen. The open bar helped as well. Seating-wise, be prepared for stools and no place to hang those handbags. My lady friends and those with bad posture/backs/necks, you have been warned. Oh yea, the bathroom is located upstairs so you'll need to walk outside of the restaurant, hop into an elevator, and go through a club before you can reach your destination. Vatos will definitely make a mark in the Singapore food scene, especially since Korean + Mexican fusion has yet to be witnessed and tasted by most locals and many expats. Coming from California, this fusion isn't something new (heard of bulgogi tacos anyone? Soooooo 2003.), and would satisfy the cravings of old timers like myself. Can't wait to return and make Vatos a daily stable in my diet. Psssst...Vatos is located below Vanity. Eat here before drinking and partying.",

They serve a variety of different tacos, burritos, enchiladas as well as some other larger dishes.The tacos I sampled were all great but the Galbi Short ribs and the Barbacoa Pork where in a league of their own. If you like spicy do also try the chimichurri chicken. To make things even better they have a great beer selection and the cocktails looked interesting and not the mention huge. Will come again!",

So here's my break down 3 stars for food. It was just \"ok\" in my opinion but to be fair I'm from the land of Mexican food and Korean street tacos. 4 stars for alcohol and beverage selection. The margaritas made me feel like I was back home. I will definitely be back for drinks and maybe some appetizers. I do wonder where they get their avocados from tho lol",

Next, visualize the worst American-style Mexican you ever ate there. Maybe it was a place called Panchos. Maybe it was Senor Pedros. Who knows, it was bad. Maybe you went in, got some refried beans from a can with some instant rice, some tasteless generic salsa, a burrito that was 95% filler. And you remember being annoyed at wasting ten bucks. Now, think of a restaurant that tastes literally two times worse, and costs $120 for two appetizers, three drinks, and one burrito. That would be the amazing restaurant that is Vatos in Singapore.",

Since we came all this way, we did not want to improvise so we said we would order for \"take-away\". Luckily a table opened up during our wait because the expected wait time is between 30 minutes to 2 hours. Judging from the crowd, anticipation filled our hungry souls. The menu isn't extensive but enough to make you ponder about what to order. We looked at the menu for a good 10 minutes before we decided on what to order. Dinner- all of us got the Fat Bastard burrito bowl. This was our favorite thing here. My colleagues and I couldn't stop raving about it. The rice, the sour cream, the beans, the carne asada was beautifully and deliciously executed. The kimchi fries were pretty good; the kimchi had a kick and I loved the jalape\u00f1os. The fries seemed to come out of a bag though...The galbi no rice burrito I had the following day for lunch was packed. The galbi was tender and let's just say that it was too good to eat just half of it. I loved how tender yet firm the black beans are. The sauces that it came w/ only elevated the overall taste. No sauce needed. Craving a burrito bowl now!!!",

    "text": "I am a Mexican food lover. I am not a Korean food lover. I am an original cuisine lover. I am not crazy over fusion and its blings and gimmicks. I am a simple man with simple love for simple excellent food. I see the great reviews therefore I decide to try this place since I have never had any Mexican food in Singapore before. So I came here to try if the fusion between Korean and Mexican could be something that I love. I was overwhelmed by the choices of food on the menu actually. It comes to starter (nachos usually and chicken wings?), tacos, quesadillas, burritos (that I note none of the reviewers have tried?), drinks. Usually in great authentic mexican restaurant, you will know whether you want tongue, shoulders, chicken, fish, etc for each. Here there are many to choose with its description of the sauce and everything. Food 3.5/5I opted for the barbacoa pork shoulder taco with vatos special sauce and yes they are pretty spicy. The taco is not using usual tortilla but something stronger to hold all the leaking meats on the taco, yes it is gonna get messy. Pork is tender, sauce is good, portion is generous, so great value for the money: 11$ for 2 tacos. I also ordered the pork kimchi quesadillas since it seems to be one of their main item and I note many of reviewers really love their kimchi fries. The quesadillas is not using tortilla, instead using the same ingredients of flour that make a Korean kimchi pancake. It is pretty crisp, cheese inside is melting, but pork flavor is overpowered by the sauce and everything else. It is quite pricey for 18$.Again I am more into a simple food that could bring forth the original ingredients' taste and texture. In vatos, it is being a fusion restaurant, the main attraction is the sauce at the end, even though yes, the meat is tender. But I believe that it is being prepped and cooked with care and love by the team :) it is not what I will definitely get to visit when I have the chance. Btw drinks is quite pricey and they don't seem to offer any happy hour. Service 4.5/5Venue 5/5 Great place to hang out since it is cozy and comfortable. Overall 3.5/5 :) it is a great place for anyone looking for something new and a fan of fusion food. All reviews are based on my taste for original Mexican food in San Diego and Jakarta/Bali with its Taco Local.",

The vatos burrito with kalbi(can choose different meats) was ok. Not great but ok. Kalbi, kimchi, fries etc sounds like it should be good but actually it's a bit too solid a food when compacted together. I want something more balanced. The kimchi fries were nice which is fries, meat, kimchi and cheese. Sounds similar ingredients to the vatos burrito but it's just better in that form. Looks like there are fun drinks here too. I would come back to try some other things.",

    "text": "After checking into my hotel, checked out Yelp to see what restaurants in the area may be appealing. When I saw a Mexican Korean fusion place with good ratings, had to go try it out. There were many reviews about the special, the Korean Kimchi fries but didn't try them out. Had 2 of the Korean pork bbq tacos instead. The tacos had a nice touch of sliced dikon/radish with good pickled flavors. The pieces of pork bbq were decent, though sliced a bit different than I normally see. They were more chunks of pork rather than slices of Korean Pork that you normally see. The Mexican flavoring was on the light side. Would've liked to see more salsa and spice to the dish. The salsa in the tacos was underwhelming. The chips that they provided as an appetizer was a nice change. Instead of chips as small pieces it came out as 3 large pieces of chips that you broke into pieces. But it was a bit on the stale side, maybe came at the wrong time as it was 3 in the afternoon once I made it out here after checking into my hotel. The salsa tasted like back home with the green chile verde and regular hot red spicy sauces.They did have nice craft beers though, didn't know they had these types of beers in Singapore. The place has a happy hour, or late night drinking and tacos or fries type of feel to it. Will have to come back with some colleagues for some food and drinks. Once I try the Korean Kimchi fries and some more drinks the rating may improve.",

I was seated at the bar right away, visiting right when they open at noon on a Tuesday. Immediately greeted by the bartender offering a nice selection of draft beers: curiously all American micros like Left Coast, Modern Times, and Stone. I was perusing the menu for only a minute before another staff member came by, asked if it's my first time, and made food recommendations. I ordered the prawn and pork belly tacos (2 each). Right away chips (which are three giant tortilla chips) were served with both green and red salsa, which were both very tasty with a bit of spice. The food came quickly and was presented simply: two tacos each on two small plates. The pork belly tacos are served with red and white onions, and are a bit sweet and very tender. Very nice. The prawn taco is similar to a fish taco you would get in San Diego, with cole slaw and salsa. The prawns are lightly fried. Tacos are $5-6 each, minimum two per kind per order and come on light tortillas. 4 tacos with the chips and salsa and a beer was plenty of food for me. Overall a five-star experience all around, from the service to the food to the ambience. Definitely check it out if you're craving tacos in Singapore.",

I don't even like beef and I tried the beef tacos. It's such a clever mix of Korean and Tex Mex that I never would have thought went together so well. This is mostly a meat eaters place but there are veggie and even vegan options!! The cocktails are also killer. In a good way!!! One massive cocktail with rice alcohol from Korea, tequila and juice and you're set for the next 2ish hours. I was told they do get quite crowded at lunch and even dinner time so if you don't want to wait it's worth it to make a reservation or at least try!! I wqs there at around 2/3ish and it was pretty empty, so late lunch and early dinner is a good time to come as well.",

You'll see this throughout Singapore. Vatos Tacos is a delightful Mexican/Korean fusion that offers a break from the oodles of noodles (sorry, couldn't help myself) and rice you'll consume whilst in Singapore. \"Chips\" (more accurately, tortillas) and salsa are complimentary with your visit. What I Got and What I Thought:1. Chimichurri Chicken Urban Taco \u00a0 \u00a0 DELICIOUS. Would absolutely have this again. The chimichurri was perfectly tangy and a great complement to the \"spicy\" chicken. While it did have a nice kick to it, I finished the tacos without a tingling sensation on my lips. As long as you can handle a couple of chilies you will be golden. If you're interested in a dish that has the fire emblem next to it, but you're worried about spice, just ask the waitstaff what you need to prepare for. 2. Honey Tequila Chicken Wings  \u00a0 \u00a0Best part of the meal and a great option to share with the table. As you could surmise from the name of the dish, the wings are sweeeeeeeeeeet, but they do come covered in slices of chilies. The heat-fearing members of my party were able to fully enjoy the wings by removing the chilies (this is a simple task). Vegan and vegetarian options are available!",

You wont sse abt signs of the restaurant unless you look for it on the side!We arrived at around 5:50pm for dinner. The restaurant was very empty with only two parties. I would say 90% of the tables had a \"reserved\" sign, so make sure to make a reservation ahead of time, or come early like us! We were seated and given the menu right away. The AC is super strong, and I was already feeling cold.We got the Spring rolls to start with, then the award winning tacos and the mango prawn quesadillas to share as our main. I passed on the drinks - SGD30 for a margarita?!?! It didnt seem to match the price of the food. Beer and cocktails are a lot more reasonably priced but I didn't want alcohol.After we placed our order, we got some crispy corn tortillas and dips along with our water. Really enjoyed the corn tortillas! Then the springs rolls came within 10 minutes, followed by our mains. The spring rolls were crispy and delicious, but slightly too oily. The bottom of the bowl has a thick layer of oil! The tacos were fine. I would complain it to be a bit too bland for mexican food, but since this is a kormex restaurant, it tasted ok. The \"award winning\" title got my expectation high. The quesadillas were mind blowing good! Again, not your typical mexican quesadilla, but fusion quesadilla. The top layer of the quesadilla tasted (and might actually be) toasted cheese! How delicous is that. Highly recommend.The service was meh. Unlike Canada, 10% tips is automatically included in the bill. Wasnt too thrilled about the service, the girls just stood around and sometimes stared at us while we ate. Would've been nice to notice that our glass was empty while staring before we had to wait and ask for it.",

Once I dig into the menu I was so excited to see that they had Vegan options. My Vegan tacos were super yummy, my husband had shrimp and chicken tacos which he loved. Our son had cheese quesadilla and he ate it all. My sister in law had shrimp tacos with pico on the side. She enjoyed, we all were very fond of the House chip and dip as it was fresh and the red sauce was super flavorful and my favorite of the two provided as we received a green sauce as well that our toddler liked since it was not as spicy. This place is a must do when in Singapore especially if you are a VIP member of my travel club as we earn travel upon paying our tab. WIN WIN WIN",

I mean, if I sometimes can't find good tacos in the USA, which is just north of the border from Mexico. How was I going to find real tacos in Singapore? ...But I was WRONG! Obviously not all of their menu is authentic Mexican; they do have a lot of tacos and dishes which are a fusion of Mexican with Korean and other styles. To keep it traditional, we order the Tacos de Carne Asada and to try something new had the Tacos de Pollo con Kimchi. The carne asada tacos were legit!!!! The meat was so tender and flavorful, the red salsa was spicy and delicious, and the tortilla was made to perfection. The carne asada tacos definitely made me think about my hometown of Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. The Kimchi Chicken tacos, were also really good and fresh, but I gotta say they were a little too oily for my taste, and could barely taste the chicken. It was definitely something I had never tried before and I actually kind of like it.Also, we were here on a Tuesday and they had a deal of 3 tacos for the price of 2 (#WINNING).",

This place really reminded me of the K-Mex type places in SoCal, especially Los Angeles. The ingredients are tasty and fresh, and the corn tortillas are rolled fresh in the kitchen. I usually get the kalbi short rib, korean pork belly and baja fish tacos, and the kimchi carnitas fries. It's that interesting spicy fusion cuisine that brings back memories of LA. (And its my choice of comfort food)Food and service standards have since dropped a bit since opening in 2016, but I have since been back regularly to satisfy my taco cravings. Vatos is a chain from Seoul, started by three former Korean-American California residents. One of the restaurant's founders Sid Kim was actually doing the serving and checking on the tables the night i visited in Jan 2016 when they had just opened for business. They have since expanded to another location in the West of the island, at Timbre+ in Buona Vista.Don't come in here expecting the authentic deal Mexican food and you'll be okay. (Which is best left to the experts at another restaurant.)5-stars in 2016, but has since fallen to 4-stars in 2018. Stars are relative to the quality of \"Mexican\" food you can find in Singapore.",

The food is horrible, drinks are non-local and overpriced, restaurant is dirty and they need more staff...Location is great, in South Beach area. Maybe that's the draw. From Austin and I know the Korean Mexican style cooking that is all the rage in Austin and SoCal, but these guys missed the mark.Kimchi Fries which is their main dish was inedible. The jalape\u00f1o barbacoa spring rolls were unique, but not too bad - thus the one star.When you pay, they take your credit card and then disappear for almost 20 min. I'll have to pay attention to charges now. One star for the spring rolls, zero stars for service, food and drinks.",

    "text": "Traveling alone on business with a free day in Singapore. After visiting the national museum I decided to stop here for lunch. Street tacos are pretty common back in the US, and this looked intriguing. I will admit, the bar is pretty high given the quality of this type of food back home but I thought I'd give it a shot. While I really wanted this to be good, there were several \u00a0negatives the first of which is they only will serve a two taco minimum. So if you're a party of one and you want to sample three different tacos, you're out of luck. It's only \u00a03 of one type or \u00a04 of two types, etc \u00a0 No big deal if you're dining with friends, but cut me some slack. I'm a party of one who really wanted to sample your food and you \u00a0wouldn't do it even with a \u00a0polite request to make an exception. So I ordered 3 pork barbecoa and they were delicious. \u00a0So delicious, I was wishing I could have tried some others. The \"Cowboy Queso\" on the other hand was so bland and tasteless it's as if someone just melted some plain cheese in a bowl. So we're batting 50 50 on food quality.Then there's the service. Kind of disinterested and bothered would he how I would describe it. Ordered a beer and a water with my meal and the water never showed. My server never showed again either and I had to all but stand up and wave my arms when it was time to go.It's a pretty nice place and the one taco I tried was delicious, but beyond that, there's not much to recommend here and given the negatives, I'm not sure I would come back. So much excellent food in Singapore, so lots of other options.",

    "text": "Finally made it for taco Tuesday!Four of us ordered the happy hour kimchi carnitas fries and 4 types of tacos.Kimchi carnitas fries - 3.5 starsGreat dish to share but we all didn't remember there was kimchi till halfway through. Perhaps there wasn't much kimchi in it to begin with.Galbi beef taco - 4 starsThis was my favorite! We gathered that it was slightly sweet, so those who weren't fond of sweet mains picked the prawn one as their favorite.Chili and lime prawn taco - 4 starsThis was my second favorite - the prawns were fried well and still crisp, warm and flavorful when I had them.Fish taco - 2.5 starsI don't know if it's because I had this after the prawn taco that by then it had gotten way too soggy and the breading was too thick and just tasted like oil. Granted there was a decent amount of fish in it.Carne asada taco - 2 starsToo spicy for all of us! Not much flavor I remember.$96 for 4 of us so that's a very decent $24 each. And I'm still full the morning after... does this make me 3-taco girl? D: not sure I'm dying to go back though. I guess I'd have to try their burritos. A bit noisy for dinner conversation and I'm getting to the age where I don't like yelling over the dinner table anymore...",

I thought it was a one off, where maybe the chef on that day was new or having a bad day, but I gave it two more chances and was still disappointed with the tacos. The soft tacos tasted too floury and the fish batter too thick and oily. You dont taste the fish. The only redeeming dish is the Honey Tequila Chicken Wings. Because of course you can't screw up chicken. Won't be back again.",

I have been back and it is still good. Tacos - the korean inspired ones were better than the mexican inspired ones, in my opinion. Finally - do you love raw onions? I mean, really really love them? Do you want to have an onion party in your mouth long after your meal is over? Then Vatos is the place for you! Run, don't walk. Make reservations, it's popular. Vatos is located in the old building part of South Beach, right next to Shaw Tower and facing Beach Road.",

    "text": "So where do I begin? Opened about a month ago, Vatos is definitely a cool spot to grab a bite and/or drinks. The margarita drinks look crazy with the inverted bottle of beer/cider plunged into the frozen margarita glass. As for the food, for me it's not something new and exciting. Roy Choi started the whole Korean taco theme in Los Angeles circa 2008, and it's been duplicated around the world. I'm still looking for \"the\" place in SG that serves up the Tex-Mex/Cali-Mex versions that my palate is familiar with. Don't get me wrong, Vatos is a great choice for asian-influenced Mexican street food. The tacos were, how do I put it? ... tasty but unsubstantial. Maybe I'm jaded by being from California, but ~$12++ for a couple of tacos is kinda pricey. The homemade tortillas were good but a little thin. The flavors were a mash-up of Mexican and Korean, which I enjoyed. The Kimchi carnitas fries were a bit salty. Don't know if the fries were salted, hopefully not, because the kimchi, cheese, and carnitas were already sodium loaded. Would come back again because there are things on the menu I still want to try. Mucho gusto.",
