The fish was super fresh and the grilled eel was cooked well.Their dinner options are a lot more expensive (~100+/pax). Have not been but for dinner so can't comment but I would expect good quality food as well though not sure if it would be as value for money as the lunch.Their signature dessert, a caramel ice cream is pbb the most underwhelming part of the meal - it's just a bit too sweet with nothing particularly memorableGiven it's a popular spot (apparently a favorite of Lee Kwan Yew) def make a reservations.Overall 4* (5* for value though if you go for lunch)",

I've tried all the michelin star japanese restaurants in Singapore and tbh, they are nothing special - just fresh fish flown in from Japan which is the same for Tatsuya. Try their legendary wagyu beef bowl. I special request that they add it for my omakase and they managed to do it.  E.g. Shinji doesn't even have meat dishes.",

    "text": "Went to Tatsuya for dinner on a Friday night. I was surprised to hear I could get counter seats for 2 even though I only called in the day before. We were greeted with great service from the moment we stepped in. I had the Chef special sushi set ($200) and my Friend ordered Udon, amaebi sashimi and 6 pieces of salmon Aburi sushi. We had some sale to go along with our meal as well. I wouldn't say my sushi wasn't good, but there isn't any wow factor that made me think \"Gosh I got to have this again\". I felt that way towards a piece of sushi at Murasaki and of course every single piece of sushi I had at Shinji. The sushis were fresh and presentation was great, but weirdly it was the udon that I would make a second trip for. I do like it when the sushis are presented piece by piece (Omakase style) with the Chef explaining what he is serving up but this was not the case at Tatsuya. Again, I know it's not fair to compare it this way and I reiterate that the food was good. Outlook wise, I personally didn't like that the sushi counter was looking abit messy and it was as noisy as a fish market. Perhaps I have been too spoilt with how immaculate Shinji maintains their counter and the ambience of a Michelin star restaurant. Still, it was a good dinner and the total bill came up to $400. Would I come back again? Yes but maybe for their lunch beef or Chirashi sets !",

    "text": "Hate to give restaurants low reviews but comparatively to sushi/Japanese spots of similar high price tier (and expectation), Tatsuya is a restaurant that feels like it cuts one too many corners in all its sushi quality, service and ambiance. Even though it has been around for a number of years, I have visited twice and would not at all recommend visiting here for any kind of sushi craving.I made a last minute Monday night reservation for my girlfriend and I where the waitress sat us down at the sushi counter in front of what I was assuming to be our chef for the night and we are given a few menus to look through. I was in the mood for a sushi omakase so we both requested the 10 piece order and awaited our meal. So many things wrong with this restaurant...1) As a starter, we were given salmon roe (ikura) in a mini bowl with a spoon to nibble through after which we began noticing the chef in front of us wasn't actually preparing our meals, rather the chef at the other end of the sushi counter was doing our food preparation (minus 1 star already - part of the fun of sitting at the sushi counter is seeing YOUR FOOD being prepared). 2) Then comes the part that irked me the most...they literally TORCHED 8 out of 10 PIECES OF SUSHI WE RECEIVED!!! This was highly unusual and we soon understood why, when we ordered some raw piece of sweet shrimp, we gagged at how fishy it was. There was even a part of the chu-toro that was left untouched and given to us, that even tasted awfully fishy. 3) On top of charring all these fishy pieces of fish, they use a bunch of garnishes. Mind you, this isn't like Sushi of Gari in NYC that is creative with their garnishes (but use high quality fish). They use garnishes that take a giant part of the flavor away from the fish (tons of mayonnaise for instance).4) This place will continuously serve your sushi on the same plate without wiping it off beforehand each time. So you essentially have this messy plate full of soy sauce. Any respectable sushi establishment will wipe your serving plate as this is the respectable way of serving sushi.5) Unce unce club music was playing as background music. Yet they attempt to present themselves as a top grade sushi establishment. There seems to be an identity issue here, this isn't a Ku De Ta (Ce La Vie) where they are actually meant to be a hip loungey type Asian fusion place. 6) Service was awful and waitresses (and chefs) are Singaporean and not Japanese. Even when presenting us the sushi, the chefs simply said \"this is another part of Yellowtail\" and went back to serving someone else. Lots of arrogance. We stopped caring since everything was torched to know the difference. If you take a minute and look across the 3 chefs at the bar, they seem to really enjoy just kicking it and torching everything. If there is anything to recommend here, it would be the charashi don. Surprisingly this was done very well and it comes in a small size that you can accompany with most dishes. Given that they still torch some of the fish on it, if I had this by itself then maybe I would be more forgiving.They do have your more Westernized rolls and such so this can be a good visit for those who aren't familiar with real raw sushi and maybe that's why they torch everything as well - to make more appealing to non sushi lovers. This would be the only reason to visit.Unfortunately the price here is very high and comparable to Ashino, Hashida, or even Shinji so if you are willing to shell out $600-$700 for 2 people sushi dinner (without drinks), I hope you do not choose here hoping you will get what you are paying for.I would not at all put this in the top 10 sushi spots in Singapore but if you really wanted to come here, just make sure you know what to expect.",

So I ordered the $120 sashimi platter that includes sea urchin, ootoro, salmon, prawns, cuttlefish and yellow tail fish. It was good but still can't beat Shinji away! Haha. Despite its freshness I could not appreciate the cuttlefish sashimi though. As a person who dislikes wasabi, I fell in love with the fresh grated wasabi here; to my surprise it was sweet and no unappealing pungent smell at all! However, I'm still gonna give this place 5 stars!",

I went for the grilled beef and specifically requested that it should be cooked medium well...when it was served I looked at the pieces and discovered they were still pink and rare and raw in some parts.How can a kitchen accustomed to cooking grilled meat not be able to tell the done-ness of meat. There is a BIG difference between medium well and rare. At this stage I didn't want them to prepare a new one, I just wanted an answer....why were they not able to tell the meat was not cooked properly? And if they did know, why did they still decide it was fit to be served at all? This was a little surprising.Moreoever, as the head chef himself pointed out, the beef was sliced before being served...which means the kitchen could see the meat was undercooked. Again, what happened? Why wasn't anyone checking?Having a word with one of the Singaporean chefs, I found him to be insincerely apologetic. I requested the Japanese head chef to answer this question. They couldn't of course but the Japanese head chef was far more sincere. And that made all the difference.The Manageress too tried her best to pacify a disgruntled diner.I was a little surprised that even after cooking the meat and slicing it, they could not tell it was rare and pink and still served it.",

The starters included in the set menu were a disappointment though. There was a piece of frankfurter in some of the dishes; very strange as it tasted like a typical off-the-shelf variety and so so salty. The potato salad and salad greens were also uninspiring, as were the few slices of fruits provided at the end of the meal. We were seated at the communal table and had a grand time with the sushi chef who provided some interesting nuggets of information on fishes used in sushi and sashimi. So all in all, excellent sushi and service, lacklustre starters, pricey for the quality and amount you are getting. For that reason, we will be back, but probably not as often as we would like!",

It was very noisy. Felt like I was at the busy food court. Not from customers. All chefs and waitress didn't care when they put the bento box on the table. Bump! Hit! Knock!One more unpleasant moment. ANT!!!!!I spotted couple of ant on the dining table!I had to ask them to clean away. Most people ordered bento or sushi platter. Bento looked good with reasonable price. I think Shinji is much better to enjoy omakase. At the Shinji, I felt like they treated me very carefully. Better atmosphere, better quality of food and traditional but exceptionally creative food styling. I cannot help thinking about my wasting money. It was just $100 value but I've paid more than $300.",

Is it any wonder that they fly in fresh and exotic offerings direct from the renown Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo? No worries people, the fish is safe. Though I honestly don't care if radiation kills me as long as i get the yummiest sashimi! We decided to go with the Lunch Bento sets which were reasonably priced at $26 to 30++. Actually i would say that it's darn cheap. Somehow i had this idea that a meal at Tatsuya would cost a bomb (though we have paid a lot more for Japanese before).

I had the sashimi unajyu which was essentially an assortment of salmon, tuna and yellowtail sashimi coupled with unagi slices on rice and silky plain chawanmushi with yuzu zest. Not entirely impressive and I was getting a teensy bit disillusioned. And then our ala carte order of assorted aburi nigiri sushi came. Oh. My. God. Mindblowingly delicious! I especially LOVED the sake toro, hotate with foie gras, ebi and the otoro with tobiko. Amazing. This alone is worth coming to Tatsuya.Ambience : Fairly chic sushi bar. Good for a spot of lunch.Service : Not particularly outstanding.I'm coming back for the aburi nigiri sushi alone.",

We had a business lunch and as a result, couldn't sit at the counter, which I think is essential for aburi sushi because you want to eat it straight after it's torched. Unfortunately all of my sushi was cold due to the logistics of preparing sushi for a table of people all at once, so it's no fault of the restaurant. Even with my less than ideal sushi, I enjoyed the sweet shrimp and not-sure-what-meat with a strip of foie gras sushi. I couldn't get too curious with my food because the conversation was focused on the economics of corporate culture change in Japan. Food aside however, the service at Tatsuya was terrible. I think this is an important component of the dining experience, especially if the restaurant is targeting people who will pay for good food. I would say upfront that even as a guest, I felt embarrassed for my Japanese hosts. We were greeted by a waitress with a harried face (crossed eyebrows and a frown), who basically yelled at us for our reservation details. This isn't the loud and cheerful traditional welcome I'm talking about. More like spit your names out and stop wasting my time kind of welcome. Throughout our meal, I had the unfortunate opportunity to be served by this same waitress, who for goodness knows why, repeatedly shoved her hand past my face as she put drinks or food in front of me. To save you from agony, let's just say I was this ' ' close to losing my temper and that almost never happens when I consume excellent food. For that experience, I think Tatsuya deserves a three.",
