    "text": "So my Brit-mates sprung me a surprise visit in Singapore on a Tuesday - and they were flying out on a Wednesday! That warranted much worry as it meant I had only 16 hours to show them how awesome Singapore was. I initiated them to my lovely home country with an epic night-out in the BING style ... and kick-started my chain of bar/club-hopping with OverEasy - the first place which came to my mind!OverEasy is definitely my favourite chill-out bar in downtown Marina Bay. It is lovely both indoors (with a live DJ on most nights ... darkish romantic ambience) and outdoors. The crowd is a right mix of local and expat yuppies (the crowd DOES contribute a lot to a place's ambience and 'feel'). Get a table (there are couches or high tables) outdoors ... and sip your cocktail or wine while admiring the magnificent Marina Bay Sands. Be here at either 8:00PM or 09:30PM daily to catch MBS' light and wonder show from the comfort of your couch/stool (my touristy friends were quite in awe)!Drinks are priced quite decently as well. Good place to have a civilised drinks catch-up with friends before hitting Butterfac next door!",

I asked for regular fries, but got truffle fries which I hate. Also, I saw a few cockroaches running around which was rather surprising as I've never seen a cockroach in Singapore before. But I guess at least they enjoyed the food. If you're looking for a hotdog NEVER go here, I'm sure their other food isn't so bad though, we also had chicken wings which were pretty decent. Their cocktails are actually pretty yummy too. If it wasn't for them this place would get 0 stars.",

Opt for the outside seats - it may be a little more humid but it's easier to hold a conversation and airier to boot.The bar grub is good - my favourite is the famous cheese steak sliders which are small and 2-bite-sized. Food in general is also quite nice, though one might feel the more breakfast like food seems a bit pricey...Still, I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a nice night out with friends and beer!",

However, I really like OverEasy for its great ambience and the amazing al fresco seating area that overlooks the water, with a lovely breeze blowing through at times.The tunes they play here at are also pretty chilled out or funky. Very comfortable with the vibes here. Staff are attentive, even f they are sometimes a little slow.I've not eaten much here, but is tried the mini sliders here and they are pretty good! A juicy chunk of meat cooked to a medium rare perfection is nestled in between the buns. I'd definitely recommend coming here for a pre-party, post-dinner drink with friends.",

    "text": "One of the main draws of Overeasy is its location. Apart from the fact that it's conveniently located near Butter Factory, making it the ideal pre-drinking spot for those who can afford it, it has a wonderful sea-front view, facing straight into MBS (so obviously you get all the sights around it too).They have a great selection of alcohol to boot, collecting some favourites from around the world. One of my favourites is the Little Creatures pale ale, which isn't stocked at many places (I picked this taste up from The Plain, of all places).Overeasy also do surprisingly good food. I know their burger comes highly recommended, as do their slides, especially when the market closes below a certain index (then they go for $1!). I went for lunch once and enjoyed the breeze as I dug into the most perfect bowl of truffle mac and cheese with mushrooms. It's hard to imagine how something that sounds so simple can taste so amazing. I don't think it's just the 'whole truffle oil makes everything magic' idea, because the cheese was toasted to such perfection, topped with some crumbs to add a crazy mix of texture to the whole dish. The mushrooms were pretty good as well, not the cheap button mushroom sorts, but the nice kind you'd expect from a restaurant. Loved it so much. a Five-star dish if I've ever had one. Must try!",

    "text": "Overeasy is located right opposite Raffles Place and is easily accessible by public transport. Drinks during happy hour are decently priced. The secret though is to check the status of the Singapore stock exchange for the day - if the market ends down, the bar serves mini sliders at $1 per pop. Even in Singapore where food prices are relatively lower as compared to other developed cities, it is hard to find any other bar which can beat Overeasy. Overeasy is also located right on the bay front, making it the perfect spot to chill alfresco with your friends. The sea breeze ensures that you never feel hot and sticky, though you might want to style your hair accordingly (hairspray!!)",

You can see why it's so popular with the afterwork corporate crowd. In particular, Overeasy has a great happy hour. You get can 1-for-1 drinks including Kirin and Heineken on tap (that's just $7 a pint) and housepour wines and spirits. It's always a happy day when the market closes lower for the day (if you're not a trader) because Overeasy has a slider promotion where you can get these lovely mini burgers at \u00a0$1 each. The sliders are really good too. Proper chunks of sirloin with cheese sauce sandwiched by a bun, they go great with a beer.",

The menu has a good selection of food and beverages. Again, prices are a little crazy. My passion fruit iced tea was $10 and alcoholic beverages range from $18-$25. They do have \"happy hour\" but it's only for one particular drink each day. On the day I was here, happy hour only applied to whisky. Lol.

    "text": "One of my fav hangout place when in mood for some fancy burgers. Best part? They operate till late, 3am on a Friday night! Go for their signature truffle burger. I love how the beef patty integrates so well with taste of the cheese! Always looking forward to the burger. Ask for truffle fries if U're in for a little more truffle! However I would say that the standard and portion has dropped some fair bit. A pity but still good on the taste buds. Also ordered their buffalo wings with spiciness on a scale of level 2. Not too spicy for locals but definitely a bomb for foreigners. Disappointment of the entire meal was... The buffalo wings were uncooked!! Didn't ask for a change as the staffs looked under-manpowered. Overeasy Fullerton was quite obviously under staffed, but can't be helped as they're popular, sporting a large crowd with guests queuing for tables on a Friday late night! Had their chicken BLAT burger too, was quite appetising with the soury mayonnaise. The mayonnaise taste very much like the same kinda mayonnaise we can easily find from our 'neighbourhood' cafe haha.There's a lovely draw to this place. Maybe It's the droopy lightings. Maybe it's The 'hype' atmosphere and airiness of this overeasy chain. It's quite relaxing, u can watch MBS's laser show here too as it's right smack ooposite from MBS!",

Best to share it as it can get a bit too much after a while. The spicy wings are equally good. Spicy sour with the blue cheese dressing to neutralize the heat. The steak frites is delicious with the truffle fries and bearnaise sauce. Drinks are not watered down and juices are refreshing.Note: Service can be a bit slow. And I do not like their system where they need to hold your credit card (when you are not requesting the drinks to be on tab) just because you want to utilize the happy hour promotion. I don't understand why they need to do that, especially when credit card fraud is so common now.",

    "text": "We came on a weekday evening and chose one of the tables outside. What happened was really disappointing - it started raining and everyone just fled from their tables. We were all standing in the sheltered area. Plates, cutlery, glasses and beer bottles were still standing soaking the rain while the waiters hurried shifted the tables in one-by-one. It was almost amusing seeing them frantically trying to make sure the customers didn't run away without paying, and also to re-seat the customers who left stranded.Among the two of us, we shared two plates of mini burgers (I think it was 6 burgers on a plate), a caesar salad and a prawn pasta. I got an Asahi to go with the food. We first ordered a steak but the order didn't come after we had finished everything. My friend was gathering exasperated by the inattention of the waiters; we changed the order into another plate of mini burgers.Well, he really did enjoyed those burgers, which I hear is famous over here at Overeasy. I found them to be just okay - i like burgers with leafy salad, tomato, cheese and all. These burgers only had a patty (it was like a cut of steak and pretty juicy, though slightly too cooked for my liking) enclosed with two buns and a toothpick to hold it together.The salad was just okay, I think I can make better salad lolCan't remember what the white sauce on the pasta was but the prawns were really fresh! It was moderately okay, and it did remind me of the copious amounts of pasta I used to eat (and make myself) when I was in the States.The bill came up to 50+ per person. A little ex, but considering the nice location (you can see the whole marina bay front from the dining tables outside), it would still recommend this place.",

However, I was hungry so I wasn't about to send it back. So sorry to the person who got jipped with my burger. (Sucker... Wha?)Since it was a busy Friday night, the staff seemed a bit stretched out. Service wasn't good, as they forgot to give me a bottle of ketchup, no one checked up on us after we got our food, and it took a while to get the check.

    "text": "I've heard a lot of good things about this place but I've never had a chance to check it out until recently. Everyone recommended the \"To die for\" burger.For a $20 burger, it was a bit on the small side, with a small pile of fries on the side.The burger was not bad but nothing to die for... I liked that it was a substantial, meaty burger patty and not the mushy stuff you tend to get at a lot of joints in Asia (think Mos Burger).After I finished my lunch, I was still a bit hungry.This place is just okay in my books.",

    "text": "This place is very noisy especially indoor. There is air conditioning too but the doors are open and the place is packed. Kinda stuffy. Being lazy people, we decide to settle our dinner there too. I ordered a spicy linguine and my friend a burger (can't recall the exact name but it's their popular burger). My linguine was not bad, springy pasta and prawns. The spiciness doesn't overpower. But for the burger, it wasn't quite what we expected. My friend requested to change the fries to salad. The salad was a pile of arugula with dressing. Won't it be boring to have one kind of green in the salad, in terms of mouthfeel and taste? At least that is what we thought. Midway through, we changed to outdoor seats. Which is way better as it is fresher air and music isn't confined. Great view of the skyline and laser show at MBS that go well with a pint of beer. Oh, and thumbs up for the attentive server for the outdoor area! :)",

    "text": "So I'm pretty much in love with this place for a few reasons. There Mac N' Cheese is probably the best I've had in Singapore, there Chicken Wings pack a mean punch, and there Malt Milkshake is the bomb. Seriously, this place has become my go to American diner and I can't applaud the service, the food, and the all out amazing-ness that is OverEasy enough!",

    "text": "Overeasy serves really good bar grub, and I love the American Diner's design concept that guides every aspect of the experience here. They've got a great outdoor seating area as well, and I generally prefer getting a place out here because, unfortunately, Overeasy's indoor space tends to get as cacophonous as a dim sum restaurant. It gets incredibly loud in here, what with the loud music and patrons straining to have a conversation over it. For your sanity and comfort, I strongly recommend getting a place outside, but it does get crowded very quickly on weekends, so try to head down in the early evening or call ahead for a table.",

All that said, t's nice having the view of the bay and the MBS light show in the evening",

    "text": "I've only eaten here once or twice and spent the rest of my time drinking. This is one of those places where you go because it's there and you need a drink. They have a good enough booze selection and the service is competent enough to get totally forgettable while still delivering your drinks in a reasonably timely manner.The highlights are the double-whammy view of Marina Bay on one side and hilariously drunk punters streaming out of Butter Factory on the other - depending on which time of the evening you go, of course. Oh and they have Oban 14, my favourite single malt. Huzzah!",
