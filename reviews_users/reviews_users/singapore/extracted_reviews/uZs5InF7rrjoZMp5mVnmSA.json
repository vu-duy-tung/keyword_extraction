We ordered the fresh frog porridge, chili frog leg and ginger spring onion frog leg. Everything is served in a hot stone pot and it was an extremely hot day but it was worth it. This place opens at 12PM and closes at 3:45AM. The fresh coconut water served in a coconut was extremely refreshing. People may be deterred from eating frog but it tastes like chicken but the texture is more similar to dark meat.",

    "text": "The frog here's cooked JUST enough that it maintains more the texture of a firm-fleshed whitefish than of a chicken - which is great! It's snappy and tastes very fresh, despite the fact that they don't have the frogs lined up in tanks outside like the other establishments in the area. I have mixed feelings about this - I do feel like we should confront the fact that our porridge requires murder, so the uncomfortableness I feel when I see the frogs in the tank is a plus for me.I got my frog - just one - 'dry chili' style, which is still pretty wet-sauced. This is nice because the sauce bleeds into the porridge and gives it some flavor.",

It's famous for its frog leg porridge, so popular that it's now a chain in Malaysia, China, Taiwan, and Indonesia.We were actually looking for a small snack, so we ordered a small claypot ginger spring onion frog instead of porridge. It was very flavorful, albiet a bit salty without rice. The pieces of frog were quite decently sized, and very springy and fresh. It's definitely not that dirt cheap street food though, and ran ~S$9 for a small claypot with about 4-5 large pieces. The guy taking our order was a bit strange, constantly trying to upsell us to get a large even though we insisted that we already ate dinner and were just having a quick snack...It wasn't really a quick snack though, because of course they cook everything fresh to order, so we were anxiously waiting for about 15-20 minutes while everyone else around us seemed to be getting served their food! Next time gotta try the actual porridge...",

Boy were we wrong. The quintessential local experience of eating out on the sidewalk a few blocks down from where happy endings are made and the rolling of the dice on a picnic table. I guess gotta everyone gets famished after having some fun. Ok on to the main reason. We sat down on the picnic tables and the plastic seats and ordered our meal. First came the oyster omellete, it was interesting, scrambled egg paired with oysters. Then came \u00a0the porridge and As you ladled the frog \u00a0the saucy goodness just hugged the delicate meat that was prepared fresh. \u00a0 There were quite a few of them tucked away in the clay pot, enough to feed the 3 of us. Then came the deep fried legs, the spicy sauce the accompanied the dish was a little spicy for me. Spice is the life there. I had to tamper down the heat and ordered a fresh coconut. Boy did that help. Don't be scared go and try it.",

Lor 9 specializes in two flavors, dry chili and ginger spring onion. The latter was definitely on the sweeter side, with a gooey caramelized glaze. Out of the two, I enjoyed the dry chili more--the gooey caramel sauce was an overkill. The consistency of the plain porridge hits the target. It's not too watery, overcooked, but nice and thick! Similar to the frog, it comes in a piping hot clay pot! Plain porridge is an additional cost at $2. Tip: Order some beef hor fun across the street. They'll bring the dish across the street to where you are sitting. Geylang Lor 9 Fresh Frog Leg Porridge will not do the same.",
