    "text": "If you are thinking of pampering yourself this Valentine's day, Caffe B might be the place for you. This Japanese-Italian restaurant sits a distance away from most celebrity chef restaurants , providing a quiet ambience though one might take some time to be used to the dimly lit brown .The set meal of five courses is based on the Groupon voucher and not all items are available on the ala carte menu. The following is an excerpt of that day.We loved the very nourishingly sweet Japanese pumpkin soup with tomato, with the nutty aroma from the roasted walnuts topped with a piece of fried basilFor the main, I believed our choice of the Argentinian Beef Tenderloin with Marsala (red wine) Reduction was a right one out of the three choices including salmon and risotto. The purple and white pom douchesse are the two spiral shaped things if you can spot them in the picture. They are seasoned mashed potato mixed with egg, squeezed out from a piping bag then baked till golden.Just look at how pink the meat is and you can imagine the tender of the beef was. The meat sat on top of spinach puree next to a sauteed radicchio trevigano, a vegetable which resembled purple cabbage to me. Squid Ink Uni Pasta is a signature ala carte dish which truly stood out from the usual squid ink dishes as the tangy tomato cream balanced the unique smell of the Uni which some people might be afraid of. The Japanese eggplant was sliced into rounds was plain on its own naturally but a perfect match when eaten with the pasta.Service was courteous while not too friendly since a distance is kept to give some personal space to diners especially since most customers that night were couples. Anyway, there is still something that grapples me. In Japan, I've heard of B-class restaurants, whose names are relative to A-class Michelin restaurants but it does not mean that the food is not good. It just implies that such places are more down-to-earth eateries, serving delicious cuisine with inexpensive prices. Could that be why Caffe B is called Caffe B ? :)",

The main course was tomato risotto, which only looked like a bottom of the pot congee with very poor presentation. \u00a0(Please see the pic). Wagyu strip loin was cut horribly and despite requesting 'rare' it came out as 'medium'. \u00a0 For the dessert, it was a strange combination of red bean, berry and cream which none of us had more than half a bite. \u00a0The service was awful with very snide hostess. \u00a0Wine we ordered was forgotten, even though only two tables were occupied, one being us. \u00a0Rushing us to clear the table at 1:30pm at the end. \u00a0Glassware was from Ikea and decor was just horrendous with mix of Italian rustic, modern and Japanese. \u00a0It could be soooooooo much better but clearly nobody from the management cares. \u00a0Sad.",

    "text": "After failing to get a a table at Mozza, we swung by Caffe B, as we were still in the mood for Italian, and we were very glad that we did! \u00a0Billing itself as Japanese Italian, the Japanese influences were subtle, with perhaps the strongest being in the beautiful presentation of the dishes. \u00a0We stopped by during lunch, and one of the best values is the $25 3 course lunch set, which included a beautiful chicken and mizuna salad, a choice of entree and a rice pudding. \u00a0On our visit, we could choose from wagyu rump, pan seared sea bass or risotto. \u00a0We tried both the wagyu and sea bass, and both were excellent. \u00a0We also tried the pappardelle with a rich meat ragu and a lighter spahghetti pomodoro which my daughter loved. \u00a0Our table also shared a lovely pizza with sausage, broccolini, and mozzarella cheese which was also very good. \u00a0Overall, I found the food quality excellent - and in most cases while Mozza and Pizzeria Mozza might be a hair better, Caffe B is a much better value. \u00a0The pizza was definitely one of the best I have had in Singapore, and both pastas were excellent with a good sized portion. \u00a0The ambiance is also quite nice - quiet and elegant with excellent service throughout. \u00a0Definitely a great value, and a nice find among the dining options at MBS!",

    "text": "Caff\u00e9 B is an Italian fine dining restaurant and bar that offers diners the best of Italian tradition, style and cuisine - topped with an exceptional dedication to service. The restaurant is also spread across two floors with a 30-seater bar along the Marina Bay Sand Waterfront Dining promenade.For the first-timers who are new to bar culture, Caff\u00e9 B recommends that you start off by finding out your preferred base for alcohol drinks before working your way around and they hope that you'll eventually end up loving the forgotten classics which are the purest way to enjoy the spirits.My friend picked a Dirty Martini to taste, of which I took a sip. Dirty Martinis have a saltiness picked from the olives soaked in the drink while delivery in crisp, sharp taste from the alcohol. Interesting to finally taste a classic often pictured in vintage ads and movies.The sweet-toothed in me was enticed by their selection of Ice Cream cocktails of which I picked the Straight Flush - Vodka, lychee liqueur, fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream sounded like my kind of thing. True enough, it was very much a fun drink because it was so palatable.",

    "text": "The \"fine\" in this fine dining outlet is the same as in fine print, so don't expect big portions. Food wise, its pretty generic tastiing which really doesn't deserve the price. The few nice dishes are probably the lamb, which was surprisingly good and encrusted with mystery delicious stuff, and the lobster pasta thing. If you want good, decent food, head to db bistro instead. The service staff is pretty nice though, i think that having to deal with my sister is a bit of a trial by fire for service staff, and they did pretty well i think.",

    "text": "Had heard friends rave about Caff\u00e9 B so decided to check it out for one of my birthday dinners. Always a big fan of modern fusion cuisine, so was quite looking forward to the experience.Food : K and I went for the wagyu beef carpaccio which was good but not amazing. H went for the foie gras degustion, essentially foie gras done three different ways; a foie gras lollipop sprinkled liberally with walnuts much resembling that of a Magnum ice cream, pan fried foie gras in filo pastry and a foie gras mousse tartlet. Interesting presentation but H commented it was again, not amazing. For the mains I went for the Boston lobster with yuzu citrus butter sauce ... commendable but nothing to shout about. K had the lamb rack while H had the Kurobuta black pork loin. Both agreed it was not bad, but nothing to write home about. What we really liked though were the desserts; I went for the lemon sorbet with vodka and prosecco, which left me feeling really high and happy! The boys had the hazelnut tart which they loved as well.Ambience : Not bad ... a lot of mirrors and chandeliersService : Decent",

    "text": "If you somehow enjoy fusion food - Japanese and Italian in this instance, then you'd probably enjoy Caffe B. Helmed by a Japanese chef, the offerings are relatively well-done, considering the fusion doesn't always bode well. My favourite so far has to be the live boston lobster linguine which was done perfectly al dente and was so flavourful that I left nothing on the plate. Service is very prompt and efficient, no doubt thanks to the ever watchful maitre'd and prices aren't really sky high. With the choice of an al fresco, indoor or a bay front bar seating, Caffe B is the perfect place to have a romantic dinner, or a nice family gathering.",
