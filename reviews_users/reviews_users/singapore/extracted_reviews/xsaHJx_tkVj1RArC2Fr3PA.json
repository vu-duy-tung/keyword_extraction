For foreigners and visitors alike, this laksa stall is the perfect example of a local no frills hawker if you want to experience the authentic experience.The laksa itself is well balanced, and isn't overly rich like many others I've tasted. The noodles are cooked well, and the slices of fish cakes and herbs that top off the dish is just perfect. Note that this does come with fresh, raw, cockles. As I once heard something about cockles carrying hepatitis...I pick those out. All in all, this is a great deal for only SGD$3!",

Maybe I should took a taxi but my google map app told me that it was like 15 minute walk from my hotel.But it was all worth it when she ate that whole bowl all by herself! It was empty and she even drank all the soup when I went and get us a barley drink!I ended up getting one for myself! It only cost $2! The soup base has so much depth: spicy, sweet, salty and creamy! I love the cockies! I love the noodle! I love how I can eat the whole thing with a spoon.Worth getting there early to beat the rush as it was not busy at all when I was there. I can have a few more rounds if I wanted!Maybe I should have a few more bowls! Extra Spicy please!",

This stall is one of many on the floor, with plastic chairs and tables in the eating area, and can be easily spotted by the queue that's formed in front of it. I decided to check it out as I love laksa and was intrigued by the good Yelp reviews.After queuing for what seemed like ages, I got a small bowl with steaming laksa, and from what I could make out, lots of cockles. The broth was not overly spicy, and not thick and rich enough for my taste, but good, and the noodles were ok - pre-cut to provide for easier eating. All for 2 Singapore dollars (ca 1,3 EUR).Drinks are ordered from the ladies circling the tables, and paid directly with them. The atmosphere is really very authentic- I was the only caucasian eating there today, and it's a nice refuge from the rain in monsoon season - I escaped a total downpour walking into the stall area :-)If you're really hungry one bowl won't suffice though, but you'll be spoiled for choice as to what to eat next from the other stalls. I have had better laksa but for the price and the atmosphere I was glad to have tried it out, and you should, too.",

The soup is cooked on a charcoal stove and continually stirred. The cook looked very serious going at her craft so it raised my expectations.Not too creamy, it doesn't make you feel sick by the end of the meal. And the portion is really kinda small so you should have two bowls. I made the mistake of ordering just one then I saw the couple next to me get three to share between them two. Argh, the line...

The only cons that I can think of is the long queue. This place has no airconditioning and the queue is long. However, watching \"uncle\" make the broth on the charcoal fire in a bronze soup pan is quite entertaining. His facial expressions look very calm and zen, even in this kind of hot weather. The way how he stirs the broth is like exercising Tai chi. \u00a0It's definitely worth waiting for it.I highly recommend my Yelpers to have Sungei road Laksa.",

The illustrious heritage hawker still uses charcoal to fire up his stove, and if you ever thought it was no biggie to use charcoal fire, Sungei Road Laksa will change your mind; it's immediately evident that the smoky char of the fire imbues each bowl of laksa with an irresistibly heady aroma.The queues may be legendary but clockwork-efficient production of the noodles ensures the line moves fast. But if you're really averse to waiting in line, the best time to hit up Sungei Road Laksa is after the peak lunch hours on weekdays. There's hardly a queue then. The standard order Laksa ($3) is loaded with beansprouts, fishcake and cockles. The cockles, though petite, are swimmingly fresh and succulent, and lend a briny accent to the rich and robust gravy. If you can take the heat, ask for extra helpings of the sambal chilli to stir into the gravy, it adds a potent punch and complements the laksa base.",

Almost don't have to chew...Ordering system is a bit quirky. You tell them how many bowls you want, when there are still customers in front of you, so they can start preparing them. Its quite interesting to watch them work. It seems like they have the process down to a science. The number of scoops of soup in and out of bowls, etc. And they work with a charcoal stove. No chopsticks, only spoons, but they cut the noodles into spoon size portions for ultimate speedy consumption. I would recommend trying.",

Katong laksa being a signature Singaporean dish.It's also unique in its own right that you do not eat it with fork or chopsticks, but only with a spoon. I guess that's where half the flavor comes from (the broth).It's tasty and cheap ($3 !) for that it gets 5 stars alone. Not to mention it's cooked on a charcoal fired stove which adds to the flavor.This particular place is a family business and very recently got passed down to the next generation, so I'm very happy that we can still enjoy the cheap and tasty goodness that this place has to offer.The best time to come is around opening time (9-10am) or late lunchtime (around 3pm), otherwise expect a long queue. Personally the morning is the best as the food is the freshest.",

    "text": "Laksa is a must try dish while visiting Singapore, and Sungei Road Laksa is your MUST GO place to get laksa in Singapore. Yelpers gave another great suggestion and this place definitely did not disappoint. The place is located in a more residential part of town. I actually took a taxi here as it wasn't very close to any subways stations. But it was so worth it! Its one of 5 stalls in a smaller hawker center. So order your food, watch them cook it, and take your order to any open table. They only sell one item (not even drinks), but its so good! Their laksa broth is creamy and flavorful, yet still light. You get a choice of spicy or not spicy. The spicy comes with a spoonful of chili sauce. Get it spicy, as it provides a good kick without the burning sensation. I rarely ever finish the soup when I eat noodles as I always feel like restaurant soup noodles use a lot of msg or salt in their soup. However, this was one of those times where I drank all the soup, licked the bowl, and still wanted more! I love the cockles they have in the soup. It has that seafood freshness and sweet taste, which I've never had before. The bowl is really small, but is only $2 SGD. The taxi driver suggested I order 2 bowls since the bowls are small. He was right, and 2 bowls were just perfect! They don't sell drinks. Instead, you'll see a lady come by from another stall taking drink orders. I brought my own bottled water, so I declined. But the lady sells juices and beer. There's also another old lady that comes by to sell you tissue packets, just in case you weren't carrying any on you. (No napkins provided here either.)FYI, they don't give you chopsticks for these noodles, and you don't really need them. The spoon they provide is enough to finish all the noodles and soup!",

I loved the creaminess from the coconut milk paired with all the spices to give this dish a nice kick.",

The Laksa was flavorful, even if the gravy was a bit thin. It was available with cockles, which was disappointing since some places will happily substitute prawns. And they sell only one size, which I would call small. The Kueh Pie Tee was tasty, but with ground peanuts is not traditional Nonya style.Cost:At $3 for a bowl, the Laksa is an excellent value.Service: Good, the queue was quite long, but went quickly. The uncles were quick to clear away the bowls after.Atmosphere:This is a coffee shop (no aircon). Overall:If you're in the area and craving Laksa, it's definitely worth stopping here.",

This seemingly humble bowl of $3 SD laksa is packed with a heavenly blend of sweet, sour, spicy and lots of umami....after one spoonful I already wanted another bowl!I arrived around 11AM and waited only about 10-15 minutes, building up my appetite as my eyes feasted on watching the aunties stirring and ladling big spoonfuls of soup over a charcoal stove. The soup is fills you with umami and fresh cockles and packed with strong flavors of chili and curry, all balanced out by sweet coconut milk which lightens the broth to be perfect. A noodle soup is good when you drink it to the last drop and that's exactly what it did.",

With only one item being served and only one size, ordering was a breeze. When it's your turn, just let them know how many bowls when you're standing in the queue. Watching them prepare a bowl of laksa was fascinating all on its own as they use the broth to blanch your bowl of noodles multiple times. The bowl is then topped off with a scoop of cockles and some homemade fish cake, and definitely ask to get it spicy since they put the chili paste on the side of the bowl. Taking my first sip of the broth made me realize that all the laksa I've had before was by no means on par with Sungei Road. The soup has layers upon layers of flavors starting from the sweetness of the coconut to the saltiness of the shrimp paste, the complex blends that builds the curry, and finally the spiciness from the chili paste.Eating a bowl of noodles without chopsticks is quite hard especially since the noodles are pretty long, don't wear a white shirt by the way! The bowl of laksa is small by comparison but a perfect size if you plan on eating something else afterwards.",

I saw people order two bowls for themselves after they requested for large and was told only one size. It is not a big bowl but it can be filling, especially when you also order a drink. It is without chopsticks (also stated clearly at the stall - I think they got tired of people asking) like the original katong laksa in katong. It comes with just bean sprouts, sliced fish cake slivers and cockles. None of those fancy prawns, taupok or even crayfish in other versions. Mix the chili into the gravy to get the red gravy we are used to seeing. It is not that spicy. Now that I like cockles, this is the place for my fix. It is chockfull of it. The first time I tried it was over 10 years ago before the renovation and I was not that into it. Maybe because it was hot and muggy, plus I did not care for such a small bowl with simple ingredients then.",

Considering bowls of laksa that we had eaten before, nowadays, how many of them still have the gravy cook over charcoal fire?There are a few stalls named Sungei Road Laksa, apparently they are not affiliated with this stall as they have openly declared on their signage that there are no other branches. Sungei Road Laksa is a family business and you can the family members each having their dedicated tasks. You can observed the flow of their ordering process while you are in the long snaky queue.What makes a perfect bowl of Laksa? I'm not a fan of Laksa with strong \"Lemak\" (Coconut Milk\" gravy and Sungei Road Laksa has a well balance of all flavours in a simple $3 portion bowl. Just like the traditional way of eating, there is no use of chopsticks for the noodles as the long noodles wereLaksa - $3Gravy is not spicy and that is one of the reasons why I started loving it when I was a kid. Ingredients are simple with cockles, slices of fishcakes, laksa leaves and chilli to add some spicy kick to the bowl.I wouldn't say no to this comfort bowl of childhood favourite. \u00a0They are opened daily 9.30am to 5pm but closed on Wednesday. I bet you will feel the same that the queue is worth waiting for!",

Having 7 of them in one bowl was unimaginably decadent.Also, the broth: while it's coconutty, that's not the dominant taste. It's funky and green and very spicy if you choose to mix the whole dollop of chili in. They don't let you use chopsticks, which I don't understand, unless it's to recreate the frustration of trying to get cockles out of their shells; the noodles are too slippery and long to be held by the spoons and you end up slurping them right out of the bowl.
