    "text": "Located at the second, one could not help but stared at the colorful decorated restaurant. The restaurant was beautifully decorated with various traditional cutlery all over the place, that one was afraid to use them for dining. This Mothers' Day weekend the restaurant would be having a special The Peranakan Set Menu of Yesteryears (S$200++ / 4pax) which consisted of the following dishes :Sup Bakwan Kepiting Rich broth of crabmeat/pork/prawn balls with bamboo shoot The meatball was juicy but one could not really taste the crabmeat and prawn in it.or Itek TimTender duck steamed with kiam chye and sour plumsAlthough there was the distinct salted mustard's taste, the soup was not too salty and the duck was quite tender.Nasi UlamA spectacular dish of rice with raw herbs, vegetables, minced fish and salted fish.The dish was served at room temperature, as it was considered a salad kind of dish.The dish was presented in a heart shape, to show the love to mother. Crunchy and savoury that one could not taste the salted fish in it.Sambal Pisang JantungBanana blossoms were used in this dish. To eat this dish, just scoop the mixture with the Bitternut cracker. The spicy, savoury and tangy taste of the mixture, balanced the bitterness of the cracker. It was a party in the mouth.Telur Goreng ChinchalokSavoury homestyle omelette with chinchalok melakaIt was a simple dish, pan fried omelette served with fermented shrimp sauce. But it tasted very appetizing. Babi AsamBraised Pork Cheeks in a Tangy Tamarind SauceThe meat was tender which soaked up the flavours rather well. Although it was asam dish, it was not too sourish.Ayam Buah KeluahA true blue peranakan dish. Stewed with chicken from great grandma's recipe.Buah Keluah is a poisonous fruit which can be made edible by correct methods of cooking. To eat it, one had to use the tiny spoon to scoop out the mashed filling which packed in the nut. It was buttery in taste without any bitterness. The chicken which served with it was quite tender too.Udang Masak NenasThe prawns were cooked in curry with pineapple. The gravy was tangy and slightly spicy. The prawns were fat and juicy.Bittergourd Asam BusokThe dish was a rare find. There was none of the usual bitterness while retaining the distinct bitter gourd's taste and shape. The dish was served with you tiao ( deep fried dough) which one could tear it into pieces to soak up the gravy. Dessert was supposed to be Apom Bokwa Pisang but was not available. Instead we had Kueh Dadar. The skin was thin and soft, while inside was packed with juicy coconut filling.",

    "text": "Flavours that could turn you Baba.Peranakan Food, by far one of my favourite cuisines and one that easily touches not only the heart but the soul. There have been a huge number of new Peranakan restaurants appearing on our shores these few years but we couldn't help but try, The Peranakan Singapore. It takes a lot to claim that you are a good restaurant but it takes even more guts to name your restaurant THE Peranakan. Thankfully, THE Peranakan is VERY GOOD INDEED. I have to admit, The Peranakan isn't by any means cheap. In fact, it falls into one of the pricier Peranakan restaurants in Singapore and with big prices, you expect big flavours and that is something The Peranakan certainly delivered.Itek Tim ($7)I enjoyed this duck and salted vegetable a lot. It wasn't overly salty or overly heavy, yet you could taste that smoothness in the soup that leaves \u00a0delightful, warm, fuzzy feeling with every sip.Nonya Chap Chye ($15)One of the \"Big Five\" in Nonya Cuisine and a must try is the Nonya Chap Chye. The cabbage was cooked perfectly, soft but not disintegrating in your mouth. The beancurd skin added a nice, light flavour to dish, without overpowering the sweetness from the cabbage and the wholesome, earthy flavours of the mushroom and black fungus. A very well balanced Chap Chye that allows the natural flavours of each vegetable to shine. Kaki Babi Pong Teh ($19)Having Babi Pong Teh with Pork Belly is one thing but having that amazingly tasty fermented bean sauce with pork leg is a WHOLE different level. The braised pork leg is wonderfully braised, melting off the bone. The skin and fat perfectly melts in your mouth and because of the slow braise, the sauce is very rich and tasty without feeling overly fatty. Sotong Masak Asam ($17)This is officially the wife's FAVOURITE dish. The squid is perfectly cooked, firm yet tender and soft but what makes this dish special is the sauce. The Assam is not spicy, the light wonderful sourness of the tamarind, elevated with that salty sweetness of the Belimbing (starfruit) makes this a wonderful dish. \u00a0Who would have thought, Assam and starfruit. Yum!Satay Babi Sum Chan ($19)Now this was something different. This isn't the BBQ meat skewers with peanut sauce that we're used to. The pork belly is braised in a wonderfully salty, sweet peanut sauce. Perfectly cooked, the pork belly melts in your mouth and leaves behind a rich, sweet earthy flavour. A little on the oily side from the pork belly, this dish is NOT for the health conscious. Ayam Buah Keluak ($19)The true blue Peranakan dish. The chicken thighs were nicely cooked, remaining tender and moist and the Buah Keluaks were heavenly! Each seed's meat is delicately removed , blended till it's slightly smoother and re-stuffed into the shells. Because it's blended, the \"meat\" of 2 seeds are squeezed into one seed, making each seed packed with black goodness. But the star of the show has to be the sauce. The rempah (spice paste) was blended well with the ratio of spices used perfect, ensuring a very fragrant, very smooth sauce without any of the ingredients overpowering the other. Definitely THE best Ayam Buah Keluak I've had in Singapore (restaurant wise. The best are still by mom and grand aunt). Durian Pengat ($9) Yes, $9 may sound like A LOT for a bowl of Durian Pengat (smashed or mashed durian) but it is worth every cent. The durian is sweet and pungent without being over powering and the bit of gula melaka (Palm sugar) on top added a nice salty, sweet goodness to elevate the dessert to a different level. There have been a lot of argument as to what is considered a true, blue Peranakan cuisine but to me, because each family's recipe tend to differ and vary, what's most important is that the food touches the soul and The Peranakan's food certainly does that, across many dishes.",

    "text": "The restaurant is very pretty and in a very convenient location (Orchard Road!) which is more than I can say about most Peranakan restaurants. Come here if you have guests - it's very pretty!Unfortunately, the food left me wanting. The dishes were not served very hot, the dishes were alright in flavor but lacked the refined taste that would better match the restaurant's decor, and the prices were high (probably to compensate for the rental).I really liked the hae bee hiam (spicy shrimp rolls) that they served at the beginning of the meal. Sadly, the babi pongteh was flavorful but the meat wasn't tender enough - probably wasn't stewed for long enough. The assam fish head had a yummy sauce but the fish itself was lackluster - slightly fishy, not the best. The Chap Chye was fairly bland which was pretty upsetting. The Nasi Ulam Istimewa was something I was looking forward to since it's hard to find anywhere else, but it somehow just didn't come together right. Perhaps the herb mixture wasn't in the right proportions, or perhaps things weren't sliced up evenly enough to give a good texture... Whatever it was, it didn't quite taste right.I'll probably go back to Joo Chiat for my Peranakan fix. But if I were to bring guests somewhere, this would be a much nicer location to do that.",

    "text": "We were recommended this new peranakan place located in claymore connect just off orchard road. Got to the restaurant - what a lovely looking restaurant ! There were lovely peranakan motif combined with some modern classic furniture. Loved the ambiance n were greeted with very friendly staff members. The menu is a selection of many different types of peranakan favourites. There is also the Tok panjang feast which should be preordered and contains most of the favourites. It is said to come with a certificate if you select this option ! There is also the six course degustation menu as well as the chef table option for those inclined. We selected a wide selection of food and were treated to some excellent authentic food. Started with the kueh pie ti set which got you to get your hands dirty and assemble it yourself. The shrimp ngoh hiang was pretty well done - it was a good serving of large rolls with some very good sauce.We then had rice with a selection of dishes - the nyonya chap chye, ayam (chicken) buah keluak, kaki babi (pork trotters) pong teh, asam pedas fish head and some nasi ulam. Notable highlights were the kaki babi pong teh and the chicken. We thought that meat was well cooked but the sauces were spot on. We also had the dessert chefs platter which were a selection of cakes, sweets and cake. The Pulut Enti durian delighted the durian lovers. All in all we had a great time - good food, excellent service. Will definitely come back",
