    "text": "Defiantly a 4.5 Star if that was possible.This place has a variety of dishes. And the Thai side of the menu is very good. The service is fast, even on busy times and the bar is well stocked. Have ordered Hot Basil chicken twice and got the happy burn on my tongue. The Pad Thai noodles were sweet and spicy. I also tried the Chicken Tikka and the taste was good.I like the closeness of the Resturant to my hotel and the outdoor seating is enjoyable. The price for the meal is very reasonable. The Noise level can get moderate at night with the drinking.For the variety of foods and drinks I'd recommend this place for parties and fun meals. The cons are the toilet is a single patron toilet and a bit beat up. On my next visits I'll be stopping but for some more enjoyable meals!!",

    "text": "One of the better places along the water at Robertson Quay. In general I am a bit skeptic about places that do a lot of different food and here they serve Thai, Western and Indian food. I have not sampled the Western food but I have been pretty happy with both the Indian and the Thai food. Neither is any OMG-experiences but both are well above average and at very decent prices.I like the relaxed atmosphere here and they have always been very friendly and service-minded so it has been pleasant to visit here. The good food is complemented by a beer selection of craft beers that is perhaps not amazing but also well-above what many places have. The fact that they also do not automatically add a service charge is another plus in my book.What is however not a nice experience is the men's room. It has been verging from dirty to disgusting on all occasions I have been here and that is just not ok and I always make me wonder how spaces in the restaurant guests are not seeing look.",

    "text": "This appealing joint is very conveniently located on the prettiest part of Robertson Quay, facing the river, and very close to Robertson Bridge.On first impression, it is like a privately-owned, hipstered-up mini hawker centre with a bar and three stall-like kitchens. It is conceptualised as a coffee-shop, where customers won't pay neither the dreaded service charge nor tax. Instead, customers are encouraged to get a \"proper\" drink at the bar, since drink sales are what pays for the service crew. That explains the 15-dollar pints.Nothing can go wrong when you have three kitchens with very different kinds of food, and this is a good example. The three kinds of food being served are Thai, North Indian and Western. So far I've tried the Thai and North Indian, which is my favourite (since I'm such a sucker for Indian food). The good thing about this kind of variety is that different cravings can be satisfied on a single visit.The food is good and prices are quite affordable. Drinks are a bit overpriced but, as explained above, it's for a good reason. The staff members are friendly and attentive, though at times they seem overwhelmed. Overall, it's a very good place to have a relaxed meal by the river with friends while watching people and enjoying variety. Above all, Bar Bar Black Sheep is a good statement that diversity is strength.",

We tried entrees from each food stand, all were sub par with tiny portion sizes. We ordered drinks, they brought my boyfriends beer right away, I had to ask for my wine not once, but twice after ordering. Solid eh.",

    "text": "This is a great place to go to with a big group of people as they have three kitchens, Thai, Western and Indian. You can order a selection off all three if you wish to; however, this review is for their Indian kitchen. We actually had this place recommended to us by our property agent as we live a couple of doors down. She recommended the Indian food so off we headed the next time we had a curry craving. We really enjoyed the curry although we found the outside seating uncomfortable as there are no cooling fans that work. Since this experience, we always get a take away. My husband is a chicken curry fan although he finds that as thigh meat is used here, they are not quite to his taste, he is a breast man! I'm a fan of mutton curry and have enjoyed each one I have tried so far. I would especially recommend the Makani Dahl, I always order an extra portion to keep in the freezer for a later date.",

If you're up for some good grub during town, head over for their $11 nett lunch set meals. For example tom yum soup as starters and the mains are either cheeseburger, black pepper chick burger and aglio olio.The latest addition is air-conditioned (unlike the outlet at Sixth Avenue), and is a great place to rest amidst Singapore's unforgiving weather.The laidback ambience is an ideal place for an office worker to kick back, relax and just enjoy a pint of the freshest brew.",
