While it is a little weird for so many French restaurants to appear in Little India, Cocotte is probably one of the more outstanding ones in terms of decor and quality of food. Portions are huge so sharing is definitely one option you should consider when you pay it a visit. Price wise, there's been a significant increase since they opened, but overall, when you consider the quality and authenticity of the food and the ambience, it's really quite worthwhile.",

Instead of the usual menu, it would be offering \u00a0Southern American BBQ with an Indian flair cuisine. Besides its ala carte menu, it also offered 3 course lunch set priced at S$25++ and S$35++, which included a choice of appetizer : Na'an & Bombay Butter (ala carte S$4++), It looked quite oily but it was quite nice, although I would prefer it to be more crispy.Onion Bajji & Smoked Yoghurt (ala carte S$6++), Looked quite dark but it was quite crispy and light with the yoghurt sauce.Crab & Saffron Biryani (ala carte S$24), The rice pops were lack of crispiness and felt a tab flat (lau hong). It looked more like crab stick salad topped with rice pops.a choice of main : For Lunch Set A (S$25++): MS Cheeseburger (ala carte $20++),Tomato chutney, Indian pickles, American cheese on a Brioche BunLamb Vindaloo (ala carte S$38++/ 2pax)(Smoked Lamb Shoulder, Chickpeas, Chopped Salad, Raita & Chapati),The serving was huge. The lamb was thinly silced and there was no gamey taste. I like that it was served with refreshing yoghurt salad.Kingfish Collar, Coconut Sambal & Eggplant (ala carte S18++)For Lunch Set B (S$35++):Kingfish Collar, Coconut Sambal & Eggplant (ala carte S18++), Tandoori Chicken & CauliflowerPilaf (ala carteS$24++),Pork Ribs (Dry Spice or Madras) (ala carte S$26++),The ribs was chunky, encased with a thick layer of paste. Tender and easy to slice through. Not too spicy but flavourful.Beef Rendang (ala carte S$25++),Beef Rib, Carrot & Fenugreek (Additional $20++) (ala carte S$85++/ 2pax)Served with Pumpkin & Kale Salad (ala carte S$8++)The salad was packed with the sweetness of soft pumpkin and dried raisins. But it was a tab too much when the lamb vindaloo already served with a side of greens, which made this felt like a repeated dish.Accompanied the meal with Free Flow Masala Chai Tea (S$5++) which was available in both hot and iced. Felt that the taste of the tea was a tab too weak.Between 2 females, the food was a tab too much and we could not finish up.",

    "text": "Cocotte is a communal restaurant and bar that serves delicious, genuine country cuisine in a hip environment. They are located in Singapore's Little India just inside Wanderlust hotel.Environment was indeed different and unique on its on with industrial like bar counter and some old school items around.As appetizers, 2 types of olives was given, in dark brown and olives color. Taste were not too greasy and was not too bitter either.Basket of bread was warm and the butter spread given to us was remarkably delicious. Butter was flavourful and was made in France, pairing along well with the warm bread.A special style of serving braised pork trotters in wraps with hazelnuts, thyme, brown butter, capers and sauteed kale. Braised Pork Trotters were deboned and served in shredded form like pull pork and mustard was given to pair along with the dish. Though the dish may be special with nuts and vegetables, i still prefer a stronger taste from braised pork and juicier touch.Pork Trotters Parcel - $18The whole grilled seabass was something not within my expectation as it was bigger than what I had thought. Meat was fresh and tender, served with vierge and salad of crispy quinoa that literally overwhelmed the entire perimeter of the fish. Capers, mint, radish, shallots, lemon and parsley was part of the mix too.Whole Grilled Seabass - $48They use grass fed beef which is antibiotic and hormones free from Cape Grim, Australia served with green pepper corns sauce, duck fat fries and salad. Ordering Medium Done-ness from the beef, I find that the beef was actually well cook to our request and I would give a thumb up to this dish. Simply love the pairing of tender beef and sauce even though I'm not much fan of medium done-ness. Fries on the other side maybe on a soft but have unique taste.Steak Frites 200G Chargrilled Onglet Steak - $36Apart from the proteins and carbohydate we had from the main dish, here comes the fibre that save us from the \"heavy\" meal. Interestingly mixed with different types of vegetables with a touch of vinaigrette, ah, its really something wonderful to have for the meal.Dinner was pleasant with a comfortable ambiance. The environment is both suitable for gathering or even couple dating. Recommended.",

The above was what happened to me and my partner. We ordered medium rare which we understand the dish won't be sizzlingly hot, but it felt like the plate has been sitting for half an hour before served. We had to ask for reheat, which was really a let-down to the whole dining experience. On the other hand, the service was top-notch on a Saturday night.",

    "text": "Unique and different place near little india in the Wanderlust hotel. Had the brunch and gotta admit it was pretty great. Very different from your typical brunch and because it was a buffet you could order and order the things you loved. A lot of the food was a hit or a miss but majority were pretty delicious. Mussels, chicken pie, etc. The drinks are a little pricey in my opinion. $6 for a not too big glass of lemonade. Did not really think the mains were worth the wait, nor price of the brunch as I think they really could have done better there. The time we had to wait for food was pretty bad. We had looooong moments of awkward silence and just pure waiting for food to come to us. The desserts were pretty bad in our opinion. Did not enjoy any one of them offered for the brunch buffet which was disappointing. They were either too sweet or not sweet at all. They were either too soggy or just had a poor texture. My guess is that they tried to hard here and should quite simply stick to the classics. The coffee was also overly bitter for us and we try not to be too snobbish about it but if I have to add 2-3 packets of sugar for it to be drinkable there's something wrong there. Prices worked up to about $100 each for the brunch & each of us had 2 more drinks. So not entirely cheap for what was offered. But overall the place was really great and fun and we enjoyed their different concept buffet-brunch.",

A friend recommended here for breakfast, however it's a pricey breakfasts for non residents of the Wanderlust hotel ($29.99) although you have a continental buffet and hot cooked meal to dig into. The Silent Reviewer enjoyed his scrambled eggs. but I found the ricotta with seasonal vegetables heavy on the ricotta and light on vegetables (radish and olives), although, I had to admit, the kind of breakfast that doesn't sit like a rock hard lump in your stomach, and therefore I approve (but seriously, about half of the ricotta would do). Continental breakfast offered bog standard mini bakeries (croissants etc), fresh fruit juice, and premade tea and coffee. Was it a pleasant breakfast? Yes. Was it worth the price? I don't think so, not for me. I would note though, the bakery counter looked ah-mazing.",

I'm a frequent visitor of Spicy Thai (that restaurant in the dirty alley) and had drinks here numerous times...but there's a restaurant here? Well, slap my ass and call me Sally! The food here is superb. Yes, the Poulet Roti is a must have, but I think the sea bass is as well! The sea bass arrived on a bed of perfectly grilled vegetables. Not just one or two, but a bed of them! A salad some might say, especially for \u00a0French restaurant where vegetables are typically considered to be garnish. We also ordered the Charcuterie Board to share, and props to the foie gras and terrine! I'm not French foodie, but I am when it comes to Vietnamese so I definitely know what I'm talking about here. Be warned though, the bread for this appetizer is limited and extra pieces range from $4-6 a piece. I'm not sure why Li T. wasn't able to try the Poulet Roti, but it is indeed available for lunch. We did call ahead of time so we didn't have to wait too long for it to arrive. The chef sliced the whole chicken right before serving so it was hot and juicy. I'm not a big fan of chicken (I'm a fish and steak kind of gal), but this chicken was worth the journey to Little India. Organic, hormone free, and free-ranged makes all the difference. Lastly, because of Kathryn B.'s recommendation, I had to try the chocolate tart! Her sentiments hold true; seriously, the best chocolate tart I've had in my life! It was thick and unsweetened--perfect for a dark chocolate lover like myself.",

    "text": "Cocotte is known for their French Country communal dining concept. I've heard many things about their signature chicken rotisserie ($60) but a chicken simply doesn't cut it for brunch for me. Eggs, bacon and sausages over anything any time. Well, apparently i think different from the rest of the diners who were there.My Iced latte wasn't fantastic but well it's not a coffee joint so i've already lowered my expectations. The Homemade iced tea was so so as well.I wanted to have the Croque Monsieur after reading about it on Daniel's blog but they have removed that item from brunch! :(My only other option was to go for the Big Plate ($24) because it has eggs and the full works. As i was sitting there, watching the cooks work in the kitchen while waiting for breakfast to be served, i kept wondering why i didn't see crepes on the menu though i could see them making it. The mystery was solved when my platter was served. My pre-coffee eyesight missed the creamy mushroom and cheese crepe that was stated on the dish description! Anyhoo, really creamy and slightly garlicky mushroom sauce with fluffy layered crepe. Very delicious and very french.For my choice of eggs, I went with the French omelette instead of my usual scrambled. Though it looked really plain and sad looking, the texture was fabulous! A little spongey and airy on the outside but with the runny and creamy scrambled texture inside. If all omelettes were done like this. The platter also included a mini baguette, which i changed for a mini croissant (buttery and flaky just the way i like it); bacon, mesclun salad and a slice of artisanal brie or cantal cheese. You could grab the croissant for breakfast as well, the plain ones go for $1.50 each. They also do chocolate for $1.70 each. I only wish that they were bigger.A first look at the Earl Grey Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($6) left us a little doubtful. The torching wasn't done properly and had left unmelted sugar granules along the edges. However, the dish redeemed itself with the intense flavor of the Earl Grey tea. I derived my caffeine high from this dessert instead of the latte i had. The dense and smooth flavorful custard made my day.If you like a sharp Citron Tart ($5), then Cocotte's would cut it (only by a quarter). What we didn't like was the high sugar content of this one. The main issue was the thin and slightly unbaked crust and the bad custard-to-tart ratio. The texture of the filling was also too gelatinous.Next time if you decide to head to Cocotte, don't give their brunch a miss.",

Not bad. It was cold, like the food had been sitting around before being served. The flavours were decent, and nothing special.I ordered a lamb rack, and my freind ordered \u00a0fish fillet with quinoa.Both dishes took a further 15 minutes to arrive, after which we were both starving.The lamb was well cooked. It was mostly, fat, and felt a bit too lardy, and not that filling....especially, after I worked out before lunch. The tempurature, again was warm, but not hot, as it should have been, as it must have been cooking for about 20 minutes.The taste, otherwise, was indulgent, and really nice with the bean mash and swiss chard. It would have been a lot better with more of the mash and chard.The service, I felt was dimwitted, and slow.We were seated on the corner of the restaurant, and felt largely forgotten. It felt like the servers, when speaking to them, needed to be told SOP's how to do their job.And the food was damn expensive, for the amount, and quality.Overall, a never-return verdict.",

The decidedly limited array kept the quality of the brunch high, and because everything was in petite portions, we really could partake of everything. Also, the long gaps between the trolleys helped encourage the slow food movement thing that the French are so famous for; we actually took the time to graze over a languid brunch.Favourites are:1) Croque Monsieur, a fantastic crusty baguette slathered with an excellent fruit jam, gruyere, mustard, and meaty ham. I got seconds of this.2) Salmon Quiche: exceptional, with a meltingly buttery crust, beautiful caramelization, and a lusciously cheesy filling.3) Homemade Baked Beans with smokey French bacon topped with a sous vide egg, and a drizzle of citrus oil: Exquisite stuff.4) Poulet Roti - a whole organic chicken seasoned with herbed butter and roasted to juicy perfection, then sprinkled with golden almond flakes, and herbed cous cous5) Blue Mussels & Clams simply steamed with white wine, Swiss chard, and fennel cream: fresh and sweet; we drank this like a soup6) Roast Pork Collar blanketed in a glorious mustard cream sided by buttered local vegetables7) Desserts like Creme Brulee and Crepe SuzetteNot so much:1) Seafood Croquette and Salmon Mousse: wasn't my thing2) Squid was a moreish contrast, chewy rings topped off a crusty buttered bread.3) Flatiron Steak, torched with a gorgeous char: a perfect, consistent shade of pink but they laced this with Chimichurri",

The walls were a grey slate made the perfect canvas for the furnishing which was impossibly colourful - in an entirely good way.I had the Rosette as a starter. It is basically French cured pork sausages arranged (naturally) in the shape of a rose. This one is meant for the one with a salty palate and tasted pretty much like a salami would.My main was the Ratatouille Tarte Au Jour. This was delightful one with the stewed vegetable dish served in a buttery tart tray, topped with the powdery taste of cheese. For the main, my friend picked the Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass. Sea bass is a plump, juicy meat that is pretty easy to work with. Cocotte does theirs served with roast fennel, tomato provencal & zucchini gratin. I loved the zucchini gratin, my friend not so much. It was a nice twist.Desserts rolled in with the basque cake. It had chocolate filling and was topped with sugar grains, pretty much a safe, sweet option. I can imagine these are the sweet treats French moms will happily dish out to their children on special occasions and be heroines for the day. I had the creme brulee which I'm sure everyone knows about. This is another safe easy dessert. The smooth, creaminess of the custard coupled with a thin caramel crust - come on, who doesn't like that?",

But interesting. It definitely got my attention!I really liked the quirky interior and mismatched chairs. There was a large \"chandelier\" made of many lamps right int he middle of the room, with lots of old cupboards along the walls. I especially loved all the fresh chrysanthemums in vases and old school metal watering cans all over the place. It made everything seem more cheerful and relaxed.So since we were there for the weekend brunch, I ordered the Smoky Bacon, Egg & Gruyere Cheese Crepe. it cost a whopping $20 for something so simple! It literally was a fried sunny side up in a crepe with 2 sad little strips of crispy bacon on the side. To say I was disappointed would be a major understatement.The other dish that we ordered was the Foie Gras Egg Cocotte, and that would set you back by $24. This dish was really tasty, with fois gras chunks in it, but it was extremely rich and I started feeling a bit sick after a few spoons. The coffee here was mediocre, which ruined it even more for me. In the end, I left feeling rather cheated, since I'd heard so many good things about it. Brunch here is definitely not worth it!",

While the vibe is extremely drifty & chilled out, one can not help but notice how much in contrast this chique eatery is to the neighbourhood it is in. While the food is certainly on the pricey side, their pork collar & mussels were amazing and so was their Walnut Caramel pastry.This is the kind of place meant for long conversations, drawn out lunches and the good wisdom to not overspend even if everything on the menu looks appetizing.",

    "text": "good rustic french cooking at this lovely restaurant hidden away in little india. I've been here once before, nearly 5 years ago - and it was memorable for both the food and it's decor: it's done up all industrial-like in a boutique hotel, a far-cry from the more raucous atmosphere typical in this neighborhood.this return was painstakingly arranged - it's no easy thing to convince ol'-school parents that there is good fine-dining to be found in the slightly dodgy little india enclave - and I'm pretty darn glad the effort was worth it. the cooking is still expert, the place enduringly gorgeous - a good meal in all.we started off with a basket of warm bread - crusty french loaves with soft innards, which were a fortuitous stomach-lining during the wait for the grilled squid and roasted cauliflower salad of baby spinach. this was tasty, especially that golden-ed cauliflower, even if the spinach portion was slightly paltry - and the anemic cephalopod could have done with a bit more color. this took far too long though: my dad did a game of foosball with the sis before this came.we had time after that to watch a bit of prancercise before the mains - but these were rather worth the wait. the grilled pork chop was moist and porky - it can so easily dry out - a thick slab of pig alongside beautifully wrinkled roast taters and a large keropok-type bit of crackling. great textures, good meat.the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was their signature roast chicken, which was tender and glistening, and came with a fantastically browned skin alongside very well-done accouterments. my only complain is that this was a very petit poulet - don't they let chickens grow up any longer? - much more akin to a spring chicken.the beef bourgignon was very good - a reasonable portion of beef over creamy mash. that sauce was something lovely - beefy and umami and properly thickened, I think this was the best dish that night.the short of the perambulating long, is that the overall experience is lovely - good food in pleasant settings. but to be picky: the prices are rather high (with portions smaller than I remembered, though that's the way things are heading on our tiny island), and while service is attentive, food-to-table times need to be abbreviated. and while very good - the food isn't mindblowingly spectacular.",

I chose to start with the duck confit puff pastry, move on to the saddle of rabbit and end with the chocolate tart. \u00a0While all of this tasted as it should (read modern delicius french cuisine) let me tell you what I should have been eating. \u00a0My husband's terrine was super delicious. \u00a0He and I should have shared the chicken for two that went passed us and looked pretty good. \u00a0And as much as the chocolate tart was better than any I have had, it was too big and the cheese smelled so pungent. \u00a0So there, thats my perfect meal. \u00a0Must go back to have it.",

    "text": "Wunderlusting Over Their Weekend BrunchesThe most enquiries I have received of late are, \"Where are the best brunch places in Singapore?\" Before you even scream 'all-day breakfast' and 'eggs benedict' which is probably the next fashionable thing in this island, how does Foie Gras Egg Cocotte and Croque Monsier sound to you? Cocotte at the Wunderlust Hotel (at Rochor area) has brought a complete new a la carte brunch menu with a French twist available every Saturday and Sunday, 11.30am to 3pm. I felt in love with the place before even starting my meal. The boutique hotel was originally a school built in the 1920s, the outside looking extremely historical and the inside contemporary and comfortable. Cocotte on its ground floor is suitable for communal dining, and with decors that makes me believe that I am a holiday elsewhere.All the egg dishes are delightful choices - from the fluffy Omelette with Sauteed Mushrooms and Truffle Oil ($18.00) to the Brandade Egg Cocotte, a Creamy Homemade Salt Cod Mashed with Potatoes ($25.00). The later begin one of my favourite dishes of the day for being soft, delicate and tantalising. Price a little on the high side for me though.",

    "text": "I first read about Cocotte through a magazine which featured it's Poulet Roti (roasted organic hormone free chicken)$60 for 2 person. However, I had not the chance to try it as it is only available during dinner. Also, the place promotes communal dining so it's good for groups and families to dine there. Having been eyeing it's much more affordable set lunch, I finally had a taste of what Cocotte food is like even though the signature Poulet Roti was unavailable.1st appetizer: Escargots Gougeres with parsley cream,tomato Coulis on gruyere pastry. Had to add another $3 for this but I think it is worth it because I wanted to try escargots when ever it is available on the menu.Though I still prefer the garlic and herbs version of Le Entrec\u00f4te's,this one is not too bad either. Much lighter and less savoury2nd appetizer: Pear, Bleu'D Auvergne Salad This is a much creative salad compared to the usual Caesar salad. With generous chunks of blue cheese and toasted hazelnuts, the salad did not require basalmic vinegar or any dressing. The Roasted Pork CollarThe very hot pot came to us with two other sides and you will go WOW when the lid is opened. Right in our eyes is the huge slabs of pork collar swimming in a deep pool of Creamy Dijon Mustard Sauce.....ooh lala.Let's talk about the portion. This was for 2-3 person but we did not expect the portion to be so much.What was left after taking our first huge serving each, this was what was left after 2 rounds of pork. Ok......Then we went happily to challenge our next serving, the next, and continue digging. Just as we thought we've hit the base as the serving spoon seems to hit a flat hard surface, there was another piece of complete slab of meat in one whole!!!!!But come to think of it, this pot of pork collar is really value for $$$. If you just order this 2-3portion one from the ala carte, it is $98. So set lunch is really worth it.We really wanted to finish this because we do not want to waste food. And in the end, when the waitress's came and cleared the table, she asked if we would like to take away the remaining palm sized piece of meat. It was then that I realized...oh I can actually takeaway...Bon Appetit!",

We had the escargot cocette (mushroom and escargot starter served with bread), beef bourguignon (braised beef) and 300g grass-fed ribeye (the best dish). Service was okay and above average. Overall I felt it was a decent experience, but a bit too pricey.",
