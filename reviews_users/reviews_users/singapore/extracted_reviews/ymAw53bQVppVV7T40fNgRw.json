    "text": "I really can't figure out why most of the reviews are so mediocre. I've been twice now. The first time I sat outside just for drinks and it was really nice.The second time was last Friday. They don't take reservations but the girl on the phone said at 1930 it shouldn't be too bad. Anyway, we got there at 1930 and for 4 of us, the wait was close to an hour. No matter though as there are many cool bars in the area (and we went to the Tippling club to wait which was awesome).When we were finally seated, it was right at the back of the restaurant. While part of the appeal of Lucha Loco is the uptempo vibe, the balance is off in the back corner in that it's almost uncomfortably dark and loud (so you have to strain to read the menus and shout to be heard). In the future I'd probably specify that I want to sit outdoors or near the front and just wait however long it takes.Food wise we got the beef tostadas, chicken quesadillas, pork belly tacos, chips and guac and something else. Yes the portions are somewhat small for the price but really it does feel comparable to other similar restaurants in Singapore. I somehow expected this place to be all show with no substance but was pleasantly surprised. All the food was actually fantastic and the pork belly taco in particular was the standout.Great margaritas and good food - it's definitely worth checking out.random comment - it was weirdly expat dominated to the point where I think we were the only table of locals. Not really a good or bad thing though.",

    "text": "A rather disappointing experience even though the location is great and the interior/ambience was wonderful.Nothing can be more of a turn off than feeling like you've been ripped off. The fish tacos were good, but extremely expensive at over S$10 per taco. Drinks ranged from $15-20+ per drink. Quality was so-so, not great but not terrible. What gives this place a low rating is the \"feeling you've been ripped off\", ie. the waitresses did not inform us that unless the majority of Mexican restaurants, guacamole and salsa are charged at approx $5-7 each time you ask for more guacamole and salsa. You will only get that nice surprise when the bill comes.I believe that if you are charging such premium prices for tacos and food, giving your customers some guac and salsa free of charge sounds normal, even expected.Speaking of guac and salsa, they were both very disappointing. If the owners claim that they are bringing ingredients in from Mexico directly (and hence the higher prices), I would wish that they emulated the more vibrant flavours of the guac and salsa that are served in authentic Mexican establishments.The service- not very attentive, sluggish. Nothing to complain about but certainly not prompt or on the ball when it comes to asking if we wanted anything more. Overall, this is not a recommended place for dining. Just a nice locale for a drink after working hours on your way elsewhere in the Duxton Hill area.",

I can deal with that. But tacos at $10+ a pop? Okay the fish taco was pretty good, and the beef with chorizo was... all right, but I'm not sure if that food translates to how much I'm paying. I'm sure I come across as a bit of a tight-fisted ham, but I kinda thought tacos were meant to be streetfoody things, and though I admit the place does justify a bigger price tag, I'm not sure I find the justification here.I'd say try it once, and make the call to return yourself... if you can't find somewhere else to get decent tacos.",

I appeal to mgmt to re-look.Corn, amazing. \u00a08 dollars, steep for a cob.. Sure. \u00a0But It's really something else.Tacos I found authentic and very tasty, though, others in my group said theirs were a little dry. Quesadillas were fantastic. \u00a0The octopus ceviche, 2 thumbs up.. For the drawbacks..Service, in all honesty... I( know this is a hot place at the moment..) could've been a littler smoother. \u00a0Some of the waitresses were running around in a panic, and weren't that attentive when spoken too. I get they were run off their feet, but maybe put a couple more on during peak periods if that's the case?One of our dishes came out 25mins after the rest. \u00a0We had to follow it up twice.The corn chips I found to be stale.The wooden stools in the outdoor area, were quite uncomfortable. Price... It 'aint' cheap, but its not out off the planet expensive. \u00a0I think the owner and management has put a lot of thought, energy and love into this place, and the prices are in line with where I see his vision.Good luck in Duxton, I'll go back again. \u00a0Thumbs up.",

    "text": "Lucha Loco is the current \"it\" place for bankers to hang out, kind of like how Sabio was \"it\" more than a year ago. You can tell a place is \"it\" if every other conference social is held there or for the casual observer, just look for the sign mid-week that says sorry this section is closed for a private event. So what does that mean per se?For one, the food is likely to be decent with a one or two stand out dishes that go well with drinks. I mean, that's the barometer for a lot of working folk right? You walk into a bar after work with this *gawsh I need a drink & some super unhealthy flash fried junk* look and proceed to order whatevers on tap and at happy hour prices (because you don't want to spend money on what is essentially becoming water after a hard day's work, literal and metaphorical pun intended) and then something to fill the stomach. I'd add that because I have had the chance to eat decent Mexican, I was also looking out for the One. That One Mexican restaurant that I could gamely say to out-of-towners sells decent Mexican food and hence upholds Singapore's culinary capital status. So what happened when I visited? Well for one I didn't pay for any of the food I ate so I've no idea how much it costs. Though I'll hazard it wasn't cheap given how enthusiastic the server was about putting food on my table so that she could bill my hosts (who were also covering just about half the bar). I really really liked the crab toastadas. Real crab meat, crunchy nacho used as the toastadas base. Excellent. I kind of liked the chorizo taco but that was it. The chicken taco wasn't great and the cheese in the mushroom quesadillas were more limp than crisp. In fact little secret guys, Bather's restaurant near my house does a really delicious simple cheese quesadilla and obviously beats this. I will say though that the nachos and salsa were pretty darn fine. As for the drinks, obviously I helped myself to the lime margarita and it was not bad. The corona was well, corona and since it was a Wednesday I decided not to venture into tequila territory. So is this It? Nope. Will this place last? I honestly can't say 100% yes. Portions weren't that generous and given that my work brethren like this place, I can imagine it isn't worth the price. But for what it's worth... if you're not picking up the tab, you'll have a pretty good time.",

While I would not say it's awful, I didn't think it's worth the $8 for it. Crab Tostaditos - it's really nice, also very small a plate of it. It's a starter so I guess I shouldn't be expecting it to be filling. Pork Belly Taco - this is definitely a gourmet version. Think 2 pieces of braised pork belly with some Vege garnish held together by soft taco. Nice but again, small. Chicken Quesadilla - tasty, just wish there's more of it. Pastel de Elote Azul - a crumbly dessert made of corn. Not really sweet and I'm not sure if it's meant to be dry but ours was. So I'm not impressed. I would say that as a hangout place, it's awesome.

The chili spiciness hidden within, ready to explode in your mouth is one exciting taste for me! Two bites after, I don't think it is that spicy anymore! However, bring 'em on and I could chow 'em down in dozens. Alas, it is a bit pricey as four balls of crab toastcadillas comes at S$16. The tacos are good, yet pricey in Singapore. Maybe anyone can suggest a better place for tacos?Margaritas are good here. I would definitely be back as this is a great place for a chill Friday's after work hang out place.",

Didn't taste anything like Mexican food. The beef was sweet and tasted more like an Indian rendition with curry and brown sugar. Wasn't terrible, but was not Mexican. \u00a0With 2 Margaritas and some chips my bill came out to $60 and i was still hungry. The best part was hearing a Singaporean welcome me with \"Hola Senior\" LMFAO!!!",

    "text": "If this place serves the best tacos in Singapore, I'm booking a flight back to Baja.Started with the Ceviche de camarones y pulpo (shrimp and octopus ceviche), then ordered the costillas (ribs) and 2 tacos (carnitas and pescado/fish). Each taco was awfully tiny and the tortilla was rather dry. The batter on the fish wasn't crunchy, and they skimped on the cabbage. There was an interesting-tasting mango topping on the fish, but it definitely wasn't authentic. I've visited countless taquerias in the state of California and I know what I'm talking about. People, a taco is cheap street food. It's normally US$1.99 per fish taco, and at S$11 + tax + tip per taco, I expected killer taste for that killer price.The ceviche was decent, not overly sour and the seafood was fresh. However they also skimped on the tortilla chips. The Costillas (ribs) were generally forgettable, although tender, the sauce was rather odd, tomatoish and tasted like it came out of a can. The only redeeming thing was the Pastel de Elote Azul, a blue corn cake with agave nectar & mezcal cream. The corn cake was warm and crumbly with the contrasting smooth texture of the cream beside it. However, I wasn't sure if this was something authentic. I also saw a huitlacoche (corn fungus) quesadilla in one of the pictures here on yelp, however I didn't see that on the menu. Don't get me wrong, the drinks are good, food ingredients are higher quality, and the atmosphere is hip (if you're into that kind of thing). For some reason, this place is the current \"in\" spot, filled with expats holding their margaritas. Lucha libre decor aside, the sky-high prices really turned me off. Food is okay if you haven't tried authentic mexican food, but not *that* mind-blowing to warrant this kind of pricing. My wallet felt gutted.",

    "text": "UPDATED May 9th due to Lucha Loco's comments.I'm really torn about this place. Is the food good? Yes, the tacos aren't bad but at $11 for one when I'm used to $1 (excuse me, with the exchange rate S$1.25) my heart hurts. Nonetheless, if I'm looking for tacos, this is definitely the place I'm going to be. Drinks were good, creative, and relatively cheap as well at $15-20.I came here with a group of girlfriends for dinner and some drinks. We all enjoyed our meal, but were surprised to see a $400+ bill. Damn, with only 5 people eating and 1 person ordering 1 drink, what the hell did we order??? With closer inspection, we realized that each time the waitress came and asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa there was an additional $5-7 charge. Thank you for NOT telling us. I'm sorry, if you're going to be asking, please do make sure we understand that there will be an additional charge. Most Italian places do not charge extra for their breads so we definitely didn't expect this to be the case at Lucha Loco. I personally paid over $60 for two tacos and two drinks. Oh yea, do not order the guacamole here. It was nasty and there was no salt.",

Great food complimented by an even better listing of drinks in an casual but hip atmosphere makes this a easy choice for dates of friends hang-out. If this is the new trend in SG, we can all be excited because a little competition might help bring the price down at LL, pretty much the only thing preventing us from coming back regularly (i.e. if you're like me and require 3-4 tacos to be full)",

    "text": "As many Yelpers have mentioned, $10+ for a taco is kind of steep. In fact, our server asked us about how the food was, and what we thought about the taco (quality, price, etc). We agreed that it was somewhat expensive, but was pretty good nonetheless!My fish taco ($11) was pretty yummy, somewhat charred (and hence salty), but good fish, and nice topping of chipotle mayo (slightly spicy!) and cucumbers (i think?) etc. Got a little messy with fish juices flowing, but not too disastrous :p My friend got the beef taco ($10) and found it somewhat spicy still (low spice tolerance, oops!)We filled up on corn chips + guacamole/roasted tomato salsa ($12). Yum, since I think it's hard to find guacamole in Singapore. I found the taste of the salsa somewhat curious.. couldn't identify what was in it that gave a certain taste. Anyhow, slightly spicy too, not bad!Would like to be back to try the stuffed pepper sometime.. The place definitely started filling up around 7:30pm! Thankfully we got there around 6:30pm so it wasn't too crowded yet.On a side note, luckily our server told us to check the bill - because we got the wrong bill and it was TWICE the amount we spent.. I'm like, we did NOT order any of these things! Even though another server tried to foist two corn orders and a pork taco on me. I'm like.. we're done eating (and have been, for a while), why are you giving me more food.. O.o Thankfully they got us the right bill in the end.",

    "text": "I had just finished yoga before dinner so I wasn't about to undo all the hard work just yet. I can't believe I am saying this but thankfully the dishes weren't too tasty for me to break my resolve. I started with a humble fish taco. I've read other reviews that marked it as a \"yummy but overpriced\" item. Overall, it was ok. A bit too small for it to be considered a meal. Definitely an appetizer and a stingy one at that. If you enjoy fish tacos, I would recommend Tanuki raw's. They serve 2 tacos at $15 and they taste better than the ones here :) Lucha Loco's tacos were too wet. Too much hot sauce made the tortilla soggy :( and very messy to eat. The rest of the dishes I nibbled on a bit but nothing really impressed me very much. Yet this place was full house on a Wed night mind you! Amazing. I attribute its success to the beautiful ambiance and location. Duxton Hill is earning a reputation for drawing in the yuppie crowd. A place to be seen and to see. A feast for the eyes but sadly not the taste buds! haha... 1. Fish taco (fried) - Ok. I had better. 2. Pork ribs - Ok. A bit too saucy? Tasted like a ribs with too much BBQ sauce. 3. Truffle quesadilla - Ok4. Guacamole - I didn't mind it but my dinner companions said it didn't have much of a flavor which was true. It basically tasted like an avocado dip. Very little taste of lime, salt or anything else. That being said, I do like my avocados. The dip was moist and fresh. 5. Salsa - HORRIBLE!!! I can't really describe it. It tasted like cheap tomato ketchup. Everyone on the table barely touched it. 6. Blue Corn Cake with agave nectar and mescal cream - PASS! The cake was so dry even the mescal cream could not make it go down any easier. The mescal cream with berries however were a lovely combination. Then again, who doesn't love berries and cream???7. Sangria - Good. Very light and mild. Not much alcohol but I didn't mind it. I wished I tried their Elotes - Mexican street style grilled corn. It looks peppered with interesting seasonings. Maybe one day when I am around the neighborhood and craving corn I'll pop by for a taste. Otherwise, there isn't much else (food wise) that will compel me to go back.",

    "text": "Lucha Loco, a place that sells gourmet mexican street food, has been receiving rave reviews since it opened last year and we were glad that our experience with the food there turned out to be an amazing and memorable one.I did not regret ordering the Elotes($8) despite knowing that it was just a corn. No, I should correct myself and say that it was an extraordinary grilled corn smeared with chilli, mayonaise and cotija cheese that burst out sweet juices in each bite. I never knew a corn could have such a great allure.Since tacos are the first thing that comes to mind for Mexican cuisine, we instinctively picked the Tacos de pesdacos ($11), which is the fish version instead of pork belly, beef or shrimp. Ceviche (raw fish \"cooked\" in lime and lemon juice) was another popular item on many tables but we did not feel like having it that day. The tender chunks of grilled snapper dressed in chipotle mayo was smoky and slightly fiery. Admittedly, the tortilla skin was rather stretchy, but that extra red pepper salsa added a desirable crunch and zest to itI imagined the Crab Tostaditas with habanero, avocado and cucumber ($16) to be crunchy and creamy but somehow the dish did not deliver the taste. They were on the light, bland side.Our favourite was this vegan dish, Chiles Relanos($24), an ugly-looking roasted poblano pepper stuffed with rice, herbs and wild mushrooms. Every spoonful of filling with the heavenly pumpkin sauce simply lifts up your mood. So delicious that I did not mind skipping other meaty mains.As a dessert lover, I was sad to see only two items but ended up extremely pleased with the Pastel de Elote Azul ($14), a crumbly cake made with blue cornmeal topped with mezcal alcohol-spiked whipped cream. (Though it was served after 20min and not 5min as informed by the waiter) Moistened with agave nectar, the cake had a unique coarse texture and a subtle sweetness. Who says good cakes must be light and fluffy? This one is divine--a MUST TRY....To conclude, this is definitely the place to go for some authentic Mexican street food. If you are coming here for a full meal, I recommend that you order the main meal that are larger in portions as prices adds up when you order those small-sized appetizers. Plus, the cocktails here are not to be missed for those who loves drinking. Do go early before the crowd streams in as there is no reservations! Go late for their DJ music and u might meet the man in the mask.",
