Three times bigger than the original outlet, what this means is that you can finally sit down and enjoy your croissants and kougin amans in peace without having people bump into you or trying to yell over the din. Everything's the same here, from the menu right down to the delicious bread on offer. While the level and quality of bread is good, I still feel they aren't as good as the ones I had from Maison Kayser, but that could just be biased views at play.",

He had the signature croissant and I ended up choosing pastry with a caramelised sugar glaze on it after trying a sample offered from the friendly staff. The croissant had a nice buttery flavour and the pastry was sweet without being overbearing. Both were very enjoyable, would have gone nice with a cup of coffee. Overall it was an enjoyable experience though I felt perhaps a tad overpriced for what you get.",

One did not have to find a table by ownself anymore. Just wait at the entrance and a staff will assist you to a table with the menu presented to you in a jotter book. Besides the usual pastries and drinks, the menu now also consisted of hot meals.Ebiko Crab & Prawn Toastie ($19++)Cheesy crab & prawns, grilled sourdough, crunchy ebiko & chives. Served with a fresh sprout & cress salad topped with mixed seeds.The bread was quite difficult to slice through with the knife provided. In end it was sent to the kitchen to be sliced into soldiers, so one can easily eat it without using the cutlery. The crust of the slice of bread was quite hard to chew, making my jaw quite painful. The topping was quite tasty and creamy but not cheesy at all.Rainbow Rice Bowl ($16++)Brown & wild rice bowl, poached NZ organic egg, spicy pineapple kimchi, purple potato chips, mixed sprouts, & salsa verdeTopup $3++ for chickenThe dish was presented in a wooden bowl with a wooden spoon. It was a very colorful looking dish. The rice was moist and flavourful but a bit difficult to digest. The chicken was cooked in sous vide style, thus it looked pinkish but it was moist and tender. The pineapple kimchi was quite appetizing.Overall the food was not bad but the standard of bread seem to have gone down a bit.",

    "text": "I recommend this place since it's convenient to get here from nearby hotels (Swiss & Fairmont). But during my week long stay, I am not a fan of the overall food quality nor the overall service.The layout is cramped and can get very loud around lunch time. Some of the seating area is caked with dust, and it stayed that way my entire trip. The food isn't very fresh, or at least half of the time. The baked goods in particular show this. During my stay, I ordered from them a raisin bun, kouign amann, berry tarte, petit antoine, canele, paris brest. Half of those were either stale or dried out. The service leaves more to be desired. Sometimes they're always around, and sometimes they're nowhere to be found. It takes FOREVER to get the check, so long that I regret not ordering takeout. They don't like to take dirty plates away, and instead just leave them on your table. I ordered a croque monsieur and a sunny-side-up egg on top (hence making a croque madame), and they just didn't understand the combination!! 10 minutes later, I received a salmon quiche. I tell them that's not what I ordered, and they ask \"would you like to keep it?\" Yeah No! They have calorie bombs, such as their pancake breakfast sandwich/burger with tater tots, and yet they also have healthier alternatives, such as juices and salads. So on the bright side, the servers & manager are super friendly, and the coffee is made well. I recommend their coffees and their raisin bun. For better quality, I recommend Gastronomia Di Paolo down the hall.",

There are only two choices of ice cream. You can also request for just ice cream in a cup which was what we did. The honey and fig ice cream was delicious and at $2. it was quite a steal in the city center area. It will be $3.50 for the ice cream in the petit croissant. I hope they will retain the price for a long time. Sometimes you just want something simple and easy on the pockets. The pastries are not bad though I find them a bit too hard for my liking. So I will stick with the ice cream over here in future.",

The avocado toast is available from 9, and other brunch food like pancakes only from 11am. Ugh. Still, I'm not complaining, as the croissants are delicious (as ever) and they open relatively early at 8am -- no waiting about for cafes to open at 9 or 10! Grateful for that.",

It was around 9:45 AM on a Friday, so the crowd was minimal. Ordering was easy and my coffee was delivered to my table within a reasonable time frame. I tried the almond brioche, which was a bit dry. Overall, not mind blowing, yet pretty edible. Since I was a bit pressed for time, I ordered the piccolo latte which was absolutely adorable. It's served in an espresso shot glass thingy, complete with great latte art. I found it pricey for $5, but it tasted awesome.Great place to have a meeting, as there's a fountain in the middle that always shoots water randomly. So if you get stuck in an awkward conversation, everyone in the table can just listen to or look at the fountain and hope that the awkwardness will eventually subside.

It's alright, bread stuff is fairly alright but appreciate the range of bake goods this place offers (hence the ability to find said Kouign Amann). If you follow my check ins, I'm a person who seeks out places for awesome coffee art. Though the taste of the mocha was nothing special but the art is elaborate enough for my fancy without me requesting for it. Service staff is prompt, always willing to lend a helping hand. The manager (presumably cos he was not in uniform) tonight even offered to help get my utensils and serviettes seeing that my hands are full. His service was so awesome to a point that i thought he had only eyes for my table of 1 but in actual fact he was helping to serve the whole floor. Top notch service for a simple place.So come here if you are a exotic bread fan or maybe want to see some cute coffee art or just wanna bask in the quality service to feel like a boss after a day of work feeling like a rat in a rat race. :D",

Whichever marketing agency Tiong Bahru bakery engaged with for their ads, they should retain them for life.I walked about 100 meters and found the location nestled next to many other food options. I queued up, placed my order, and found a seat so that I could partake in this bakery item. My first bite lived up to expectations. The croissant was amazing. I cherished every morsel, and after it was over, I was so hooked that I had already made future plans to visit this place. Singapore has many bakeries on the island, but not many specialize in Western bread items. Tiong Bahru bakery gets it, and I'm glad they exist. If you happen to walk by one of their locations, make sure you queue up and grab one of their many deliciously looking baked goodies.",

Most of the baked goods are delicious with the exception of the brioche which, as a previous reviewer mentioned, is dry and makes you kick yourself for not ordering the kouign amman you had your eye on to begin with. I was in Orchard yesterday and saw a new outlet in Tang's. That makes me happy. Two suggestions for the owners: \u00a01) please get rid of those awful pencil-legged tables at the Raffles City outlet and 2) keep it real--don't let the success go to your head!",

    "text": "The signature croissant (eaten up before any photos could be taken) lived up to my expectation partly because I had reheated it in my oven till the crispness I want. But I doubt it will be the same eating in the shop unless they are straight out the oven.  However, I think their Almond croissant with Chocolate filling (left) and Kouig Aman (right) are equally competent , if not better than its croissant if you prefer something sweet. Both flaky and fragrant, the almond croissant was heavenly while the latter, despite its ugly appearance, was swirled with salted caramel remains my personal favourite. If you don't like chocolate, do try the Plain Almond Croissant. It was consumed at room temperature but remained crispy.However, some of the pastries left me in a blur. The Raisin Roll (right) was average while the Pandan Flan (Bottom Left) lacked any distinct pandan aroma or flavour and the pastry was soggy. Meanwhile, The Rapsberry Crumble (Top Left) was underbaked resulting in a slightly chewy lacklustre pastry and the crumble toppings were too little. \u00a0Just as I thought there would be no new items anymore, it's Christmas specials- A Chocolate Snowball Globe tart took me by surprise. Filled with sweet milk chocolate mousse and the tangy pineapple and passionfruit compote, the chocolate ball sat on a crumbly almond tart whose sweetness was just right.At the centre sits a mini delicate red balloon of salty raspberry sauce which burst open at the poke of a fork. This is not something new but still very interesting to have in local bakeries.",

    "text": "At Raffles City, the retail space measures three times that of Tiong Bahru's. It has a very roomy dining area with cushion sofa seats against the wall and movable wooden chairs. Dressed in a self-serviced concept, you will help yourself to a common corner with cutlery, sugar sticks, drinking glasses & bottles of tap water. Facing the bustling Din Tai Fung restaurant, this bakery is no lack of patrons. Spontaneously I joined the line for my order at the counter. In the queue, you could quickly scan through the options \u00a0in the glass display. Categorized in 3 sections, sweet & savory buns/breads being the first; ready-made sandwiches in the middle; cakes & pastries selection the last, before reaching the cashier. Be sure to note your table number so that any beverages/food that requires time to prepare, can be delivered to you efficiently. \u00a0It pays to be aware of the chef signature most of the time although it may not be a hit every time. Here, croissant is the trademark of Cherrier. I have seen mixed reviews on this viennoiserie bread - some find it excessively rich and buttery while others are hooked on them. I agreed with the latter, it was very good. One could tell the difference at first sight - very distinctive thick airy folds. The crust is very tenderizing and instead of being crumbly, each flake held firmly to the dough pretty well. Lesser mess on the table as a result. Unlike other French style croissant, this one taste less buttery than those \"ultra-rich\" dead-oily ones. The one at Paul Bakery perhaps should stand aside and I gladly choose them over Wild Honey's. Even though, I still love the ones at Maison Kayser, Cherrier's suit me better - seriously a balanced and less weighty taste.I see many eulogizing the breton cake - Kouign Aman; strangely, I idolized the Almond Brioche for its endearing taste. It didn't appear catchy but somewhat burnt and stiff. Don't belittle this slab that arrives massive. I am surprised by its light fluffy texture when I knifed it. Encircled by a crisp crust, the middle was moist and almond-rich with a gentle sweetness. While people next to my table were busy chatting, my dining partner saw me busy gnawing on the slab!",

    "text": "Er, no it ain't halal. I just went there with a Chinese friend during fasting month once. She was hungry and wanted to fuel up, so we ended up in this popular bakery. It's self-service at this store, so while my friend scrambled off to pick some bites, I made a quick inspection of the premises. The bakery oozes a casual vibe and boasts such a wide array of breads, even I was tempted to try some. Prices are mid-range.My friend returned to our table with a cup of hot chocolate, a croissant and a Squid Ink Bun with Smoked Salmon and Ham sandwich.The Squid Ink bun does look exotic with its jet-black appearance. \u00a0She said the hot chocolate was chocolatey enough. She loved the croissant - it was crunchy but did not splinter to little pieces. Her sandwich was piled high with heaps of fresh greens and slices of smoked salmon and ham. My friend could not sense any distinct squid ink flavour but found the bread very soft and buttery. I was just sitting at the table, watching her eat. Evil woman.I do hope some day Tiong Bahru bakery sets up a halal outlet somewhere. Then I could try their mouth-watering offerings myself!",

    "text": "Tiong Bahru Bakery at Raffles City is the second outlet of the very popular Tiong Bahru Bakery at Tiong Bahru. The location might be less quaint, but it's way more accessible for us city folks. The new branch takes over the space that was formerly Aerin's and is triple the size of its first outlet. The croissants are, I'm pleased to report, as good as the ones from the original outlet, and there seems to be more variety here. I still love the almond croissants but reckon other places offer a better lemon tart, this one was a bit too tart for my liking (largely prefer the ones from Canele, PS Cafe and Wild Honey) and the crust not as crumbly as I normally would have liked. A lunch and dinner menu will be available soon, so it'll be interesting to see what they are offering then.",
