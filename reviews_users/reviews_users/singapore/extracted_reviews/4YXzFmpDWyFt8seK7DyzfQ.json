    "text": "My favorite Sushi restaurant in Katong located on the East Cost Road side of Roxy Square. Like many eateries in Katong, this has a great \"neighborly\" feel to it with two cool sushi chefs and really friendly wait staff. The Oki Sashimi for two is a staple assortment of fish for $48. The Fish is fresh, but not crazy mouthwatering (i.e. not super premium) as you would expect at some high-end establishments. If you have a craving for great tasting sushi at sensible prices, there is no better place than Wahiro. \u00a0Wahiro's Tempura, on the other hand, is simply AWESOME! My shrimp tempura, in particular, was just cooked to perfection: crispy, tasty with the flaky batter finish. Personally, I am not a fan of tempura without \"flakes\".However, the BEST part about Wahiro and the Reason why I give Wahiro 5-stars. They give FREE Re-Fills of WHITE RICE! Yes! Yes! and Yes ahain! Have you ever heard of a Japanese Restaurant giving free re-fills of white rice in Singapore. No Way! \u00a0For a white-rice loving Filipino American Man, this is music to my ears! Dude!!!Yes, I know white rice costs $1 everywhere else, but still... :D",

The salmon sashimi was of good quality and the portion was generous - worth the money. But some of the other dishes like the tuna, tuna belly, cod were all disappointing - its not priced as very cheap either so I would expect the quality to be higher. Have visited here twice now and the experience has been the same...unlikely to try for a third time lucky.",

    "text": "Our favourite neighbourhood sushi spot!This place is only convenient if you live in the East Coast Road area, as it's not near any MRT. I would say that it is a step above the mass-market sushi joints, and probably below the more higher end spots in the area (read: Tomi Sushi.) In other words, it's just right. :)If you're in the mood for sashimi and you're dining with someone, I recommend getting the Oki sashimi. It's 20 pieces of assorted fish for $48. Their sets are very good value, too, especially if you go for lunch. For $15++, you have a choice between sushi and sashimi, and then you can choose other small items like fried food or hot dishes. Though the fish portions are small, the various other dishes make up for it. I've been here when the restaurant is busy and quiet, and for the most part the service is friendly. I paid by card once, and the server bringing my bill even said, \"Thanks, Michelle!\" after I signed. Nice touch!",

Now lets get to the food.Sashimi wise/ sushi - the fishes are fresh with reasonable prices. However don't expect too quality sashimi with the amount you're paying. The wasabi could have been freshly grated as well. Do try the foie gras sushi. The creamy foie gras went well with the sushi rice.Yakiniku - the huge variety of grilled dishes seemed to be the specialty of the places. Decent portions and pricing. Taste wise, well executed.Rice bowls - had the Wagyu beef rice bowl which was delicious. Would recommend this. Soup - clam soup. The sweetness of the clams were not taste and the Miso was underwhelming. Not recommended considering the price? Service was attentive and friendly. Would return to try more of the grilled stuff. Lunch sets are affordable.",

While the nigiri lunch set comes with 9 sushi and a great value at $28, I liked the cooked dishes that came with the lunch set better, like the chawanmushi, the fried tofu-chicken croquette. If I return, will probably stick to the cooked dishes and skip the sashimi/sushi.",

    "text": "Wahiro is a family run Japanese restaurant at the entrance of Roxy Square that serves authentic Japanese cuisine. The prices of the food here are higher than usual Japanese restaurant but it is still reasonable since the overall experience was enjoyable with good service and quality food. The concept of the restaurant is pretty interesting. Customers sit in a row at bar stools in front of the kitchen where the cooks take your orders directly and make the dishes on the spot right before your eyes. The most memorable dishes were the Nigiri Sushi set and Oden. The Nigiri Sushi set came with 8 different sushis each with their unique toppings. The raw fish over the rice were cut in generous sizes and were extremely fresh and delightful. The oden, which is basically radish and fish cakes stewed in a broth, was a simple yet savory dish that warms the heart. This is one of the more authentic Japanese restaurants in the east. Despite the price, the food is still pretty much value for money.",

So where is this?Okay so this place is in a dingy mall; if you've ever been to Roxy Square (not 2, but the original one), you'll know what I mean. But that in no way should discourage you from coming to eat here.. I mean, doesn't everyone want great food? And I mean, it's so good, I've been here three times this past month.You walk up to Roxy Square, and chances are, you're on the Parkway Parade side... and you'll walk around the WHOLE building. Wise up next time and come around the East Coast Road side, otherwise known as the Katong side.And now if you're still reading this, you deserve to discover the amazing awesomeness that is the Daily Lunch bento set at Wahiro. It feels so authentic - you can choose the raised platform seats (so your legs+feet go down in this hole under your table), and the place settings are just so. Then you pick from the bento set list, and you'll want the get the Daily Special. Sometimes, a little mystery is good for you. It's not all random - you get to pick some things, like a fried option (ebi tempura is always the answer), but there's a hot dish that is always a chef's choice. I had a ginat shumai once... and the \"skin\" was a crepe-like thin omelette. Yum.Each element in your bento feels so well made, and it feels like you should eat each dish in a particular order, just to make sure you're tasting all the awesomeness the chef intended.When it's all over, which is too soon, you'll get your customary cold triangle (yes, very hipster) of watermelon... and you are politely left alone to finish your tea. And that's when you'll wish you had put in the extra bento order. You'll learn that for next time.",

I had the Tempura set, and I requested not to have the tempura veggies because I don't eat them. I was prepared to forgo the additional veg, but they kindly offered to replace the veggies wtih smaller salmon pieces instead, which I thought was really good and proactive of them. Also not too expensive - lunch sets going for around $20 for quite a fair spread of food of good quality, definitely worth it.If you're parking, don't make my mistake of parking on side facing Parkway! It's at Roxy Square 1 which is facing the East Coast road side, a little way down from 112 Katong.",
