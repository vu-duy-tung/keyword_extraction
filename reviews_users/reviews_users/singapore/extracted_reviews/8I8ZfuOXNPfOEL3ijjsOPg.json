I tried their \" Rising Sun\" ...Its pretty good... except I would preferred it with less wasabi. \u00a0 They also served other side dishes. On the whole, its pretty yummy! Would love to go back and try the other items on their menu.",

It had quite oily taste although it had the right texture with the chewy rice, juicy crab meat and tamago, and the popping fish roe. But it was just too oily to have.

The tuna sashimi tasted a bit off to me.FOREST SALAD ($7.90)MAIN: Sauteed MushroomDRESSING: Wafu SauceCal: 200 kcalThe mushrooms were well cooked but the dish was let down by the over used of black pepper here. It just tasted of black pepper which covered the nature taste of mushrooms.Service not bad, but the food got to improve some.",

It did get messy towards the end as unlike a proper wrap, it is only the paper covering the end of the roll. I do wonder what will happen to the other half when someone just order a half portion. The potato salad was good, typical Japanese style. The salad was also refreshing but it was not very filling. So do not order just that if you are feeling hungry. The can of royal milk tea was not that great as it was not sweet or milky enough for my liking. Maybe I am too used to the Taiwanese style milk tea now.",

    "text": "A highly disappointing meal. Got the rising sun (salmon and crab meat) burrito ($6.90 for half) and was attached by an overpowering taste of wasabi on the first bite. The wasabi sauce was unevenly squeezed and the burrito was not wrapped properly, causing bits of salmon, crab meat and lettuce to fall out even before the third mouth. I wouldn't have minded the mess if the taste made up for it, but it was nothing exceptional (maybe exceptionally messy and exceptionally overpriced). The seating here is spacious but there are few tables available, though it is rather empty during a weekday lunch hour (while the nearby toastbox, tsujiri and subway are all filled). Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place unless there is really no other choice - it wouldn't make good for a quick grab as well as the waiting time for the food was also significantly long.",

    "text": "What is a sushi burrito? A big fat sushi. Sucks because you only get one flavor. The bottom line, a normal roll is better. I prefer my sushi bite sized and small enough so that I can dip them in my wasabi soy sauce concoction. Overall, this wouldn't be a place that I would come too often. Funny bc I'm currently the Duchess as I write this post, and the reason why I checked three times was because I purchased three Groupon vouchers. I would come back, but not because of cravings, solely bc of convenience. At the same time, I prefer the standard supermarket sushi downstairs at FairPrice Finest.  The food isn't anything to rave about and definitely can't be compared to the sushi rolls we have in the States (Lion King or Dragon Roll anyone?).",

The tempura roll was the lesser of two evils (2.5 stars) but the rice was mushy so don't expect any bite in the seaweed. Perhaps they could pack their seaweed separately so it's dry and crispy for you to wrap on when it arrives - Equinox and Swissotel used to serve their sushi at their Sunday brunch buffet like that. I couldn't take more than two bites of the other option (which had what looked like crabstick and raw tuna or salmon - my friends placed the order so I don't know what they're called) (1 star). The raw fish didn't taste fresh and made me nauseated.",
