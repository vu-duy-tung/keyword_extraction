We had some other dishes as well but I can't remember what they were because of how good the crab was. A friend of mine who is a chef working in Singapore took us around to the places he thought were the best and this place did not disappoint. The owner and his son even came out with a bottle of Remy (not on the menu) and took a couple of shots with us. After the shots they left the bottle for us to enjoy at our leisure. Talk about excellent customer service! I was a little under the weather but still enjoyed myself. I' love to go back healthy with an empty stomach!Not so humbly submitted,Michael C.",

    "text": "I've heard lots of good things about Keng Eng Kee (KEK) Seafood in Bukit Merah and decided to give it a try along with a family birthday celebration. It was easy to make a phone reservation just a day before, but do call earlier if you have firmed up plans, to ensure air-con availability. \u00a01. \u00a0Salted Egg Crab $70/kg *highly recommended*Crabs seem to command better prices that rare minerals like gold or diamonds! It was just 2 years ago when 1kg of crabs cost $50, but nevertheless, these Indian crabs are fleshy. The salted egg sauce was so good, you know it's real salted egg and not the powered artificial salted egg, due to the graininess of the sauce. Not to mention, the taste. Sadly, KEK does no serve fried mantous, only the steamed mantous at $1 per piece. In the background of this photo, you can see 2 mantous, they're pretty big but I would still prefer to dip fried mantous into the sauce. The crab tasted reasonably fresh, but I felt that the chef had fried the crab for too long, resulting in the meat being stuck to parts of the shell.2. Ming Zhu Roll *highly recommended*This mingzhu roll is definitely a worthy cause to visit KEK. With salted egg right in the middle, this is so pretty and yet delicious. This dish came straight to our table within 2 minutes of ordering. I was confused if this order belonged to another table, but the staff insisted it was for us. The batter is light and crispy. The mushrooms were juicy and added alot of flavour.3. Fried Hor Fun $5/$8 *highly recommended*Probably their number 1 seller is their fried hor fun. Served with a raw egg. This dish is one of a kind, the wok hei can be subtly picked up by you sense of smell, but the taste of the wok hei is so vivid to your tastebud! The egg helps to make the hor fun wet, and when we ordered both a $5 and a $8 portion, we felt that they gave the same amount of ingredients, with 1 egg in each dish. Maybe they gave us more noodles, but we couldn't see the difference.There's prawns, lup cheong (chinese sausage), squids and some slices of fish mixed into the delicious and fragrant fried hor fun. I definitely want to come back to KEK seafood for this!4. Fried Prawn Paste ChickenA family favourite that we usually order at every zi char, tasted rather ordinary here at KEK. The pieces were quite small and wasn't quite what we expected since the other dishes had set our expectations much higher. Skip this and also skip the hot plate tofu, it was bland and a waste of $10.5. Coffee Pork Ribs *highly recommended*The coffee pork ribs were so addictive. The meat was boneless and tender. The coffee sauce wasn't too sweet or over powering. The meat had a tad sweetness and chewiness in every bite. The coffee sauce was the bomb!Overall : A great place for a family meal. It cost us $180 including drinks for 7 adults.",

    "text": "I came to KEK once several years ago without realizing how big of a following this restaurant has. In a typical coffeeshop setting, it didn't look anymore impressive than any other tze char stall. However, one of my friends had told me KEK was one of his favourite \"go to\" tze char so I made a point to revisit. This time around, with my family to celebrate a birthday. \u00a0Alas, 3 days before the actual event, we couldn't book the aircon rooms. But luckily for us, it was a cool night and it was fine sitting outdoors.We ordered \u00a0quite a bit of their popular dishes - chili crab with mantou, salted egg yolk crab, 3-egg spinach, prawn paste chicken, mixed platter of fried appetizers, coffee ribs, moonlight horfun. \u00a0Most impressive was the moon light hor fun HANDS DOWN. \u00a0$8 for a medium portion gave us a large plate enough for 6 full bowls or 7 slightly less-full bowls. \u00a0The horfun was full of wok hei, full of lardy flavouring agents like lard cubes, lap cheong and seafood (fish slices, prawns and squid rings). \u00a0Was very very satisfying and luckily we didn't have extras for I would have walloped them all (bad for waistline!).The rest of the food was good but nothing extraordinary. \u00a0The biggest let down was the famed salted egg yolk crab. The sauce was paltry, but most importantly, the crab was overcooked and the meat stuck onto the crab :( \u00a0The chili crab fared better. While not particularly impressive, the sauce was eggy and morish enough to down a couple of pillow soft flower twist mantou \u00a0(these deserves a highlight - they were so soft!). Note there is no fried mantous here. \u00a0All these dishes for merely $207 with change! \u00a0We even had leftovers to pack up.",

    "text": "I went here with my Singaporean friends and they did all the ordering. \u00a0And I think all were flavorful and cooked well.The Ming Zou rolls I think is their best seller, quite delicious. \u00a0We had the chili crabs, pepper crabs and salted egg crabs and the best one was the salted egg crabs. \u00a0I also recommend the fried battered squid, the roast chicken and the leafy vegetables with eggs. \u00a0Both the marmite pork and chicken were good -- don't worry, if you are not a marmite fan, the marmite flavor was not very strong. \u00a0Everyone raved about the liver dish but I am not a liver fan so I cannot comment myself.The service was good and quick. \u00a0Am just not sure if the ordering will be easy if I was not with chinese speaking folks. \u00a0I hope their menus have photos!I have been here twice for dinner but both at very odd times -- at 5pm and another at 930pm -- so the parking was quite easy. \u00a0If you come early, I suggest booking a table inside the air conditioned room so its not too hot. \u00a0If you are doing a late dinner, then its ok to sit outside.",
