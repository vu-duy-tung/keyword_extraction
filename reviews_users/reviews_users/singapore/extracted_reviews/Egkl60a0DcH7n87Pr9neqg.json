    "text": "On a recent trip to Singapore I went to this place twice even though I wasn't staying at the Grand Hyatt but at a nearby hotel.It's in the basement of the hotel and actually pretty large overall. It's pretty nice inside without being over the top. I tried to use the website to make a reservation and it said nothing was available. I walked over there earlier in the day to both find the place and to see if I could secure a reservation. He promised he would have something available for me later that night. As it turned out the place wasn't crowded at all so I'm not sure why the website said nothing was available at that time and day.Overall it's pretty informal at least for the Grand Hyatt and that's what I was looking for.They have a a pretty nice salad and bread bar. Lots of different kinds of bread to chose from. I went with the bruschetta and it was pretty standard and quite good.My favorite was the pasta puttanesca. Pretty legit Italian and very good.I tried both the afagatto and pana cotta and both were could, I recommend either one.Portions were about average size which is enough to fill you up without being too much.Service was good overall the staff I encountered were all very nice.The place isn't cheap but fair for what it is and what you get.If your looking for a decent Italian place with reasonable prices then Pete's is a good choice.",

    "text": "A throwback to the Italian dining scene in Singapore in the 80's: grim, dark d\u00e9cor with low ceiling; noisy Muzak with nondescript music. The food is extremely traditional and ranges from bad (eg. mushy pizza) to mediocre (the two pastas on offer at brunch) to average (eg. baked fish). With so many great Italian restaurants in Singapore now, why bother? If you have the one-for-one offer with the Hyatt Club membership, it may be worth a try. Otherwise, you'd certainly be better off elsewhere. Service is also 80's style - very attentive and friendly!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I am unbashed fanatic fan of Pete's Place. My wife and I had our first date at Pete's Place in October, 1987 on a Friday night before the stock market crash. The food and ambience were outstanding and, along with my wife's smile and laugh that evening, helped create an indelible, enduring and enchanting memory. We have returned over the years to re-live the moment until a few years when my wife stopped drinking wine and cut back on bread, pasta and pizza. \u00a0But Pete's Place has never lost the magic. The staff is exceptionally friendly and attentive. The best feature of Pete's Place is the weekday Plant Buffet .... no meats .... great salad bar, veggies, breads, soups, pizza and amazing desserts. Great for a business meeting ... sit down and talk as long as you want and when the hunger hits, head for the buffet. While it is buffet I still tip because they deliver a good experience. My only criticism applies to all good buffets ... I load up and overeat (gained 1.6 kilos to be exact). My dream is to get my wife back there some evening and split a nice bottle of wine with her, just like the old days. If the crew at Pete's Place can help me pull that off, they can add another zero to the tip.",

The porcetta the restaurant specialty and the supposed US beef which turned out to be cheap Australian cuts \u00a0and all the other The hot dishes ran out by 830, and we were left with 4 trays of rubbery pasta, frozen pizzas, and a raw bar of prawns and mussels after a tepid antipasto. There was a plate of ham, some Hungarian salami, and some mozzarella that was past due and sour. A very nice man, Mehmet the manager, after I mentioned \u00a0that all dishes were finished, arranged a single pork chop for our party of 6 to enjoy, and his staff kept our glasses filled with an inexpensive prosecco. HE was obviously ashamed, and wanted to make things right, but his chef or F and B manager Spoiled our Christmas Eve dinner, and embarrassed me as the host having chosen this place. He did give us a box of chocolates from the hotel as a consolation prize. Other than the ice cream, the deserts were stale and past due as well, all in all, sub par at best. There is no decent Italian food available there, just some faux hotel style pizza pasta and a minuscule selection of antipasto, nothing resembling anything better than a 5 out of 10 in quality. Best directed at expense account travelers.",

    "text": "Walk down the stairs to the basement level of Grand Hyatt Hotel and one will be greeted by the nostalgic sight of traditional Italian trattoria that makes you feel as though you are coming home. There is much buzz around this enduringly popular family-friendly Italian restaurant as the food is refreshingly simple yet decently priced, especially when every main course ordered include a self-plated salad and free flow of Italian bread. Free flow of Homemade Italian Bread and Butter Spread with Every Main CourseBread lovers like me will find it extremely difficult to resist the wonderful carbs here. The olive and sundried tomato foccacia or the grissini sticks underpin all the necessary aspects of the authentic Italian approach.The salad bar is such a great idea that it should be introduced in more local restaurants. From alfalfa sprouts, baby asparagus to marinated mushrooms, tuna or sun-dried tomatoes, there is a wide selection of freshly sourced greens that can be pimped up with in-house dressings and the yummy shavings CHEESE. The salad bar may not be free flow but one plate is more than sufficient as the delicious main courses are waiting ahead. The Gamberi e Nero de Sepoia ($29) is one exemplary Italian dish which the ingredients speak for themselves. No rich heavy cream but just a clear base of seafood broth that brimmed with the sweetness of seafood, parsley and garlic. The springy and fresh seared prawns and length-sliced chillis at a cheery flavour to the toothsome Italian \"mee pok'\". We were deliberating between the hearty Sustainable Fish Stew with Baguette ($32) and this Pan Seared Cod Fish ($36) but chose the latter in the end. The fatty white fish luxuriates in a shallow pool of Parsnip pur\u00e9e and creamy spinach, flanked with tart radish and yellow Polenta Cubes which resembled mango cubes. I wished the cod skin could be crispier but the overall dish was wholesome and satisfying, not overwhelmingly heavy in seasoning that would have robbed away the beauty of the fish. We had to bade goodbye without trying the classic dolci like Tiramisu and Amaretti Chocolate Pudding this time round as we were heading to Mezza9 for the divine desserts. But this means a legitimate reason to come back for the wooden fire pizzas and more pastas next time, probably through their value for money set dinner or the Sunday Brunch when I can conquer all dishes with a glass of Prosecco.",

The food is decent, it isn't mind blowing (and that isn't a bad thing, not all food should be), it's good, consistent stuff. What was amazing though - the lobster ravioli and the buffalo mozzarella. Bursting with flavour, both are must orders. Was not impressed by the pizza. The crust tasted like it was frozen crust. But maybe it was an off night for the pizza guy. That aside, it's a lovely little place. Cozy and homey, someplace you could bring your parents.",

You can't fake a good marinara and Pete's \"Ciopinno\" promises lobster, vongole, prawns, scallops, crabmeat and fresh herbs. Reads like my dream dish. At S$42++ in the basement of the Grand Hyatt (having come here on good yelper ratings) my expectations were pretty damn high. Sadly, my expectations were not to be met at Pete's. Not even close. Over cooked pasta and seafood in a gluggy, under seasoned tomato sauce with way too much sugar (why do restaurants in Asia insist on jamming their dishes up with bucket loads of sugar). This was on par with the worst marinara I've ever had.Had a quick scan of the salad bar which looked very ordinary so I skipped salad.I can't even say that it was okay for Asian Italian... It was just plain bad. Sadly I have to recommend avoiding this one folks.",

After you have ordered, you can head down to the bread bar and choose from the many varieties they have. Three different butters are available, the plain unsalted, herb butter and tomato butter. all are good. you you can just dip in olive oil. \u00a0If you order your mains before 7, you also get to eat from their salad bar, which is a nice touch. Dishes you have to try include, Cioppino, which is a thick tomato based seafood pasta. Full of scallops, clams, prawns and half a lobster. The broth is thick and homely, seafood is amazing and very fresh. Lobster ravioli with truffle oil- Most of the raviolis here are very good. When come here in a group , we usually order this as a starter to share. The filling is very good and goes well with the delicious sauce, which can be moped up with the bread, which comes from the bread bar.The lamb rack come is very nicely done. It comes with a stuffed eggplant, which is delicious. Pets's place also makes a very good tiramisu, very balanced. All in all a very good place for italian food.",

I like its intimate yet classy atmosphere - dark varnished wooden chairs, checkered tablecloths, oak cabinets... I'm sure any Italian maman would be proud.I have heard a lot about their buffets but I am usually go for the a la carte. Get their antipasti to share - a plateful of selected and cured meats that will start of your meal on a good note. For mains, my favourite has always been Gamberi - homemade linguine is tossed in olive oil and parsley, accompanied by lightly grilled prawns. If you are keen on having a pizza, get the prosciutto - the sharp salty taste of the meat contrasts nicely with the wood-baked crust.",
