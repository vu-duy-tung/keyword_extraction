    "text": "When in Singapore, there is no way of not visiting Gardens by the Bay. However, for those who have too little time to look at the botanical gardens or who would rather invest the admission money in a drink, the Super Trees will be the place to be, as they are the highlight of the gardens. The plants-covered steel frames are between 25 and 50 meters high. They are used for the breeding of rare plants and at night lit by solar power. Rain is collected in their funnels for the irrigation of the plants. Some of the trees serve as cooling towers for the cooling systems of the garden's domes. Two of the towers are connected with a bridge at a staggering height.In one of the trees you will find the Indochine, a restaurant with a cocktail lounge on the roof terrace, from where you can enjoy a spectacular view onto the city.",

For the price, however, the food is just so-so. We ordered the fried rice, the tiger prawns, and the crispy lychee with pork loin and bacon. The lychee with pork loin and bacon was delicious, and one of the best things I've ever had; the other two dishes were all right, but nothing special.If you really want to, you can pay the $10 fee to go up and get your complimentary soda, but I think your money will be better spent by going to the Skypark at Marina Bay Sands.",

    "text": "Gardens by the Bay are magnificent, but there's no reason to drink or eat at Supertree by IndoChine. Their service is some of the worst ever - awful, rude, bored staff who ignored everybody on a Saturday evening and seemed to have no care for their jobs or guests. No one ever came to our table for anything. We had to walk five feet to the bar/service terminal to 1. ask to order, 2. ask for our drinks, 3. ask for tap water (which they didn't want to serve us without paying for it), and 4. ask to pay our bill. Just terrible. Food was decent but costly ($90 for four plates, understandable considering the locale) but drinks were weak and offered almost no choices: one basic rail/cheap alcohol with one mixer for $18 (gin & tonic, whiskey & coke, etc.) The bar is completely outdoors so if it's too hot or too cold you're fully exposed with no wind barrier, no fans, no ac, no shade. Even the view is better from the OCDC Sky Bridge below. Skip this unnecessary and poorly run bar in the sky, especially considering the worst service we've seen anywhere in Asia in 25 years.

When we said we were ordering food and asked again about a table they asked- well, what are you ordering? \u00a0Since we weren't ordering 'a full meal' they still refused us a table. We attempted to order for quite a while and were attentively ignored! When finally ordering the drinks included in the ticket, the list was limited and they refused to accommodate any requests, even though all the ingredients were on the included list and wouldn't apply the cost of the $18 ticket to a cocktail. When we finally got our orders, the drink was watered down and the food made both of us sick!",

Upon entering the entire wait staff greets you as you walk in from the elevator. The decor reminds me a bit of a Vegas casino...flashy. It's an odd system, they have you select and order from an iPad, \u00a0but then you still have to call your server over to confirm the order. Then upon the server placing the order, the iPad is taken away and paper menus were brought out later when we asked about dessert. The food comes with a hefty price tag and the taste does not merit that price tag in my opinion. We split a starter platter for appetisers. I had the portobello mushroom for dinner (it was ok). My husband had the lamb which he really enjoyed. We had the coffee creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. It was actually really good. We enjoyed going up to the rooftop bar (which was closed due to weather) to take pictures and our daughters also enjoyed going down for the fantastic light show. I am very grateful we had the opportunity to try SuperTree, but once was just fine.",

Don't get me wrong the food is satisfactory. Just not mind blowing. But the view is gorgeous. 360 beauty, no matter where you sit. And kind and respectful service (duh, you're in Singapore). In my opinion, it's worth the once in a lifetime experience. As long as you're approaching it that way. If you're wondering what I ordered, it was the rice paper wrapped ground chicken. Tasty enough. I'd order it again if I was ever in the area and just had no other option",

It cost about $20 SGD per person for entrance fee, which includes one free drink which is reasonable. Pros: Really a spectacular view. My boyfriend and I was here when there was still some sunlight and stayed until the sun went down. I really enjoyed the view and it felt somewhat \"romantic\". A great place to take amazing photography. Cons: You don't get to see the night show from here, so don't come up here expecting to see the night show. The food is very very overpriced for mediocre food, but it is what it is since it's a tourist area. Yes there's an open bar, but seats can be limited. It's not a huge area so expect to not have a place to sit, which is a bummer. Definitely give it a try if you want to experience the view, but not somewhere I'll come back for a small snack or meal. Way too expensive.",

I went around 7pmish and stayed maybe for about an hour looking at the sunset! When the sun is out, you can see the sea and land of Singapore and when the sun goes down, you can see the lights of the city!

When you are with a big party, the waiters are \"somewhat\" reasonable... meaning the show up once every 15 minutes. If you are with a 10 year old girl, you have to shoot up a flare for service and LITERALLY GET UP OUT OF YOUR CHAIR AND FIND A SERVER - I KID YOU NOT. Not once, not twice, but THREE times.I knew we were in for a long night, when we arrived at the top and they immediately escorted us to \"our\" table. Not much of a walk. About 15 feet from the elevator but we had an amazing view of the hostess desk. A nice touch given that the restaurant was only 1/2 occupied. I asked for a new table which they found us but only after a lot of scowling, attitude and obvious annoyance.I waited for 40 minutes to be served a drink and even longer to get our food. We ordered the lobster and the lamb. The lobster was cold with a thick layer of cheese on it. The lamb, well, the Pita Pit in SF has much better cuts only the Pita Pit seasons it better. One lamb chop was crushed, yes crushed. Looked like someone drove their heel into the lamb down the slaughter chute. While waiting in misery, the group next to us was a table of 10, very good looking Singaporean men and women. Obviously out for a celebration or corporate event. The manager was smarmy to say the least and was dropping by to see how they were doing, while standing with his ass next to our table. He never even gave us a second look, but was checking on them to make sure they had what they needed.Ah, the check, or for my English friends, the bill. I am not sure what the FX spot rate is for SGD (I am an investment banker) but at $380 Sing dollars, I thought it as some sort of joke. nope, it wasn't and it also wasn't funny. Not only should you avoid this tourist trap, you should picket it for the cruel and unusual punishment of the human species.Billy",

    "text": "We didn't eat there and maybe that's where the negative reviews stem from but for $18 to get a drink and a heat respite with a view, I'm sold. You pay $18 for a drink in many places in Singapore so the view to me was a nice bonus. Staff was nice and you can go to an open air area on top and just soak in the views as well. It's a great place to plan to hit after walking around the gardens working up a sweat. I was very glad we stumbled upon it as it never came up in my pre research.",

    "text": "We are visiting from California so our friends took us to this once because he thought it will be a wonderful experience. \u00a0 The view is nice but good is below average. I would say it's the worst food for whole lot of money. We ordered a bottle of cheap wine for 105 dollars. \u00a0It needed to breathe a little but \u00a0our waiter started to pour into our glasses right away while my husband was trying to tell him to wait. \u00a0My husband and friend ordered lemongrass sea bass and I ordered tiger prawn and pomelo salad while other friend ordered Vietnamese style beef. \u00a0I almost fell out of my chair when I saw my salad. It said tiger prawn but it was more like kitten shrimp. I m not joking about the size of three shrimp that as in the salad. \u00a0When I questioned the size after I saw someone next to me ordering different tiger prawn dish which was decent size, they said because mine was salad. \u00a0Sure, since I must look stupid that I should accept that answer. The dressing on the salad did not go well with pomelo since it was Vietnamese fish sauce dressing. \u00a0With most being the pomelo, and the small portion I still couldn't finish it because it was so salty and overwhelming smell of fish sauce. When it was time for our check, they informed us we need to spend 70 more dollars since it's required to spend at least 80 per person. \u00a0Since we know the quality of the food and the taste, our guys decided in couple of cognacs which was 28 dollars each. It must have been a joke because the serving size was a barely a sip. \u00a0 I understand that they must have to pay high rent to charge so much but the serving sizes there was a joke as well as the waiters and rest of the working staff. \u00a0They were not trained to recommend or tell us about the spending until we got the check, they didn't know who ordered what so they try to give me my husbands dish, \u00a0they were not informed about the wine to let it breathe, trying to explain why my tiger prawn was so small compare to other people's tiger prawns dish by telling me because mine was a salad. \u00a0The service staff isn't well trained for the place where they charge so much money for not so edible good. Do not waste money for it really isn't worth it even for the view.",

    "text": "We visited Supertree by Indochine to celebrate our anniversary. We had been told it was worth the expense. We wanted to take on nice views of Singapore and basically indulge ourselves, so we were willing to spend more than usual.The restaurant has a nice environment, but the view from inside is rather mediocre. To begin with, there's too much light inside, so most of what we could see through the glass was a reflection of what was happening behind us. The menu is extensive and consists of modern Western and Southeast Asian dishes. The food is, in fact, good (not impressive) and (mostly) worth the price. We had a tasty dinner prepared with quality ingredients and good flavours. So far, so good. The problem comes with the drinks or, to be more specific, with certain drinks. We found that beer and wine are exceedingly overpriced. I'm talking SGD $15++ for a miserable half pint (yes, half) of Tiger, and red wine for no less than SGD $105++ a bottle. On the other hand, single malts or good vodkas cost around SGD $18 a shot, which is, in fact, cheaper than many other places I've visited in Singapore. So, the key is to read the drinks menu and choose carefully.The rooftop bar is where the good view is. It has a very relaxed vibe, a mostly tourist-looking crowd, and chill-out music that is easy to ignore. The food menu for the bar seems like \u00a0overpriced bar food, so it should be avoided. We stayed there for a few drinks and enjoyed ourselves. I'm giving it three stars because of that, maybe my good mood clouds my judgement.My recommendation for the best experience would be to visit the rooftop bar just before sunset and enjoy the views while having drinks, then maybe have dinner at the restaurant, and leave rather early to enjoy and take a few pictures of Gardens By the Bay at night, which is the real treat.",

    "text": "Ironically, although I'm not the first to review this restaurant on Yelp! I'm actually the person that entered the business into the system. Frankly, I did so with the intent of providing a fairly negative review -- but I see some diligent Yelpers beat me to it. Either way, here it goes:The food is actually relatively good. Not great -- just good. It's seemingly a sort of fusion Malay/Straits cuisine mixed with Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian influence. The view is also quite nice, as it is in the top of one of the Supertree structures at Singapore's new Gardens by the Bay (worth a visit). Likewise, the bar one floor up provides a good vista.That's the good news. Here is the rest of the story:1. The prices are outrageous. Our bill for three dishes and soup (excluding drinks and no alcohol) came to over S$125. This is particularly egregious in a food paradise of a city where you can get better at hawker centers for $2-$5 per plate easily. Even fairly upscale restaurants in the malls won't run nearly that much. So these prices are for food that was probably in the bottom 25% for taste on our trip to Singapore -- a city with which I am a fairly regular visitor.2. The \"admission\" to get to the restaurant is S$10/person. Keep in mind that this isn't deducted from the price of the meal if you eat at the restaurant. Since this is an attraction (the Supertree-top view) I could see charging admission if people wanted to just go up and hang out; but really if we are eating there and paying beyond-top-dollar in their restaurant, it should be applied toward that. I've eaten at a few \"tower\" restaurants around the world in buildings/structures that required entrance fee and in every case they apply the \"ticket\" cost to the bill if you actually patronize their restaurant.What does come with that S$10 ticket? A voucher for soda. Not alcohol, but soda. I had eaten there, despite hesitation from my wife, because Gardens by the Bay is essentially a botanical theme park, and I had expected to be a little overcharged due to the captive audience effect common to these types of facilities. But it was too much gouging, and we left feeling distinctly fleeced.Gardens by the Bay is a fantastic attraction, and obviously a lot of loving care went into its creation. I therefore understand why they might rent the restaurant space in the Supertree to Indochine to make up some of the cost and help pay its way. However, given the restaurant's extortionate pricing and admission, I think the Garden should consider if it's worth having otherwise happy guests leave with this sour taste in their mouths.Honestly, the value makes it definitely one-star, but in fairness I gave it a \"2\" for the \"3\" level of the food.",

With that said, the price here is still unjustifiable.The bar review: We didn't have to pay an entrance fee (maybe because we were dining at the restaurant). I believe if you pay you will get a wrist bracelet that gives you a complimentary drink. We ended up ordering a glass of wine ($19) and a cocktail ($20+). I like the chill vibe of this rooftop bar. It is like a casual/unfancy version of Lantern at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. I like that it is uncovered and that I could smell the freshness from the gardens and the sea breeze.Overall yes it is overpriced but if you're looking for a chilled and relaxing bar with a view then I think it's the place :)",
