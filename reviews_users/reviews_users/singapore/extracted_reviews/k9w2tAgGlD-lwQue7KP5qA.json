I looked up the menu and saw they had pizzas, including with buffalo mozzarella. Searched a bit more and found they had a wood fire burning oven. And that the pizzas are Neapolitan style. So I had to go! My blog post here is the result mylifeinsin.com/2014/01/\u2026Both my fianc\u00e9 and myself adored it! We were just so happy! We sat outside looking into the lovely shop house (love the Venice map on the floor, nice touch) and listened I the wine list, picked a lovely one, ordered starters (bruschetta and a take on caprese salad), a bufala margherita pizza for me and the pasta of the day (squid ink with crab and squid) for the other half (al dente, proper al dente) and desserts (the heavenly salted chocolate fondant and affogato) and rolled home content. Check it out! But book first as I tried for one night and couldn't get a table, so went the next evening. They open during the week at lunch and do pizza, panini and saladFull review with pictures here mylifeinsin.com/2014/01/\u2026",

    "text": "We went for dinner to Cicheti as a party of 4 adults. The table was reserved on Monday evening at 6.30pm for dinner at 7.30pm on the same night. On arriving at the restaurant, my mum and I reached first and were shown to a high table meant for 6 people. We requested for a table with low seating since my mum has pain in her knees, so is unable to climb/ step up and sit comfortably. This was the start of the rudeness by the manager. He flatly refused to even make any attempt to accommodate us on any other table, saying that the place was fully booked (we were seated at the 3rd occupied table on the lower floor where there were 3 more tables empty at the time). So we adjusted and ordered our meal since we wanted to have a peaceful dinner. Midway through the meal my mum switched to the extra (till them empty) seat since I had ordered prawns and the smell was too strong and bothered her (she is vegetarian, and not a fan of seafood smell). Back came the manager to tell her off !!! We told him that she would switch back to her seat if any other guests showed up. That wasn't good enough for him, so instead of creating a hue and cry my mum simply sat back on the original seat.This is when I requested the manager to have a chat with me and then started his racist rant against Indians :(Some quotes from our conversation - things actually said by the Cicheti Manager to me: \"There is always problems with Indians only, they agree on the phone and then want something different when they come\"\"I hate Indians\"\"There are many other Italian restaurants, why don't you go there\"We finished the food we had ordered till then, paid our bill, refused to pay the 10% service charge and left!We have lived in Singapore for nearly a decade now and also travelled extensively abroad. We have never faced such racist behaviour from people on the front line in the service industry. So appalled and disturbed by this experience that I felt compelled to share it in such great detail. I also saw that we are not the first to be spoken down to by the manager, there are some other reviews for the restaurant which say the same thing - the food is great, but the manager is awful and rude !",

    "text": "Came here for lunch with a friend who lives in the neighborhood. I had been craving wood oven pizza and she said recommended Cicheti. We ordered 2 pizzas - Bismark and Carbonara. The former is a favorite of other reviewers and the latter was recommended by the waitress. The Carbonara totally blew us away. We absolutely loved the caramelized onions that formed part of the topping and we soacked up all the egg yolk with our leftover crust. Perfection! We were sad that the pizzas got cold after awhile. We shared the salted chocolate cake for dessert. Fantastic choice!! I am a big fan of molten lava cakes in general and this one did not disappoint. The portion is quite big - perfect for 2 ladies to share. The melted chocolate oozed out once we dug in. There was just the right amount of salt added to boost the flavor, and the generous scoop of vanilla gelato accompanied with crumbles complemented it perfectly. Heaven in a mouthful! Only gripe is that the kitchen is small so once the place hits capacity service can potentially get slow. Hopefully they have more help for peak hours.",

I had both the uni pasta (a special, and not always on the menu) and the scallop and prawn capellini, and they were both excellent. The home-made capellini soaked in the saffron sauce completely, and it was a very well-balanced delicate sauce that I totally love. This place is good, and they have the hoards and hoards of patrons to prove it. Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "So close to a five-star review, so close. My finger hovered over the mouse clicker for what felt like an eternity before I clicked on four. I may yet change my mind... nah, probably not. Gotta be tough sometimes, know what I'm sayin'?Anyway, the food and potential of this place is straight up five stars. The pizza is fantastic, and most probably my new favourite pizza in Singapore beating out previous faves Extra Virgin and Limoncello. The pasta also is simply wonderful: proper al dente, hand-made especially for the restaurant (according to front-of-house) with a delicately put-together sauce (the pappardelle ragu in this case) and no scrimping on quality ingredients.Moreover the price point is really quite brilliant. Approx. $70 for two pastas and a pizza. I'm not saying it's a steal but given the trend of skyrocketing prices these days, it's pretty damn great. The pizzas themselves are under $20 which is already cheaper than the two previous favourites I mentioned.What let this place down are some details. Firstly, the pizza came out incredibly quickly and was lukewarm. I suspect it was prepared earlier for another patron. The fact that I still rate it so highly is a testament to its overall quality but the misstep still deserves mention.The other letdown was the service. It wasn't terrible. Front of house (a European chap) served us the entire time. He was affable and fairly attentive. But i walked in at 8pm hoping to secure a table and was told that none were available until 9pm. I saw several free, assumed they were booked, agreed to come back for 9 and requested a call should any table free up earlier.My request was rebuffed. I was told that the restaurant was \"short-staffed\" and that front of house simply did not have time to check his reservations. This is not good enough. Staff your restaurant properly. When I returned at ten to nine, sure enough, the same tables that were available earlier were still empty. Something tells me no one ever ended up taking them and I could have well eaten earlier. This lack of attention and care for your customer is disappointing.The moral of this story: book ahead at Cicheti and accept some arrogance - the place is clearly buzzy right now. But the quality of the food is well worth turning a blind eye to the flaws.",

The wood fired oven makes all the difference, and the crust comes out thin but not cracker-y, maintaining that chewiness and blistering I've been searching for in Singapore for a while. Toppings are minimal and classic. For SF-ers, most comparable to Delfina or Delarosa. The pastas are also very good because they are noticeably house-made, and whatever \"cicheti\" or small plates they have on special are a good bet. It's a small space so you're better off calling for a reservation and going during the week. Service is above average, with waiters keeping an eye on you, refilling wine glasses and sincerely in support of the menu items they recommend.",

It was a great night until he tried to \"chase\" us away by accusing us of drinking too slow; 2mins before his staff told us it's ok, we can take our time and asked nicely that we try to finish it in the next 30mins because they are closing (1st notification). Ravi told us shortly that we only have 5mins to leave (when we both had a full glass of wine) in the most abrasive attitude that I have ever encountered and invited us to leave a comment because he is the GM and co-owner of the restaurant. The food was not too bad to be fair but not good enough to want to come back to this arrogance. There are too many great options in Singapore to bother abt this place.",

    "text": "4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service.We came here for lunch quite early at 12.15pm. Ordered the burratina for starters and 3 pizzas (diavola, bismark and prosciutto) for four and everything was quite delicious. The burratina cheese was fresh, cuddled by some rucola and delicious sweet onion bulbs. All 3 pizzas were perfectly done though I personally preferred the diavola and bismark.Unfortunately what dragged our meal down was the service. Despite being one of the earlier tables, boy did the food take forever to appear. Our starter took at least 20 minutes to be served despite most of the ingredients being raw. Our first pizza arrived about 20 minutes after that and then we waited again for the last two.We had to keep asking the servers to top up our water (every other table seemed to have a bottle of water except ours), provide serving cutlery for every dish (we stated we were sharing the food), check on our food...it just became painful after awhile. I don't think I've ever dreaded going back to restaurant that serves good food but I actually am. I think the front of house staff did the best they could but perhaps some smarter managemenet is needed - provide a bucket of cutlery on each table and flasks of water, have someone help the pizza guy (there was one guy flipping pizzas and 2-3 in the back with waitresses occasionally stepping in) and perhaps trim the menu if it expedites the lunch service.",

The burratina was not available that day so we went with two starters which were the day specials. The grilled octopus was excellent and on point but the beef ravioli with burnt butter sauce was a disaster. The pasta was too thick and the filling was tasteless. For mains, we had a lamb ragout pappardelle and a squid ink pasta. The pappardelle was good, with the pasta having good consistency and bite. Unfortunately, the squid ink pasta (linguine) was also too thick and lent a strange texture to the otherwise well-executed sauce. Dessert (chocolate lava cake) was excellent. Service was so-so. May be back for the famed pizzas next time.",

    "text": "Among the best Italian food you can find in Singapore. My wife and I haven't had better. Last night was our second visit to Cicheti and it won't be our last.The positives: the food is terrific. My wife and I started with an Arugula and Pear Salad that had some roasted almonds, a balsamic glaze and a hint of goat cheese. Beautiful presentation...not the best tasting or best looking salad on the menu, but very good. We ordered a margarita with bufala mozzarella pizza as an appetizer...second time having this, terrific crust, a little under done but the mozzarella kills it, best pizza I've had in Singapore, hands down. I then ordered the paparedelle and lamb Raghu while my wife had the tagliatelle and squid ink pasta...both terrific, would have again, no questions asked.The negatives: they sat us right next to the door and they kept the door open. This is a problem because if you've been to Singapore before, it tends to be a little hot. I made the reservation 48 hours in advance, and they wouldn't move us away from the doorway, even though we were the first ones in the restaurant (1 star for service staff etiquette). Drinks/beer selection is ok...nothing special.Cicheti is great. The staff could use some polishing. Otherwise, love it and will be back",

We had chosen to dine at cicheti because she wanted to satisfy her craving of having squid ink pasta and google proved aforementioned restaurant to have one of the better squid ink dishes. Our family got the pulpo and burratina to share as appetizers. The pulpo was way too salty and over cooked - it was really tough. The burratina was 'weak,' for lack of a better word - it was hardly even creamy and more watery than anything. As our mains, we got 2 seafood stews (which tasted decent), a Bismark pizza and the tonnareli nero. My mom complained that the pizza was way overpriced since it came with such basic ingredients. And for the pasta, it was too salty for my sister's liking. She returned it back to the kitchen and the chefs willingly cooked up another portion for her - but it still came out salty the 2nd time around. Maybe the water used to boil the pasta was way over salted? Maybe the pasta itself was made too salty in the kitchen because it's supposedly homemade? I don't know...The kitchen kindly gave us a complimentary dessert (chocolate cake) to make up for all the problems so that was nice of them. But overall, it wasn't a very satisfying meal. We wouldn't come back.",

The ambience is warm, inviting yet casual. \u00a0We had Polpo, the grilled octopus tail as a starter and it tastes delicious. It is a special menu for the day, thus look out for it! We ordered the Margarita Bulfala as I see that many people have ordered and raved about it. I like the fact that is a stone fired oven pizza. It is also fun to watch the Chef making the dough and putting the pizza toppings. Lastly, we had the squid ink tagliatelle with crab meats. It is actually tomato sauce, not black squid ink sauce, just so you know what to expect. Service was good. Nothing to complain about. There is a good selection of red and white wine. No draught beer though. I will be back for sure!",

    "text": "Based on rave reviews about the brick-oven pizza, I finally got a chance to visit Cicheti. You should definitely call to make a reservation, which can get difficult if you're looking to come at a peak time on the weekends.I came with a friend and shared a Pollo (almond pesto chicken) Pizza as well as a Squid Ink pasta (with crab meat). Both dishes were excellent, well-portioned and a great combination for sharing. I would say that the only thing to make the dinner more excellent is if the Pizza had been hotter when it was served. I've been to restaurants where the brick oven pizza is so fresh that it hurts to hold it in my hand (ie: Alt Pizza at Suntec). For a party of 2 on a Friday night, the bill came out to just over $60 including 10% service charge and GST. Not bad, but considering how busy this place seems to get over the weekends, I think I still prefer to go to Alt for my Pizza!",

This cosy spot has an unassuming shop front on Kandahar St and you could even pass by it if you're not looking for the shop number. Once you enter, you're transported into some (fancy) hole in the wall Italian spot with some legit offerings.I had the margherita bufala, and after looking at all the Yelp photos post-meal, I realised it's a very popular choice! As bufala mozzarella is a soft cheese, it did make the pizza slightly watery, but the tomato sauce and chewy, slightly charred crust made up for it. Not sure if I was just hungry or if it was just THAT good, but I was able to eat the entire pizza myself. I noticed other people were splitting their pies, haha.",

    "text": "Real food. Period. This is one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore, as told by many before me. They have a wood-fired oven that makes the pizza really authentic and just so fresh. Everything we've ordered was excellent. I'm a huge fan of those places where their integrity in food shows through from the bread they serve on the side -- they were so well-baked to be crips on the surface and textured just right on the inside. I've had the prawns (4/5) for appetizer -- again very fresh and loved the bread on the side. (good food just don't require much words.) Carbonara pizza (5/5)--excellent, excellent, excellent. I definitely would agree that pizzas are Cicheti's greatest strength. Despite the misconception that carbonara is some creamy, alfredo-like saucy anything, this was an authentic carbonara creation with egg in the middle with caramelized onion that complemented the rich pizza so well. Gnocchi (3/5) on the other hand, was a bit dull. It was good, but not to the standard that was shown through with pizza and the appetizer. I really liked the ricotta bits that were dropped on gnocchi but that was about it. Nothing spectacular. Panna cotta (5/5) -- THE best I've had in Singapore. Generous portion of really well-made panna cottaChocolate fondant (2/5) -- disappointing. Just overly sweet without much sophistication. Would not recommend. Service was okay. I've been told that I wouldn't be able to grab a seat as a walk-in that easily. So I did make the reservation. However, they really need to work on the speed. I am not talking about the slowness in general (as I do understand that good food can take some time) but the interval at which they brought us our food just left us in a very awkward eating & stopping cycle that did not create a good meal experience.All in all, pizza was super impressive and I loved the restaurant. Will definitely be back.",

I've had the pleasure of trying the pizza, the clam pasta, as well as the prawn starter plate, and all the dishes exceeded my expectations. Absolutely delicious and the staff is friendly to boot. Unfortunately, this doesn't cut it as a 5 stars only because of the wait/reservation system. As one other reviewer noted, even when making a reservation, they basically say you have to be out of the restaurant by a certain time and make it a point to re-emphasize the fact while you're there. While this might be a cultural norm in Singapore, I find that incredibly off putting. It's like, hey, I'm a paying customer too. But I'll be back, because their pizza is bomb.com",

This is my second visit. \u00a0Last visit left a very good impression, esp. the pizza so we decided to venture back for some good crust which is such a rarity on this island before heading to the Projector for some german films. \u00a0We had the burratina and the bismark and they were as good as I remember - the burratina was fresh, and I'm not just talking about the cheese but the arugula as well which is such a pleasant surprise. \u00a0There were too many times when I had not-so-fresh salads here. \u00a0The other thing I find restaurants tend to do here is being too generous with the dressing or perhaps it's reflective of local preference but I definitely prefer my salad fresh and with just a tinge of olive oil and/or vinegar, which Cicheti has executed perfectly. \u00a0The figs were delightful as i love the fruit and adds some interesting texture and flavor. \u00a0Now the pizza came fresh from the oven and I still love the crust - right thickness, right amount of chewiness. \u00a0I will definitely recommend this place if you are looking for some authentic pizza.The place seems quite busy and we were lucky getting a seat walking in. \u00a0We sat at the patio, which I didn't know about. \u00a0It's a fairly small area with three small high tables but quite atmospheric sitting in the open air and munching the dough while listening to the call to prayer. \u00a0Service was friendly and efficient. \u00a0Also just a stone-throw from all the action around hajilane or if you like movies, the projector across beach road. \u00a0Perfect starting point to a good night out.",

    "text": "Some restaurants deserve reviews, and others like Cicheti deserve love letters. Cicheti is my new favorite pizza in Singapore. They impress me, which is hard to do given my probably unreasonably high standards for pizza. We have gone here once a week for the past month. Here's why:The mozzarella was fresh and perfect on both the salad and the pizza. The vegetables were all fresh. The char on the crust was there but not excessive. The Cioppino has so much seafood in it that I wonder how they can make a profit off of it. The tagliatelle carne is probably better than you would get in most restaurants in Rome. The gelato is very flavorful and the polenta cake pairs well with it.The only somewhat reasonable competition I know of in terms of Napoli-style (i.e. the best style) pizza is Operetta. I think Cicheti has a better ambiance than Operetta. While the quality of the ingredients are probably equivalent, Cicheti has better execution. The toppings were more evenly spread out on the pizza. The salad was also slightly larger. Cicheti is also cheaper than most other pizza places in Singapore, in part because they don't charge GST (yet?). It's a weird feeling to come here and get a salad, a pizza, a pasta, and the Cioppino for 90 SGD total. Comparing that to Operetta, which is nonetheless a great restaurant, it's like getting one of those dishes for free.If I were to think of anything to dock points for, it would be that their upstairs seating area is so cold that it gives me a headache. Lately we have been calling and asking to sit downstairs or outside and they have been accommodating.All-in-all, this is a rare Italian restaurant in Singapore that doesn't seem like mostly a cash-grab. They seem to care about the details, making great food with authentic ingredients, and making people happy.",

Could not get same day reservations for Thursday but secured a reservation for a Saturday night. Cicheti is located near Arab Street and parking can be a challenge.Since we were driving, arrived early to find parking on the street. Bought parking passes at 7-11. There is a covered parking over at Landmark Hotel if you cannot find parking on the street. The restaurant is a rustic but sophisticated dining room that has both upstairs and downstairs seating. Enjoyed dining downstairs much better since that's where all the cooking and action takes place. Plus it had a cool vibe to it. Music was cool as well...kind of a Buddha Bar Euro sound.Uncomfortable Seating alert! I am kind of a skinny minnie (it's \"all about the bass\" they say) so I don't have a bass for the stool I sat on. It hurt my rear really bad. Bring a pillow to sit on if you are here more than an hour. Service was terrific. Our waiter was really welcoming and very helpful. Our water glasses were always full. To start, ordered the pumpkin salad. It was excellent. Pumpkin was perfectly seared and greens were fresh, fresh, fresh!Next was the spaghetti with New Zealand clams. Sad to say, that dish was a thumbs down. Clams were just too sandy. Would never order this dish again.Of course, the star of the show, and the reason we were here, was the wood fire pizza. . We ordered the Bismark...And it was brilliant! I will definitely will return for the pizza for sure. Oh, and I will bring a pad to sit on. Those chairs are the worst..",
