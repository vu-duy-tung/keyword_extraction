    "text": "This restaurant is located near the top of UOB towers in downtown Singapore. The windows provide a wide view of the water and surrounding business and tourist areas.The tea is served traditional style. A runner carrying a pot with a very long spout (a few feet long) fires a high-speed blast of tea into your tiny cup as he makes rounds through the dining room. All of the food we tried was excellent. The roast duck is prepared publicly in a spectacle. You can get it done any two ways you like. The wraps were the best part. Another excellent dish was the spicy chicken (sort of a kung pao style dish). It was very rich and sweet with every bite delivering a sensation. In fact, you may want to share a smaller portion between several people, since it can become too much after a while. The service started to lapse a bit once the dining room filled up. They need a few more people on hand, especially for a fancy place like this. Overall, this is a great choice for a special occasion like an anniversary, birthday, or special visitor.",

    "text": "who would have expected a Si Chuan restaurant to incorporate our local claypot rice to its menu?  Speaking of claypot rice, the most irresistible flavour is none other than the Sliced Pork and Salted Fish version (). With the increase in prices of salted fish, it was a delight to find generous-sized salted fish in the pot of fluffy rice.Meanwhile there is also the Claypot Rice with Chicken, Live Frog and Enoki Mushroom (). \u00a0\"\"---Perhaps due to the cool and comfortable interiors, there was not much of the sizzling sounds or smoky scents of charred rice. Fortunately, I could gleefully scrape off an abundant amount of burnt rice at the base of each claypot and swirl in more dark soya sauce provided alongside. \u00a0If you are ordering other dishes, each claypot rice can feed about 2-3 mouths. \u00a0The highlight of the day was the \u00a0Barbequed Suckling pig $198, which was indeed a terrific dish. Prepared by Barbeque Chef Zheng Guang Liang, \u00a0the pig from Hebei China is grilled excellently to produce a crisp, burmished crackling skin and ladies can forget about scraping the fats off the skin. Meanwhile the meat, which was sliced and re-served for easy consumption, was neither too dry nor too greasy--a culinary feat that deserves a round of applause for the chef. Besides the new promotional dishes, regular items such as the Double-boiled Deer Tendon Soup with Deer Antler () $18/person is definitely worth ordering. Made with good quality ingredients and herbs such as cordyceps flowers that warms your body, it is a nourishing brew that is brimming with collagen. Jumping straight to desserts, What forged a deeper impression was the Deep-fried Yam coated with Soya Bean Crisps () $18. The yam was soft, with a crunchy exterior that triggers your sweet receptors but not too much. And the fact that it is made with soya bean gives us a very good excuse to enjoy this indulgent snack!The Claypot rice in assorted flavours are priced at $18 while the Barbequed Suckling Pig is available at $198. For now until 31 Dec 2013, UOB Cardmembers enjoy 50% off the second order of both items. Unless you are dining in huge groups, it would be unimaginable to have two suckling pigs at one go and thus the second order of roast suckling pig can be taken away or consumed on the next visit.Sounds quite like a good deal, isn't it?",

    "text": "I've had several business lunches at this restaurant \u00a0and I always find myself surprised. Whether it's food or the tea pouring acrobatics, I \u00a0feel like I'm in for something different (in a good way) at every visit. Admittedly, my experiences at the restaurant are colored by the fact that meetings are held in private rooms with assigned servers and I do not foot the bill.First, Sichuan Douhua has a tea dude who walks around with a kettle and a long spout, to pour tea in your cup in the most over the top way. If you have an inner child, it's pretty amusing to watch. The tea itself is pretty fragrant. Next, I like the dishes the rotating dishes on the multi-course lunches. For example, I once had a bowl of hot oil filled with dried chilli's placed in front of me and plate of thinly sliced raw pork. We were instructed to cook the pork in the hot oil and eat it straight. The pork was tender and infused with chilli and mala despite the seemingly simple cooking method. I've also had the sliced fish in hot peppers, which an authentic Sichuan dish though no where nearly as spicy as the ones I've had in Sichuan or Chongqing. The beancurd served here is also very soft and fresh, probably some of the best I've had. Finally, the house special dan dan mian done quite well with chewy, hand made noodles topped with mince meat and chives. The downside to this restaurant is that most other dishes are quite pedestrian. The siew mai and har gow served with the set lunch is supposedly a house specialty but it doesn't blow me away. The soups also lack the powerful depth you get at the great cantonese restaurants. Overall, I can't complain much about Sichuan Douhua as it serves its function as a business lunch venue, but I wouldn't necessarily come out specially to eat on non-work occasions.",

    "text": "Proper Sichuan food can be a bit daunting to a gweilo like me \u00a0for a start, knowing what to order, and secondly, dealing with the face-numbing power of Sichuan pepper. However, coming here is an admirable solution to both problems. The set menus are very good ( as part of a big business party, this was a smart move), and the location is stunning, up on the 60th floor of the UOB Plaza. If you can find your way up here, it's well worth a visit; I'd suggest the chili jellyfish, and anything with sichuan pepper and tofu, an intriguing mix. The waitress will warn you, if foreign, to refrain from laughing, , speaking, or coughing while takling some of the hotter dishes; she's quite serious, and you wouldn't want any going down the wrong way, as I'd imagine it akin to a deep breath of CS gas. Traditional green tea is served from long-handled pots ( handing for reaching across the table), and is very welcome for putting out any oral fires. Very highly recommended.",

    "text": "This review is a little dated, almost 2 years ago, so I hope the standards are still as awesome as they used to be! This place is especially fantastic if you made reservations way in advance. When visiting, a local friend did that and we were able to get a spectacular 60+ floor view of the entire Singapore river night skyline, as we arrived in time for sunset to see the lights of the city come on. The view was excellent, but we also had a great time sampling all the local delights, as we opted for the a la carte buffet that had about a hundred dishes we could select from (minimum of 4 people). Most memorable was the Chong Qing chicken, which was super super spicy and we had to drown ourselves in water after that. The fish was good, we loved the coffee pork ribs, the noodles and there was a great selection of 8-10 types of Chinese desserts to choose from, which we really liked. I think the almond dessert was particularly refreshing, after all the heavy meats and oily food. Highly memorable was the tea master who walks around and pours tea using a long sprout, from almost 3 feet away. I think it was called \"Kung fu\" tea. We were highly entertained all night watching him and we would come back in a heartbeat next when we visit!",
