Definitely a must for special occasion.We had the afternoon tea since we arrived right at 2PM and their kitchen had closed for lunch. Afternoon tea was $30++ which I thought was neither cheap nor expensive. The small bites + coffee/tea weren't anything exceptional. I wouldn't highly recommend them since I believe there are other places with better afternoon tea selection. Go here for the view!",

    "text": "I'm very particular about food and it's rare to find such a superb restaurant around these parts! We visited for their Sunday Brunch menu which at $40++ per head including juice and tea/coffee, is very much value for money. The menu only has a few options to choose from, and then you can pick two sides from the list to go with it. When our food arrived, it looked and tasted divine. I went for the eggs benedict with the smoked salmon gravlax, served with spinach on a couple of their own made crumpets. I chose the wagyu sausage and the pear and blue cheese salad for my sides. I would recommend everything that was on my plate, especially the wagyu sausage! The staff are very friendly and host a very relaxing atmosphere. We arrived slightly early and walked around ION Sky. I would highly recommend doing this as the views of Singapore and beyond are fab. If you are unfamiliar with your surroundings, there are signs showing what is where. The only downside, one which I found a little cheeky, is that if you wish to have a window table, then you must pay an additional $20 for the privilege. I had booked a table for 11am and although the restaurant was pretty much empty, we were sat in the centre of the room. The views are still fab though! I would definitely return if I ever have the opportunity.",

    "text": "The location, view and decor was top class! The service and staff was quite good and the general atmosphere very pleasant. However, you walk through a shopping mall going in and again coming out which somehow lessens the experience (in my opinion) and leads me to wonder why the architects would not have considered having the lift run all the way to the ground floor instead. This is for sure not the fault of the restaurant. Nonetheless, the food, while being good, is somewhat overpriced. For 70+ sgd \u00a0for a steak there is an expectation that is not quite matched. Especially as the entrees are not served with much else, and each side dish at 10+ sgd, the costs run high quickly. Having said that the presentation is great as is the wine selection, the amuses bouches and the drinks.I would absolutely recommend this place to have a drink, some appetizers and enjoy the view, but for a great steak, I would go elsewhere for value-money.",

Beautiful space, elegant decore, romantic lighting make it a great choice for our first date night in Singapore. When booking I mentioned the occasion and requested window table which we were given though all tables have a skyline view.. We started with a bottle of Mum, the 'glass' crab omelette and the foie gras. The fluffy, delicate omelette was served in a broth that was packed full of flavour. Foie gras became one of my favourite dishes when I visited Budapest. I order it at nearly every opportunity.This version did not disappoint but the plate itself didn't really flow. The perfectly cooked scallop seemed a bit extraneous.It basically went straight downhill from there. Our mains (snapper and kingfish) were fine but both over cooked. Dessert was ok, Coffees were outrageously overpriced. Service started off acceptable and dropped exponentially over the evening.",

Located right on top of ION Orchard, the restaurant gives you a fantastic visual treat of the city, whether night or day.The food is supposedly \"Modern Australian\", but you don't have to care what it's called, just know that it's marvellously good. All the ingredients are fresh, the dishes unique and the presentation impeccable.And no wonder: it's opened by celebrity chef Luke Mangan and there are only seven of such restaurants worldwide (although one of his proteges have taken over the running of the Singapore branch). I had the Maori Lakes beef tenderloin, which is so good my vocabulary fails me. The Barramundi fillet is also fantastic, but not everybody will like the sauce it comes in. And if you love sashimi, you have to try their version!For dessert, you must try the chocolate mousse. You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't!I'll definitely come back the next time my wallet feels thick enough.",

    "text": "Confronted by the capturing city skyline, I grew vulnerable at an instant. The breathtaking environ is uncontested, it is no wonder that others called it a romantic spot - I wouldn't refuse such claim. I often get bewitched by the apparent horizon at BLU, I have thought that was the most friendly distance with the clouds until the restaurant was shut last June. While seeing people displaying their portraits taken against the limitless blue plane on various social media platforms, I have secretly bookmarked the place even when there's nothing much to brag about on the food.Located on the 56th floor at the iconic Ion shopping mall, one has to make his way to level 4 where he will be greeted by a Salt representative at the concierge counter before being transported to the restaurant in a private lift. Clad in stylish layout, pressed table cloth draping the well-aligned tables that sits under the tall ceiling, the space looks so accommodating. The sky bar adjoins Ion's observatory deck will open at dinner time, sets the mood for some romantic engagement. Even if you don't get to sit at the bar during the day, you could walk to the observatory deck for a 360degree view of the city landscape before getting yourself chained to the seat. The service staff are polite and sensitive to your needs. Undeniably knowledgeable on the food composite when I throw questions at her except a fair-skinned white macho who expressed disapproving frown when was told that the asparagus tasted weak under the strong blower in the restaurant.I was nonetheless impressed with the Fig Tart but less with the crab omelette that many raved about. The brutal kind of tart that you must have, absolutely regrettable if you missed. Get ready to be charmed by that utmost thin and flaky puff pastry - resembles someone with bloated tummy, it was filled with airy compartments packed with overlapping pastry layers that was buttery and so brittle. The sweetness in the fig plus the caramelised onion adds sharp flavour to the puff, together with a smack drizzle of acidic verjuice. I liked the fact that they have been less generous with the blue cheese stuck between the figs and softened onions which may otherwise oust the celestial fit in the dish.Most people will look for a robust egg dish that is almost always moist, tender yet with a sturdy structure. The Sydney crab omelette met the minimum - not overly cooked (though it could be better if it had been custardy) to hold up the hearty crab filling but taste flat. The spotless golden-yellow structure centred with simple embellishments was seen mediating in the miso broth with a zen outlook.I chose the asparagus with confit eschallot. I couldn't stressed this much that it looked as if it was a cold dish to me. Others might find the dish positive but it seems less conclusive for me. The crunchy stems were cold and although the shallot confit adds slight flavour, I leave the dish unconsidered.For the mains, the char grilled corn fed baby chicken fared sumptuously. Endless enjoyment to bits!! Instead of rubbery skin, it turn out thin crisps, splotched by a wider char surface. I love its smokey flavour that scent the fork-tendered juicy meat. While I enjoyed the well-seasoned juvenile drumsticks, I am more fond of the moisture trapped within the succulent meat space! And if you have not eaten a cauliflower puree, this is the time. The whitish pool of creamy cooked texture was laced with some lemon notes which brings out its dedicate flavour. With less added dairy, the puree retained its light fresher taste.Guaranteeing the best beef from the Northwest of Tasmania, Australia; the Cape Grim has a pronounced wild taste in the meat. Claiming the Australia's finest hormone and GMO-free grass fed beef, it has been well sought after by top chefs world-widely. Going for medium rare preparation, the brownish exterior charred by flat iron encasing the pinkish marbled meat was somewhat appealing. The crust hasn't had the satisfactory bite but the meat texture was tender with a bit of chew. Smudge each piece in the tangy yet pungent verde sauce with tons of flavours coming from chopped parsley, basil, capers and garlic, for very acute taste. The greatest letdown was the Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 which arrived with sheer dampness that I can't live in contention. Yes, it was baked airy in a milder chocolate note but it was all WATERY in the centre, and right to the base!! It seems like alien to me and so I have to summon my genuine feedback when someone came forward to clear my table. Chocolate Three Ways; the chocolate fondant cake has graced the dessert moment with lingering deep bitter flavour emitting from the moist cocoa sponge. The sweet-toothed wouldn't fancy this but they may find the milk Mars bar a bit more attractive. These desserts didn't quite complete my meal, less memorable. So, if I were to encode anything from Salt, it has to be the splendid horizon plus the entr\u00e9e.",

Meat special (158$ for 2) tasted like a low grade steak from a supermarket. And the dessert? Molten chocolate cake was neither molten nor chocolate.

But it will probably only take you 2-3 drinks to get to this amount since cocktails will run around $25 a drink.Views are great though.",

    "text": "The obvious wow factor for this place is the sweeping view. We went to dinner and had unfettered view of the Singapore skyline - that was remarkable. The food is generally good, with some misses. We did not care about the crab omelette that came highly recommended. But the Bungalow pork and octopus were both great starters. For mains, the sirloin was overly crusted but was good. Grilled asparagus on the side was also very good. I would rate the food a solid 3.5-stars but pushed it up to four for the excellent wine recommendation. Service here is strange. The disposition of the staff is wonderful. They are all friendly without being patronising. But there were service lapses. For example, we ordered three starters. Two were served together, then there was a 45-minute wait before the third one arrived. Worth a visit!",

So when the fianc\u00e9 brought me here for my birthday, I was really excited. They do have a wide array of cuts, and I loved that they brought over a giant platter and explained which cut was served for each dish. It made it easier to chose. Their meat was pretty good, though mine was a little over (asked for rare, but it was closer to medium rare/medium). Their red wine sauce was really good though! Francis and I were a little over ambitious and thought we could finish a side of asparagus, oyster mushrooms, and onsen egg, but we couldn't. This side dish did taste a little strange though, still can't figure out why I didn't like it that much. Dessert was average, the chocolate lava cake was slightly over baked so it didn't ooze out nicely. I wouldn't say I'm super disappointed, but I'd probably only go back there for the meat and the view.",

The Afternoon Tea Platter costs $38++ per person, inclusive of a tea or coffee, or $53++ per person including a glass of G.H Mumm Champagne. It is available from 2.30pm to 4:45pm. The coffee is non refillable, while as for tea one could ask for refillable of hot water.The afternoon tea platter consisted of Crostini, avocado, cherry tomato, olive,Ham & turkey, beetroot, manchego, tortilla,Smoked salmon, cucumber, chive, cr\u00e8me cheese on rye,Chocolate & jam lamington,Coffee macaroon,Tim tam chocolate tart,Red velvet cup cake,Anzac biscuit,Citrus marshmallow, andScones.The tea set was nicely plated but I felt that it was a bit too overpriced for such little food. May I was expecting much more from this price. The Citrus marshmallow is my favourite as it had a rather zesty taste which peaked one up. The rest were not bad too.I had requested for a table by the window through online reservation, but was showed to a table by the frosted window with no view of the outside. Not sure if it was due to the fact that I was having a 3 years old boy with me at the time. We were seated far away from other customers and had difficulties getting the attention of the staff. As it was between lunch and dinner meal times, there was limited choices for a 3 years old. No children menu, so ended up ordering French fries ($11++) for him. Total bill for the fries was $12.95.",

    "text": "Wow. a totally unexpected surprise. We've been meaning to check this place out for awhile bc of its great view from the 50th+ storey of Ion Orchard, but kept postponing our visit bc we were told from friends that the food is not worth it. You are basically paying for the view, they'd say. But we decided to finally try it out on a random Sunday lunch, and ultimately and surprisingly had one of the most satisfying dining experience in Sing. 1. The service was perfect. From the moment we walked in, we were pleasantly greeted and escorted to one of the many seats next to the windows for the perfect view and we were able to see our condo from our seat! the kind and attentive waiter really knew his menu and was always readily available. 3. The lunch set menu was so much cheaper than we expected, at $49 for 3 courses including tea or coffee. what a bargain, considering the location and the fact that the dishes mimicked that of dishes at fine dining, or were even better. 4. the dishes were so delicious! to start, they gave us complimentary radish snack with homemade potato chips.for Entree, we got:-'Glass' Sydney crab omelette in miso mustard broth, their signature dish which was okay for me, but D loved it. -Baked bone marrow, onion, watercress, and garlic toast. \u00a0 this is the entree to get. bone marrow was the best I've tried in a long time! It was prepared in such a way that I've never tried before, drenched in garlic and other sauces, and it was just perfection with the garlic toast pairing.Main course:-Seared Blue Fin tuna, potato, pimento, softquail egg, olives & anchovies dressing: \u00a0never thought i'd write a comment on an egg, but i've never tried an egg that was cooked So perfectly that it's bouncy yet so soft. \u00a0tuna and all the ingredients came together so well.-Goats cheese gnocchi, beets, vincotto, burnt butter dressing, pistachio, raisons: again, the ingredients in the dish came together so well, that we were forking everything together in one-bite to experience the bursting of flavors. it was perfect. dessert:we got the sorbet, crumbs and berries and dessert of the day which was a winner. We exited the restaurant as if we paid over $200 for the service, location, and the amazing food, when it was around $110 altogether. Why didn't we come sooner? it's a perfect place for dates, girl dates, and for visitors as well!",

Restaurant uses #coravin to serve their wine, which helps preserves the wine within the bottle without opening it #genius even the bread \u00a0served was fragrant & went well with the olive oil & smashed nuts. Before serving the starters, the waitress, Eve, took out a crumber/crumb scoop/crumb picker... whatever you call it, & cleared the bread crumbs from the table with amazing efficiency! The starters continued to impress our taste buds as the shrimp sauce blended nicely with the scallop to deliver a fresh, yet full flavor. It was so good that we wiped it off our plates in the blink of an eye \u00a0mains came shortly after, & I must say that the pace at which the food was served wasn't too fast, & not too slow, which helped create a great transition between the dishes. Barramundi with prawn \u00a0tempura for me, & medium tenderloin for Serena. The full dish name was too long & I didn't note it down. The food quality's simply world-class, & I'd love to come back again for special occasions \u00a0& only for that, cuz the price was more to the steep end!",

    "text": "My husband and I recently celebrated my birthday here, and I had a wonderful time! (I say \"I\" because I stuck him with the bill at the end of the night!)Salt Grill is an awesome place for a special occasion dinner, and I also agree with the other reviewers who say it's a good venue for treating out your parental units.To get there, head to the concierge at the 4th floor of Ion. Walk around the desk and you'll see the welcome area for Salt. Someone will guide you to the special elevator bank that will whisk you up to the 55th floor.Walking into the main dining room, your breath will be taken away by the lovely views of Singapore. I'm glad we went here for dinner because I enjoyed watching the city light up and transition from early evening to dusk.To start, we ordered the oysters (served natural), and the 'glass' Sydney crab omelette. I can't comment on the oysters as I'm allergic, but I will say the Sydney crab omelette was a-ok. I know people rave about it, but it's simply not my type of dish.However, I really loved our main. We did the meat cut for two, which changes daily. That day, it was a bone-in ribeye. It came with onion rings, a rocket salad, and mash. Miguel doesn't like potatoes much, so we asked if we could replace the mash with the roast garlic mushrooms and luckily they obliged.The rocket salad was my type of salad: blue cheese, pear, and candied walnuts. All so good! The steak was juicy and I loved the horseradish/pepper jus that it was drenched in. Throw in a decent bottle of wine (we decided on a cab sauv from California) and we were in heaven. For a moment, I was worried because the table next to us brought a baby with them... but thankfully the baby was quiet and didn't disturb our dinner. Overall, the ambiance was set nicely with the dim lighting and bossa nova soundtrack in the background. The service was impeccable and we didn't feel rushed at all throughout the evening. If you're feelin' spendy, this is a great option to consider. :)",

    "text": "If you want to score, this is the place to bring your wife or girlfriend! Salt Grill oozes with sex appeal. You enter the restaurant through a welcome area on the 4th floor of ION and through a special elevator bank behind the art gallery. Once you reach the top floor, you are greeted by a beautiful dining space and jaw dropping views of Singapore.Making a reservation is a must, especially if you want to secure a spot with one of the limited tables that line glass viewing area.Our order included: raw oysters, glass Sydney crab omelette, rocket salad, and bone-in ribeye steak for two. The glass Sydney Crab Omelette was a definite winner and is a must have appetizer. The Rocket Salad with blue cheese, pear and candied walnuts is a great choice for anyone in the mood for a refreshing salad.The clear highlight for me was without question the Bone-in Rib Eye. The steak was juicy, perfectly cooked, and mouth watering. However, I'm a fanatic of steaks that are juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside (Heston Blumenthal way of cooking steak). Don't get me wrong, Salt grill delivers a damn good steak, but I can't give it the \"best in Singapore\" designation. The restaurant was also nice enough to alter my sides from mash potatoes to roasted garlic mushrooms, free of charge.Overall, Salt is a wonderful restaurant and is among the very best in Singapore. 5 stars for the ambience and breathtaking views and 4 stars for the food.",

    "text": "Restaurant Week lunch. I have always wanted to try the food at Salt Grill & Sky Bar but it is always full during restaurant week, well, except for this week. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars: The experience was marred from the beginning when I saw the email on Tuesday (they sent it Sunday afternoon, but I didn't check email till Tuesday...some people are not chained by email :p) where it asked if I could change my dining time to 11.30 am or 11.45 am instead of 12 pm. The reason was due to the overwhelming response and so we will only have 1 hour 15 mins to dine if we come at 12 pm.The question that pop into my head was \"didn't they already have a fix number of tables for Restaurant Week\"? and \"Why was this not indicated when making the booking?\" And this was not the first time Salt has participated in Restaurant Week, wouldn't they have known better on what to expect?It is quite disconcerting to have to re-arrange our schedule just so we will not have a rushed lunch. In any case, we decided to change our reservations to 11.30 am. I got there just before 11.30 am and was told the restaurant was not ready as the staff are getting their briefing then. 2nd strike. I made the effort to be on time, and at the time suggested by the restaurant, I would expect to be granted the courtesy to be seated accordingly. Cooling my heels for a while, it was another 5-10 minutes later before I was finally shown to a table. The \"3rd\" not so happy experience was very minor - I asked for a window table but I was told it was for non-restaurant week customers...that reason did not fly with me as a friend had the window table the day before and she was also dining on Restaurant Week menu. Anyway, that was really a minor thing but the whole pre-dining experience was enough to make me put Salt on the \"first and last time\" dining list. Back to the place and food:I like the simplicity of the place with its high ceiling and modern furnishing. Service was professional, attentive, polite and not overly friendly. What caught me by surprise was the basket the manager brought over for us to put our bags. That was thoughtful. Water was topped up without having to ask (they do ask if you want still or sparkling water, but you could request for warm or iced tap water at no extra cost), the courses were well paced \u00a0so we did not feel rushed. In the end we left slightly after 1.15 pm, but never once were we made to feel we had to hurry through the meal. So kudos to the service staff for making the actual dining experience to be enjoyable after all.Restaurant Week Menu:Starter - chicken liver foie gras parfait, truffled butter, toasted brioche. This was really superb. A generous serving of smooth pate in a small jar which went very well with the brioche and complimentary bread Main - Maori lakes tenderloin, blue cheese pressed potato, spinach and red wine jus. I asked for medium and it was done just right, not too bloody with a bit of pink in the center. The meat was just so tender and juicy (still cannot compare to American beef in flavor) that it was with sadness when I popped in the last bite. I wished it was a bigger portion. Just have to come back next time for the 200 gm served in the ala carte menu. The pressed potato (in thin slices) with blue cheese was ok, just a hint of blue cheese so those who do not like it will not be turned off by it. Dessert - tasting platter Creme Brulee with salted caramel ice cream - my favorite of the lot. Creamy custard covered with the sugar glaze and topped with salted caramel ice cream. There were also chocolate pearls hidden giving it a nice crunch.Chocolate bar - surprisingly I did not find it that great. There were some wafer bits which tasted a bit soft, not crispy at all. Licorice ice cream with lime and sago - never a big fan of licorice though the lime did give it a bit of contrasting flavor and made it more palatable to me.Coffee was normal. You could select the tea of your choice, you just have to ask them what is available. So yes, I would want to go back again, just to have the tenderloin and for the view. It is a very nice view and will probably be fantastic to dine in the evening to see the sunset.NOTE: To get there, you need to turn right and right and left (when you see the TV) to get to the elevator to Salt Grill. It can get a tad confusing and dark to find.",

    "text": "I like to dine with the world under my feet and if you do too, then scoot over to the newly refreshed Salt Grill &amp; Sky Bar at ION Orchard which provides a magnificent landscape of the Orchard Road skyline with their full glass floor-to-ceiling windows that span two storeys high. Swanky it is, Salt grill &amp; Sky Bar serves up some Modern Australian cuisine by celebrity chef-restaurateur Luke Mangan and is known for its one-of-a-kind experience that begins even before guests enter the restaurant. Special concierge reception, private lift, exclusive dining area... it's hard not to feel special here.Modern Australian cuisine is an intersection of influences from cuisines around the world and i could taste that rightaway in the Amuse Bouche, Coconut broth with Sydney spice. Flavor-wise, it tasted very much like Thai Green Curry without the spice.We then proceeded with our wine and dine event and our dishes were paired with drinks from the Award Winning New World Wine List of the Year 2013 by the World Gourmet Summit. There is also the signature range of eponymous 'Luke Mangan' wines which are produced in one of Australia's leading wine estates - TarraWarra Estate in Yarra Valley, which Chef Mangan was personally involved in the selection of the grapes and the blending of the wines.Spring vegetables were served with the mild goats curd, ginger bread crumbs and dried black olives ($31). These are probably sous vide to seal in the freshness of spring.I love my eggs and the 'Glass' Sydney crab omelette ($33) totally won me over with the precious sheets of runny egg in the center, enoki mushroom and herb salad in miso mustard broth. A generous serving of sweet crab meat was wrapped in the golden parcel. This is certainly a light dish that is refreshing with a basil taste (again, this is almost Thai food). Signature starters include the Tea smoked quail ($31), an original creation in which the bird is smoked with a combination of earl grey tea and rice, and nicely paired with almond cream, prunes, truffled grains (i believe there is quinoa), grilled shallot, sorrel. There are so many dimensions and flavors to this dish and i was slowly savoring each component. I haven't had prunes in a dish for sometime and it went well with the smokey tender quail.For mains, we had the Sirloin Rangers Valley, New South Wales, 300 days grain fed Wagyu ($74). Moroccan spice, saut\u00e9 spinach, eggplant puree, red wine sauce \u00a0Wasabi, whole grain mustard. Fantastic aubergine spiced pur\u00e9e. Pick your cut from the meat board before having it grilled to your preference (only medium rare for me).Dessert was pleasantly surprising with Luke's liquorice parfait ($18). I don't quite like licorice but i was amazed at how interesting the flavor and texture worked together especially with lime. You gotta try it for yourself.",

    "text": "This is a review of a Friday evening dinner date at Salt grill and Sky bar.I have to admit the view is pretty spectacular. \u00a0Well, if you like urban skylines (I do), it is.I was late. \u00a0My date was even later. \u00a0The staff made no mention of this.The room is a very well appointed. \u00a0It is an impressive space with both modern and classic touches. \u00a0There is a large glass roof. \u00a0It truly hearkens to my expectations of traditional white-tablecloth fine-dining. \u00a0I was surprised that the restaurant was only halfway full. \u00a0It is a very quiet and restrained restaurant. \u00a0The staff even sings \"Happy Birthday\" in a barely audible tone.This continues to spill over into the service. \u00a0This is professional and polite. \u00a0It is reserved. \u00a0It is attentive. \u00a0There isn't any unnecessary chit-chat. The service was impeccable. \u00a0It was timely. \u00a0The staff was there when they should be. \u00a0The server was knowledgeable. \u00a0This is the very essence of fine dining service. \u00a0The meal was also well-paced.This was the first restaurant I've visited in Singapore that offered a complimentary glass of champagne to start the meal. \u00a0The food ranged from good to extremely good. \u00a0The presentation of each dish was another classic touch. \u00a0They were beautifully plated without giving into to being overly showy.Complimentary Bread - A very nice fresh bread was provided. \u00a0It was served with olive oil and a mixture of high quality salt to dip it in. \u00a0When she quickly answered no to \"would you like more bread\", my dinner companion saved me from my own appetite.tinyurl.com/c2wjy4nScallop raviolo in squid ink pasta, spiced tomato consomme, corn puree - I only had one bite of this. \u00a0It ended up squarely in front of my date. \u00a0It was very rich. \u00a0If they provided this as a main dish, I could easily order it. \u00a0For me, all of the ingredients worked well together. \u00a0I do not have a photo of this dish.Roasted cherry tomatoes, Burrata cheese, peppers, grilled bread - This was extremely good. \u00a0It came close to allowing the red peppers to dominate. \u00a0But the creaminess of the Burrata and the sweetness of the roasted tomatoes helped to keep them in check. \u00a0The bread was grilled perfectly to hold the dish together.tinyurl.com/akv3ufgDuck sliders, pickled spring onion, cucumber - These were very good. \u00a0If I had my choice, I would probably have selected a high quality Western style bun over the more Asian style presentation. \u00a0Excluding the \"bun\", the ingredients provided an almost bahn mi experience. \u00a0tinyurl.com/catdjllLamb cutlets Maori Lakes New Zealand, Provencal herbs - My friend ordered the lamb. \u00a0She was kind \u00a0enough to share a bite. \u00a0It was very good. \u00a0The balance of the flavour of the lamb was perfect for my own personal taste. \u00a0She seemed to enjoy it also.tinyurl.com/azdxbhoCorn fed Spatchcock, Cajun and herb spices - I am not quite sure what made this dish a spatchcock, a cooking term for removing the main two bones and cooking the chicken flat. \u00a0I am also not sure what made it cajun. \u00a0It was certainly too mild to be considered Cajun. \u00a0However, it was extremely good. \u00a0The chicken was moist and tender. \u00a0While not particularly Cajun, the spices came together very well. \u00a0In finer restaurants, I seldom order chicken. \u00a0I am glad I tried theirs. \u00a0It was some of the best chicken I've had in quite awhile.tinyurl.com/aou4p6qWe had sides of truffled mashed potato and roasted mushrooms. \u00a0Each of these were prepared in a very traditional manner. \u00a0They both served as comfortable compliments to our main dishes.Pear Torte - This was her selected dessert. \u00a0I tried it. \u00a0I would have preferred the pear to be a little softer. \u00a0Plus, the pear tasted more like an an apple to me. \u00a0But, it was a nice dessert.tinyurl.com/b2hamn8Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with salted caramel ice cream - This was not a traditional cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u00a0There was no hard carmelized layer to crack through. \u00a0For me, this dessert was more about the combination of ingredients with the ice cream as the anchor of the dish. \u00a0I thought it was a great way to end the meal.tinyurl.com/ag39gu9Receipt ($489.63)tinyurl.com/bys3jbkOverall, Salt grill + Sky bar offers exactly what I expect from a true fine-dining experience. \u00a0The room is beautiful. \u00a0The staff is professional and on-point. \u00a0The meal flows at a proper pace. \u00a0The food is consistently very good. \u00a0It also affords that added touch of a truly beautiful urban view. \u00a0Throughout writing this review, I mentally debated four stars or five stars. A part of me thought the food fell just slightly short. \u00a0Another part thought the enjoyment of the experience was slightly diminished by the fact the room was not nearly full. \u00a0In the end though, I do think this was a five star experience.",

    "text": "third restaurant week date in a row!for the uninitiated, you need to head to the 4th floor of ion, where the visitor's info booth is.their reception is co located there.they will then show you the way to a separate lift to the premises.they open at 6pm sharp, so even if you are early you cant get in.this is definitely a date impressing kind of place.the view reminds me of equinox and jaan.this is the most expensive of the restaurant week menu priced at $55.so in effect you are probably paying $20 for the view?the restaurant week set dinner is made up of 3 courses:for the first course, we had the 'glass' Sydney crab omelette, miso mustard broth.nice flavour from the crab as well as the mild miso mustard broth.lots of garnishing on top which can be a nightmare for some.for the main, the spatchcock is highly recommended.a juvenile chicken butterflied for faster cooking.it was very well seasoned and cooked to perfection.tender to the fork and juicy in the mouth.the grape and currant dressing gave the dish a sweet edge.the parsnip mash is also a nice change from the usual mash that we get.for dessert, you get a liquorice parfait in lime jus.can sound foul to some, including myself, who is not a fan of liquorice.but to my utter surprise, i was won over and really enjoyed it!the liquorice was used in moderation.and it was cleverly musked by the fresh lime juice, zest and lime fruit slices.you still get an after taste of liquorice but not a strong lingering one.pieces of thin biscuit wafer were delightfully crisp and buttery.the coffee that came with the set was sad!i guess i am comparing it to the one i had at latteria which was awesome.one sip and i abandoned ship.maybe it would be safer for you to go with their tea instead.if you would like wine to accompany your meal, they do have 2 special offer for restaurant week.however, we chose to go with the luke mangan's red and white wine by the glass in their ala carte menu.now for the ala carte orders:i started with the Fig tart with caramelized onion and blue cheese, verjuicedressing.the waiter duly reminded that it will take 12 mins to prepare this dish.must be really good then!:)it did not disappoint.the figs could be sweeter though.a thin pastry base topped with caramelized onions then round flat slices of fresh figs and finally some melted blue cheese and some sprouts.again the blue cheese may not go well with some, but i liked it.for mains, i had the Scotch 250g Rangers Valley VIC 300 days grain fed.grilled to medium and served on a bed of french beans with red wine jus.i had the english mustard and horse radish on the side.the beef was not spectacular.cooked as requested but only average in flavour.priced at $75, again you must be paying $20 for the view?we also ordered a side of Broccolini with confit eschallot.i must say they do their veg very well.not one strand was overcooked.all al dente.they could, however, be more generous with their confit eschallot though.service staff here are obviously all seasoned ones and very well drilled.japanese style efficiency in just in time precision.more hits than misses and if you are willing to pay more for the view and romantic ambience then you will be a fan too.",
