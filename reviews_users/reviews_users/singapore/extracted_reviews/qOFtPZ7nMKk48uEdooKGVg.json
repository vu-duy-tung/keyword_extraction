    "text": "To be honest, I'm not aware of Pompompurin till I saw its cafe launched in Singapore few months ago. Pompompurin comes from the Sanrio family which also feature Hello Kitty, My Melody & Little Twin Stars. Theme Cafe has always amazed me and as you know there isn't much Sanrio Theme Cafe here in Singapore and it sounds pretty fun to be involved in one.Looking at its menu, I feel like trying all as items was so attractive with cuteness overload by the Yellow Character. It's environment was featured in a theme of Garden City and everything looks peaceful and serene.Every table comes with a temporary \"friend\" to dine with - the Pompompurin plush. Do have some hugs to it and a photo session. Amazed by the cup of milk shake with printed Pompompurin Marshmallows topping off the gelatinous textured drink. The taste of refreshing fresh milk was really something I look upon to while the Mocktail of mango juice and fruits goes perfectly with cream and marshmallow in the fruity flavours.Puru Puru Pudding Shake - $12.99 & Fruity Garden Mango Juice - $11.99An adorable plate of slow-cooked mushroom stroganoff consisting deep flavours of scrambled eggs, onions and mushroom. Character Pompompurin was made up with yellow rice balls with meatball as its top and choclate fudge drawing out its eyes and nose, sitting on a bed of vegetables.Pompompuri's Mushroom Stroganoff - $17.99Like the Mushroom Straganoff dish, Pompompurin was made up by yellow rice balls but it was served in a cup instead. Pairing the rice with a little pot of stewed beef in delicious red wine sauce and sweet onions. Tasty and I like it.Red Wine Beef Stew - $17.99There are some desserts menu that exclusivelyy alloweed their customer to take-home a pompompurin sovenir mug. We have a lot of mugs at home and was not too tempted to have additional in the kitchen thus we had ordered the Mango Parfait without the mug. Served in a wobbly Purin with diced mangos \u00a0as well as little scoops of ice cream. Dig in your dessert spoon and check out the spongy cake at its base!Pompompurin's Mango Parfait - $19.99How do we resist cute stuff? It's so hard to do so. Having a Buddy meal that consist of 2 drinks, 2 mains and a dessert with $10 off the bill ends us up paying a bomb too as it cost about $90 in total after the discount. Drinks are considered expensive here and taste wise it is still ok.",

    "text": "Just A-Ok. To be honest, I don't know what Pompompurin is until a friend suggested we check this cafe located on the 4th floor of Orchard Central. We went there on a Wednesday afternoon (2pm) and greeted with a rather short queue. Waited for 10 mins and managed to get a table in this very \"happy wonderland\" that I almost wanted to make a U-turn and leave. The cafe is garden themed, with it;s signature bright yellow (rather too much, really), Pompompurin and friends figurines standing while greeting their fans. The side booth seating is reserved for bigger crowd, also comes with a Pompompurin cushion for you to cuddle (if you REALLY love that dog) and take selfie with - which I think rather unhygienic so please bathe him with Dettol first before you cuddle or sink your face in it. haha. We were seated in the middle and I requested the cushion just so that my photos turned out nicer. The friendly staff attended to my request and within minutes, I have the cute mascot sitting next to us, though he remained quiet and didn't participate in our conversation. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Moving on to the food - it's on the pricey side. Drinks - don't even mention it. A latte with 2 pathetic marshmallow cost $12.90 without GST. My friend ordered a \"Picnic Platter\" which consisit of a half bagel, a poached egg with hollandaise sauce sitting on a muffin and a stone hard scone. All for $24.90. Overall, we paid $60 for one main and 2 coffee. It;s just the novelty that you;re here for, I don't think I'll ever return. Oh, have i forgotten to best part? Occasional scream by little kids as entertainment.",

    "text": "This is a cute Sanrio theme cafe located at Orchard central level 4. Easiest way to locate it is to take the lift. I went on a Thursday evening (approx. 6pm) and there was a short queue. I was quickly ushered in, as those queueing were opting to wait for the booth seats. Upon ordering, the waitress warned us there would be a 30min waiting time,but actually we only waited about 10mins for the food to arrive. Anyway, while waiting, you can take photos with the cute centrepiece. We ordered the mango parfait, pancake stack, and coffee with marshmallows. The bill came up to about $70 with service charge and taxes. Quite pricey for 2 desserts and a coffee. Taste wise, everything was below average. The pancakes were cold and tough, like they were made in a microwave yesterday and left out in the open overnight to cool. \u00a0The mango parfait was alright I guess,and the coffee was very creamy, till you could barely still call it coffee. \u00a0Not anything you'd want to have again in your lifetime. +1 star for ambience+1 star for serviceScores zero for everything else",

    "text": "Full review with photos at nahmj.com/2016/06/07/pom\u2026Pompompurin is one of the many Sanrio cute characters. He is a Golden Retriever dog who loves to collect shoes, has a talent for napping and loves his mama's Caramel Pudding.The space of Pompompurin Cafe isn't huge. It is decorated like a garden with lots of traces of Pompompurin. The most attractive part of the cafe is at the centre of the cafe where Pompompurin and friends are at. There are 4 \"Tomodachi House\" (Friends House) with each a Pompompurin's friends; Bagel the Squirrel, Coconut the Monkey, Mint the Frog and Macaroon the Golden Retriever. These are found on the left of the cafe when facing from the cafe.It is interesting that the cafe serves desserts before the Main. I was quite shock when I saw my dessert order served first. It isn't a bad move, just unusual. We don't mind having Mains after desserts after all.We opted for the Spaghetti Napolitana ($26.99). This is one of the 3 dishes with the Pompompurin mug that diners could take home as souvenir. The tomato based pasta wasn't interesting at all. It tasted very normal with mainly pepperoni flavours. My Mom felt she could cook better than these.The second Main we got for sharing is the Pompompurin's Beef Stroganoff ($18.99). The rice is shaped into Pompompurin's head. This dish is more flavourful and tasty than our first. At the minimum, we could savour the beef flavour. In the gravy, there were extremely thin slices of beef and a beef patty shaped into Pompompurin's signature beret.We felt the desserts and drinks fare better than the Mains. My Mango Juice ($11.99) was filled with mango pieces and of course goodness. The only dessert we ordered is the Pompompurin's Mango Parfait ($18.99). We like the totality of the taste profile.After having the desserts, we thought it makes sense for Pompompurin Cafe to serve the diners desserts first since the desserts tasted better. It will leave a good first impression. LOL!Finally, there are more Pompompurin merchandise on sales. While making payment for your meal, do browse them and diners could make purchase for these lovely merchandise too.We felt the food at Pompompurin Cafe was extremely average and it is expensive. Our damage for the above was $91 which included GST and service charge.More reviews on nahmj.com",

    "text": "I heard about this cafe from a friend's fb visit. \u00a0As a still young at heart Sanrio fan, I've gotta try it and soak in the cuteness! \u00a0I came here with my children on a Monday around 11:30am, \u00a0there were no queue and waited a minute or two for a staff to greet and seat us. While the cafe was half full/empty, the staff asked if we wanted to share a table with a lady at the back. \u00a0I was puzzled by her request as I stared at all the empty tables around us. \u00a0Normally I wouldn't mind to share table, especially with children, if it means they could sit and eat quickly rather than wait for another 15-30 mins. \u00a0But with no queue and a half empty cafe?! \u00a0Anyways, we sat down, with no menus. \u00a0I situated the children and searched for a waitress. \u00a0I believe there were a total of three. \u00a0At random times, all of them are no where to be found, perhaps all of them are in the kitchen. \u00a0The service was prompt once you get a hold of the waitresses. \u00a0I ordered a cookie and cream caramel latte, a pancake tower, and a beef stroganoff. \u00a0The pancake tower came first. \u00a0While adorable looking, the pancakes were cold and tough. \u00a0Not the warm and fluffy pancakes that one look forward to devour. \u00a0The caramel latte, again, nice presentation, but the taste fall short. \u00a0It's basically a cold caramel flavored milk with whipped cream and one small piece of sugar cookie. \u00a0For $12, I'd expect a lot more. The beef stroganoff was tasty. \u00a0The sauce was rich but not overly salty. \u00a0The rice, again, looked cuter than its taste. \u00a0It was cold and dense. \u00a0I guess the kitchen staff needed to compact the rice into the pompompurin mold, hence the dense texture. \u00a0I could eat just the sauce with crunchy French bread. \u00a0Over all, it's a cute, yet pricey, cafe to take selfies and post of social medias. \u00a0Will I come again? Maybe just to soak in the cuteness. \u00a0Word of caution though, the cute pompompurin stuff animal got passed around so much, one is better off to just take picture without touching it for hygiene reasons.",
