    "text": "They serve excellent authentic italian food such as pizza, spaghetti, meats, soups and dessert.We ordered the minestrone soup - \u00a0the soup \u00a0was with a sweet tomato based and the vegetables were cubed and soft. Appetizers of Calamari which was lightly fried served with a tangy tartar sauce. The pizza are those Italian thin crust type that is freshly prepared with a good amount of toppings. Service was good as there was like only four other tables. Only bad thing was they stopped serving fresh warm bread with garlic olive oil, and drinking water since last year.",

This place is nice and they have a Arsenal Pub.I'm busy snapping photos and I love the waterfall surrounded by the glass panel. Nice and relaxing place to have lunch. As this is my first visit, my colleague ordered the food and as for me im busy eating. The pizza is simply delicious and the fried chicken wing. Oh Gosh, all the food seem so nice.",

The pasta gravy was absolutely delicious and I was also more than satisfied with the amount of clams. For the dessert, I had the tiramisu, which was excellent as well (although it was somewhat too sweet for me).Overall, I have had a very positive dining experience here and would highly recommend this restaurant.",

One part of the restaurant is actually a football pub and home to the official Arsenal Singapore Supporters Club. Being a die-hard Gooner (Arsenal Supporter), it is the closest thing to be actually there in London. Having been lucky enough to visit the actual stadia and the numerous Arsenal theme pubs in England, the atmosphere at Modesto's really feels the same. The walls are filled with Arsenal jerseys, scarves, flags, memorabilia, etc. With almost all Arsenal matches shown live and be among fellow Gooners. Modesto's the place to be for all Arsenal fans.",
