    "text": "Smack in the middle of the menu is The Beast burger. 2 pounds of beef. 1.5 pounds of pulled pork. A long list of other things. And really meant for 3-4 people. Who would think of such a thing!? WHO WOULD CREATE SUCH A MONSTER!?So menu craziness aside, the food here's pretty good. I can't comment on how authentic it is, since I ain't no southern boy, but tasty is tasty.The chicken fried steak is aiight, the batter's crisp, the sauce tasty, and the steak quality decent. The crab cakes are above average, though they're really just a starter (and are listed as such) so don't expect'em to fill you up. The chilli con carne is delicious. More meat dip than soup or stew, it comes with chips and has a solid zing, kick, and bang to it. The poutine... was disappointing. It's a HUGE portion considering it's listed as a side, I had no idea it was going to be that big, and frankly it wasn't that good. The cheese topping was weak, and there just wasn't much gravy. It needed MOAR GRAVY. IT NEEDED TO BE ALL BEASTY AND GRAVY-ED UP. But it wasn't. And it disappointed.Drinks wise there's a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge selection of bourbon. (Duh.) And they have your quintessential southern non-alcoholic beverage, some iced sweet tea. It wasn't that good as sweet teas go, but it just right saying \"I'll have some sweet tea\".  Anyway, I like The Beast. The food promises much and generally delivers, though the seats aren't the best because there aren't really tables inside (mostly high tables which I as a vertically less gifted person don't really like). Why only three stars though? I don't know. I liked it, but when I look back it was like the sum of its parts made it seem better than it really was. I was also with excellent company so I suspect that shades the whole thing better than it was.I shall have to go back and try more of their menu.Stay tuned, I'm going back in.",

    "text": "The bourbon selection is outstanding, Kentucky would be proud! For sure not the best southern food I have had, enough to to make my southern momma sad. No fried pickles or okra, One of my favorite dishes, fried chicken and waffles, was pretty bland and very greasy. Although the country boy burger had pimento cheese on it.. It tasted like it was cooked on a stove top. The music was great but the service was slow and apateticI'll comeback for the bourbon flights and will still be dreaming of Waffle House and Zaxbys.",

    "text": "Southern fried chicken in Singapore, sign me up! \u00a0I was pretty excited to try this place last night. \u00a0Jonesing for some authentic southern food I practically had drool drizzling down my chin when I heard about The Beast. \u00a0We sat outside where they use old wooden barrels as the tables and basic bar stools (no backs) for seats. \u00a0The place was pretty busy and they even had live music (one guy doing pretty decent covers of songs from the south). \u00a0When we arrived we could tell that the servers were in the weeds. \u00a0We had to seek out the hostess to be seated, found the menus ourselves, and eventually ordered our own drinks from the bar. \u00a0I think they only had 1 waitress for the entire downstairs while it looked like some of the kitchen staff would bring plates of food out. \u00a0The waitress seemed overwhelmed and it was hard to catch her attention because she never looked up or made eye contact, I think it was just too much for one well trained person to handle let alone a server who seemed very frazzled. \u00a0The drinks took a really long time at the bar. \u00a0I think if you have just one person making drinks they really need to learn how to hustle. \u00a0That being said, the drinks we did have were pretty darn good. \u00a0For the food, we of course tried the southern fried chicken. \u00a0The presentation was nice, served on a wooden board were breasts, wings, legs and thigh. \u00a0However, the chicken itself, while very moist, was also pretty greasy. \u00a0I personally don't like sweet fried chicken and I feel like this one might have had some honey or sugar in the batter. \u00a0There was also a spice that i didn't care for, kind of a curry or cumin thing going on. \u00a0I would have called it fusion fried chicken. \u00a0While not inedible or bad, it certainly did not satisfy my craving for authentic southern fried chicken. \u00a0We also sampled the buffalo wings. \u00a0Huge pieces of meat, so 5 stars for portion size, but the flavour was just kind of bleh and bland. \u00a0I think they are a fairly new restaurant so I would definitely give them a second chance. \u00a0Now that I know what to expect though, I wouldn't come on a busy night and I would try something else on their menu besides the fried chicken. \u00a0Oh yeah, I should really knock off an entire star for the biscuit! \u00a0I would actually label that as inedible. \u00a0The consistency of styrofoam and it immediately absorbed any drool I may have had when first walking in to the restaurant, figuratively and literally. \u00a0I think it might be time for a new recipe because they were super dry (authentic southern biscuits are fluffy pillow buttery bits of melt in your mouth deliciousness).",

Got the shrimp with grits which wasn't bad for SG standards. Bourbon menu looked comprehensive for fellow Yelpers who like bourbon. Don't order the pimento dip with chips bc it was $12 for all of 6 chips (!). They artfully assembled them into a mini tower but that didn't fool this NYer. Yes I counted them :)Dinner SGD90 for two: 1 app, 2 mains, 1 beer & 1 soda.",

    "text": "A Southern restaurant means classics such as fried chicken, BBQ, and Shrimp and Grits, all washed down with bourbon. \u00a0The Beast brings all of this to Singapore, and for the most part, succeeds. \u00a0The Beast has an extensive selection of bourbon and rye whiskeys, with some guests from Europe and Japan. \u00a0Prices are extremely reasonable with most shots at $16 or less. \u00a0I started with a Redemption Rye as an old fashioned, and later had a Willet's 8 yr old Family Reserve which packs a punch at 126 proof. \u00a0As for the food, we started off with some pork sliders which were just so so. \u00a0But the fried chicken was very good (save one small part that was a little bloody still) - crispy on the outside, while very moist and tender. \u00a0They also have a decent selection of American craft beers. \u00a0Overall, the Beast offers authentic food and delivers good value, although the service was spotty. Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "The Beast was decent for Singapore. Coming from the U.S. with Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles being the comparison, I was hoping for a little more. But keeping it in perspective, this place was pretty good. The chicken was large and full of flavor. The buttermilk waffles had a slight melt in your mouth sensation. The bourbon syrup was full of flavor and while I don't drink alcohol, the kick was nice for a minute. I asked for regular syrup (for my kids and to dilute my bourbon syrup). Speaking of, the place is not kid friendly, which if I had read the yelp info about the restaurant I would have known. There was live music, which is truly a southern thing but the speakers were loud. It was hard to hear even with people next to me. We sat outside and while there were a few no smoking signs posted on the outer walls, the party next to us smoked. The employees said nothing but with kids there, I would have preferred sitting inside or away from the smokers (but again not a kid place). The employees were friendly although one was a space cadet. She seemed timid and lost at times but tried hard to make up for her oops moments. She was young and probably new. Nice girl, nonetheless. My husband and I will go back sans children and see if we enjoy it more or the same. Also, I'd give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 if hat was an option, but it deserves higher than a 3.",

Moving to Singapore a few months ago, I have been on the search for that homey down South soul food and I have definitely found it at the Beast! This place is amazing- not only is the d\u00e9cor super cool and unique, the food is amazing and spot on delicious. I have been a few times now and haven't had any issues with food or service- the staff have always been very nice and attentive, making sure to check back often if we needed anything. So far I've had quite a few things on the menu including the bacon mac and cheese, cornbread, maple bacon donut, chicken and waffles, pulled pork sliders, and big biscuit. Everything was really good- I really can't pick a favorite! What I liked the most was that they made everything in-house, down to the maple syrup and bourbon. Also the food is made to order so it's fresh and hot when served. It's also a great place to bring friends- they have a full service bar and also live music on the weekends too. I recently took some friends who were visiting from Georgia and they were really impressed with the food and felt like they were back in the South! This has become one of my go-to spots. Definitely check this place out- great food for great value!",

I must confess I got lost after a while as some dishes seemed a bit similar, especially those with biscuits. But what I had and remembered was pretty good. I do love the mac and cheese burger. The mac and cheese was beautifully done with just the right amount of cheese to hold the macaroni together to make it as the \"bun\". The chicken and waffle was unfortunately, quite forgettable. I did like the bourbon maple butter sauce though. I liked the hash brown in the duck hash, and the steak was decent in the steak and egg though it did not look that pretty. Pulled pork hash and Dutch baby pancakes were equally yummy. The service was pretty awesome and very accommodating. We were a noisy bunch on the 2nd level which was thankfully powered with strong air conditioning. It was quite warm on the ground level. Washrooms are also on the ground floor. I will be back for more mac and cheese burger, and I will not be sharing that next time! Well, maybe with just one person but not a big group. It was that good to me.",

So don't expect to be seated in an air-conditioned cafe.The interior only has bar top seating.Here's their sunday brunch menu.1. Bacon Maple Donut $5I was really looking forward to this, even though this sounded so sinful. It arrived on a plate with strawberries, which were quite sour. The bacon on the top, being drenched in maple syrup tasted like bak kwa. I quite liked it. But as you bite into the donut, this is where the disappointment hits you.It felt like I was biting into a very hard piece of cardboard. It was so hard, this donut was fried for too long and it just wasn't nice. This was quite saddening, as I had high hopes for this.2. Fried Chicken and Waffle $20Having tried other chicken and waffles offering in Singapore, everyone told me to try this one out as it was the most authentic? Having lived in the US for a few years. Nothing about this strikes me as authentic. Where's the coleslaw? Okay, at least the syrup is still here with the chicken! The waffle looked so pale, when it first arrived I had thought of asking them to heat it in the waffle iron longer? The waffle looked so white!The chicken was crispy and succulent. We had a choice between thigh and breast meat. We went for the thigh which was their more popular choice. The waffle was too light and airy, it felt like you were biting into air pocket. It was not crispy at all. Another total disappointment. This is by far the worst waffle I had every had.I felt like I had wasted my time coming here, there's way better options in Bukit Ho Swee and Dhoby Ghaut!",

Ask anyone who's walked into McD's and seen sweet tea on the menu or eaten at Waffle House.I lived for a number of years in ATL, and was here with a couple of friends (one of them hails from Atlanta) and the food passed the test. We went straight for the fried chicken, burgers and pork collar.The fried chicken and gravy is good. Moist on the inside, even the breast meat was tender. I found it a little too brown for my liking (perhaps due to the oil being too long in the fryer?) The gravy is also good without being salty. The biscuit was okay but not particularly fluffy. Waffle is crisp and not soggy. The burger patty is also done to your specifications (medium/medium-rare if you ask for it).For dessert, we had the pecan pie and the bacon waffle sundae. Both good, and pretty close to what you can get in Georgia. Overall, decently good by Singapore standards, but obviously not the best or most authentic when compared to Southern food in 'merica. They also have a good collection of hard-to-find American craft beers. I was looking for Stone IPA, but it was sold out that evening. Looking forward to try a couple of favorites next time.The only thing I didn't see was fried okra and fried green tomatoes. I thought I'd never ever find proper Southern fare here in Singapore. But here it is, and it's fairly good (though not 100% authentic). Paula Deen would be proud. This place is legit, and I'm coming back.",

I'm back here again I spend my Sunday afternoon dating fellow yelper Carolyn as we are both craving for the Mac Cheese Burger since the last YUBE I attended.The 1st time I visted we are seated at the level 2 of the restaurant and we order quite a big variety of food.This is my 2nd visit to The Beast, this restaurant was located at the corner near jalan klapa road which was near to the main road. This time we were seated at level 1 indoor. It's a little squeezy and there aren't much table maybe because they have outdoor seating too.The serving was fast and both of us order the same dish Mac Cheese Burger which is super cheesy and yummy. Once you cut it the cheese just ooze out. The Mac Cheese patties was near to a inch thick and it's accompanied by lettuce, tomato and a thick beef patty. The combination was so well for us. We paid $26.00 for it and I guess I'm cheese overloadThe place serve all day brunch and it seems that the dinner menu is awesome too. Thumps up for the good service by the crew.

Called the beast to make changes, sadly they did not took my reservation in the afternoon and ended up allocated us outdoor (given singapore's humid weather) instead due to overwhelming reservation. Food - chicken waffle. Chicken was so damn good, skin was crispy and meat was tender. but waffles is abit on the salty side, actually I was expecting something sweet on the waffle. But I think it's base on individual preference. Truffle fries and chicken wings were average. Beast Caesar salad can be improved coz it taste kinda meh.Environment - haven't tried their indoor. But outdoor is still quite doable with (live) music playing. As this is the \"dengue\" month, it's advisable to bring insect repellant along. Coz that's what I saw patron from the table beside us brought.Waitresses - although we are assign to sit outside, the service is still quite prompt. Manage to chat up with their friendly waitresses while they were clearing the plates. Price - a little bit pricey, $170 for 2pax.Overall, it's still worth a try.",

    "text": "We went to The Beast on a Friday night. It wasn't too crowded and the atmosphere was very conducive for winding down at the end of the week - the low lights, music and low chatter of the other guests lulling you into a calm state.We had the truffle fries, bacon mac n cheese, buffalo wings and fried chicken, along with some beer and lemonade. The truffle fries were average, I think - hot and crispy with a hint of truffle aroma that disappeared fairly quickly. I was more interested in the \u00a0mac n cheese. It was great, not the run of the mill type. The serving was small, but it was meant to be an appetiser anyway. There was a certain depth to the flavour of the cheese - either from the bacon or from adding some blue cheese into the sauce. Whatever it was, it kept me wanting more.The fried chicken was just that - fried chicken. It was not as greasy as those from fast food places, but the flavour was nothing unique. The gravy that came with it was nice though. I was quite disappointed with the buffalo wings. They were just fried chicken with hot sauce poured on top. Buffalo wings are supposed to be baked/roasted with the sauce, but I doubt this one was. There were clearly areas on the wings that were untouched by the sauce and the flavour hadn't permeated into the meat. It was also more sour than spicy, so I got tired of it pretty quickly. For those four dishes, two bottles of beer and a glass of lemonade, our bill came up to $100.10, fairly expensive, but expected of the restaurants in that area.All in all, I think The Beast is an average place for food, but if drinks and socialising are more important to you, it's a nice place to hang out at.",

    "text": "I've been dying to find a Southern meal in Singapore e.g. Chicken &amp; waffles or biscuits &amp; gravy for breakfast but nothing seemed to have met my expectations. Well, i finally checked out the new Sunday Brunch at The Beast. Southern comfort food say what! It's time to get started thinking about bacon maple glazed doughnuts and lotsa bourbon. For starters, make sure you order yourself some Cornbread ($6). I love this one! It's way better than Kenny Rogers corn muffin which sometimes has these really strange chewy corn kernels. Expect a nice brown crust with a fragrant corn perfume. Make sure you dip into the maple syrup. Chicken and Waffles ($20) cannot be missed as well. Ok mainly the Southern fried chicken cannot be missed. The waffles are an afterthought (it was bland and thin) but that massive juicy chicken steak was flavorful and addictive. I still can't get over how much fried chicken i ate. The bourbon maple butter sauce added that little alcoholic bitterness and light sweetness to the overall flavor.The Pulled Pork Hash ($18) features a 10 hour pulled pork with bbq sauce that wasn't too overpowering. BBQ sauce has got to be my least favorite sauce of all time but this was quite enjoyable. The poached egg gave the dish a nice yolky moisture which made it even tastier. I could imagine this dish being made into a sandwich a la momofuku style.Biscuits are a huge part of Soul food and so we had to have the Sausage Biscuit ($18). It came with buttermilk biscuit, sausage patty, truffled mushrooms, swiss cheese and a sunny side up. The sausage gravy was sinfully flavorful (you really don't wanna know how gravy is made), but the biscuit and sausage were on the bland side. On the whole, it was sufficiently tasty. Bacon Maple Glazed doughnut ($5) was of a lovely density and had a nice crispy shell. It may be a little oily, and it also had that hint of oily taste but it's such comfort food! I couldn't help taking a few more bites.Our other dessert was the Mississippi Mudpie ($14). Well it's just boring ice cream really. It's not that it isn't tasty, but we were too stuffed to tackle my preferred Bourbon Pecan Pie with fig and honey ice cream ($12).We had an awesome time at The Beast. Food is really the highlight here. But be warned, make sure you keep the entire day free because you wouldn't be able to get out of that food induced coma after the meal. The good news is that you only need one meal for the day. Heh.The booze that we had were less than adequate however. Skip the sangria for it was way too diluted for me. The Mimosa was ok but it was more OJ than white sparkling wine. But I guess it works out ok if you do the 1h free flow version.",

    "text": "This place has recently launched some beastly brunches for the voracious appetites.It seems like a battle half-won for the Chicken & Waffles ($20), a monstrous hunk of deep-fried thigh on waffles. The chicken is excellently crunchy and tender, but the golden batter was too salty and thus one can't help but chomp it down with the partially deflated waffles for a balanced flavour. As a hard truth, the chicken tasted best when doused with the bourbon maple butter sauce. The Pulled Pork Hash $18 may very well typify the savage character of a beast. Imagine strands of meat ferociously teared apart and tossed with cubed potatoes, red peppers and BBQ sauce. But this Beast seems timid at heart for the taste was uninspiring and dry. A little more simmering of the pork with apple cider vinegar and chilli pepper may awake the soul of the Beast. Like most authentic Southern sweets , the desserts here do not go easy on sugar. I appreciate the thick Oreo crust of the Mississippi Mudpie ($14) but this strength also became its weakest link when the pie layer is as stubborn as a rock.The Bacon Waffle Sundae ($12) could be misleading for it is NOT a SUNDAE. But this can be forgiven because it delivered more than just a usual ice cream-waffle dessert. Accompanied by gooey butterscotch sauce, crunchy pecan brittles and a monstrous ball of Honey & Fig Ice Cream, the waffle itself has already surpassed the pallid version we've had earlier due to its sturdier structure and a distinct buttery notes. The crispy candied bacon was a bonus. \u00a0But what I liked best was the bacon maple glazed donut ($5) which reminded me of a sticky sweet Bak Kwa bun that BreadTalk introduced years before or the \"Sweet Mother of Bacon\" from Artichoke. And it's actually a SIDE, not a DESSERT. Yes, petite in size but it may just be the wildest creature at the Beast.",

While it's not quite up to the gold standard of Roscoe's, I thought The Beast was excellent. We all ordered the chicken and waffles and added a side of Mac and cheese with bacon and some fries. The chicken was moist and the buttermilk batter quite tasty. The waffles were very good and the bourbon maple syrup was excellent. All in all, a pretty darn good taste of home. The only downside was the service was only so-so. We sat outside and they seemed to be more focussed on the guests inside and a party upstairs - we waited over 20 minutes for an ice tea refill (which never came and we eventually cancelled). \u00a0It took them almost 15 minutes to run my card after the bill got there. We weren't Ina rush so it wasn't a giant pain but was was not top notch customer care.The place is also a bar so is not really family friendly. Despite the no smoking signs, the table next to us was filled with smokers and this staff didn't seem to care (it was outside though). Pretty noisy and rowdy even for an early week day dinner. With that said,no will be back - the food made the trip worth it and I am anxious to try and great selection of bourbons!",

Its cozy though and had a guy from Michigan singing cover songs. \u00a0They have a nice menu of basically southern food and large selection of bourbon and whiskey. \u00a0Its a nice spot to grab a drink or chill for dinner. Its not fancy or pretentious.So the food. \u00a0The menu items are good. Its not a large menu but has a nice selection of plates to share and they were all pretty good. \u00a0The buffalo wings were spicy which I love, the soft shelled crab sliders were good but not my favorite, pulled pork sliders were great, fried mozzarella sticks were good but basically mozzarella sticks so not super exciting and the bacon mac and cheese was super creamy and delicious. \u00a0They have a number of mains which all looked good but there is one that catches your eye. \u00a0THE BEAST!! I've never seen a burger THIS big. I dont even know how to classify it because it defies all logic...1.6 lbs beef patty, 1 lbs of pulled pork, 1 lbs of southern fried chicken, cole slaw, lettuce, tomatoes and probably a goat somewhere in there. \u00a0Its all piled on top of \u00a0a 9 inch bun (everything is in inches and pounds-truly American). \u00a0The label states \"adequately feeds 2 stoners or 4 regular adults\". We shared it among 6 people with the appetizers. \u00a0It was more than enough. Apparently if one person finishes it in an hour you get it for free which is kind of like saying if you jump off a building you don't have to pay for the ride down. \u00a0 Attempt at you're own risk.",
