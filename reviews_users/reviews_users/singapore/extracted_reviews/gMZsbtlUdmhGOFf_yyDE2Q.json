Nevertheless, the food was exceptional and I would definitely want to come back to try breakfast, lunch, and afternoon tea.FOOD: (HIGHLY RECOMMEND)- SEAWEED & WASABI FRIES (Appetizer): The seasoning of the seaweed, pepper, and hints of wasabi make these fries (which are similarly shaped to Mcdonalds fries) seem so sophisticated and inventive. Definitely enjoyed thiss!! Portion wise it was very generous and easily made the three of us full.- HALIA CHILLI CRAB SPAGHETTI: One of their signature dishesss and it was absolutely delicious! At first I was worried that the sauce would be too heavy but it wasn't at all. And they certainly didn't skimp on the crab bits!!- HALIBUT EN PAPILLOTE: Another signature dish which I really enjoyed! My favorite was the buttery soup-like sauce the halibut, broccoli, and mushrooms were soaked in. It definitely helped add some flavor to the unseasoned halibut. The dish also is accompanied with aioli sauce for you to dip the halibut in!! As well as rice and cucumbers which seemed very japanesy like.*When you order two chili crab spaghetti, they give you two Singapore SlingsOverall, a really great experience. Not to mention, the service was really good and I really like the decor of the restaurant.",

    "text": "so disappointing. food, service and value were far below what should have been at such an iconic locationthere was no one dining there when we got there at 6:30pm. that should have been a warning. our waitress barely spoke english. if this was a hawker market food stall, sure, that's to be expected. but in the Raffles Hotel?!?! my colleague ordered a cosmopolitan drink which was one of their specialty drinks and she had no idea what we were talking about. we had to point to it on the menuclearly nothing was prepared to order. the apps came immediately and main courses a few minutes after. we both ordered the cheesy seafood dish (I don't remember the name). cheese and seafood is usually high-risk and this was no exception. no dessert, we both wanted to get out of there, but the price was way too high. with so many choices around Raffles Hotel, including Boat Quay which is just \u00a0few minute walk, I will never come here again",

    "text": "Very nicely done food. The chilli crab spaghetti is spicy and delicious. Even my picky mother approved. And it's a great lazy way to eat chilli crab. The fries with the truffle aoili and spicy mayo is good - we cleaned out the truffle aoili. I like the pulled duck salad concept with the cold soba but they could have had a lighter hand with the sesame oil seasoning. Their brunch menu had a lovely pancake which my friend's kid scarfed down. Service is fairly attentive and place is relatively kids' friendly",

The price is not as expensive as one would expect since its based at one of the most expensive hotels in Singapore. I had the pancakes which is definitely worth the deal. Portion was big and it was tasty. Will definitely return to try out the other dishes. Decent restaurant that offers good ambiance even for large groups both inside and outside of it.",

    "text": "The iconic Raffles Hotel has finally gotten itself a decent restaurant for brunch with The Halia coming under its roof. Afternoon tea at the Tiffin Room is one thing but ladies of leisure still need their morning coffee run and eggs of course! And what better place to do it than at the urban, casual-chic sister of the award winning restaurant. I much preferred the indoor space which has a bit more privacy as compared to the alfresco bar area. Plus the Singapore weather is not meant for dining outdoors, even with ceiling fans. Give me my ac please.Weekend brunch starts at 11am. The selection is extensive with both the Brunch Specials and the Main Menu available for the picking. I've been in quite a bread mood recently and the Assorted Bread & Pastries ($12) really appealed to the tummy. The croissant was delightful and i love that they serve clotted cream with the basket.The Pancake with bacon, maple butter, fresh strawberries & puree ($12) was one of my favorite dish. I always get overwhelmed after eating a piece of pancake but Halia's rendition had me going on and on. I like the slightly buttery batter which was fluffy and the thin flaky bacon was an interesting complement to the dish. If you're more the traditional English Breakfast sort, you'd do well with the Grilled breakfast with any style eggs ($23). What's interesting was the sweetened bacon which was thick and juicy. The scrambled eggs had this interesting layered texture and i like that it was runny but not too creamy. I'm getting hooked on buttery eggs. \u00a0I'm not so much of a fan of the White bean Iberico chorizo leek stew ($16) but if you like gumbo and the starchiness of such a stew for brunch, then this would be it. The stew was \u00a0rich and starchy with a tinge of sourness from the smoked chipotle sauce. The Celeriac \"Lasagna\" ($12) is an interesting signature with crunchy thin sheets of pasta. I thought i was munching on vegetables. This was accompanied with mushrooms, thyme, baby spinach, lemon and Madeira cream. Another signature is the Halia Chili Crab Spaghettini ($25). Piquant spicy finish that is typically Asian. The flavor of ginger was rather strong but it gave the dish a fresh note. I could also taste the sweetness of the crab meat. If only they would use a thicker pasta. The Sous Vide Baharat Chicken Leg ($28) was very tender and flavorful. It also had that smoky taste which was well complemented with the sweet butternut squash puree. I was intrigued by the crispy thin skin which had the texture of a baked potato skin. Served with a ginger, coriander and pepper salsa. I like how Halia caters to vegetarian eaters with their innovative dishes. The Mushroom, Lentil & Walnut Bake ($24) was absolutely delicious and even this meat eater was sold. It was nutty, cheesy, savory and sweet with the fennel seed cream and sun dried tomato. I would order this again.As you can tell, the Halia offers a wide variety for brunch and i found it quite perfect for group gatherings. Enjoy!",

    "text": "We went here for lunch which was really good. The 'lunch espress' serves a great wagyu salad, a delicious truffle-egg on toast, \u00e1nd a proper chocolate desert with coffee. ($25) other options are available, like soup and tagliatelle.My girlfriend had the fried squid which was to die for, really that alone is worth the visit. The signature chili crab spaghettini was nice and plenty.Most noticeable was the service! We were served by a lovely lady called Kengar, who advised us on the food, and kept making sure everything was satisfactory. We haven't been served this good anywhere in Singapore yet.So overall definitely a great place to visit!",

    "text": "Ok so this isn't going to be the sunshiny review everyone seems to give Halia. I want to love the place - I mean, I really love the Botanic Gardens. I think what we have here in Singapore are some of the most beautiful - and I've been to many around the world. So, back to the review. Despite my genuine desire to enjoy Halia (over the years I've come back occasionally - each time telling myself not to bother after the dining experience), this last time was no different. Service was warm and helpful, and that was probably the only positive thing. My husband and I ordered a potato and leek soup, burger, and 62' egg on brioche (which sounded so sexy but was anything but). 15 mins after our mains arrived, the soup came - \u00a0it was brown, and tasted watered down and nothing like leek or potato. When we asked to return it, we were told it's homemade and definitely leek and potato. We said erm no.The mains, despite the wonderful descriptions on the menu, were underwhelming at best. Fries were anemic (you know, when they don't spend enough one in the deep fryer), beef patty dry (wagyu? Really?), and my egg dish was lackluster. It as as if the chef was rushing off somewhere. So I get that it's a lovely place in the loveliest of gardens. And like most food joints in attractions (or airports), you know people will come regardless. But for the prices Halia commands, I'd have loved if they had a wee bit more pride about the food.",

In terms of decor, it's a but dark (I guess that's in keeping with the Colonial feel of the Raffles complex) with heavy timber furniture, but it has windows all around to break up the mood a bit. The chef's soup is good, as is the bread basket. I particularly enjoy the Grilled Chicken Salad. Cocktails are good too. I'd come back again, no problem at all. Thanks.",

    "text": "really good food at this second branch of the halia-of-botanics at the wonderfully colonial raffles hotel. this place was impressive - and while it wasn't cheap, I dare say it was rather well worth it. friendly service, a quiet corner of the hotel, and retro furnishings (very appropriately so, and hence not too hipster) - and good food plus reasonable prices: I think this beats many of my recent gastroventures clear out the water. fine dining without poncy starched-up nonsense.the chef's soup of the day was a great start - a lightly truffled bowl of cauliflower puree. our middle courses carried the momentum of the great start: we were very pleasantly surprised by the beautifully arranged plates of cured kingfish and sous vide chicken leg. the flavors were intense but complementary; and the chicken might be one of the best executions of poultry I've had in a while. the skin was well-seasoned, the butternut squash a sweet counternote to the savoury dish - and really a feast for the eyes.their desserts were also really good. that makes it a winner from starter to fin - something that happens too infrequently. the sticky toffee was good - warm, with a slight drizzle of caramel sauce and topped with creamy vanilla-bean ice cream.the ginger nougat parfait was very interesting. almost like a room-temperatureish semifreddo, with a stick of puff pastry and grilled pineapple. it really is a lovely space - it might feel a little cramped if full house, but otherwise quiet and very cosy on a sunday. service was well-paced and unobtrusive, and so many things on the menu that I want to return to. one of the best meals I've had recently, from start to finish. wholly and unconditionally recommended.",
