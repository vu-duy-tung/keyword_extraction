They have old fashioned wooden lounge chairs down by the water where you can enjoy a beer and contemplate the meaning of life or whatever's on your mind. I'll go again on my next trip.",

Week nights in my opinion would be the best time to visit Coastes and \u00a0enjoy the sea breeze while sipping on cocktails. In terms of food, a must try dish would be their signature ribs which are cooked perfectly with a generous side of wedges. Definitely a place I would visit again but not over the weekend.",

At around 5pm on a Saturday, this place was packed pretty fast. Quite a number of long communal tables and smaller tables to accommodate small or big groups. We looked at the menu and hence decided on getting the Creamy Pesto Pasta and Calamari Rings.The Creamy Pesto Pasta was in a bigger portion than we had expected. The pasta contains Spaghetti with asparagus, mushrooms, bell pepper and Parmesan cheese in pesto cream sauce. The pesto sauce left lingering taste on the tastebuds and I enjoyed the mix of ingredients in the spaghetti. Calamari Rings was a little expensive but the tartar sauce that accompanied it was one of the best condiments I've tasted so far. Without squeezing the lemon on the calamari rings, you can taste the citrus while chewing on the calamari rings. The calamari was also chewy and the flour they used to fry made the dish crispy. They even sprinkled a good amount of pepper inside the rings so without the tartar sauce it was also perfect. Definitely a recommended beach bite.Overall, I enjoy the ambience that this place has to offer. And the prices of the food was pretty reasonable too considering it to be located in a touristy spot. Do try the calamari rings out if you are nearby :)",

I learnt my lesson and decided to go there during dinner when the sun has set and you can enjoy the outdoor ambience.1. Fish and chips $22 The portion of the fish and chips is really just for one. The fish seems big but it's really not. I was a bit upset with their portion of fries. I've had a side of fries before and they were way more generous with the fries then.But with the sea view and sounds, the taste of the food is improved some what.The fish meat was tasteless and the exterior wasn't crispy but rather mushy. It was very upsetting with my first cut into the fish fillet. Don't waste your money with this dish. Their pasts were better.2. Big bad wolf pizza $24This is big enough to share amongst 2. The bacon was very fatty and wasn't crispy but still added a lot of flavour into the pizza. They were pretty creative in this dish and in every slice you get all the ingredients. I enjoy thin crust and I liked this however it could've been in the oven for a short while more.3. Coastes wings $10$10 for 3 whole wings is probably the most expensive wings I've ever bought but it's cooked hawker style. BBQed with lime wasn't what I was expecting but the wings were juicy and sweet with the barbecue sauce. All in all, an okay place for food. Definitely expect to pay more. Hits and misses but I think their pastas is what I will go for if I ever visit again.",

We could even see the fireworks from the adjacent water show.Among the things we ordered and I tried were chilli crab dip, seafood stew and lobster spaghetti. The chilli crab dip was spicier than expected which went down well with a couple of my colleagues. However it could certainly do with more crab meat. It also did not come with mantou which was slightly disappointing. As for the seafood stew, it could have been fresher. The lobster spaghetti was distinctly average as well.The wine was actually the highlight of the evening as we ordered a good red. The dessert of brownie and ice-cream was also hard to miss and made up for the meal otherwise.",

Siloso Beach, while man-made, is a really fun and beautiful place. Coastes provides the perfect place to have lunch, watch the sunset or spend a relaxing afternoon. I really love the blue and white beach theme they have - it's very well done and very appropriate. They also have sun beds available for hire, complete with tables and umbrellas for private use. Moving on to the food. We stuck to the burgers on both visits just because of how amazing they were! They would have to offer one of the best burgers I've ever had. The patty was thick, juicy and so full of flavour. The bun was soft and tasty, and the sauce was incredible! Honestly, the thought of this burger, coupled with Siloso beach and a beautiful sunset is enough to make me want to drop what I'm doing and get back on a plane to Singapore! We also tried their take on a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was a little different, but still very tasty and I really enjoyed the biscuit base. The staff were all friendly and helpful, and prices were pretty standard. For me, it was definitely the standout bar along the stretch of bars at Siloso beach. I'd definitely recommend spending an afternoon here.",

So we said \"Okay, we didn't know, we won't eat anymore\"- \"No you have to put this away lah, or I have to hide this lah\" - \"But we have no where to put this, our bag is full\"- Guy start collecting the 2 boxes, took them and put them on my side table, away from us behind my bag \"I'm being very generous cleaning this for you lah!\"There were many lah and his attitude was just shocking.My whole life I have never encountered this kind of attitude from a service staff. \"Generous?\" No thank you, you can keep your generosity to yourself and your bar.5 mins later, he came back, took away the padding on the other chair, and started unfolding it, we told him \"My friend went to the bathroom, please leave her chair there\". He replied: \"Why didn't you tell me?\" and managed to give us a nasty look and walked away with more altitude.Are we supposed to announce to every staff there \"My friend went to the bathroom, please do not take her chair away\" every time one of us go to use the washroom??? Feel like our peaceful afternoon got ruined by someone who is untrained and PMSing, we asked another staff for his name and said that we would like to talk to the manager. The staff refuse to give us his name, that's fine, the manager came over, apologized, saying he's got regulars (mind blown)I do not expect 5 star service at a beach bar, and I am quite used to bad customer service here but this is ANOTHER LEVEL of rudeness, a whole new level. We did not come there to pay money for chairs, food, drinks and be treated like that, so you can take out your miserable life on us, we were not told no food allowed so we did not know, if you tell us we will just stop eating. You do not have a right to mistreat your customers just because you feel shitty.If you can't do your job, quit! Don't treat others like we owe you. I wonder if all the other 1 star reviews are thanks to this gentleman \"lah\" This make me doubt the hiring, the training of your staff and Trust me we won't be back to pay money to be treated like this again.

Given the high price of alcohol in the country, I was pleasantly surprised at the freshness and fruity flavored offered by the national cocktail! (Far better than the second rate versions found around the globe!)We got seated on the sand benches so it was easy to quickly run into the water while waiting for our order. Additionally, we were able to catch the fireworks from the Wings of Time show performing next door.If your going to pay $17 for a cocktail, it might as well be made with fresh fruit and include a beautiful view! Coastes is definitely a gem in the over commercialized rough!",

    "text": "Probably one of my favorite places in Singapore.This is a beachfront restaurant, that doesn't rush you through, has good food and nice bathrooms.I've been coming to Coates for years, and before they remodeled a few years ago I didn't enjoy it as much, it felt small and cramped and had small, not good for changing, bathrooms. Really difficult with sandy children or anyone. They have since remodeled, expanding and opening up their kitchen into a show kitchen style. And they seriously upgraded their bathroom facilities, it now has two shower/changing areas, one that is big enough for a family of five or more. The advantage of this is that you can spend many hours here and a place to shower and change is most welcomed. I know there are many different experiences at Coastes, I have never been there in the evening, or during the week, I am only there on a Saturday or Sunday morning with kids. Get there early and claim a table and then let the kids loose in the sand and the water. I say to get there early because once you have a table you can just camp out and enjoy the beach. But, while you are there make sure you order some food because it is very good as well. It has a large variety, with western and Asian food, more western, and a full bar with great mixed cocktails as well. They have recently launched their own mobile ordering app that is great which lets you order and pay from your table without waiting in the ordering queue, then just sit back, and wait for the food to come out. The beach is nice and clean and even has some lounge chairs you can rent for $20/day. For all of the comments about the view being ruined and all of the ships spoiling. Find another country, anyone who has spent more than a day or two knows you can not look out of Singapore without seeing the ships, that is the nature of the country and the busy port.I highly recommend this place for families with children, just not when I am there because they are already filling up ;)",

    "text": "If you're heading to Sentosa, this is ideally where you would go eat. A really casual, right-on-the-beach spot that enables you to enjoy the tranquility of the waves without all the commercial antics of the rest of Sentosa (at least based on what I saw as we drove/walked past everything else to get here). The food is decent, but it's really the casual charm of this place that had me hooked. After days of working a big event in a conference center, it was just wonderful to be outside and enjoying the cooler evening air, the sand between our toes and the beautiful setting for a meal to celebrate. I had the burger, which was good. I should have probably ordered a Tiger beer instead of the Singapore Sling, but figured I had to try it at some point, so why not do it in a tropical setting...just realized it isn't quite my thing, so the beer would have likely been better. It appears that they have live music on the weekends, so that likely makes it more vibrant and could lead to longer waits. They do take reservations and were prompt in responding to my online inquiry and flexible when the number in our party changed. All in all, it was a good evening out, so thank you Coastes!",

Service was OK, certainly better than many places at Sentosa, but the food quality was very good. From a simple burger and fries to their pasta, garlic prawns and chicken curry, there was nary a sound from the six of us as we ate the food. Definitely will be returning.",

    "text": "We brought our large dog with us for a dinner on the beach after his first outing at Sentosa. We arrived at Coastes after 6, the place was not busy and we got a lovely table next to those on the beach. Without asking, our waiter brought a large bowl of water for our dog, which he was happy about. Then he settled down and we proceeded to enjoy a meal of seafood platter, wings and cocktails. Service was great, we (dog included) felt very welcome, and the view of the sunset was beautiful. All the waiters we encountered seemed right at home with our dog so I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good dinner spot to bring your large dog. The only reason for deducting a star is that the wings really can be better, hopefully they will improve!",

    "text": "I am not usually a fan of Sentosa, largely because I am uncomfortable with its recent evolution into an ostentatious playground for the rich.Coastes, however, has a strong family-oriented vibe during the day, and the set-up by the beach is casual and pleasant. It has a great beach shack feel, and I love the combination of white and blue. The crowd during the weekends is a good mix of tourists, local youth and families. Being part of the Emerald Hill group, the biggest draw is definitely the food. We had the burger and margherita pizza which were good and satisfying. The array of cocktails is also diverse, and we were pleased with the ones we tried. The only annoying bit is their odd policy of requiring patrons to order and pay at a central counter. Besides that, I would certainly return to Coastes for the occasional escape from the city because of the food and feel-good vibes.",
