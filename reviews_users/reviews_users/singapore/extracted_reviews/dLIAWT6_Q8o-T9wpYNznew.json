It is pretty easy to get a reservation on Chope, or even as a simple walk-in on a busy Friday night in Sentosa.My first impression was thinking...this is definitely one of the least attractive spaces to label as a Michelin Star (that is, one that isn't a hawker). It looked like a normal cafe with an identity conflict being casual vs dressy. However, my mind changed pretty quickly when I encountered the impeccable service from the very beginning. The hostesses are amongst the kindest and most professional I've ever come across in ANY restaurant. I was quickly seated and provided the giant one page menu and their drink menu which was mostly French and Australian wines, with a lacking cocktail menu. The wine sommelier (quite a young sommelier for a Michelin Star restaurant) assisted me in selecting a bottle of Australian Shiraz which was actually also their house Shiraz and quite good. I ordered the following:1) Truffled Kalamata Olive Flatbread - They served this with a Pistachio butter that came in what looked like a toothpaste tube which was slightly unattractive. The flatbread was a nice starter.2) I unfortunately don't remember which steak I ordered but it was the recommended Australian steak. It definitely was not presented well but had a great flavor that I truly enjoyed. They give you two small beakers with a sesame sauce and some other sauce that you can play with along with three side garnishes to enjoy. The meat was extremely soft and flavorful.3) Hot Chocolate Soup for dessert - This was their recommended dessert but I can't understand why. You are literally served a cup of hot chocolate sauce (similar to the lava from a Chocolate Lava Cake) and a cup of vanilla ice cream. That's it. It's as if I was drinking a rich hot chocolate with a side of vanilla ice cream. Very unoriginal and I felt ripped off by this.Frankly, although this restaurant had good flavors and solid service, I scratch my head thinking how this was awarded a Michelin Star. CUT at Marina Bay Sands is lightyears ahead of OSIA (my opinion) with regards to flavor, drinks, wine, ambiance, everything and that is what you would actually be comparing in the same category. Michelin aside, it's good although not entirely memorable.However, if you are on a Michelin Star hunt, extremely hungry for steak and stuck in Sentosa, then I would definitely recommend OSIA.",

    "text": "The boyfriend brought me here for our staycation at Sentosa. Let me just start off by saying that their Sour Cream & Onion flatbread is to die for! It also comes with a side of this chickpea-like paste (I forgot what it was called), which paired well with it. It's a good starter for those with smaller appetites, because it leaves space for the heavier stuff.We also shared a seafood platter; grilled octopus, King prawns, scallops, a half lobster, and a small bowl of clams in white wine. They paired it with a side of hollandaise sauce & cocktail shrimp sauce, which were both really good!For desert we had the macadamia souffl\u00e9 - the portion was huge, and it was really tasty! No regrets loading the extra calories! Definitely would come back!",

Two kept coming by asking if they can take our unfinished plate. \u00a0If the plate is still half full, it MEANS we are still eating!!! \u00a0If we didn't finished our glass of wine pairing wait!!!! Who the hell bring a new glass out while we are still enjoying the previous glass.I know they are trying to carter to us their 5 stars service because the whole restaurant only got 3 tables but people need a little space enjoying their meal OMG!!! We don't need answer to 3-4 people what we are still enjoying our wine, our foods, Never coming back. \u00a0There are more better restaurant out there to try if the price we spent like Andre. \u00a0Btw/ the manager got really bad breath and he pour the wine like shit. \u00a0Fix that before your restaurant goes down the hole!",

Then this weekend, Celebrity Chef Andrew Turner of Hotel Caf\u00e9 Royal in London is presenting his specially created dishes (13 to 16 May) alongside resident Chef Scott Webster.We started our set dinner with some Stone Hearth Flat Bread served with extra virgin olive oil, butter and dip. Truffled Kalamata Olive and Macadamia Pesto are the hot favorites here and i enjoyed the fluffy hot bread when it was first served. Osia's Char Grilled Fremantle Octopus with cucumber apple slaw and green chili jam failed to impress with its rubbery texture. \u00a0Osia won me back with their Pan fried Foie Gras by with textures of banana (in espuma and caramelized form), Madagascar vanilla and Jamaican rum. It's a first having bananas paired with foie gras and it was surprisingly a good match due to the savory and salty caramelized bananas. The signature Osia dish is the Perch with sesame ratte potato, pea tendril, soy milk curd and a shiromiso glaze. Light tasting dish with a little sweetness from the miso.",

    "text": "We came here for a small celebration. Both ordered the set menu, one with 4 courses, the other with 5 courses. We also had the flatbread. The food is good, well-presented, with quality ingredients. The expectations are met for a good restaurant, but does not have the makings of an excellent one, we did not walk away wow-ed by the food. Our experience was marred by the inability of the wait staff to execute their duties with pride. They were malaise, and at time downright condescending and rude in their communication with us. Unfortunately, this was the case for 3 of the 4 wait staff we encountered. Despite an empty restaurant (only 3 other tables were occupied) and four wait staff loitering the area, the front of house was at a total loss. No one filled our water. We mentioned that we wanted wine with our mains, but no one followed up or offered the wine menu. When we were seated, one wait staff said \"We can offer you our flatbread, please choose two toppings\". We were later charged for the flatbread, and duly paid. However, this left a poor impression as we did not feel that the wait staff was unaware of the implications of the words she chose.We spent approx $350 for the dinner. For this price, there are numerous other places one have visited for a memorable dinner with better food quality and service. We will not return, and recommend that if you choose to patronise this establishment, try it for a casual night instead of a special occasion.",

    "text": "Osia's modern Australian, seafood-centric menu was excellent. Fresh, clean flavours abound, and cooking styles were deliberately kept delicate. Perhaps it's the lack of a dining crowd during lunchtimes, but Osia's set lunch menu, at only $45 for a 3-course set ($35 for 2-courses), is probably one of the most value-for-money ever. A competitively priced set lunch in order to draw in the customers, I supposeService was excellent at Osia. I'd gotten terribly lost in the labyrinth of a carpark and was an angry mess by the time I arrived at the restaurant, but the waiter was so empathetic, so cheery, downright nice, that it wasn't long before I cooled down. And despite a couple of serious cock-ups (the restaurant's power tripped which caused the credit card facilities to fail, so after 20 minutes of trying to swipe our cards, we were then told that only cash was accepted, and there was this faint stench of the sewage that reeked through the restaurant towards the end of the lunch dining hour), service recovery was fantastic. Apologies were profuse and sincere, and reparation efforts were made to provide us a better dining experience by way of a discounted return visit. We had:1) Mixed Flatbread ($11), a chewy confection burnished half with Truffled Kalamata Olives and the other half with Macadamia Pesto.2) A starting option on the set lunch menu, the Black Angus Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio, dusted with dukkah spice and topped with creamy egg mayonnaise: scrumptious.3) Cardamom Citrus-Cured Yellowtail Amberjack: another starter, crisp and refreshing, complemented by the mild sweetness of fennel and the fruity bite of a thick orange-ginger foam.4) Pan-Fried Foie Gras (supplement $12): a stellar mainstay in their rotating stable of appetizers. The melty richness of the liver was balanced with a whipped light-as-air banana mash, Jamaican rum and Madagascar vanilla.5) Onto the mains, the Chicken Leg Confit: set atop a velvety garlic potato mash, slathered in a luscious red wine sauce, and contrasted with the subtle bitterness of charred radicchio.6) Braised Compressed Oxtail: fork-tender, and laden with ratatouille and blanketed in a caramelized onion puree and robust red wine sauce.7) For a lighter entree, the flaky Grilled Perch, stewed with boiled potato and fennel in a tomato fish broth, was flavourful and exquisite. This was served in an earthernware and then ladled onto a bowl for consumption.8) For dessert, there was just the one option of a sublime Valrhona Hot Chocolate Soup with black pepper-spiked vanilla ice-cream and sesame crisp. Great textures and wonderfully balanced",

    "text": "A good friend J who works in the publishing industry is constantly inundated by requests for tastings in new restaurants, and so gets to nosh on very finely prepared food for free, often before the rest of us mere mortals. As a result, he has become somewhat spoiled in the gastronomical department, with very jaded taste buds. So when he rang me up one day and gushed about a new restaurant, I sat up and took notice. In fact, he even went so far as to proclaim it the to-go place to take someone he'd want to impress.When faced with such a bold statement., I quickly grabbed the nearest friend and went down to Osia as soon as our schedules allowed.Food : The truffled \u00a0kalamanta olive flatbreads were pretty yummy and came with a tube of squeezable dip which was really fun! I loved loved loved the seafood ice experience. Maybe I'm partial to seafood, and maybe also because I'm partial to sorbet, but this was such a great combination. I always believed that if one served the best produce, one needs to do very little to actually enhance its flavour. And nowhere was this clearer than in this particular dish, where the natural sea freshness of the food was sharpened and crystallised by the different accompanying flavours of sorbet. The foie gras was pretty well done, as was the compression of truffled water melon with goat cheese. The beef was decent but the barramundi was so-so. Didn't think much of the chocolate Valrhona soup but then I'm not much of a chocolate fan.Ambience : Lovely, we were there on a Wednesday and it struck a nice balance between bustling and a ghost town.Service : Excellent.Overall a great experience. Only complaint is that it's way out in RWS but would definitely return.",
