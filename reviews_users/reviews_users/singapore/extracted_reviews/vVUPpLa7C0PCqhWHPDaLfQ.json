The pork chop is good too.We had canned pig's trotters with bee Hoon recently. Wasn't as good as before. Not sure why. Maybe I'm less forgiving now because I just had the same from Beng Thin Restaurant (Hokkien) and it was fabulous.Had other dishes here before and they were all above average to good.They have homemade kaya too.The best dessert here is kueh kosui.",

Anyway, service is alright, service staff arent too friendly. They seem to think that they are so popular now they dont need to provide good service. And the bill came up $58 for 2 pax. Ordered a soup, pork cutlet, seasonal veg, sambal prawns and 2 plates of rice. $58 didnt really go a long way.You're better off at Loo's which is not too far away (just around the hood). Google for their address. Most recent price waa $38 for 7 dishes and 4 people. They are not open on weekends though.",

It's around $12-$15 for the small portions.\"The portion sizes are small and it will come to about $20 per person, for average food that your average HDB auntie whips up everyday. Seriously. Go knock on a random HDB household door; say you'll pay $10 for a bowl of whatever's for dinner that night. I promise you it will be at least at good as this disorganised no-air-con coffee shop masquerading as a hipster joint (and that pays local magazines and newspapers to review them).",

We ordered crispy chicken with ginger, steamed pork belly, stir fried beans, sliced fish and duck soup. The food was delicious (particularly the meats!) and came out literally within seconds of being ordered. Also try the kaya and gula melaka chiffon cake. I couldn't leave without buying some home. Will definitely be back! Paid $122 for 4 pax in total, so not your average cheap hawker experience. But for the food, fast and friendly service, I won't complain!",

    "text": "Read the reviews. Called up to make sure it was open. Went there, and photos look great. Ordered. And I have to say, I was very very disappointed. It did not even look vaguely appetising. Was already thinking : how the heck can fellow Yelpers give this place such a high score... Then I tasted it. Not bad. Not bad at all. Curry was decent in both texture and taste. Pork chop was very nicely done, it had the crispy-and-juicy combo just right. The portion size was just right for me, though I can think of a few people who would complain as the rice portion is a little less than usual. I throughly enjoyed it. Price tag to a pork chop curry rice = $9. Their menu looks has your usual flair of Hainanese dishes. The table next to mine had at least 2 families and the dishes on the table looks great. Look forward to going back there to try.A few tips : 1) if you have a party of more than 2, please call ahead to book. \u00a02) it is a coffee shop setting, so it can get pretty hot especially in the recent weather3) following from no. 2, if you are sitting inside, sit somewhere in the middle. This place is laden with spot lights. I know it is an attempt to provide the place with a modern feel, but heck, it makes the place soooooooo much warmer. 4) don't expect a lot of service...",

    "text": "My friend came from Melbourne to Singapore for one week and he stayed somewhere at Chai Yang Road. When he asked me to take him to taste local food, I did not know where to go since I am not very familiar with this area. We chances upon this place and the first thing I noticed is \"home-cooked\" hainanese food. My friend did not take port so we did not order pig trotters bee hoon. We asked for recommendation. In the end, we had ginger chicken which is one of their signature dishes, samba prawns, and long beans. For the portion of 2 people, it's just ok. Not too heavy and not too light. \u00a0My friend asked whether he could order one more veg. So we ordered broccoli. Yet he wanted to be spicy and the cook was able to customize the order and make it spicy. The bill in the end was $62. 4 dishes, 2 rice and 2 lime juice. \u00a0Reasonable price I would say. Because it is a home-cooked food kitchen, they are more flexible to customize orders and at the same time, very little MSG which is important. I also notice that the food was not oily like that I see in other food courts or hawker centers. The only thing is that they don't accept credit cards. So remember to bring debit cards or cash before you go. They also do not open on Tuesdays.",

We had the omlette, ginger chicken, steamed pork and broccoli. \u00a0Everything was good. \u00a0I particularly enjoyed the ginger chicken which is deep fried chicken with a sweet and sour seasoning, the chicken is juicy and sweet and I actually prefer this over the usual hainanese pork chop. \u00a0The steamed pork is just plain steam pork with a sour vinegar based sauce, very tasty as well. \u00a0They also serve home baked cakes and cookies but we were too full after the meal. \u00a0Great place for some hearty home cooking.",

After that meal, I've become a regular customer ever since and actually, I've never tried anything else from this place. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes Japanese katsu curry with pork cutlet. This version of the dish floors many other Japanese diners I've eaten in. \u00a0The pork cutlet is crispy, the serving is generous and it's deliciously prepared, served separately, the curry has a bit of a kick and tastes very much 'home made'. Situated on the ground level, this place is particularly serene for lunch or brunch. The surrounding greenery in the old tiong bahru neighborhoods adds a flavour of nostalgia. I keep telling myself I should try the other dishes but i never do!",
