    "text": "I read somewhere online that Singapore's best laksa is here, I have a slight disagreement over this. \u00a0But it's complicated. Let me explain.First of all, the set up is excellent. \u00a0You walk up to an iPad with light beeper hockey puck looking devices and simply push buttons to order your laksa to your liking. \u00a0When your order is ready, your beeper lights up and you pay and pick up your food. \u00a0That's a good system. \u00a0You pay for exactly what you asked for so there shouldn't be a problem right? \u00a0Eh...it's not that easy.What this implies is that, if you give this place a bad review about the quality here, you are to blame for not ordering it a manner that would make it taste good. \u00a0But I don't buy that at all because of the following: a basic laksa order should still be good. \u00a0Here it sucks. \u00a0If you order a \"standard laksa\" it costs $4 Sing dollars. \u00a0So what does that come with:A bowl, noodles, pretty good flavor, two shrimps, two tiny fish cakes, two cockles (very teensy cockles about the size of a pencil eraser each), bean sprouts and coriander sprinkled on top.If you order that, you're basically eating noodle and laksa soup with barely anything else in it. \u00a0That isn't laksa as far as I am concerned. \u00a0So how much do you have to pay to get \"normal laksa\" which is a bowl of noodles with at least 8 pieces of shrimp, lots of cockles and lots of fish cakes?For each add'l cockle topping you need to pay more. \u00a0Basically, you get nickled and dimed instead before you actually get normal laksa. \u00a0That means, the standard order isn't really laksa to begin with. \u00a0If anything, it's barely laksa. \u00a0That standard just isn't good enough.My advice to the owners here: \u00a0Standard order of laksa should have: \u00a010 cockles, 5 pieces of fish cake and 4 pieces of shrimp. \u00a0Then \u00a0charge extra for the same amount for the add-ons.So I took off two stars because the standard laksa is merely noodles and broth with a minuscule extra toppings to it.I did read that the broth has gotten watery and noticed that too however, I will not complain about that because they have plenty of pepper paste that you can add to it at each table.I also like the environment here and the system for paying. \u00a0It is very user friendly.Also, why not offer a raw egg too?In the end, I can say I've had better lahsa at Toastbox than what they served here.Potential here but needs to improve.",

    "text": "I'm not normally a laksa fan, but I have to say the laksa is very affordably priced and packs in a ton of seafood and flavor. Although the menu is quite fancy on an iPad touchscreen, the prices are very humble like a hawker stall. You don't need to pay GST or service charge either. The soup was full of cockles, shrimp, and fish sticks that I presume should be in a good laksa. The noodles were properly cut up so you could easily gulp it all up with a soup spoon. There are also top up options if you want to custom add any additional ingredients.The menu is pretty simple and straightforward: it's laksa or nasi lemak or bust.",

    "text": "This place is probably good for those who don't take much spicy food as the laksa is not that spicy and is a pale creamy yellow. Add the chili to get the spicy kick and familiar orange-yellow gravy. The laksa is lemak enough and the noodle is al dente. The cockles are tiny but it could be due to the season as other places are also serving tiny sized cockles. There are probably other places which serve better tasting laksa but I guess for Holland Village, this is one of the better ones around. The ordering system is too high tech for me and I find it takes longer when the place is not busy. But I can see how it will be a great help to the owners during peak periods.",

    "text": "Ordering laksa here is pretty simple - find what you want on the screen, the options are limited so it's pretty basic, choose your number and wait. When your order is ready, you pay and collect at the same time. Basic really, except ofcourse that you can choose to get ekstra shrimps, fish cakes, etc. That makes the first order a bit confusing. But as soon as you tried it once, you know the baseline and can order based on that the next time. In a city with four official languages and quite a few different accents, it can sometimes be difficult to customise your order, so I really don't have an issue with this way of doing it.The laksa consist of a bowl of well-seasoned (and but particulary strong) soup with a large portion of noodles, about two shrimps, a small handful of fish cake slices and quite a few cockles. For 4.5 dollars that's pretty good. It's definately possible to get cheaper meals in Singapore, but really with very much meat or good seafood.",

White rice noodles cooked in cocunut based gravy Hawker eatery style, you order at the counter, pay and bring your own food tray to the table. Best eaten with 'everything in', prawns, cockles, fish cake sliced and mixed in with dashes of condiments chilli and parsley flakes (these are found on every table).I normally have mine with a side order of two 'Otak's which is a spicy fish paste that's cooked under a flame wrapped in fragrant leaves. Not particulary filling unless you ask for an 'upsize' but always enjoyable. The downside is that there isn't all that much seating space and it can get pretty hot sitting outside. This is cheap and good. A must try Singaporean food experience.",

It's self-service and the shop is pretty small and can get crowded so it helps to have someone with you to help chope seats.
