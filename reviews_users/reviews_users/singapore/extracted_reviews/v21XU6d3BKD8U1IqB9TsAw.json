    "text": "The stalls have generic names (like 'Chicken Rice', 'Prawn Noodles', 'Yong Tau Foo', 'Cutlet Speciality', 'Fried Carrot Cake', 'Korean Cuisine', etc), so that stall holders can be replaced without much drama. This also means they cannot induce brand name hawker stalls to come - a strategy adopted by Food Republic at its 3 food courts (ION Orchard, Wisma Atria, and Isetan). No wonder the quality of the food is at least one notch below the others. - the food at the 'Indian Cuisine' stall is downright horrific, and choice limited; avoid it! On top of that, seating place is more limited, AND must be shared with brands that are not in the food court (SaladStop, ToriQ), whereas these brands do have their own seats and tables at Tangs and ION, respectively. But, given the prime position of Takashimaya, at meal times this is always packed solid; more than once I have seen customers fights over seats. Along with the Lucky Plaza food court(s), this is probably the worst on Orchard Road, although the Far East malls are positioned to be more downmarket, so that is less of a surprise.",

The vendors happily provide samples. You will find Japanese items with a Singapore spin, like Dorayaki filled with durian. I am a sweets lover so my brain nearly exploded from all the bakeries, waffles and even mini doughnuts. High quality Japanese rice is sold as well as seafood items and dim sum.",

Mouth drooling especially on an empty stomach as my sister and I were. \u00a0We settled on this stall listing steamed buns but noticed folks queued up for something only listed in Chinese. \u00a0We can't read Chinese characters so we asked what was it. \u00a0Steamed little rice cakes. \u00a0Then topped with minced dried turnip. \u00a0So we went with that. \u00a0 Yummy. \u00a0At another stall, it was all deep fried offerings. \u00a0Anything deep fried is a good thing. \u00a0I got the curry puff and the durian. \u00a0Yummy again.Not a whole lot of seating but we took our goodies to go.",

Overall a very crowded food court and it gets tricky to find a seat during lunchtime on any given day. The food here is well portioned and very delicious. Go for the nasi padang at the corner or try out the char siew noodle stall, both of which are my favourites.",

    "text": "I was a little disappointed in the food court here. There was plenty of variety of food, but I guess we ended up trying the wrong stalls. I got an iced Vietnamese coffee from Pho Hoa (okay, I probably shouldn't have gone there considering we have that in the US too), but the coffee was watered down and not good. We also tried some takoyaki balls from another stall, way too oily/soggy and not much flavor. The dessert shop was out of this mango dessert they seemed to specialize in, and we got some onigiri from a Japanese stall that was decent, but on the more expensive side. And on top of all that, we couldn't even find an open table for the two of us to sit at. I think next time, I'll have to try one of the night markets instead.",

The stalls has not changed at all, some of the dishes that were offered 10 years ago are still around. My regular round would be the roast duck noodle. Followed with takoyaki from Tako Pachi. Yum! It's just finding tables can be a little annoying. Be aggressive in order to feast in peace.",

From specialty swiss and belgian chocolatiers, to german cake shops to japanese bakeries to artisan teas and coffees...the list goes on. It has this vibrant, marketplace vibe that goes on as people wander from stall to stall, tasting samples, browsing prettily packaged foods. It can get a little too crowded on weekends and that makes it pretty frustrating to get around as the aisle are pretty narrow. Weekdays tend to be emptier and you can take your time to walk around and browse without worrying about blocking someone's way.One may argue that it has become a tad bit touristy and can be a little overpriced, but I suppose that's the price you pay for specialty imported foods.",
