After few attempts finally a lady answered my call and made the reservation for us. \u00a0Went earlier than our schedule time and received a warm welcome from hostess. The food was delicious but some servers need more polishing in terms of talking to guests and body language, One server was pouring my glass with water while talking to another waiter at the other side. Some waitress are very attentive and polite while others seems to be blind when I was raising my hand to get their attention to Ask for water while my partner was coughing. Nice view and food but service needs a lift.",

    "text": "It was the mom in law's birthday and the missus wanted to treat her to a luxurious Sunday brunch. if you have ever tried looking for a good Sunday brunch, most of the recommendations are for hotel buffets. but if you, like the missus, are not fans of buffets because you simply do not eat enough to make it worth your while, then you will have trouble.That's when we discovered that Level33 serves Sunday roast - the wonderful English tradition of pubs serving Roast and other food on Sundays that still lingers fondly in my memory of England. Sunday brunch at Level33 had a quiet expensive bustle with mostly rich customers on the 33rd level of the marina bay financial centre. The view is quite spectacular but nothing compared to MBS or One Altitude of course. the food was decent for its price. it's handcrafted beers were ok but we had better. To be honest it was one of those places we would go once to experience it and see what the fuss is about and probably never go back again. But the girls had fun playing tourist and taking photos on the outdoor balcony. you will also get an entertaining, but not necessarily pleasant, view of scantily clad residents walking around Marina Bay Residences.",

They said no charge. \u00a0Of course, it ended up on the bill. \u00a0When I pointed it out the guy went back to fix it. \u00a0When he came back the charge was still on because he had \"called his manager and his manager had said that we had ordered one in the first round and the other in the 2nd round.\" \u00a0There were no two rounds so I'm not sure if the server was lying or the 'manager' he called but regardless I said it wasn't acceptable and to take it off the bill. \u00a0He came back with it off but what is with that? \u00a0And then when we were paying cash and sorting it out, he was like \"don't you think it'd be easier to put on your card?\" \u00a0Felt very odd he was trying to force a credit card transaction. \u00a0The whole end was sketchy and ruined what had been a good night. \u00a0Unacceptable service.",

Possibly even better than at MBS, because you get to see the enormous building in all its glory, as well as its surrounds. As for the place itself? The beer is expensive and extremely bland. I'd take a Tiger over the offerings here for a fraction of the price. The food is just as bad, if not worse. Super expensive pub-fare, very bland. Honestly, all of this is to be expected. This place is all about the wow factor and they are hardly the first restaurant to capitalise on the tourist trade! We enjoyed our visit as a must-stop on our list and were happy to pay for the beer as the price of entry.",

    "text": "The Food - We had the Vday set meal so I am not sure if all the items listed here are on the regular menu. 1. Starters: - Fresh rolls with 3 different types of butter (love butter!!!)- Scallop (my favorite) & pork belly - Foie gras (excellent & Normally, I don't like this dish but this one was good. Whatever else I write will be an understatement for foie gras lovers so I'll stop here. 2. Mains: - Overall, quite disappointing especially after the spectacular starters. I have a feeling that this place excels in its niche - starters/finger food/desserts & (of course) cocktails/beers. However, not in their mains. \u00a0- The pan fried sea bass had a fishy smell that was not musk well which really irks me. Another big downer was that the fillet had so much small-annoying-hard-to-see bones in it. Beware! It was a chore to debone it and isn't worth the effort because it wasn't even that tasty to begin with. - Beef. I ordered mine medium-well. A precarious task because as most restaurants do not do this well. It comes often comes out over cooked (well-done). Level 33 was no exception. Also, they topped the steak with a strong cheese (melted on top of it) which really overpowered the flavor of the steak. The steak sauce was great but they gave too little of it, and whilst I tried to ration my meat to sauce ratio carefully in the end the sauce ran out before the meat. 3. Desserts: - Chocolate lava cake - Good! I love who they balanced out the sweetness of the chocolate with sea salt and cream cheese at the side. - Mascarpone - Great!!! even though they got our order wrong! We were suppose to have the banana dessert (whatever that was, it was recommended by our server) but this was excellent! I am a big fan of mascarpone so I might be biased. If you like cheesey-sweet treats like me, this one is definitely for you! 4. Drinks: - Excellent. I am not a big fan of beer. In fact, I NEVER order it. However, this microbrewery has changed my opinion. All their cocktails are beer based (I believe) and they were sooo good (with the exception of the stout. I am still, and forever will be NOT A FAN OF STOUT. The bitterness puts me off.) Even the plain beer alone is good. It has a really light taste, even lighter than Heikien.- Paris - Love x2! Very sweet though. - Blond mojito - Love x3. My favorite drink. - Beer - Love- Unknown stout cocktail with berries - Cannot Love, because of my predisposition to be biased against stout!!! The bf thought it was ok though. The Service - Good. The waiter was kind enough to throw in 2 free drinks. The first because I hinted it looked good. The second because our desserts took 45min to come. - Really appreciated their effort to be efficient. - They had a pre-set the dining table with a rose & a box of chocolates so definitely good news for the guys. Half the work has already been done for you. The View- It was AWESOME. Overlooking the entire marina bay :) How singapore has grown. I feel old already! - It's a bit chilly up there so definitely bring a jacket along. Overall: Will definitely be back here again with friends to grab a cocktail & snack on some starters.",

The beer is alright, but not interesting or worth the price tag. On top of that, I'm not sure that understand what an IPA is. Their Indian Pale Ale certainly haven't seen too much of the lovely hops. A pale ale, yes, but not indian.",

They brew their own beer, but you can also get the usual suspects of Tiger and Heineken. \u00a0I prefer their owne brew as its always tasty. \u00a0Do make reservations as the staff will give you the best spot in the house. \u00a0I am not a regular, but I do come as much as I can! \u00a0Way better than the other high dining, drinking spots in the area.",

    "text": "Being at the Marina Bay Financial Centre, you can probably guess the type of crowd that congregates here - there's lots of groups of bankers coming straight from work, which gives the place a very smart atmosphere and you'd probably feel out of place (but not unwelcome) in more casual attire. The atmosphere was buzzing, and the view is outstanding.The craft beer here isn't anything to write home about - I ordered five samplers of ale and was a bit disappointed in the lack of diversity in the flavours between the ales. They're very conservative flavours, and the ales will be enjoyable by most. Hailing from the UK, though, I might be being a bit harsh compared to the selection I enjoy there.We interacted with at least three waitresses/waiters, and the I have to say, the service was absolutely phenomenal. They must have taken recent criticism of the other yelpers into account! The wait staff did a great job of helping us order the right amount for our party size and making sure the meals came on time. The food was great, but boy do you pay for it! It's overpriced, for sure, but it is pretty decent. The view is fantastic, and Level33 is definitely a great place to bring visiting friends to get a wonderful sunset view of the bay. Will I be visiting again for dinner without guests? Not really, as the price doesn't really justify the quality of the food to me.That said - the pre-8pm $13 for 500ml is a pretty good deal, so I'd highly recommend you visit for a drink, the view, and the ambience, at least.",

I met up with a decently large group of friends here with a reservation for 2 tables outside. We tried to get moved to a smoking spot because we saw some were free, but they said it was all taken, so my friends were not able to have their cigars.The spot is very chic and modern. There's an elevator within the financial building that goes directly to the venue.We got the craft beer sampler, with 5 samples of their own beers, then got more based on what we liked. Overall, the beers were alright. I liked the blond. I did not like the stout or the mixed stout with the pale ale, which they said was one of the beers. Lots of color but not much flavor. I know Singapore has high alcohol taxes, but you think for like $20 the beer would be better than that.Anyways, a nice hangout spot, if a bit expensive. It does get a little windy up there.",

Sometimes the balcony gets rather crowded but usually you can get a table after 20-30 minute wait or can always enjoy the view and come back inside for drinks.

The doors open directly into the restaurant were you will be greeted by the smell of brewing beer.Their crafted brews are of European heritage and made using state-of-the-art technology by SALM & Co Gmbh. They have a 33.1 Blond Lager, 33.15 India Pale Ale, 33.3 Stout, 33.4 House Porter and 33.9 Wheat Beer, with seasonal brews on the menu. \u00a0You can see the beautiful copper kettles, and silver beer vats as you walk throughout the space. \u00a0You can order a beer paddle which gives you a 0.1 litre taster of five LeVeL33 craft brews (of your choice from the options available). \u00a0This is a perfect amount for sharing. \u00a0The seasonal Golden ale was the table favorite. \u00a0The other beers were OK. \u00a0Very 1 dimensional. \u00a0Lacked character or flavor. \u00a0Had a single flavor profile which made it pair well within their beer cocktails. \u00a0Their beer cocktails are unique and tasty. \u00a0I would highly recommend them as the way to go here for the price. The food menu highlights European classics with a twist. The food was GREAT. \u00a0Out of the sides our table favorite was the pumpkin. \u00a0The broccolini, corn, and heirloom tomato were also tasty. \u00a0The starters are also good. \u00a0The Ploughman's board was the best. \u00a0The seafood medley was OK. \u00a0I would definitely suggest the ploughman's board as the cured meats were addictively tasty. \u00a0I loved the crostini and rye bread that they came with. \u00a0Be sure to save room for the mains!Our table had a mix of different mains. \u00a0From fish, to the different options of gnocchi, to the Beef & Reef, and grilled meats. \u00a0Everything was cooked to perfection. The chevre gnocchi was OK, the original gnocchi was better. \u00a0The Beef and Reef was pricey, but good. \u00a0It is quite the show as they bring out the lobster and throw it in a pot of boiling water for a minute. \u00a0The meat cut like butter. \u00a0Amazing flavors and large portions. \u00a0You will leave full. \u00a0The prices are high. This would be a place for special occasions. \u00a0You pay for tasty food and excellent views. \u00a0Unfortunately, the beer wasn't great, but if you stick to beer cocktails or their other selection of drinks you will be OK. \u00a0With the large price tag you want to ensure you are getting something great.The service was friendly and prompt for Singapore. \u00a0.",

There are other restaurants and bars with great views but you can't go wrong with a visit to the bar for a cocktail or brew.In addition to the bar, there are indoor and outdoor tables. The ambiance is interesting. It's \u00a0rather loud and appears to be a mix of after-work office workers and other patrons who go for the view. Overall, it's very pleasant. The staff on both occasions that I visited were very friendly and attentive. Service was excellent.It's a brewhouse and restaurant in one. I tried about 4 different beers. All were good but none were special. Like the beer, the food was good but it wasn't great. Unlike the beer, the food is pricey.Our steaks were cooked to order. The tenderloin was very good. The ribeye was very thin. It was definitely disappointing. I expect ribeyes to be triple the thickness of the steak that I was served. It was tasty but the flavor fell short of top notch steakhouses.My party split a Level33 Mess, which was a mess of shapes, colors, textures and flavors. It was good but nothing special. I think whoever created this dessert was trying too hard to come up with something different and unique.Prices are what you might expect for a restaurant with a view in the financial district of Singapore but not ridiculous given the restaurant's decor, service, and the view.It's worth a visit for the view, nice ambience, and good service. The food is decent too; just don't expect great food or beer.",

More classic malts and hops result in a cleaner, more restrained aroma and flavor than the in your face American style.On this visit, a very British style IPA. Extremely refreshing finishing only slightly better. Extremely clean on the palate. The stout, dark and brooding with excellent roasted grain notes and a sweet finish. Finally the wheat beer, very German in flavor. Unfiltered, beautiful citrus and banana notes, finishing sour. \u00a0Basically any of these beers could be bottled and sold as European. They're that good.All beer served in 0.3 L or 0.5 L pours.Note: prices increase on all drinks after 20:00. \u00a0Think of it as a nighttime view charge.Sadly no food sampled. I could not get my dining companion to eat the kangaroo or a dish called pig and snails.Excellent, proper service.Located in CBD, MBFC T1, 33rd floor. \u00a0Look for its separate elevator. Reservations recommended. It gets busy by 18:00.Note: despite how busy the taxi stand is, \u00a0it is incredibly difficult to hail a taxi. \u00a0Be sure to use Grab.And essential experience while visiting Singapore.",

The beer of course was refreshing and nice. I must say that the ambiance and view from level 33 looking out to the Singapore river and Esplanade was fantastic. Now come the food. Well, \u00a0I was a bit disappointed with the food as it \u00a0was just 'ok'. We ordered the Pig & Ssnail and Hokkaido Scallop for starters. The starters were fine. Unique mixture of the cream sauce blended well with the pork belly. The scallop was much nicer, again with good blending with the cream sauce. As for the mains, we ordered the Jumbo Prawns and Australian Bangalow Pork. The presentation was great but the they tasted as I mentioned earlier 'ok' only. They were pretty plain and \"not enticing\". The portion was more than enough for the both of us. As for the desserts, the mini chocolate lava cake was good. Not so much the same for the rest of the chocolate stuffs. Finally, their service. I must say the service was excellent. The staffs were firendly and they replace new clean plates after each course. In conclusion, if you are going there for the ambiance and the beer, that \u00a0 would be a great place to go. If you are expecting great food, other places like Morton, Ruth Christ, Lawrey's might be a better choice.",

It also offer interesting choices of beer, but I did not try the beer on this visit. They offer set menu during lunch time. There is a buffer starter with choices of salads, pasta, cheeses, smoked salmon. Desserts are also part of the buffet. Not great but adequate. I chose the fish and chips for main course. The fish was quite 'skinny' and somewhat tough and dry. The chips are large sized ones. Between 3 or 4 stars; decided to be on a generous side, as the ambient is quite good and the view is appealing.",

All were good, their stout was probably my favorite, porter coming in second (porter is not in the picture though).The atmosphere was great and the view was absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend visiting for a beer. There food looked delicious, all I had was a salad and their mushroom flight. Things started adding up fast so I didn't get a main course. It is rather expensive, but that's how it is in Singapore. Will definitely visit again during my next trip.",

Yes drinks are 'pricey' --$13.33 for half liter, but with the incredible view outdoors (and my conversion of the prices to USD) it's completely worth it. My boyfriend and I came for drinks on a Friday around 6- no reservation and of course no seated table, but we managed to get a standing table right next to the viewpoint on a pleasant evening. Their beers were delicious and you can easily watch the gardens by the bay and marina bay light shows in the evening. Decided to get some appetizers to pick on while drinking- the lamb chops were relatively good, but the chicken winglets were not worth the cost. Great atmosphere- can't wait to return to try their pumpkin beer.",

I've experienced better.\" The ambiance was very luxury/formal and the view was great, but would never go back nor recommend it - even on someone else's tab.WHAT I TRIED: Foie Gras + Seafood Medley + Ploughman's Board + Wagyu Steak + Red Wine-------------------MORE DETAIL-------------------FOOD: OK: Food was actually good, but not worth the price. There are so many better places for the price (and even for cheaper). I was very unimpressed with the food. The Ploughman's Board had a TON of meat, but no cheese or veggies and not enough bread/crackers - we didn't even get halfway through it despite having about 10 men in their 20s in the group! The Seafood Medley had a \"meh\" selection of seafood. The shrimp was good and that was about it. The wine and foie gras were good, but nothing special. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out medium. It was too chewy, but it was flavorful.SERVICE: SUBPAR: This is some of the slowest and inattentive service I've ever had. We asked for water several times to several different waiters before half our table got water - and then the other half about 10 minutes later. I ordered a glass of wine, which was delivered to another woman in our party at the opposite end of the table - and it was only when I asked where mine was 20 minutes after ordering it that they said they had already given it to me.... except they had given it to her. AMBIANCE: GREAT: Topnotch luxury with a great view and beautiful interior. Very fancy.",

I ordered the pork belly which was good but not great. I found it interesting they make the beer in full view (and full smell) behind the bar. As anyone knows who's brewed their own, that sh&t smells nasty and they kept the door to exterior open most likely for that reason. I would absolutely recommend this place for a date night or a beer aficionado. I only had the IPA which could have been a little hoppier but it was still tasty.",

    "text": "Been here a couple of times to unwind after work. They labelled themselves as the \"world highest urban craft brewery\" and man, actually the view up here is splendid! Take the inside seats facing outdoors, as it's really not that chill after all staying outdoors in this 365 summer Singapore.I chanced upon a post by a friend on the Saturday brunch buffet and decided to give it a try for my big boy's birthday. It's a minimalist brunch compared to the hotels buffet we usually come across, which I like about it as the selection is small but great individually! We made reservation through a 3rd party app, and the staff called to confirm my reservation the day before. On Saturday itself, we were held up by some errands on the morning which we called to delay our reservations twice, and the staff responded positively to our request and I'm truly thankful for that!The selection are very clear in 1 small confined area. Cold selection, hot selection, cheese, soup, desserts. That's all we've got. There's nothing international about the Saturday brunch. Cold selection includes salami, some seafood, salad. Hot selection includes foei gras, mini eggs ben, mini blue cheese quiche tartlets, roast beef, sausages, and 2 more dishes I couldn't recall. Desserts and cheeses are cluttered at one corner. Well, I'll pass the soup next time. Soup served on that day was a tomato relish sort of soup (well it's not labelled), and it tasted super salty which I stopped after 2 mouthfuls. There's also a selection of bread which you can choose to go with it. Apart from the soup, I love how all the rest are served so nicely.The highlight of the brunch is definitely their craft beers, beer cocktails, and special beer cocktails of the month! It's your a hardcore beer drinker, you can opt to top it up for the \"beer buffet\" version from the normal buffet price of $58++. Alternatively, you can order the beer separately. For a brewery, buffet and beer combination is definitely the way to go!One of the nays will probably go to the service. Staff do not give you much attention and you just gotta try your best to wave hard, or go up to them. My plates are not cleared promptly, neither was my water filled. I don't know if it's the privacy time which they are trying to give us, or they simply don't care. However, they are not rude la, still can make it.Finally, the view up here is a true win! We enjoyed the lovely view over brunch, which makes our Saturday slow paced and relaxed. They also live up to their name as a brewery for the tasty draft they served! It was an enjoyable weekend brunch which I'll be back again.",

But at $22 a pint in the evening hours, you'd expect the beer to taste somewhat decent, considering the place claims to be a \"craft beer\" brewery. But it's no better than what you'd find in a 7-11 or such.One thing that's worth coming here for is the awesome view! And furthermore, the light show going on right across the water is one great thing to watch while you're here soaking in the backdrop. They didn't lie when they said it was the world's highest brewery at 33 levels above ground. Don't come here with hopes that you'll get a good beer craving satisfied. There are plenty of other places in town that offer better tasting beer just in bottles. But it's totally worth it to come just for the view alone, which makes up for their average tasting brewskies.",

    "text": "Disclaimer- tourist review. Get here early or else everyone will take up the prime spots outside with the gorgeous view. Luckily a group of us 4 came and snagged a pretty nice spot and was able to take awesome pics. Great beer and wine selection and we all just had 2 each. Of course I can't remember (not very useful, sorry) what I got but there was a pretty strong stout that was really really good. Really liked the ambiance of the entire place. It was obviously more upscale and the prices reflected that. Service could get a bit tricky at times but not a big deal. Didn't get a chance to order food except little nuts and olives. I didn't get to dress up very much in Singapore since most people dress pretty casually but this is the one place where I could have and fit right in. I was actually a bit surprised by such a different crowd of people than what I had seen all week walking around. Anyhow, that's from a \u00a0tourist POV!",

    "text": "nice, chill place to hang out with a glass of wine - and have a dessert (or two). this local microbrewery is pretty top-of-its-class, with a view up on its place on the thirty-third floor (the name's a no-brainer, really), with a good selection of food and drinks, a good mix of standing and sit-down space - and it feels pretty cozy, even with the throngs of people that come here post-work.I'd like to talk about their desserts too (a proper meal here is still a pending to-do) - and in particular, this interpretation of a sticky date pudding with triangular block of cake topped with a fig compote and goat's cheese caramel. it's a subtly sweet cake that plays up to the sharp savoriness of the goat's cheese (which isn't something I usually eat, but this was properly moderated), and the soft vanilla ice cream on the side.very pretty, very modern, and a well-portioned plate of enough sweet to sate without cloying.I've also tried their fondant previously, and it's pretty good too - but I'm working my way up to the assiette, which is a two-person platter of dessert. I could really do with one right now.p.s. it's a nice view outside, but too damn hot. I'll stick with the aircon.",

While it's best to book for the outdoor seat, you should be able to get a standing table after 9PM. Service is usually great as well!They have a variety of beer to choose from. If you can't decide, order the sampling set first. I haven't tried their food nor their cocktails, but they look decent.",
