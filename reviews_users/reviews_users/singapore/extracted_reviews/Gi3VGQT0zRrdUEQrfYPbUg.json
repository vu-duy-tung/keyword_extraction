I actually came back for the salad, fruit and veg is expensive to buy in small quantities in Singapore (except bananas) and I was craving something crunchy. If you order chicken and rice you also get a bowl of soup (cabbage? Pork ribs? Mild but tasty and nourishing). All up $5 which I found good value. The guy was quietly amused when I didn't take the chilli sauce the first time so I did take it the second time",

At $32 for a whole bird, the price is reasonable",

    "text": "Ohhhhhohohoho.Thanks to Charles Ryan T., I believe I just experienced one of the more underrated chicken rice spots on the island.Walking into the basement food centre of Katong Shopping Centre was like taking a step back in time to decades ago Singapore. I didn't notice any renovations, and I hope they keep it that way. I also noticed there were no ang mos here. I wonder why that is. (I'm serious!)I came in about an hour before closing and the queue was very short. I asked the uncle for one boneless chicken rice.* While preparing my meal, he asked I where I was from.Me: I'm from US.Uncle: Upper Serangoon?Me: *Confused*Uncle: In Singapore, US means Upper Serangoon.Me: Ahhhhhh I see what you did there!Funny uncle! :) Once my food was served, I noticed some differences:1) My chicken actually had chillis on it, which made it a slightly spicier chicken rice.2) The soup was very different- unlike the usual chicken stock, this time it was beef based, with sliced potatoes. It might change every day because when I look at the Yelp photos, it appears to be different in each one.3) There is a huge bowl of pickled salad, which is self-serve and free flow. The salad had cucumber, jalapenos, pineapples, and red onions.4) Also, while waiting, I noticed the uncle would spritz a few orders with a mystery liquid. Not sure what it was, but really interesting practice!For $4.80, I was floored at how unique and truly delicious their boneless chicken rice was. However, I found mine a bit dry- but dousing it in the beef based soup made it even better. And of course, I experienced this when my phone was dead so I have no photos to show. This just means I'll have to return and experience the glory all over again! --*There is a sign on the stall that says you must tell them if you want the chicken boneless.",

    "text": "Thanks Charles T. for an Amazing Chicken Rice recommendation. Who knew there was a gem of a chicken rice place at the basement of Katong Shopping Centre! This chicken rice was different than the ones usually found on the Red Dot. This was a MAN's chicken rice. The flavours for what usually is a bland dish was just incredible. Garlic, spring onions, and the Chillis! Oh man, the Chillis. It really gives this baby a kick!I also got side of soup, which reminded me of, what my mom used to cook back home. Not necessarily good, because it's filled with cabbages and other veggie blandness. Hehe. The rice was not anything special.Definitely, my favorite chicken rice place in Katong. Will likely be my new go to place for chicken rice, if I have a serious craving!",

Honestly, I couldn't tell you what made me choose this place but i'm glad I went. The chicken was perfectly cooked, the gingery-chili sauce that accompanied it was delicious and the pickled fruits and veggies on the side absolutely made the meal. I can't stop thinking about this place and wish I could go back right now. As a note, this place isn't fancy. It's on the basement level of the the Katong Shopping Center and you simply walk up, order and take your food to a table. But who needs fancy when your food tastes like heaven in your mouth?",

What I can say however, is that the Chicken rice served here is, as it's name states, absolutely delicious. The gamers at the nearby LAN shop call will call their specialty wicked sick. I have been patronizing this place since 2003 and the consistency in the chicken hasn't changed much over the years. I came with a friend who just got back from the States for holiday and he was kind of missing this local fare. He claims he's able to make real Hainanese chicken over there - dousing the hot cooked chicken in cold water so that the fat layer stays on the meat and serving it with a nasty chili concoction. However, no hesitation at all when I mentioned KSC basement's Chicken rice.We ordered half a chicken (white) opting for a serving of achar (onions, pineapples, etc.) and a bowl of chicken soup. The rice was tasty but I thought it was better years ago. Still fragrant though.The chili was not too bad. My friend went back three times to take additional servings of it.Great to see them proud of their endorsement by yelp. Hope to see more of my favorite businesses do the same.Oh anyway, the chicken rice at marine parade hawker center nearby is pretty good too.",

I'm going against my vegan ways to tell everyone about how awesome this chicken rice is. There's been a long and ongoing debate, especially in the Katong area, about the best chicken rice in Singapore. Some go for Boon Tong Kee, others support 5-star and then there's Tian Tian Chicken Rice; all of these can be found withing a 1 to 200 metre radius from Katong Shopping Centre's basement. But this is the one you don't know about that you need to go to. What most people generally agree is important for chicken rice is 1. The rice 2. The chilli and then the chicken comes in 3rd, almost like an afterthought. This place has the sort of rice you could eat plain and be perfectly content with, chilli that makes your mouth burst (with flavour, not hotness) and chilli soaked with soy sauce, garlic, and who knows what other sorcery is in there. Mainly, the garlic. You can see it, you can taste it, and you'll always want more of it. I never have meat cravings, but when I see this stall, I admit. I've been tempted a couple of times before. Try it, and enjoy it, and do it on my behalf. The underdog always wins, in this case. No need for chain stores or a good marketing plan. Just damn good chicken rice.",

Tender with a very tasty sauce that comes with it. azhar and kiam chye is also part of the deal as you can take as much as you want if you eat in. The only reason why I am not giving a higher rating is the rice, of which im not that big a fan. It comes it this strange yellowish color, and is not very fragrant, which goes in direct contradiction with the previous review. So I'm guessing that it works for some and not for others.

The rice here is really smooth and fragrant, and the chicken is oh so tender. I ordered the roast chicken and the skin was very flavorful. Another thing was that the serving size here also seemed to be larger than at other places (in terms of the quantity of meat and the rice), so perhaps this is to compensate for their slightly higher prices. The chili complemented the chicken perfectly as well.Overall, I would definitely rate the chicken rice here among the top 5 in Singapore.",
