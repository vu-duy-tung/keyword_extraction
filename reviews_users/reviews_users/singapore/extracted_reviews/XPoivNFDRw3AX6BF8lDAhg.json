I think it is really yummy, considering there is no other kebabs to fight with int he surrounding area. I can only vouch for the chicken \u00a0and I have tried the beef kebab, which does not taste as good. it is obviously at a super convenient location and for something about $10, you can either go for this, salad stop, food court or something at lucky plaza? I wouldn't mind kebab anytime :)",

    "text": "It's an okay place to grab a bite along Orchard Road. My husband and I was thrilled to find a shawarma place near our hotel and we were lured in by the smell. The chicken shawarma was big and filling, as well as the big order of fries that came with the combo, but the taste itself was just so-so. It lacked some flavor, in my opinion. Although we were asked to choose the sauces to come with our shawarma (we went with the garlic sauce and chili sauce) so maybe it's partly on us. Will try to be more adventurous with the sauce choice next time.",

    "text": "One of the best tourist trap due to their strategic location in front of ngee ann city on orchard road. Good job for them! Okay let me sit down first to specifically write down this review to warn you all although it almost rains and I got to run to santouka to wash out the after taste of the food just now. I ordered the supposedly 'premium' lamb kebab for 10.50$ which became 11.50$ for an additional topping of cheese that was supposed to make my experience more than delicious right? Wrong! It was a fiesta of soggy wrap and tendons of lambs! It has been a while since I feel completely ripped off. The lamb (tendons) might as well be used to create a brand new car tyres. So what else left for kebab to be desired when the wrap and the meat are fucked up? Nothing apparently but an urge to be done with it (since I pay 11.50 freaking bucks for it) and an oath to never glance at this place again (and refrain not to swear). I bet there are better kebab places in Singapore. For now I will keep yearning for a real kebab experience in New York.",

    "text": "This is where I get my falafel fix. For days when I am missing hummus and falafel, I would get the falafel wrap from Shiraz Mazzeh. They do a pretty decent job with a good mix of greens and falafel all wrapped up in a tortilla and toasted to perfection. I definitely like this version than the one at Pita Pan.If you do ask for it to go, eat it soon as it can get a bit soggy after a while. But if you eat it within 5 mins or so, it will remain warm and crispy and oh so delicious. There are also meat versions - chicken, beef. I can't remember if there is lamb too. There are a few high tables for those who like to have it there, but otherwise, most will get it to go and eat as they walk along the stretch of Orchard Road.",

You can order chicken, lamb, or beef kebab and get it with a drink and fries. You can also pick your preferred sauce (garlic, my friends). It's really good, really filling, and right on the sidewalk.",

    "text": "Walking along Orchard road has is like walking into a huge wonderland full of shopping malls, potong stalls, weekend street performers, and a new discovery-a shawarma joint called Shiraz Mazzeh. the stall can easily be found in front of Ngee Ann City, just keep your eyes wide open because you might miss it.You have an option to eat at the bar or take advantage of the outdoor seating. For a meal worth less that $10, you can enjoy this wrapped up snack under the Singapore sun with or without chilli and your choice of drink.I had the chicken shawarma with just mayo, no chilli. and a bottle of water. Back in my hometown, I make it a point to just order water alongside the wrap because the flavour is intense that you do not want to miss out on anything. Besides, I didn't put in chilli so I'm pretty much OK. If you find yourself at Orchard road looking to try out something new, this stall is just there waiting to serve you. It is best enjoyed during the sunny days. But if you're like me who braved the rain just to try the Shiraz place, then by all means, go for it.",

    "text": "When I walk past a Shiraz booth and I look at the slowly roasted meats on the rotisserie grill, I can't help to start drooling a bit. It's such a shame the ambiance and staff of the Shiraz booth never want to make me order a Shiraz ever again though. It is difficult to place your initial order with T-pain blasting out the speakers. I don't understand how a T-pain music video fits into the authentic Persian brand. I literally have to yell my order, which wasn't a big deal because I was craving it so bad that I was actually fine yelling it, but when I mentioned that the volume could be turned down a bit, the staff made me feel like I was a lame grandpa who only appreciates classical music. Preparing the Shawarma took quiet a while, which gave the staff a good opportunity to shamelessly check out my gf. Unbelievable. Food is still good though :P",

Walking by the stall leaves one's mouth watering - and the sight of the roasted meats compels one to purchase food there. Price wise - it's rather pricey for street food, but considering how difficult it is to find Persian street stalls in Singapore, I doubt anyone will complain. Okay fine, maybe it's not a super authentic street stall, but considering that it's located on Orchard Road, I don't think anyone will fault them for this.",
