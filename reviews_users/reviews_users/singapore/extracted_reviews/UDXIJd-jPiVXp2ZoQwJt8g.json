We decided to have our Thanksgiving dinner at Khansama Tandoori, because we are very thankful for Indian food and we have heard good things about this restaurant. When we first arrived, our server seemed a little unfriendly, but he warmed up to us. I could not remember what palak paneer was called, but he knew as soon as I described it and added it to our order. We also tried the butter chicken, the assorted tandori and the butter and cheese naan breads. Everything was delicious and the atmosphere was comfortable, clean and very nicely decorated. There is also a fairly well stocked bar as well as a descent house white wine. I would happily recommend this restaurant, and only suggest that you prepare to leave very full.",

Or we order in and they deliver for free above 50$. So far we have never been disappointed which is why we eat there and order in so often. Love it! Staff are super friendly and helpful and willing to recommend things especially when they get to know you and your tastes. I am addicted to a few of the dishes, the chilli pakoras (green chillies stuffed with red chillies, battered and fried - heavenly!), the samosas, mushroom mattar (mushrooms with peas), dal, baingan bharta (smoked mashed aubergine) and I could go on as their tikka is great too. I have posted about it a lot on the blog but here is at least one review:mylifeinsin.com/2013/01/\u2026",

My favorite order here is the Chicken Tikka Masala with some Kulcha. The meat is always done just right, lots of flavor in portions that aren't too large, and aren't too small. A portion of curry here would serve two people just about.Recommend:Non Vegetarian:- Chicken Tikka Masala- Mutton Biryani- King PrawnsVegetarian:- Dal MakhniBreads:- Masala Kulcha- Rumali RotiThe service:The staff is very friendly, contrary to other reviews here. Just set up a conversation and remember that this is a very popular restaurant that's packed to the limit almost everyday so they're bound to be a little busyThe chairs:Oh gawd, this is the worst part! They're not comfortable at all no matter what size you are. There's no clearance between the chair and the table so it's a really awkward way to sit. The food makes it up for everything though :)Price:A typical meal for one here without alcohol comes to ~SGD $28 - $35. Remember to pay with \"Nets\" which is a state controlled payment method that has no fees compared to Visa which will tack on a few more dollars ;)",

Very good mughlai pasanda (better than the usual butter chicken which is good in itself). Good Indian food like the one in India. Reasonable pricing too.",

    "text": "Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES. The spice, the flavours, the bustling outdoor seating, the naan (oh god the naan), it was like each and every dish they brought out was better than the last. The menu was a feast in itself - I knew it would be bad (read: really freaking good) when there were 7 types of naan to choose from, but it got to the point where we were all just pointing and shouting and gesticulating wildly. As for the dishes that I dug into? The chicken tikka masala was dark, rich and spicy and the kadahi prawn was easily the best prawn dish I've ever had, but the real stand out was the super decadent chicken mughlayee. It was one of those situations where we wanted everything we saw going out to tables around us, so I doubt you'll go wrong. We were a bit surprised with the relatively high prices and rather slow food service (waiters were attentive, but it just took a reeeeeally long time for our food to arrive) but the second the food came out, all was forgiven and forgotten. All I can remember now is the food korma I had for the next several hours.",

They are very attentive and helpful. \u00a0The order is quickly taken. \u00a0The food comes out quite fast. \u00a0They did insure there was a little staging with the starters versus the appetizers. \u00a0But, like most Indian restaurants, this is a relatively fast paced meal.I thought the food was pretty good. \u00a0My dinner companion thought that it was a bit spicy. \u00a0This included some dishes that are not necessarily usually on the hot side. \u00a0I expect it from a chicken vindaloo but not necessarily from a prawn masala. I actually didn't find it that spicy though.The starters were all quite good. \u00a0I thought the vegetarian samosas, Noor-eh-Elahi, and vegetarian pakora were delicious and also offered nice crisp textures. \u00a0I was less fond of the paneer pakora. \u00a0But that is primarily a person taste issue.tinyurl.com/b6as2wqtinyurl.com/bepc73btinyurl.com/a9xcwkxFor mains to share, I selected chicken vindaloo and prawn masala.For mains to share, she selected palak paneer and palak chicken. \u00a0She thought she had ordered only one dish. \u00a0The ordering was pretty frenzied so I am not sure.I thought the food was very good. \u00a0Lol, I especially enjoyed my two selections. \u00a0 The vindaloo was spicy. \u00a0The chicken was tender. \u00a0The potatoes were well prepared. \u00a0For the prawn masala, the shrimp was also tender and the dish came together quite well. \u00a0I only dabbled a bit with her spinach laden selections.Of course, we also had saffron rice and naan (plain and garlic).I thought the rice was spot on. \u00a0The naan was only average. \u00a0The garlic naan just didn't seem to have that super freshly cooked garlic flavour that really makes great garlic naan great.tinyurl.com/a85z75uReceipt ($114.00):You can't really beat getting that much food for $114.tinyurl.com/a85z75uWe had way too much food and unfortunately neither of us are doggy bag people. \u00a0So, we left a lot of food on the table. \u00a0That was a shame. \u00a0I thought it was some pretty good Indian food.Overall, I like the room. \u00a0The service was good. \u00a0I thought the quality of the food was consistently there. \u00a0I do not think my friend enjoyed it nearly as much. \u00a0For me, it was a solid 3.5 stars but I rounded up.(another note, my first experience was very much in-line with my second visit)",

The food is fantastic and reasonably priced although I'd recommend a party of more than one. Lunch can be pricey if you want to try more than one dish. \u00a0Not complaining at all however, well worth the higher than usual lunch expense. I can't recommend this place more highly. If you find yourself in Singapore, and you like fantastic Indian cuisine, don't skip this place.",

We passed by the first time in hope we would find something better maybe and no cigar. We walked right back. The place isn't much to look at they're under construction. The chairs are lawn chairs but who cares I'm here to chow. We had mutton kebab, chicken tandoori, mutton curry, vegetable rice and roti with a side of white sauce. JUST WOW. Spicy, delicious, savory. My mouth is watering I miss it so much. The staff is a little stand off ish but once you get their attention they're incredibly nice. Food is fast we ordered and ate in a half hour bc we had a tour to catch. I honestly will miss this place the most!",

    "text": "Location: This place is located in Little India, Singapore. When I came here around early/mid April, they were doing construction downstairs, so it wasn't a place I would considered just by looking outside. I came here through Yelp and since I was around the area, thought I'll give it a try. Environment/Service: I had to go upstairs, since downstairs was constructing (so I was told). If you know Singapore, it gets pretty damn hot. It was pretty hot upstairs and it was poorly ventilated. It's a horrible experience when you're sweating so much, yet trying to consume food. It was pretty busy due to the area being a tourist friendly area, but service was slow and waiters were not attentive. Their chairs are so heavy and huge, which makes it so difficult to even get up to use the bathroom. Food: I tried their chicken curry and their jumbo prawns. The chicken curry was okay, meat was too dry and wasn't really my type of curry (I had Indian food before and it was better). Their jumbo prawns did not look like prawns and rather more like regular shrimps. It was also on the pricier side for mediocre food. Their menu is like a book. A lot of choices, but definitely overwhelming. If I remembered correctly, it was about 30 pages or more!Overall, I give this place two stars. Two stars only because maybe other dishes on the menu could've tasted better, but I wouldn't know. Other than that, service was not great, it was too hot to even move, and our food wasn't that great either.",

Seriously people, do yourself a favour, walk around the back to around the House of Tan Tieng, grab a masala milk for $1.50, a plate of Chenna masala for $1.50 and enjoy the tranquility and food which is heaps better.

I ordered it as a starter, ended up getting another order, together with mutton keema naan and sesame naan made a great tandoori meal. \u00a0Half a mutton seekh kebab has sealed the deal!Defiantly coming back. \u00a0This place is good.In the photo comments, I couldn't edit the iPhone \"autocorrecting\" mutton into mitten! :)",

It was a hot and humid day in Singapore so we decided to sit upstairs. They have a lot of items in their menu. It will take you sometime to go through it to make a choice. We ordered starters and main course. Food was good, but it was pricey. Service was quick and the place was clean but nothing fancy.",
