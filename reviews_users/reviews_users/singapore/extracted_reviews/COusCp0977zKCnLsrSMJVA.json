    "text": "I would've given this place s five star rating if their menu is more descriptive of what's inside of each dish.To conclude our Singapore trip, we decided to have a quick dinner close to the hotel. So we stopped by Asia Grand. The restaurant does look grand, and omg they didn't skimp on AC!! It's 90 degrees outside, and they blasted AC inside the restaurant making it feel like it's in the 50s!! Since its so cold inside, we've decided to order some soup to warm up. My soup was pretty good ( I ordered the fish soup with tofu); however, my hubby's soup had some mysterious ingredients that's not listed on the menu. Since he's allergic to shellfish and those ingredients look like shellfish, we decided to not chance it. The waitress told us that we can't return the soup as they already made it. Well, that's not acceptable. In the end, they didn't charge us for it, but we did need to put up a fight for it.Other than that, the meal was very good. Food was tasty and service was good. I recommend the chicken steamed with yellow wine, salt and pepper ribs.",

    "text": "Decent to slightly above average dim sum restaurant located within the City Hall/ Bras Basah / Bugis area. You can't miss the restaurant as it is located right across the iconic Raffles Hotel (North Bridge Road side) \u00a0and in the same building as The Loof - the rooftop bar everyone is raving about. We made reservation 2 weeks in advance just because we have a big group and to ensure we have a table secured for us during the peak brunch / lunch period on a Saturday. Kudos to the team - the table was set up nicely when we reached and the service was prompt. We browsed through the extensive menu and picked a few dim sum staples like har kow, siew mai, liu sar pao, cheong fun and etc. All were decent, nothing spectacular, the standard you would expect from a chinese restuarant. Since chinese new year is just around the corner, we ordered a big plate of \u00a0salmon \"yu sheng\", a raw fish salad to toss in good fortune for the upcoming lunar new year. The 'Yu sheng\" priced at $88 for the big portion was very overpriced looking at the portion and the very thin slices of salmon (2 small plates with 5 to 6 slices/plate) while the rest are just pickled vegetables and crackers. I would pay $50 max but to charge this exorbitant price just because it's in high demand now is just absurd. Lucky, to \u00a0balance things out, Asia Grand do have peking duck promotion ($38 whole duck) and each table is only entitled for single order. We ordered the peking duck as well and it was good. Whole duck was brought to our table where the restaurant captain did her magic, carving the crispy skin and then wrapped in thin crepe to be eaten with hoisin sauce. Delicious! \u00a0The remaining of the duck meat can either be eaten as it is or you can request the kitchen to cook it the way you desire (with noodles or porridge, each with different surcharge, of course)For dessert, we had red bean pancake (\"wor peng\") and glutinous rice ball (mochi) with black sesame filling. Overall, we paid a total bill of $370 to be shared among \u00a013 of us. Asia Grand definitely needs to live up to its expectation and maintain the food standard looking at the tight competition within that area - Wah Lok at Carlton Hotel and Royal China at Raffles Hotel. As at now, I am still not \"very\" convince with the overall dining experience hence the 3 star. COME BACK, I MUST!",

    "text": "This is a respectable established Chinese restaurant. I've been here a few times for family dinner and a few business lunches. The service is professional and experienced.My most recent meal here was a CNY lunch and these are some of the dishes:1) Yusheng. Nicely balanced seasoning. Fresh veg. I really liked the fried salmon skin that was really light and crispy. They DID use some salmon sashimi despite the recent raw fish scare. The crispy crackers were very crunchy and in copious amounts - always a highlight for me to have generous crackers.2) The fish maw super soup - light and not gluey. Some more expensive menus I've had recently seem to have a more gluey consistency which is really too heavy for a lunch with so many courses. This was not bad and quite a lot of fish maw in it but not that special in terms of the soup flavour. Could be a bit more intense.3) Fried pippa duck. Nice crispy bits but some parts of the meat were a little chewy. I had limited stomach space so I left those.4) Fresh prawns in superior stock with tung hoon. Super yummy and tasty! Prawns were fresh and firm. The tung hoon was bouncy and full of flavour like it had absorbed the sauce.5) Abalone - I've had so much abalone the past few weeks at places like Jade, Summer Palace and Szechuan Court repeatedly. This is no worse in quality. Although a slightly smaller size but the other places are more pricey. It was tender and tasty. The sauce was tasty. The broccoli it came with was a bit boring.6) The fish was kinda muddy. We all commented that it was obviously freshwater fish but really the aftertaste was too strong. Disappointing.7) The glutinous fried rice. This was ok only for me. But to be fair, I was really full at this point.8) I enjoyed dessert. Red bean with mandarin peel and a sesame paste glutinous dumpling.I liked that they brought the nian gao straight in the steamers to the table. They had put the fine peanut and icing sugar mixture on the side to serve since one of our group was allergic to nuts. The nian gao was really very smooth and tender and actually stretched a lot when we were picking it up. Usually it would be rolled in the nuts so not their fault. It was quite mild tasting but the texture was really soft.",

    "text": "My family has been a regular at Asia Grand Restaurant for many years. The owners of the restaurant used to work for Tsui Hang Village in Asia Hotel many years ago (must have been at least 10-15 years) and my parents have always been loyal patrons.Asia Grand is your typical better-than-Crystal-Jade Chinese restaurant serving decent ala-carte dim sum for lunch and cantonese style cuisine for dinner. The pricing here is fair, not super high end but not extremely affordable either. Great for family dinners on special occasions!I love the peking duck here as the skin is always nicely sliced and wrapped with the egg skin. When my parents are in the mood to splurg, I also enjoy the geoduck clam/ lobster sashimi/ steamboat. Otherwise, food here can never go wrong, although standards may vary depending on the number of customers/ how crowded the restaurant is.",

    "text": "I am a huge dimsum aficionado and it is often regretful that one can only procure good dimsum at dingy places (eg 126 Web Dou Sik) or nicer places (St Regis). I refuse to comment on Crystal Jade as my earlier statement excludes seemingly mass-produced dimsum.Asia Grand is similar to Jing; it bridges the gap between low-end and pricey. It is a middle ground meal that you will feel comfortable bringing clients of a certain profile to, or a family dinner etc. Make sure you order the liu sha pao - it was the best I have had for awhile. The golden molten was glorious.",

    "text": "An established brand name when it comes to dim sum and chinese cuisine in general, I have had the chance to dine here a couple of times, but somehow i don't think the food is that great. The suckling pig has some sort of a smell that you can still taste, like they didn't clean it properly, which made eating it unpleasant. So you might want to give that a miss. The dim sum menu is really just average, and even sub-par on certain dishes. Long queues are fairly common here so its always good to make a reservation should you want to dine here in large groups.",
