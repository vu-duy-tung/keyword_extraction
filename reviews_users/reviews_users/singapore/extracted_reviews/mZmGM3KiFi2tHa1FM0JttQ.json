    "text": "I've only been to Hawaii once, and it was over 2 decades ago, but thanks to the interwebs and Instagram I have some idea of the yummy food that comes from the island.Although poke is supposed to be a raw fish salad, I wasn't in the mood for fish when I stopped by so I did an unconventional veggie bowl. You have a choice of the team putting something together for you (that they know is good!) or customizing your own bowl.The form is pretty straightforward. I did a salad with a good marinated tofu, edamame and walnuts. If you're eating in, I wish they could give you a top for the bowl so you can mix it up a bit. I found it a bit difficult to eat because all the toppings were on top, it was almost overflowing, and I couldn't really mix my salad.I love the decor, and of course the iced infused water is a great touch! This is definitely a place to visit a little before the lunch rush, because seating is limited and queues are long.",

    "text": "I like Hawaiian food as I find it a fushion between two of my favorite cuisines: Japanese and American so Aloha Poke has been on my to visit list for a while.I came expecting a fully customizable rice bowl with poke but learned that they only serve those during lunch. In the evening this place transforms in an bar/restaurant. The menu looked quite attractive with typical Hawaiian dishes such as Kaluha pig and Loco Moco.Since I was there for the poke I went with the ultimate poke bowl. This dish is probably a spruced up version of their lunch offerings but I was a bit disappointed to hear that you were not allowed to choose the toppings. Anyways, it turned out a-ok, nothing special really.Also worth mentioning is that they had an extensive cocktail list and a dedicated bar tender but I was not in the mood for cocktails so I went for the coconut water which was a nice refreshing touch. I must admit the biggest thing I disliked about the evening menu is the fact that they did not offer free water, the cheapest thing offered is bottled water for 3.90 S$ which I thought was super overpriced!I was doubting between three and four stars but ultimately the take away I flipped it towards a three star review. I am a sucker for spam musubi* so I decided to get this as a take-away even knowing it was 11 S$. The spam musubi was tiny, like miniature spam musubi and the taste not at all like spam musubi so this ended up being a dissappointment. Would return? Maybe for lunch service or maybe to try their version of Loco Moco but I must say I like Little Hiro better for Hawaiian fare.* anyone in the know of somewhere in SG which sells decent spam musubi, please let me know. Thanks!",

    "text": "Meh. Many poke places are starting to sprout up in Singapore, and Aloha Poke doesn't fulfil my expectations of what a poke joint should be. The bowls are small and don't leave a lot of room for mixing. Plus, their poke is overfilling with marinade. It doesn't look appetizing and is too saucy! The worst part? They do NOT spin their salads so the sauce then mixes with the water and ew...! Maybe I'm a snob, but the lettuce is pretty cheap, i.e. they provide local lettuce, you know, the kind used as plate decoration as opposed to consumption. They're also skimpy with the add-ons. It was basically a sprinkle of this and that, which is fine but not worth the price tag or the choice of add-ons. I had a much better experience with Rollie Olie, which better reflects that 'Hawaiian Poke' style I've witnessed in California and Hawaii. Nice try, Aloha Poke, but will probably not be back again.",

With cocktail and mocktail the bill came to more than a $100 for 3. Bit expensive. Plus we were overcharged for the mocktail. Good food but not something that I will go back for again.",

    "text": "When Pasar Bella opened next to my office, one of the first few stalls I tried was Rollie Ollie because I love American fusion sushi. I later tried a poke bowl there and in my mind, it is really a chiraishi don with more lettuce thrown in, some fruit and avo and choice of brown rice if you desire it. With that in mind, I decided to try Aloha Poke since a friend worked nearby and the order chit said each serving of poke (the protein) was 120g....which is awesome if a standard bowl with 2 pokes costs about $16 only. The Aloha Poke version of poke turned out to be pretty lame. The bowls were really small (you get a much larger version for the same price at Rollie Ollie) with the ingredients heaped on top of the rice and lettuce beds. I felt like I was eating each ingredient \"separately\" because it wasn't tossed and if I tried to toss it, I'm sure a piece of pineapple worth $100 would fall out (my joke when prices are really expensive at these hipster joints, for very small portions of imported concept cuisine). The textures and flavors just didn't meld together well. Also, I'm PRETTY certain I didn't get 120g per serving of poke. Meh. Had to eat some hawker food afterwards to avoid gassing out at my boxing class later that day. Stick to the other options in the RP/TP area.",

I put 4 stars because nevertheless it's delicious I consider its a little overpriced (probably because it's in a business location).",

What it turns out to be is a salad bar with a Hawaiian twist. \u00a0So Poke is hawaiian raw fish salad which is basically raw fish cubes (tuna was the one I tried) marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, lime juice, sesame oil and chilli. \u00a0You start with choosing the size of your order which is how much greens you start with as a base, then you pick the protein/poke (there was a choice between tuna and salmon, then you can add toppings of your choice including one \"super-food\", my pick was avocado. \u00a0Kale requires an extra dollar. \u00a0My small sized bowl totalled around S$13. \u00a0It looks small but it was actually sufficient and did leave me feeling very healthy. The poke tasted prettty good and I was pleasantly surprised with the spicy and tangy marinate. \u00a0Price may be a bit on the high side but I do think it's a good balance between healthiness and tastiness. I also like the color theme - blue, relaxing, breezy, light and airy, goes very well with the food. Not a bad place for lunch.",
