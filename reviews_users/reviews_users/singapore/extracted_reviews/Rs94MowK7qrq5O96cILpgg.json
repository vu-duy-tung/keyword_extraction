    "text": "A pretty restaurant decked out in the the premises of a bungalow, how quaint! The setting is elegant, and much pride has obviously gone into the decor and comfortable furnishing. It's a bit of a pity that more people don't patronise the restaurant. Indeed, when I was there for lunch one weekday, there were only three tables filled, including ours. There was a buffet going on at an attractive rate, and we partook in the offer - a rather wide spread of curries, naans, meats, vegetables, biryani and even dessert. Food was well executed even for a buffet standard, and there were vegetarian friendly options. The naans are a little on the chewier side than what I'm used to though. My only other gripe was that the servers were a little too keen to clear off the buffet items on the dot. A quick flip through the menu evidenced that the a la carte dishes were on the pricy side though. I suppose with the addition of wine, your credit card might smoke a little at the end of your meal. Parking is easy, given that there are ample lots around the bungalow (and not many customers around).",

The food has improved tremendously, so much so that I have been bringing colleagues and friends here where many try Indian food for the first time.Both the buffet and their a la carte menu are wonderful. I highly recommend their samosas, Delhi Chaat, Tandoori Prawns and any of their naan. Their chicken tikka masala and butter chicken is quite normal.Their kulfi and gulab jamans are excellent.It is my no means the best or most innovative Indian cuisine out there but it hits the spot for a good meal. Definitely check it out if you are wanting a great Indian meal.",

    "text": "I had booked this restaurant with great expectations as well as with high hopes that this will be our second Michelin Indian dining experience (The first being Taj Campton Place in San Francisco)! I had opted for the veg tasting menu while my husband chose the non-veg tasting menu. The interior of the restaurant is very weirdly oriented and has few private rooms too. I liked the open kitchen concept. There was just one complimentary starter of bread roll which was very bland & definitely not the best taste to keep me wanting for more. The service was very mediocre & definitely not upscale of that a Michelin dining experience. Food was hit or miss, nothing to make me feel wow. They never changed the cutleries nor cleaned the table of the crumbs. I couldn't find any difference of food-taste or style or presentation or service that could justify its Michelin rating. The worst part was to find a dead ant on the rim of the glass where some gravy was served! Although the manager came & apologized, nothing was offered as complimentary to compensate for that worse experience. I have dined in several Michelin restaurants in different parts of the world to state that this could have been a normal Indian restaurant. What I liked was the starter.. which was a mix platter of samosa, veg patties & gol gappas. In the main course, okra fry & daal was good! My husband loved his chicken tikka gravy. In the dessert option, I really enjoyed the beet root halwa. In short, the food can be hit or miss... don't go here with Michelin dining mindset but just an ordinary Indian restaurant. I don't think I would like to return again, there are far better restaurants in this country to enjoy.",

The whole place itself looked very grand and the furniture was great. The lighting was perfect and it just makes you feel rich just by being there. It's set in an old Singaporean Bungalow-ish home so thats pretty unique.Now the food. Was honestly one of the best North Indian food I have ever tasted and that's coming from a South Indian. The food was cooked perfectly and I didn't feel like there was much room for improvement. There were Indian desserts, side dishes, main courses and just being there and eating their food which is so rich in flavor just made you feel like a king. The customer service was great and all the waiters were smartly dressed so I have no comment on that. Only problem is there might be a bit of a jam in the road outside this area but that isn't because this restaurants is well known. It's because it's located in the city area or at least, close to the city area. \u00a0So if you are looking for an Indian Restaurant to bring your partner out on a date, look no further! This restaurant is perfect for the two of you. Although quite pricey, the food is definitely worth it.",

    "text": "I love that this restaurant is in a Black & White house along Scotts Road.The interior is pretty nice but a little too dark when you go for lunch. It felt like I was having dinner and got blinded by the sun when I got out. (Yes, it did not rain that afternoon!)So I decided to have lunch there that day after passing in front so many times. During lunch, they have a buffet so I decided to try it to sample a few of their dishes.The food was just okay. The naam was hard, the vegetables dry, and the meats in the curries not very tender. Maybe the A La Carte is better, but the buffet is not worth trying.",

    "text": "How exciting, Singapore's first Michellen Star Indian restaurant. I went here for Sunday lunch right when they opened. The service was very good, the decor is very upscale and nice. The food was not impressive. The chicken was even a little tough in butter chicken curry. The selection was not very big. As a comparison i found the lunch buffet at Yantra significantly more impressive in the quality, taste and selection. I dont plan on coming back and wonder what Michellen saw in this place.",
