And they'd like you to wait in a line for the honor of paying $31 for a Singapore Sling with the accompanying ambiance of a broom closet.No thanks.Proceed directly across the street to this friendly, proper pub for a Singapore sling at about half the price. Get some great food to nibble on as well.",

I will be back in Singapore a lot and and already looking forward to sneaking away to have a burger here.",

    "text": "Hidden in one of the streets that runs along the back of Raffles Hotel are some really cool hole in the wall bars, in particular this one. Okay, I was looking for another bar but unfortunately that was closed, however this one was just down the road so I decided to check it out. I must say that I am really glad I did because this was one pretty cool bar. In fact it reminded me of some of the cool hole in the wall bars that you have in Melbourne. The staff are absolutely lovely, and the drinks are also quite reasonably priced as well. However I really liked the ambience of this place, while not grungy, still very laid back and relax. My recommend forget Raffles and come around the corner to this place because the drinks are much cheaper, the atnosphere much more laid back, and the staff super nice.",

    "text": "For Singapore prices, reasonably-priced burgers. I reckon they're a medium size: enough to satisfy, but not so much I was left feeling full. The French fries were pretty parsimonious to be honest, but the wedges were a bit more substantial for the price. And we were able to get the toppings on-the-side (American style) with no difficulty, which I thought was good. The burger buns were white sesame-seed buns, toasted nicely, and not just warmed, and so had a satisfying crunch to them. My meat pattie was medium-rare. I would prefer to have a choice and get it medium. Perhaps I did have that choice? But it wasn't an option on the menu and I wasn't asked. Unless I can't count, my double-pattie (super cheesy burger) was only a single pattie. The man taking our orders was pleasant enough, but the lady who delivered our burgers just plonked them on the table with nary a word or explanation of which was which until we asked her.All in all, I'd happily come here again for a burger fix. Only thing to be aware of its that the menu is apparently new, and right now they don't have the salad available.",

Not sure it will live up to Squirrels in Corvallis Oregon, but willing to give it a go. Never lived until you have had a squirrel burger. No, no squirrels had to die.",

The chalkboard is full of specials and happy hour details, and they play American 80's rock like Nirvana.We go for the beer and the burgers. \u00a0The burgers range from $12-$16 and come with fries or onion rings. You can upsize to parmesan truffle fries for $2, which is what I always do. \u00a0There are different variations of burgers, such as-a Mexican burger with chili-the breakfast burger with chorizo and egg-Swiss cheese & mushroom burger (a more conservative choice)The appetizers like the chicken wings also seem very popular. We like it for the casual vibe, the fact that prices are net (no ++ here!), and the happy hours don't end too early. Price is always reasonable when we pay up.Free water for the non-drinkers a plus.",

It's the kind of place where everyone gets to know the affable owners Pio and Adam - likely through a game of beer pong they'll challenge you to - a place where everyone knows your name (Cheers, anyone?). The Messy Mexican Burger (chili bacon burger) is one of my favorite sloppy joe style burgers in town.",
