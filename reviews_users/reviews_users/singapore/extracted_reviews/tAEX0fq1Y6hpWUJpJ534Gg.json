    "text": "Summary: Four stars solely owed to the breads. Drinks are average or slightly below average. Haven't tried food items. I go to church near this place so have come here several times for our small group over coffee drinks. I was not impressed and thought the drinks were so dull and the place was simply not worth my time putting it into a review. But oh boy did today change everything! I had a chance to try their cinnamon bun thanks to my friend and I was in love. Maybe I haven't found too many good bread places yet, but I really appreciated the made-from-scratch, fluffy texture that lived inside the bread with just a dash of cinnamon instead of being smothered with it. (Yes, I am a sucker for such delicacy,) So I wanted to bring back home the bun but the cinnamon bun was already all sold out by the time I left. So I chose milk plait as an alternative and it was also really good. But 3.5/5 goodness, not exactly 4. But again the texture was just so right. Couldn't stop myself from eating almost entirely to continue ripping the bread to its texture.My friend told me that their baguette and ciabatta, rustic bread are all really good. Another good thing about Simply Bread is that the prices are reasonable. Both of my times were around $4,59 each. Will definitely come back for those.",

    "text": "Sticky bun ($1.85) - 5 starsI remember the good old days when Simply Bread first opened along the Singapore river and my runs were interrupted by the smell of baking bread wafting in the air. I would make sticky buns on my own, but for the price (and to avert the temptation of finishing an entire tray), these sticky buns are a fantastic alternative.",

    "text": "Just a place to get different types of bread and rolls if you are living in the area. Nothing special. I do like the sticky bun as not many places have that. It goes very well with a cup of hot tea. The brunch plate was typical with eggs, sausage/bacon and toast. The place is a bit small with some large tables which you could share with other diners as it can get busy with the weekend breakfast crowd. It is fairly quiet in the afternoon, making it a good place to read with a cup of coffee and bun or teacake.",

It really is some of the best bread I have had from anywhere. I often buy the raisin knot as it is a great school/after school snack for the kids. The kids love the ciabatta loafI cant really comment on the coffee or eat in food but highly rate the bread. I buy a prepaid card which gives me 10% off as I regularly purchase from here.",

    "text": "You'll find Simply Bread in a quiet corner of Cluny Court, just past Relish. I'd say it's quite hard to have a craving for Simply Bread, because, true to their name, it's really just simple sandwiches which decent ingredients. Yet I guess it's the setting of the place that makes people come to it. It's really quiet and un-intimidating, good for a quiet read over a sandwich, or a catch-up with friends. What I'd usually get is the Salt Beef sandwich, mainly because it sounded the most unique off the pretty run-of-the-mill menu, and I've also got the Roast Beef sandwich before, which was a fairly dry affair. Granted, they do use rather fresh (home-baked?) bread, but I like them toasted because it makes it crispy and for me that's my favourite part of their sandwiches.If I came back again I'd like to try their Shiitake mushroom sandwich, which does seem quite a treat, and I think is a fairly new item on the menu. Otherwise I'd just stop by for a Sticky Bun, which has always proven to be a real winner with those with a sweet tooth.",

I've been buying bread from simply bread for over 10 years and have never been disappointed. Unfortunately, 4 stars only because tables here aren't cleaned very promptly (perhaps cos it's quite a lean operation) and I was recently there on a hot Sunday afternoon when the ac was not switched on.",

Their menu offering includes an all-day breakfast selection along with classic sandwiches that are generously stuffed. Small bites like the 'Sticky bun' (A must try) are also available if you're craving something to accompany your cuppa. Long communal timber tables layed across raw concrete floors give a homely feel making it the perfect place for a weekend brunch or even late afternoon tea.",

    "text": "Compared to the outlet at Guthrie House, this outlet feels significantly smaller. Perched on the second floor of Cluny Court, what makes this outlet comparably outstanding is the flood of natural light that brightens up the entire space, making the restaurant appear extra pristine. Unlike the Guthrie outlet, however, the way the food is displayed is probably compromised by the smaller space- I'm not sure if I appreciate the fact that the bread counter faces the main corridor, is stacked three segments high and most of the bread just pile on top of each other. I'm not sure if this is the same for the Guthrie outlet, but I had a ridiculous experience once upon a time. My friend and I bought a baguette ($3++) and requested for it to be sliced (it was pretty rock hard), and was told that each slice would cost an additional $1. I have no idea why we decided it was still a good idea to go ahead- probably we were afraid of tearing our teeth out with the bread if we were to dissect it ourselves. Anyway, the eventual cost added up to more than $11.. 300% off the original price, just for the slicing alone. Up till this day, I still cannot decide if we were being ridiculous (I think so) to have gone ahead with it or that the restaurant was ridiculous in coming up with such a surcharge, bearing in mind it was empty when we were and the slicing (by the machine, may I add) took all of 30 seconds. Surely this senselessness cannot be justified by manpower/time.",
