    "text": "Timbre+ as a concept is pretty cool. \u00a0An artful amalgamation of East and West. \u00a0Take a bunch of western-style food trucks serving pizza, American, and French and park them in an airy hawkers center amidst more familiar offerings like a sarabat stall, fishball mee and an aunty hawking fresh fruit juice and cut fruit and you might just have a recipe for something pretty special.Timbre + has a lot going for it, and I do hope that the \"hawkers\" and the management team that had the cajones to put it all together live long and prosper! \u00a0I really do! \u00a0 \u00a0I'm truly happy that someone has the steel tripe to gamble against conventional wisdom and plant a venture like Timbre+ in the middle of what used to be Ayer Rajah Industrial Park. \u00a0The result is, of course, something quite different. \u00a0The feel of the place is not quite urban hip because this isn't Orchard or even the river district, but take a closer look and you find an edgy cool and slightly grungy concept of a location. \u00a0Sit down with a craft beer from the abundantly provisioned Bottle Shop and a consider your surroundings with a more studied eye and you begin to understand that the haphazardness is a facade. Timbre + is a considered, thoughtfully laid out, and well put together concept. \u00a0Take for example the height of the ceiling and the prodigious number of Big Ass Fans that are lazily whirring overhead to keep the entire interior of this, essentially al fresco space airy, breezy and cool without being uninvitingly cave-like. To me, this demonstrates one very important thing. \u00a0The powers that be of this place had the good sense to get the basics right without being totally overwhelmed by their enthusiasm for a fancy concept. \u00a0 This happens all too often in Singapore where you have a totally awesome concept that falls flat on execution because nobody bothered to sit down and sweat the details, things like the ambient temperature, how tables are going to be bussed, and how a capacity crowd could be seated comfortably. \u00a0Kudos, Timbre + bosses!!Put simply, I WANT Timbre + to succeed because success suggests the following:1. \u00a0That more of Singapore will be explored for dining and entertainment. \u00a0You don't have to be downtown to be a success.2. \u00a0Singaporeans are a discerning enough crowd to know a good thing when they see it and are not deterred by unconventional locations.3. \u00a0Unconventional locations = lower rents = more investment in quality. \u00a0If we could only get enough Singaporeans behind this concept, we could all enjoy better quality, more consistency and fewer chain concepts.4. \u00a0The Singapore palate would have the space and the opportunity to mature, become more sophisticated and more discerning. \u00a0Ultimately, this is a good thing. \u00a0More variety, fresher preparations, higher quality ingredients and less reliance on bulk and mass-production is a good and healthy thing.",

    "text": "Idiotic hipster hawker centre.The food here is what you'd find at your random, average hawker stall, except at jacked-up prices.The most annoying bit is the $1 deposit to force you to return your tray. I'm sure that(1) Every diner is happy to pay 5\u00a2 for the service of having their trays returned by some auntie.(2) Plenty of seventy-something year-old aunties (who are currently forced to collect cardboard for a living) are happy to be paid 5\u00a2 for each returned tray. (The above is, in effect, what traditionally has always happened at all eating establishments in Singapore, be it at hawker centres, food courts, or your high-class French restaurant. The 5\u00a2 -- or whatever it may be -- cost is simply implicit in the cost of your food order.)Instead, the timbre+ management decided that to save themselves some money, they'd(1) Place the inconvenience and burden of returning trays on each diner. And:(2) Save money by paying the one-time installation cost of the coin-return mechanism thing (maybe at most a few K), instead of paying some auntie $800 a month to do the job.This money-making scheme can then also be couched under the guise of the stupid and misguided progressive \"returning your tray\" is somehow morally good notion. The hipster fools who love such hipster hawker centres are probably also the same fools who fall sway to such \"progressive\" notions. KNN timbre+ and these hipsters.",

    "text": "What a disappointment! I really wanted to love this place, but I just couldn't...We went at 3:30pm on a Wednesday (because that's when we were hungry). I got the impression many places probably closed around 3pm - over half the stalls were shut. \u00a0Visually, it makes a great impression - there's great street art on the outside, and the combo of stalls and food trucks and art is really cute on the inside. I didn't have any problems with the heat - there was plenty of wind from the million fans they have,The tray return was a highlight, unfortunately, which shouldn't be the case when you're going for food. There are signs everywhere that let you know how it works, so if you insist on wasting your money here, head to the tray return and claim your SG$1 back when you're finished.Food here ranges from \"a bit pricey for a hawker centre\" to \"WTF?! We're not at a restaurant!\" We wound up spending $26 on Indian food that was served mostly *cold*. Not just room temperature, but actually cold. (Shocking, considering how hot it is here - I'm not sure how they managed that.) \u00a0The set meals were a ridiculously large portion of rice with some small scoops of cold vegetables. The butter chicken was a small dish with about 3 pieces of chicken in it, barely room temp. \u00a0The yellow dahl was the best thing we had - it was a nice consistency and good mixture of spices. The masala chai was also good - \u00a0everything else was mediocre and there wasn't much of it... \u00a0we wound up throwing away half of it as who wants to eat cold potatoes on a mountain of rice?The bottle shop looks adorable, but SG$15 for a pear cider and a bottle of water just seemed insane. \u00a0There's free wifi but you have to register with your phone number and a bunch of other info in order to use it so we didn't bother.All in all, we spent SG$42 on what amounted to mostly rice and a little bit of cold food plus a nice cup of tea... I certainly won't come again. \u00a0Go to a proper hawker centre for good food at reasonable prices, or go to a proper restaurant for better food and and the same amount of money.",

    "text": "The place used to house a hawker centre which offered the cheapest priced food in area with fresh fruit juice priced from $1 and rice with 3 sides from $2.50 onwards. I was so sad that the hawker centre was taken away. In its place, now taken over by atas hawker centre called Timbre+, with prices more than double. The place quite hot and humid. So the number one to do when one plan to eat here is to look for a table in front of the huge fans.Do take note that most stalls charge $1 for tray which would be refunded when the tray is returned. So remember do not give the tray to the cleaning uncle when he comes by.The Garcons stall offers french food. Order is taken through the self service machine. Only cash, NETS and NETS flashpay is accepted here. Remember in the number on the pagar which can found next to the machine.BANGERS AND MASH ($16.30).Spanish Chorizo (pork), German Bratwurst (Pork), Chicken Cheese Sasusge (Chicken) served with mashed potato, double mustard and petit saladThe sausages were quite huge. One of the sausages had a taste which was similar to otah.The well known Two Wings also has a stall here. Remember to show that you have a Pokeman Go account, where you will get a lucky dip which could be a discount or a free drink. Chicken Wings ($8.60/ 6 pieces)Topped with chilli crab sauce. Not as eggy as the dish found in most zhi char stalls. The version here was more tangy sweet.Food Anatomy is a stall which offered food such as Nasi Lemak, Salted Egg Prawn on Charcoal Bun in cube forms. We selected 3 items on the display shelves which cost $10.80.Cold SobaThe sauce was in a kind of gel form on top of the soba. The sauce was not bad, but a bit too little and let down by the bland and slightly uncooked soba.Pork LasagneColorful looking with black, green and pink pasta sheets. It was quite moist and tasty.Yuzu Cream with Matcha GenoiseThe yuzu cream was light and refreshing, but melt easily, which helped to keep the matcha cake below moist. Could not really taste the matcha flavour below.",

This place has so much potential but unfortunately fails to deliver.When I came here first, I had high hopes, the place has a cool vibe and looks fun. Also, they have a live band which is always a nice touch, even when the band is soso, because, let's be honest, you're here for the food, aren't you?Uhm... let's just say that once you try the food you start wishing you came for the band. I tried Food Anatomy which serves small dishes in blocks, difficult to describe but very instagramable so I am sure you can find some pics online. It was all about the looks though, we did not finish our dishes and decided to go to the Star Vista to get other food.However, since I liked the atmosphere I decided to give the place another try a few months later. Since I am a big fan of a good Kaisen Don I tried out Teppei Daidokoro. Again... fail: it does not compare to the other branches of Teppei, the fish was slightly warmish (for raw fish?) and had only salmon with the tiniest sprinkle of ikura. My friend had a po-boy from Big Bern's American Grill and mentioned that Louisiana should ban these people for insulting their signature dish!I would describe this place as a hipster hawker centre gone wrong but according the website it is a gastropark - to each their own I guess, but not for me.",

    "text": "New Timbre concept in Singapore, and yay I've always been a Timbre fan since 2010!TImbre has been known for \"Home for Singapore Musicians\" when they first started out. We decided to visit timbre+ for TGIF with zero expectation. My group of friends, 4 of us, arrived at 9pm. We noticed that the space is huge with ample of seats available to host large groups of people. It was fully packed with people at that time, music level is high with the band (Supersonic) on Friday night and a pretty warm location despite huge fans spinning on top of our heads.Within minutes, we were able to find ourselves seated in a comfortable position enjoying the music brought to us by local band. Particularly I love the female lead singer from Supersonic, whose energy level was really high with her singing and dancing on stage. Towards the end of their 2nd set of the night, the male lead singer came down the stage and engaged the audiences with friendly handshake and singing together with the audiences. I thought it was really perfect performances for the night!We split up and got ourselves some food for sharing. We ordered food from Chit Chaat Chai, Teppei Daidokoro, Kush and Two Wings. There are too many stalls to explore and try within one night, so I'm sure this entices multiple visits to this place! We had a papdi chaat from Chit Chaat Chai, a popular indian snack/street food in India - a dish mixed with yogurt, mini papadum, some mint and indian spices. A mixed platter of yakitori from Teppei Daidokoro, salted egg yolk fries, luncheon fries and skewers from Kush, and salted egg yolk wings from Two Wings. Good thing that the salted egg yolk from fries are separated in a bowl from the fries, we did not get sick over 2 dishes of salted egg yolk in one night. The food selection is really great with so many options to choose from! The only dish I dislike for the night are the skewers from Kush, should just stick to Teppei next time.Now, Timbre is known for their beer and pizza. Beer selection was a total disappointment from this space, and the purchase takes a very long time. There is no sight of Timbre pizza too. There are fridges stocked up with craft beer only, and Archipelago draft on tap. I was hoping to get a tower of beer for all my friends for sharing, but nope, no tower available. I guess there is something they could do about to the payment of beer purchase for sure. There is only 1 counter for payment. Well, but I'm pretty cool with everything, because there's so much other positive stuff over this beer counter.We spent less than $40 per pax for the entire night with good food and entertainment. It's quite worth it with a bunch of friends to chill out. Cab home is problem. We can barely find any cab on the road, so we walked over to the main street and waited a while before we can get home. It's also a great space for family too! I saw really small babies in the arms of mummies, and they are not crying babies!On the other hand, we spotted normal hawker stalls on our way out, like fish soup, fruit juice, handmade noodle stalls etc. We also notice the graffiti sprayed outside the container, all done by local talents. \u00a0It's an exciting space with a lot of local flavour, which I give it 5 stars! However, in Singapore, you probably still need some cooling space... or awesome cold beers. I'll be back for more, and I'm so glad and proud that Timbre came up with such awesome space!",

At first I was surprised to see that many of the stalls nearer of the street were closed, many of them being local food. As you draw deeper into the warehouse like place, you'll see the stage for the live band and more food options. On a Wed night, about half of the stalls were often, most of which were non-traditional options (ie: French, Indian Kati rolls, Spanish tapas). I ordered a French Onion Soup from the French stall and a Chicken Kati Roll from the Indian stall. My friend tried the Japanese rice bowl and Salted egg fries from Kuchi. \u00a0Sadly I was underwhelmed by all 4 items we had on our shared table. There was a live band who sung Bohemian Rhapsody during our dinner. The fans created a surprisingly well ventilated and casual \u00a0atmosphere, but the food was unimpressive and not cheap. It was fun to check it out to see what the hype was about, but I don't see myself coming back very often, given how mediocre the food was.",

    "text": "Damian D'Silva is back, and his mini-restaurant within Timbre+ will make his fans (like me) happy. Lucky me that I work upstairs! His classics like nasi lemak are still delicious. $8 for a nasi lemak, you say? But there's a whole fish in there! Sharing Damian's place is the cute little coffee kiosk, Blue Collar Collaborative. Friendly baristas. Dusk by Slake offers some well-priced and delicious meat roasts. Order by the grams. Douglas' fishball noodles are above average. \u00a0Not every day you see a 20 something year old Singaporean making his own fish balls. Clams ban mian is comforting especially on a rainy day. Add extra roasted chilli! The bottle shop is well stocked. American modern craft beer heavy with some Japanese (Baird beer, delish) and uk/aussie beers (which I mostly hate). Some ciders.",

    "text": "was at their opening night and the place is the new happening for west-siders.For those who are not aware, this area is the 'Silicon Valley' for startsups.My old incubation agency was located there and wah lao, now I'm gone, such a haps place happened!I was the only one dining while my partner stole my food.Was ravished and went for the no-queue Chit Chaat Chai, had fish bryani and it was MAAADD awesome. Fragnant and well-cooked, definitely a must-order.There's quite a variety of foodstalls here, and in numerous media outlets, they have been featured. i would like to point out that a few hawker stalls from the previous food centre has stayed, but did not checked out the price hike(if any).Some of my friends were worried that the place looked stuffy but well-assured it was well-ventilated.This is an exciting period whereby relevant start-ups could possibly collaborate with Timbre+.* They have an interesting system whereby you get a dollar back when you return your tray.",

    "text": "Timbre+ is a cool concept where the place operates as an affordable hawker centre during the day and transforms into a great chill out spot with live music at night. I went for dinner as I heard that it is super crowded and hot during the day. There is no air conditioning but I felt comfortable with just fans at night. It is within walking distance from one north mrt station. The front part is made up of hawker stalls which are mostly closed at night. Once you walk in, you are greeted by colorful food trucks and a vibrant scene. The live music started at 8 plus and was impressive. Food wise I had duck confit from Gar\u00e7ons. The meat was tender and the serving was value for money. One friend had a bak kut Teh set which included drinks and was a good deal. Another friend had sashimi which was only so-so. We also shared fries with salted egg sauce which was addictive. We didn't try alcohol but there seemed to be a decent selection. Another cool thing is how the tray return area has a censor and returns you one dollar for each tray. Overall, I would highly recommend Timbre+ as an enjoyable place to hang out with friends without burning a hole in the wallet.",
