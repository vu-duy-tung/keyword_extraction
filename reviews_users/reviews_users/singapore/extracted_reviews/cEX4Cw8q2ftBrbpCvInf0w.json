They finally expanded the restaurant to double units.This place is very popular with tourists and locals \u00a0who love to try their famous xiao long bao and guo tie. They have a limited menu but the food is pretty good. The only thing is the service here is rather bad. Well, you got to put up with their bad attitude to enjoy the great eats. \u00a0In fact, many often refers the owner to be a food nazi.I love their pan fried guo tie, zha jiang mian and pan fried red bean pancake.",

I have been past this a lot of times, and figured 8pm on a Tuesday night there would be zero queue - I was wrong, but it was only four people, so we got a table in less than five minutes.They only have 15 items on the menu, and having read up on what to try earlier, we oredered a handful of things. First up was their signature dish, the Little Juicy Steamed Dumplings (7 for $7.50) which were great on their own, and amazing with a little sauce and ginger. Second, was the Noodles with Sliced Pork and Sichuan Vegetable ($5.35) that was very average, with overcooked noodles and less pork than at a bris. Third up was the Hot and Sour Soup ($3.20) which was spectacular, probably one of the best I have ever had, so delicious. Finally got a Tiger Beer ($9.60/ lg bottle) which was unusually frosty.It is a pity the Chinese Pizza was not available, worth trying next time. If they can also add-in the GST to the prices, it would make it a bit more honest.",

    "text": "I can understand the appeal of this place, but I can't say that I am blown away by the dumplings. BUT, I can understand why this place would appeal to some. Their steamed xiao long baos, and pretty much all kinds of dumplings have the same shrimp pork filling, which has a delicate seafood sweetness to it, especially in the xiao long baos. This taste is distinctly lighter than the taste offered in places such as din tai fung or paradise dynasty, so you don't get the \"urgh too much pork oil\" kinda fullness at the end of the meal. Noteworthy is their minced meat noodles. Very starchy, very flavorful, and I love the chinese spinach that comes with it. Also, their ginger is sweet and tasty, and the vinegar has a hint of sweetness that I like. Last, but definitely not least, the red bean pancake was delicious. The crust is slightly crispy and sticky (think fried nian gao), and the red bean is not overly sweet. Just nice. Yum!",

    "text": "I want to come back to try the chinese pizza and pan fried dumplings (aka fried food...) The other couple sitting at our table recommended the pan fried guo tie over the xiao long bao (!!)Anyway, thankfully we got here somewhat early and didn't have to wait. We did have to share a table though, but that turned out for the better! More on that later.Ordered:1. Xiao long bao ($7.50) - had heard so much about these famed dumplings and so had to try them! What was amazing was that the skin was really springy/chewy and did NOT break, nor was there much fear that it would! This is very very rare. Quite a bit of soup inside, bf remarked that it is a lighter taste than one would find maybe at Din Tai Fung or something. Later he expounded upon this saying that if you eat it at one gulp, there's more flavour. 2. Zha Jiang Mian - pretty good, but nothing mind-blowing. Quite addictive though!3. Red bean pancake aka guo bing ($9) - here is where our lovely table companion couple came in. They had ordered one (whereas we'd waited to place the dessert order, just in case) and it looked pretty big, with 14 pieces I believe. I very much doubted that the bf and I would be able to finish one on our own (nor would it be a very good idea), and these deep fried things are just never as good reheated. Especially without the aid of a toaster oven! So, I nudged the bf to ask if they'd consider sharing it (since I also doubted they would be finishing it on their own). He did ask, and they said okay! Yay :) I didn't like it so much, it was really crispy on the outside but rather chewy on the inside (this, the bf liked - he likes chewy stuff). I would've just preferred more crisp. Anyway, it just led me to realize that their specialty seems to be making things chewy (read: the dumpling skin, the pancake skin). Back to the pancake - it had substantial red bean filling which wasn't too sweet, that's a plus!As another Yelper mentioned, compulsory $1.60 tagged on for the wet towels and peanuts (non-returnable because they don't charge service charge).",

    "text": "On a hot day in Singapore, I decided to venture out into the world, barely avoiding heat stroke. To be honest, I wasn't that hungry but I didn't want to let a minute go to waste since I don't make it to SG that often. I was staying in Chinatown and had arrived earlier that day, so I figured I would eat close to my hotel in case the sun became too much.Chinatown is full of shops and dumplings. Unfortunately, it is also full of tourists.I did my best to avoid tourists and found a small dumpling shop hidden behind a construction zone. I figure the construction zone is not usual because the the shop, Jing Hua Xiao Chi, had been featured multiple times on various \"Best Dumplings\" lists. Okay, so it wasn't the hidden gem I was hoping for but it was definitely not riddled with tourists and that was good enough for me!The walls were red and tastefully (pun intended) decorated with photos of dumplings. Overall the shop was small and fairly empty. I didn't spot a single tourist out of the three groups that were in the restaurant. The staff was nice and sat me quickly and a menu and ordering pad were waiting for me at the table.I was running short on cash and Jing Hua didn't take cards (for the amount I spent.) Fortunately, the dumplings weren't too expensive. After entering the shop, I immediately looked at the menu to see what drinks they had. I needed something refreshing after a short walk that seemed to take an eternity. I noticed they had a Mango Juice on the menu for $3 ($2.20 USD) and I went for it. It was more than I would prefer to spend on a drink but this kind of stuff goes for $10 in California, plus I was desperate.I wanted to check every box on the menu but remembered the minimal cash I had in my wallet and decided to go with the classic Xiao Long Bao for $8 ($5.88 USD) an honest steal compared to SF prices. I've had many a Xiao Long Bao and part of me wanted to try one of the pan fried dumplings, but alas, I decided to play it safe and go with a fan favorite.The Mango Juice was just what I needed. It was refreshing and slightly thick. If it wasn't made of real mango it certainly had me fooled. There was an odd touch of rose water but it grew on me and I downed the whole thing pretty much before the dumplings came. I don't even like mango, but I liked this.Not long after the Mango Juice arrived, a plate of steaming-hot dumplings was placed right in front of me. I was so excited but slightly nervous because I didn't want to be disappointed by this apparently-famous dumpling house. The classic soy/vinegar dumpling sauce was already on the table so I poured myself a saucer-full and placed a single dumpling into the saucer to soak and cool a bit.What happened next was incredible. The dumpling was still hot but I couldn't wait any longer. I put it in my mouth and felt the soup flow in my mouth as I chewed. It was a mix of soy, vinegar, pork juices and sesame. I think the sesame part was pretty unique but maybe that's just how they do it in Singapore. Whatever the reason, I am happy they discovered this combination of flavors because it was a true delight and I would definitely go back.I wolfed down the seven dumplings, walked up to the front of the shop and paid. In case it wasn't clear, I was one happy customer.If you spend enough money, they take Visa. Pay at the front.Total Cost: $13.30 ($9.77 USD)21 Neil RdSingaporeThis post is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews",

They don't skimp on the fillings, hence, the hefty price tag. The zhajiang mian (black bean noodle sauce) is nothing to rave about...it's a bit bland, actually. The veggies are also very simple: stir-fried in garlic but $8 for a small portion. Come here if you're really, REALLY craving old-style, mama homemade kind of dumplings. Otherwise, I think the dumpling places found in Maxwell or Chinatown would suffice. For half the price tag. Don't forget, this place is cash only. Boo. Last time I went, we had to dig into our pockets and return the wet napkins ($0.80 a pop) bc we didn't have enough cash. We paid more than $50 for two pax...was that worth the AC and juicy, pork, veg-gy dumplings? Maybe....",

I never walk along this side of Neil Road but one Sunday in search of food or anything even open worth trying around this area, I stumbled upon Jing Hua. It was open, air conditioned, and there wasn't a crowd so I thought I'd give it a try.I was surprised at the number of Yelp reviews mostly raving about Jing Hua. I cracked up as I read through a number of the reviews while ordering and eating my meal. I especially cracked up at Ida's review as there was a twist to the ending where she ordered all that food for herself! I did the same and didn't feel bad about it after seeing her review, haha.The xiao long bao are very good. On par with DTF I'd say. I really enjoyed my hot and sour noodle soup. It's just like regular hot and sour soup but with a nice thick udon-y noodle to help balance out soup with some carbs.The lotus pancake was awesome also. Not the healthiest as it's deep fried but the skin was crispy to perfection and the lotus inside was subtly sweet and added a good gooey texture to go with the crispy skin. I took half home for breakfast the next morning and although not as good fresh, it was still semi-crispy and enjoyable.I'll be back Jing Hua!",

    "text": "Today at Qun Zhong (aka Jing Hua), I told myself a real whopper of a tale. \u00a0Like a serial cheater tell his or her lover, \"Don't worry baby, I'll never step out on you again\", I told myself, \"Go ahead and over order, don't worry, not like I'm going to finish everything...\"Yeah...you can imagine how that actually went over once I tasted the awesome food. \u00a0First up were the Xiao Long Bao ($7 for an order of 7). \u00a0They were so juicy and delicious with such delicate skins that I rationalized that it would be a crime against all things tasty if I tried to reheat them at home. \u00a0I particularly enjoyed biting off the tops, slurping some of the soup, and stuffing each with the homemade chili sauce on the table.Next were the Fried Dumplings ($8 for 10), which were daintily small, blissfully crispy and curiously open on both ends. \u00a0I recently read an article in the NY Times on the science of junk food, highlighting the research done by food scientists. \u00a0One of the findings was that the \"perfect break point\" in chips is ~4 pounds of pressure per square inch. \u00a0The crispy dumpling bottoms must be pretty darn close because I felt entirely blissed out with each crunchy chew.I ordered the Bean Sprouts with Minced Meat Sauce ($8 for a decent sized plate) as a healthier substitute for the noodles with minced meat sauce that I actually wanted, but it actually turned out to be a great choice. \u00a0The bean sprouts were simply blanched to retain the natural crunchiness and the minced meat sauce was rich and flavorful.To close out my gluttonous solo feast, I ordered the Lotus Paste Pancake ($9). \u00a0I vastly prefer lotus paste to red bean and this pancake massively exceeded my expectations. \u00a0Truth be told, I wasn't sure what it would taste like aside from the rave reviews from my fellow yelpers. \u00a0Picture a thick layer of filling (red bean or lotus paste) sandwiched between two layers of mochi with a deep fried crust on the outside and then sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. \u00a0Don't be shy to fight for the corner pieces if you are with a large group...they are by far the best!PARTING THOUGHT: I showed at 5:50p on a Sunday and there was no line! \u00a0Service was a breeze and the manager was wreathed in smiles and encouraged me to visit again soon!",

    "text": "I have found dumpling nirvana. \u00a0These steamed or fried dumplings are among my favorite dumplings anywhere (the meat is pork though so keep that in mind unless you get the vegetarian version!)You'll exclaim \"Just one more dumpling\" and eat five...but they are worth it.This small menu doesn't give you many options besides dumplings, noodles, vegetables, and two desserts. \u00a0But my oh my, what they do they do DELICIOUSLY! \u00a0The decor is surprisingly modern and clean. \u00a0While they supposedly take reservations, the staff will look clueless when you ask for your reserved table. \u00a0But luckily it doesn't get too packed and a few tables were still available on a Sunday at lunch time.The food:The regular steamed dumplings are simple, but contain a great balance of flavors (not too salty with a great balance of filling to dough). \u00a0The fried dumplings are open at each end and are crispy little pockets of goodness. \u00a0Another crispy piece of goodness is the Chinese pizza which is essentially the pork filling in a large sesame bun - mmm, did I just order a dumpling on steroids? \u00a0The soup dumplings are delicate and flavorful while the vegetarian dumplings had a mild, but nice combination of vegetables. \u00a0I thought the two noodle dishes - the cha jeong noodles and shanghai style with pork strips and preserved vegetables were consistently good, but not the best noodles in town. \u00a0The red bean in sesame pancake was also a surprising favorite. \u00a0I loved the crispy, thin layers over the warm red bean paste.I'm really glad I came here with a group and got to try most dishes. \u00a0It only took me one visit to convince me that this is one of the best dumplings places in town. \u00a0I'd readily eat all of the dumplings again...and happily accept the dumpling food coma thereafter.",

    "text": "Oops...the skin of the Xiao Long Bao broke apart as I attempted to pick it up very cautiously, and the beautiful guts spilled out uncontrollably onto the parchment paper. This is both a good and bad sign; the good thing is that the skin is delicate and the bad sign is that I am too rowdy with this plump meaty babies.These \u00a0Xiao Long Baos ($7++ for 7pcs) are near perfect--the ball of minced pork at the center, loose and yielding, as if itself in midmelt. My 2nd XLB landed in my spoon intact and buoyant, and I popped the entire thing comfortably in my mouth. There could be a little more of that liquefied pork gelatin but I'm just being greedy. Other dumplings variations include the steamed vegetarian dumplings stuffed with taupok bits and crunchy turnips which even non-vegetarians will delight. The Seafood and Pork Dumplings had a slightly chewy feel but the ingredients tasted fresh and not too greasy. I prefer the pan-fried version ($8++ for 10 pieces) which transformed the original chewy skin into delicate crunchy bites with tantalizing burnt aroma. This gives the pan-fried dumpling more character, as if it was a \u00a0golden pillow case Perfect if there were more chives. The mastery achievement goes beyond the dumplings to the noodles and the desserts. The Noodle with Minced Pork & Soya Bean Sauce \u70b8\u9171\u9762 ($5++), is wonderfully alchemized by the minced pork and age-old calculus soya bean paste that Iess salty than other specimens. The Osmanthus soup with glutinous rice ball soup ($3++) arrived hot and fragrant with warm floral inhalations. Hand-made with a spot-on dough-to-filling ratio, each tiny pop is rolled with a different flavour; lotus and walnut, black sesame, red bean and peanuts. \u00a0Another must-try is the Crispy Red Bean Pancake ($10++) that is prepared freshly upon order. Expertly deep-fried till they are like crunchy fritters, the dark brown parcels oozes dense, sweet red bean paste with charred sesame aroma. After such a satisfying meal, I am convinced that the Han's decision to leave the menu unchanged for 25 years was a right one. Consistent quality food that can stand the test of time. Sounds unbelievable in our modern age but here is a true story.",

    "text": "An institution along Neil road, Qun Zhong has recently been renovated and now occupies two unites. The service has improved substantially and almost everyone on the service team comes across as polite - a huge change from before! However, the legendary grouchy elderly man at the door is still there and continues to handle crowd control with impatience and a frown.This one of those restaurants with an extremely small menu, and even then there are overlaps between dishes because sauces and fillings are re-used. However, by focusing on just a few, they've really boiled it down to the dishes they've best at and famous for, and everything is absolutely delicious, although I am not a fan of the Chinese pizza. The xiao long bao are not as dainty and refined as the ones you would find elsewhere, but they are hearty and pack great flavour. My personal favourite dish, however, is their pan-fried dumpling. The skin is delightfully crisp, and this goes well with the vinegar and ginger, too. End the meal with the red bean pancake - totally worth saving a little space in your stomach for.",

    "text": "I had a really unusual experience at Jing Hua tonight. We arrived for dinner at 7pm (on a Tuesday night) and there was no queue. In fact, half the tables were gloriously empty. I had been told there would be a wait at all hours, bad service but the most ridiculously delicious dumplings in Singapore. Well, the service was actually decent and attentive by both Singapore and authentic Chinese restaurant standards (I can't say which is supposed to be worse). I didn't encounter the grumpy boss and we were seated immediately.We ordered the xiao long bao, guo tie, spinach with oyster sauce, zha jiang mian and red bean pancake. The xiao long bao was as it should be, meaning perfectly hot with lots of soup inside and a good amount of pork and seafood. Divine. The guo tie was similarly awesome - fried to crisp but served on a dry plate with none of that leaky oil puddle crap you get at alot of la mian hawker stalls. The spinach dish was generous and not salty at all and the zha jiang mian, oh what mian. Soft noodles, bowl-lickin' sauce and a good dash of crisp cucumber shreds and spinach.There was nothing bad to say about our experience (well maybe the $0.60 I had to pay for unused wet towels that couldn't be returned) and I intend to return many more times. Considering how a lot of the clientele is Japanese (I still haven't figured out why), \u00a0I'm surprised the food is priced so reasonably. This restaurant definitely goes on my places-to-eat-regularly-when-I-run-out-of-adventurous-fuel.",

Make sure you don't tear the skin until the xlb is safely nestled inside your soup spoon. Once it's in your spoon, gently tear a small opening in the skin to release the soup into your spoon and enjoy the soup before eating the rest of the dumpling. Watch the rest of the diners to see what they do and you should be fine!",
