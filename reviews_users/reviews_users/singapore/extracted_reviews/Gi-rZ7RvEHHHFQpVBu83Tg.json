    "text": "We came here on a Wednesday night for dinner. Reservations are awkwardly timed, either between 6-6:30pm or 8:30-9pm. We walked in slightly past 8pm, and there were seats. Given the reviews, I expected Moosehead to be an innovative type of small plates place. We ordered the olives, the tzatziki and pita, roasted asparagus (daily special), roasted cauliflower, fried artichoke, fried pig's ears, bone marrow on sourdough, and the braised beef cheeks. Our food was served in that order too, one plate at a time. I'm not sure if the chef decided on an order, or it just came out that way. Everything was well cooked, although most dishes seemed a little incomplete. But at the very reasonable prices they are charging, experimental dishes are okay.Someone mentioned below that the food was salty. That review was from a while ago. I barely tasted the salt, even on dishes that can be expected to be salty. On hindsight, the chef's Australian background is very obvious in the food he makes -- a friend describes Australian cuisine as big on good produce, and letting the flavors speak for themselves. In the US, they call it Californian cuisine. Despite the effort to be creative, the chef tends towards classical and traditional flavors, a cosy instead of a surprising taste.The olives were marinated in citrus zest, which was a first for me. They were green olives, so they were milder, but I thought they were the mildest olives I have ever tasted. The tzatziki sauce had a strong dill flavor, and was chunkier than I am used to. It also tasted quite mild. I really enjoyed the flatbread.The roasted asparagus was perfectly done, served with a soft boiled egg and a puree of something (can't remember the menu). It was perfectly flavored and balanced. The roasted cauliflower was a large fist of caulifower, better roasted on one side than the other. The sauce contained miso, and other creamy things. The sauce was interesting, and went nicely with the roasted cauliflower, although it overwhelmed the cauliflower. It could have gone as nicely over potato. The fried artichoke was crisp on the outside, and flavorful on the inside, served with ricotta cheese and bits of random leaves. I think the ricotta went well with the artichoke, but the leaves didn't quite bring enough crunch to freshen up the dish (if that was the intention).The fried pig's ears were supposed to be spiced, but it didn't quite taste of anything strongly. It didn't have too much of a pork flavor, in case you were worried. It's served with a sauce that looked like mayonnaise, but tasted a lot lighter. While I thought it was good, the dish was lacking a certain oomph -- I think it would have been great to have the ultra crisp pig's ears with sauce and some kind of a shredded vegetable, like a slaw or even kimchi to bring a different texture and flavor to the dish.The bone marrow came on perfectly toasted sourdough bread, mixed in with anchovies and celeriac, all chopped up so you can't tell what you're eating but it all goes delightfully together. Despite the addition of anchovies, it wasn't too salty, and had only the faintest hint of the sea. This was probably my favorite dish in terms of complexity and flavor. I highly recommend it. The beef cheeks were nicely braised, and a good sized portion. It was well done, but lacked complexity. All in all, it was a fun dinner, more challenging than the usual restaurant in Singapore, especially at the price point. I enjoyed analyzing and thinking about my food, which doesn't happen often. It's a good restaurant that makes you stop and think about what you're eating, and appreciate the care that the chef took in creating the food.",

This is a small plates sort of place, so order a few plates to share.I like, like, LIKE the bacon-wrapped dates here, aka devils on horseback. They are beautiful together, with pine nuts sprinkled on top. Oh, YUM! The rest of the starters like the crispy pig's ears, garnered more positive vibes with my friend than me.The asparagus is really good too, what can I say? We had the chargrilled sea bass with eggplant, and while I didn't love the sea bass, it was a large portion, and the eggplant accompaniment was pretty yum. This place does everything pretty well. Not many dishes are winners, but I like that nothing on the menu is terrible, but instead more than passably good. Does well to cater to a group!",

Followed by cauliflower and the chicken and ended with the beautifully cooked flank steak. Well done Moosehead !",

    "text": "Ok, let's set things straight first. First of all, I adore this place. It is one of my favorite places for eatery around the area. Not only is it creative in its offering, the ambiance of the place, quietly tucked in the corner of the street all comes together for an authentic food experience. But why is it 3? I don't know WHAT was going on this past Monday, but the service was wayy too slow. I know good food takes some time to be completed, but the service was borderline unbearable. Only because I really like Moosehead, I gave a 3, not 2. Also, the food that night was not as good as most other days I've visited. Bacon-wrapped dates- Must-have for first visitors. When I first heard of the name, honestly it wasn't too appetizing. But boy, was I wrong to underestimate the potential in dates. Extremely well-done combination of flavors (salty + creamy) \u00a0and texture (bacon + softness in dates--almost taste like sweet potato filling). But even this was a bit salty for this night. \u00a0 Tzatziki with bread- Because the service was unbearably slow, we decided we'll order something that they walked passed us with, which looked good. Thus Tzatziki. I always judge the bread provided by the restaurant, whether complimentary or main. It comes across to me as the restaurant caring about the complete food experience, not compromising in quality and integrity of their food even at the very basic --which is bread. With that being said, I was impressed with the bread. But the Tzatziki, not so much. Salty--again. Beef tartare - I've had beef tartare in many places. The portion was rather generous (given that this is a tapas place) and the raw beef was well-seasoned and went extremely well with the crispy goodness. My favorite dish of the night. Bulgogi Chicken - Another classic at Moosehead. The name doesn't describe the taste too well, actually. (Me being Korean, can say it resembles nothing of Bulgogi) But it's really good. Again, on the salty side on this night. Iberico- Oh so well-done. This took the longest time, but so well-done, my friend. The sauce was good, the meat with the sauce was beautiful. Well-done. All in all, it was a disappointing night at Moosehead. Perhaps because I had high expectation, but then again, I don't think I would have been too impressed if I were a first time visitor that night, who didn't have any expectation.",

I can safely say the food in this place does not disappoint.At lunch, i had their double cheese burger with onion and pickles. It was one of the best burgers in Singapore (though very messy to eat).For the tapas, we tried beef tongue which was a nice surprise - it's tender and served with a nice tomato sauce with some sort of nut in it, which makes the texture crunchy. We also tried the grilled cauliflower which came with this awesome tangy (lemon?) sauce.Recommended.",

    "text": "Alright - this place needs more love. It's conveniently located, across the street from Telok Ayer MRT and a perfect hideaway to unwind in for after work drinks. We managed to walk in at around 7 with no reservation - probably a different story on weekends, so be sure to make one just in case! The only downfall is that the service is a little slow and if you're not into splashing the cash out for typical tapas sized portions, then maybe you won't see the value in coming to Moosehead. I had my doubts, because I could just fill up on $3 Char Kuey Teow, but hey - I was sold on that sizeable platter of Crispy Pig's Ears. Perfect for sharing between two, super crunchy and a perfect bar \"entree\". Don't leave without trying the Beef Tongue with Parsley and Butter - it's pricey considering it's an off cut and an exceptionally small portion, but the flavours make it well worth it. This is definitely a tapas bar worth trying!",

    "text": "Of course after reading reviews about the poor service I expected sub par treatment but surprisingly there was excellent Service ( must have improved with all the reviews of poor service). When we arrived, we were greeted promptly and seated 15 min earlier than our reservation. After deciding on what to order, a waitress waiting patiently near the kitchen took the order and within 15min the food was already arriving( Pork scratchings with beef tartare- highly recommend). An additional order of pita bread was ordered and it came out within 5 min to go with the beetroot and Burrata, which was good but nothing to write home about, I'd definitely skip that the next time I come. The Flat iron steak and potatoes came next and were also both excellent. and Finally the Greek Donuts and my gosh I could three more orders of this, light and cripy pockets of dough with honey, creme fraiche and chopped hazelnuts. wow. All in all, I'd recommend Moosehead. My date and I had 5 plates to split between us and I have to say that was quite filling, definitely nicely portioned Tapas. The ambiance was cozy and intimate, perhaps a little packed for a Tuesday Night, but it definitely goes to show that the food is worth coming in for",
