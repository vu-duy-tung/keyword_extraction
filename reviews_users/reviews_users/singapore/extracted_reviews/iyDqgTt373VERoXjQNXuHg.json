    "text": "Brunch place in Bukit Timah. Had the signature mushroom on toast here and it did not disappoint. I got a huge slice of sourdough bread with an overflow of mushroom in white wine cream sauce topped with parmesan cheese. The dish was creamy, rich and delicious. The mushroom texture really goes well with the texture and creaminess of the sauce. While it could easily be too rich / heavy to be enjoyable beyond a few bites, this wasn't the case. I managed to finish the whole dish despite not being a fan of super creamy stuff. The only letdown is probably the bread which was a bit chewy to begin with and gets worse over time as it becomes too soggy from the creaminess of the mushroom. My friend had their other famous dish - the pancake - which was fluffy and as sinfully good. Would recommend checking it out.",

Pay as you order at the counter. Low & Slow Pulled Pork (S$20+)Braised pulled pork, scrambled eggs , streaky bacon , arugula served on sourdoughThe serving was huge. The pulled pork was topped with curry like sauce, quite tender and savoury but a tab too salty on its own. The bacon was a tab salty too. The scrambled eggs was creamy. The arugula was lightly dressed. The sourdough was soft which I like best.White Cold Brew (S$7+)Recommended to have the drink \u00a0without ice cubes so that one can taste the chocolatey notes more easily. Although it was non sweeten, it was not bitter in taste.Overall the food was not bad. The crowd started to come in at around 9am, so best came early.",

I expected more of a coffeehouse vibe but it was definitely more of a mix of that and a restaurant - some people are doing work on their laptops and some people are eating some damn good looking food. You even sometimes need to be seated by a hostess as if it is a restaurant, but you order at the counter.The attitudes of the staff is beyond friendly and I love it. They love being there and it makes me love to be there too. The coffee is good and they have much variety which keeps it fun.Highly recommend if you are in the area and need a lively place to be to yourself, catch up with friends or even have a meeting.",

The place was nicely crowded with young locals, and the staff was friendly and attentive. I very much liked the vibe and decided to have something to eat besides a cup of coffee. \u00a0I ordered salmon soba noodle, and everything on the plate was cooked just right; salmon in medium rare, egg over easy, shimeji crispy, and most importantly, soba in just right firmness! I never order soba in US because they're somehow always overbooked, but this is Singapore, I gave it a try, and I'm so glad I did.",

    "text": "I passed this newly opened cafe a few times already but it was always super busy during weekends so when I had opportunity to go for brunch on a Friday, I decided to give this place a try. When I entered I was a bit wary as the place oozes a hipster atmosphere which to me often translates into average quality food against a premium price, you pay for the stylish environment, not for the food: WRONG, this is not what Atlas is about! The food is great and the price point is more than acceptable.Atmosphere: as mentioned this place has a relaxing hipster vibe, it's very instagram worthy, I am not a good photographer so I did not capture this in my pictures but google some pictures and you'll see what I mean. The service is friendly and punctual.Food: The menu had many interesting and healthy looking dishes but I decided to go for a brunch-style dish, I had the Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough \u00a0with scrambled eggs and Italian pork sausages. This could potentially go wrong in so many ways: chewy canned mushrooms, overcooked scrambled eggs and dry sausages but it was fantastic! The creamed shimeiji mushrooms are tasty, they provide a nice touch of unami to the dish and the sausages are juicy but the real stars are the sourdough and the scrambled eggs. The sourdough toast was perfect: good crust and one of the better tasting breads I had here in Singapore, the eggs were fluffy and light yet creamy, yum!Food part II: since I was hungry and greedy, we ordered next to our main dish a Maple Strawberry Pancake to share between two people. Once I had the Mushrooms & eggs on toast, I kinda regretted I'd ordered more as I was quite full and more than satisfied. More so, when the pancake arrived I feared it would be dry and bland as it looked thick. Wong again!! Whilst we both just really enjoyed our mains, we wolfed down the pancake like we hadn't eaten in ages! It is really delicious, the combo of fresh strawberries and the moist pancake is just great. The people next to us ordered the Caramelized banana pancakes with ice cream which looked absolutely delicious too (but I don't eat bananas so not for me).Price: I was pleasantly surprised to learn that our total check for two coffees and three mains (two savory dishes and one sweet to share) was similar to what I am used to pay for a typical weekend brunch for two in this neighborhood (around 50$). Prices are nett here, GST and service charge included. Additionally, they offer large jugs of ice water without charge!I'm coming again? 100% sure, their counter had cupcakes and cheese cake which looked very tempting and the I can see myself craving their dishes in the future! Since it is a new opening I hope they can keep this standard up.",

    "text": "Pros: It's a stone's throw away from Botanic Gardens MRT station, and there's a bus stop right in front of Atlas Coffeehouse, making it a convenient cafe to visit for those residing in the West. \u00a0The truffle fries aren't too pricey for local cafe standards ($8++), and the portion size is good for sharing among 2-3 persons. The flakes of cheese scattered on top of the fries is delicious! I also like how there are window seats and plenty of sunlight comes into the cafe. Their black, matte, industrial-looking stools are also surprisingly, quite comfy. And if you're a fan of white marble tables, there are plenty of those in this cafe. Their service also isn't too shabby.Finally, their peppermint tea tastes superb, so do give it a try! Cons: The truffle fries are a little on the greasy side, and I found this to be the case on both my first and second visit to Atlas Coffeehouse. On my second visit, the fries definitely tasted hard and crusty. I'm however, still a loyalist to PS. Cafe's truffle fries, as they are more consistent and fresh, as compared to Atlas Coffeehouse's. The cafe is quite popular and can get quite crowded, even on weekday afternoons.",

    "text": "I was here from around 2 - 4pm and it was so crowded!! There was thankfully enough space to sit down but the acoustics of the place meant that it got very noisy very fast! Apparently something is going to be done about that soon so hopefully it won't be as noisy in the future.It's a bit confusing to find, well for me it was, because I thought it was on Duke's Road itself, but actually it's in a building right next to it instead! Duke's Road itself has a lot of houses and no coffee shops.. heh...I tried their Ice Toffee Latte which even though it comes with a scoop of ice cream, you can ask for less syrup, which I'm not sure if it made a huge difference in taste with mine, but it was still very nice. Sort of like a more \"adult\" milkshake? It was quite rich and filling, so not ideal if all you want is a coffee. Their Atlas Signature Pancake was AMAZING. I've never seen a pancake before that looked like a literal cake made in a pan. It was so fluffy and had the right texture and moistness to it, but it was also about ONE INCH THICK. YEAH. ONE INCH THICK. It had a scoop of homemade ice cream as well as crunchy maple syrup cereal bits and bananas. I really think this is something to share with 2 people, unless you're really hungry and just want a sweet meal.. But even then, it's pretty massive as far as I'm concerned.Although it's a bit out of the way for me, I'm definitely going to remember this place if I'm in the area again!! Might even get to try some of the savory dishes for a change too.",

Make reservations on chope before you head there for brunch on the weekend, it's already busy by 9! The wooden tables and minimalist designed serving \u00a0plates are awesome! Make your order at the cashier when you've decided but otherwise, don't bother with self-service. The servers don't get too pleased when you try to help yourself. Several notable items I've tried:Nitro brew - not too acidic, smooth, good for patrons who enjoy coffee but have gastric problemsBerries waffle - love love love this. Great crisp and chew to waffle. Berries compote is a great balance of sour and sweet. Definitely a YES. Banana pancake - it's more like a sponge cake than pancake. The cornflakes are awesome but why are they soaked in syrup? The dish was too sweet for me. Hash - excuse me this is mashed potato not hash. Hash needs to cast iron pan to get its crust there's no crust in this hash. Flavors wise it was not bad. The sausage was delicious! Scrambled eggs - just get it! Great moist and delicious. Huge portion! Truffle fries - thin crispy fries with generous serving of Parmesan cheese. No truffle taste though. The cheese was nice I'll be back if I'm in the area but I probably won't travel the way here to have brunch",

It looked like they were running a full roster of staff for the weekend, and kudos for keeping the service and table turnover running efficiently smooth. Food was a refreshingly different from your standard brunch fare of egg bennies. If you're looking for a healthy alternative, try the Superbowls. The tasting flight of 3 cold brews was interesting; rather liked the Iced Carbon Black coffee, which I found out, was their house blend cold brew with tonic soda. Will be back to try their other brews.",

They had a large range of coffee so it was a pity we all had the same thing. Also a point of note, free water. I had the salmon soba noodles which came with glazed salmon and a fried egg. The egg was cooked well and the salmon was in my opinion, well-marinated. Did not get to try the waffles which looked really tantalising. Definitely worth a repeat visit.",
