Surprisingly, there were quite a few people, which is testament to how good they are.The concept here is that you get a card which records what you choose to drink from the wine machines. I quite like the concept, as you get to try a bunch of things, though why do they charge for a taste... :(Food here is good and competent. Nothing game-changing, just good food and good wine. The Amex platinum card has a 50% for two diners which makes this place quite value for money. Without the card, I'm not sure I would come again.",

We were told last order was at 10pm whereas when we were making reservation through Chope it gave us slots up to 10:15pm, so that didn't make sense. Any way, there were barely any people. We had to order from an iPad with no suggestions, help, recommendations. We ordered a large cold cuts platter which came with only two types of cheese and the waiter brought the bread basket afterwards and the oil, vinegar and butter later than that. We shared the truffle gnocchi between us which was served on a flat plate and had terrible texture and lacked flavor. It was covered in watery gravy which was hard to scoop out for the flat plate. No Parmesan or fresh ground pepper were offered. Looked like they just wanted to close up for the night. We had high expectations but quite disappointed.The place looked like it had potential but sadly failed.",

We have not had food this well prepared and presented in Singapore outside of a fine dining establishment.It's clear that this place turns into a big wine bar party at night because things are always a little askew during lunch. No matter, the chef is awesome and the staff are pleasant. I recommend the foie gras starter and tenderloin entree. There a few value priced wines as well along with higher end selections. Along with a la carte dining, lunch includes three tiers of set menus if you are inclined.Check out the wall of plaques parodying famous actors dressed as Napoleon complete with witty thoughts and reflections on alcohol.Will be back as often as I am able.",

    "text": "Unfortunately no photos as I was famished and inhaled the food. The Place:Nice cosy decor, small restaurant, nicely decorated. Seats a bit close together for a romantic dinner, but regardless of that the ipad menus ruin any remaining ounce of romance anyway. Did I mention I hate ipad menus?The back of the restaurant held the kitchen, which was viewable through the big glass window. This is great if you have a nice kitchen and have something interesting to show, not so great if your chefs can be seen playing with their phones or microwaving food. The Food:Despite my misgivings about the kitchen, the food was actually pretty tasty. I had poached salmon with carrot pur\u00e9e, my partner had seared tuna. My salmon was nicely cooked. I usually like salmon rare in the middle but this poached salmon managed to retain its moistness. The carrot pur\u00e9e and (what was a bit like) ratatouille weren't bad either - despite the carrot pur\u00e9e coming out of a plastic container. The tuna was ok. It was blue in the middle as its meant to be, however it really lacked any flavour. There was no char or grill flavour to the fish. A bit disappointing also that it was served with deep fried potato wedges rather than proper roasted potatoes. Wedges seem a bit out of place for a restaurant which is trying to be refined. The Good:- Tasty food- good service- reasonable prices- extensive menu - it's in the Entertainer appThe Less Good:- my plate was chipped and broken. Unforgivable. What if I had cut myself on it?- microwaved foodOverall I'd recommend This place and would come back...but I'd use the entertainer app.",

Unfortunately I couldn't take pictures of the food as I didn't want to look like a freak during the meeting.The coq au vin main dish I had was fantastic. The chicken was tender and tasty, the presentation is quite nice also. The really unique aspect of this restaurant/wine bar is their tech setup. They have an iPad mini at every table. Our table had like 3 or 4 of them. You place all your orders via the iPad. They have a pretty intuitive program to make ordering a breeze.They also give you a wine card so that you can go up and get yourself a glass of wine and have it keep tabs on this RFID card so you can settle later. I've seen a similar concept at a wine venue in SF before.As a tech geek, love how they are using technology to be different. I'm hoping one day I can come eat here and never see or talk to another human being in the process. (I'm kidding).",

When I tasted it and found out it was truffle oil.. I wonder why it wasn't IN my dish! Lol... Don't waste the truffle oil for plating purposes only la! I quicky scoop it up and put inside my dish sia... yummm!Good and prompt service. I shall be back one day for dinner... Maybe this time with a date perhaps? ;)",

    "text": "Solid spot for a weeknight dinner!Thanks to my visit here, I learned a few things about Singapore and life in general:1) I can't read Malay for shit. \"Telok Ayer\" is pronounced something along the lines of \"teh-low ah-yay\". Special thanks to the cabbie who dropped this knowledge on me and my colleague as we took a cab from the office to Napoleon! 2) An automatic wine dispenser is a must in my next house. (Miguel, are you taking note of this?)I came here for a double date with one of my super cool colleagues, and it was a good time. I ordered their carbonara, which was amazing (and in hindsight, I'm now realizing why I don't fit into my jeans anymore.) Although I can't remember what everyone else ordered, I do remember them being satisfied with it.Going back to the second thing I learned, Napoleon has this really fancy wine dispenser machine that theoretically allows you to sample all 32 of their wines. I say \"theoretically\" because each sample does cost you a few dollars, and you don't need to have a bill for over $100 just for tastings, do you? How do they know what you've tried? Well, you get this nifty card that you swipe and then you get the option of pressing 3 different buttons that range from a tasting to a full glass of wine. Then, through some voodoo magic, it somehow gets added to your bill at the end of the night!Definitely a convenient spot in CBD for a casual sit down dinner, with a good menu and hipster lighting (if you're into that stuff.) Worth giving a shot if you're in the area and looking for European fare.",

Out of our large party of guests, 3 people were given back the wrong credit cards to bring home. That's 10% of our party size. There could have been a lot more checks put in, such as signature checks or referring to the card in your hand and greeting your customers by name - these measures would have prevented such a disastrous mistake from occurring.",

    "text": "This month's Friday's after Five was held at Napoleon. I thought hey affordable wines + partial self-service so we don't have to wait around for tipple + affordable food = winning combination.Surprise surprise, we ended up drinking more cocktails than wine. The mixologist was eager to make drinks that each person was happy with and he used fresh fruit where possible. I'd only ask that the tea be brewed fresh instead of a concentrate. I did manage to try a glass of wine off the enomatic machine and unfortunately, it tasted more sour than the \"fruity\" notes that were promised. The $8 serving was also quite small, so I felt like I got better value at the bar. Food wise, we tried the calamari cabonara, shrimp and avocado salad and the sous vide steak. The salad was quite refreshing and I loved the grill-kissed shrimp. If only the avocado slices were more generous and there could have been a party on my plate. The Calamari cabonara was essentially a plate of strips of calamari in cream sauce and while that sounds quite heavy, it was rather delicious. The squid is 'rubbery' in a good way and you feel like you're eating a punchy ang moh mee pok. Finally the steak and mash was, how should I put it, gone in 8 minutes with all the sauce mopped up.Everyone had a great time I think and the food and drinks didn't burn a hole in our pockets. The owners were a little antsy about our party as half the people were an hour late and we had booked the entire bar. I guess that's fair considering it's a small, new business but really guys when I bring a party I bring it.",
