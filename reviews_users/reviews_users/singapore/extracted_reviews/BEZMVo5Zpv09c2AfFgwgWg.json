As with the rest of Chijmes, I find that Prive attracts the younger, working adult crowd.",

We hung out at Noir for a bit then found this spot - thanks to the band that was playing and singing inside. The music caught my attention.Tons of people for a Tuesday night. No dance floor. Just a really dark or intimate bar/lounge w/ a stage and an area for the DJ. I really wanted to dance and I was. Got Jerry in the mood so we hung out until we had to go back because we work the following morning. Friendly servers. Clientele was mainly folks in the mid 40's which did not bother me. I like men in business suits! People looked as though they came straight from work and stayed out until it was time to leave. Most bars and lounges in Singapore close at 4AM. Crazy, right? Tends to be busy on Tues-Weds. Strong White Russian.Our 2nd time hanging out at night together. I heart that guy. My best.",

So hipster and lovely. Everything else? Eh meh. The food here is overpriced and taste terrible. Maybe I'm just from the US so I'm used to all American food being great.. but really only the fries were good. I ordered the Croque Monsieur(17sg) which is pretty much fancy grilled cheese with ham inside and my friend had the fish and chips (21sg). Yeah nothing impressive. Just buy a thick slice of bread and melt some cheese on top of it yourself :/ Would not recommend this place to anyone.",

I would say of the 'food experience', there is more emphasis put on the 'experience' rather than 'food'. \u00a0Chijmes is gorgeous and Prive has a very nice outdoor seating available right in the middle court. People most likely would be happy with the beautiful ambiance of the entire area. In such setting, people, including myself, become quite generous about rating the place. (yes, 3 star is very generous, if we were to talk strictly about the food experience with more emphasis on the food. I've had the steak salad, carbonara and seafood pizzaSteak salad was just.. bearable. Steak was nothing impressive, and salad greens tossed together. Nothing much to be said, other than the fact that I wouldn't recommend. Carbonara with poached egg was the best.. or the better of the three dishes. It was pretty good actually, although I wouldn't say it was an authentic carbonara. A good cream-based pasta. Seafood pizza was a bit sad, given that there was only a few small shrimp meat found on the pizza to be called a seafood pizza. Yes, the food was mediocre. But didn't really have much high expectation to begin with. I loved the ambiance of the place though. Chijmes is just gorgeous.",

Again I forgot that I'm now in Singapore and outdoor seating can be a nightmare - which was the case for our dinner. Service here is terrible and they are not even apologetic that the whole row of fans is \"broken\". Also my friend and I were debating whether our waiter took our order with his phone because he was just looking down and typing away as we spoke. I believe he was but it's just odd and didn't look professional especially at a place this nice (an ipad should have been a better option).We had 2 pasta, one with spicy lobster and the other with vodka sauce. The spicy lobster was actually quite good, but the one with vodka sauce was underwhelming and the smoked salmon too salty. Price was, like what the first review said, average for the location (aka expensive).",

I joined friends a bit late and they had already eaten, as I was looking over the menu I asked about their meals and the kids meals, and independently, everyone was talking they didn't hear each other's answers, it was \"Eh it was okay.\" And when my food and others came out, that would sum it up. The food was okay, not bad, I wouldn't send it back, I didn't feel cheated, but I certainly wasn't pleased or impressed. We were there during a very busy easter Sunday brunch, and due to a great kids function in Chijmes the place was very busy. Perhaps the service was related to this amount of business, but the food took a very long time to come out of the kitchen. I didn't time it, but everyone was relaxed and talking and yet still looking up twice and saying \"Where's the food?\"The atmosphere is nice, taking up a corner in the central courtyard of Chijmes with mostly outdoor seating. The majority of the seating has no cover, so beware, the usual Singapore rain shower could reak havoc on your dining experience.",
