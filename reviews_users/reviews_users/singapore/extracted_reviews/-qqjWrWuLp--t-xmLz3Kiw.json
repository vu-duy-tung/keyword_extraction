    "text": "This place is a local institution. It used to be run by Fatty when it was on Rochor Road, and the business has since been handed down to his children. Most of the dishes are pretty up to standard. In particular I'd recommend the pork ribs, crispy stir-fried noodles and the homemade beancurd. It's probably a bit better for lunch than dinner as it fills up with visiting air crew in the evenings. Service is gruff but efficient. Good value for money, lunch was like $15 per person for a party of 6.",

    "text": "A friend who grew up in Singapore recommended this place for authentic Singaporean food. We came in for an early dinner and got:- spicy chili crab: delicious. Sweet and savory tomato-based sauce smothering meaty pieces of crab. This was exactly what I wanted.- water spinach with garlic: good, subtle flavor. There were pieces of garlic in the sauce, but it wasn't overwhelming. This was recommended by the proprietor and I'm glad we took it.- fried rice with salted fish. This tied the meal together. Rice had good wok-fired flavor and the pieces of salted fish gave a nice texture and salty bite. They're like little pieces of fish bacon.Add a large bottle of Tiger, and you've got a fantastic meal. We paid around 80 SGD, which is incredibly reasonable for the amount and quality. Would love to come back with a bigger group to try more dishes next time!",

First impression this is quite a big restaurant but very busy even off time. \u00a0It is not clean nor dirty, just average of Chinese restaurant. The decoration is also similar to other Chinese's style street restaurant. The owner speak little English but still able to understand and give good food recommendation. Very lovely old lady. The food..looks plane but the taste...magnificent!! I don't know how to describe, its the best Chinese food I had in years. The portion is also quite generous. We ordered every dish medium size but they looks like large size to us. We ate until we are stuff, can't believe we were able to finish all the food. Even more surprising, it taste so good since the first bite till the last. And then came the bill....lest than S$80 for 4big dishes and 2 big bottle or beer thats S$20 for person! Awesome!!",

    "text": "good singaporean-chinese mainstay near bugis. guys, this place is a local institution - it's the sort of old-school restaurant your grandparents and their grandparents went to (depending on how old you/they are) for their birthdays and weddings and chinese new year celebrations.in short, eating here is like paying respect to nostalgia and all your forefathers stood for - and it doesn't hurt that the cooking is fantastic, classics executed perfectly, and service efficient (as it always was in the old days).it's the kind of food most of us chinese in singapore grew up eating, a little more polished and extravagrant than mum's daily cooking, but familiar enough to feel as comforting.that also means that while there is a lot I could tell you about how soft and yielding the tofu was, how sweet-savory the sauce on the pork ribs, and how those individual grains of fried rice were expertly seasoned and delicious, I could just as well say nothing much - silence here as implicit approval and agreement with the esteemed expertness of this place.if you're curious, we had tender sweet and sour fish cooked with a medley of fruit, a simple plate of fried rice, pork ribs, a dish of sauteed mixed vegetables, their house specialty of beancurd with mushrooms, and some salt-and-pepper squid.but be more curious, and come visit. it's not posh, it's not refined - but it's fantastic old-school cooking that reminds me of big family meals as a young kid amongst a big lot of other grandchildren, and it takes me well back, in the best of ways.",

There is not a time when I visit Singapore ( over the last 28 yrs) that I do not eat at Fattys as do many others. My all time favorite dish is the baby Gai lan and Prawns with Salted Egg Yolk...delicious... accompanied by lime juice, very refreshing. This place is casual and fun with reliable food. Do try it.",

    "text": "Fatty's is across the pedestrian street from Sim Lim Square - a notorious place for rip-offs. It seems ol' Fatty himself has been taking lessons from the cowboys there.Ordered up two main courses to share - firstly, the medium assorted vegetables ($8) was very nice and full of a bunch of different vegetables (to be expected I suppose). Secondly, got the fried kway teow with seafood and gravy ($8) which was pretty spectacular. Picked up a Tiger ($6.40/ lg bottle) and were in and out of there in 30 minutes.Got the bill, and there is a surcharge for the towels (60c). We didn't use the towels, so I have no idea why they added it to the bill. It is a shame, because this sort of penny pinching just sucks, and where I would have thought about returning to this place - I think I will try something else. If the manager ever reads this, please stop being a cheap bastard and charging for standard dining items.",
