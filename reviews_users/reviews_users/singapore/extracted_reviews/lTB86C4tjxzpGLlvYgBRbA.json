    "text": "Searching for good Vietnamese food in Singapore has always been somewhat of an ordeal. For whatever reason, though popular, it's just not the same here. Until now. Either I've lowered my expectations, or this is possibly the closest I've experienced to Vietnamese street food on this little island. Sure it's not 100% the same, but the banh xeo and banh choen comes really close. Of course the first big difference you notice will be the price difference from street food in Hanoi. About 40x difference by my estimate. But hey, who's counting? For once we have close to decent Vietnamese in Singapore. That's all that matters.",

We decided to dine here as the restaurant allowed us to use the Entertainer mobile application 1 for 1 main course on quite a number of choices from hotpot to noodle soup dishes to rice dishes to stir fried noodle dishes.Banh cuon nhan thit ($3.50++/ 2 rolls)Minced pork & mushrooms steamed rice crepe rollsThe dish was served with a sweet tangy sauce. The skin of the rice roll was quite thin and smooth. The dish was quite yummy.Com suon nuong ($12.90++)Grilled pork chop rice with salted egg puddingThe pork chop was quite tender and flavourful, although it had a rather dry look. The egg pudding was actually minced meat with salted egg in it.Pho xao ga ($12.90++)Stir fried pho noodles with chickenThe noodles was quite smooth although it looked quite thick. The sauce was rich and flavourful. Tra xa ($4.50++)Vietnamese Hot Lemongrass TeaQuite a refreshing drink to have during such a hot weather.Overall the food was not bad. Service was not bad too. Cutlery were cleared smoothly. Total bill was $29.90.",

The bit of dill and mint added a lot of flavor, lifting the dish to another level. I enjoyed the dish :)Starter was the mango salad with caramelized dried shrimp. Was average as far as a mango salad goes.",

    "text": "Wrap & Roll is a restaurant chain from Ho Chi Minh started in 2006. The lens thru which I present this review is filtered and somewhat biased as I love Vietnamese food. Rice paper rolls, fresh herbs and vegetables and fish sauce. Yum!Love the rice vermicelli bowls here. Grilled pork and deep fried spring rolls is the noodle bowl I gravitate to. The combination of mint leaves, fresh cucumbers and bean sprouts and the crunch of the spring roll, mixed with a morsel of chargrilled pork is simply divine. The sweet and salty fish sauce only serve to further enhance the dish!Other dishes I've had before are their roll-it-yourself dishes which showcase the diversity of cuisine from the different regions in Vietnam. Order the c\u00e0 ph\u00ea sa \u0111\u00e1 (Vietnamese ice coffee with milk). This is the traditional drip coffee that totally slows down time for you as you wait for the mixture to come together. Can't rush it unless you want coffee grinds in your beverage. Intense coffee flavors, sweetened with condensed milk, iced!! Recommended to get your Vietnamese cuisine fix.",

Although its \"buyer beware\" in any purchase, my experience of Vietnamese pho has been that its sumptuous, colorful and delicious. \u00a0This experience was a \u00a0sad, grey, stingy and expensive one.",
