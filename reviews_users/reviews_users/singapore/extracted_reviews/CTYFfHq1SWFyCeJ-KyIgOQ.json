    "text": "We affectionately call this place FoMo (short for Faux Mozza). Like the famous Mozza at Marina Bay Sands, this place features a mozeralla bar with tons of cheese selections. But unilke Mozza, the prices are very very reasonable, and the portions are huge and meant to be shared.We really like the burrata and other cheese features. Sometimes their condiments aren't very classic pairings, but the quality of the cheese and the amount more than make up for it. The mains are also good, the hanger steak is awesome.I'm docking one point for the pastas. They taste like they're out of the box, and not the classic Italian taste -- overflavored, oversalted, and not fresh pasta. But they give you a huge amount.",

    "text": "I set the bar pretty high for Italian restaurants so you can take this with a grain of salt, but I thought this place was pretty unremarkable. I'll start with what I liked about it. The manager (owner?) was was friendly and engaging, greeting us at the table and taking our orders. One of the dishes we ordered was gnocchi in a truffle sauce. The sauce was very good: \u00a0flavorful but not heavy. And the serving sizes were satisfying. Now the bad. 1) Service was friendly (I always appreciate that), but terrible. There was only one waiter for the entire restaurant, so it took a long time to get served, we had to ask for things multiple times because he kept forgetting, and some things never came at all. 2) I don't often say this, but the gnocchi was too firm. Almost rubbery. 3) I ordered the squash risotto, and found it completely flavorless and a bit chalky. 4) Worst of all, we ordered two mozzarella dishes and they tasted like Philadelphia cream cheese. I realize we're a long way from Naples, but that is not the kind of quality I expected from a self-proclaimed \"Mozzarella bar\". 5) Oh, and it was crazy loud. I'm not sure why they decided that metal sheeting was a good way to decorate the ceilings, but don't come here expecting a quiet, romantic dining experience.",

I mean how can you go wrong with the truffle and prosciutto!We all had pasta. All were great even though not as outstanding as the mozzarella.Linguine Vongole & Porcini - probably the best out of the 3, Olive oil based, vongole were great.Spaghetti Sardi, Bottarga AOP - good but not enough bottarga (grey mullet dried eggs, resembles the taiwanese oh hi ji' or the dried mullet roe. Olive oil based, could use more bottarga to my taste but it is quite strong...Linguine Crab & Mascarpone - a little too creamy for my taste but goodFor desert we had the Tiramisu - excellent and BIGWine-wise, I did not like the Chianti (but I never do) I still ended up with \u00a0it through because I liked the Primitivo even less (strong but drops dead in your mouth) and the last one that's available by the glass was out of stock.I will definitely go again and I might just have mozzarella only!",

Loved the generous portions of crab meat in the sauce as well. Recommended.2) grilled whole Seabass: really lovely huge portion of the fish that was extremely fresh. Cooked to perfection.

    "text": "I still sweat at the memory of my lunch in the lovely courtyard of this restaurant. It's no fault of the location, because who sits outdoors in the midday sun on one of the hottest days of the year unless you're trying to get a tan or an expat?! While that choice did not make things better, the real reason the meal was extremely average was the overall taste of all the dishes. Of all the items that we ordered, there were two hits and two complete misses. To clarify, I came here for the set lunches which are 25++ for starter, main and tea or coffee. The setting is reminiscent of a cafe by a cobblestone paved street in France and it was one of those days where I needed the peace the memory invoked. The price is fairly reasonable for the quantity. The burratina in the salad showed promise (it does say 'mozzarella bar') but the truffle oil with chickpeas soup was a complete disappointment. It's partly my fault for not asking what kind of chickpea soup but that combination was atrocious and oddly bland coupled with my dislike for truffle. The leaves were a bit old but nothing criminal. Then came my sliced beef main - rather well done, but with disappointing roast potatoes and a tasteless salad as sides. The second main was the fresh pasta, bolognaise, a very salty and overpowering dish that felt too heavy after the first few bites. The coffee and tea at the end was just average, not artisanal or anything.If you're expecting finer cuisine like I was, given the venue and prices, I think you might be left disappointed. However, I've heard the dinners are far better so perhaps I'd change my review some day.",

They are all wonderful, but I love the classic and well executed flavors of the bufala with sweet cherry tomatoes and basil and the savory stracciatella with roast zucchini. \u00a0There is a great variety of mozzarellas available as well as beautiful pairings with a few kinds of sweet roasted vegetables or savory oils or meats. \u00a0Their main courses are also well executed and the lamb shank is consistently tender while the pastas are cooked al dente with generous helpings of sauce (I've had lasagne and the weekend brunch pasta with cream sauce - YUM!) \u00a0Finally their desserts don't disappoint and I love that Sunday brunch comes with 3 different kinds (mmm the smooth panna cotta may be my favorite!) Indulge away!If you're looking for a delicious Italian meal with a heavy skew towards cheese, you definitely have to eat at Latteria! \u00a0They also have one of the best Sunday brunches around with generous family style helpings of cheese, pasta, steak and dessert!",

    "text": "We had a really enjoyable Friday night dinner here. Duxton is a nice chill out area that is not crazy busy. Plus after a whole day of rain, the weather was at a nice cool 24 degrees, perfect for outdoor dining!Menu is not big. Love places where they just focus on what they do well. As the name suggest, this is a mozzarella bar, so this cheese is featured on a whole page of the menu.We started with two types: one wrapped around truffle, arugula and prosciutto. Beautiful. How do you go wrong with a combination like that. The mozzarella goes well with the saltiness of the ham and the bitterness of the leaves..and you are spoilt further with black truffles. Genius.The second one we had was a creamier mozzarella served on top of a bed of grilled zucchini. Delish too as this mozzarella has a much richer taste and texture. A great contrast to the first. We can't decide which one we like better.Main course we had the special of the day: a wagyu beef steak. Done perfectly medium rare, charred on the outside and lightly pink inside. Meat was succulent and moist with a great bite.The second main course is the spaghetti with mussels in a white wine sauce. On first mouth, I thought it was a tad salty. But the sweetness of the seafood broth with lots of garlic and white wine came through as you eat. Their spaghetti is very thin, even thinner than the usual linguine. Almost like an angel hair. Done al dente. Very nice.We ended the meal with dessert. Lemon panda cotta with strawberries in balsamic reduction. The panda cotta is not sweet like some places and really smooth. Yum too.Service was great as we were served by Kirby who recommended everything. After the two appetizers, we basically told him to just get us what he likes most from the menu for the rest of our meal and we ended up leaving very happy.",

Lovely setting with the shophouses behind.I was starving by the time we got there (long walk from office :p) and so was very thankful for the bread + olive oil/balsamic vinegar (although somehow I couldn't get at much of the balsamic vinegar :( think it had sunk beneath the oil!). Piping hot from the oven and deliciously crisp on the outside, warm on the inside, and fluffy!!! I love their bread.Both of us had the restaurant week menu. Pan-fried buffalo milk mozzarella wrapped in parma ham. 3 mozzarella balls! Very nice presentation. Parma ham wrapped around each ball with some herbs sprinkled on top, with some rocket and cherry tomato wedge in each little compartment of the 3-part dish. I found the ham a bit slightly (but never really like ham anyway), balsamic reduction that came with was sweet and hence a good foil! I chose the seafood cacciucco while bf had the lambshank. Lamb was tender, falling off the bone with a prod of the fork. Delicious sauce! He said he could taste the cream/butter in the mashed potatoes. I actually didn't find the cacciucco remarkable, but again I don't really have anything much to compare it to. Nice tomato-y broth, light, fair amount of seafood (clams, fish, prawns, squid, all well cooked, not too tough or anything). Two thin slices of toast (rosemary/sea salt sprinkled, I think?) and of course, I mopped up the soup with the rest of the delicious bread!Dessert - red wine pear with mascarpone mousse and chocolate shavings. Delicious! A tad on the sweet side, but nicely poached pear and mousse went together well.",

    "text": "I found this place while trying to figure out where Entrecote was. Four of us came for the $24-ish set lunch--fantastic value as you get 3 courses for your money. Unfortunately (but understandably) there's only one mozzarella dish in all the options, but the entire menu is open to you if you feel like burata at lunch time (or any time!). Between us we got to try most of the mains--the fish was good. And the tiramisu, ZOMG Definitely worth coming back at dinner time!",

    "text": "Had a great dinner at Latteria tonight. Their burrata and other mozzerellas are definitely worth the trip. We had the classic burrata and the stracciatella with roasted zucchini, and I could've been happy with just those two cheeses and some bread. But on top of that, we also had eggplant parmigiana, which I thought was actually a little too heavy on the cheese and too light on the eggplant. The flavor was still good, though. Finally, for the entree we shared the roast lamb shanks, which were tasty and tender, if a little gamey - but I think lamb shank is pretty much always gamey, right?Aside from the food, the service was knowledgable, fast, and friendly. The lighting and ambiance inside are nice, but something about the acoustics make it really noisy for the size and number of people in that space. That's fine though if you're going in a large group, family style, which is what I'd recommend anyway.",

Menu is not overwhelming but that's good because you know they are focused on what they are passionate about.Overall dinning experience was pleasant. I loved the simple ambiance and friendly service. Meal was heavy (thanks to the mozzarellas) and felt well served. Wouldn't mind coming back again but definitely not on a weekly basis......",

    "text": "I'm not entirely sure how authentically Italian the food here is. I mean mac & cheese inside a pumpkin? Come on guys. I guess I'd be impressed with the innovation if I liked pumpkin. Unfortunately I hate it. But I do love mac & cheese and with some careful fork work I was able to avoid the vile orange stuff it was enclosed in.Everything else we ordered was delicious. The crab linguine wasn't quite as awesome as my favourite at Kith Cafe but was still pretty great. Probably a little too much sauce smothering, it rendered the dish less than delicate.I also really liked the lamb and the risotto. Add this to the wonderful al fresco vibe on Duxton Hill and this is definitely a restaurant you should try. A word of warning: the indoor dining room can get very very loud.",

    "text": "I love this section of Duxton Hill because it reminds me of Europe, what with the cobble-stoned road and lush trees lining each side of it. The one thing that makes it unmistakably Singaporean are the beautifully restored shophouses. It's definitely a great retreat from the increasingly busy Tanjong Pagar stretch, and there is a good selection of restaurants here.Latteria is a fairly new addition and took over Jackson's Plan, which means they have that great outdoor garden space, and they've done a good job in making it cosy, well-lit and generally very pretty at night. The interiors are inspired, too, and they have unique light fixtures and beautiful furniture.They serve Italian cuisine with a focus on mozarella - it appears in lots of the entrees. There's a good variety of options to choose from, and the food is not bad at all. Worth a shot, and definitely try to get a table in their beautiful al fresco dining area!",

Linsel was our waiter and he was kind and gracious. We ordered the burratini with pumpkin appetizer, lamb shank, special tagliatelle with pork cheek, and tiramisu. All were delicious. We sat outside and the setting was lovely. Probably our favorite meal during our two week stay in Singapore.",
