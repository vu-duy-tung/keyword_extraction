    "text": "It's cheap. It's good. And it's near to the office. I kinda think I'm a fan, yet I don't think the quality here really merits four stars. The price for lunch though, I think that's worth a fourth star all by itself. The soup bases are pretty good, the coconut chrysanthemum is an interesting combination, the herbal chicken is better than the normal chicken, and the tomyum's not bad either. But (for lunch specifically) you're able to get sets that include meat, veg, a carb, and your own hotpot of soup for UNDER TEN DOLLARS!? That's an absolute steal! The office fav is the drunken chicken set, though the pork set's good value too.So the next time you're in Tiong Bahru and am sick of the fare at the market, consider Le Le Hot Pot. It's affordable, and on a cool rainy day, it really hits the spot.",

Ordering the Dory fish is a safe choice, it's the only really edible stuff. The rest comes frozen, the pork slices has bits of bone on all of the slices, not much meat. Sorely disappointed.",

    "text": "This place has a buffet dinner for about $30 per person, with drinks not included. There is a tiny sauce station for you to mix your own sauces, but the choices are quite limited.We decided to go with tom yum (quite spicy) and the coconut chrysanthemum soup bases. The coconut chrysanthemum wasn't quite what I expected. It was the standard chicken broth with flower petals and desiccated coconut. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing either. I had imagined fresh coconut flesh but well, this place is the budget sort.You make orders from the menu and they are very stingy with their portions so you need to articulate exact quantities because they are trying to prevent food wastage. The meats here are nothing to shout about, but the prices are low. The hotpots here are on portable gas stoves, so sometimes the gas runs out and the staff will come round to replace the cannister.Would I come back? I don't know. I was pretty thirsty after my meal.",

    "text": "Wow this was so worth it. For lunch, I paid $8 for a hotpot filled with bubbling soup (of my own) and a large bowl of rice AND a plate fillted with meat, veggies, mushrooms and tofu.So you choose a meat - pork, chicken, beef, I think there's seafood too; A staple - noodle variations or rice; A soup - chicken, funny coconut chrysanthemum (?!?!?!), sichuan mala (numbingly hot) and tomyam. There's like 5-8 options for each category.Ingredients are so-so (few slices of pork for me with lots of chinese cabbage, luncheon meat, tofu and enoki mushrooms), soup was A-ok (I had the tomyam, it was slightly sweet and not spicy enough) and you can't really go wrong with rice. The restaurant was empty when we were there so service was not an issue since we were the only customers. There was a decent counter for making your own sauces for dipping. Ambience, not much, but there's air-con and you don't really come out smelling like a hot pot restaurant. Might not be the case when there's more people around though.Good deal but I'm not sure if I would come back unless I'm desperate for hot pot for cheap. Still, worth trying if you're in the area.",

It's just a short walk from the office so my coworkers and I have ended up here on more than one occasion. Le Le Pot has a variety of different broths and you can add a plethora of different items into the pot with the broth. I really like the Tom Yum broth with chicken and veggies. It's the perfect rainy day lunch for me!",

    "text": "Le Le Pot is definitely one of the better hot pot buffets around, by a far cry. Fresh and prosciutto-thin beef and meat slices along with a wide variety of greens, sotong/fish/meat/all sorts of balls, and myriad of sauces to permutate dipping your food in add up to a strong beckoning everything I crave for hot pot.Service is fairly prompt, they may forget one or two orders with everyone trying to eat their money's worth and ordering more than their table can hold. Be nice and remind them and they're usually apologetic and will bring them along shortly. It does feel like they try to nickel and dime you sometimes e.g. drinks are not included and a few other dishes that are ordinarily included in such buffets are charged separately, limiting the variety available to someone who just wants to stick to the per pax buffet price. So if you're not careful, the final bill may come up to alot more than you were willing to pay for when you first entered the shop. I came on a public holiday once and was only told that the buffet price is $3 higher than usual, only after we were seated and had placed our orders. Foot in the door, we had no choice but to agree, that, and the beef on the next table looked really good for two starving people.They've now expanded to another unit to cater for the increased demand so it should be much easier to secure a seat now (there used to be a 45 min wait for dinner if you're walking in).",

You get a round of dessert.This area is notorious for parking fines so do make sure you park legally and tear your coupons.",
