We ordered additional drinks that were totally forgotten, and finally came at the end of the meal after we reminded them. Our waiter was nice, but new. The rest of the staff was not pleasant, sometimes rude, and made you feel like you were bothering them by being there. \u00a0Not exactly the type of atmosphere you hope for when spending hundreds of dollars for our group of 9.",

    "text": "Okay, I guess it's a bit ironic that I'm mentioning a competitor website (kinda), but Hungrygowhere's list of top five (insert ethnicity) restaurants hasn't failed me yet! I thought the food was pretty yummy and fairly cheap.Be warned though, this place is somewhat similar to a Korean BBQ place in that you may end up coming out smelling of BBQ! Delicious, but perhaps not the best sort of perfume.. Anyway, here on a Sunday afternoon, fairly crowded, seemed to be quite populated with Filipinos. Service was fairly quick - although we did have to wait a little bit for our waters to get refilled.Grilled squid aka Inihaw na Pusit ($14.95) was delicious! Nice sauce and good char-grill taste. Not too chewy, nice bite to it. A bit too charred at some places - we were trying to scrape a bit off (avoid carcinogens.. plus completely burnt bits don't make for the nicest taste either).Bulanglang ($7.45) was pretty good too, hadn't had it before so it was definitely interesting. Mixed vegetables in a rather salty sauce (as long as you don't try to drink the sauce on its own you're fine - just be satisfied with it flavouring/clinging on to the veges!) I liked the eggplant, had a good roasted taste. Other veges include bittergourd (not a fan in general), pumpkin (ok, not that sweet), okra, long beans, some tomato/onion (yum!). Also, four pieces of grilled fish on top had pretty good flavour too!Garlic rice ($1.70) was nice, soft and flavourful; I bet a good amount of oil went in to making it moist/yummy. Haha. Oh well...Pinaputok na cream dory ($11.95) was also delicious! I thought 'cream dory' meant it was going to be creamy so I was a bit wary, but boy was I wrong. This dish came wrapped in a banana leaf (I love foods that are steamed/wrapped in leaves! They are usually scrumptious) and tasted pretty healthy (surprisingly, Filipino food isn't really something I associate with healthy living haha). Steamed veges (tomato/onion/leeks) with tender fish, mmm. Glad my dad picked it!",

The dishes that they did have were okay, but not great. The pancit palabok is made with the big thick noodles, but I prefer it with the thinner kind. The lechon kawali was tough, like it had either been sitting around for a while or just overcooked. I'm not sure why there are so few Filipino restaurants in Singapore despite the large Filipino population, but I'm hoping I can find a better one.",

I be eaten here a couple of times, try the BBQ - anything is good, also try the traditional dishes....adobo, caldereta etc. It's full of Pinays so expect a big noise level - I tried the Kari Kari, which was awful, there's a little place in Joo Chiatt does it much better, the rice was cold, the Sisig was ok, the drinks are a bit pricey, service is mediocre, prices reasonable I guess for Orchard Road area. I'd go back but wouldn't rush.",
