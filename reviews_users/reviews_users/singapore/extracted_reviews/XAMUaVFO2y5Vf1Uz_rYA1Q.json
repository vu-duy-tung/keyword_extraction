I love the atmosphere here, it feels fancy and service is great. However should you find yourself wanting to try what they have to offer you do need quote a bit of patience as service is rather slow from waiting in line to the serving of the food. Food is good however the menu is a little messy whereby I had to ask the waiters questions about the things I'm about to order. Taste wise is above average but price wise it's more on the pricey side.",

However, it is severely lacking in space and you'll find yourself sandwiched between different groups of diners most of the time. Expect bumps to happen whenever people move around, which may not be the most comfortable of dining experiences to be had, considering the setting and all. Overall, I'd have to say that the service is brisk and polite, but the lack of space is a severe flaw in the overall planning. They have to expand or people will just get sick of paying them a visit!",

After I tasted their tea during afternoon high-tea at The landing point, I wanted to bring some of their tea back to US. The store is beautifully decorated with a whole wall of large tea cans. There are designed tea cans from small to big. The infused tea were similar to Tea-forte, the tea spot and Teavana. The salesman has this snobby facial expression on his face all the time.Why is he so arrogant about selling tea leaves? \u00a0After I purchased a few of their infused tea and macarons, the female cashier looks very annoyed when I tried to take a picture of the store\" No pictures\". She waved her hand right in front of my camera lens. And the guy who just sold us the tea pretended it wasn't his business. Cuz his job was done, right after we paid him. \u00a0Wow, Really? I assumed this is not a fashion store, it's just a tea store. What's so secretive about the store that I can't take picture with it? If there is a no-photograph policy, you should just mention it in a polite way instead of being a bitch. This TWG is trying to be an upscale store,but unfortunately the people who work for them are discourteous.",

    "text": "I ended off my visiting friends' short stay in Singapore with a posh afternoon hi-tea experience. So some basic information about the place. TWG is a tea boutique franchise based in Singapore, set up by a Singaporean and French pair of friends who met in Morocco. They aim to transform the tea experience - which I understood to mean poshing it up many levels higher to trump the usual coffee&tea places. I like that idea as afternoon hi-teas are supposed to be posh, posh.Ambience: I have visited the TWG tea parlour branch at Ion Orchard. I prefer the branch at MBS as it is more spacious and enjoys more natural light. This is a fancy tea place - but somehow some patrons dine in shorts and tee-shirts. So please dress up nicely. Expect proper napkins, cutlery and fancy tea sets!Service: Impeccable - tonnes of servers milling about making sure that you are well-taken care of!Tea: Such a huge selection of tea flavours to choose from. Apparently, their white teas are quite popular. But they cost approx $26/pot. The more ordinary teas such as Holiday in Paris (I loved it) and Earl Grey are approx $13/pot. Quite pricey for tea ... and when I was at the Ion Orchard branch, they did not refill my tea pot with hot water though my girlfriend said they did so at the Taka branch for her. I ordered a tea milk shake when I was at MBS (the Asian tea flavour) - which was so satisfying - wasn't too thick nor too sweet - and you could sense good tea in there with all that milk and sugar!Food: or rather, confectionary. I'm a huge huge macaroon fan. The macaroon flavours here are all tea-inspired! I tried quite a few flavours that day ... I can't tell you my favourite as I need to try more of them to decide. Don't expect Laduree/Piere Herme sort of premium macaroons ... but these macaroons are still decent macaroons, good enough for a posh afternoon hi-tea experience. and we had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e tart as well - it was rather underwhelming :( And I heard the savoury options aren't too impressive either.If you want to posh it out slightly in MBS (as a tourist or local), I would definitely recommend coming here. But don't expect much of the food.",

As with all its outlets, the table settings and decor exude a sense of luxury and class. My friends and I swung by from their ION outlet which closes rather early at 9:30 daily. To say they have an extensive collection is putting it mildly. Their menu is choke full of choices and amusing names, especially the tea blends. Be sure to ask for the tea book if you want more details about a specific tea. I ordered a pot of Silver Moon tea, a green tea blend which was meant to be shared by two. I was told I could pour about 3 cups from the pot. It turns out that the fancy tea pot with an insulator only poured out two cups worth of tea leaving us disappointed but we did fill out cups up pretty well so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. What you're really paying for is the location and the ambience. I'd definitely bring a date here to round off the evening with a good cup of tea.",

I've always walked by this location every time I've been to Singapore and I was always curious to what it was like. I landed in Singapore in the late afternoon and wanted a quick snack time with some caffeine involved.I ordered the Fortune Tea Set during their high tea hours. I thought the food was very delicious. Just what you would want for an afternoon pick up. My tea tower included one of the finger sandwiches, scones or muffins, and three macarons. I decided on the truffle croque, the golden raisen scones, a earl grey tea macaron, a rose macaron, and a tiramisu macaron. For the tea, I decide on the hot original Black Tea 1837. I would be back again for afternoon high tea. Not sure if I want to eat here for a full meal because there are a ton of other heartier and more \"value\" options around the Marina Bay Shoppes. I say give this place a try if your looking for high tea and live your glamorous life! You're in Singapore in the first place!",

    "text": "Great afternoon tea spot after shopping/window shopping all day! Their tea menu is INSANE - there's a guide book too for those who want a more detailed description of the teas. You really can't go wrong with any of the selections. The basic tea set is S$19, which comes with a pot of tea and a pastry or 2 scones/muffins. This would also be a good lunch spot for a date or something. Even though it's in the middle of the mall, the space is quite nice with some privacy behind the pots of orchids. Besides from the pastries in their trolley, you can also get special desserts. We tried the tarte tatin, wouldn't really recommend it. The tarte that the stewed apple came in was quite hard, so it was hard to eat it all together. The black berry fruit tart was quite nice though! Oh, and scones come with clotted cream and jam. TIP: there's not a second steeping (they brew the tea in the back), but you can ask for more hot water.",

    "text": "Pretty much everything went wrong, but sometimes you have to find humor in disaster. My girlfriends and I stopped by for a (very expensive) snack because one of them desperately needed to charge her iPhone. This is what defines millennial friendship- spending money for access to a power outlet.We were seated and left to peruse the menu. 20 minutes pass without any server attention. Well, I guess there's no rush since her phone was charging behind the bar and our feet were in dire need of rest. A server finally approaches, but to move us to a table on the other side because our current section needed \"maintenance.\" Sketchy, but ok. After 10 minutes at our new table, our order still hadn't been taken. At this point, we thought of it as a game and actively tried not to get their attention...until I noticed ants crawling all over my silverware. We informed a server and he moved us to...the table immediately next to it. Because ants keep to themselves and wouldn't bother us if we're 1 ft away. Anyway, at our third table in 35 minutes, we finally placed our order- earl grey tea, mushroom soup, 1 earl grey macaron, 1 grand wedding macaron, and 2 black tea blackcurrant macarons. We tore into the macarons, and my BFF noted that the black one tastes nothing like blackcurrant. I commented that it actually tasted like caramel, then realized that we may have been given the Napoleon tea with caramel by mistake. I asked our server what flavor this black colored macaron was, and he confirmed my suspicion. I told him we ordered a different one, and his response, \"oh I heard you say black so I thought you wanted the black colored macaron.\" Wtf? I didn't order them by color- I ordered them exactly as listed on the menu. \"I guess it's okay, we already ate most of it...\" I trailed off, expecting he'd come thru with an apology for his dumbassedness and offer to bring the correct ones. I got nothing but an awkward staring contest. Poor guy had a blank look on his face and didn't know wtf to do, so I just said it was fine. To add insult to injury, these black macarons have dye that stained my lips and teeth, so my selfies for the night were ruined. The more I thought about this, the more my rage grew, so I asked to speak to the manager. He handled it like a pro and sent over 3 black tea blackcurrant macarons (threw in an extra freebie since there were 3 of us). Btw, they were red in color.If you didn't have time to read the above novel, just know the food and tea are mediocre, the prices aren't justified, and the service is lacking. But you can charge your phone behind the bar if needed.",

    "text": "Doubting between two and three stars here:Food and drinks: definitely two stars.I was extremely disappointed to discover that these huge & attractive tea pots are served less than half full while the cheapest tea is 11 S$. As a huge fan of cream tea, I decided to go for the 19 S$ set which offers two scones, jam and clotted cream plus a tea of your choice (as long it is the 11 $S kind though). I honestly fell disappointed and cheated upon, the scones were tiny but what I thought was even worse was the amount of tea served. Like indicated above, the pots are filled less than half, more like a quarter.I must admit that the scones were nice but considering the price and size I take that as a given, additionally the clotted cream was not really clotted cream.Service and atmosphere: three stars.Overall the service is average, they do provide you with extra lemon slices for your tea when asked but the real reason for going here is the location: this place is in the middle of MBS, which is one of the poshest malls in Singapore and you sit in \"the luxury circle\" surrounded by Prada, Louis Vuitton and others. So it is excellent for people watching and you feel like you are part of that luxury world (what do you want after paying 11 S$ for a empty-ish teapot).So would I go again? Nope as I think it is horribly overpriced but I guess you pay for the location. Any other TWG in Singapore would get two stars.",

This is essentially a tea parlor with some savory and some desserts, the list of teas they carry is mindbogglingly. There are some many different varieties of teas, it can get overwhelming, but just make sure to talk with your server.The food:Chocolate fondant- warm chocolate cake served with a light custard cream and a scoop of homemade vanilla bourbon ice cream. The combination all worked nicely. The cake did feel a little too dense, the ice cream was lighter and easier to eat. For me, it was good, but not great. yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026",

We were there on a weekday afternoon so it was rather empty and we were served promptly. The waiter sits you down, hands you the menu and help with placing the napkin on your lap. The \"classy\" experience they try to portray and carry. Not too bad I must say.The tea menu is ultra long. It's about an A2 size back and front printed with font 12?! AWhat I usually do is have the waiter make some recommendations based on what kind of taste I feel like having today. Otherwise, I will probably take around 1hr to choose! And a Tea Book which is sort of a dictionary for the tea offered. I asked for Sweet and Flowery. He recommended Silver Moon tea and Alfonso Tea. Took the silver moon option, tasted great. Pleasant and smells lovely.My friend had a chocolate earl grey. It did smell like chocolate but tasted funny.Ordered a tarte which was average. They have a decent selection of food, appetizers and snacks too. Love to hang and chill at this cafe with friends. The atmosphere is very classy and soothing, allows you to chat at a comfortable volume unlike the local kopi shops which are great just a tad noisy.",

    "text": "\"TWG Tea is a brand of tea which was established in Singapore in 2008. The company promotes itself as a luxury brand. TWG stands for The Wellness Group.\" - Wikipedia / TWG website.This is a classic example of how money cannot buy you class. The location is great, the furniture is great. These two alone must have cost TWG a pretty penny.The look and feel of the brand screams \"Twinings\". And Twinings have been around for 300 years. TWG, in the age of the internet, surely you cannot expect people to buy into your \"been around since 1837\" myth? Also, for extra credit, homework tonight: Read about the lawsuit filed by another tea company over TWG's logo. Good reads!Back to TWG!Even with the great location and ambience, TWG disappoints in all three areas: Tea, Food and Service._The Tea_Ahhh, a tea shop! Prides itself on the range of tea and knowledgeable staff. What I got was snotty, rude wait staff. No help with the tea selection, no charming conversation about the brand. Just a slightly grotty thick menu with a lot of BIG words describing tea._The Food_The food was overpriced, and just NOT good. Example of overpriced: SGD$32 for a \"Chic Tea Set\"- 3 finger sandwiches, 2 baby scones, 1 glass of iced tea. - SGD$32! ANYWAY....if the finger sandwiches were good, or IF the scones were fresh or IF the iced tea was topped up, it wouldn't be too bad. But nope. It was just NOT good.Macaron - $2 each. Pretty enough, I pointed to the colours not flavours. There were no signs identifying the flavours. I just chose the prettiest ones: Purple and Blue. Later, in my bill, I find out it was vanilla and passion. (Passion?) The macarons were soggy inside and crumbled too easily. Where's the almond meal? Where's the flavour? Where's my macaron!!?Iced Tea (in a glass) SGD$11. I was so beyond disappointed by this time, I had no energy left to rage about the $11 iced tea._The Service_Cold, unattentive service. At some points, there weere 8 staff on the floor, 3 behind the counter looking busy, the other 5 with their backs to the tables, talking to the staff behind the counters. (Wow, sorry about that long sentence.)They didn't seem to know the menu very well, or if they did, they sure didn't share their knowledge. In summary, stop kidding ourselves. TWG (since 2008) is not what it makes itself out to be. May get better, may even live up to it's self-generated hype. But till then, let's spend our money elsewhere.",

    "text": "We went for tea on a weekday to celebrate my friend's birthday. We ordered cakes and tea. My friend did not know the name of the cake, so she pointed at the fridge to highlight that she wanted the red colour cake. The waiter acknowledged. When the cake is served, instead of a cake, the waiter served a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e! My friend told him it was a wrong order. He then served the correct cake. But with no fork. We were a bit surprised at the whole series of event, given that it is TWG.",

    "text": "Everywhere I look something is sparkling: gold, fine china and most precious crystal, which you can likewise purchase. We see the most wonderful wooden tea tins, which are filigree hand-painted. The rear walls are covered with huge tins full of fine teas. It is not surprising at all, that TWG is known for its innovative tea variety.There is, for example, a tea from Japan, which is usually not sold out of the country. Only TWG may offer it outside of Japan. In addition, there are also some sorts of tea, which are offset with gold. Later, when the very nice tea master opens one of the large tins, golden tea dust gets swirled up. A visit to this store is truly an extraordinary tea experience.",
