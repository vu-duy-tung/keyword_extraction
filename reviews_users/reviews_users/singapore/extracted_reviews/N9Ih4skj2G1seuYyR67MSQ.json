    "text": "Outstanding, this is my favourite nasi lemak in Singapore. Uses basmati rice, which absorbs the coconut milk a little better than ordinary jasmine rice. The rice is somehow flavourful without being too heavy with sauce. Sambal was good as well, both sweet and spicy. The other ingredients were about par for the course, but I reckon if you get the rice and sambal right, you can't really go wrong.Queue took about 30 minutes around noon on a weekday.",

    "text": "Last year, I had one the best dishes I've had in my life. This was a much hyped trip to the Adam Hawker Center to try the famous Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak. I have watched many videos including YouTube food blogger, Mark Weins, in my preparation for my trip to Singapore and for this dish. Be warned of the immediate long lines as this is by far the busiest stand in the hawker center. I remember waiting for a half-hour and seeing my friends enjoy their dishes from the other vendors. The wait is long, but luckily, you will be able to relate and potentially make some friends while waiting. Once you reach the register, you will have the option to order one of seven dishes depending on how much variety / portion / adventure you prefer. It begins with the simple \"Flash Meal\" of rice, eggs, cucumbers, and anchovies to the right spectrum of the \"Royal Rumble\" which has all of that + the side dishes and is about 3x the size. I wanted to get the full experience and understand exactly what makes this place unique, different, and regularly visited by the president of Brunei (one of the famous regular customers) of this establishment. Hence, I ordered the \"Royal Rumble.\" - Royal Rumble (+5/5) - This dish was incredible. I had to spend about 5 minutes in the beginning to analyze and take the pictures that it deserved. The Nasi Lamak is packed with coconut steamed rice, anchovies, fried egg, chicken, pandan wrapped leaf thingy, and flaming hot chili paste. It is a one, two, punch. - One of the greatest dishes I've had and a beautiful representation of Singapore and its neighboring cuisines. Make sure to use your left hand to eat this dish as utensils will do no justice. Overall, this is hands down a beautiful dish and one that would make me fly to Singapore for!",

    "text": "Royal rumble ($5.90) - 3.5 starsIt was a 15-20 min wait on a Monday around noon. The good: probably that the fried egg wasn't over cooked (the yolk was all yellow and didn't have a blue-ish grey exterior), the fish was less dry than the one at No 1 Nasi Lemak next door, the rice was light, and there were no peanuts (not a big fan). Otah was alright. But overall I'm not terribly impressed. I guess I'm not picky about my nasi lemak and I'm content with nasi lemak and nasi padang dishes at most places.",

He will sign first \"come here and what do you want\" then \"eat here or take away\" (I was confused, hence putting it out there for future visitors). The rice was a bit soft for my taste, too salty, and with not enough coconut (but you can really smell the pandan as a result). The ikan billis was not sickening for a change. The chicken wing is a chicken wing, I mean there's not many ways to improve on a chicken wing, it's a decent wing as far as wings go. No peanuts. The sauce was the best item, sweet and with incredible scent. I could not indulge fully in the sauce due to avoiding spicy foods at the moment, which may be why I was less than enthusiastic about the whole thing, which I did not consider to be worth 39 minutes of queue (prices have bumped up too, $3.90 for the chicken set). I prefer the nasi lemaks I've had around Joo Chiat. My wife, who ate most of her sauce, thought it WAS worth it, so I'll average our ratings and give it 4*. Personally, I'll try \"No. 1\" next time, its queue is considerably shorter and you get peanuts with your nasi lemak.",

All the media coverage creates unrealistic expectations in diners who flock here only to be disappointed when angels don't appear and next week's 4D numbers fail to materialize in the basmati. \u00a0Don't expect too much, come with an open mind and set your senses free to explore and you will come away satisfied, if not pleasant surprised.It really is just honest to goodness solid quotidian fare. \u00a0Look beyond the bull-@$!# that's been piled on these guys by the media and see it for the single specialty master hawker stall that it is and you'll see what all the fuss is about. \u00a0It's just a local stall that serves good honest nasi lemak. \u00a0No gimmicks. \u00a0No fancy service. \u00a0Just think of all the superlatives that pepper reviews of the latest French restaurant, Italian joint or Spanish tapas place; why don't those same superlatives apply here? \u00a0Based on flavor alone, I see no reasonable explanation why not...unless it's the bull-@#$% these places are throwing in your eyes.Get real, get local, hug your local hawker today and tell him or her you love her. \u00a0Creepy? Yes, but necessary, oooh so necessary!",

    "text": "To find this stall, follow the queue. Okay, maybe not quite. There are two famous nasi lemak stalls in Adam Road Food Centre, side by side. One of them is the first shop of the food centre, this one is the second. Ironically, I find that the better one is in second place. Fair enough as well, as Selera Rasa seems to be open longer hours than the other one does. Most of the time when you're there you ought to be prepared to queue up for a good twenty minutes, because many people come in line not just to order one plate, or two boxes, but a party-load of it. That just shows how good it is. The rice is always at such a good texture, though I find that its taste can be quite a hit and miss sometimes, and lacks that bit of coconut flavour to it. But Selera Rasa more than makes up for whatever's lacking with such good sambal chilli, so the rice becomes a little matter.The gold is in the chicken. The colour is so wonderfully golden, you only have to look at it to tell that it will be such a crispy treat. Inside the chicken is still so juicy and so tender, though a little oily, and it makes you wish you had more than one on your plate - which is why I always ask for two. The ikan bilis is very well fried, and as a personal bonus, don't come automatically with the nuts, as they usually tend to do, thus saving me all that time and effort in removing it.Word on the street is that the nasi lemak from this stall is one of President Tony Tan's favourite food...so 'nuff said I hope!",
