    "text": "I ordered their famous \"The Works\" burger with a side of onion rings. The experience is not memorable at all. Although the burger was done well and had elements that could compliment each other like guacamole, Parmesan chip, sweet onion and 120 day grain fed beef, the flavors was just not exceptional therefore not memorable. I was really looking forward to tasting the flavor of the meat but I was disappointed. The meat lacked seasonings and tasted bland. \u00a0The onion rings were soggy and had no seasonings either so it too tasted bland. I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars for the service and decor but the food will need to be re-evaluated in order for me to give it better ratings.",

    "text": "This place had so much potential! Alas the seating positions were not too ideal. Another table also switched places. The smokiness of the kitchen fills the seating area and the music was a tad too loud. The fan was blowing from don't-know-where and it makes you feel like you're in some hawker centre with serviettes falling around on the floor. The redeeming peripheral is the napkin which allows you to clean your hands so you could hold and embrace into your burger. We ordered the wagyu burger. There is the party option and the shabu option. It's sad that their one for one promotion doesn't even allow you to have one patty and one shabu at the same time, ceteris paribus. Kind of inflexible imo. Anyways burger patty was juicy and good for medium rare and the medium well was well roasted with charred parts on top. The sweet onions and two slices of tomato didn't seem to overpower the meaty beef patty. Fries was upgradable to truffle fries or sweet potato fries for only $1.50! Usual fries was alright albeit a little too salty. Truffle fries was good and servings was generous. Oh how I wish this place was more perfect in user comfort. Service was also mediocre.... the food had potential and I really the next time it'd be better.",

    "text": "Venue and location is nice. Price is not expensive at all imo for this venue. I think that the burger was ok. Tried the classic at 13sgd. There are definitely better burgers but it's ok for the price. One red flag that I for any burger place is when they don't ask how you want it cooked so I know it's gonna be average. The beer hmm I felt tasted a bit watered down. I suppose they make most of the profit from alcohol sold as it's a nice place to hang out. Roasted veggies is meh. Cole slaw is meh.",

Burgers do not come with sides - they have to be added on with extra cost. Water is self service yet they charged us for service. Do consider only if you would like to pay for self service water and no-smiles from staff.",

    "text": "The wildfire seems to be a perfect name for this place - wild for the setting and the loud music, fire for the light underneath these burgers. The setting for this place is definitely more of a classic pub vibe with a lot of loud music pumped in, which means despite the high tables that are great for gathering with people, I don't really see this place as a good location for catching up with people you haven't seen in a while. Service was really mediocre. When they were serving us, they were nice and polite when they were helping us, but were extremely inattentive which was honestly off putting. One of the waitress tried to keep our menus before we ordered which made us feel unwelcomed. In addition when we were done with the meal, I couldn't wave down a single server to get the bill or even clean our plates as they seemed more interested standing by the bar chatting with one another. The food on the other hand actually made me decide to give this place a 3 star instead of a 1 star based on the service. I ordered the classic burger, which was grilled to perfection - juicy and tender with a slight char on the edges. The brioche bun was the perfect compliment to the meat, and the fries were seasoned properly. They also had a large variety of craft beers that seemed interesting but I didn't get to try it due to having a follow up appointment afterwards. 5 stars on the burger, but 1 star on the service, which means if you hear down for a good meal, brace yourself for inattentive service and long waits to just get the check.",
