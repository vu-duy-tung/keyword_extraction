    "text": "Huge portions of sashimi chunks, I'm addicted to their Kaisendon! Always craving for it at least once a month. The portion has gone down a fair bit though, still nice. There's something about their sauce that makes me come back for more, I love how the sauce blends so well with the mixed sashimi I.e. tuna, salmon, fish roe, scallops and 2 other sashimis which I'm not too sure what they are called. U can top up to a Kaisendon SET with extra toppings and a drink for $20. As for the others items on the menu, I would say... U may give it a skip, example their Fried items I.e. Fried Scallop. It was soft and soggy, no hint of scallop at all... Felt like I was eating a mash of flour. Their curry rice was still ok but chicken katsu was a tad hard. They do delivery and u can give them a call prior to collection. I appreciate how fuss free this chain is, order, wait (less than 3 mins) and voila! U get ur food served right to ur table. Service lady was friendly, hospitable and good at doing business ;)Lastly, not sure if this was the case for others, but I had ONE episode of diarrhoea after a meal of the Kaisendon here BUT because it was so nice, despite what happened, I am still back for more! *hopeless fan*",

About what you would expect for the price. \u00a0At first I thought it wouldn't enough for lunch but it was perfect amount to fill me up. \u00a0Strange thing... There were chop sticks and spoons but no napkins. \u00a0Lots of people ordering take out... Glad they take credit cards some places don't.",

    "text": "Teppei is a rather well known Japanese restaurant in Singapore. It is known for its 3 months in advance booking for its $80 multi course dinner. It has since opened Syokudo which offers Japanese dish at more pocket friendly prices. One of the dishes offered at this outlet is KaisenDon ($16.80) which is actually bara chirashi, a mixture of seasoned cubes raw seafood on top of sushi rice.Hotate KaisenDon ($17.80)It was KaisenDon topped with raw scallops on top, served with fresh wasabi. The seafood was fresh and buttery.Seafood Feast ($20)KaisenDon + 1 topping + 1 Japanese green teaThere are 4 choices for the topping : Hotate (Scallop), Negitoro (Minced Tuna), Extra Sashimi, and Ikura (Salmon Roe). I felt that the seafood feast was a great value meal.The Japanese green tea was rich and hot, great for a cold wet night.I had selected KaisenDon topped with Negitoro. It was served with freshly grated wasabi. The seafood was overflowing and fresh in taste. The raw seafood was cubed so it doesn't absorb too much sauce and become too salty. There was also crunchy tempura crumbles in it which gave it extra bit, as well as the juicy ikura.Overall the food was delicious and filling. Service was quick and friendly.",

    "text": "Reading that this place was such a value for money place, I decided to try it. Main thing people order is the kaisendon. The shop does offer curry rice in the menu as well, prices from $10-$16. Tried the kaisendon for $20 which includes a cup of hot/cold tea with one extra topping of your choice. Ala cadre costs $16. The kaisendon came and it was served in small plastic bowl with some rice at the bottom and cubes of the various fishes covering the entire surface of the rice below. The fishes are spread generously but the whole dish being humongous is really exaggerated. Did I mentioned that the place is a little small and cramp? There wasn't even soya sauce or any saucer for you to dip your sushi in. You can eat just the dry wasabi though. I got the $20 option and got a few slices of scallops to add to my kaisendon and a cup of green tea. It wasn't great but it was filling enough. The shop also does deliveries of orders above $200. Sounds like a catering service eh. If they sell cheaper per meal set, I wouldn't mind ordering their service for company functions or just for meetings. When I visited it, there were no Japanese servers, unlike what I've read. The whole set up just look like a catering kitchen. In fact the kitchen could be slightly bigger than the whole seating area. If you'd like to queue less you can call in and just collect it during lunchtime and eat in your office - that's what I figure could be a reason for their existence. But if you were to hang out with your partner or with friends after work or during the weekends, I think there are other better options out there. I wouldn't say this place is a place for budget eaters but the whole set up of the shop seems budget enough.",

    "text": "It is......value for money. I never love Teppei like how everyone loves it. I've been to the original Teppei quite many times, mainly because I have friends who love love his food, but it was never at the point that I was raving about it.This place is the same. Their chirashi is definitely good value for money, I would totally eat it if it is near my workplace as a lunch option. But not enough to make a trip for it. I tried the add-on option of adding negitoro on my chirashi, but I think I'd do without the add-on next time. And note: they charge $0.50 for extra wasabi.",

I like it! It has a generous amount of sashimi (tuna, salmon and i think swordfish) and sushi rice.The staff is mostly japanese, and i noticed a lot of japanese office workers coming here for lunch as well. You get to hear the random shouts in Japanese whenever an order is placed or ready to be picked up. Love it!The place isn't very big, so your best bet is either to do takeaway or avoid the lunch rush. There are only about 10-12 seats in the restaurant and the biggest table seats only 4.",

    "text": "I heard of the rave reviews from my fellow workers about this new Japanese lunch place in Millenia Walk. Boy were they dead right! I only tried one dish, the $16 Kaisendon, and after one bite I was floored at how good it was. I'm not exactly sure what the difference is between Chirashi and Kaisendon, but the premise is the same: Raw fish on top of a bed rice. In this case, it's raw Tuna and Salmon on top of sushi rice. The key one key difference in Teppei's case is the raw fish is drenched with Teppei's special sauce, which is not usually associated with my traditional Chirashi orders at other Japanese restaurants. The sauce is, I would say, a mixture of sauce sauce and vinegar. To tell you honestly, I scarfed down the dish so fast, I could't decipher the ingredients of the sauce.The staff is entirely Japanese which is a testament to the authenticity of the place. Furthermore, there are a dozen of Japanese patrons, especially during lunch, who work at the various Japanese institutions that reside in the Millenia Walk area. Unfortunately, the dining area is extremely small. I estimate it can only fit 15 pax tops. The lunch line is generally long. Advice is to get there early or late afternoon. If not for the small dining space and slightly overpriced dish relative to the food portions you get, this lunch spot is five stars in my book.",
