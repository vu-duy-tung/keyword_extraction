The service by the manager gets the 4th star. I didn't get his name but he made sure our dinner party of 9 was well taken care of. That really made my mum feel good as the meal was her birthday celebration.",

    "text": "For all the years I lived in LA, I never went to or even heard or 25 degrees and now I understand why. There are probably much better burger joints around, like Umami Burger, Father's Office or my personal fave, In-N-Out!That being said, we are in Singapore, where we have none of the above and burgers are generally overpriced. So how does 25 degrees stack up? The #1, which consists of patty, bacon, gorgonzola, caramelised onions and arugula, is quite tasty and sizeable for $14. However, I take issue with the bun to patty ratio. It is too big compared and you can barely fit the burger in your mouth. I usually end up having my burger topless. If their bun was better proportioned, Id give it one more star. The fries and onion rings are pretty good ($5 each or you can order a mix for the same price). The tuna fish burger (#4) was nasty. Really fishy and bland.Once you add in the beer and fries/onion rings, the bill for one person is close to $40.Id come during lunch: burger + fries for $12. The burger patty is a little smaller than the a la carte one, but it's lunch! From 11am-3pmThey also have a decent happy hour from 3-7pm,with certain beers and cocktails discounted, and 1-for-1 specials on certain food itemsIt is also open late, so if you're craving a burger and beer at 1am (and dont Mickey-Ds) this is your place.",

    "text": "Visiting and honestly my boyfriend just needed an American meal to break up the Asian meals overload that we have been experiencing the entire trip. For a burger in Singapore, this place was definitely a pleasant surprise, since we did not know what to expect. Burger was classic American style burger that was juicy, cheese was melty and bun was just great. Ketchup was strange, I think it was a phillipino ketchup, making it so much sweeter, which was not pleasant.The food is decent, its marked much higher than average prices in Singapore honestly. These burgers are priced at the same equivalent of like sushi ($15)....but lets all be honesty. These are burgers, were decent but not amazing. For the price, honestly you should get sushi instead or just a TON of singaporean food (average $5)!! Service is super duper slow, it was not super packed when we went there but it took over 30 minutes to receive our burgers, french fries, and milkshake. The happy hour is decent deal to buy one, get one for the appetizers like french fries which is great but honestly....there is so much food in Singapore....go for street food or Hawker food instead!",

    "text": "This gives me the burger sads :(25 Degrees is a chain that I first tried in Bangkok (it's annexed to the Pullman G Hotel), and I had a fairly good experience there. However, the one thing I do remember was the bun to burger ratio being completely off - and that was definitely the case here.I had the #2 at this location and it was just too much bun. Unfortunately it also was very unwieldy and sogged straight through so I basically had to eat the burger with a knife and fork. Whenever that happens, the burger experience has failed, and it needs to go back to the drawing board to be retooled.I feel like there is potential here, but the bun overload is not working - they need to figure that out first, and then work on building in a better taste profile overall for the burger. Mine was overdone also.At this stage I wouldn't return unless someone told me they've changed the menu/management.",

In any case, I don't eat meat so I had the veggie burger. Looked amazing, but it was whack. The patty tasted like unseasoned broccoli. I love broccoli so if you're gonna do it then spruce it up. The buns, while soft, are too large. Next was my strawberry 'smoothie'. I'm about 95% sure it was more milk than fruit. The added and completely unwanted whipped cream tipped me off. On to the tomato soup...you can't mess up tomato soup can you? Of course you can. It looked red and visually pleasing but had I been doing a blind taste test I never would've known it was tomato soup. Lastly, the cheesecake. Big sigh here folks. It was on some kind of super hard wafer and the cheesecake was bland. The Oreo on top was the most flavorful thing on that plate. It's said when a processed cookie tasted better than...oh a processed cheesecake so never mind. This place is not worth the price tag. Find a street vendor selling ANY other food. Guaranteed it'll be cheaper and tastier. Don't mind the text on the pics. I was excited and texting to my gf lol. The convo went a different direction while eating though...",
