The menu is simple - there's a list of less than 10 burgers to choose from, and each burger comes with a side of potato salad and greens. Portions aren't massive, but they're pretty filling. 2 Blur Guys also serves desserts such as brownies and ice cream. The restaurant is nothing fancy, but it serves as a functional place to grab dinner at with friends.",

I had the prime beef with streaky bacon, which looked to be the best burg on the menu, but unfortunately they snuck some sort of truffle flavour in there (can we stop with that nonsense already???) and there wasn't a good burger sauce to give it a better taste (anything would have helped - BBQ, Tomato, Mustard).So whilst they have the cooking down, they need to work on the construction of the burger somewhat.The handful of wedges was a bit meagre and the wait for the food was on the extreme-side. However as there is only 2 guys, that's probably part of the experience, and with it being Singapore, service is never on the awesome-side.",

    "text": "Eat Until \"Blur\"Oh, the humble hamburger. How it's evolved from a meat patty, melted cheese between a toasted sesame bun to a level that's..... gourmet worthy. We love a good burger bar and was gutted when discovering that Mojo Burps, one of if not our favorite burger joint, had closed. Since than, we've given a few other places a shot without much satisfaction, UNTIL NOW!We decided to do a takeaway because we've seen just how saucy their burgers can get and decided we should do a takeaway to avoid messing ourselves in public. The Wife had the Prime Beef Burger with Foie Gras while I went with a more Non-traditional, smoked salmon burger. Prime Beef with Foie Gras ($24.95)OMG. First the basics. The bun was nicely toasted and thanks to the Foie Gras, the top bun was flavored with the Foie Gras oil, which soaked in every bit of flavour it had to offer. The patty was a spot on. An inch thick patty, well seasoned and perfectly cooked (we had ours medium rare). The patty had a great fat to meat ratio, ensuring that it didn't taste dry or chewy. Consistency of the mince was good as well, avoiding any portion of clumpy meat or overly mushed mince. The results? An extremely juicy patty that constantly dropped juices down the side of our mouths. The Foie Gras was pretty generous, with 2 thick slices, which added richness to the burger. Though not the highest quality of Foie Gras, they were still pretty good. The cheese was perfectly melted while the relish used added a nice sour kick to the burger, helping to cut the richness of the burger. Smoke Salmon Burger ($12.50)I was expecting maybe 6 slices of salmon, max, with tons of avocado. Turns out, it was the complete opposite!The smoked salmon was folded into a one inch thick patty while the avocado was a thin layer between salmon and bun. It was a smoke salmon lovers delight! Only thing I wished was for more avocado and more sauce and you could barely taste it over the salmon. It did need that bit of sourness to help cut the powerful taste of the salmon. Also, it did feel a little strange either smoked salmon between a burger bun, might have been \u00a0more \"traditional\" between a bagel but hey, It still tasted good but I have zero complains with the generosity. Every order also comes as a set, which comes with a drink, salad and awesome wedges with cheese sauce. Hands down for now, this is my favourite burger joint. It may not be the most price friendly restaurant but it's definitely worth it.",

    "text": "Came here with two church mates as one of them wanted to try out burgers for dinner around 7.00 pm on a Saturday. Located walkable distance from Tanjong Pagar MRT and next to famous ramen chains. After exploring the menu, I decided to order Prime Beef with Streaky Bacon. Yes, I am a fan of bacons. And Gruyere cheese sounds unfamiliar. For the beverage, I asked one of the staffs whether the ice lemon tea was homemade and when she answered it was, I ordered that.Price wise here was a bit steep. For the meal, you can either get the wedges for the price listed on the menu or add-on for other side dishes. I decided to try truffle fries with the burger.For the home made ice lemon tea, it is highly recommended. But unfortunately they placed too much ice cubes inside the glass that lost its taste after 20 or so minutes. Could probably ask them for less ice. For the truffle fries, it was good if consumed before 10 minutes. Unfortunately I left them out in the air for long and they turned soggy even though the truffle fries were of thin cuts. For the beef patty, I ordered it medium rare as that is what I normally choose for burgers. Sadly it was not as juicy as other Yelpers had mentioned. The bacon was chewy to my liking and the buns were nicely baked. Store wise, it is not so spacious and could only contain maximum 15 customers. So to avoid the crowds, you might need to come earlier. Portion was reasonable and it did satisfy my hunger.",

One guy came to show us a table, was chill when we wanted another. Was hard to understand his accent when we asked the bestseller. But the taste of the burgers swept us away. Ordered a steak burger and a puller pork burger. Steak burger had superb truffle infused mayonnaise and steak patty (well done) was moist and didn't have the raw taste. Pulled pork reminded me of kong bah (black sauce braised pork). The tenderness draws me in for a bite after another. The lettuce inside was boiled, goes well with the pork instead of conventional salad kinda raw lettuce.Love the crispy potato wedges. Overall it was a very satisfying meal!(:",

Yum.. every order come with garden green salad and wedges potato topped with gruyere cheese (the type of cheese which I'm not sure how to spell it, but anyway it goes so well with the wedges potatoes :)If you don't like wedges, you can change it with truffle fries (add $2.50) or french fries (add $1.50) - but in my opinion, wedges potato is da'bez! \u00a0And come try their homemade ice lemon tea, super fresh and tangy-sweet, such a perfect lemon tea I've ever tried so far! ahahah.And \u00a0not forgetting the very friendly staff, who even notice my need before I asked - when the tabasco was finished in our table and I was still pouring the last drop, the staff came to my table and offered me a new bottel of tabasco! \u00a0Wow, very very good service! \u00a0i am impressed - and stomach is happy! \u00a0Will come back and I might try their salmon avocado burger \u00a0=D",

We were however pleasantly surprised at the burgers! The beef patties were suitably thick and juicy! Flavorful!! The burgers/patties aren't large, so if you are looking for something substantial, these aren't. nonetheless, these burgers were still satisfying! The portobello one seemed nice (my friend's order) and I would go back to try this one. The truffle fries were good too, although I found the smell to be a little overpowering. Haha! One side note, the salad was a little oily, which was strange. We sat outside, so thankfully it didn't feel cramped. Will go back!!",

    "text": "Apart from the other reviews, this small burger bar also does quiches and quick bites to go, which they will heat up for you. The mushroom quiche I got tasted good, but it was a little small and I scoffed it down quickly.I came here on a Friday afternoon around 4pm so it was really empty. Staff were a little bit lacklustre in their service attitude, but otherwise the place looked quite appealing and I wouldn't mind dropping by for a full meal if I'm ever around the area.",

    "text": "I came here today for a spur of the moment lunch plan with a friend. As soon as we walked in we were seated. Unfortunately, it was in a cramped little corner. We ordered our food and though it came rather quickly, I wouldn't say it was the best. It was overloaded with truffle mayo and the meat was two soft and crumbled out of the burger. The bread ended up getting soggy because how juicy the burger was. All in all... I have a coupon for this place from pickatsg but I don't think I'll be using it. #disappointed",

    "text": "With just four tables in a tiny space, Two Blur Guys isn't trying very hard perhaps in this newly competitive Duxton/Tanjong Pagar area (Soooo many good things to eat around here), but maybe it doesn't have to. I come to Duxton a lot and frequently walk over to the Orchid Hotel to eat at Teppei or Tonkotsu King. So I was pleasantly surprised to see this tiny space along the Tanjong Pagar stretch.I wish they did more marketing, or maybe it's good that they didn't, because when I started to hear friends excitedly discuss the burgers and desserts here I was intrigued enough to go check it out. There's a small selection of interesting (mostly Aussie) beers and wines, and the cakes and tarts like the Lamington are good.Alas I have been too full from ramen usually to ever eat a full meal here, but I'm going to check out the burgers next time especially now that I've found out that Singapore's elusive food extraordinaire Jimmy Chok is involved here in some way or other.",
