I have been here around 8pm with friends; the service is unsatisfied as while we are still eating, the waitress cleans our dishes without asking. I guess they are rushing for closing.We had soondubuchigae (soft tofu stew), ramen and gimpap (korea rice roll, similar to sushi). We were served for 6 side dishes - kimchi, anchovies, cucumbers kimchi, mashed potato, bean curd skin and seasoned vegetables. Even the portion is small for each side dish, but it is refillable on demand, our favour is anchovies and mashed potato. Although the service is bad, we still enjoy the dishes and it is still recommended to those who really like Korean Cuisine.",

    "text": "I casually mentioned to my family the whole idea of eating jjajangmyeon on Black Day, which falls on the 14th of April every year. For Koreans, 14th of February is known as Valentine's Day 14th March known as White Day and 14th April Black Day, and these three days are days in which girls give guys chocolates, followed by the guys returning the favour and lastly a day for singles to gather and 'mourn' their singlehood. Although the idea is meant to egg singles to be more open to dating, it still seem to be a fun excuse to gather, as there were many Koreans that day gathering to eat the noodles together. The jjajangmyeon here is really tasty, and comes in two different sizes-the normal serving for one, or two, and a really huge serving big enough to feed five or more people. Eating this black noodles, however, require care. Another must try here is the kimbab (about $12). Beautifully made into teardop shaped \u00a0rolls, the kimbabs here are stuffed with succulent ingredients, and the sticky rice holds them all together in place. The owners are Koreans, and hence the food has the authentic delicious taste which is not found in many other Korean-run restaurants.Opening hours: Daily 11.30am - 2.30pm, 6pm - 10pm.",

I will definitely return given the quality, service, and location. One of the best Korean restaurants in singapore.",

The places I've been to in Singapore just don't match up. The ban chan variety is smaller and they somehow taste too salty or like they were bought at a supermarket. And they only have white rice here while the places in LA serve mixed grains. Service could be better - they never seemed to hear us - we had to yell from the table next to the table they were clearing - and when we ordered extra rice they gave it to us with an unpleasant frown. Not sure what I did to offend them.",

    "text": "Wanted to eat something Korean and after reading the good reviews here, I decided to check this out with my family in tow. We had:Pork Ribs Stew - it's a big pot of steaming stew that has vegetables and mushrooms in them. The waitress who served it would even proceed to remove the meat from the long rib bones for us. So every scope is just with really tender and flavourful pork meat and yummy soup. Excellent with some rice. Spicy Pig Trotters - it's a huge plate of pig trotters that's cut into chunks. I eat only the meaty bits and if you eat it with the lettuce leaves and garlic slices, it's wow wow wow! Not too spicy but has enough kick! Nice!!Bimbimbab - I've heard many people loving this rice combi so I ordered one with spicy pork to try. I'm won't order it again but I can see the draw of this dish. I guess it's not for me. Beef Gravy Soup - this has Korean vermicelli in it. Theirs is thicker than regular Chinese ones. The soup base is actually quite sweet and it really quite a nice dish. My girl loves it!Potato Pancake - this side dish is no side show! It's crispy and really tasty! My other girl loves it so much that she declared that when we return again, she is having 3, all by herself! I support her! HehThey served us 6 side dishes and they are:Kimchi - I don't like kimchi so no commentsPotato Salad - theirs has raisins in them so it's kinda sweet. Theirs also has bits of nut and the overall taste is just great!Garlic Vege - it's simple fare of saut\u00e9 green vege with garlic but it's so good!Spicy Ikan Bilis - it's sticky and a bit spicy and crunchy with white sesame seeds, how to go wrong?Peanuts - theirs is coated with this sticky black sauce that makes the taste interesting. Nice. Preserved Cucumber - it's refreshingly cold and crunchy too. Reminded me of our local acah. We couldn't finish all our food and the lady boss was happy to pack it for us. Many reviews complained of poor service but while service was not top notch, it's really quite ok. They gave us a 20% voucher for returning customers and we will be definitely be back to use it!",

    "text": "Koreatown was comfort food for me in Manhattan, so now I find myself craving Korean food often in Singapore - especially as it's much cheaper than New York! Togi hit the spot & I'll be back for more spicy soup cravings. I've been to both the Mosque St and the Triple One branch, and I have to say I kind of prefer the Triple One branch: the atmosphere is spacious and airier, and the service is better, for food of similar quality and prices. This Togi is tucked in a street full of predominantly Chinese eateries, with cosy and homely Korean-inspired cutesy decor. It isn't that large - maybe 10 or so tables?- explaining the lines here at night. We went for a late lunch around 1pm and there were only 2-4 tables filled. The kitchen was preparing some takeaway orders too. The soups are the standout here: I'd advise shying away from other dishes. I was a little more \"adventurous\" today and we shared a kimchi pancake with seafood ($12) and bibimbap ($12) along with my standard order of seafood tofu soup ($13). The seafood tofu soup was, as usual, amazing. Its spiciness had a kick to it, and it included cockles and 2 large prawns (unpeeled! We felt so lazy to peel it at first lol), and a big hunk of silky soft tofu. Some restaurants include kimchi for the spice in the soup, but this tasted more like a chili sort of spice. This soup has never disappointed me. The other two dishes were not great - the kimchi pancake was paper-thin and I could not taste or see any bits of seafood at all. Perhaps a more accurate description is kimchi pancake. If you're craving for seafood, order the seafood pancake ($18) instead, which was terrific when I had it at the Triple One branch, thicker and layered with prawns, squid and so on. The bibimbap was also disappointing - the beef used was ground/minced beef, not beef slices or bulgogi, which made the whole dish quite mushy. There's also a strange flavor to the dish, besides the spiciness of the gochujang, that reminded me of soy? I've never tasted that before in other bibimbaps. Definitely affordable price for a stone bowl bibimbap, though I've tasted better ones at food courts. I intend to try the bossam or bbq next time!",

The restaurant is owned by Koreans and you can actually taste the difference with those you order at food courts. Also, if you are a Kpop fan, you get to watch music shows like Music Bank or Inkigayo on their big television screen! Sometimes, they also play popular music videos of idols, which explains the increasing number of teenagers at the restaurant.One of my favourite dishes from Togi is the pancake! Though a simple dish, it's tasty, chewy and full of flavour. Something I will recommend to you! Even the spicy kimchi stew is pretty good. I personally love their kimchi and will even buy a pack to two home!",

    "text": "I haven't had good Korean food in a long while, so decided to pop by this restaurant based on a friend's recommendations.Service (by the predominantly Chinese staff) was passable. The side dishes here are free flow (which gave me the same feeling when I had Korean food in Canada). I tried the seafood pancake, which was thick and fluffy. Most importantly, it contained a lot of crunchy seafood that made this pancake such a treat. Next, we tried the kimchi soft tofu stew, which was really delicious and not too spicy. My friend had the ginseng chicken soup, and I had the chance to give it a try as well. The soup was wonderful and definitely not MSG laden, and the chicken portion was generous as well. Finally, we tried the spicy bbq pork, which had a good mix of spiciness and overall very delicious as well.Overall, this is a great place for Korean food!",

    "text": "Big winners: the chapchae and kimchi pajun were really, really good. The soon doobu had good flavor, but wasn't spicy. I would think that could be easily remedied by asking them to make it extra hot next time. Strangely, they were out of the regular kalbi on the bone, at 7pm on a Saturday night. For such a staple dish, you'd think they'd want to have plenty of it during the peak dinner hour. So we had the boneless kalbi, which was tender but surprisingly under-seasoned/marinated. I wonder if they were just overrun and didn't marinate long enough. Anyway, that was kind of a disappointment. They don't take reservations, so there was a bit of a wait, but no more than 10-15 minutes for a party of four. All in all, I'd go back, but I wasn't blown away.",

    "text": "This place has the best Soondubujigae (spicy beancurd stew). Really. For 12 bucks, you get a bowl of well seasoned, a little spicy, tofu soup with generous amount of seafood (prawn, clams, squid). An egg is cracked into it as well. Honestly I only need a bowl of this and I can finish a pot of rice. The soup is as good if not better than those I've eaten in Korea.I find it hard to fault any dishes they have here. Seafood pancake is good, grilled pork belly is good, hot pot stew is good too. You should just order everything really. This is my go to place for Korean food anytime. Till I find a better one. :)",

    "text": "The bulgogi was pretty good. It didn't have any sweet potato glass noodles but there was a lot of meat and it was well-seasoned. The side dishes were also good and bottomless, especially the kimchi, miniature sardines, and green beans. The Kimchi buchimgae was a little thick for my tastes and the haemul pajeon the people sitting next to us ordered was 3 times thicker than usual. The prices were reasonable. We were sitting next to another party of two at a four-person table so it felt like I should have been talking to the person next to me because he was much closer than my date.",
