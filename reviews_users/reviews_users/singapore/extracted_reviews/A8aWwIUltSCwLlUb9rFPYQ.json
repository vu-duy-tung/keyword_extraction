Weekday thalis are value for money too.I think that they serve the best dosa in singapore which is paper thin, crunchy and the accompanying sambar tastes very refined. Service is good with outdoor sitting available too.",

The papdum was not crunchy cause it was laid on top of the naan. The sweet dish was great. Overall great value for money!",

Slightly sourish and very tasty.2) Samosa Chaat - another not-so cold fish with fried samosa bits and chick peas. Also sourish and very tasty tooMains:3) Aloo Gobi - my all time favourite! They do theirs well here. 4) Spinach with Cottage Cheese - smooth blend of spinach with chunks of cottage cheese. Good flavour too!5) Mushroom Curry (I forgot the name - this is very awesome! I couldn't stop eating it!!!We ordered Naans to go with the curries and their Naans are soft and fluffy. The butter and garlic ones are even more wonderful with the extra flavours on the top! Good!!!It's not cheap but a good place to bring vegetarians.",

    "text": "Going to an Indian vegetarian restaurant can be a problem for me because I am illiterate to the menu, especially those without diagrams. However, after the last visit and reading up a bit about the cuisine, I am feeling more at ease when dining at these places. Founded in 1965 in India, Raj landed on the Singapore island in 1988, serving Indian vegetarian food from ....North, South East West of India??? (the website says so)Before you start navigating through the menu, it is good to have some Papadam (5 at $1.80) to silence the growling stomachs. After all, everyone may also need some time to decipher the long list of food, especially when the menu at Raj is more extensive than Ananda Bhavan. So, the million-dollar question is : What to order? Well, the simplest step is to pick any items from the Dosai list. For instance, this Butter Marsala Dosai ($4.70) is a good set that will fill up any average adult. Its a typical triangular crepe filled with potatoes chunks, tomatoes cooked down to a mash. They come with the three chutneys-mint, tomato and coconut. Alternatively, go for theplain-flavoured ones like Sada Dosai ($2.90), Paper Thosai ($3.80-pic above), Garlic naan ($3.20-pic below) and choose from the array of vegetarian curry pots for dipping. The paper thosai is suitable for those who like it crisp but it is also more greasy to the touch. Ours came as shiny as a bald man's head that reflected the dining lights very well.Our first dip was Palak paneer ($10), a familiar North Indian dish that consists cubes of home-made cottage cheese immerged in rich spinach puree. It had the smoothest texture out of the 3 and received the most number of thumbs-up at the table. But it should be consumed in moderation as it was extremely savory. Alternatively, there is the Dhal Butter Fry ($7.50) which had a slightly tangy flavor imparted by the spices in the pool of simmered lentil gravy.The chef's specialty--Soya Keemar Mattar ($10), was a delectable pool of minced tofu and green peas (mattar) in an aromatic semi-solid gravy. It had a thicker consistency than the dhal butter but was less salty. The dhals were all tasty, but we underestimated the sizes of the dhals curry and still ended up with at least half a pot.In order not to contribute to the amount of food Singaporeans are wasting each year, we ordered more sada dosai and also the above Sadam Uthappam ($3.30), a thicker version of dosai. Imagine tu-tu kueh minus the filling. One experiences a sharper tang even though both Uthappam and Dosai are made from fermented batter of rice and lentils.And I am proud to say that all the food were 100% polished off at this farewell class dinner=D The slight hiccups in the service did not deter the mood as everyone chatted merrily into the night. While Indian vegetarian cuisine may not be the cup of tea for everyone, I believe it was a good cultural experience. Should you be interested to try out, Raj is a good and affordable place to begin with!",

    "text": "This is a vegetarian Indian restaurant near Biopolis. Despite not being vegetarian, I have found the selection of menu items to be extensive and have thoroughly enjoyed the items I have tried on my two visits to date. The prices are appropriate for what you get, especially relative to the area. Although it is frequently crowded during lunch time, the service has been reasonable and the space is not cramped by any means. There is plentiful seating indoors and out. As for the food itself, my favorite thus far is the masala baby corn. It had the right amount of pop from the sauce and spices, while also being nutritional. I even ate cauliflower here, which I would never eat back home, due to its tasty preparation. This place taught me a valuable life lesson. That is, if you dump the right spices and sauces over just about any vegetable, it will taste excellent. I look forward to visiting again.",

We sat down and asked the waiter if we could order, he came over and the first thing I ordered was the Behl Puri - he immediately said you can't order that because it's too busy for that and then walked away. I was very shocked! They are understaffed and cannot handle a big volume of people. We finally waited another 15 minutes to flag down another waiter who did take our order including the Behl Puri. I don't recommend going here if you want a quick bite to eat for lunch. You need a long lunch break for this!",

    "text": "If you want vegetarian comfort food in Singapore, Raj is the place. From my 40+ family man perspective, the things that make it a winner are:1) Clean and well maintained. No adverse post meal effects till date, and we have been there more than 50 times this past year2) prompt and friendly service3) child friendly- plenty of high chairs, and they provide plastic plates and spoons for kids4) diverse menu covering North and South Indian cuisine5) food is tasty and fresh, and does not use too much oil, thus obviating the need for mugs of hot tea after the meal. 6) Booze to dull the senses when the kids are acting up - this is a tad overpriced thoughOur more commonly ordered items here include dosas, idlis, Chana bhatura, Rajma, and 2 dishes we have not seen elsewhere: palak kofta - which consists of kofta made with spinach in a tomato gravyPhaldhari kofta - made from raw bananas, in the same(?) gravy - see below.For weekday lunches their South Indian thaali is quite good, although a lot of food for a middle aged tummy.The few minuses are:1) No fresh juices or lemonade2) many of their tomato based gravies taste suspiciously similar, making one wonder if they are just adding the potatoes/kofta/veggies to a ladle dished out from the same giant pot3) No South Indian curries or veggies on their dinner menu, and thaali is only available for lunch on weekdaysSolid thumbs up from me.",
