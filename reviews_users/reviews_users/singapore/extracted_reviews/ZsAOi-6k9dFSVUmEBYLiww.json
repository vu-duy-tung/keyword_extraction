    "text": "I'm confident enough to say that Guzman y Gomez is one of the better Mexican chains in Singapore. Sure, it started in Australia and one of the owners is from New York, but it all comes down to taste and they do it good here.You won't find weird ingredients like roasted mushrooms in the burritos. They have the option of spicy or mild chicken burritos. The burrito size, though slightly smaller and pricier than what you'd see in the US, is Singapore standard and to be expected. They had guacamole available when I was there (THANK YOU.) They have a publicly accessible salsa bar. The chef in the back was entertaining by singing along with the fun pop playlist they had playing in the background. This place makes me happy, I am a fan, and that's all that matters.",

The meats (beef, chicken, and also pork) are well-seasoned and tasted delicious. Tortilla chips and salsa was nice too. Portions are fairly generous. Will return!",

    "text": "In a sentence? Run of the mill fast food Tex-mex. I'm a sucker for tacos. There, I said it. I was irresistibly drawn to the cheerful signage, like a moth to a flame, tempting me with the possibility of a small piece of habanero-laced tortilla heaven. The tacos? They're pedestrian, average, and will generally satisfy your hunger. The tacos are otherwise nothing to phone home about. You can help yourself to as much salsa, onions and cilantro as you like, so I found myself adding a huge amount of all three on the tacos. I found the barramundi a little on the dry side, and the tortillas did not taste like they were grilled. Otherwise, pricing is cheap for mexican food in Singapore type standards. Another thing to note is they are CASH ONLY!My spidey-sense tells me a Mexican food craze is slowly sweeping Singapore. In the past year, competition has heated up and a couple more places opened. A new GYG outlet will soon open at Raffles Place. Cheap, fast, and you're quickly out the door. Okay if you're here for a quick lunch, but there are joints in town that serve better.",

But when I got there shortly after 5, I was turned away by staff saying that the promo ended at 5. No end time was indicated on the flyer and the staff \u00a0acknowledged that but still said the promo was over. Talk about false advertising! !! I told her to tell the manager that this was wrong but she casually dismissed me (the staff were having some kind of celebration and totally ignoring the customers) so I have zero confidence that she will pass my feedback.

    "text": "And so I finally managed to get a burrito from the much hyped Guzman y Gomez. I actually work in Asia Square so you would think I'd have gotten one sooner. But the company I work for provides lunch and I've always been too lazy to brave the humongous queues at lunchtime. I would have loved a burrito dinner but unfortunately GYG has chosen the regrettable closing time of 4pm, meaning their burritos were too far outside my usual meal schedule.Until now. A light lunch in the office meant I got hungry before 4pm. Wonderful opportunity, I thought to myself. I rushed down to the waiting arms of the service stuff and placed my order as quickly as I could.And boy was I disappointed. These Chipotle-style CalMex burrito joints have been popping up recently so GYG is not the only horse race in town. I'm sad to say that it's well and truly eclipsed by Boat Quay's Hombre Cantina and Keong Saik's Muchachos. I found the tortilla to be dry and doughy and the fillings to be lacklustre. There was just way too much rice. You know when you get halfway through something and you're kind of sick of eating it? Yeah. That's never happened to me with a burrito before, not even at the much-maligned MexOut. One slight saving grace was the pork filling which is pretty moist and tasted fresh (I guess because they churn out so many burritos). The service was also not much of a bonus. My order was messed up and although they changed it without fuss I found the order-taking and execution process to be unfriendly and devoid of charm or interest.Thumbs down to GYG, I won't be back.",

    "text": "Dear Guzman y Gomez. Thank you. Thank you so much. I totally get you. I totally get the food your restaurant serves. I am a fan. Hey, I love Singapore, but after eating at your restaurant, a twinge of homesickness for California, floods into my brain.  \u00a0 \u00a0The first bite of your gorgeous fish taco and bam, there I am at a little taco stand in Malibu. (Later to go onto a pretty famous \"chain\") Second bite, bam, I am in Rosarito Beach. Third bite, hello Baja! \u00a0It's up and down Mexico/ California coast line...it is just right. After devouring my soft shell fish taco........I am onto the highly recommend pork soft shell taco.  \u00a0 \u00a0 First bite.... this is Pork carnitas taco is very good. The consistency is just right. Chunky, creamy smooth. The lard makes the pork meltingly tender with the right amount of spicy heat. Oh yum, add this little pork gem enhanced with a swig of Pacifico Beer. I See that you do know the perfect pairing.  \u00a0 \u00a0Your guacamole, yep. Just like home. So fresh. The tortillas, the chips. Exactly right. \u00a0 \u00a0The pulled beef burrito once again, a hit. Am I in 'the Mission' gorging myself in one those world famous stands? Nope. It's an sleek, well located, Mexican Restaurant in Singapore.  \u00a0 \u00a0A couple of other things I liked. The restaurant is Sparkling clean. Great staff, veryFriendly, knowledgable, and expeditious. Restaurant had indoor/ outdoor seating. Really nice water feature outside, street side. Oh, also love the selection of Mexican Beers and sodas. Nice touch. \u00a0 So again, thank you for doing it right. Pssssst, they don't get you way out there. Hope you open a little takeout place out in Novena. That would be awesome!",

    "text": "Among the best Mexican places in town based on taste. Two bugbears - one they can't control. GYG is at the Asia Square food court that is mobbed by people from other nearby office complexes including One Raffles Quay and MBFC where the selection is not as good. So finding a place to sit is difficult at lunch time. The second problem is with trying to get the sauces, and coriander, jalape\u00f1o or onion garnish. Basically you pay and move to a crowded area on the right, and wait to collect your order. Only then can you collect napkins, forks and knives, and add on sauces and garnishes. So wait you must! Then queues intersect, chaos follows, and dull-face, the sullen manager stares straight past his jostling customers - least interested in fixing things since business is thriving amid limited competition! So you can't take a guest or a friend if you care about the ordering experience or finding seating.Great place to stop in on your own and bring back a bowl or a burrito. The grilled spicy chicken and milder grilled barramundi in bowls or in tacos (both gluten free) or burritos are both tasty, fast and fresh!",

    "text": "Have to agree with Alex's review below. Ate here twice during lunch hour. First time was a week after the opening and the next visit was about a month later. I tried the slow roasted pork soft tacos and the spicy grilled chicken burrito. The tacos were ridiculously small and reminded me of some of food I ate at Lucha Loco, except that the latter is a taqueria so I'm not entirely surprised at the portion sizes. For a chain that's trying to sell breakfast and lunch only vs. the higher profitability dinner crowd, these portions aren't going to cut it. The pork was flavorful but the side of guacamole (again in a ridiculously small container) was bland. The chicken burrito I ate at my second visit was kinda unappetizing too and like Alex, I didn't feel like finishing it and decided to pick it apart. Muchachos is still my top pick for Mexican food at a reasonable price in Singapore. Unless Guzman steps up their game, I give them a year at best.",

Guzman y Gomez within walking distance from our home there. It was one of the few places we could get take away. \u00a0It was not the same as home, but it was as close as we could get, and they would turn up the heat on our dishes by adding peppers to our food. \u00a0I was excited to here they had a place here in Singapore as all of the places here just don't fill the Tex-Mex void quite well.The GYG here is not like the GYG in Brisbane. \u00a0Burritos are much smaller (not a complaint for me but might be for others) the toppings on the nachos were different and a bit bland, and the menu seemed not to offer as much variety ( but I do understand this is in a food court not a stand alone). \u00a0I was underwhelmed by the toppings as well as the flavor. \u00a0Brisbane branch (even without the extra heat) had a great tangy/bit smokey flavor. \u00a0The chips were not as crispy (though maybe the humidity to blame?). And the rice in the burrito was not as light. \u00a0I gave it 3 stars as I know they can be better, I've had it, it is better! \u00a0But unfortunately, it's not like mcdonalds, no matter where you go a Big Mac tastes like a Big Mac. \u00a0GYG may need a bit of time to get there.",
