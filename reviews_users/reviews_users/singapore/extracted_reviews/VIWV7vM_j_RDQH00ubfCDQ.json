    "text": "This is my favorite place for Korean Fried Chicken.The chicken is made to order and so it does take a while before the chicken is served. When it is not so crowded (half filled), it takes about 20 minutes for the chicken to be served. When it is crowded (all tables are taken), it may be a 30-60 minutes wait. Order the nacho fries to ease the hunger pangs while waiting for the chicken. It is cheesy and a bit nacho spicy. Yums!I have tried the Nest Snow and it is just average and only good for instagram picture taking. It is just chicken tenders swimming in a pool of cream sauce which is tasty. It can get a bit jelak after a while as it is very rich cream sauce. It goes by weight so there is no fixed pieces of chicken tenders.The wings are my favorite as it is just wings and nothing else. The fried chicken is a good item to order if you want to feel full. It has all the chicken parts including breast meat, thigh, drumstick, wings and even the throat? There are so many pieces that it is hard to count. Roughly 12-14 pieces?For the flavors my favorite is the garlicky as it is a bit sweet and spicy. Even the original is a bit spicy. So when you order the spicy chicken, it is doubly spicy but still manageable. I like how it is served with rice cakes (for garlicky wings) and sweet potatoes (for spicy chicken).You can have 2 flavors if you order the fried chicken - original and spicy or original and garlicky. How much to order?On my first visit, we ordered the Nest Snow and garlicky wings to share among 5 adults. It was just nice and probably 80% full. Subsequent visits Fried chicken and wings \u00a0and cheese fries for 2 adults and 2 kids. We could not finish it and tabao 8 pieces of chicken back. Fried chicken and cheese fries for 2 adults. We managed to finish it only because the guy could eat. I believe we would have 4-6 pieces as leftover if it was just 2 girls. \u00a0They do serve water in a jug which is always nice. Rice is also available for $2 a bowl. This is not on the menu and you need to ask for it. It is still a popular spot and you can see a line waiting for a table during the peak meal hours.",

    "text": "Even more Korean Fried Chicken invading Orchard Road.After incursions into Chinese and Taiwanese territory, Chir Chir (pronounced chi-ruh chi-ruh) has finally entered Singapore. A well known Korean fried chicken chain, they specialize in fusion-ish fried chicken dishes.I ordered their most popular dish, the Nest Snow, a mashup of fried chicken tenders topped with some gravy, corn, peas and broccoli, mashed potato and lots and lots of whipped cream and cheese. I was particularly amused by the special tongs provided for chicken grasping. The other dish was the honey grape salad, that was a pretty interesting combination of cheese, honey and grape halves, but it arrived in rather skimpy portions. The menu listed the dishes for sharing 2-3 pax, but I think each dish only barely feeds 2, rather than 3 people. There was a cheese fire chicken feet menu item, but unfortunately it was sold out for the day.I was here in early Feb when the outlet was around a few weeks old, and they seemed to have some teething problems. Food took close to an hour to arrive, and wait staff delivered the wrong dishes to the wrong tables.All in all, I wasn't blown away like every other review blog was. In summary, it's just rather pricey fast food fried chicken that could do with slightly larger sharing portions.",

    "text": "Chir Chir is definitely a good place to drink and chill and they definitely have a great selection of food (mainly chickens) and beverages. It is a solid pick for Korean Fried Chicken and a solid dinner pick. The chickens are definitely tasty and the soy garlic chicken is probably the best flavor there. Interestingly enough, their Cajun Boneless Chicken Strips and Plain Crispy Fried Chicken are pretty damn good too. The meat was juicy and contrasted very well with the savory fried skin.You are able to pick a combo of two flavors for fried chicken, (so you get to choose either soy garlic and plain or spicy and plain). I personally prefer the soy garlic and plain over the spicy because the spicy ones can get too spicy after a few bites. Beware though the chickens usually take around 30 minutes to make depends on the crowds.They also have a wide selection of other food besides fried chicken like pasta and salad which look like it's well worth trying for me in the future. We had a side of cheese fries which were not so great though. The drink menu is also nice and large so you'll never get thirsty. My favorite is Lady Killer, it's made of a popular beer from Korea. The chicken takes a while to come out but they earn that right just by taste alone. One of the best fried chicken places in Singapore. I go here quite often, it can be for your large group hangouts as well as your one-to-one date. I recommend large crowds because then you can order every item and sample a bit of each.From the outside the place looks deceptively small but when you walk in there is plenty of seating. They even have a few community tables that can accommodate large groups. The place was a little too bright for my taste but it didn't quite affect my enjoyable meal experience.",

I went at 3 pm in the afternoon and could barely hear my friend who was seated across from me. A polite request to reduce the volume ended up with an \"ok\" but nothing was changed. We left because the music was giving us a headache. I am an EDM and trance club goer and this is ridiculous!",

Decided to try this place out as I was craving for fried chicken and I happened to be at the Somerset area.Ordered Garlicky Chicken and Berry Purple Tok!Tok!. The beverage was average. The soda was way stronger than the mix. I decided to go for non-alcoholic. Before walking towards my assigned seating, I had a glimpse of the drink and so decided to order it even though it was costly. The waitress said that it will be four cups when poured from the glass jug and since I was thirsty, I didn't think more about whether I could finish it up. A few minutes later, another waitress appeared in front of me and did the mix. Verdict, not too bad but I wouldn't go for more as it was pretty expensive and the ice melted pretty fast in the jug.The waitress also warned me about the portion of the Garlicky Chicken. Had to wait for about an hour before my dish was served. Other tables around me had their foods way before mine even though we were seated almost the same time. Verdict, the thighs are the best as it was crunchy and flavorful. But the other parts I wasn't thrilled about it. I was given about 12-15 parts (combination of breast, thighs, wings) and could only consume 1/3 of it and hence take away after.Service was pretty slow but customers kept rolling in. Price wise it is cheaper if you go in a group.",

    "text": "Amidst the competitive Korean fried chicken scene in Singapore, FRESH chicken is no longer the key to success. Bring on the CHEESE, WHIPPED CREAM and the secret weapon--SWEET POTATO.I wonder if it is due to Singaporeans love for all things creamy and cheese because there are several items of the menu that contains either cheese or cream. One good example is the Nest Snow ($32.90), a bizarre yet wonderfully tasty mountain of Cajun chicken tenders served in a bubbling hot plate of Parmesan, mozzarella and cheddar. To top it all off, a swirl of whipped cream and sprinkles of cheese shavings. But Chir Chir (pronounced chee-ru chee-ru) does not stop at that. It had secretly ambushed a lump of mash SWEET POTATO beneath the chickens. There was no way one could escape from the intense cheesy-ness of this dish, but the presence of something sweet pulled your senses back into shape. If this was spiced with Chilli flakes, I think I'll be weeping at its culinary blasphemy.Crispy, Garlicky and Spicy. These are the three basic types of chicken that you can and should try at Chir Chir Fusion Chicken Factory, an authentic South Korean franchise that deep-fry the chicken wings, whole chicken or chicken tenders only UPON ORDER.  I can't complain about the freshness of the meat since it uses FRESH chicken and not FROZEN ones. Marinated with in-house seasoning for 6 hours, these are the type of chicken that you can eat a dozen in a sitting--perfectly crunchy, tasty and intoxicating. In fact, the original is my favourite amongst all dishes. Bite into the Spicy Wings ($28.90) and your tongue starts to sizzle a little before the sugar sweeps in and goes, \"Mmmmm....sweet!\" But the spice levels can still really pack \"a real punch\" for non-spicy eaters so their Garlicky Wings ($28.90) might be generally the safer choice as they delivered the results easily with a simple yet delicious soy sauce glaze. Yet what surprised me the most was the addition of roasted sweet potatoes and fried Toppoki that lent some balance to the textures and flavors. All the portions are incredibly filling and thus highly ideal for sharing. This is no exception for their Garlic Roasted Chicken--One WHOLE CHICKEN that is marinated for 12 hours before being oven-roasted to succulent perfection.  I loved the slightly charred black bits, which imbued a sexy smokiness not found in the fried chicken wings. But my wild guess is that I would love the Spicy BBQ Roasted more as the garlic sauce is rather gloopy and sweet. Plus I am biased towards anything spicy. The chicken is not their only selling point. The salads, or more precisely, fruit salads, are so sweet that they could pass off as desserts. The Honey Grape Salad ($18.90) is a unique combination of walnuts, pine nuts, almonds and fluffy dollops of home-made ricotta and whipped cream. When you tossed everything together and scooped some onto the crispy baked Tortilla that is laced with honey and minced garlic, all the different flavors and textures began to mingle in a mouthful delight. The secret to the deliciousness of this Mango Salad ($11.90) is because there is more than just the juicy sweet mango. There is something crunchy, something leafy and something tangy from the yoghurt dressing that makes this a vibrant plate full of perky flavors that would rejuvenate any jaded taste buds. What cannot be missed with fried chicken is a jar of solid good draught beer. Topped with lightly sweetened whipped cream, the Chir Cream Beer ($13.90 for 350ml / $18.90 for 650ml) is meant to inspire a re-enactment of a loving Korean drama scene in which the male partner helps to clean up the \"cream\" moustache on the girls' upper lips. Other signature tipples include the Tok! Tok! ($14.90non-alcoholic/$18.90 alcoholic per jug), a range of sweet cocktails that can be infused with soju for a boozy kick. I prefer the Passion Yellow \u00a0to the Blue Marine as the former is less sugary with a bright sour taste.Fear not about getting your hand phones dirty while you juggle between snapping photos and eating your chicken because Chir Chir has thoughtfully provided a special tongs that helps you shred the meat off the bones. But yes, you can still enjoy the wings with your fingers like me if you are struggling with the tools. Why not? It's still the best way to enjoy the finger-licking good chicken!",

Tip, you can ask for half half flavours so half your chicken can be original and another half, spicy or soy or garlic (whatever they offer). Which is great because I make it a point to try the original chicken all the time.How would I describe this? SINFUL. So delicious! So good!!!!! I'm salivating just thinking about it now haha. It's one of those meals that will make you feel fat afterwards but NO REGRETSSSS.Also, they have beer with whipped cream on it. In my opinion, just get the normal beer. Special shout out to the friendly staff member who made us laugh while serving us! Loved this place very much",

The honey butter fried chicken comes with honey butter fried tokppoki, which should really be its own dish, and potato wedges. It's sprinkled with cranberries and almonds flakes. Definitely delicious. It would be great if they had the whole fried chicken versionThe salads looked huge so we skipped it and got a small tokppoki and cheese. It was OK. The sauce was really mild and didn't taste cheesy. The rice cakes were nice and chewy. The salads looked really good though, so we'll get it next time.The drinks looked really exciting but we were not ready to be drinking on a Wednesday night. All in all, I'll be coming \u00a0back.

The quality would be justified if you slashed the price by quite a bit. That said, I'm not sure if there's better Korean chicken in Singapore so this could very well be the best you can get. Service was great!",

I KNOW good Korean Fried chicken!Until today that is, I came across Chir Chir which is an honest to God Korean franchise with over 100 Chain stores in Seoul. How does it taste? pasak pasak!(crispy)Soybean sauce drizzled fried chicken was just the right texture and a generous helpings. Mac and cheese was less so generous but still tasted creamy and great.Let's get back to the chicken...I'll be going back again.. This time for the spicy sauce...you like 4 fingers? You'll never eat it there again after you eat here.This place is doing a bustling business, get in and try!",

    "text": "We had two cokes and only one dish - \u00a0the Spicy Chicken for 2 pax. The wait for our food was too long though the restaurant was less than half filled. We nibbled on the two small side dishes of corn as we waited. They was mixed with a teeny bit of dressing but the taste was a little off, they didn't taste fresh. Luckily the fried chicken was much tastier - \u00a0sweet and spicy, with crunchy batter coating and thick slices of almond. We enjoyed it but I thought the spice and sweetness was a little intense after a few mouthfuls. If you like your food robust, you will like this. The bill for this plus two cans of coke came up to over $40, which we thought was too expensive for erm, fried chicken. There were some interesting things on the menu (beer topped with cream!) that I would like to try if I ever go back, that is when I crave for Korean fried chicken once in a blue moon.",
