They have more choices, and the rice (choice of brown or white) and miso soup - both with unlimited refills along with the cabbage - are several levels better! The different promotions are kind of rearrangements of the same stuff, not much savings.",

Inside is tender, outside is so crispy. I enjoyed their katsu! Comes with sesame seeds in mortar and pestle. So you can choose to grind it coarse or fine. It suppose to mix the sesame seeds with the Tonkatsu sauce. Casual place to enjoy lunch with affordable prices.",

    "text": "Maybe it was a Monday evening, maybe it was the end of the night but regardless, I just didn't get a good dining experience here. On the outside it is set up well. Tonkatsu, Kagoshima Black Pork. Tick. Roasted sesame. Tick. Free flow rice and cabbage. Tick some more. This looks like it could be very lovely..I decided I wanted it all and ordered the Hire & Rosu Katsu set, while my partner ordered the Hire Katsu Don. Anticipation. Especially since many reviews have said this was an institution. Maybe my expectations were too high. Or the Monday /end of the night reasoning again. The server brought out the plates and it went downhill from there. Rice was best described as soggy or mushy. Not eloquent at all but that's how I would describe it. The lettuce was on the side which was ok. Except when you've had it at other establishments in a lovely chilled separate bowl. The katsu was over breaded. The breading had a roughness to it which cut into the roof of my mouth. Orange slices, placed on our table before we had finished eating. Like I said, maybe it was a Monday evening, maybe it was the end of the day and everyone wanted to call it a night.Overall, not terribly exciting. I would suggest you look elsewhere. There are many options available and this is not one I'd recommend.",

Between the two of us, we had edamame, soft shell crab, tori karage, one oyster and one order of the pork katsu set,We finished every single last bite of our meal and I honestly could have done another pork loin katsu. The big winner here is obviously their specialty, the katsu. First, the Panko crust is completely even across the piece of meat. Secondly, you can't detect much oil and it barely leaves a mark. Lastly, the meat is juicy and tasty. Service was quick and though we did not have a reservation, they were quick to rearrange their reserved tables and seated us quickly. The food came out after a short wait. Looking forward to the next trip!",

    "text": "Flavouring aside, perhaps one has a greater desire for a tantalising texture in pursuit of attaining an exceptional meal experience. Any good piece of meat is capable of cropping up a challenging time, from the moment of selection, preparation to cooking. But all things cannot be achieved without a sophisticated rearing process in the case of swine production, especially when the legendary Iberian pig becomes the spotlight and well sought after by the culinary kitchen. If there are 2 things I should encode in my memory for 2012, it will be \"Tapas\" and \"Iberico pork\". The two are often spotted on the dance floor, if not seen on the stove top. Almost synonymous, they are nearly everywhere you see in the dining room. You probably have sank your teeth upteem times, tearing the meat effortlessly that follows by a lardy smooth melty sensation in the mouth with this prized meat - bathed in hot oil. While others had them at some popular Japanese eateries, I tried mine at Tonkichi - a Tonkatsu specialty chain - under the Pokka Food Corp.In the month of December, the breaded Iberico tenderloin makes it to the menu for the first time - Iberico Pork Hire/R\u014dsu Katsu Set. Priced at $32, I received 3 fillet cuts, each half the size of my palm. Given a choice of hire (tenderloin) and r\u014dsu (loin) cut, I often opt for the former as it came with lesser amount of fats and most delicate. In fact, the meat runs along the central spine of the pig, with the loin muscle making a larger part for locomotion and a much smaller segment merely for posture then becomes less fibrous - tenderloin, found near the end of this loin. Make your choice over hire or r\u014dsu, either part of this Iberian pig will serve alongside with some refillable shredded cabbage & rice, tsukemono (pickles), chawanmushi, miso and fruits.I fought hard to resist its buttery texture, these golden crisp fillets weren't floury. I am always amazed by the Japanese batter, so well formulated that it shatters every time. Aren't you tempted by the craggy exterior when confronted? I succumbed to this swine tyrant uncontrollably, too weak to defend. Although the crumbs can be edgy and caused some discomfort when met with parts of my soft oral linings, the moisture kept in the fillet under the crisp sheath soothed the pricks I had. What makes it marvellous was the less greasy and ultra-tender composition. This acorn-fed Spanish black pork is definitely worth trying. The additional 10bucks is the price to pay for the premium specimen, 50% for that regular hire katsu set going for $20.90. Be sure to dabble the meat in Worcestershire sauce, better yet, coat them in the powdered sesame seeds you crushed earlier on. The caramelised condiment adds a fruity punch to the meat. Unless you wanted more heat, the yellow karashi (Japanese mustard-paste) will be helpful. For simplicity, squeeze the lemon wedge for that extra zest and to fuse any additional oily secretion - if any - but wasn't present in my case.I guess the meat is the only item I have greatly enjoyed, other than the good mannered service and a timber wood layout. Although I questioned on the quality of the rice which was mushy, the worst being the fruits - watermelon - all time syrupy in its unnatural form.",

    "text": "The first time I had Tonkichi, I thought it was excellent. The tonkatsu was crispy and flavourful and I thoroughly enjoyed grinding my own sesame seeds to make the sauce for my tonkatsu. Subsequently, I started to dread going there. I still enjoy 'making' my own sauce and in fact, that is one of the reasons why I always order the tonkatsu set instead of my favourite Japanese dish, katsudon. What I wasn't so hot for was the crumbs with which they coat and fry the pork. While it was indeed crispy, it also felt like an assault on my gums. After the meal was over, my gums would feel more raw than they had ever been and my mouth would actually be tired of chewing. The coating of crumbs was rough and hard enough to constantly rub against my gums while chewing and the meat was a little tough as well. Perhaps my jaw is too weak and my gums too delicate, but for that reason, I tend to avoid eating there nowadays especially if it's going to cost me $30 for a meal that causes me pain. It is nevertheless a delicious meal with free flow of shredded lettuce and a decent houji cha for those who are not looking to eat the tonkatsu.",
