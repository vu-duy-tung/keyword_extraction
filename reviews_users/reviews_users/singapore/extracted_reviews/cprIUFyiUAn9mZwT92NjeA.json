    "text": "The secret is out. This is my favorite prawn noodle place and for it to be near my place is even better. The only drawback is getting there if you drive. There is very limited parking available and you may be better off parking in the residential area nearby. Or take the bus, the bus stop is right in front of the restaurant. I will only drive here in the non-peak afternoon period. Otherwise it is the bus for me even though it is only a couple of stops away. The heat of Singapore makes one wilt, so no walking under the hot sun. The soup has been consistently umami with a rich prawny taste. However I thought the soup lacked the customary flavor on my last visit. I hope it is a one-off thing as I would hate to think the standard has drop. The small portion is quite tiny with just 4 prawn halves for $4. Maybe it is time to get the bigger portion now. I like the ngoh hiang. The prawn fritter was so crispy and fresh. The dipping sauce was excellent too. I wished there was more of it though I think they would refill it if you ask. This place has been around for many years now and it has a friendly family feel to it. On my last visit, a domestic help came back with her takeaway order and told the staff her employer wanted just prawn noodles, not prawn with pork noodles. The staff was very kind and did not berate the help about the miscommunication in ordering (different languages after all) and instead told the help how to order it in future. And they cheerfully changed the order for her. I thought that was very kind of the restaurant people.",

For that matter it's my favorite Prawn Noodle restaurant in the world.They serve Prawn Mee, Pork Rib Mee, and Pig's Tail Mee, and every combination of the three. You can have it wet or dry, with yellow noodles, bee hoon, or kway teow (or mixed). The prawns are big and fresh, the broth is rich and flavorful and the chili is excellent.I usually get the prawn and ribs, sometimes wet, sometimes dry. I always get the yellow noodles, because it is extremely difficult to find good yellow noodles in the States.While waiting have some excellent Ngo Hiang, and then finish your meal with some lime ice jelly.I have been here on weekends and evenings and have always been able to get a table. The people are friendly, the place is clean, and the prices are reasonable.",

Mostly veery busy for lunch.I was asked if it was spicy? There is fresh cut chili on the table along with other local condiments so it is as hot or spicy as you like to make it. You can see I've already loaded mine up in the photo. There is also folded paper bowls (like origami) made out of old magazine paper for the bones and prawn shells. Old school and recycle!",

    "text": "Absolutely love the prawn mee here. Not because it's so convenient from my workplace but it's just different (good different of course) from many prawn mees out there. The stall looks pretty Chinese vintage with cushioned chairs and round stools. Don't worry about the hot weather as the fans are pretty effective.Lunch crowd can be a headache that's why it would be good if you come by around 3+ or 5+pm. Do note that they close early at 8.30pm!!I always order dry prawn beehoon+mee with chili. It's being served with a bowl of really awesome soup that is refillable (self service! Just walk to the kitchen). Food comes really quick even during peak hours! As a side snack, you can also get some ngo hiang which will come with this super delicious dipping sauce! I brought a few friends here and they all loved it!",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of prawn noodles, and when I read the rave reviews about this place, I knew that I just had to give it a try.I usually like to eat my prawn noodles in the dry mode, so that I could taste both the gravy in the dry noodles and the prawn based soup that the stall has to offer. The best of both worlds, as they say. And the best of both worlds indeed, as both the noodles and the soup were equally satisfying.I ordered the version with both prawns and pork ribs. The prawns were very fresh, but the ribs were no slouch either; the meat was very tender and slid off the bone very easily. The component that really helps the prawn noodles here hit the home run is no doubt the fried chili. When you mix it with the noodles (with just the right quantity), the combination is really lethal. Writing about this actually makes me want to go back and eat it right now.",
