    "text": "'Let's go to Book Cafe today! Awww yeah I missed that place!\" It's such a cozy hang out, perfect to chill on the couch and catch up on some emails, maybe even do a little bit of work. During the weekends it can be quite packed, but nobody seems to mind sharing a couch. You gotta accept a bit of PDA though, the crowd is a combination of couple's snuggling up to each other and having brunch or a coffee together, and the other half is couples composed of a person dating a laptop.Easy going vibes with Jack Johson and Enya are playing on the background and dim \u00a0lights. The services matches the music and is slow as well. Menu is quiet extensive and there's always something that can satisfy your needs. 15 dollar for a salad and 8 dollars for a iced mocha is a bit much though, but you are paying for the ambiance and for one of limited spots on the couches.",

Have tried the pancakes and the fry up which consisted of hash brown, sausages, bacon, toast and eggs for brunch, cod and sandwiches for dinner, and last but not least, hot cocoa with marshmallows, mango smoothies and a variety of desserts i.e, apple pie, lemon and rosemary cake with Greek yogurt as well as pine nut pie (available only on weekends).

As the cafe's name eludes to, there is a very large inventory of reading material for one's perusal. Free and fast WiFi (perhaps I visited when patrons weren't streaming). Order cheese cake slices and a flat white. Cheese cakes had a gummy texture to the surface layer, so maybe it wasn't as fresh as I expected. The flat white was very good. Double shot from some nice dark roasted beans and some milk ... nice cup of Joe to my liking! Average cafe with an extra star for stacks of reading material, less a star for mediocre cheese cakes.",

At one side of the restaurant, there are couches that were perfect for relaxing with a good book. And books there were aplenty for you to browse with. The service staff were friendly and eager to please. Unfortunately, the food though decent, isn't good enough for me to specially return for it. I had the eggs blackstone (English muffin, spinach, tomatoes, eggs, rosti) and a flat white. The coffee was better than I expected - low in acidity. I was excited about the apple pie based on previous reviews, but it didn't live up to the hype. I prefer a harder crust; the filling had just the right hint of tartness and sweetness. My friend really enjoyed his chicken sandwich which he ordered based on the recommendation of another reviewer. It's a nice place to hang out with friends but if you're a picky eater, it may not live up to your expectations. Free wifi available. Toilet is very clean and orderly.",

    "text": "I'll admit I'm biased because I love anything book related.Let me try to be objective though.Came in on a Sunday for brunch (today, actually)Had smoked salmon set sans the salmon, because vegetarian. Flat white. Long black. My friend had the smoked salmon set and vouched for the edibility of the salmon, hot cocoa, and we shared a French toast set. Food was great, waiting time was Long, even though the place was not crowded. Worth the wait though. Price is average for cafes. Decent portion size.Music is old fashioned jazz-ish music. Not loud enough for me, but then again, to each their own. Service was great. Attentive, friendly, non-judgy even though my half-asleep brain asked weird questions about the menu. Bright enough for study/work/reading. They also have a great selection of books to read. If you're so inclined, it's a great place to transition from coffee to wine/beer. All in all, an experience I wouldn't mind repeating the next time I have an itch to be outside on a Sunday.",

Throw in free fast-speed Wi-Fi, more than 10 socket plugs peppered around the place and dozens of foreign/local magazines for your reading pleasure and you have a caf\u00e9 that is perpetually teeming with diners/readers every day of the week.Take your pick between square tables or lounge sofa seats, put up your feeds and chill-out for a few hours reading, gossiping, sipping a cuppa or whiling the time away people-watching.My fourth visit to the caf\u00e9 saw me ordering their Traditional Apple Pie which did not disappoint at all; think soft, chewy, sweet apple bits hidden expertly within a thin, crispy, sugary crust with streaks of chocolate sauce on the side. I didn't order drinks this time as I came on a full stomach but on my previous visits, their Flat White left quite a good impression on me too.Packed with weekenders in casual wear during weekends and with businessmen on weekdays, The Book Caf\u00e9 comes highly recommended if you're in the Havelock Road area and looking for a good place to recharge (self and electronics alike).",

All I can say is that it's reputation certainly lives up to its name with large bookshelves inside covered in books, as well as a number of covers of Lolita on one of the walls. I came here for breakfast (I simply wasn't interested in breakfast at my hotel, even though it was probably included in the price) and I must admit that it was pretty good, and the coffee wasn't all that bad either. This is one of those places that I could easily spend a few hours in every morning with a hot cup of tea and a nice book. The also have an outdoor section, though a part of that is a smoking area, though why would one want to sit outside when you can sit inside with all the marvellous books.",

I've come to The Book Cafe several times before and most of the times in the past, it has been relatively crowded. \u00a0However, tonight, on a Wednesday evening at about 6:45pm, it is relatively quiet. \u00a0In fact, a lot of the sofas are still unoccupied. But that's probably about to change as some people come here for dinner, dessert, or drinks. This is the kind of cafe to come, relax and chill for awhile. \u00a0Half of the cafe space is simply an enclave of comfy sofas and shelves of magazines and books. \u00a0This is the kind of place you expect to spend at least an hour or two, or three...The prices are mid-range but that is to be expected, given the location. \u00a0It's walking distance from Robertson Quay, with its fancy restaurants and bars. \u00a0The Book Cafe offers a nice ambience for personal time; and even if you come with someone, you are able to each do your own thing while sitting comfortably side-by-side. This is on the short list of \"must-visit\" cafes in Singapore.",

They have the coziest sofa but when you sat for too long, believe me it was tiring as the table is too low. Hence we wish to change seats since there are plenty of tables outdoor. The PIC told us we shouldn't do that and seek for our understanding. My husband suggested to the waitress that we paid for the bills and we change table. But they insisted us to remain the seats,and once again hope us to understand. We were quite pissed off since plenty of tables still vacant..we decided to leave and will never return to this cafe again. Advice from us..if you all wish to visit this cafe please find a comfortable place or else you will not be able to change table again",

They serve breakfast, salads, sandwiches, and entrees catered to the cafe crowd. They also have a lengthy tea and coffee selection. I came here for breakfast 3 days straight, and it's very satisfying. Food is well-seasoned and portions are appropriate. AMBIANCE: I like it because they don't try to hard. The place embodies the calming neighborhood vibe. There's a section with couches if you want to wind down for you drink/eat, and an outdoor seating area as well. I stayed for a couple hours on Sunday to work, and they were very accommodating. PRICE: Very reasonable all things considered. You can get a proper breakfast/meal + coffee for right around $20. OVERALL: Highly recommend this place to anyone living in the Robertson Quay area. Singapore in general could use a few more of these neighborhood joints. PS: +0.5 stars for doing takeaway",

They play some nice 50-60's old swing Motown blues, real soothing and conducive to the relaxing atmosphere.You could sit outside or inside, where I bet it's perfect to post up and do some work from home stuff. They a little living room library set up just next to the main dining area.Off the shelves are tons of magazines and periodicals for you to peruse during your stay. They even have my favorite, Monocle!As for food, I could only comment on breakfast as that's all I've had here the past two times. A set will set you back S$14 and that's your standard two eggs, some toast, hash browns and a meat of choice. Add in a coffee and you are looking at a little under S$20 all in.The service is very good at this place, real friendly and and attentive, but not overly.This place makes me want to come back and do some work. I may do that so i could test out the lunch specials.This will be one of my frequent neighborhood haunts!",
