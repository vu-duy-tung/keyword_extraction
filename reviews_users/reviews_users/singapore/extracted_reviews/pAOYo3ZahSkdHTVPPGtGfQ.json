I like how it's hidden from everything else, like a little sanctuary.Brunch sets and coffee here are average but the laid back atmosphere makes up for it. Salads and juices are great, the first time I visited Kith, I wanted something more than what was offer on the blackboard so I asked if I could request for a specific salad. I was in luck because the person who would soon say yes was none other than lady boss Jane herself.So I had a ginger grilled chicken salad with baby spinach, wild rocket, japanese cucumber and cherry tomatoes, and have had it again every time I return. It tastes awesome.Perfect for a lazy weekend.",

Go for their breakfast which is served with the best toast in Singapore and home-made strawberry jam. Their coffee is pretty great too. Try the Kith macchiato, which is espresso, chocolate, topped with a marshmallow. They recently expanded to a bigger space, in the same location. Have lunch outdoors facing the Singapore River.

I saw Kith and recalled that I had been at their other location by Dhoby Ghaut and did not find it horrible so I was up for giving it a shot (and to be honest at this point I would probably even have given McDonalds a chance). Kith has a pretty relaxed setting at a corner of a house with some shade but it does not really have any seats inside so even if it is shaded it is still fairly warm.I had some pretty decent pasta with a pretty good flat white while S went for a toastie and a freshly pressed juice. Neither of these were anything special but more what one can expect and prices are a bit higher than I would like to pay but then it is Robertson Quay after all so perhaps to be expected. I have since been a few more times and they are in a sense reliable, there has so far never been anything amazing nor anything really disappointing. It can tend to get a bit too noisy around as many families with children appear to like to come here and at least when I have been there it has been the type of people who do not feel like telling their kids to behave and take it easy so if that disturbs you it may not be the best place.",

I must say that it wasn't really the best place that I had visited here in Singapore, but then again you can't always expect to strike it lucky when exploring a new city. Okay, I do have to say that the staff were pretty good, but when I looked at the menu there really wasn't anything all that appealing. The place was pretty small, so all of the seats were outside, and while their coffee was okay, it wasn't the best. Mind you, the locals seem to quite like the place since there were always people gathering around here (usually mums with their strollers).

Eggs, bacon and some wheat toast. They also had fresh juice, I had the watermelon. For lack of a better word, it was homey. Just what I was looking for. It wasn't anything extraordinary but the cafe gave me enough to want to come back and try out the specials. It looks like people were very keen on the Kith Coffee, so I need to come back and get that. I love the neighborhoody feel and the friendly service.

What I like about Kith is that it's kinda cute and quirky, it's always sincere and honest..and that reflects in the coffee, food and service.It operates out of a tiny space but they expand quite a bit outside. The tables and chairs are built for small people (luckily I'm one) but many tall expatriates seem to squeeze in comfortably (kid in tow). I personally think the old location was prettier inside..more seating but the new location is less food-fumey and has more shade so I think overall it's better.The food is simple and straightforward but there are little touches of brilliance. Love their white bread in the big brek always nicely toasted and love the homely strawberry jam - it really looks like someone spent all day cooking it on the hearth.Free wifi - always a nice bonus.Prices for the big brek and coffee are attractive. I've had the toastie several times for a lighter bite and it's very simple but it's served nice and hot with a tart apple salad on the side.The coffee is not the best but it's usually a nice to good cup..at $3.80 it's worth it. If you get a cup that's over-extracted and bitter, give your feedback to the staff. I think they will hasten to replace it.",

So when I need some down-time to myself on the weekend, i'd head down here with a good book for a cup of latte and sandwiches. If the weather is nice you can people-watch by the river while enjoying your meal too! Love!On to the food - I usually get one of their sandwiches. It's easy no frills sandwich and cheap for what it is - they're priced at $8,$10 and $15. My favorite is the smoked salmon one for $10.I've had their big breakfast too and it's relatively cheap for about $15-16. It's a proper breakfast. Their mini toasties are good for if you don't feel like having any of the above but still want something to nibble on.Coffee is excellent.The only down side is, seating is mostly outdoors and there are no A/C, which can be downright unbearable when it's especially hot in Singapore",

    "text": "Who love Mondays? Well I do 'cos I'm having lunch at kith's cafe. A little Monday pick-me-up lunch of Spaghetti Meatballs and Flat White makes my Monday that much sweeter. My first time here, I was abit disappointed that the place was a bit small (no seating inside) but managed to get a seat outside, facing the river. However, since it was a Monday, there wasn't much crowd save for the odd Caucasian couple with kids, Caucasian yuppies and a few passer-bys getting some takeaway coffee. The view was good - luckily the sky was overcast and the weather was cool; I can't imagine what it would be like if it is a hot sunny day! \u00a0Food was ok but coffee gets my nod of approval! I drank one cup and got another one to take back to the office. Will definitely drop by again - but not on weekends!",

    "text": "The interior is very small- a couple of bar seats, and a long bench for a large group. Furnishing is pretty spartan, the legs of the bar and chairs reminds me of book stacks. Feels pretty much like an old classroom with the blackboard as well. The 'alfresco dining' is in fact a couple of tables and chairs/stools scattered along the corridor. Fits very much into the home and patio concept. I can see how the residents are drawn to this little spot.Breakfast food is a must have (if i have my way that is). I would also insist on all day breakfast too. We were there for tea so we didn't try the food.Kith's scone looks pretty but tastes crappy and it got worse as the temperature dropped. The texture is almost cardboard-ish and dry. It was only a little better with the.. wait for it... WHIPPED cream (oh how i hate it when they serve whipped instead of clotted). The jam was kinda weird with the watery texture. It looks like it was curdled and then defrosted. Anyway, just avoid the scone at all cost.Drinks are good though.",

    "text": "A good advantage of staying relative near town is the accessibility to all these little cafes that are sprucing up in town. Kith Cafe has become one of my usual brunch places on the weekends to grab a quick bite with \"free\" parking. My typical brunch there would be their hotdog and a glass of \u00a0lychee watermelon iced blended. Kith Cafe is very popular with expat families and increasingly popular with the locals too. \u00a0Great place for informal group gathering and even playdates for the kids. It can be quite chaos \u00a0on weekends with kids and pets around. \u00a0Well, its one of the very few cafes that is both kids and pets friendly. Recently, my husband and I brought my 8 months old baby girl along to have brunch. She loves to sit and watch the older kids play. I think she must be wishing that she is old enough to join in the fun. Great place to people watch by the river too!",

The view... well by the canal (wouldn't really call it a river tho it connects to the Singapore River)Coffee was decent, but the toastie I had was terrible. I ordered a egg and ham toastie. it was very homemade style, which wasn't quite what i was looking for. Worst part of the toastie was that the scrambled eggs inside was definitely cooked eons ago and was too dry. more like a scrambled egg bits.Kitchen looked make-shift, small and dirty.",

The bread wasn't great, but the jam appeared to be homemade and was quite good although they don't really give you enough of it to cover the giant pieces of bread. On this weekend, the place looked like an expat daycare center because of all the toddlers running around--that could be a positive or negative depending on your point of view but just be aware. Plenty of seating outside though and a nice place to have a cup of joe.",

On weekends, Kith is generally crowded unless you come a little later in the afternoon. I usually order an unsweetened iced coffee and a cheese and bacon toastie (I love the little apple slices they provide on the side to temper the savouriness of the toastie with crunchy sweetness). Sitting outside along the sidewalk with a newspaper and coffee at hand is a great way to spend a peaceful Sunday.",

    "text": "We walked with our dog close to three miles from Tangling Mall along Orchard road, through Ft. Canning park, down to Clarke Quay and finally Robertson Quay. Having the dog with us limited the places we could eat at but then we found Kith. They were happy to let us sit outside with him, even providing water for him. We ordered the smoked salmon sandwich and the steak sandwich. We also ordered the pineapple and ginger drinks. The service was prompt and friendly. The drinks were cold and refreshing, never having tasted pineapple and ginger before. The sandwiches were very tasty, the steak getting the slight edge over the smoked salmon. The side order of bacon for the dog was tasty enough that a couple of pieces did not make it to the intended customer. All in all it was a good experience, we will be back.",
