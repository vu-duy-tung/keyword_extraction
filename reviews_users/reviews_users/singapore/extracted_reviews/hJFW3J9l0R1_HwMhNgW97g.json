    "text": "Walking around trying to think of what to eat for dinner, my husband pointed to this tiny shop. I was beyond tired and agreed. So we line up, I order our food and wanted to find in, alas all the seats were taken and no one seemed to care that we had a 3year old in tow who needed to be fed. We too our food to go but couldn't find anywhere around Paragon that would be suitable to sit and eat a take away meal. As we wondered around we made our way back to Tori-Q and woohoo, there was a spare spot. So we squished in, my 6'4\" husband, daughter and I. I was adamant that our meal would by now be lacklustre due to being carted around, but I was wrong. Everything was tasty, I particular the chicken balls. My husband had to go back for a second round of those!So food - awesome; service - great; ambiance - poor. But still gets 4 stars!",

I do think their serving sizes could be a bit larger for their chicken box offerings, and the ladies taking your order shedding a smile wouldn't hurt.The chicken meatballs are probably the best aspect of the meal. Overall, satisfying, but nothing I'd generally crave or go out of my way for.",

I managed to try three different types of chicken: chicken, chicken balls, pork with asparagus. The cost was not too expensive and if you love yakatori, then they dip the chicken skewers in the sauce before serving to you.",

For a quick bite in between hop by Tori-Q and enjoy the flavor!Be it either the Tsukune (which is widely known as chicken balls in the decent version) or even the full Yakitori you will not be disappointed.The items here are well priced and I never had a bad dish. I would recommend though you stick to the chicken dishes as those tend to be better in my opinion. I had a couple pork varieties and barely got them off the skewer.Enjoy! Num num...-s :)",

    "text": "Tori-Q is great for a quick bite when one has neither the time nor effort to sit down for a full yakitori meal. I love the tsukune (chicken meatballs) and the chicken ... the kawa (chicken skin) is amazingly crisp ... I used to wonder who would buy chicken skin until I tried it ... and I was sold! The ebi is not bad as well ... the pork is a tad on the tough side so I generally prefer the chicken options. The sauce has gotten a bit too sweet for me so I usually opt to have my yakitori without. If you are feeling really hungry, opt for the bento box option with rice, it's a pretty good deal!Service is generally friendly and efficient.",

    "text": "If you're in Paragon and looking for a budget bite, Tori-Q is your answer. Basically Tori-Q offers \"lunch boxes\" comprising of steamed Japanese rice, 4 yakitori sticks and a side of pickles. Favorites include, bacon wrapped asparagus and chicken with green peppers. These yakitori sticks are made freshly throughout the day which you can observe through their class kitchen at every outlet. More of a take-away place than a sit in. Think of it as Japanese fast food if you will!",
