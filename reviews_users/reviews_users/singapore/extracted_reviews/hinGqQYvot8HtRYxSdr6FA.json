Complaints range from exorbitant prices for seafood to mediocre food quality.I do like some of the stalls there though - the carrot cake is good and fish soup is also reputedly good. Also, I had seafood (I just picked some random stall) and it was quite good, though yes, it was expensive. What can get annoying about this place are the \"touts\" that keep bugging you to order from their stall. So, while I don't have a specific stall to recommend, and it is not my favourite hawker centre, I'd suggest heading down if you're in the area and feel like local fare. It's really not that bad , and not that expensive. As for which stall to choose, I'd recommend the standard method of looking for a queue ... shouldn't be far off decent food then!",

Of course it's not cheap, of course the locals go to other places less popular with foreigners. But those are impossible to find if you're not accompanied by a local and not everybody from abroad will like it there. So, Newton Food Center has it all, a wide choice of tasty quality food, most typical local dishes and a nice atmosphere. I recommend particularly the Goodman BBQ seafood grill (see picture). Try the spicy squid or the BBQ stingray! And of course: tiger beer :-)))",

The prawn noodles owner will only open after 7.45pm on most days and if you come here earlier than that the store will be closed. I'm not sure what time they open for lunch.

    "text": "My dining experience here was not pleasant at all. It was late at night, and I was tired and hungry, and using what was left of my energy to explain the different hawker foods to a friend from overseas that I was showing around. I did not appreciate the hawkers bugging us at all. They came at us at first warmly, insisting on showing us which table to sit at, then kept shoving the menu at us insisting we order something. When we said we wanted to look around first so that I could show him the different foods, they would insist that all the food around is the same so I might as well get it from them. This happened at every seafood stall of which there was one every two stalls or so. It got so bad that we walked around from afar and would only approach a stall if it did not say seafood.And then, there's the price. It is probably about 20% to 50% more than what the food would usually cost in an average hawker centre. A plate of duck rice or fish porridge would probably be $4 and drinks were $2.50 to $3. I didn't think the duck rice was very good to be honest and had far too much sauce on it and not enough duck. The fish porridge was quite decent, and the popiah was rather bland. If you desperately need a place to eat like we did, then I suppose this is not too bad an option but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all.",

Yes I know that Newton is terribly touristy and can be a bit overpriced - but in terms of location though, it's hard to beat it. Maxwell is much quieter at night, and Chomp Chomp is just too far away. Seafood at Newton can be expensive if you're not careful about what you order - but there are some gems in the centre. Try looking for the famous carrot cake shop - it's the one with the super long queue (yeah, exactly the best descriptor I know). Other must tries include a really yummy Hokkien Mee (again, not sure where it is exactly, but the store does have a few newspaper cuttings in front of it). It's",

Paired with sugar cane water that was sold from the stall next door, it was a pretty decent meal. Locals may complain about the price, but coming from NYC I found it to be easy on the wallet. The vendors approaching us constantly (even when we already had our food ordered) was a minor inconvenience, but again, NYC has trained me well in ignoring people so I didn't mind it too much. Just politely decline and they'll leave you alone. Trust me, it could be A LOT worse- at least they don't repeatedly bother you after you've said \"no\" once.Overall, not a bad place to visit, good to say you've been once.",

You will inevitably be spoilt for choice as you (attempt to) peruse the neon signboard menus, and try to fend off laminated menu wielding waiters.

Chances are, you'll like what you get, and will want to return for more. \u00a0Just be wary of sneaky seafood stalls that try to oversell or overcharge for their goods!

Without exception all were very very good.Ms Tan herself is one in a million. Every time a dish arrives she will say\" yummy yummy in your tummy\". It never fails to bring a smile.",

    "text": "This is a good place to go if you want seafood (think chilli crab, grilled stingray and cereal prawns) in a less formal environment than say Jumbo Seafood. I lost count but there must be 10 seafood stalls here!! So grab some seafood and a fruit drink and who cares if people label you as a tourist?Prices aren't cheap for Asia but still cheaper than for those from Australia etcThere are plenty of tables and if you go outside of peak times, it shouldn't be too much of an issue finding a seat.Newton Circus is only a short walk from the Newton MRT station. TIP no need to walk over the pedestrian bridge, go further along and cross at the traffic light leading into the carpark.",

My wife on the other hand was tricked by a vendor standing outside one of the restaurants to order, prawns, stingray, noodles, rice and fish. When I asked her how much the bill was, she was uncertain. We asked the vendor, and he tells us, not to worry that it's cheap and we get a lot of food at a great deal. At the end of eating her meal, the guy who tricked my wife, tells us the bill is $130 Singapore dollars!! Say What??? I didn't have that much Singapore dollars on me and only had a $100 US dollar bill \u00a0which the vendor gladly took to compensate for the Singapore dollars. Tourists, please be careful when coming here! The food is good, but avoid the vendors that come up to you to try to get you to go to their restaurant. Do it on your own. Plenty of places to choose from and not as expensive! Three stars for the food. Loss of two stars for the tricky vendors praying upon tourists.",

Disclaimer: We did go on Vesak day and some stalls were closed.We went with a mee goreng, a lemon chicken (seemed pricey at $15?), and an oyster sauce green vege dish. Had the bean curd for dessert. Everything was just average I thought. The lemon chicken probably the best dish but I should hope so at $15 in a hawker centre! I would have liked to have seen some more noodle and rice options...maybe I hadn't done my research well enough? Because I know this place gets good kudos. It was the hard sell from the stall owners that really put me off though.Meh, won't be back.",

We ordered jumbo prawns, vegetables and other local favs from Sin Sin Seafood BQ (stall 66) and were very pleased. The shrimp are massive and nicely broiled, without all the yucky chili oil that is lathered on at many restaurants. You can also find lobster, chicken skewers and pretty much anything else you'd like. Service was great - the lady from the beer stall kept stopping by whenever we were needed a new bottle. And the price can't be beat. Overall a great experience, though I subtract 1* for the somewhat annoying hawkers/touts. Yes, I know that's what they get paid to do, but that doesn't make it any less irritating to be hassled as you walk by every single store. Easy to find off the Newton MRT stop.",

    "text": "I visited Newton Hawker Center on 26th Feb and at 730pm, the car park was almost full and the parking attendant was making his rounds and issuing parking fines! Do note, they do not have a gantry system, so have your parking coupons ready!There are a lot of BBQ Seafood stalls in Newton and most of them sell the same stuff. Do note that though they tout and push each shop, every customer has the right to say NO! The touters get commission based on what they sell to you. To avoid getting cheated, pay upon ordering and INSIST so, else you might end up with a 3 digit bill at the end of your meal, with no explanation.Here's a review of the food we shared amongst 6 people, 4 of which were yelpers :)The Ocean BBQ \u00a0#01-016 We just picked the stall we sat right next too, but I did notice that the stalls facing the inner circle seemed to be more popular. This ocean BBQ, is one of the outside stalls facing the car park.1. Lemon Chicken $15I loved lemon chicken and we ordered this. Expecting to be a thick chicken cutlet, I was surprised to see it served as fried cubed chicken. Some pieces were of the thigh meat, hence more flavourful, some pieces were breast meat and very dry. The sauce itself was decent, very lemony and you can taste the slight blend of honey. But I guess having cubed-sized chicken makes it easier for sharing.2. Sambal Singray $15Jie Ying mentioned that the sambal was nice and it was! It was slightly sweet and for someone like me who doesn't eat spicy. This was the perfect sambal stingray for me! The stingray was meaty and the meat was easily separated from the bones. 3. Sambal SotongA similar sauce from the stingray was stir fried with the sotong, hence making the sotong abit sweet. The sotong tasted fresh and the serving was big enough for the 6 of us to share. Chances is, I might hit this stall up again, the next time I'm here. Definitely in love with their sambal!Bedok 85 Fried Oyster #01-0401. Oyster Omelette $5They were very generous with the oysters, The egg was crispy on the top layer, but on the bottom layer, it was soggy and was very mushy. I didn't quite like it in the end. If you want really good oyster omelette, try Kim Keat at Bradell.2. Carrot Cake White/black $4Even though their sign boards still says the carrot cakes are sold in $3 portions, They have increased their prices. The black had alot more egg and was sweet. The white wasn't crispy and tasted bland. Overall, another upsetting local dishKwang Huat #01-015 Steffenie was patiently waiting for this stall to open at 745pm! And at 730pm the owners were ready to take orders, but we didn't get our food till about 750pm.1. Hokkien Prawn Mee $5For $5, you get a satisfying plate of prawn mee with a lot of gravy, and 4 big prawns. The gravy is truly tasty and yummy. Although you can tell they did not use any lard, so it's missing that special taste. Some sotong and egg is what you get with the prawn mee, no three-layer pork meat either. I guess this stall is now muslim-friendly. 2. Char Kway Teow This was a rather OK dish at best. I couldn't taste the wok-hei and there were a lot of cockles and no other ingredients, there were like 2 slices of 50 cent coin sized fish cakes.. I do not like cockles, so I found this very upsetting. Char Kway teow to me is my most favourite dish in Singapore but I wouldn't come back here for this.Singa Cafe #01-014 Their sugar juice drinks are $1.50 and can drinks are priced at $1.50. Very reasonable pricingSoursop Juice $2I loved that their soursop juice was full of soursup meat. The drink was served with a plastic spoon, which you will need to scoop up the fruit.For those unknown to the benefits of soursop.Soursop contains a number of natural substances that have biological benefits such as, relieve stomach distress, fever, pain and respiratory problems such as cough and asthma.TKR #01-030 After walking around, we realized the prices were standard for the chicken wings $1.30 and 60cents per satay. We decided to go with TKR as it was a chinese stall, which meant they sold pork satay!1. Pork/chicken/mutton Satay 60 cents eachWe ordered 10 sticks of pork, 10 sticks of chicken and 10 sticks of mutton which added up to $18, and they gave us 5 bowls of satay sauce. The pork satay had alot of fats in them, which for me, I actually enjoyed. For the health conscious, you might want to just take the chicken sticks, which were more tender. The mutton was considerably drier than the chicken and pork, but it didn't have the weird smell. So I was okay with it.2. BBQ Chicken wings $1.30 eachThe chicken wings were pretty good. I enjoyed the crispy roasted skin. The meat was very juicy and I felt that for BBQ chicken wings, these weren't too oily and is a good choice for me! I've had BBQ chicken wings dripping with oil and that's usually the reason why I avoid them.They were presented very nicely on the styrofoam plate. They definitely gave some thought into present",

    "text": "There are just too many good food centers in Singapore, with top notch hawkers dishing out food you will always go back for, despite a long line. With such competition around, Newton Circus is just one of many and has the misfortune to be seen as a tourist trap. It did not help that there used to be touts (maybe there still are?) from the seafood stalls (usually) targeting and annoying the diners who may just want to browse first before deciding on what to order. The only good thing about Newton Circus is that it is opened till very late at night and used to be my one of my \"go to\" places for supper after clubbing. I never knew it is also open in the day time until a few years ago. I think day time stalls cater more to the people working or studying in the area, as well as those heading to Malaysia. There is a causeway link bus leaving from the car park which takes people across to JB. So in the wee hours of the morning, at least one stall will be open (the bak chor mee stall facing the car park is open 24 hours) to serve customers who need sustenance before their trip to Malaysia or heading to work. By 8 am, more stalls will be open (mostly those facing the car park) - bak chor mee stall, Malay stall and a few drinks stall. From 11 am, the stalls on the row facing the car park will all be open, plus a few other stalls facing the inner court yard area, to cater to the lunch crowd. The seafood and bbq chicken wings stalls are mostly open in the evening. The stalls I usually frequent:Fish soup: all the 3 stalls are good with fresh fish. - stall facing car park, next to Thai stall -- very fresh fish slices but cost much more than the others. Also serve tang hoon fish ball soup.- stall facing car park, towards the end near Malay stall -- better for fried fish soup with milk- stall behind of the row facing car park, next to Indian drinks stall -- also food for fresh fish slice soup with no milk. Duck stall (yu kee I think) facing car park -- one my of favorite place for duck porridge (only $3 which is cheap for Newton pricing) and duck kway teow or set. The soup is herbal and the stallholder is very generous about giving refills. The chili is fantastic with fried crispy ikan bilis in it. For the Malay stalls, I prefer the corner one nearer to the bus stop along Bukit Timah road. It has one of the cheapest nasi padang around. The corner Malay stall facing the car park is pricier and generally attracts more customers because of the location. The sardine curry puff and fried chicken wing are good though. The popiah stall facing the car park is Hokkien style and is something of an acquired preference. I only like it after trying it a few times. You need to order a minimum of 2 rolls and is open a bit later in the day, after 1230 pm or so. The Thai stall is open closer to 12 pm and is very popular. You will need to wait for a while. It has pretty good Thai food like the usual pad thai, basil chicken rice, etc. The tom yam soup is not that nice though. The nasi lemak stall near the Thai food is fairly new and is overpriced and not that good. For a small plate of fried beehoon with a tiny piece of luncheon meat, it cost $3. The chili is of the Maggi variety. The highly recommended fried chicken is also not worth it. Just normal. Fruit juice and fresh fruits are better at the stall facing the car park. Pricing is ok too, when compared to Orchard area. Hot and Cold Dessert stall facing the car park is another hot favorite for many. Pricing is also of the affordable type, cheaper than food court in the malls. In general, I think the stalls which are opened during the day has reasonable hawker pricing and you will not think they are overpriced at all. I think the bad rep for Newton Circus hawkers about over-charging is usually referred to the seafood BBQ stalls or those stalls which are open at night.",

Someone's there to \u00a0take your order, bring your food, clean up after you eat. I guess you can go up to the individual shacks and order, but why go through all that trouble. Cereal Prawns?Check. Chili Crab? Check. Crispy whole fish?Please!Fried rice?OMG yes.Lemon Chicken?Bring it.Came here around 9:30 at night and was easily seated, easily served. Everyone is given prepackaged plates, utensils, napkins. Food was served quickly and served hot. Not pipping hot, but hot enough. Probably the best meal I experienced in Singapore. Everywhere else is just to modernized for me. Just give me no frills tummy loving good grub!",

When you first come in you just sit down on a table and either go up to a stall and order something or people will come up to you. They're pretty aggressive in selling their food. Some sellers will help you find a table (but they expect that you buy food from their stall in return). You might as well let them do the work for you though. At worst they'll just be a bit unhappy.Food that you should try here: 1. Oyster Pancake - A egg like mixture with fresh oysters. 2. Sugar Cane with Lemon (Drink) - freshly ground sugar cane with lemon yum. 3. Chili Crab4. Stingray - If you can tolerate spiciness make sure to smear the entire thing with chili.

    "text": "So.... What's the big deal? What's with all the hype? After spending a few days in Singapore, we visited this hawker center for dinner on our last night, based on reviews and recommendations. The stars it gets are due to the fact that I loved the food at every hawker I visited, and Newton was no different. Let me lay out the negatives... - these vendors were the most aggressive I dealt with while in Singapore. It made the experience a bit less enjoyable. - this hawker center is seafood focused, and by that I mean bbq stingray. Everyone gets that here. If you love it, cool, but itdidn't suit my taste. Didn't hate it. Just didn't love it.- because this Center is focused on seafood, it's missing a lot of the variety of the other ones. Conclusion: if you want to try some bbq stingray, fried carrot cake, or oyster omelette, this is the place to do it. If not, you may want to try another hawker where the vendors are less aggressive and there is more food variety.",

They were overwhelmed to say the least- imagine if I had taken them to somewhere less ang moh friendly. Yes, because it's a little more tourist oriented it is a little more expensive, but it has a good array of food- satay to seafood and more. Also, they are really great about making sure you do not go without tiger beer. The best thing here is definitely the sambal stingray. as most reviewers mentioned. One big tip: they sometimes try to rip you off and you can get sticker shock when the bill comes. I try to pay for my dishes ASAP and buy beer one bottle at a time. This ensures you're keeping track of what you're spending. Happy eating in Singapore!",

Prices here are definitely higher than your typical hawker centre/ neighborhood food centre due to it being a popular tourist destination. Nonetheless, I wouldnt say that the quality of food is compromised.Service here is surprisingly good. There are stall helpers helping you find a table... but they may also pressure you to ordering from them. They are pretty active in coming up to you and asking for your order, but you can simply say no. Ventilation here is also decent. Close proximity to town, so I definitely recommend bringing foreign friends here to try the local fare, especially since Gluttons Bay can get really crowded at times.",

Now it's a sucky tourist destination.Part of the reason is that they stopped using pork lard in their cooking. This is to cater to the huge influx of Muslim tourist from the region.Really nothing against Muslims, just saying the food isn't the same. Pork lard is essential in Chinese cooking. Like ghee is to Indian cooking. We have a saying, \"No lard, no good\".But the main reason is the high rental cost. Lots of the original hawkers left and sub-leased the stall.There's still a few good stalls but most of them is crap. Go to Old Airport or East Coast Lagoon instead.",

From Crazy Rich Asians to Top Chef, this is the hawker center that I would recommend if you could only pick one. There's so many tourists here (including myself) and it has a great energy to it with excellent lighting and clean tables. The guy selling us the chili crab also actively was looking for tables. There's numbers on each table so you just order and tell them what number your table is and they will bring it to you. Most of them you don't pay until they come to you but some you pay up front. It's so much fun going around the different stands, what an experience!I tried the chili crab, some chicken skewers (local fav), a local \"burrito\" that they made with rice paper and pad thai noodles made to order, oyster pancake (my least fav), and of course sugar cane juice. This very friendly guy asked me if I wanted it with lemon and he said it was even better so I ordered it and it was soooo good. From the rest of the trip on, I only ordered it with lemon haha yeah super awesome!The hustle is real here (same with all hawker centers) but I did some research and wrote down the stall numbers on my phone so I knew where I was going. I think when they realized I was on a mission to find certain stalls, they let me be hahaA few tips: try to avoid peak hours if possible and also try to come on a weekday. It is outdoors so if it rains (which happens a few hours everyday in Singapore), there's very few tables with umbrellas on them. Most of the dessert places close early so don't expect to find dessert here. (that's ok lots of other places to go to!) Did I mention try the sugar cane juice with lemon?

Despite it being outdoors, the environment appeared very clean and well kept, a significant notch above Lau Pa Sat and Maxwell I loved the service. In spite of initially not wanting to order from one Seafood stall, the auntie there offered to distribute my order to the respective neighboring stalls, so it was essentially table service through a charitable restauranteur. A good selection of Oyster Scramble, Tulang Steak and other Muslim foods are outstanding selections of this Hawker Center in particular.",

    "text": "Newton Hawker Centre is one of the larger centres in Singapore with lots of food options to choose from. It is also the centre with more staff approaching patrons with menus and one to one sales techniques. I opted for the imfamous Soon Wah Fishball and Bee Heng Popiah! Soon Wah Fishballs are made in the traditional Teochew way. Each ball is handmade, kneaded for bounce and airyness. Fish meat is gentlely folded in, thereafter. Fish dumplings (probably best fish dumplings in Singapore and probably in life) are made from fish paste wrappers with meat filling. Each bowl is topped with crispy lard for texture and flavour! Yum! Soon Wah deserves to be in the Fishballs hall of fame!Bee Heng Popiah is also a legend in this hawker centre. Soft thin crepes are filled with combination of ingredients including bean a sprouts,\u00a0lettuce leaves etc. It is sweet and savory with crisp texture. This centre is what hawker legends are made of! If you love food, you must visit Newton Hawker Centre!",

Chillie Crab $36SG for 700gram from seafood alliance... $3 for the marn tdou bun.. my ping ting is non existent.. \u00a0it was medium size crab enough for 2. \u00a0Meat was fresh nice and firm. But definitely can not compare to the Australian Darwin mud crab!!! which is more flavourful. Well IMHO was good but i don't think is the best... the sauce / gravy was a bit too sweat.. over the years of coming in and out of SG I still haven't found a \"WOW\" Have been coming here on and off over the years and SG and I still haven't found a place that I can say... YEP I WOULD DEFINITELY RETURN for the crab. Any friendly yelpers out there with good suggestions... ideas most welcomed! :)) Chicken wing... wooooah!!! I'd come back for that alone!! Maaaan it was right size and had the chargrill flavour.. add the lime provided and a little dip into that sauce!!! Wooow! Overall it was a great experience washed down with a large bottle of Tiger for $7.50SG!! The growling jungle beats playing in my stomach due to hunger was very quickly replaced by carnivale!!!!",

    "text": "This is a food court located right near Novena circle and is probably the most affordable food court near Orchard road (aka Times Square and Fifth Avenue of Singapore). you can find local eats here for a decent price and it maintains much of Singapores authentic original flavors. Highly recommend the duck dark rice. \u00a0It is a good place to go in the evening and has fares such as satay, black pepper crab, duck rice, chicken rice, fish porridge, and other famous fares. I had the dark duck rice- if you like Hainanese chicken rice, then you want this dish- it is a darker dish than Hainanese chicken which has that chickeny taste that you can tell has a garlicky and simpler taste of chicken, but the duck rice has a hint of sweet, more herbs, and that heavier taste of duck that differentiates Chicken from duck. I personally love duck and if you like Peking Duck, then consider this dish. It is a Singaporean version of Peking duck over rice with a side of herbal soup (not a fan of the herbal too sweet aftertaste soup). It is not too heavy and is pleasant to the senses.batang fish porridge is also a must have for people who like their congees- the fish porridge is not so much congee but rather a fish soup poured over cooked rice but you:re really here to try to sweet flavor of mackerel that is what makes this soup really have that fishy but oceany taste that makes this dish great for either one who:s tired of the heavier dishes in Singaporean fare or wants comfort food. You cant go wrong with other Singaporean fares that I listed above if you:re new to singaporean food. For locals, this is an alright stall- a little higher on the price side and the hawkers are a little pushy and will pressure you to buying drinks and stuff. The prices are cash only for tourists and can be priced highly compared to other local hawker centers around Singapore. Leave your dishes when you:re done, someone will clean. bring your own napkins and cash to pay for your food.",

    "text": "Eeeeep. Not the nicest hawker centre around, and DEFINITELY not a good hawker centre for a vegetarian!I came here to meet friends and figured I'd be able to find at least one or two things suitable to eat, because so far Singapore has been ridiculous easy for me to navigate as a vegan. But hawker centres can be trickier, and this one was definitely the least vegan-friendly (let alone vegetarian-friendly) hawker centre that I came across.Plus I felt hassled by all the food vendors. I mean, yeah, I get it, they're hawkers, they're gonna hawk -- but they all seemed more aggressive here than anywhere else. I walked around in endless circles, trying to find something (ANYTHING!) non-meat and non-seafood to eat, and as a white person I kept getting asked, \"You want fried rice? You want fried rice?\" It was kinda funny but mildly insulting at the same time. Just because I'm white doesn't mean I want plain fried rice because I can't handle spicy or exotic foods.Finally, I grabbed a lychee drink (overpriced) and managed to find one lonely vegetarian plate on offer at an Indian stall. It was a curry (I specified no ghee and they grunted something that I assumed was acquiescence -- maybe they don't use much ghee here, I dunno). It was super-spicy (thank God someone sensed that my pasty complexion belies a spice-loving interior -- or more likely they just didn't care). It was actually pretty yummy, but more expensive than anticipated, and the lady that made it was sweating buckets over the stove, rings of sweat under her armpits, so I felt like my dish may have come with a tangy human-sweat aftertaste, but whatever.There were also pillars of smoke billowing everywhere, which was making a lot of people (I'm talking actual locals, not precious tourists) cough and wave their tissues in the air in front of them.Really not a pleasant hawker centre experience. There are better ones in Singapore. ESPECIALLY if you're vegetarian (much less vegan).",

You'll notice that they sell a lot of the same stuffs with slightly different variations. I got the sour sop juice and was not impressed.

    "text": "This is actually one of my least favorite hawker centers and it has little to do with the quality of the food. Many of the stalls here do a great job and serve very good food and I like the round design of the place which gives a nice overview.The issue here is however that people constantly bother you and trying to get you to order stuff. I mean if I sit with my food I do not want to be interrupted every 30 seconds by some placing a menu in front of me, asking me to order or even worse just trying to place a plate in front of me and pretend I ordered it. I was actually a bit surprised as I even had to tell one guy really harshly to stop bothering us. Also then saw the same guy screw some tourists that did not have the same sense out of 25 SGD for a plate of carrot cake.Perhaps unfair to all the good places here but I just find myself annoyed when I go here. I still occasionally go as friends live close by but then we usually take the food with us to avoid all the people bothering us.",
