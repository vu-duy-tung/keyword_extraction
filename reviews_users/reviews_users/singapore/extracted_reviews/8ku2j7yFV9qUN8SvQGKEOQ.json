But Foo Lin's ytf stands out from the rest as it comes with their secret recipe - minced chicken and mushroom broth that generously cover over the tou fu, veggies, rice and noodles. The fried stuff are placed safely away from the sauce to keep their crispiness intact - 10/10",

The yong tau fu is a dry/fried version with a savory sauce poured over it. Pair it with their signature thick bee hoon with the same sauce, it's comfort food at it's best.",

    "text": "This is the ampang Yong tau hu (YTH) style. Fried Yong tau hu pieces and you only have 2 types of carbo to choose from, thick Beehoon or rice. Trust me when I say that I've tried to ask if they have anything else. The man looked at me as if I'm an idiot for not understanding that they ONLY have the 2 selections. The deep frying makes everything taste better for my hubby. \u00a0He is not a fan of soft and soupy stuff so this type of YTH that makes him excited about dinner. I was tired so hubby offered to go pick and choose the YTH pieces and I regretted as the server brought over this high plate of mainly meat pieces. When questioned, hubby insisted that there were some brinjal pieces buried underneath somewhere. I rolled my eyes. But like I said, deeper fried YTH pieces can't go wrong and it's overall an enjoyable meal. One tip to remember is to eat the deep fried bits relatively quick else they will all turn soggy under the sauce. Else, tell them to not pour the sauce over the plate and give you the sauce in a bowl, on the side. This way, you can choose to dip the pieces in the sauce when you're eating. I would definitely return when I need my deep fried YTH fix!",

    "text": "FuLin YongTauFoo along east coast road isn't like your normal yongtaufoo. They have a wide range of items to choose from, all mainly under $1. Their speciality has to be their home-made prawn ngoh hiang ($2) is full of flavor, soft and succulent on the inside, they only make a limited number each day so be sure to get there early to get your fill. Served with either their meat sauce vermicelli or rice. It's definitely one I'll highly recommend. Well I like to believe that I'm having high class yongtaufoo. So when you're around the area next time, make sure you make a point to try it. #yongtaufoo #lunch #cravings #craving #cravingsatisfied",

    "text": "Right next to Siglap Center, you will find a Yong Tau Foo stall that serves their dishes in a style that differs from the ones that are commonly sold in hawker centers. Although Yong Tau Foo is a dish that people often eat for health purposes, the one at Fu Lin is definitely not what you should go for if you are seeking a healthy diet. Similar to other Yong Tau Foo stalls, you select a handful of ingredients like tofu, fishballs, ladyfingers, and ngo hiang, but unlike other stalls, Fu Lin deep fries your chosen items and completes the dish with a thick minced meat soy sauce. The items are accompanied by a bowl of thick white noodles doused in flavorsome minced chicken sauce. Even the healthier options like ladyfingers, eggplants and bitter gourds are deep-fried. But who am I to complain; deep fried fare can be wholesomely satisfying if cooked well, like at Fu Lin.",

    "text": "Seriously anything fried tastes awesome! I'm sure all of you agree with me. So think about it, fried yong tau foo and then this starchy thick braised gravy with minced meat is poured all over the golden brown babies.. I have arrived at YTH heaven, where fat cells expand and 6 packs abs are non-existent.My favorite items are the ngoh hiang, tau pok (really great for soaking the gravy), toufu and fish cake you tiao! Not the usual yong tau foo fan so i don't have those fish cake filled vege or chili. They do have that though. Seriously i can finish up all the gravy! Say hello to cellulite!!More gravy for the thick beehoon. I love the gravy because it's like the Taiwanese lu rou fan (braised meat rice) sauce. Ate tons of that in Taipei and i only found a comparable stall in Singapore (Full House at Central and Far East Plaza). Anyway, this is a twist to the rice but if you prefer rice they have that as well.Fu Lin is opened daily so you can get it for breakfast, lunch or dinner which is pretty awesome to me. I wouldn't have this in the morning though because this is pretty sinful even for me. Cheap cheap must eat! It's usually about 6 bucks per person inclusive of a drink. :) Do holler if you see me eating there!",

    "text": "The unique style of Yong Tau Foo here makes this place a must-try for all fans of Yong Tau Foo. Originally part of a coffeeshop along Siglap, it eventually moved out to this store on its own. \u00a0After picking your ingredients, everything is deep fried and served to you on a huge plate with either a bowl of thick BeeHoon in a soy based minced meat gravy or a plate of rice served with the same gravy on the side. There are a wide variety of ingredients to choose from that include your regular fried Yong Tau Foo ingredients like fish cakes, fish/meat balls and tofu however there are some of the usual steamed ingredients but whats different about this stall is that eventually, everything is deep fried before its served to you. Its a nice touch and makes it all quite delicious with the gravy. You'll face you usual parking woes during dinner time as there are very few lots to park at along the driveway right outside the restaurant however there are a few lots at the HDB carpark across the road and more available further up the road near the Shell Petrol kiosk near Jalan Tua Kong (about 5 minutes walk away).",

    "text": "This is a yong tau foo stall located in East Coast. I love yong tau foo because I feel that it is really value for money in terms of the amount of ingredients you could get for a relatively affordable sum of money, and you had the freedom to choose what you wanted so you would get a slightly different dining experience each time.Anyway, for the ingredients that I got this time, I ordered the goh hiong, tau pok, to fu and fish cake you tiao. The ingredients were all very fresh and very tasty, so no complaints there. I ordered the thick beehoon, which is a change from my usual preference for kway tiao. Anyway, the sauce that came with the thick bee hoon was heavenly. It's somewhat unlike what I usually have, and the sauce here is very fragrant, slightly sweet and went very well with all the ingredients. Overall, a great place to have some very delicious yong tau foo.",

    "text": "When I eat yong tau foo, it is because I want something soupy and healthy. So when I see a shop called Tou Fu Yuen selling yong tau foo, naturally, I went in expecting the best in healthy food selections. Lo and behold, first of all, you do not get a soup option. The horror, everything is deep fried. The person I was with was not feeling well and we though something soupy would be good for them and all we got was noodles with a meat sauce, similar to the taiwanese / hokkien braised meat rice. It is very difficult to get a seat during lunch time and there's a long wait. Once you place your order you get a number, go back to your seat, and wait. Even perfectly good things that do not need to be deep fried, gets deep fried. It's an absolutely frustrating place. They also sell some other western food like items in addition to the yong tau foo. It's a perplexing place for a first time visitor. I will consider going back but I'll make sure I am craving for deep fried choke to my arteries before I go back again.",
