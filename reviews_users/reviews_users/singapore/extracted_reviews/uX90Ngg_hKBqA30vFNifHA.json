    "text": "Decided to try LUXE for brunch on a Saturday morning. Service & Ambience 1.5/2starsArrived at 10, no issues getting a table for 4. We were attended to quickly with water and not long after for ordering. Staff friendly and at tentative throughout our brunch. Nice decor, ok vibe as seemed to be an 'older' crowdFood & Beverage 2/3 starsWife ordered the 'luxe bowl' with salmon ($24). Easily the best looking at tastiest dish out of everything we ordered. She was very happy with it and even struggled to get through it. I went the \u00a0Eggs Benedict with salmon ($21.50) and a flat white coffee ($5). Decent amount of salmon and hollandaise sauce which is always a good thing. Eggs were a little cold and I didn't like the thin wholemeal sour dough. Flat white was good but far too small. Kids got a Milo milkshake ($9) and some hashbrowns ($5). Both were good but other than that not a lot on the menu for kids.Value 0/1Overall the biggest disappointment is probably value for money, especially since the above excludes the ++ pricing. I'm happy to pay if the standard is there so whilst it was good I think it's 15-20pct over priced for what it is. Overall 3.5/5Would eat hear again although won't make one of my regular brunch spots.",

    "text": "Rating: 3.5/5 I've passed this place many times and there are many eateries in the area as well. Mainly passed it because there's usually always a decent amount of people around brunch times especially on the weekend. I like that they are a part of sites that let you make reservations. I'd definitely take use of that if and when you visit. I went for dinner with some friends. Overall it was a good meal. Food: Decent selection. - The Luxe burger is a typical ground beef burger, it was flavorful and juicy. Better than the pulled pork. - Pulled pork burger was a too dry for my liking and so with the bread from the bun, even more dry feeling. - Appetizer pork sausage roll. Was good but nothing out of the ordinary in my opinion. - Prawn linguini. Good. It was smaller entree in comparison to others we ordered. - Mushroom and veggie lasagna. Yummy. I enjoyed this. Id ask for less dressing on the side salad, way too much! - Truffle Parmesan tries. Really good and hit the spot. Exactly what I wanted it to taste like when we ordered it. Service: overall great! Attentive and nice. But there was one girl, who just didn't seem to smile or seemed like she didn't want to be there. So it was just off putting especially when she would tend to our table. Atmosphere: chill. Love the white more modern contemp feel. Tip: make reservations so you don't have to wait",

    "text": "This review is for Sunday Brunch. The naturally lit modern space with a mix of high low tables was a good place to catch up with 5 friends I hadn't seen in a few months. \u00a0 The staff was friendly, attentive and quick.Everyone had good things to say about the food: \u00a0The burger was big and juicy, The chicken burger was cooked just right, the Miso mushrooms were flavorful, the chicken wings were wonderful, the eggs benedict with salmon was tasty. \u00a0I had the Goat Cheese/Avocado plate and I'd order that again on my next visit.Four of us had the Bloody Mary. It was an enigma. \u00a0We all agreed that it was either the best or the worst one we'd ever had. \u00a0So much flavor. \u00a0The bartender was either a genius or an incompetent fool. \u00a0(I'm leaning to the former) Was the secret ingredient pickle juice? \u00a0One thing is for certain is that It was made to sip. \u00a0 With the perfect amount of vodka, I'm not saying it was good, but we each had 2 and could have ordered a third if we weren't sipping them so slowly.The Good: \u00a0The Food, The Ambiance, The Staff, The Bloody MaryThe Bad: \u00a0The Bloody MaryThe Verdict: \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Book a table and order the Bloody Mary. \u00a0You'll either love or hate me for the recommendation. \u00a0Either way you'll leave tipsy.",

    "text": "I think Luxe was okay. I'll give it 3.5 stars. It wasn't too bad. Saturday brunch meant that it was nice vibe although it quickly became noisy. We looked at the menu and realized that the eggs section was slightly more expensive than usual. We decided to order the eggs and sides separately in order to get eggs with one side of veggies and one meat. This came up to SGD24 with no hollandaise sauce. If you want a \"pre-set\" eggs dish, it will be SGD21 - poached eggs and one side (either veg or meat) & hollandaise sauce. Okaaaay. I guess we wanted a more balanced meal and decided to pay for more. Guess the word \"luxe\" is there for a reason. HahaAnyway, the servers were friendly and the decor very contemporary. I would have killed for that ONE table at the back that was by the window with natural sunlight streaming in. Otherwise, it gets dim even during the day. The food underwhelmed me, truth be told. I glean that their pancakes are good and will go back for that. Oh oh oh - their iced latte was solid. A very good one. And well-priced at $5.",

    "text": "So... on Luxe. Friend called up AFTER I had my brunch saying that this place looks good and ask me to join her for (my second) brunch. Place is easy enough to find, setting is more spacious than alot of cafes in Singapore. Fairly packed when I arrived. My friends ordered and I just added on a long black and a plate of fries (well, it WAS my SECOND brunch... give me a break ;) ). Food was OK (yes, of course I picked on my friends plates), but nothing to shout about. I guess there are so many of these places, it provides people with the option, but not many stand out and up above the crowd. It then boils down to personal preference... which again.... my cuppa may not be your cuppa....",

    "text": "A friend and I ended up at Luxe because it had a diverse menu, and was open for lunch. Other eating places in this hip part of town tend to open only for dinner, or had a more limited menu for undecided eaters.The service was good, the ambiance was nice, and the ricotta pancake was awesome, but notice that I only mentioned a pancake? For $20, you get 1 pancake. Sam W. who complained about the price of eggs would be appalled by the price of the pancakes.Granted the food was good, it was not good value. I've been to other brunch places that were of similar quality for $5-10 less per entree. That is a significant price difference.I probably wouldn't come back for brunch. I wonder if it's better at night.",

Sides are 5/6$ extra. Flavors were underwhelming and unimpressive. I've had better gastronomical experiences at MCdonalds.The ricotta hotcake was probably one of the best pancakes I've ever had. Tasty, fluffy with a layer of crisp on the outside. Ricotta tasted like it was spiked with powdered creamer.",

    "text": "Not Bad.For a place I confused with a budget hotel breakfast lobby, not bad.Although the day light menu is different from the dinner menu, a-la The Lokal, it's overall not bad.Some hits and misses.I know I'm supposed to reveal what we ordered, but I don't remember the names. All I remember was my emotions...which were, slightly changed from the norm. Not min blowingly creative, but a good stab at it.Jamon was good, Roasted cauliflower with pine nuts was ok. Not much flavor aside from the cauliflower, but it was healthy. Next was grilled octopus with XO sauce. Again, interesting flavour, but not amazing. Different.Then we ordered a half bird, chicken. That was really tender, juicy, soft and flavorful! I was surprised and kept going at it!Then, my freinds ordered pastas, of which I cannot comment.The service was good. It was 70% full, and the servers were moderately attentive, and the speed of food service was good. I wouldn't return, unless I'm in the area, and feel like sampling their brunch menu.Other than that, for a low budget version of Lollapalooza and Neon Pidgeon, you really can't go wrong.",
