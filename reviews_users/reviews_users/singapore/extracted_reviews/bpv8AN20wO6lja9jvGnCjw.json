BBBS DOESN'T serve food people! \u00a0If the food was poor, please make your feelings known in true Yelp! fashion, in a properly crafted review filled with the invective that your offended soul truly deserves. Pan the joint righteously, but pan the right joint.",

A good place to relax, eat and catch up with friends over a nice jug of kronenbourg blanc.But like many others the food was so so. Had the butter chicken recommended to me by the waiter who forgot my naan and came 5 mins after. So it was preheated and I waited for my friends blue cheese burger which tasted so so that came 30 mins later. My other friend's pasta also came at the same time with the burger, but it was the wrong order. Mushroom instead of prawn pasta which he ordered. Another 30 mins flew by, by this time my butter chicken was just nasty.Great company, so I'm not complaining. Will I come back? Prob not.",

I waited for my lunch for 30min; the roast beef sandwish was a piece of rubbery meat, and the fries were cold. I had to remind them of my ceasar salad, and it came as some lettuce leaves with already made ceasar sauce from a bottle, and they didn't even mix the salad! Not to forget, the bread for my roast beef sandwich was hard to bite on! They have no clue how to make a roast beef sandwich!",

    "text": "BBBS has been my watering hole and neighbourhood pub in this area for some time now. The casual concept of having a good and cheapish bar with very decent Indian and Western and Asian food clearly works for them -- at one point, I think they have the best burgers in Singapore. This is no longer so but they certainly built up a reputation for having more than decent pub grub with affordable beers, that they've now expanded to two other locations (one in Robertson Quay, one in Katong).The Bukit Timah BBBS is still my favourite. It's set in a leafy residential neighbourhood near Sixth Ave. Seating is outdoor and non-airconditioned, but you don't usually need it because there tends to be enough of a breeze to sit outdoors. As you kick back on large wooden tables and chairs you start to realize that this doesn't really feel very much like Singapore. It's got a nice vibe that reminds me of being on holiday in somewhere like Thailand, but of course that could just be the effect of too much beer :)",

    "text": "Located along Bukit Timah road, this bar is a great place to have a drink and catch up with friends. Often crowded but not too noisy and somehow you'll always be able to find a seat. Food to try here include the garlic naan and curries which are a great pair with your beer or cider however you like it. If you're not in the mood for Indian food, try the escargot instead or even spring rolls with spicy dip. The only set back here is Bar Bar Black Sheep is a cash only place so do come prepared as there are no Atm's in the vicinity! A great place for drinks after work on weekdays!",
