Deciding to continue with the spicy theme started at Aromas of India, this small Thai restaurant in the basement looked promising, and indeed I wasn't disappointed. The friendly hostess took my order on her iPad and in short order I received the assorted hors d'oeuvres, comprised of tasty Satay, shrimp cups and eye-watering Larb Tord pork balls. Next up was soft shell crab pad Thai and green curry rice with salted egg, both exceptionally yummy (and not especially salty). The parent restaurant in Bangkok is highly regarded, and clearly the tastes have been transferred to this outpost in Singapore.",

I came here with a party of four.We ordered a variety of dishes and I thought everything was rather tasty. I've never had Thai food outside of the United States so this was a first! Everything is a lot spicier here and there are certain dishes that are missing from the menu (where is my pad see ew). We got the papaya salad and it was incredibly spicy but rather tasty. I like strong savory flavors and thought this one was great. The heat from the salad was a killer though and I'm pretty sure I started sweating at one point.The tom yum soup was also delicious and quite spicy. I love rich flavorful soups and this was good.We also got the dessert that looked like flour or rice balls in a coconut sweet broth (like Chinese tong yuan). They tasted really good and not super sweet. I like Mochi like items so this was a good fit for me.Service was kind of hit or miss despite nobody being in the restaurant though.If I'm in Singapore again I'd love to try this place again.",

Menu was quite extensive and price was higher than average. I decided to splurge a bit and tried the claypot of vermicelli with tiger prawns. The vermicelli has infused the essence of the fresh prawns and the portion was satisfactory. The iced milk tea was disappointing though. We asked if it was possible to have a less sweet version and were surprised when the waitress said we could give such an order. The tea that got served was still too sweet and definitely not worth S$5.90 before tax. My friend ordered stir fried vegetables and some of them were rather hard. Overall still a positive experience.",

There are only 3 options for now and I have only tried the basil chicken with fried egg and rice set. It comes with prawn tom yam soup and a choice of drink. I usually have the Thai iced milk tea which is really good.The portions could be smaller than a la carte but I find it sufficient and filling. The basil chicken with fried egg is flavorful and spicy. The spice level is medium and you could ask for more or less spicy when placing your order. I finally found a use for the cucumber which does help to tone down the fiery heat on the tongue. The tom yam soup is creamy and also spicy with the tangy sweetness of the tamarind. They are generous with providing 3 prawns and some straw mushrooms in the soup. None of those watered down soup here. The Thai iced milk tea finished off the meal with a sweet aftertaste. Coffee and lemongrass are also part of the choice if I remember correctly. The other two options are:1. boat noodle (choice or pork or beef), pandan chicken, mango salad (I think, either that or papaya salad) and drink. 2. curry pork and some side dish and the drink. I cannot recall what is in the \u00a0set now.Lunch set is only available on Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays etc.",

We ordered a basil pork with rice and a beef kuay Teow and a plate of veggies. Just basics to test the place out. Jasmine rice comes dyed blue, which is a nice visual touch but adds nothing otherwise. Basil pork was very spicy, to the extent it radiated through my head and numbed my mouth. Tasted nice enough.Disappointed that the fried egg was well-done as I always like a runny yolk with my Thai food. According to the waiter it's how the Chef always does it. Nonetheless, big minus for me...Kuay Teow was nice enough without being spectacular. Service was good and the waitresses were very pleasant in a \"Thai way\". Even with the entertainer, the few dishes came up to $42 which probably wasn't worth it. If you want good Thai food for half the price, go to Aroy Dee onMiddle Rd instead.",

He ordered Kao Phad Kung Fried rice with prawns $14.90 and seriously not just the taste was SO bland (wayyy bland than mine), it only came with 3 small prawns.. Service was bad.

Chicken satay5. Chicken wrapped in pandanus leafThis was for 3 of us, and it was enough for 4 (I had the leftover from dinner the next morning). The star was the Pad Thai - having attempted this dish several times at home, I know how challenging it is to get the spices just right. This tasted exactly how it would back in Thailand at the Erawan Team Room where I used to diner almost Every. Single. Day. (I kid you not - they still remember my name and order whenever I go). The morning glory and sliced beef had too much gravy for my liking. It could have been \"drier\" and would have enhanced the taste. It also was a little bit too spicy. Chicken wrapped in pandanus leaf was tender and the spices were delicious. My mother had two helpings - a rare sight. Chicken satay was a little too tense.. it tasted good, but I assume that it was on the grill for perhaps a few minutes too long. I do recommend this place, though.",

I also added on Pandan Chicken, Thai Fish Cakes and Coconut Ice Cream with Red Rubies, as well as an Anchan Cooler.The Anchan Cooler is a premium drink - at $2.90 it, together with the Roselle (Hibiscus) Cooler, is more expensive than the Lemongrass or Pandan Coolers. The taste is not for everyone - it had a vaguely plum-y taste, with a sour note.The Fried Sesame Chicken came in the shape of 3 rather small pieces, which seemed to be mid-wing joints. The pieces were slightly dry, but that's not unusual for this kind of fried chicken and the dish was a decent appetiser.The Pandan Chicken unfortunately hardly tasted of Pandan, was a little dry and the two pieces we got were quite small too (relatively small servings seem to be a hallmark of this place - or at least its weekday lunch sets). Given that many other places (even much cheaper ones) can do decent Pandan Chicken, this is quite surprising (and even unforgivable for such an upscale joint).The fish cakes were pretty good - moist and flavourful.Happily the main event - the Ayutthaya Boat Noodles - was really good. The soup was full of flavour (it didn't seem to just be the MSG) and the pork balls were quite bouncy, tasty and juicy. And everything was topped with crispy fried bits, which added a contrasting texture to the dish (and even more taste to the stock). The slices of pork were a little too tough though. The soup was so good that I slurped it all up - even though I normally don't finish spicy soups.I ended off with Coconut Ice Cream. Virtually all Thai Coconut Ice Cream I've had is bursting with flavour, and this didn't disappoint. It was a little too melted when I got it, so ideally they'd store it at a lower temperature so it reaches the customer still-frozen, but that's a minor point. What made this version stand out was the Red Rubies - they tasted fresher than other Red Rubies I've had, and had a particular note to them (possibly more water chestnut).While I'm giving it 4 stars, an important caveat is that this was for the lunch set price. I had a look at the a la carte menu and it made my eyes open wide. If the quality of those dishes is similar, I would take this down a star to reflect the relatively poor value (you're better off going to other Thai places to get bang for your buck).",

My husband and I love Thai food and the only other authentic place we've been able to find in Singapore has been Folks Collective. So we were ecstatic to try out Nara as well. We started off with the salmon tartar salad with Thai herbs, which was extremely flavorful and paired well with the crunchy veggies they give you on the side. Pomelo salad was good, but a bit on the sweet side. \u00a0We also tried the butterfly pea juice, which was tangy and nice..tasted similar to roselle juice to me. \u00a0For our main we ordered the stir-fried soft shell crab with yellow curry. This dish knocked our socks off! It was very rich and indulgent, maybe a little too sinfully delicious :) We paired this with the thai herbs fried rice. \u00a0The rice was really good but a bit steep at $10 for just one scoop. Next time I might just get the jasmine rice ($2.50), although we really wish they offered red or brown rice like most of the places in Bangkok seem to do for a more healthy alternative. Also, thumbs up for friendly and smooth service, even on opening weekend :)",

The chicken breast pieces are tasteless though.Service is fast. The plate given to me is not clean. Dried pieces of food is still firmly stuck on it.",

The saut\u00e9ed morning glory is really delicious and flavorful, the chicken basil rice set is decent (aside from the rice being blue for no reason) .. It's a pretty legit place. My only little gripe about this place is that they took forever to bring out the water .... It's water. It's not like they have to make it.",

    "text": "Nara Thai supposed to be the best Thai restaurant in Thailand but I beg to defer. I was there last week and the food was rather....disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad but it just doesn't live up to my expectation as THE best Thai food from Bangkok.As a starter, we ordered the Assorted Nara Hors d'oeuvre and the Rice Crackers with Pork&Prawns Coconut Dip. Out of the 3 items from the assorted platter, I only liked the fish cakes. The rice cracker was interesting, but not fantastic.For mains, we had the Stir-fried Soft Shell Crab in Yellow Curry, Tom Yum Kung, Stir-fry Kale in Oyster Sauce, Basil Minced Pork, Phad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice and Braised Noodle in Oyster Sauce.The supposedly signature Soft Shell Crab in Yellow Curry was forgettable. The crab was tiny and not crispy, while the sauce was too thick. My friends joked that the curry tasted like the Twisties curry seasoning.Do not every order the Braised Noodle! It was deep-fried hor fun with oyster sauce. The hor fun was fried till crispy and the sauce was tasteless. The only saving grace was the Tom Yum Kung. It was a pretty big serving with big prawns. The soup was the right level of sour+spicy-ness.I don't think I will come back again. If you happen to be in Orchard and looking for good Thai Food, my suggestion would be walk further down to Orchard Tower. There are many small stores serving authentic Thai food there.",

Its not even fine dining or anything, its just dark and too many dark color in it. Add a higher watt of yhe light, trust me your place will get more crowded a little.waitress face not interested no idea they are sleepy because its dark or simply they are just unhappy.I like their curry crab. It will be better if they can make big fresher crab than soft shell battered crab. Tom yum is good. Som tum portion is too small. Vegetable dish is all sweet and boring there.",
