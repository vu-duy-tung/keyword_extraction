    "text": "This place was recommended by a friend for my trip to Singapore. I am SO happy to have taken her advice. I felt like I was in Italy again listening to the staff speak Italian. After I ordered the penne with crab and a glass of chianti, I was brought complimentary bruschetta. Yum!! My main course was delectable. Seriously...I ate every bite of that plentiful crab and the al dente pasta. Wine was perfect as well. Although I was full...I \"forced\" myself to have the tiramisu. It reminded me of some I had in Italy..creamy with a beautiful presentation as well. I was also surprised with a lemon shot arriving with my bill. Best. Meal. Yum. I will definitely come back on my next trip to Singapore.",

    "text": "I love Italian food and was very happy when I found out about this place in our hood.The restaurant is located in one of the shop houses on Cantonment road and you cannot really miss it: it is painted in Italy's national colours. Bold choice but there we go.We got a larger table in the centre of the restaurant after a small \"discussion\" with one of the waiters as he wanted to place us behind the entrance door and argued that he might need the bigger tables later on when they get busy. As I had a table reserved - hinting that it was our anniversary - I had expected something else than the back of the entrance, thus I did not like that part of the evening especially when, later on, lots of tables became available.The evening got much better after that as we started with Prosecco, parmigiana and octopus - and their amuse bouche which was a lovely bruschetta.For mains we ordered tagliatelle with lobster and pasta with mussels and fish roe, and had a wonderful bottle of Sauvignon Blanc to drink.It all tasted very fine and very authentic - I loved the fact that most employees spoke Italian and that Italian music was blaring from the speakers. Only the interior could benefit from a bit more \"love\", like tablecloth and candles. It all seems a bit too rustic for my taste, as if \"unfinished\".The dessert - a delectable Tiramisu - was the perfect ending, with some Limoncello on the house. We walked back home with some Adriano Celentano still in the back of our minds - Bellissimo!",

Aside from the beautiful deco and warm hospitality, the food was amazing! Their starter was not just bread but burchettas. And they were so delightful. We wanted more but were worried about not finishing our mains. I had Carbonara Di Mare and it was sooooooo good. Ingredients were fresh and the sauce so yummy. The only problem with me and cream sauce was that I get ger-lat quickly. So it would be perfect if I could share it with another tomato pasta. I'm not even kidding when I say EVERY dish we had was wonderful. Every one. From the starters to the desserts, all wonderful! We did feel the dessert was a little small for the price but having said that, we won't be able to fit a larger dessert! I'm definitely bringing my hubby here to savour their good food!",

I wouldn't rave about it quite as much as others, but it is a place I'd recommend. \u00a0The biggest issue for me is that it is too pricey for pasta dishes, calamari and other appetizers. That's the one thing that will make me think twice about returning.",

The old location felt really homey and quaint with its mismatched furniture and shophouse feel but the new spot is modern and polished. Still think this spot is one of the best places for consistently delicious Italian food without breaking the bank.",

    "text": "The ambiance of the restaurant was casual and the atmosphere decent. \u00a0Being somewhat casual, diners brought their kids who made lots of noise, clanging on dishes with silverware, or kids running around unsupervised.Located in a shop house, facing the busy Cantonement road and near the Outram Park MRT station, it was easy to find. \u00a0From the moment we were greeted by the hostess to the time we left, the service was inattentive and impersonal.The food was of mixed quality. \u00a0The complimentary bruschetta contained quality and fresh ingredients and the tomato base was very fresh. \u00a0When my guest asked in Italian what were the ingredients, the server who clearly can speak Italian, responded shortly with \"tomato\" then left.Our eggplant appetizer was nice and flavorful. \u00a0While the portion size was good, at $28, I felt the dish was over priced. \u00a0That was one of the more inexpensive appetizers with many ranging into the mid $30's.We ordered the tagliatelle with Tuscan ground beef. \u00a0The sauce had a nice beef flavor but otherwise tasted like typical beef ragu sauce. \u00a0The pasta was served watery and that seriously diluted the flavor of the dish. \u00a0At the high end of $30's for this dish, I expected a lot more.We then had a mixed seafood grill main to share. \u00a0That \u00a0was a lovely dish - the fish, calamari, shrimp, were nicely grilled and very fresh. \u00a0The charcoal grill favor reminded me of fresh seafood I enjoyed in Italy during my last trip to the Amalfie coast.Finished with a cup of $9 machiattor coffee.I had to flag down one of the servers to order a second bottle of Pellegrino ($10 a bottle) and ask two different servers before receiving the bill. \u00a0The hostess/waitress did stop by once to refill my glass.The bill for my portion: \u00a0one appetizer, one pasta, one main, and one coffee, two bottles of Pellegrino, plus tax and service charge was over $150.For a semi-casual trattoria, the food was decent but not particularly note worthy. \u00a0Combine that with sub-par service and high price, there are far better choices in Singapore.",

The fried calamari is alright except cut into too big pieces. \u00a0Our main course is risotto with black ink sauce and it is quite good. The other main course is the linguini lobster and it is not very good. They put too much linguini and the lobster has very little flavor. We decided not to stay for desserts . It is definitely not a 5 stars.",
