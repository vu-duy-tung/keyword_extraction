We had Pho Tai, Pho Bo and the mixed spring roll plate accompanied by the best Vietnamese iced coffee I have ever had and a refreshing tiger beer. Pho 99 is located across from a popular hawker center yet the Resturant was totally packed showing how good it was.",

The signature Beef Pho and Chicken Pho soup is too sweet for our palate. Usually we finished every bit of the pho soup but not this. Price is reasonable though. Don't think I'll come back. Sad though because they've got a good location.",

So it was still satisfying nevertheless. I tried it before year's ago, nothing seem to change. Like a place that sustained the chance of time in Cbd area. \u00a0I would like it to have Seracha chillies sauce . Slightly disappointed ...",

    "text": "Underrated honest Vietnamese place round the corner at Amoy street, offering generous bowls of pho and bun cha (vermicelli) at very reasonable prices - can't find this value for money in the cbd! It's a crowd favourite during lunch hour and service is really efficient, but it was a much more pleasant dining experience with peace and quiet in the evening (opens till 9pm on weekdays). Vietnamese spring rolls were awesome, and my favourite has got to be the fried version with just the right amount of crunch, juiciness and bite, the skin fried till crisp but not greasy, and best of all paired with their homemade sweet chili sauce which is really addictive. My partner got the classic beef pho which was really flavourful and sweet - perhaps sweeter than those you get in Vietnam but to each his own. Can't emphasise enough how generous the serving was. I had spring roll vermicelli (dry) and the springy vermicelli noodles and fresh green vegetables drenched in sweet Chili sauce offered a great contrast to the fried spring rolls it came with. We also had honey chicken wings which was surprisingly good. Beef pho, spring rolls vermicelli, fried chicken wings x2, mixed platter spring rolls (comes with 2 Vietnamese 3 fried), 2 lemon barley drinks all only amounted to $34.50. A very satisfying meal which we couldn't finish cos we totally over ordered but no regrets. Definitely a favourite haunt from now on :)",

    "text": "This is a review of a lunch with a colleague at PHO Vietnamese Delights.It is located in the lineup of shop houses on Amoy Street.tinyurl.com/c82orlvWe had a meeting in area. \u00a0After some discussion, we decided to go for Pho at Pho Vietnamese Delights. \u00a0Another co-worker gave it props.It was pretty busy. \u00a0There was a queue. \u00a0Because there were only two of us, they ushered us in and sat us down at a makeshift table. \u00a0We were cozily sharing a four-top with a couple of women. \u00a0I am not sure they were overly pleased to have a huge American sat down at their slightly cramped table. But, we all made do.The ambiance is crowded and a bit jumbled. \u00a0But, we were there for the Pho.The staff is proficient. \u00a0However, do not expect them to ask how your day is or may small-talk. \u00a0But, then again, we were there for the Pho.I had been feeling a bit under the weather for a stretch. Pho sounded just like the thing I needed.Almost immediately, our order was taken. \u00a0Before you could say Humpty Dumptyy, the food was out.Cripsy Spring Roll - This is just what a crispy spring roll should be. \u00a0Nothing more, nothing less. \u00a0Crispy on the outside, tender fresh ingredients on the insude. \u00a0Spot-on!tinyurl.com/cbq3ne4PHO - Maybe this isn't the best Pho in the world. \u00a0Maybe it certainly doesn't stack up head to head with a Pho in Hanoi. \u00a0Did I mention that we weren't in Hanoi? \u00a0But that doesn't mean it wasn't a pretty darn good Pho. \u00a0It hit the spot. \u00a0Like the spring roll, it was very much what I expect in the dish. \u00a0There was a hearty broth, tasty meat, well cooked noodles, and other fresh ingredients. My colleague thought the same.tinyurl.com/cu3zl27. Overall - This is a speedy 100% no frills lunch featuring a pretty good Pho. \u00a0If I was in the area, I wouldn't have any issue popping in for another bowl of noodle soup. \u00a0I would even walk a few blocks to get it.",

Cut to the chase, the Pho here is so-so only, lacking the kick you normally get with the Pho back in Vietnam. The soup was kind of flat and the beef was not tender at all. The spring rolls - better than average. Would I come back again - probably not unless I have a sudden graving Vietnamese food.......",
