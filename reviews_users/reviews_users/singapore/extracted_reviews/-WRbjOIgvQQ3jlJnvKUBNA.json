The ambience at the rooftop bar is very chill and you get a great view of the Marina Bay area if you get a seat at the edge.Food-wise, I felt the sushi was decent, but if you really like good quality sushi please go elsewhere. It's more bar-food sushi than anything else.Loved their Kinki specials (drinks) though. They were really good! I can't really remember what I ordered but I remember wanting to order more and more.",

The price for food is in the upper range which is being compensated by the quality. The environment is nice so far or maybe I have just been lucky. I'm not into the pretentious places and so far Kinki this is not the case at all during my visits.The setup of this venue is ideal be it for a lunch or dinner, meeting or date.I'm not big on drinking a lot when eating sushi however they have a bar there which by itself is worth visiting as well. The pricing is ok, all in ~18$ for a drink.Enjoy ~ !!-s",

What better place to reintroduce my tongue to Japanese than the uber-swanky new Japanese restaurant Kinki. \u00a0The place is decorated with koi acrylic floor paintings, Oishinbo inspired food portraits on the walls, and very low furniture making it seems futuristic and modern. Also the view is breathtaking.I had the edamame (salted to perfection), vegetable tempura (best I've ever had), and pomegranate miso black cod while my companions stuck mostly to sushi. \u00a0The sashimi we saw coming out of the kitchen made me drool by the way. \u00a0All of the food was spectacular and obviously was washed down with sake. \u00a0I would just caution that the miso was just barely cooked which I'm sure is the method de jour but I am just barely adult enough to handle undercooked fish. \u00a0Stick with the raw stuff if this bothers you too. \u00a0The sushi I was able to sneak off my husband's plate was fun and inventive and really tasty.At present the clientele is mostly older business gentleman. I suggest we turn this around and make it a haunt for the younger foodie crowd. \u00a0You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Utterly Disappointed - i had the worst Singapore dining experience here the other night. Sorry to say this as Kinki has a cool vibe and a nice rooftop where i've taken guests in the past. I thought the staff was poorly trained and the dine-in policies bizarre and inflexible. Suffice to say, I wont be going back.I attended my friends birthday party at Kinki where she reserved a table for 20 from 6 - 9 PM. My partner and I arrived about 1 hour late and at that time the table (for 14) that was given to us was over-packed already. We noticed that the table for four next to our large party was available and I asked to sit there so we could be close to the birthday party. We were told by the wait-staff that the table was reserved. Ok no issues, we were only 2 people and didnt want to take up the larger table so we asked to sit at a 2 person table in the vicinity of the party. Again, that table was reserved. We then approached the manager and told them of our situation: we had a party for 20 but were seated in a 14 person table but we arrived late and the wait staff wont let us sit at the tables nearby. So how?The manager let us know at that point that the entire restaurant was booked for the night. Perplexed, I looked around the restaurant of (im estimating) 30 tables and only 8 of them were occupied. As we were with the large birthday party, i inquired if could eat quickly at any one of the reserved tables before the parties arrived and was told that we could not as the tables were reserved. I then asked what time the people were coming for their reservation for the tables near the birthday party and were told that she didnt know. Then I asked since they didnt know, if we could eat and if the party came, they could be seated at another one of the 15 open two seater tables. Again, I got the \"cannot sir\". I asked her \"so you are telling me that we are here for a birthday party already eating, you have 75% of your restaurant unoccupied and you are not letting us eat\". The only reply i got was sorry the restaurant is reserved. I thought this was odd, and we were left awkwardly hovering near the birthday party table for about 10 minutes while they hurriedly finished eating. At that point we were told by the birthday girl that we had a reservation upstairs at the bar and that they had some bar snacks that we could eat. We hovered and waited for critical mass to finish eating and headed up stairs to the open air bar area. Despite a reservation for 20, Kinki gave us a table to seat 4 but was in the corner so we had some standing room only spots. We ordered a few bottles with all the mixers and ice buckets so there was little room for us to order food to eat. I asked the bar wait-staff, if we could sit at the table next to ours so that we could order some bar food to eat. Again, that table was reserved. Looking around there was our party of 18-20, and about 8 other people in the rooftop bar area and about 15 open tables. I asked the wait staff what time the table was reserved for and he said 10pm. Looking down at my watch, it was only 8 so i asked him to give us the seat for 30 mins so we could quickly eat and then we would go back to the original table. He said, sorry the table was reserved and walked away. However, he then came back a few minutes later and nicely said okay we could site there for an hour. Another wait-staff took our order and being vegetarian I ordered the Vegetarian Okonomiyaki. He told me that the Okonomiyaki was not available. There weren't many vegetarian bar snack options so I asked if i could order from the restaurant menu. \"No, you cannot\". I asked where the bar snacks were being prepared and he answered \"the restaurant downstairs\". Odd... I told him nevermind and that I ordered a drink. When he came to bring my drink he apologized and told me that the Okonomiyaki was available so I confirmed the Okonomiyaki order.The vegetarian Okonomiyaki was brought out abut 30 mins later and it wasnt Okonomiyaki looking at all. It was mayonaise atop toasted bread but wasnt bad tasting until I bit into something that tasted like chicken. At this point i was about to lose my sh*t. I asked my meat eating friends if it tasted like chicken and 2 out of 3 agreed. I approached the wait staff and \u00a0told them annoyingly that they had served me meat on a vegetarian dish. The wait-staff shook his head violently and flapped his arms up and said looking even more annoyed than me, \"that was vegetarian\". They sent another wait-staff who confirmed that it was mozzarella cheese. I never really knew mozzarella cheese and chicken could be so easily confused and let my friends eat the rest of my dish. No dinner for me after 3 hours of trying, thanks Kinki!",

I really like the vibes, as it reminds me of another painfully trendy place in London called Aqua Kyoto. I come here with colleagues after work sometimes. It's a good spot for post-work and farewell drinks. The drinks are OK-ish price wise (a Gin & Tonic costs around $12+++ I think) . I suppose you can expect to pay a little more for the ambience, etc.As Kinki is an open roof top bar, it can get a little warm on some nights. They do have fans etc. to alleviate the warmness though. It's usually busy and crowded. They play good music which sometimes veers on excessively loud to me (maybe I'm getting old?), so expect to do more shouting than talking.",

I really liked the roof top concept though and would love to go back and check more of it out. I've also heard good things about the music at the bar. However the closing of the bar at 11.30 is quite the downer, seeing how popular it is with the working crowd. We had to leave to go to Overeasy nearby because of that.The location also overlooks our beautiful Singapore skyline and buildings. The drinks are priced higher than normal but not that astronomical. What I really liked is the vibe and crowd.",

It's the perfect balance between casual and chi-chi, yet also trendy with a great vibe with good service and a view of the water.Food : Ooh I love the foie gras and scallop sushi! Totally melts in my mouth. Also really like the wagyu aburi sushi, salmon belly aburi sushi, unagi and anago sushi as well as the botan ebi and uni aburi sushi ... all pretty tasty! We also really like the momotaro tomato with ginger dressing and snow crab, organic tofu and century egg with ponzu sauce and ginger. The grilled black cod marinated in Kinki pomegranate-honey miso served with braised gobo and scallions is supposed to be a Kinki specialty, but we thought it was just so-so. The wagyu ribeye cooked over cast iron seasoned with truffle sauce was pretty good as was the pan seared kurobuta pork belly served with Kinki's spicy sesame sauce. We were not impressed by the Kinki okonomiyaki, i.e. a Japanese styled pizza of Hokkaido scallops, prawns,apple wood smoked bacon, sweet onions and mozzarella. Kinki doesn't have a wide selection of desserts so we tried the most exotic sounding one i.e. the Oreo Sesame, which is black sesame ice-cream blended with Oreo cookies. Predictably it was a bit too sweet and heavy.Ambience : Love it love it love itService : Pleasant, welcoming and efficientPrices are a bit steep but the fusion sushi is great.",

So getting here early ensures you'll get a good use of them before the reservees show up (and sometimes they don't). Best bang for buckets are the Kronenbourg 1664. All iced up you'll be knocking these puppies back whilst you drink in that view and soak up those tasty tunes.This is a bi-monthly stop and it never fails to entertain and delight.The one downside is the toilets are a slow elevator ride away. However, if your wallet is fat the sushi/sashimi located on the same floor is as sexy as the name suggests, so you can always relocate post happy hour tipple!",

Terrible service - took at least 20 minutes to bring a drink and the waitress with the dyed blue hair was extremely rude. She had an attitude and did not want to serve us. It was also very hard to track down anyone to ask questions about the menu or even take our order. When we finally got someone to help us, they told us the wrong info as we asked for example how many pieces of sushi comes with the Kinki Customs and he said two when infact it was 6 when it came out. My one friend waited for over an hour for her vegetarian pizza without any apology. She also asked for the meat one without a topping and they told her it was already made so it can't be changed. When the food came out, they just placed it in the middle of the table and left without saying what it was or even putting it in front of the person who ordered. Terrible service just seriously the worst. The food also was mediocre and extremely overpriced. Would NOT be returning ever. Don't go here it is not worth it.",

In my view, it's the best after-work / happy hour bar in Singapore. Friday nights are simply packed. First off, it's got an amazing view of Marina Bay Sands. Second, they play some fun catchy 80s tunes to get the party going (which brings me back to my old stomping grounds in Murray Hill, NYC)! Third, the drinks are relatively cheap, albeit watered down and/or measured, as is most alcoholic drinks in Singapore (ugh!). Fourth, the crowds are good looking expat working professionals (very few, if any, locals to be found).To conclude, I give this place 5-stars for the atmosphere, but more importantly it's the place where I've met so many of my Singaporean based friends, since moving to this country three yrs ago. I liked it so much that I had my 28th birthday party here!",

As other reviewers mentioned, it can get pretty warm, and the mega fans they have don't help that much unless you stand in front of them. Every time I'm there, they seem to play some super weird background videos of people getting tattoos. Anyone else notice that?!

As for the guys, I'm married, but I can say that a lot of them seem like eligible bachelors so if you're in the market for one, this would be a nice place to start!As for the restaurant, I've dined here (drunk) and all I can remember is that the sashimi was good quality, the portions were small, and the price kind of put a dent in our wallet... so maybe next time I'll be smarter and go to McDonald's instead, haha.",

You will have to put an extra effort to hear on what the other person is saying even when he/she is sitting right across you.Not recommending this place as your first date or business meeting venue. Portion-wise the food at this place typically is very tiny. However you could count on that the chef will decorate your meal to make it look very appetizing. Pretty food, pretty view.Last but not least, they do take reservations.",

    "text": "One of my favourite bars to go to in Singapore for a few reasons.Firstly, you get an amazing view from wherever you are seated within the bar, without having to pay extortionate amounts for drinks and be in a pretentious environment. Kinki is pretty casual, which I really like and if you go early evening, you can catch a really good happy hour. (2 for 1) When they don't have a DJ, they have an awesome setlist of old school R&B jams- which I really enjoy as its very hard to get that anywhere else in Singapore and it goes nicely with the funky, urban style setting of the bar.Bar food is great also. A must visit!",

Good quality food and fresh sashimi4. Fusion modern Japanese dishes Cons:1. Unfriendly staff 2. A little bit noisy due to small space3. Overpriced4. Tiny portionBest menu so far:Beef tataki (pan seared sliced beef)Tofu steakSeasonal sanma sashimi with ponzu sauce*I personally wouldn't order sashimi because it's overpriced and nothing special about it at this restaurant. However I think if you do eat meat, beef is always a good choice here. :DI'll be coming back to try other things soon! I'll keep you guys posted!Tip:If you don't wanna break your bank, try not to go for a dinner here when you're really starving.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple of times for lunch with friends. Their set lunches, though not cheap, offer good quality food at reasonable prices. We had the nori crusted spicy salmon for $30 which came with a salad, miso soup, rice and mochi dessert. The salmon was of a generous serving, cooked perfectly moist and tender. The mochi dessert is always the highlight of my meal because it's delightfully chewy and fragrant - I wish they'd provide 2 pieces instead of 1 every time. I do find the price of $5 for tea a tad exorbitant but you're paying for a nice view with a relaxing ambience. It can get crowded at lunch if you're in a big group so make reservations on Chope.",

If you are down with a friend, be sure to order a cocktail each. Their mixes are delicious. I will recommend the Ume Mojito.Be sure also to get the Tai Carpaccio, a platter of thinly sliced Snapper topped with truffle sauce and shio konbu. Ok let's skip the fanciful words and read this: fresh sashimi with flavourful truffle = a clear winner. The Pork Belly with Truffle was melt-in-your-mouth lovely and left a aromatic aftertaste swirling in your mouth with the shaved truffle. Plus, indulge in the Fresh Sashimi Platter (with Maguro, Amaebi, Hotate, Hirame, Hamachi and Sake) which features fresh cuts of plump meat, no scrimping there.A word of advice, be down there when you are feeling ready to spend and order without looking at the price list. Also, be sure to grab seats near the wide windows so you can dine with the view of the city skyline.",

    "text": "Kinki is overpriced, in my opinion. However it's worth checking out if you go for their weekday lunch sets! I got the executive sashimi set for $46. The set came with miso soup, rice, pickles, a fresh salad and a mochi dessert. The strawberry cream mochi wasn't anything great, and the green tea mochi also had a cream and red bean paste within, but I thought the best one was the simple peanut mochi that had no filling.The rice was just normal white rice, so if you want Japanese rice, they charge you more for it. This seems rather outrageous, if you ask me. It's a legitimate japanese restaurant, so they should be serving proper japanese rice! The miso soup was average, salad was very fresh and crisp, but the cream mochi was too creamy so I didn't enjoy it. The sashimi was very fresh though! It was pretty good quality, and there was a wide variety. They have 2 pieces of each type, and one sweet prawn. They even give you 2 pieces of the fatty tuna and scallops, which are pretty premium.The service staff aren't friendly, but they are efficient at filling up your green tea cups and clearing your plates, but they're a miserable looking bunch with nary a smile for anyone.The other saving grace is the view you get overlooking the bay and their chic interior. I really love the strange but interesting light made of black cords and bare light bulbs arranged to look like a chandelier on a low ceiling. Save it for a special lunch date or business lunch meeting, I suppose, but I find that it isn't great value for money here.",
