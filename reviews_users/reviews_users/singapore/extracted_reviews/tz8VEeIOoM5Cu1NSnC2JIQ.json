Nice chicken rice eh? We ordered the steamed chicken rice and it was a quick and helpful service. We got our fills of tender tasty chicken with great condiments of the garlic ginger paste that's a must to add more kick to the flavor. If you are around orchard then this place can be an option for your to go to :)",

And there are some small side dishes but there is nothing for a big bite. Ordered the boiled chicken with rice but had difficulties in picking the sauces to go with chicken. \u00a0So just watched the locals... \u00a0Rice was quite tasty, cooked with chicken soup, but chicken was a bit plain. \u00a0Apparently the place earns a reputation because locals just keep coming.",

The chicken rice stall on the 5th floor of Far East Plaza is a hidden gem ;)Highly popular among locals and people who work around the area, the stall is always full even during non-peak (lunchtime) hours. It is slightly more expensive too since it is in town, but well worth it! I love their roast chicken best which is super tender, and the rice is fragrant but not too oily. Loveeeeeee.",

    "text": "This chicken rice stall has been here for many years and oozes off nostalgia for many's student days. For me, I only started eating here for the past year. I find the rice surprisingly good, coupled with the chili and dark soy sauce. The rice is also non oily which is the kind of chicken rice I like. We ordered a half chicken, with both white and roasted chicken. Encourage no one to do this. They did this on one single plate and the sauce for white chicken kinda ruined the roasted chicken. Best to order separately. White chicken is soft and absorbs the sauce well. However it's not as soft and slippery smooth as Ah Tai's. The chicken itself is comparable to Tian Tian but Tian Tian's rice is still the best. Probably due to location, it's crowded during peak hours and it's slightly more pricey. Certainly not the best to me but a decent chicken rice place you can recommend to your friends.",

It was one of the places my friends and I would end up having our meals after school before proceeding to while away our youth in the shopping complexes in town, doing nothing in particular.This is probably not going to be the tastiest chicken rice but that's exactly what I like about it. The chicken is always tender and doused with a good scoopful of light broth and the rice is always fragrant. You won't get that guilty feeling you often do after a plate of chicken rice elsewhere. The chilli also hits the right spot with a good level of spiciness and taste. Also, don't forget to give the duck soup with salted vegetables a go.I will probably come by at off-peak hours because it tends to get crowded but it also is an experience in itself to drop by at the stall's busiest period. You will probably find yourself huddled around the same table as a couple of strangers, gobbling down your meal - there is definitely a certain charm to that.",

Eveyone keeps talking about the River Valley Chicken Rice.... I don't know - but for me, this is kinda like one of the Best Chicken Rice in Singapore. They are famous for their lunch time queues - so that's why I prefer going during dinner.What I Love: The place is always crowded - but it's worth the wait. The rice is nice and moist. The chicken is yummy, and very tasty. Apart from that, the soup and vegetables are really yummy that it all just goes so well together. I can eat this everyday - but for health reasons, I have this every other month or so.What I Don't Love: Their drink options are pretty basic. But who goes there for the drinks eh? :)",

Couldn't really taste the difference, but my husband preferred the roasted chicken. However, the broth soup you dip the chicken into it was phenomenal. Definitely my favorite during our visit here.Next up, duck soup. My husband heard that this was good, so gave it a go. I had it almost immediately when it we got it and almost burned of my tongue. The flavor itself was alright - it was tomato-y and tart, which I'm not huge on, yet it was warm and comforting to drink the soup. The duck wad alright.Overall, the experience was good and a great catch pricewise. Would consider coming back if we're in the area again.",

Just be prepared to share a table with another group if the restaurant gets crowded.Now for the food! I ordered the steamed (or white) chicken thigh which is served with fragrant rice and a bowl of soup. I also ordered a side of vegetables. What surprised me was that the chicken here was great - jelly like skin (always a good sign), super tender meat and very flavorful sauce. The rice paled in comparison, it was oily but didn't have much of the fragrance you'd expect. The vegetables were alright, a little on the salty side but nothing to write home about. I'd come back to have that chicken again, and maybe try the roast chicken.Lastly, it's a mom and pop shop so cash is king. That'd be the case for almost every small eatery in Singapore but just thought I'd point it out for the many tourists who visit the area. It's kinda expensive for what you get but it's also in the Orchard Road area so I should adjust my expectations.",

Other than that, everything else was normal, nothing special about it. While sitting near the counter, I saw many articles raving about this place but after finishing my meal, I wonder to myself. You have to be kidding, right? But I won't ruled this place out for my future chicken rice meals. Perhaps, will drop by again to give it another try. \u00a0Best is not to come during meal times as it is often crowded and the queue can be quite long .

    "text": "Ate here the previous night after watching Star Wars: The Force Awakens (aww yea)With 3 male friends, the 4 of us ordered a full \"white\" chicken ($36) and a plate of vegetables. I'm not sure about the individual cost of each plate of rice and the vegetables but it was $40+ in total. Seems relatively pricey but for a shop in expensive town area the value is decent. And yes, we were all pretty full after our meal, so you can judge the proportions for your next meal.The meat is soft and tender, and generally deboned - although there were some portions with bones, but they weren't a huge hassle to eat. Rice is fragrant and soup is not entirely plain (there's the taste of chicken bones and other ingredients). Not a bad place though, but for the price I rather go somewhere else (yes I'm stingy). Nonetheless if you find yourself in town and would like a relatively more budget meal without cutting down on quality this is a good place.",

A nice place to go for comfort food; tender chicken on top of fragrant rice that goes perfectly well with their home made ginger and chilli sauces. Their salted vegetable duck soup is my favourite! \u00a0Never fails to warm your tummy and tickles your taste bud.",

You have the option of getting steamed or roasted, but steamed is traditional, so that's what we went with. \u00a0 So good I could've easily eaten there many more times, and I will again on my next trip back.",
