Upon entering, you'll be given a card where you take with you to order food from many stations. You will be charged on this card where at the end, you bring to the cashier to be rung up. You pay your food at the end. Stations include an ice cream, crepe, and juice bar. There's a seafood, pasta, and meat station. Plenty of seating and in an cooled area. The AC is not blasted on high, but just enough to keep you comfortable. Everything is made to order, so that's great and you can be assured that your food has not been sitting under a heat lamp. Must go and a great place to get all of your western style cravings.",

    "text": "Came here on New Year's Eve (2016) and as expected, long lines were formed outside the restaurant.While queuing, one of the staffs asked the crowd (including my friend and I) whether there was a party of two. My friend spotted it pretty quickly and hence we jumped the queue and was given the seat near to the kids' playground (slide).This restaurant do not have much seats available so you might have to wait till other patrons to be done with their food. Compared to the one in Somerset 313, it was narrower. There were plenty of choices (salad bar, crepes, pasta, rosti, dessert, beverages, etc). Upon going into the restaurant, you will be given a card that will be used to swipe the food or beverages you choose from the different sections and pay when you are about to exit the restaurant. The good part about this concept is that the crowds will not walk in and walk out from the same set of doors.I was craving for crepes and hence decided to go for pulled beef with pumpkin sauce. There was a line at that section but I was able to retrieve my order fast. My friend ordered the Smoked Salmon Rosti and it came out much later as there were longer lines formed there.Food wise, I love the crispy crepes and the ingredients were of perfect blend. The beef was chewy and juicy just like I wanted it to be. The portion was more than I expected. For the Smoked Salmon Rosti, it was my first time trying. Love the combinations of the salmon and the rosti. The crisp blended well with the slimy salmon slices. Would probably prefer it to be more smoked salmon slices on this dish.My friend decided to get sweet crepe for dessert. She chose banana chocolate crepe topped with rum ice cream. The banana were generous and the chocolate was not too sweet. This dish was not too sweet as I thought it will be by its look. Overall, this family friendly restaurant has tons to offer. From the indoor decoration to creating a space for the children so that the adults can chit chat. Price wise it is costly but I would not mind to spend a little more once in a while for good food :)",

If you don't want to queue a tleast 20 minutes on a thursday night at 7pm, make a reservation.There are lots of tables, some are bar top, and some are booths and some are just typical tables which you can join together to accomodate a big group.1. Watermelon JuiceThe watermelon juice tasted okay, nothing special. I would rather go elsewhere to get this watermelon juice.The rosti station had one of the longest queues!You can pick to have your rosti with sausages, smoked salmon and more.With so many potatoes placed here to decorate the stall, I wonder how much potatoes do they use on a daily basis.2. Rosti with Smoked Salmon $16.90+I loved how generous they were with the smoked salmon, covered the entire plate of rosti! The smoked salmon wasn't too salty, it was perfect and the rosti was crispy on the top layers and soft and warmed to perfection in the center. This was exactly how I remembered it 10 years ago. It seems quality standards remained the same over the past decade! *applause*3. Rosti with SausagesI picked both the chicken cheese sauage and the pork garlic sausage. The chicken cheese sausage was very juicy and flavourful. The pork garlic sausage (the shorter one) was a bit more dry and slightly harder to cut into. The sour cream added more flavour to the sausages.While waiting for my Rosti to be cooked, I watched this chef twirl and spin the pizza dough in the air, it was quite amazing and it made me want to try the pizza.4. Onion Chicken PizzaThe pizza looked fine, till we cut it up and saw the amount of oil in it. The onion was more for decoration as it seemed pretty raw. The chicken cubes were tiny and the cheese wasn't sufficient enough. The outside crust was crispy but the inner pizza was dough and pretty much all the ingredient slid right off the pizza. Very disappointing.5. PastaCheesy goodness and even the brocolli tasted awesome. A decent plate of pasta with simple flavours from the ham and brocolli6. Roasted Half Chicken with SausagesThe chicken was very tender and juicy, even the breast meat was juicy. The sausages here were the same as the ones that came with the smoked salmon.7. SaladThe salad seemed fresh, however there wasn't sufficient dressing on the salad. All in all, there were some hits and misses, and Yes I will go back for more rosti goodness, but I was surprised to see the bill of $140 for 4 pax. Is the food fresh? Yes sort of, I mean I can't say it's super fresh, but I know I didn't get sick from eating it. But the price just doesn't justify the quality of food we received.",

They are also daddy-friendly, with a selection of beers and desserts.I've moved on from the cheap and good old rosti, and now go for the salads and seafood paella, which comes with enough chicken to share with my toddlers.(I spent $97.70 for 4 adults and 2 toddlers.)",

Having said that, the pork knuckle tasted fine in that the meat is not too salty and the skin is crispy. The problem is that the skin looked burnt and not very much appetizing. The ambience is good. I came at 6.30pm and there were plenty of seats. It's now 7pm and this place is packed. Suggest to arrive early to pick the best seats.",

The problem of sorts is that there are so many options that I can go twice in one day and have very different meals.The soups are good and seem to be made by hand with fresh ingredients. The fish seems extremely fresh. The rosti enables me to eat what is essentially a cake of french fries and not feel as bad about it because it is so fresh, and the raclette is divine. German sausage also goes well with it. My fiance loves the paella. The savory crepes have a little too much cheese but are good. The salads are wonderful except for the flies that usually surround the lettuce. The only thing I would definitely never have again here is the pasta, which comes in a watery soup-like tomato-flavoured liquid with awkward cubes of vegetable.The sweet crepes with mascarpone taste lighter than they probably are. I didn't like the plum dessert because it tastes like it is just plums cooked in a pie crust full of egg. The lemon meringue pie is so so so good. They are owned by or somehow affiliated with Moevenpick, which means they also have a case full of some of the best ice cream in the world, imported from Switzerland.Although revealing this holds a risk of making the lines even longer at checkout, one of the main draws of this place is that they discount about three items to $10-$13 each day for lunch, with a free drink. So it is kind of like they are encouraging variety.",

The restaurant is located on the roof top of vivo city and they had tall glass windows all around so the possibility of it becoming a green house was high but they managed to keep the place nice and cool so that's a plus for sure in the hot and humid Singapore. another plus was that we quickly found the dessert station as it was less than 5 meters from the entrance. i was hoping to get ice cream with my waffle but it was a whooping $6 for a scoop on top of the almost $10 waffle with fruits option. i was happy to forgo the extra sugar and focus on \u00a0the natural mango that was fresh and juicy! the waffle was nice and crisp since it was made upon order. the lady at the station was super friendly and very generous with the toppings. thanks to her i had a satisfying meal and a pleasant time at the restaurant.the only reason i gave it 3 stars and not more is because of the price. i guess with so many cafes in Singapore serving more outstanding and more delicious waffles, their pricing seemed steep in comparison. if i do go back to Marche, it wouldn't be for their desserts but more likely for their other items on the menu.",

If this is your first time trying this restaurant, here are some of my must-try and must-not-try dishes !Food1. Salad bar- pretty expensive for a small bowl of salad, there are a great variety of vegetables to choose from and most of them are pretty fresh ! Rating- don't bother ordering if you wish to fill your stomach with better food. 3/52. Pasta - marche uses fresh ingredients and their pasta are cooked to near perfection. Rating- worth trying. 4/53. Meat- in my opinion, they serve the best pork knuckle in town. You definitely have to try if you are coming in groups of 4 or more. Avoid ordering the steak as they usually cook in batches which ends up overcooking the steaks. Rating- definite must try for the pork knuckle 5/54. Savoury crepe- unique dish that you cannot really find on other places. However, the portion os pretty big and will be better if shared. Rating- recommended 4.5/55. Rosti- the signature dish of the restaurant. There will always be a long queue during peak hours. However, the potato is cooked to perfection ! They use good quality oil and the portion is just nice for one person. Rating- 4.5/5 6. Pizza/rice- only tried once for each dish. Pizza gives lots of toppings and the serving is huge ! The rice is pretty ordinary. Rating-3.5/57. Seafood - calamari rings are nothing special and do not taste that different from outside. Quite overpriced. Rating- 2.5/5Drinks1. Fruit juice- i do not recommend buying their fruit juice. They will pre-squeeze the drinks in the afternoon and leave it for the rest of the day. Hence they are not really fresh. They charge pretty high for the drinks too. Rating- 2.5/52. Fruit teas - has always been my preferred choice of drink over the years. They serve different selection where you can try before ordering. Rating -4/53. Beer/non-alcoholic drink- they serve a wide selection of non-alcoholic drinks and their beer/wine are also quite unique. Rating-3.5/5Deserts1. Cakes and tarts- they have a wide selection of pastries to choose from and most of them taste really good ! However you will be usually too full to eat more than a slice after meals. Rating- 4/52. Crepes/waffles- my favourite desert is the crepe of the week. No other restaurants have this uniqe dish. However the taste usually varies with the pastry chef. There are days when the crepe taste heavenly and days when it taste like soggy prata. I would recommend getting this crepe in somerset for better quality. Rating- 4/5",

As other reviewers have pointed out, you are given a card upon entering and you're free to use it as many times as you want at each station. Just don't get carried away with it or else you could be handing over your life savings and you wouldn't even know it. Haha. The food was pretty tasty but to be honest, the one thing that really stood out to me was the seafood paella. I could not stop eating it and really felt like getting seconds. Except there were other food to be devoured. My friend had other dishes and we shared the wealth at our tiny table for two. The only thing that I did not like was that it was rather cramped. I could literally hear the conversation of the table next to us, and holding hot plates of food while avoiding the crowd isn't safe. But I know I'll be coming back here if I ever visit Singapore again. Better yet, Marche, why don't you bring this chain to the States?",

    "text": "I can't decide if I like this Marche or the one at 313 Somerset the most. I find that both Marches make you 'get lost in time'. You can really take your own sweet time to dine and catch up with friends over food, without worrying you'll be chased out. What's more, it's got a nice and warm environment. Marche at VivoCity is kind of on its own at the third floor; so you have to walk out from the food court side to reach the restaurant. The usual thing I like about Marche is the nice variety of food, and considerably affordable prices. Also, what you see is what you pay, since there is no additional ++. Thumb up for a like!",
