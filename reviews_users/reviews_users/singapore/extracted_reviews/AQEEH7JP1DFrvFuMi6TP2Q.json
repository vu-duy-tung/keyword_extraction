    "text": "Skyve Wine Bistro is a hidden gem quietly tucked away in the old monk's hill secondary school. Ambience wise, pretty chill and quite cosy especially on a weekday night when it's not too crowded. In terms of food, I was pleasantly surprised (didn't have my hopes too high after I seeing its 3.5 star rating on yelp :P). Almost all their mains are prepared using the sous-vide method of cooking.We started off with two sides to share - luncheon chips and truffle fries. These were served in bamboo dim sum baskets. I would give both a miss next time. The luncheon chips were too dry and the truffle fries were meh at best. For our mains, we had the duck confit, Duroc pork rack, and Kalbi beef short ribs. The meats were all very tender and flavorful. The Kalbi beef short ribs are a little spicy and jam packed with flavor from the marinade - perhaps a little overpowering but typical of kalbi dishes. The duck confit was well done though nothing too distinct from other duck confit dishes you can get elsewhere. Portion sizes are generous. The 3 of us left sufficiently full and satisfied and had no space for dessert! We had a bottle of white wine, not much choice (I think 3 varieties each for white and red?) but ok - priced. Overall, I would still give this place a 4 given the decent service, quaint setting and decent standard of food.",

    "text": "I'm surprised how underwhelmed I was, but maybe that should be expected since I had high expectations of the restaurant. I was considering this place for my wedding reception, and since it had such rave reviews online I expected to be really wowed.I met my good friends who were really kind to notify the staff it was a celebration of my birthday (Thanks lovelies!). When I arrived, I saw a customized note with the staffs' signatures giving their best wishes for my birthday. Although I wasn't peeved, I agreed with my friends that it was weird the note was just left on the table, instead of brought around after my friends had arrived.The menu was filled with items I was really excited about, sadly, the execution did not live up to the expectations. We tried a load of dishes:luncheon chips: strangely, although the most appetizer like item, arrived last on the table. Love the idea, but was way to salty I could only have a handful of themscallops: needs more sear on the top, and the insides were really raw..oysters au naturel: all the server knew was that they were from Canada. When asked whether the oysters were briney or sweet, she had no idea what I was talking about.duck confit: nice tender meat, skin was crispy enough. good but not great execution. the sweet potato was too sweet and rich.sou vides egg spaghettini: i loved it! this was truly the best dish - rich and creamy, with truffle sauce on the pasta. Iberico ham was much appreciatedBeef tartare: it was an average tartare. was rather puzzled by the condiments by the tartare, which were not explained by the serverThe meal ended with a wonderful tiny cake and candle from Skyve. Great decorations with my name written on it! I'm largely conflicted whether to give service a 3 or a 5. The server we had appeared rather inattentive and inexperienced.. but the birthday bonus was really thoughtful of the restaurant.Also, despite the general classy decor of the restaurant, the fans looked really cheap.. And it is located in an old school like building.. very weird! I was very puzzled, because there were actual school kids loitering at the gates of the building.. Overall, I'm not sure I really would choose this place for my wedding reception. Considering that prices are really high, and that the only a small portion of the food hit the spot.. I might come back for appetizer, but I'm not really sure since it is a rather inconvenient location.",

    "text": "Sous vide is the focus at Skyve Wine Bistro, as it was at Table 66. With the larger kitchen, Chef Vincent has taken the sous vide technique to a higher level and practically every item was done this way for their updated menu. If i were to give a description of the 64 deg Sous Vide Egg & Spaghettini ($18) on the menu, it would be 'The starter that you will NEVER wanna share\". I'm just a little disappointed that they only serve this for dinner! Soft poached egg, spaghettini in truffle salsa, iberico ham, truffle hollandaise.. this is perfect breakfast food hello! The truffle taste was pretty strong on aroma but the taste was bland. However, if you mix the whole lot together, the saltiness of the Iberico ham will help to overcome that. Still.. this is my favorite dish.When i first heard that we were gonna do a tempura of beef tongue, i was puzzled. Like seriously? Beef tongue? With all its chewiness? But that's the great thing about sous vide and its ability to break down all that sinew and proteins and that's how the beef tongue became.. Tofu. The other half of Tongue in Cheeks ($36) is a 6 hours sous vide wagyu beef cheeks that is soooo well done (not in the overcooked sense) it melts. Lovely lovely dish.Now what i like better than the beef and fish was the Lamb Rack ($40), a lovely grilled marinated lamb rack served with a light curry spiced roasted pumpkin (da luuurve). The sauce is a little sweet and sour a la Korean style when eaten on its own. However, when accompanied with the mango and mint chutney, the dish took on a Mediterranean taste. Surprise surprise.Desserts were pretty stellar. The Mango & Cheese Semifreddo ($12) wasn't the least heavy/gelat because of the frozen lime foam that tasted like a zingy yogurt. I'm glad that Chef Vincent shares my love for buttery and crumbly pastries because the sablee cookies that he insists on making himself were fabulous.Skyve gave the typical Tiramisu ($12) a twist with this open presentation. The ladyfingers were soaked in STRONG coffee liqueur, piled with whipped and light mascarpone cream and icy kahlua granita. More crunchy cookie bits to give it more texture. So yea.. Skyve is definitely my chill out place from now. It's great for a lazy brunch (which i will post up on the blog soon), a fun dinner with the girls or even for drinks with the pals. I do love the alfresco area on a breezy night. Live music also available every Wed and Friday. Now let's go skyving. ;)",

    "text": "This is definitely a hidden gem in residential Newton. It's located on a one-way street next to a school and in a random complex with an eclectic mix of tenants. I would say it's a 7-10 minute leisurely walk from the Newton MRT station. Once you reach the complex just ask the guard where Skyve is or look for the signs (they're here and there.) Walking in, it may seem a bit \"atas\", but I've felt that brunch has been pretty casual and the staff quite welcoming the both times I've been.*I've had the pleasure of having their weekend \"Snoozy Brunch\", trying 2 breakfast items on the sweet side. The ricotta hot cakes are fluffy and I love the passion fruit butter that it comes with. Recently, I tried the Banana Nut French Toast, which I found satisfying as well. It was the perfect amount of sweetness, and although I like my french toast drenched in syrup, the small ladle of syrup served on the side proved to be sufficient.Miguel has seemed to go the savoury route twice. He's tried the Truffle Scramble, and although I only tasted the fluffy eggs, I can say that it is quite truffle-y. :)To prove their wine bistro realness, they feature 2 bottles of wine each month. At $45++ per bottle, I think it's a pretty good deal in alcohol tax-heavy SG! Considering I've enjoyed brunch twice, I'd love to return sometime for dinner to see what it entails.--*You can bring kids here for brunch, but I'd leave 'em at home for dinner.",

    "text": "Skyve Wine Bistro previous known as Skyve Elementary Bistro serves modern European cuisine, using sous vide in most of its cooking. Whether it is cooking of meat (poulet, lamb, beef, pork or duck) or vegetables, sous vide is used. Sous vide is a cooking technique in which food is cooked in airtight plastic bag in a water bath. The water path is kept at a constant temperature, normally lower than what is required for cooking. Normally, the food needs to be cooked in the water bath for a longer period of time, sometimes as long as 72 hours. This cooking technique ensures that the food are cooked evenly, the nutrients are not lost and resulting in a juicer end product, retaining the natural flavours. Skyve Wine Bistro located at Winstedt Road in the old Monks Hill Secondary School compound is 10 minutes walk from Newton MRT station.The restaurant has an extensive list of more than 70 labels of wine in its wine cellarThe restaurant has both alfresco and indoor dining. For indoors dining, the restaurant is split into lounge section and a main dining section. The lounge section had retro style chairs, sofa and tables. An ideal place for chilling out in a causal and cozy setting. There will be a live band performing at this section every Wednesday and Friday night. As for the main dining area, that is where the proper chairs and tables are, for more formal occasions.The meal started off with The Sleeping Oysters: Mentaiyaki, Chilean, Kilpatrick ($34 for half a dozen) and several appetisers. The Mentaiyaki Oyster with metaiko, ebiko, lemon juice and aioli. The Chilean Oyster with serrano, lime juice, red wine vinegar and cilantro (also known as coriander). The Kilpatrick Oyster with bacon, worchestershire and chives.What I like about the oysters was that they were fresh, soft, plump and juicy. My favorite was the Japanese inspired Mentaiyaki Oyster. The British inspired Kilpatrick Oyster on the other hand was not my cup of tea. The hardness of the bacon did complement the soft oyster. In addition, the intense flavour of the ingredients used overwhelmed the other flavours. The Petuna and Ume Somen $20, seared petuna with ebiko, mango, chilli, sesame yuzu dressing, cold somen and mesclun was very well executed. This appetiser could be easily mistaken as a main course. The petuna stole the show in this dish. I nearly when 'wow' as I ate this. Underneath the crisp top, the pentuna was incredibly succulent with its natural flavour fully retained in the flesh. It was very fresh with no fishy taste. The ebiko gave a nice crunch to the Ume Somen.The Skyve Beef Tartare $22 was an interesting dish. The beef tartare (minced raw beef) was seared on the outside leaving the interior entirely raw. It was then served with truffle egg yolk and cilantro dust on top with flat bread, ancho chilli aioli and thyme sea salt at the side. Customers who ordered this dish would need to thoroughly mix the beef tartare with the truffle egg yolk and cilantro dust. It was like making mashed potato (if unsure, you can ask the staff to do this for you). After that, scoop some of it onto the flat bread and add the other sides in according to your preference. For those who do not like raw beef, you may still like this as it had a mixture of flavours; distinct truffle aroma along with a little spiciness and saltiness in one mouthful.Detailed review: foodiefc.blogspot.sg/201\u2026",

    "text": "Skyve Elementary Bistro and Bar sits in a old school surroundings at Winstedt Road, a small road near Newton Circus. It is also located in the former Monk's Hill Secondary School. The easiest way to get there is via the MRT, and alight at Newton.I was quite lost while trying to find my way there. Call them up if you find yourself lost in the vicinity. Food there is really good and I absolutely love the dessert, the poached pear clafouti, part of their communal dining experience. I'll recommend the white meat, more than the red meat (beef) as it is tender, juicy and really delicious!In the evening, why not sit outside and enjoy the breeze instead of the normal air-conditioned dining restaurant. Chatting with friends till late, drinking and enjoying the company of one another, Skyve is a good place to be at.A little pricey for their food, but its a place where you can consider going during special occasions or sort.",

    "text": "This is a good place to go if you're hunting for some weekend brunch. And hunt you must! For the location is frustratingly difficult to find for first-timers. You'll have to walk quite a bit if you take the public bus, and if you drive, you'll have to keep a keen eye out for the right turn-in. Miss the turn-in, and you'll have to suffer another long-ish drive with two U-turns!Once I managed to find the place, I was impressed by its decor and ambience. Lots of natural light pouring through its glass walls, and interesting furniture.No complaints about the food at all. I had the Skyver's Breakfast (S$20), and while the poached eggs were not the best I've had, they're tasty nonetheless. The bread was nicely toasted, and everything else fresh.In general, prices are fairly reasonable.",

    "text": "I am usually cautiously optimistic when it comes to new restaurants. \u00a0Prior to going there tonight, I hadn't heard a thing about Skyve, so I had zero expectations. \u00a0Fortunately, my dining experience was a pleasant (albeit expensive) surprise. \u00a0The final bill came up to $190 for 2 of us (no alcohol) which I guess is somewhat steep given that Newton circus fishball soup is down the road for $4. \u00a0 \u00a0Given it's random location, getting to the restaurant can be challenging if you don't know where you need to go (it felt like we were parking in some old industrial estate then wondering lost through an HDB estate), but once you get through to it, the restaurant glistens like a glass jewel box in the lush forest. \u00a0The staff welcome is warm and it is obvious that the management put in serious effort into creating a chic dining ambience. \u00a0I really liked how comfortable it felt to sit in the lounge area with its banquettes and cool rocking chairs (nice touch) We ordered 1 appetizer, 2 mains & 2 desserts, most of which were delicious (don't order the Grilled whole lobster, way too expensive for what we got! The noodles were limp, somewhat bland, just not spectacular for $60). \u00a0Memorable dishes: 1. Sous-vide spring chicken with creamed corn and broccolini- DELICIOUS. \u00a0I loved the tender chicken meat with its flavorful browned skin. It came with sauce on the side which I gladly mopped up with my poultry2. Ivory dome dessert: Mango and marscarpone, passionfruit jelly, dark chocolate sponge, mango & lime salad. \u00a0I never thought of melding chocolate with the citrus jelly, but the combination was surprisingly light (wish there was more crunch at the bottom though!) 3. \u00a0We heard from others that the duck confit is amazing (and the person next to us ordered it) so I'm looking forward to trying that next time. \u00a0Other positives: - We appreciated the helpful explanations of foreign culinary terms at the bottom of every menu page. \u00a0No point being 'atas' if no one will understand the fancy french words! \u00a0- Attentive service (the waitress was ALWAYS there to pour us water, remove plates etc) BOTTOM LINE: Really cute place for a romantic Friday/Saturday night date (they have great singers playing live music on Fridays). \u00a0Given the impressive quality of the food, presentation and dining room ambience, I would actually pay money to go back and try their other menu items. \u00a0And for a first visit, that in itself deserves a toast. \u00a0Visit my website for other reviews: thefearlessdiner.wordpre\u2026",

    "text": "best pancakes I've had in singapore - and I've had many - and otherwise decent brunch food at this hard-to-find cafe near newton circus. that first part of the sentence needs to be put into context: I'm still waiting for the likes of IHOP to open in singapore, and have since given up on having proper flapjacks - but these ones are pretty darn good, though a rather fancy ricotta version. I take brunch very seriously - you should, too - and this place does it well. a large open space with lots of sunlight from the floor-to-ceiling windows, just the right hum from boisterous kids and brunching ladies - reasonably priced and portioned - if only it were a little more public-transport friendly.we started off with the sous vide eggs benedict, plopped atop an english muffin and plate laden with bacon, mushrooms and sweet corn kernels. I'm not really sure what the sous-viding does for poached eggs - feels a little gimmicky, and in any case, aren't traditionally cooked poached eggs already meant to be soft and yielding inside? but it made for a decent - and rather large spread - and I liked the mushrooms and corn (which you don't often get with your bennie). our pancakes arrived midway - seemed a little miserly with two almomd-flake-sprinkled circles alongside sliced bananas and a tiny ramekin of syrup - like a revelation. these were fluffy, but densely substantial - with brown griddled sides and a lovely richness from the cheese - meshed well with the syrup. so simple - and really good. we finished with the bowl of granola, the weakest dish by far - let down by unexceptional ingredients. there was a good portion of tender dried apricots and fresh strawberry pieces strewn throughout, but the granola was too-sweet \u00a0and worst, the yogurt was the sweetened watery fake-vanilla sort! the sort you have as kids and then realise when eating it as adults that it's a bare fascimile of what yogurt could and should be, and is more pudding-like than anything. it's a beautiful space - the sort you imagine ladies-who-lunch would love, and all that light streaming in is lovely at brunchtime. there's a mild sense of chaos in there - but the good sort, from kids running about and being noisy - but it adds to the enjoyment. mostly good food (unless we got very lucky), and good portions at reasonable prices - those ricotta pancakes are particularly worthy of investigation.",

    "text": "Brunch is perfect for lazy sleepyheads, even better if that place serves all day breakfast. My numero uno for brunch is Wild Honey, but we left it till too late to make a reservation even on the ever dependable Chope, so we had to make do with another place instead. Skyve came highly recommended by foodie friends, so we decided to check it out.And boy did I wish we hadn't.Food : The eggs Benedict was unimpressive, and the rosti overly salty and dry. The smoked salmon too, tasted overly salty and had a somewhat slimy taste to it. The pizza was an utter cardboard let down, leading to a friend to comment that she had had better pizza in the airport in Italy. The ricotta hotcakes were passable, but as we were expecting larger portions generally served at other brunch establishments, we were disappointed by its showing. The beef tartare was decent but nothing to write home about.Ambience : It actually is a pretty space with lots of natural light, but as it was pouring on the day we went, the beauty was slightly marred.Service : This was the worst bit of the entire dining experience. To begin with, our coffees took forever to arrive. When they finally did, they were barely lukewarm. The carafe of apple juice we ordered at the beginning never arrived despite several reminders, and towards the end we were informed they only served that particular juice was only served in glasses and not carafes, although otherwise indicated in the menu. I ordered rosti with a side of eggs Benedict, but was informed 15 minutes later they had run out of rosti. I then asked for an order of the regular eggs Benedict. Half an hour later, they claimed to have found a portion of rosti, but had run out of eggs Benedict. For BRUNCH. On top of everything, we had to remind the wait staff for every single order.Honestly guys, get your s*** together.",

We ordered two cappuccinos, the truffled egg scramble, and the French toast. Everything arrived to the table at a reasonable time and both meals were delicious. We stayed a bit afterwards since the ambiance was quite pleasant and flipped through a magazine while we finished our coffee. The service was reliable and friendly. We will definitely return.",

    "text": "Tucked away at the old Monk's Hill secondary school, Skyve is the perfectly place for what else, skiving on the job! Its quiet and peaceful surroundings make it perfect for conducting meetings or having a slow cup of coffee to pass the day undisturbed. The crowd begins to pick up closer to dinner time. The interior is beautifully done up, with an open wine cellar displaying the wines on offer. Bathrooms are unisex, so that can be a little bit embarrassing. The food and coffee are decently priced and taste really good. So far, we've tried most of the pizzas and breakfast sets. The only drawback is the al fresco seating, as there's no shelter and when it rained, as it did on our last visit, things got really wet very fast. Parking is relatively easy as you can park right outside Skyve and enter from the rear entrance, saving on a relatively pricey parking in the compound.",
