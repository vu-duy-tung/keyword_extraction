The flavor was perfect and there was plenty of lobster pieces to eat along the way. Next I had the beef casserole with mash. Very tasty and filling. By now I am full but with a cheese trolley full of different types I've never tried before, I couldn't resist. I got 5 cheeses.I could barely move. Such a great meal with good atmosphere. Recommended for people wanting traditional French food.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Taratata for awhile, as the menu looked promising. \u00a0It's classic French, and the restaurant enjoys a prime location on Keong Saik Road. \u00a0And inside, it looks like a classic bistro. \u00a0Stopped by for lunch earlier, and while the menu looked good, the execution was not as good. \u00a0I started off with French Onion soup which was ok, but the portion was quite small. \u00a0The main was a pork chop, but it was underseasoned, and the presentation was very underwhelming (see my photo). \u00a0And while they had a decent wine list, charging $30 for the cheapest red wine by the glass seems a bit too much, even in Singapore. \u00a0So overall, while the ambiance and menu hits the mark, the execution does not. \u00a0And with wine prices among the highest that I have encountered in Singapore, the price-value ratio isn't there either.",

    "text": "Dining out is an experience that involves many senses. You want to TASTE and SMELL the good food. The service matters too- is the waitress being attentive or is the waitress ignoring you? The atmosphere matters a lot too. Is the restaurant dirty, are there flies trying to attack your food? Is the music too loud so you have to scream?Well, Taratata Bistrot is a cute French restaurant that serves excellent French food. Unfortunately, the staff was incapable of controlling their overly loud and possibly drunk customers. The 4 course set meal was $70++ per person, on top of that, we ordered wine which was over $100. We came here to enjoy a nice delicious meal but the large table behind was a nightmare. A few women in particular kept cackling at the top of their voice like witches. This is a nice restaurant, this is not a circus. If you want to be loud and obnoxious, go to the hawker center. We complained to one of the waitresses but she seemed too afraid to tell the next table to tone it down. We then told another waitress and she just smiled, as if she didn't understand us. Finally, we got so annoyed that we left. We told them we were leaving because of the noise and they still did nothing. I am going to talk about the food briefly, it is pity that the food was delicious yet we were not able to enjoy it. The cod was good. The cheese platter for desert was excellent- you get to choose your cheese from a cheese cart, which they do in France. The problem is that it was hard to hear the explanations about the different cheeses because of the obnoxious table next door. Bottom line: the waiters and waitresses should not be afraid to tell customers to be more considerate. If these customers are really drunk, do not be afraid to refuse to serve alcohol to them. (I am not sure if our table was drunk or not, but it is a possibility. Either way they were extremely loud.) It is a small restaurant, one loud table is enough to ruin the experience for everyone else. Either way I am not coming back. Just only because I don't spend over $130 per person on a meal but feel like I am in a hawker center.",

Wine list decent, reasonable prices and OK selection, but nothing really too interesting. Overall, this was a 3-star experience, but I'm deducting a star because one of the servers kept messaging my personal number after the meal, it was really creepy!",

    "text": "Taratata Bistrot is a charming little French restaurant along Keong Saik Road which I've been meaning to try for sometime. I finally made time for it when i saw that it was on the Restaurant Week listing (yes i'm slow in updating) and it was only $25 for a 3 course meal. The prices are very reasonable even if you didn't make the RW bookings though. We were served starters from their regular menu, which is a good thing i feel. I hate it when restaurants serve a completely different (usually substandard) menu for RW. That kinda deters repeat visits especially if the food sucks.The Half Dozen of Snails Baked in Herbed Garlic Butter ($25). I found the escargots to be succulent and well flavored with garlic herbs. The Baked Eggs Casserole with Duck Gizzard Confit and Mushrooms ($24) had nice runny eggs that are best soaked up with the delicious baguette Taratata serves. Generous pieces of foie gras were swimming in the eggs but i thought they would be better seared first before thrown into the ramekin.Even though the mains were not from the regular menu, we were very happy with our dishes. The Salmon Coulibiac with Watercress Butter Sauce was lovely! The puff pastry was buttery and flaky and the salmon was cooked to a nice pink. The Pan Roasted Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin with Mustard sauce was done simply to allow diners a taste of the tender and non fatty meat. It's the first time i thought that pork could taste so clean and healthy. K thought it was a little too bland though.Dessert was the highlight of the meal! The Baked Chocolate Tart with Crisp, Caramel sauce and Ginger bread ice cream was out of this world. The crunchy tart held the intense chocolate lava and the pastry skin twirl made us twirly whirly in our seats as we devoured the dish without speaking (but we did make a lot of oooohs and aaaahhhhs. God they need to put this on their menu.Service was attentive and quick, maybe because they wanted us out fast for their second lunch service. If you're up for some quick lunch, Taratata Bistrot does a 40 minutes Lunch Express at $25 which includes a soup and a main course. For a more leisurely lunch, there's the $30 2-course set lunch and they also serve a 3 course set meal for $38. I'd recommend Taratata Bistrot for a charming and affordable French meal.",

    "text": "I've been on the lookout for good french food in Singapore and this place turns out to be that little gem where you can make a reservation relatively last-minute (about an hour before) and still get a seat for Friday evening dinner. And the food and wine are both good and at a \"reasonable\" price point (well, relative to the likes of famous French fine dining establishments like Les Amis and Gunther's).As a starting point, we took their wine recommendation, a Fort Duroc 2007 Medoc Vieilles Vigne (thanks Vivino!). Most of their wines are in the low 90s to $200++ range and their special was going at $108 a bottle. The \"house wine\" turned out to be quite complex and delicious, and given that this was at the lower end of their prices for wine, not what I'd expected them to push. A good start already!We had escargot for starters - suffice to say, the other reviews on this page have it spot on. Excellent, excellent dish.The highlight of the night had to be my main - duck confit French style ($33). Duck confit is not an easy dish to do well, based on restaurant experiences in Singapore. Typically the duck meat gets too dry or the skin is too soggy. I'm happy to share that they did this dish perfectly - the meat was moist, succulent and tender but the skin perfectly crispy and hot. Easily the best duck confit I've had in Singapore!Despite a slight hiccup in food service (our other order for main came 20 minutes late), the servers were at their best attending to us to make sure that we could share the duck confit (while we waited), and also gave us complimentary sorbet at the end of the night to make up for their mistakes. Like most good French places in Singapore, this place is not cheap (but not quite out of the stratosphere expensive). That said, good food, good wine and good service - I'm definitely coming back!",

    "text": "It was a great experience even though we skipped the mains and had 3 appetisers plus four desserts. French Onion SoupThis was done exactly the way I wanted it to be. Cheesy toast which was soaked in the savoury goodness. There was also some cheese crust that stuck stubbornly to the edges around the exterior pot that you should not waste. just use your hands to pluck them into your mouth. Once you dig in, there seemed to be endless amount of soft onions Escargots in herbed garlic and butterEscargots lovers must not miss this dish and it's recommended that you go for the dozen on the ala carte menu if you find that the 6 little ones on the sunday set menu insufficient to satisfy your craving. Crab and Pomelo SaladThis might not be commonly seen on French menu but it's certainly a refreshing starter to have. The crab meat hidden by the greens were fresh, sweet and creamy. Reminds me of a dense coleslaw without the vegetables. The pomelo was bitter but matched well with the crab. These 3 dishes were followed shortly by 4 desserts, which were mostly accompanied with a pot of creme anglaise. Prune Clafoutis with Rum and Raisin Ice creamThis was unexpectedly good as this French dessert is usually served at home for in large servings. This individual tart-like Clafoutis had a chewy texture and is very sweet. The prunes as well as the ice cream emit strong hints of rhum. Worth a try since it's not common in local French menus. Creme Brulee This is relatively large but I like generous portions of desserts since it is difficult to be satisfied with morsels of good things.A fairly decent brulee for the price. Grand Marnier SouffleThis mighty souffle rises to a level which is one the highest I have seen so far. The alcohol kick was satisfying but somehow I still miss a chocolate souffle. The sweet cream is really good because one can control the sweetness of the dessert. I recommend pouring everything in as it would taste quite eggy and plain on its own. Warm Chocolate Cake with Lavender Ice CreamThis molten cake is once again larger than the usual ones. The gooey inner filling oozes out as expected but it would be better if the outer cake wall was thinner. Otherwise there would be no more molten lava to go with the dry parts. Nonetheless, the lavender ice cream and creme anglaise did set this dish a little different from the rest. The lavender ice cream was particularly unique pairing and I appreciate it more than a vanilla scoop. The scent of lavender was quite strong which some might not be used to. Overall, the French meal here was a comfortable and cosy one without the occasion pressures of a fine-dining place. Moreover, the menu is not overpriced and has a variety of mains which include rabbit leg! The service staff were approachable and friendly.",

The Girlfriend was quite taken with the European-looking wait staff, and his (French?) accent, so looks like there were points there for authenticity. The fam joined us for night 2, and we had a lovely booth to ourselves.Food was not an easy pick - there is a lot to choose from, and almost all of it sounded lovely! Over the two nights, we had loads: the cassolette of escargot was super tasty, especially with the garlicky mushrooms; the mackerel fillet was light, and the accompaniments added great balance (thumbs up for the dressing!); the lamb rack, pork trotter, boeuf bourguigon, and roasted chicken leg? All of it disappeared.Some say dessert is the measure of a complete meal, and perhaps they need a bit more work here. We didn't enjoy these as much - the Grand Marnier Souffle packed too heavy a punch for me, while the ice nougat was a new experience, but not much to shout about. Perhaps the starters and mains had already blown our tastebuds away. The shining light was the homemade lavender ice cream - that really cleaned up the palate after some heavyweight mains, and was quite a delight to finish.Service did well by me and the fam too, Manager Jovy made her rounds, and the two fellas were engaging and polite as they navigated the dining room.They've just started a Sunday lunch menu, which promises a lot of family style food - right up my alley. Now, to round up the kinfolk...Oh and check for credit card promotions! No better way to round off a dining experience eh?",

The restaurant is cosy and the service is good so I was looking forward to trying the food.Had the pan fried duck foie gras with caramelised pears which was quite good followed by the grilled Angus rib eye with cognac black pepper sauce. Thought it was decent but thought the steak began to taste a bit bland halfway through, unlike certain places like Bedrock and Gordon Grill where the steak remains tasty throughout. F had the beef flank steak with shallot sauce and quite liked it. We skipped on dessert as we were too full.Wasn't blown away but might come back to try other dishes.",

The waiters were all dressed up and the warm lighting inside with tables tightly packed were quintessentially Parisian. The menu did not disappoint. Good old classics like Coq Au Vin, Confit de Canard, Escargots and Soupe a l'Oignon got me excited. The mackerel salad had caught my eye as I remember a rather delicious variant when I was visiting the French Countryside. I went with that, as well as the Poulet Rot\u00ee ( Orast Chicken) for my main course.The Mackerel Fillet marinated in white wine with scented potatoes salad had been so stunning, that was all I could think of since then. The perfumed salad had a light floral and earthy taste, possibly the doing of a herb infused oil. The fish was not the least fishy and it was delicate and soft, marrying perfectly with the potatoes that were lightly dressed. The greens and garnishing herbs were light in flavour not too overpowering, lending a great touch to the delicate textures of the dish. The main course were impressive, enough to leave an impression and a longing to be back.I manage to catch a glimpse of the lunch menu that seemed very economical at just $30 for three course. This is cheaper than the usual lunch set menus in Parisian bistro and with the quality of the dinner there, I am sure to go back to try their lunch!",
