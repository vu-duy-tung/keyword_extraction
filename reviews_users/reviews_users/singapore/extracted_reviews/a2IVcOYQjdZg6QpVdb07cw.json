Service has improved but is still a little lacking in the speed and friendliness departments. Don't let that keep you from checking it out though. Its definitely worth a try!",

    "text": "Awful. Only way to describe it, the $16 \"homemade\" mojitos were sickeningly sweet, and $2 more then I paid at universal studios of all places (and weaker), when I asked them for my second one less sweet I got soda water with no sweetness. I ordered the cheddar burger with bacon for dinner, the burger came out sans bacon and with a slice of American Processed Cheese slice that they claimed was cheddar. When confronted they admitted this was a cheese slice product and not actual cheddar, they got my bacon and offered to replace the cheese, I declined as I have discovered they don't remake your food here just repair it so I scraped it and ate a little bit. Not the wait staffs fault and they were attentive and pleasant but over all a terrible dining experience.",

    "text": "Probably the best style of American cuisine on the island. They put a lot of effort into the way it looks and feels inside as if you are actually going to a middle to high end American chain steakhouse. Ok, clearly this is a novelty place for Europeans and Americans to go live it like they were back in the states. By no means should they you expect a Morton's or a Ruths Chris. If you did please exit this conversation. ABSOLUTE BEST TIME TO GO \u00a0is on Super Bowl Sunday (well for Singapore is Monday morning). American School kids, executives, and anyone that likes the NFL will be there in the wee hours of the morning watching the game, eating a hearty breakfast of steak, eggs, and other food. Drinking mimosas, bloody marys and beers. When I was in high school I remember getting blotto and then showing up with a note that was clearly fake. Then the receptionist puts it on top of a huge stack of other clearly fake notes regarding a convenient doctors appointment or whatever. oh, the hilarity. I am a fan because of the memories I get when I go there.",
