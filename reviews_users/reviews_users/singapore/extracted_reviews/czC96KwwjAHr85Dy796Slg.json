    "text": "They say that Geylang has some of the best food in Singapore, and Little Vietnam is representative of one of those. It's surprising how difficult it is to find good and cheap Vietnamese food in Singapore considering how close it is to Vietnam. Even the Vietnamese food all the way in the Bay Area is often better and cheaper.Little Vietnam is the only saving grace. Fresh, quality ingredients and authentic-tasting Vietnamese food at reasonable prices (currently no GST or service charge) makes this one of my favorite haunts to frequent. They have some unique Vietnamese dishes that can't be found anywhere else.They have a good selection of salads like papaya salad and peanut salad. The banh xeo and claypot fish were very delicious as well. They also had some great drinks like the passionfruit juice and vietnamese coffee. You can order to your heart's content and not feel guilty about burning a hole in your wallet or clogging your arteries.",

    "text": "Wow, this place really does get busy! I popped by today for lunch and the place was packed!So I nabbed myself a seat for one and had the beef and brisket pho with fresh coconut juice. The pho was served in a giant bowl but was not completely filled. It looked like a lot but I easily polished off the bowl and probably could have done with more rice noodles and broth. Also, I noted some small bits of cooked chicken which was a bit unnerving when I discovered this at the end of my meal. The broth was subtle but incredibly well flavoured. There was a good amount of meat added to the dish but I was surprised that the usual additions that come on the side were already added into the soup. The young coconut was fresh and was a refreshing addition to my meal. Very reasonably priced totalling $11.50. Overall really good and the broth was the standout.",

    "text": "Pretty rough experience. If we could do half stars, I would. For the record, we are American tourists here in Singapore so excuse us if we are ignorant of what is commonplace here.For starters, charging guests for a cup of tap water, without letting us know. Again, I don't know if that's the norm for restaurants here but it isn't in most restaurants we've been to abroad or in the states. We paid for three cups of tap water. Tea had a charge too but that we can let slide. At least let us know.Then a waitress brought out an extra bowl of pho that we did not order. We politely told her that we did not order it and to bring it back to the kitchen, which she did. Later, the original waitress who took our order in the beginning came back to argue with us, and tried to convince us that we did in fact order that bowl of pho. She even brought the bowl of pho back out as if it amounted to any sort of evidence. It didn't look like she wanted to leave without forcing us to take the bowl so we relented, having better things to do with our busy itinerary.We thought the worst of it was over but the whole time we were eating, we could hear them talking amongst themselves in Vietnamese right at the counter, arguing back and forth about that damn bowl of pho; whether to take it back, to leave it there, wondering if we were going to eat it or to charge us for it. (Of course we were going to pay for it). It sounded as if they were not at all concerned if we understood them or not but I'm pretty sure they know we can understand them because they took our damn order in Vietnamese. They wouldn't leave the matter alone and kept bickering about it and kept mentioning us in a rude manner. It ruined our appetite and greatly upset us to have this as our first interaction with the locals here in Singapore. Left a bad taste in our mouth, literally. I'd avoid this place at all costs if this is how they treat their customers, especially customers who even chose to foot the bill of the restaurant's mistakes.",

It falls into the category of \"I don't mind eating it but I won't think about returning\". We were a big group and we tried a variety of dishes. Apart from the pho, the bun, both fresh and fried spring rolls (fried ones are better), we also tried the carrot cake (like a plainer version of our local white carrot cake), quails (4 tiny birds for $15 but tasty with some ice cold beers), cockles, gong gong, etc.On a breezy evening, it is nicer to sit outside where you get the evening breeze (plus some traffic smoke). There's parking in the building itself.",
