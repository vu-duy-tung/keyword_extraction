    "text": "Came here on a business trip to Singapore, at my coworkers' suggestion. It's a little hard to find, kind of buried deep inside this tucked-away commercial district in Dempsey. They have an extensive menu, all done very well. We were a large group and ordered several different dishes - probably at least a dozen, and without fail, they each were tasty, and eagerly scarfed down. The ambience is nice - they had a live band singing the standard American songbook (50s/60s/70s/80s pop, rock, etc., including modern day pop).The only thing that might be disappointing is if you're a beer/microbrewery connoisseur, particularly if you've been to a place in the US like Portland, OR. Nothing about this place said \"microbrewery\" other than the name and a decent beer menu itself. I guess it's just that when I think of a microbrewery, I tend to think of places that have all the machinery you tend to see at every other notable microbrewery. Without that hardware, I don't know how you're not just a bar serving lots of different kinds of beers, like any other bar, if that makes sense. Myself, I'm not much of a drinker, so I wasn't particularly disappointed, but a number of my colleagues did notice and mention the same thing I did about the place. Prices seemed really good, but maybe because of the relatively strong dollar. We ate very well, for not a whole lot of money. I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "Until now, I've never given a 1 star review on Yelp. Unfortunately, I found it hard not to do so after my first and likely last visit ever to this microbrewery. My girlfriend and I stopped in with some friends for a drink in the mid afternoon. I had heard good things and am always excited to try a microbrewery. It was 1 for 1 on all beers, and I started with the Weisen. I am usually a big fan of Weiss beers, but this one not so much. Not sure exactly how to describe it, but it simply seemed overdone and very tart. I was happy to move on to a lager from there, but things were about to go downhill. Mid conversation, I felt something hit my back. Upon further inspection, it was bird poop...not cool, particularly for an INDOOR restaurant. Sure enough, there were birds perched in the rafters above. Thankfully I wasn't eating, but I could never return to this place for a meal without the thought that bird poop might come raining down on my meal. If you are curious, the lager wasn't great either (and I would hardly classify it as a lager--it was cloudy and almost like a wheat beer). The service was nothing special, and even a bit awkward/unhelpful at times as they had no idea what was in the mixed drinks on the menu. They tried to bring our bill before we cashed in our free beer. We then had to request the bill twice after our second round. In a highly competitive Dempsey Hill, you can do much, much better.",

The place is quite run down, with cheap metal furniture decorating the outside area, and pretty gross toilets that smell pretty bad as they have a sign asking customers not to throw toilet paper down the toilet bowl which results in a big bin of exposed used toilet paper sitting in the loo for goodness knows how long. \u00a0What better way to ruin an appetite seriously.The food is very mediocre - any zi char or thai restaurant in your neighbourhood would probably be a worthy rival to this place.The live music wasn't what you would expect at a bar either - rotating between Hokkien, Mandarin, Cantonese, Thai, English.. some with accompanying dancers...The only saving grace would their beers that they serve in towers - ain't half bad, but I won't be running back even for the beers.",

    "text": "One of the most interesting dinning experiences I had at Dempsey so far. Amidst the posh dining enclave that is Dempsey hill, Tawandang sticks out like a sore thumb. Its ambiance is remarkable casual and it has a live show of some sorts. The show is an ensemble of acts from karaoke to musical (an abstract from Snow White and the seven dwarfs) to beer drinking competitions??? The host of the live show tries to engage the audience as much as possible. At times, even cajoling the waiters on stage to participate in a song & dance on stage. Strange. But entertaining nonetheless. I can't help but think that this incoherent string of performances (at times tacky & impromptu but always hospitable)... sorta mirrors restaurant/bar entertainment culture of Thailand. You sorta feel that your waiters are not just your servers. They try their best to keep you entertained throughout your dining experience even if that means they have to put together an amateurish string of performance. You can't help but feel welcomed. \u00a0At the surrounding tables, I notice clusters of friends (of all age groups) clapping, singing and cheering along with the performances. It's definitely was an entertaining night filled with authentic thai food and an ambiance to match. However, I might caution against bringing a first date here. The music is definitely too noisy for any meaningful conversations to take place (unless you opt for outdoor seating). The food 1. Cripsy prawn crackers - Great! How can one go wrong with prawn crackers???2. Pineapple fried rice - Ok. 3. Pad thai - Good. 4. Grilled squid - Ok. Not much flavor though. Could use a more intense marination? 5. Prawn spring rolls - Good. It came served with a piece of strawberry pierced though the top via a cocktail-pirate-like-sword. Strange. 6. Thai fish cake - Pass. Not impressed. 7. Fried pork knuckles - Great! Even though I do not typically like this dish. The porky smell was musk well. My only complain was that it took way too long to come (it was served almost at the end of the meal which meant that we were already 80% stuffed and had less space for this yummy dish. Everything else came very fast though, despite the crowd.) 8 . The fried seabass! It's so good :) - My favorite dish. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. How did they do it??? Magic. The sweet thai chili sauce was a perfect compliment to this wonderful dish. I would come back just for this. Like the pork knuckles, my only complain was that it took way too long to come. 9. Red ruby with coconut dessert - $10 - BAD. It was crazy sweet!!! sweeter than a Starbucks carmel frapp! That's how tooth-rotting it was. The coconut milk wasn't freshly made too. It tasted they used a can version. But the red rubies were ok and they threw in a few other toppings too (to be able to charge $10 for it). I found some jackfruit slices in it. However, the ridiculous level of sugar in this dessert rendered everything else inedible. The service - Remarkable fast for most dishes except #7 & #8 (which were the best). I guess mum was right when she said good things come to those who wait?",

The lager was a tad sweet and didn't quite meet the expectation. The dunkel was ordinary but acceptable. For the price though? I think not. Despite it being a \"Modern Thai Cuisine\" restaurant, the must-try at Tawandang is actually the pork knuckle. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Missus had the typical thai basil leaf minced meat rice which she insisted was authentic. But nothing was more authentic than our server's thai. Entertainment was watching the Thai waitresses danced to the spanish songs being played at the restaurant. Are you surprised we never went back again?",

She was not wearing a uniform like the rest of the waitstaffs did, she was always going around hovering at tables looking SOUR faced. When she tried to bring food to our table, we were trying to tell her which food goes to where, and she looked Displeased. Very sour and unprofessional. The whole night she looked sour. She could be a manager or maybe the owner herself. But this made me NOT want to come back. Food was good, but wow. The waitstaffs were ok, not too friendly, but not rude either.The 4 stars above is STRICTLY for the FOOD. For the service I would rate them a 1 Star.",
