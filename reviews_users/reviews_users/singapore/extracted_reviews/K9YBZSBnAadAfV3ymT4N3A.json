There's additional caprese sandwich served with chips and kale salad and a house special pizza rolled up like a spring roll. Both are good, pizza was especially filling because of all the cheese. It's a self service restaurant but the staff was very helpful seeing I'm with 2 kids.",

Beware of insects and other bugs around while dining. Make sure you not eating one of them. Make sure they are not crawling on you. Felt so tourist brunching here, surrounded by doggies around.Thought a table was empty. Turned out someone tied the dog to the table to chope the table. Asked the next table who couldn't answer. Waited about an hour for the food to arrive, as porridge just ran out when I placed order. Else it would be about 30 minutes.Fish Belly Porridge (S$14.50)Served with a side of dough fritters & century eggOne could taste that the fish belly had gone through stir fried with rice wine before adding to the porridge. There's a distinct soya bean milk aftertaste in the porridge. Homemade Pork Meatballs Porridge (S$12.50)Served with a side of dough fritters & century eggThe meatball porridge was pretty bland, comparing to the fish belly porridge. Drunken Chicken (S$10)The chicken was tender but surprisingly sweet in taste and lacking of the alcoholic taste which associated with the dish. Pig's \u00a0Innards (S$9)Not sure why but the dish was served with porridge like grain. The pig's liver was a tab too rare and quite veiny too, making it quite an effort to chew. The intestine had lingering bitter taste.",

I gotta say some of the staff are extremely nice and friendly but some don't seem to care at all. I wonder why there's such a huge disparity in service quality. You don't get seated by the staff but instead look for your own table. Some of the staffs were really nice to help me look for extra chairs for my table. Go early on a weekend (if you really want to visit...), it was extremely crowded by 11AM on Sunday!If possible, choose a table outside because it's extremely hot and stuffy inside. Pets are allowed! We saw some fur babies sitting outside with their owners. You order at the counter, take the drinks with you and they serve the food to your table. Food and drinks were overpriced and really meh. We tried a variety of things, from their porridge, to chili crab pasta, spam fries, big breakfast etc. Nothing spectacular. For an iced coffee that costs $6, it came in a plastic takeout cup. For such a high price point, I would've expected hand poured lattes but they came out of the machine.Unless you're already at Botanic Gardens and don't have much food options, this place is not worth a visit.",

I had a craving for a cheeseburger, and was not disappointed. There is seating area outside where you can see the chefs cutting the veggies and making the pizza. Once you order, the cashier gives you an electronic disc, which you are to place on the table, it informs the staff where you are seated to bring your meal to you. Note, that i think it said place the disc on the green circle...but on our table there was no green mark. But, you can see a slightly different gloss painted area (or just look under the table to see where the sensor is). Food was good and prompt. Just note that at the end, the birds in the area may stop by for a visit to steal any left overs there may be....",

All cooked and prepared well. \u00a0One reviewer already commented that the pricing seemed a bit high for the dishes, and particularly since you're placing the order directly at the counter ... seating is also casual and non-AC. \u00a0Just wish that the service was friendly and knew when to say \"thank you\". \u00a0As a customer, I probably overstate my appreciation to service providers ,,. but when consistently not reciprocated, then no matter how good the food is, it really isn't worth dining there. So four stars for the chef ... and two stars or less for the less than friendly service.",

It's quiet, usually cool enough out that you almost need a sweater (ok almost) and they thankfully play old jazz standards. The manager and server FIfi are a service team of a calibre we haven't seen anywhere else in Singapore in our two years of eating our way around the red dot. The rest of the staff however are not very useful so if you pick a night when the manager is off duty it will not be the same. The food quality is good. It's casual Italian bistro food with good pizza options, pastas and salads. They do fresh juice juice and they do have a wine list though it could use a little help from someone who knows their wine. The day time scene is very different, they convert the restaurant into a cafeteria style place where you line up and dishes arrive at tables at random. The food quality is pretty decent but it's a bit frenetic and you might be waiting a very long time for everyone at your table to be able to start eating.",

The food here is excellent, no complaints from me, and prices aren't as steep as what most people would assume. Its a very common sight to see expat couples, both caucasian and Japanese, having breakfast here or with their pets, sipping on tea. Casa Verde is nicely sheltered, so seating outside is really okay as well. There are no smoking tables here, and it being the Botanic Gardens, you can't just anyhow smoke. So smokers have to take note.",

The outdoor sitting is not too humid and is nicely shaded. You'll usually see expats walking their dogs around dining and enjoying the food as well as the brisk morning air. Once you're stuffed, you can always take a leisurely stroll through the Botanic Gardens to shed some weight, something you'll never see me doing!",

The omelet was quite small and although I'm not a big eater could easily finish two of those. Filled with \"mixed peppers\" and cheese, at least the peppers were not mixed at all. The surface of the omelette was a bit too dry--either because of to much frying or wrong frying. Gourmet breakfast was ok. Although I didn't care much for the sausages. Guess you're paying for the locations. The food was a bit overpriced for a self service restaurant. We were sitting outside and the music was fighting an acoustic battle with the fountains just outside the restaurant. To see someone wining would have been nice. :) Coffee and location were good. Side salad was ok.",
