    "text": "This is a 3 and half star restaurant for me. It reminds me of a typical higher end vegas hotel restaurant. The produce is good but the execution falls short. The lobster and foie gras and truffle that we had were really of good quality but they were just not cooked as perfectly as they should. We started out with the seared foie gras and lobster salad. The foie gras was a teeny bit overcooked, and slightly underseasoned. \u00a0It wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't overwhelmingly good for me. The lobster salad had a generous portion of chunky lobster meat, and the little gem lettuce was really fresh, but the french dressing was terrible. It tastes completely like thousand island dressing, and was way too heavy and creamy for the delicate lettuce and lobster meat, which was a shame. I had the boulebaisse for my main, which is a french seafood stew. I really liked the stock because I love lobster bisque, and it was rich and tasted like a good lobster bisque, with hints of sherry. The produce was okay, but the fish was very bland. My husband got the truffle homemade pasta with aged parmesan. We thought it would be a truffle-infused pasta, but it was normal pasta (homemade though) with some truffle slices on it. The aged parmesan sauce was a tad disappointing, and lacks the complexity and deepness of aged parmesan. It was an okay cheese sauce, but nothing to shout about. Service was decent and prompt though.",

The New Orleans Casserole with mussels and sausages is also a treat. The duck dish prepared in three different ways is a pleasant surprise. Both the mussels and the duck are dishes good for two. And for the dessert, my favorite is the profiteroles with a chocolate disk that melts when they pour the extra chocolate sauce. Oh and before I forget, have a dirty vodka martini before you begin your dining experience -- the best way to relax to enjoy your dinner.",

It was not bad, and I certainly did not regret going, but none of the dishes really stood out.One of their signature dishes here is obviously the famous burger. I tried the original db burger and it was good. I loved the unique combination of regular beef burger patty, foie gras, and braised ribs if I remember correctly. It was very creative and I don't think you can have it anywhere else in the world. But the bread/bun was disappointing. It really was a huge distraction from that wonderful patty.The other dishes were OK, I suppose. Tried the casserole, snail & chicken fricassee, some fishes and they were all good. We also had the Kagoshima beef and it was very good, very simply done, but then again, it is much harder to screw up such a wonderful piece of meat than to do it right.All in all, I definitely won't mind going here again if my friends or family want to but there are a lot better of restaurants in Singapore.",

    "text": "It's been three years since my wife and I officially moved to Singapore. This date only came to our attention while we already sitting in the DB Bistro Moderne. We could not have chosen a better place to celebrate. After a long thirsty afternoon walking around the city, we ended up at MBS. It's hard to select a place to eat in this are due to all of the many and high end gourmet restaurants in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, but we checked a couple of reviews on Yelp and decided that DB was the place of choice. We got a table without a reservation without a problem, ordered two iceberg lettuce salads, a DB burger and some French Onion soup. Drinks were a Brewerkz Pale Ale and a mint, lime and ginger lemonade. The service was very good, it was very friendly and a casual glance at our fellow diners indicated people were really enjoying themselves. The bread they brought out before the salad, was great, but then the salads arrived. Wow. The lettuce was very fresh, crunchy and not too big (being a confirmed carnivore, I tolerate salads, just) the blue cheese dressing with bacon bits added had great flavors. , and before we knew it they were gone. My wife was not as hungry as I was, so she ordered the French Onion soup. It arrived complete with the Gruyere cheese melted and floating on the top. Taste was wonderful. My DB burger was stuffed with short ribs and foie gras. I had never tasted foie gras before and despite some countries banning it, I decided to give it a try. The burger was cooked to perfection, medium, just like I had ordered. The short ribs and Foie Gras were spectacular. The French fries tasty, with a portion size that was the right side of \"not too big\". Washed down with the Pale ale from Brewerkz it really did hit the spot. Can you say that a $42 burger is good value? Maybe not but the taste was truly exceptional. We let the food settle and followed it with some excellent coffee. It was a great experience here.",

We loved the goug\u00e8res with grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese and Basque pepper Piment d'Espelette ... it was so addictive we could have eaten a dozen of them easily. The bread platter had a good selection of different types of bread. We had the foie gras terrine with quince ... it was a bit too rich and heavy for me but otherwise smooth and creamy. I had the steak frites which came as a nicely pink and juicy sirloin but personally I prefer the fattier ribeye cut. The fries were pretty awesome though. Friend had the burger but was very much unimpressed unfortunately. Verdict? I just want more of those gorgeous goug\u00e8res.",

Their Duck Confit is pretty good and The DB Burger is really a must try. The steaks are average so I would not recommend splurging on that. We went there for a date on Valentine's day and wrote a feedback to the management that the overall experience was good but the service can be improved. The table next to us had plates sitting in for 20 minutes after the couple that occupied the table left. The staff could have cleared it immediately as it was not that busy.The manager responded to me via email thanking me for the feedback and was told to book with him directly for future reservations.Compared to other Celebrity Chef restaurants here in Singapore, DB is one of the few worth splurging on.",

    "text": "Chef Daniel Boulud, better known as Daniel has opened his first Southeast Asia restaurant; db Bistro Moderne at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) early last year (I am not counting his Beijing outlet since China sits in East Asia than in our SEA region). At 57, he is a well established celebrity chef who owns many high rating restaurants in the West. Born in France and culinary trained by notable French chefs, he emerged as a rising star, marked with many awards. His fame continue to rise after his NY restaurant; Daniel receives the most prestigious rating and becomes - Michelin 3-star restaurant. Daniel is well-known for his traditional French cooking with a touch of modern American flavor (This speaks well for the attention he receives in New York, he clearly understood what appeals and suits the Americans with a twist). \u00a0 \u00a0The restaurant is located at basement 1 of \u00a0Marina Bay Sands- a luxurious integrated resort with a world-class casino and famous Sands Skypark. It is easily accessible by public transports; where the most convenient way of getting there by Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), alighting at Bayfront station. One should spot the restaurant effortlessly as it lies just opposite Grand Theater's ticketing counter. \u00a0 \u00a0Arriving at 4ish in the afternoon, the restaurant was only 15% filled with diners, probably due to brunch hours. With my reservation, I was being ushered politely to a leathery rosso dining banquette. The bistro looks elegant, dressed up in stylish hanging globes across the ceiling. To me, it was all sexy and chic and thanks to Jeffrey Beers, the Architect and Interior Designer. The ambiance was laid back but not on the service. The main courses were served in 25mins after they have been placed. First came the Coq au vin; braised chicken cooked with wine, wild mushrooms, pearl onions, few stripes of pork belly and most notable lardons. The sp\u00e4etzle (a form of egg noodles but small button-shaped) \u00a0was served alongside in a iron cast dishware. The dish looks attempting and it gives off an exhilarating winy aroma. I immediately helped myself with the chicken thigh (it came with 2 drumsticks and a thigh) and it was all comforting. The thigh was well soaked with the thickened wine juices, leaving the skin jelly-liked. However, the meat was a bit tough and chewy. Unfortunately, the drumsticks taste similar, I'd believe it shouldn't have happened on drumsticks. I am puzzled over the meat texture, even until now. On the brighter side, the thickened gravy was heavenly and you ought to drizzle it over those sp\u00e4etzle to enjoy, it mustn't be wasted. The pearl onions were sweet & so fresh that they were all crunchy at each bite! The barely noticeable stripped pork belly and cubed mushrooms were thoroughly braised and yummy. I smiled at those lardon bits that made the dish taste even better just like seeing a plate of Char Kway Teow sprinkled generously with lardons, full of guilt but gratifying. \u00a0 While feeling a little upset over the chicken meat, I am so delighted that I am right about Fried Eggs Lyonnaises! The \"not-so-popular\" egg dish was a surprise. I am amazed that the duck confit was so well done that it was so soft and delicate (the fact that the duck meat was even tender than coq au vin's chicken drumsticks, makes me felt worst over it) and the caramelized onions add an extra sweetness to the meat. It was not gamey at all! The cubed potatoes embedded underneath the layer of cheese were equally delicious.Not to be missed - db's desserts! I have a soft spot for desserts and their Warm Madeleines were to die-for! The 20 petit cakes wrapped in linen for warmth, appeared ballooning and lip-smacking. Each was light and spongy. The center was air-filled with a pronounced lemony taste. It was delectable on its own, even without the capped icing dust. It was definitely a highlight on the dessert menu.I confessed, being gluttony, I could not stop at only 1 dessert. I'd to have another when some new flavors caught my eyes. I decided on something more; a scoop of Cherry Blossom ice-cream and another Honey-Buttermilk sorbet. The cherry blossom ice cream was pretty-looking, bright and pinky. It has a tangy taste but nothing flowery. I figured it was more of a cherry flavor while naming it blossom to make it sound beautiful. On the other hand, the honey-buttermilk was nothing more than a sweet milk concoction without great distinction. In all, I am satisfied with db Bistro Moderne. The $100 bill is worth trying out a Michelin-3 star's cousin after all.Thanks to the Alsatian born chef; Stephane Istel who manned the stove at the MBS outlet, I had a memorable bistronomic affair altogether.",

Nothing too out of the ordinary, but it was good.For mains me and my friend had the famous DB burger. The first few bites of it were exquisite. The flavorful patty, stuffed with foie gras and short ribs, was fantastic. It was juicy, well seasoned, and incredibly rich. The roll was a nice soft bun with just enough structure so it doesn't fall apart, and the lettuce and tomato served there purpose. The main problem was as good as those first bites were, after about half of the burger the richness becomes overwhelming. Between myself and a friend we could have split one burger and been content. It needed something to cut through the richness. The fries were pretty good; crispy yet fluffy - basically a typical restaurant style fry. Altogether though, $42 is way too much for a burger. I don't think I could justify getting this again.The service was good enough, though I do feel as the restaurant got a bit busier our table started to get ignored. The decor is pretty typical upscale bistro style. I would come in again to try other offerings. Basically the restaurant is pretty good, but you're paying a lot for Daniel Boulud's name.",

I'm not sure it was the best combinaton though - both the souffle and sorbet had muted profiles that disappeared into an indistinct nothingness when eaten together. his internationally-lauded madeleines were tiny little things nestled lovingly in a cloth basket and dusted with sugar - soft and cakey. I thought them a little one-dimensional though, and a tad too sweet without a cup of tea to wash down. it was a generous serving - far more than we could (or wanted to) eat at a single seating, so we doggy-bagged about half and ordered the hot chocolate fondant.a lava cake is so nineties, I know, but it doesn't stop me loving it. this was a decent rendition. I have a suspicion that the innards of the cake aren't uncooked cake batter - which drops it a couple points in my regard - but it was quite chocolatey and served with two scooops of delicious ice cream. so, decent desserts, though I would still pick the wolfgang puck establishment over this. the desserts here are a little lighter on the wallet, and the portions slightly more generous - which makes it a pretty good option if you're in the area.",

The Frenchie for example had a slice of pork belly which particularly did not blend with the rest of the concoction or enhance it any way. Also never have I had a great burger in a place where they ask you how would you like your patty done, a burger patty is not a steak and since the chef has put together the offering the house should go with what they think goes best, they can have different burgers for those who like it rare v/s those who like it well done or since its a fine dining establishment have the option of accommodating the guest's request if the guest has a very particular way they want their burger...A meal with one of their basic burger with fries ( tad overdone) and a soda ( we had a mint lemonade, quite average) sets you back by $45 all inclusive not bad for a fine dining place with pretty good if a little over-whelming service....",

Next the flank steak frites which both my husband spit out- the quality of the beef was stringy and gross, not tender or tasteful. Plus the bernaise was gummy and looked as if it sat out all morning- not reminiscent of my love for steak frites in France.My husband ordered the burger with fois gras and short ribs, and much like the other reviews here the burger did not come together well. The ingredients did-not compliment each other in a far to rich flavor. Unfortunately this is the second experience at DB restaurant that was less perfect as we had the same experience at the Palm Beach FL restaurant. Short ribs that got spot out in the bush, our friends still laugh about how that could happen in a 5star restaurant-",

    "text": "Love, love, love it!First of all the service: FANTASTIC! Every friggin' person at DB Bistro was on point: the bartender, the hostess, the server bringing my food, the manager: all of them were friendly, chatty, pro-active and helpful. Take note, all other restaurants: this is how it should be! I have noticed that often restaurants serve subpar dishes during restaurant week, not DB Bistro! The dishes were also listed on their regular menu and were just great. I've said it before and I will say it again: simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication! I love innovation but a classic is often a classic for a reason and when it is executed well, it is hard to beat. I started with the Kale Caesar Salad: I will definitely be back for this, it was one of the best salads I had in Singapore. The dressing was in perfect ratio to the salad and the anchovies gave it that typical Caesar flavor. \u00a0The slow-cooked salmon showed great skill, in my opinion it was cooked just right! The dessert was another hit: the Molten Chocolate cake with the salted caramel sauce was pure indulgence.And this is not where the praise stops: the cocktail, recommended by the bartender, was simply amazing! I guess the only negative thing I can say about DB Bistro is that I ate way too much and that this experience spoiled many other restaurants for me as it will be hard to find somewhere in Singapore which matches the service and food of DB Bistro.In short: Awesome food, awesome service... they'll see me back at DB Bistro.",

When I first moved to Singapore, I wanted to take myself out to a nice place after my I closed my first deal at work, and knew there were some celebrity restaurants in the MBS. Being that I was flying solo for this dinner, I knew I wanted somewhere that I would feel comfortable sitting at the bar alone, and somewhere that had killer cocktails and amazing food. \u00a0DB had it all. \u00a0I was immediately sat at the bar, the bartender (I wish I could remember his name) was chatty but not annoying, and made his recommendations, and the service was excellent. \u00a0I had the lychee martini, some killer oysters, the salmon and the molten chocolate cake. \u00a0Everything was excellent. \u00a0Since then, I've been back about 4 times, I take clients there, I took my friends who were visiting from the US and have gone back on my own. \u00a0Each time the bartender remembers me and my name and always makes a point to say hello, which I think is a nice touch. \u00a0I've had everything from their lobster to the steak to the pasta and everything is good. \u00a0If you are looking for a special occasion place, date night, client dinner or lunch, or place to sit at the bar and enjoy some me time, DB Bistro is the place to be. P.S. (Don't skimp on the bread, it's delicious!)",

    "text": "Really wanted to like this place better. The Boulud name raised my expectations so it could only disappoint from there...which it unfortunately did. Whilst service was prompt and ninja-like, and ambience was very nice, the all-important food was a major let down. Especially considering we ordered the signature dish!We had: a DB burger and salmon tartare to share as we had only eaten brunch 90mins before. The DB burger was ordered medium but came out VERY pink. The foie gras inside was barely noticeable and made zero impact or difference to the burger. Whilst the texture of the burger was good, it was woefully under-seasoned and thus lacked any flavour. More salt would've probably helped bring out the flavour of the quality beef. A few miserable slivers of onion (for $50 a burger couldn't they have at least caramelised them?) and lettuce were scattered inside, along with a smear of mustard and ketchup. The parmesan bun was also totally underwhelming. $44++ is massively overpriced for a burger that would've been beaten in a blind taste test by Shake Shack or Omakase. On the plus side, the chips / French fries were excellent! Salmon tartare was very small and not at all worth the $22++ ...portion essentially what you'd get if it was served in a martini glass. Again under seasoned and lacking any real character. Even the bread basket they served us was disappointing, with bread that had the texture of being cut and out in the air for a few hours. Overall for what was essentially a meal for one, we paid $77 and didn't even order a drink. Don't be sucked in by the celebrity name, the food is far from what the price tag leads you to expect.",

The chickpea crackers were not doing the trick so we asked for more of the complimentary sliced baguette bread to use in its place. For mains, we chose Burgers: I had the Yankee Burger with cheddar cheese and my friend chose the Frenchie Burger. \u00a0The presentation of the tall burger and the condiments is really nice (see photo). The sirloin lacked enough seasoning to enhance the natural flavors of the high quality beef. (my friend had the same complaint). \u00a0Although I requested medium well, my burger was served at medium - still very pink in side. \u00a0I am always a little underwhelmed with the burgers here. \u00a0On my last visit, I had the Original DB Burger and remember having the same issues with it.The Good: The Dining Room is elegant and comfortable. \u00a0The Staff is friendly.The Bad: \u00a0Tuna Tartar needs less seasoning. \u00a0Burgers need more seasoning.The Verdict: I'm looking forward to returning again and exploring more of the menu.3.5 stars",

The decor is understated elegance, comfortable, attractive. \u00a0The tables are nicely spaced and the booths looked comfortable. \u00a0Unfortunately, we were seated at a table that was directly in line with the traffic from the kitchen to the dishing room so it was bit uncomfortable. \u00a0We has the steak tartare, frenchie burger, original db burger, fries, and for dessert durian souffl\u00e9 and maccarons.The food quality was good, as expected. \u00a0For the price, it was not as exceptional as expected. \u00a0The tartare was good, but I've had better. \u00a0The fries we under seasoned. \u00a0The burgers were delicious and the portion was small. \u00a0We shared everything and originally started with the frenchie, thinking it would be filling. \u00a0The portion was small so we ordered the db burger. \u00a0The patty was larger (after all, it is stuffed with short ribs and foie gras). \u00a0Two things pushed this from a three to a four:Service: server Mira was outstanding and attentive. \u00a0Kudos to the restaurant for having quality servers and kudos to Mira for caring.Dessert: the Durian souffl\u00e9 was over the top delicious. \u00a0Durian is such an odd fruit and forbidden in many places for the smell, so I was surprised to see it on the menu. \u00a0Mira and I had a brief conversation about how they actually use real durian and the controversy around that.Th maccarons were also very good and surprisingly affordable (6 small for S$10). \u00a0The best, of course, were the madelines served after the meal. \u00a0These were heaven. \u00a0Light, fluffy, lemony, warm, dusted with powdered sugar.All in all a good experience, but with so many choices for dining in Singapore, I doubt that I will return to this particular venue.",

The French Onion Soup was very good, though quite pricey, but definitely the best french onion soup I ever had, unfortunately though that wasn't what \u00a0I really wanted. I came here for the burger, and the reason dB Bistro Moderne is only getting three stars instead of four or five.The burger had quite a burnt tast, and I ordered medium. The beef didn't seem to be of a high quality, which is disappointing as I'm sure they spent a pretty penny on it. The bun was soaked and surprisingly depressing. If only they knew how to keep the bun dry. I ordered the Yankee Burger and really don't have anything positive to say about it. I'd take a Carl's Jr. Six Dollar burger over this any day of the week...and it's a third of the price. I really want to try this place again since the French Onion soup was so good and the bartender hooked me up with free Madeleine's, which were fresh and very buttery. Next time I'm in Singapore I'll be back here, and hopefully I get more of the French Onion Soup, awesome Madeleines and great service, and less of the horribly overrated disgusting burger.",

    "text": "I ended up at db Bistro & Oyster Bar by sheer happenstance. Came out to Marina Bay Sands for the SG50 food festival. The event was packed (seemed to capacity) and soooo very hot. I lasted all of 15 minutes outside \u00a0before I called it quits and decided to enter the MBS mall. Of course, the mall was packed too. Decided on French food for lunch, got in the queue for db Bistro, and after a ten minute wait...we were in. Looking over the menu I realized I was, duh, in a Daniel Boulud restaurant...oh, db! Score! Lovely dining room. Much more elegant and modern than a French Bistro but not stuffy. Another positive, although the restaurant was full, I was able to hold a conversation with my table mate with no problem. The staff was very efficient, our server very helpful. \u00a0For such a busy day, our food came out rather quickly. That was a nice surprise.I started off with a db signature Bloody Mary, it's a meal! The drink included: a skewer of prawn, ham, pickled veggies, and a the all important stalk of celery.To go with the Bloody Mary, I ordered French fries with three dipping sauces. Yum. And a lovely chilled lobster salad. Taste was Meh. I should of stopped at the drink and fries because the salad was really boring. The person I was dining with ordered the New England casserole and he really enjoyed every bite. The casserole was loaded with: mussels, clams, shrimp, fennel sausage, and corn. And it came with two generous chunks of toasted garlic bread. So a score there.Three and a half stars. All in all, just an okay experience. I know, I know, it is a Daniel Boulud restaurant. But I am pretty sure he was nowhere in sight this Sunday afternoon. Other than a celebrity chef name and prices to match, there is nothing to compel me to return to this restaurant. At this price range, \u00a0there are many more restaurants I would rather visit upon my return to the MBS mall.",

(We just felt we ate too much and wanted to puke)Overall, it's a overpriced restaurant that I wouldn't go back because of the taste.

The service was mediocre -- somewhat slow and a number of mis-steps such as bringing food to the wrong person, letting water glasses go empty, and timing. The food was all good, but nothing that made us go \"wow.\" Portions are generous. The best thing we ordered was the seafood tower. Everything was very fresh and tasty.Would I go back? Probably. Am I excited to go back? No.",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner date at DB Bistro Moderne in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.The ambiance is modern with touches of the classic. \u00a0I do like the kitchen behind the frosted glass. \u00a0It is a nice comfortable room. \u00a0I think its great that the tables are not so very close together.tinyurl.com/c3ss58jThe service was extremely good. \u00a0They were attentive throughout the meal. \u00a0The staff was friendly, polite, and professional.The food ranged from good to exceptional.Complimentary Bread - For me, this was the weakest part of the meal. \u00a0There were three kinds of bread. \u00a0But I did not find any of them particularly interesting.tinyurl.com/c5lhsd7Steak Tartare (Cornichons, Capers, Parsley, Baby Romaine, Grilled Country Bread) - This was my date's selection for a appetizer. \u00a0I tried it and thought it was very good. \u00a0It was tender and oh so flavourful. \u00a0Truth be told, while I eat it relatively often, Steak Tartare is not my favourite dish. \u00a0But this was very good. \u00a0As with most of the dishes, the presentation was quite nice.tinyurl.com/bppfewdSan Daniel Prosciutto (Arugula, Toasted Country Bread) - i selected this dish as my starter. \u00a0This was truly excellent prosciutto. \u00a0This is living proof that great food starts with great ingredients. \u00a0So simple, yet so wonderful.tinyurl.com/cxpptrhThe Frenchie Burger (Beef Patty Topped with Confit Pork Belly Caramelized Onion, Morbier Cheese, Arugula, Cornichons, Served on a Black Pepper Bun)I selected DB Moderne so that I could try their burger. \u00a0I could not order their signature burger. \u00a0I no longer eat foie gras. \u00a0I selected the Frenchie burger. \u00a0This was the best burger I've eaten in Singapore. \u00a0It surpassed the burger at Omakase. But this really gets into the debate between diner style burgers and gourmet burgers. \u00a0I think the Frenchie was smaller than I expected. \u00a0But the ingredients were amazing and came together so well. \u00a0It was cooked to a perfect medium rare. \u00a0This allowed the flavour of the beef to shine through. \u00a0The Morbier cheese is what took it over the top. \u00a0It was such a great selection. I loved it.The fries were good but certainly not amazing.tinyurl.com/bnemgtkDuck Confit (Savoy Cabbage, Olive Oil, Crushed Potatoes, Mustard Jus)My date selected the duck confit. \u00a0This was not a surprise. \u00a0I tried it and it was quite good. \u00a0She really enjoyed in.tinyurl.com/cyr7vyoDessert - For dessert, she ordered the profiteroles and I ordered the chocolate fondant. \u00a0I tried both. \u00a0They were both chocolate lovers' dreams. \u00a0However, I preferred my chocolate fondant. It was just an explosion of chocolate.tinyurl.com/c6dzyrqtinyurl.com/cgvy2znSinister Americano - This was her cocktail. I tried it. \u00a0It reminded me of Fireball whiskey. \u00a0This means I liked it. \u00a0But, I am not sure how, for me, it would pair with food.tinyurl.com/dxn8gbwReceipt (Dinner for 2) - $211.86tinyurl.com/bn2j4ftOverall - DB Bistro Moderne provided all of the elements of a great meal; food, ambiance, and service. \u00a0The burger would rate with almost any in the world. \u00a0However, I think if they are going to do it, why not go all the way and make the burger of a more reasonable size for dinner? \u00a0The remainder of the food was also enjoyable. \u00a0 It just made for a pleasant dining experience.",

The wine list is insane both in how expensive and long it is. The bread they serve with dinner and the potatoes au gratin were very good. The coq au vin was decent. The Spanish dish had too much going on. The service was great.It was my mother's favorite meal in Singapore, but I can't really see myself going back. I prefer the French Stall (TFS Bistrot) and Saveur.",

    "text": "After lunch at Pita Pan, I hopped over to DB Bistro, where I had visited three times previously, for their revamped menu. This place has always been one of my favourite dessert spots in Singapore and it still is :)If you are thinking that the desserts here are over-priced or belong to the atas petite sized kinds that are gone in less than 3 big mouthfuls, then you might be interested to pop by here to have a look.Out from the menu is the old Apricot Vanilla Souffle. The new angmoh pastry chef Benjamin Siwek has gone local to come up with this \"Royale\" Durian Souffl\u00e9 ($15). This is by far, a souffl\u00e9 with the most character. The fluffy mixture seems insubstantial as one digs a spoon in but the flavour fills up the mouth just like HD surround sound system echoing in every space. The queen fruit, mangosteen, was turned into a sorbet to accompany the durian but I was too busy with the souffl\u00e9.The peculiar thing is that the chocolate dessert here did not make a show. The Milk Chocolate Mousse with Peanut Brittle and Banana Ice Cream($15)did not have multiple textures even though it sounds crunchy. The base sat a rather dry brownie-like cake layer which did not help to score points.Another Southeast Asian inspired dessert was the Jackfruit Verrine ($15) which caused everyone's face to cringe with an extremely sour Lime Sherbet. But once you mixed it with the Coconut Tapioca and Palm Sugar, it all went down sweetly.This was another satisfying experience and I am looking forward to the new items for the next season! And last but not least, I am grateful for the complimentary treat of db's (or aka da Bomb!!) Madeleines, which are still as light as those on my previous visit. They might be rustic bakes but once you try these, it will be difficult to find a better one!",
