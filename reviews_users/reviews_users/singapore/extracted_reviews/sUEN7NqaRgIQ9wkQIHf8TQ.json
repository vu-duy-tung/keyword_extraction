The ramen is good, I had the spicy ramen and it was pretty spicy. Also, tried different types of xiaolong baos- the cheese mushroom one was ok. I still like the original My friend tried the salted egg and chili crab xiao long baos.You can't go wrong with Crystal Jade- the food is good.

I've only visited the first floor - we ordered noodles and xiao long bao (dumplings) to share. Portions are a good size for the price, and dishes are hearty. Can't go wrong with any orders here at Crystal Jade! Downside: Usually very packed at peak hours, and difficult to make a reservation ahead of time; for some reason their line is always on hold... Expect a wait for dinner, so get there early by 6pm or after 8pm for a more pleasant waiting/dining experience.",

    "text": "I'm surprised there aren't better reviews for this! This is the first place I come to every time I'm back from studying abroad, for the unlimited xiao long bao & hot pot a la carte buffet (~$25 after tax). It's literally a no brainer because those are 2 of my favorite foods!! The hotpot is so good here. The soup in hotpot is crucial to me, if not its kind of no point eating all that food, and crystal jade has great fragrant soups. I always order a ma la & a pork bones soup with corn. The ma la is solid, without too much chili oil and retaining the flavor of the soup underneath. It's also not too heavy that I can drink it at the end (or maybe that's just me). The non spicy options are diverse and impressive, not like the generic tasteless chicken soup options at many hotpot places. I love drinking the non spicy soup too. The menu involved tons of ingredients - meats, prawns, great dumplings, la mian, lots of veggies, and so on. They also have small deserts like red bean & osmanthus jelly. The xlbs are lovely, with thin skin that's easily pierced. I always feel so ambitious eating it but after sharing 3 orders I feel a bit stuffed.Docking 1 star only because of how difficult it is to make a reservation. They do hotpot in time slots of about 1.5 hours each only for dinner, and you basically need a reservation to get in. But they don't pick up their phones and I often have to keep trying for 3-4 times...I still do it though!",

There is almost always a queue, and it gets especially crowded during lunch and dinner times even though I've never had to wait for more than half an hour.The food is decent- the xiaolongbao is consistently satisfactory, though it is nothing like Ding Tai Fung's 19-fold xiaolongbaos. They've recently also made each xiaolongbao bigger and downsized the 'long's to only containing 4 xiaolongbaos per portion, which is a good thing if you're sharing between two people. I also like their minced meat mixed sauce noodle (zha jiang mian), the sauce is sufficiently complex without leaving you too jelat. Service is fantastic even during peak hours. It is amazing how attentive the staff are. They mostly speak mandarin with a mixture of cantonese, but will have no problem understanding and taking orders in English.My favourite part has to be the vibe of the entire restaurant. It is super unpretentious- the waitstaff are all dressed nicely in uniforms, but you never feel out of place even if you wear flip flops (I cant say the same if I were to go Yan Ting for example). It is air-conditioned and always bustling as a restaurant should, but without the hastiness of HK tea houses.",

Great for late night supper as their last sitting is from 10 - 12 mn.XLB is good but not the best. But well, no complaints since its free flow. In fact, after a while, you just get OD on XLB. As for the steamboat, you get to choose between pork bone or ma la. The broth is tasty and the typical ingredients we find in a steamboat. Prawns are not free flow tho.The only problem is its very difficult to make a reservation. \u00a0Often, tried calling many times and no one pick up the calls.This crystal jade has two storey. Upstairs host the hungry diners for steamboat. If you are not in the mood for steamboat, you can order ala carte dishes downstairs.",

My grandmother is wheelchair bound which made choosing meal locations trickier, as the restaurant had to have a street entrance with a ramp of sorts. This branch of Crystal Jade fit the criteria so I suggested we came here for brunch today. We were given a table in the bottom level of the restaurant, but the entrance of the restaurant was rather cramped. While I was worrying about how the wheelchair was going to maneuver around the tight bend, a waitress surprised me by pushing open one of the glass panels in the middle of the restaurant to allow easier access for my grandmother. So cool! On to the food. The good dishes: Chao Shou (dumplings in spicy sauce), Spring Onion Noodles and Chong You Bing (scallion pancakes). The mediocre dishes: Xiao Long Bao and Fried Rice with Egg White and Fish. You'll be able to find better XLBs at Ding Tai Feng. On the whole, I enjoyed my meal here and I'll be back to try the other soupy la mian options!",
