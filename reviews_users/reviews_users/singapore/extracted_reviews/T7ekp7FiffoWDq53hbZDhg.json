I would definitely recommend this place to everyone who enjoys a relaxed yet classy environment to catch up with friends over some finger-licking fries! I just had their fries yesterday and i am already craving for more... do not miss the heavenly truffle fries or the mind blowing pumpkin Hazelnut fries. I tried the sliders and they were decent but nothing to write home about. The drinks are slightly on the pricey side of things.A good meal alone with some fries and a drink would set you back by around $40 per head but you will walk out saying that the experience was worth each penny :D",

That said, the Prohibition Long Island Iced Tea Party is potent as heck, and the main reason I keep coming back. Not for the Bay Prawn Capellini, nor the risotto, lovingly referred to as bee hoon and mui fan by my fans-of-kopitiam friends. Not even the star truffle fries can detract from the booze. It comes in a Chinese tea pot, separate from the soda, which lets you adjust how strong you wish for it to be. And very strong is the way we like it. Granted, it's meant for three or four, but the two of us down it like sky juice. We always leave in a good mood and as a result, keep coming back.",

    "text": "House has been around for awhile now and they've really set themselves apart from the competition with creative marketing and interesting decor. I really give credit to the Spa Esprit group for always having fun and creative ideas in all their ventures. I was here in the late afternoon on a Saturday, with one aim only: to try the pearl barley salad, an item on House's new menu. I was initially informed by a waiter that they were no longer serving lunch at that hour. That is, no food at all, except for fries and pizza from a separate menu. I was so disappointed! I noted however that the next table was given the lunch menu when they were seated shortly after us. With an undefeated, must-have-my-salad attitude, I asked another waiter if I could still order food. Perhaps this waiter felt my desperation or was persuaded by my earnest plea. He responded in the affirmative and I quickly placed my order for taro truffle fries and pearl barley salad, as well as a bottle of san pellegrino, beer and a carrot, celery, juice (obviously my dining partner and I have extreme preferences for food).The pearl barley salad was a tad expensive at S$15 and S$3 extra for grilled chicken. The serving size was big but essentially the dish was lettuce, crispy quinoa and barley. I can't imagine ordering this salad without the grilled chicken as it would have been too plain. However, I enjoyed the salad as it was clean and very light. I could eat the entire huge plate of salad easily. Will come back to House again for this, as I'm a sucker for light and simple but tasty salads. Also, having barley and crispy quinoa in a salad is just genius and I don't think I can get this anywhere else.The truffle taro fries were predictably good and quite reasonable at S$7 for a huge serving. These were crazily addictive - no complaints. I would have rated House with 4 stars except that the service was somewhat of a let down. The servers were not attentive and were often chatting amongst themselves or behind the bar or crowding around in a group, instead of looking out to assist customers. The wait was long for everything and it was hard getting the attention of the servers. Not to mention the inconsistent position taken when I first arrived at the restaurant. Why was I informed that I could not have food from the lunch menu by one person, and otherwise by another person? The first waiter didn't even bother to try and check with the kitchen if I could order from the lunch menu. When I told him/her I wanted to order the salad, he/she (can't recall which), adamantly informed me that lunch was over. I often saw food and drinks waiting at the bar for servers to bring them to the tables. It's like the customers are waiting for the food and the food is waiting to be served to the customers, while the servers are standing around doing goodness knows what. Well, I'll probably still be back as I like the variety in the menu - healthy choices and comfort food all at the same place. Easy and free parking is a plus too. Will be back, but hopefully the service will improve. Also, isn't it just silly not to serve your full menu throughout the day, at least on weekends?! Most establishments even serve all day breakfasts on weekends, surely a big restaurant like House can afford to do so as well. And it's not like they suffer from lack of customers on weekends - the place was full when I was there at around 4 pm on Saturday.",

    "text": "Great place to taste Spa Esprit Group's food all in one place, a nice setting as well right in Dempsey facing the lush greenery. I would say that the food is a little pricey but all for good reason, great taste and great location. I've always enjoyed the chinese stewed fatty pork bun so when I saw an upscale version of it on the House menu, i had to try it. The best part about this version is the fatty pork is served piping hot in a mini pot, well marinated in a spicy dark sauce along with fresh buns on the side for you to stuff with how ever many slices of pork you wish. This dish also comes with a side of sweet potato fries almost like strips and light on the palette. If you're in the mood for something light, try their signature Tau Sar Pau instead with Asian red tea, there is a set meal going on for that if I remember correctly. Either way just sit back and enjoy Dempsey!",

You take stairs down to the restaurant (so be careful of how much alcohol you consume because you will have to climb those stairs again when you leave)!The interior is very chic with rustic and modern elements. Their menu adds perfectly to their branding and offers fare that is a fusion of Asian and American. The menu is Paleo-friendly (as long as you have steel will power). I started with a mixed berry gin fizz ($19), which was sweet and so refreshing that I ended up ordering another (which is why I forewarn about the stairs when leaving). We totally cheated by starting with the mustard chili fries ($9) and the pumpkin hazelnut fries ($12). They have about 6 varieties of different fries and they all look awesome, so it was a tough call! I ordered the blackened snapper with quinoa, kale and sweet peas ($25), as did the other two at my table. It was cooked perfectly and the medley of vegetables complimented it perfectly. The service was prompt and polite. They were excellent about bussing the table and refilling drinks, which is sometimes hard to find in Singapore. I really enjoyed our meal and will be back. I'm rating them 4.5 out of 5 stars because the prices were a bit high for what it was, but we'll definitely be back.",

My Favourite is the seven layer pancakes. They still serve pancakes which I apparently ordered. Boy was I disappointed! It's dry and far from fluffy. My Husband ordered a duck confit eggs Benedict. It was a let down too. They are famous for the fries. So we ordered truffle fries; it was the best thing that was served on our table. And it wasn't even prepared fresh. We could tell it that the shoestring was frozen. I expected more from this acclaimed hidden gem.Expensive and food doesn't complement the price.

    "text": "This place is very hard to find! We booked a table for two on a Sunday morning for brunch and we had the paella, tuna salad, and truffle taro fries.The paella was meh, the ahi tuna salad was a teriyaki-ish tuna stirfried with a lot of oil, and laid on top of a bed of garden greens. I expected my salad to be a nice, clean salad with raw tuna. What I got was a bit of an oily shock for me. Let's just say I didn't finish my salad.Now, this place is supposed to be famous for their fries. I do love taro, and taro AND truffle oil TOGETHER? Disappointment. The taro fries were cut way too thin - matchstick-like, and after being absolutely deep-fried and crunchy, the delicate taro flavor doesn't quite come through. I was just crunching through very fried sticks with a mild truffle flavor. I think the fries could have been cut thicker, so that the powdery texture of the taro and flavor could be tasted.The best part of this place is their juices. They have a good range of expensive, but tasty mix of vegetable and fruit juices.I would not come back again. Not even if it was free.",

It's not at the 8 block, you need to go further back until you see the sign that says House.The decor of this place is really nice and cute! And the food is laid out in a really beautiful manner. I may have stained a couple of books that were placed open near the food though, oops.While overall there aren't that many items that make you go WOW, most of the items are pretty good. The overall experience of having an unlimited amount of pretty tasty teatime snacks arranged in really decorative ways is pretty awesome. I wish there were more heat lamps though, most things got cold very fast.Tea comes with high tea, so we got the mango tea, which was pretty good.Items that stood out:Truffle mushrooms - So goodCheese spreads and crackers - Decent selectionFries were pretty good, but how they brought them out made no sense. They came in sparsely restocked cups with tons of ketchup and 3 fries. Then finally like 1 hour later a giant batch of fries only came outDeviled eggs were really goodOther various items that I remember:Flat pizzas - Pretty creative, but very varied in how crispy the bread part was. Also was not very warm.Spinach tart thing - Pretty good, but is a little too spinachy. It just tasted like.. green. I think the spinach flavor could be cut by something else.Various cakes and pies and pastries - Pretty good I guessSalad - eh. The pickled fish was a bit grossOverall left extremely full and pretty satisfied.",

I think the trick was truffle oil :/ It started to get really oily at the end so that felt really sinful, but the fries were REALLY GOOD. The asian slider was basically just kong bah pao.

The Asian Sliders is really just braised pork and buns, but they do it quite well. The usual western mini-hamburger type sliders are also quite good. The brunch menu's eggs benedict/free form eggs are my usual order when I'm here, and while the 7-layer pancake sounds like a lot to stomach, it's actually only about 2-full pancakes, as it looks like a slice of crepe cake rather than 7 full pancakes. It's chockfull of fruits and cream though, yum.I love the way their menus present their food, done up to look like a faux lifestyle newsletter, excellent food photography is always so enticing!",

The dish that i ordered was the Moroccan spiced baby half chicken with saut\u00e9ed fennel and taro fries. Sounds nice but the chicken meat was really dry and not tender at all, and the taro fries had no taste to it and was a little hard.The truffle fries are what stands out for me.

I will also note that they are served with a bunch of fries and sweet potato fries. \u00a0it is listed as a main. \u00a0I think this is a mistake. \u00a0I think they should serve them individually as appetizers. \u00a0We certainly ordered them as an appetizer. \u00a0But we were stuck with a ton of relatively good fries and not so good sweet potato fries. \u00a0The sweet potatoes were an epic fail. \u00a0I have no idea why they decided to bread them before frying them. \u00a0If they want to contact me, I will tell them step by step how to make really great sweet potato fries. \u00a0Because their way is simply not working.tinyurl.com/9bbktqbtinyurl.com/993qhbaHouse Rib-Eye Steak - My dinner companion ordered this. \u00a0She really enjoyed it. \u00a0I tried it. \u00a0i placed it at the level I expect from second tier steak house chains like Stuart Anderson's Black Angus. \u00a0But, it fell well short of what I expect from top-notch steak houses. \u00a0It was a reasonable cut but it was not overly tender. \u00a0It did not have the grainy fat that I expect from a rib-eye.tinyurl.com/9noe87xJamaican Jerk Pork Tenderloin - Then there was the greatest disappointment of the meal. \u00a0I knew it was a bit of a risky choice. \u00a0After-all, we are quite a ways from the Caribbean. \u00a0First, there was nothing Jamaican about this dish. \u00a0Second, there was nothing even resembling a jerk sauce. \u00a0It is obvious the chef has never had a real jerk sauce before. \u00a0Honestly though, I could have easily forgiven shortcoming in authenticity. \u00a0But, the pork was bone dry. \u00a0It was difficult to swallow. \u00a0Rule #1 of cooking pork is to keep it moist. \u00a0I ate most of it. \u00a0I will note that the presentation was quite pretty. \u00a0There was lots of color. \u00a0Unfortunately, there wasn't any real flavor with that color.tinyurl.com/8mgnlrwOverall, it is a beautiful room, the staff is friendly, and the flow of the meal was managed well. \u00a0There were some gaps with the reservation and missing menu items. \u00a0The food was wildly inconsistent. \u00a0For the sliders, I will return though. \u00a0If not for the sliders, this would have probably been a two star review.",

    "text": "Upon arriving at the cafe, the host didn't tend to us nor tell us to wait, he was busy chatting away in his phone.When he finally attended to us, he took a long time looking for our reservation and gave us a seat right under the blazing sun even when we requested to be seated inside where it was vacant.The menus for the beverages came in an overused gross soiled condition. Sure printing a new piece of menu doesn't cost too much.When our drinks came, our dear waiter got our orders mixed up. The prices of the place are way overpriced for a corporate chain trying to cash in on the hipster trend. To be far the food tasted decent but not worth the price as it didn't come with good service.To sum up this review, eat your food before going to the men's toilet as it absolutely stinks.",

    "text": "Most high tea in Singapore are on weekends and public holidays, it is rather 'rare' to find a weekday high tea buffet. \u00a0House@Dempsey chooses to be different, they have their high tea buffet \"Vintage Tea Party\" only on thursdays and fridays. I have been to many high tea buffets but this is probably one of the better high tea buffets. There are huge spread of items to choose from but they come in different \"batches\". One word of advice, don't stuff yourself silly to what you see on the buffet table, pace yourself for the varieties. In fact, the recent visit, I realized that some of the more interesting items, came out towards the end of the buffet hours. Aside from their high tea buffet, some of my favorites here are their Big Breakfast Skinny Pizza, Truffle Fries, Tiffin Punch's, and their version of Long Island Ice Tea. Great place to chill with friends or even have corporate offset meetings.",

    "text": "I love the warm, welcoming feeling of this place! The service staff were attentive and made the experience there a pretty good one. I was only there for dessert and hence can only comment so much on their foods. It turned out that having desserts here was a brilliant choice as their warm strawberry shortcake was absolutely divine!My friend and I got their warm strawberry shortcake (a known house specialty) and the blackforest cake, along with a pot of white rose tea. While the blackforest cake was decent, with a generous serving of kirsch spiked cherries embedded in it, the strawberry shortcake stole the show with its warm, moist and hearty goodness. The natural strawberry flavour was present in every bite and the vanilla sauce that was served to accompany it made it a heavenly treat. The tea went well with the cakes! Very fragrant and heart-warming. Loved it!",

Nestled in the forest of Dempsey Hill, the former British military barracks has been converted into a trendy and somewhat whimsical dining place. Ample parking at Dempsey hill has made this place wonderful easy to visit during the packed lunch hour. Especially if you want to avoid the ERP zones and crowded carparks in the city! You definitely have to give the Barracks Good ole Halibut Fish n Chips, Black Pepper Linguine, Squid ink paella a try. If you're just feeling peckish, their amazing truffle fries would do just fine! Check out their Vintage themed high tea that's available on Thursdays and Friday from 3pm onwards that serves a range of both sweet and savoury bites.",

    "text": "I like the creativity that goes into establishments like House, turning what was essentially a former office in a barrack (my uncle used to work here) into a restaurant. Yes, there is an air of silly brunching snootiness to the restaurant, but that can be said of most restaurants in Dempsey. Yes, the prices here can leave you balking, but I take it as payment for rent and free parking. The food here is quite simply...inconsistent, which is something I've experienced at other yuppy joints. That doesn't make things ok. They make really good sweet potato and truffles fries, but really, it's not rocket science to sprinkle truffle salt and market an ingredient that is as ubiquitous on menus these days as oh forbid, foie gras. They do a really good prawn capellini, but it really depends on your luck. On my most recent visit two Sundays ago, I waited half an hour for my pasta and it arrived bone dry. No funky Asian stock with al dente noodles. Just a really dry noodle cake. I sent back my order asking the waiter if the chef could add some stock . No one got back to me about my dish. Instead I waited another half hour before the waiter returned with a newly cooked capellini (I'm sorry but isn't it logical to ask your customer if they'd like to wait half an hour for a dish you screwed up?) and remarked, \"let us know if there's anything wrong with it\".No apologies. Ok.If by chance you're patient enough after an hour, an order of sliders may just show up. Again, with a waiter anxious to shove it on your table without any apologies. It will turn up dry despite your request for medium rare sliders. The sauce you were asked to choose doesn't come, so you basically eat a sauce-less burger. Add to that of course, coffee orders that show up later than the food, requests to check on the kitchen met with waiters running away as quickly as possible.If there's a lesson in restaurant management gone wrong, Gordon Ramsay has a winning episode here. Waiters are assigned to deliver drinks or food, not care for your table. The kitchen sections seem to work out of concert, not giving a crap about whether 2 diners get their french toast while the other 2 receive their food up to an hour later (and that's me being nice with time estimation). As someone hoping to do justice to the state of food quality and service in this country, I'm speaking with my wallet. You couldn't pay me to step foot in this restaurant again. Not even with pau, pasta, truffles or heck, Ryan Gosling busing my table.",

    "text": "First review for 2013 :)I was visiting Singapore for the holidays and a friend suggested coming here on a Friday for dinner. I had perused the menu beforehand, and was excited for the food.I made a reservation about 3 days beforehand and got us a table for 4 at 8:15 p.m. We arrived on time and were seated promptly. However, that was the only thing that was prompt - service the entire night was pretty slow, with us having to ask 4x(!) for water. I got the turkey skinny pizza and we ordered a side of the famous truffle fries to share. The bf got the sliders, and requested that no truffle oil be added for his fries (he hates truffles!). My skinny pizza was pretty good, but I'm a bigger fan of NY/Chicago/California style pizza. The bf said his sliders were dry and that the fries still reeked of truffle oil :( Overall, I think an average place. Some good stuff, some not so good stuff. Parking at Dempsey can be challenging on a Friday night as well, so be prepared to come a little early.",

    "text": "I've been here several times but had a different experience each time. Somehow the service standard is really inconsistent, thank goodness the food is not that bad.Most recently, I came here for dinner. We had a party of 5 and ordered a fair share of starters, sides and mains. We would've ordered dessert too, if not for the poor service.So our orders were placed, and our salads and three different types of fries (curry, sweet potato and carrot fennel) arrived in a decent amount of time. We were famished so we finished everything really quickly. The only exception was the carrot fries.... it's like a weird tempura carrot and it's too soggy. I wouldn't even consider it a healthier option because come on, it's deep fried how healthy can that be?? Not worth the calories.Everything started to go downhill from here. We waited at least 45 minutes to an hour for our mains to arrive. We kept checking with the staff but we got increasingly more impatient because they seemed to have done nothing to help our situation.Finally, a waitress told us that she had placed the orders for our starters first, and she decided to only place the orders for our mains after we finished our starters...... I guess that's an acceptable reason but still, it wouldn't take 45 minutes to prepare our mains, especially when the neighboring tables all got served though they were seated much later than us!!I accept their reason but I'm very disappointed that they did not show sincerity in their apology. The long wait for our mains really killed our appetite, and the entire dinner was ruined because nobody apologized for the long wait.I really doubt I'll return anytime soon. Their food is alright but maybe it's better to come on weekdays when it is less crowded.In terms of food, I think quite a few things are overpriced. Their truffle fries are really good though, and so are their thin-crust pizzas.Please check out my blog (on my profile) for more!",

It's one of those places in Singapore that has gone to great lengths to appear to be western but is missing the mark on a lot of the menu items and hasn't quite got the hang of service. Really you just shouldn't try to make a substitution or ask for something on the side. The confusion will take up half your evening. \u00a0That said we've still managed to have some nice times here. \u00a0As others have mentioned, the desserts and drinks are the stand-out menu items.
