I love the ribs because it falls off nicely from the bone and oh the sauce they glazed the ribs with is simply mouthwatering. Their fried chicken is quite moist.. not as dry as some fried chickens are.. and very tender as well. Ambiance here is also quite lovely.",

    "text": "Wasn't super hungry and had a fire-grilled Corn Guacamole with nachos and my hubby had chili as starters. The guacamole dip was ok, I found it slightly on the bland side. The chili wasn't very good either. In fact, I find Botak Jones made better chili, compared to theirs. \u00a0Hubby ordered a pulled pork sandwich which was actually delicious!! The pork was tender and flavourful! Very good indeed!!The kids ordered Mac & Cheese which was not bad. Corn on the cob was also nicely buttered and grilled. The cheeseburger and fries were ok, nothing to shout about. Not likely to return unless no other makan choices.",

    "text": "Yesterday was our first visit to Universal Studios Singapore, and as it was my husband's birthday month, we received a voucher from RWS Invites offering a free main with a meal set purchased. We purchased two full racks of baby back ribs, cheese fries and a lemonade for ourselves and three children. The portions are generous - we could not finish all the ribs! Both ribs came with a whole ear of buttered corn on the cob and a side of fries. The waiter was friendly and the glass of lemonade was refilled regularly, twice upon request.However, our middle child removed his expander retainers, placed them on the table during the meal and forgot to wear them again. We even returned to the restaurant to use the restrooms as the table was being cleared, but were not stopped to retrieve them. Perhaps this is because someone else cleared the table than our waiter who would have recognized us. In any case, we remembered less than an hour later and returned to the restaurant looking for them, but were told that they were not located. They said they will call us if they find them. I really hope they will find them for us, but it's been over 12 hours already without word. We even stopped by again in the evening and were told that they hadn't found anything yet. One of the staff even proposed that perhaps our child had taken them and left them elsewhere, but that was not true because we were all at the table when he removed them and he did not leave his seat until the end of the meal. Losing these retainers has made this our singularly most expensive meal ever.",

    "text": "Hmm where to begin. I mean, I just want to say, that the false advertising in the menu is a real issue. I would like to point out, that what really threw my partner and I off was that the menu clearly stated there were free refills for soft drinks, with no restrictions. Funnily enough, once we ordered a Coke to share and clearly asked for a second straw, which was given with no hesitation, they seemed to be okay with it. We asked for a refill, and once it was given, the waiter told us that we weren't really supposed to be sharing a drink but did not mention anything else. We asked them to refill it once again, but they refused because they had \"found out\" we were sharing. So now, we are sitting here at a table, thirsty, with the option of ordering further drinks, denied by the staff. Anyways, just a warning for future customers. The cheddar cheese is good.",

I thought the portion size would be a bit larger as it is an American style diner but the burger was pretty small, in fairness the enchilada dish was a little bigger. They have a large selection of dishes, drinks and sides so most people should be able to find something to enjoy. The drinks are expensive but it's Singapore so it's certainly not unreasonable, I've paid a lot more for drinks in other restaurants and bars here. My wife said her frozen Margarita was nice and had a good amount of tequila.",

    "text": "I've been to this particular Chili's restaurant many times before and each time I go, I thoroughly enjoy my meal. I usually have the fajitas or the burger. My absolute favourite is the Mushroom Jack Fajita. The sizzling hotplate appears with marinated grilled chicken covered in mushrooms, bacon, onions and cheese. It looks and smells good enough to eat on its own without the wrap, but the fresh tomatoes, guacamole, lettuce and sour cream adds a delightfully refreshing touch when everything is combined in a wrap. There is almost something sacred about eating an indulgent meal as such with your hands that makes it taste even better, and that is accomplished quite neatly with a wrap. I would also recommend the sides like the chips and cheese fries that make perfect sharing dishes.The staff have always been rather pleasant to us, so service is not something I'd complain about. Also, the most of the drinks are refilled for free. I go to Chili's almost every time I go to Resorts World Sentosa, and I won't hesitate to go again.",

As is the norm for chain store eating places in Singapore the customer service was sketchy at best. We were brought to our table and after several minutes of waiting had to request that a server come and take our order. Guess it has to do with tips being included in the price. They don't seem to care if you come in or not.",

    "text": "Chili's is one of my favourite restaurants. I am an avid steak fan love Chili's steaks and their Baby Back Ribs!! The food their is quite wonderful. It has got a variety of meats, sauces and other BBQ foods and also has amazing desserts like Choco Lava Cake. It is great if you are a carnivore but vegetarians do not have a lot of options and vegans... would really be trapped in terms of food. I love the food and is one of the steak places I recommend and the location is perfect for dinner after a long day at Universal Studios or just a casual lunch with friends. It also has a few TVs broadcasting live shows of different sports (I recently enjoyed the NBA Finals while chewing on my Ribeye!). The reason I do not give it a full 5 stars is because the food is heavy. Too much is not good and a lot of times, you would end up wasting or packing it for later consumption. I also think it is slightly pricey as there are steaks for S$39 but you could get similar quality steaks for S$10-15 less in nearby places. The menu itself looks like it is shipped from America and it is American food through and through. The ambience is quite a casual place and it is nice for a stopover or maybe a weekend dinner. My favourite part (besides the steak)? Is the service. The service is exceptional and food comes quite quickly after ordered. The staff is warm and friendly and when I went on my brother's birthday, they brought it a small cake with ice cream, complete with a candle. They also sang for him and I could see in his eyes how much he was enjoying himself. Overall, it is a great restaurant, but only if you have a big enough wallet.",
