    "text": "Great option for an indoor and aircooled food court. The range of options for dishes are extensive and cover a lot of the classics for Singapore such as hainan chicken rice, char kway teow, nasi goreng, etc. What puts this indoor food court above the other indoor options is the price and the quality. The prices are a few dollars higher than the outdoor food courts but are also a few dollars cheaper than comparable indoor food courts (ion mall, rasapura masters, etc.)I tried several dishes and really enjoyed the prawn noodles and grilled mackeral. The taiwanese fried salmon and vegetable soup was also pretty good.If your looking to escape the heat or introduce some friends to dishes in Singapore then Food Republic is a great option!",

I ordered 2 Meat 2 Veg, and it was ~$11.50. However, this cai png is around \"zi char\" quality, and they have a few dishes that you wouldn't find in a normal cai png stall, such as pork ribs. Much each to buy drinks here, compared to the Kopitiam foodcourt downstairs, since they have moving cars around that offer drinks. During peak hours, it can also be very hard to find seats here, so come during non-peak hours. I recommend the chicken rice and the prawn noodle stall. Most of these stalls are very authentic and almost worth the price.",

    "text": "After shopping in VivoCity, we were hungry and needed something to eat. We had passed by FoodRepublic, which is on the top floor, when we had taken the Sentosa Express earlier, so we decided to just stop by to eat here.I had also seen a Food Republic when I was in Hong Kong as well, but from what I know, it's simply just a food court, with not much in common (although they both had a Toast Box...). This one is designed like an old street.There are a lot of different food options, but from what I saw, they were all different types of Asian foods (e.g.: Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Thai, etc). There are also some drink stations available as well, although there are vendors pushing drink carts around as well.Since it was our last day in Singapore, I decided I just wanted some Chicken Rice, so I went to Sergeant Hainanese Chicken Rice, which is on the right side once you walk in.I ordered the Duo Set ($10.80), which comes with two kinds of chicken, veggies, egg/tofu, and a soup. They even gave us 2 soups since they knew we were sharing. The food was okay and plentiful, but around double the price of a similar set meal elsewhere (at least where I went). Also, for supposedly being 2 kinds of chicken, I couldn't tell the difference either by appearance or taste.Overall I wasn't too impressed. I didn't mind eating here since I was convenient since we were shopping, but you can definitely get better food at a cheaper price elsewhere.",

The amount of ingredients was decent and the soup was delicious. My friend had roasted duck rice and added roasted pork. The duck was tender but the pork was full of fat so avoid if it's not your kind of thing. There are also rave reviews about the mixed vegetables and Chinese handmade noodle stalls. Just don't get a shock when you find yourself paying $7 and upwards for a dish.",

    "text": "Mmm I like this place. This was my first experience dining on Singaporean cuisine. My friend and I spent the morning at Senotsa, which has a shuttle that connects to this place. We chose Food Republic since there are a million different options so you get a lot of variety depending on what you feel like eating. Lots of traditional local dishes for very cheap prices! We had the wanton noodles and hokkien prawn mee for lunch. Everyone is sold in small-large sizes which is cool. Ahh so yummy! I loved the wanton noodles and the hokkien prawn was quite good as well. They sell desserts on carts that are pushed around (reminded me of dim sum style) though you can also go to one of the stalls. For dessert, we had soursop ice and ice kacang, yum yum. Loved the soursop--it was the first time I've ever tried it.Basically, my Singaporean friend described this place as a hawker with AC. It has a bunch of different stalls selling different types of food, and then you just grab a seat. It was pretty crowded when we went around 1pm, but as we walked toward the back, there was a lot of empty seating. So if you go, be sure to walk around to the back if the front area is too filled. So much yummy food for a decent price (Though still higher than hawker of course) but then again you're paying a little bit more for the AC and comfort, so I think it's worth it. From the tourist perspective, it's a great opportunity to try a lot of Singaporean foods.tldr; great place great food, def worth going to if you happen to be in Vivocity.",

Not spicy at all the soup is very creamy \u00a0full of flavour of the sea. You get quite alot of prawn meatballs and fish that has been deep fried and into the broth. Also lots of chinese cabbage too. Add another ($2sd) you can have a choice of variety of noodles to compliment the dish from wheat noodles to flat rice noodles. The sauce on the right is fish sauce with hint of chilli and sauce on the left is chilli but with a hint of sour lime.",

I personally find this place better than the Wisma one. I find it ironic that hawker style food were demolished over the years and now we are desperately trying to recreate the same ambiance our grandparents and parents had in the 40s/50s/60s... with bright lights, less stuffiness and air con. But oh well, Gen X and Y kids like me were sold by the ambiance because when we were born here, these places seems to cease to exit already (Perhaps the only 'authentic' one left is the one along China Town road). I love Jessie's Rojak here. She has a black and white version of rojak with vegan options. The ba chor mee here is also nice. Frankly, I come here more for the rojak because she serves adequate rojak sauce to go with it. If you ask me to compare, I'll say her rojak is on par with the Hoover Road Rojak store at Whampoa food center sans the long queue at her store. But that is in my opinion lah. So do give her rojak a try when you are there, it's situated next to the BBQ chicken wing store.. she should be there reading a newspaper or a magazine when you walked by her store.",
