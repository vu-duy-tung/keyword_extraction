    "text": "Call me unadventurous but i REALLY like the Original HandBurger. There were so many times i consider giving it up to try other flavours but the medium beef patty is just too good for me to give up.The tender and juicy beef patty with caramelised onions is simply yummy. Choice of sides include Caesar salad, soup or fries. Looking for a good burger in a no frills yet accessible location, Handburger at Raffles City will be a great choice. I hope I'll muster enough \"courage\" to break away from the original and try other flavours too. :)*hint: If you love rich, creamy milk shake, do order 1. With the before 7pm 1-for-1 drinks promotion, it's really worth it!*",

    "text": "The Handburger is one of the stalls under the concept of Soup Spoon Union located in Raffles City Shopping Centre. The concept is not the usual \"Order and Pay later\" system in most restaurants, instead they did it the reverse with ordering and payment at the same counter.Once your order is ready, the buzzer will set off and you have to collect your food at the respective counters.The Handburger practices the healthy living where by the handcrafted burgers includes grilled 100% grass-fed prime beef patties and portobello mushroom sandwiched in wholewheat brioche buns.I had The Works containing cheese, mushroom, sunny side up egg, juicy thick cuts of tomatoes, handpicked butterhead lettuce and 100% grass-fed prime beef patty grilled to perfection. Making them a meal gives me an option of drink and choice of sides.The Works - $15.90 / SetIf you knows about Soup Spoon and had tried their soups, this Velvety Mushroom Straganoff should be of no stranger to you. Its stomach filling hot chunky mushroom soups is tastily great item to pair with the meal.The choice of drink was pretty interesting. Besides having the home brewed Iced Lemon tea, we have the Hibiscus and Sugar-Free Sakura Sencha.The healthy combination of chicken breast, portobello, cheese and honey mustard for the burger. Though the mushroom looked abit on the dry side, the overall taste was just not too bad.Another interesting item on the menu will be the Union Sampler that gives diner a petite caesar salad and two petitie mains - a soup and slider. The items was served on a wooden serving board that was tailored make to put both the plate and bowl into the sunken slot.Union Sampler - $12.50The original Slider was bite size, perhaps a few bites and you could have done with the burger. It consist of beef, cheese, grilled onions and honey mustard.Fresh greens with bacon bits, dried cranberries and croutons and vegetables were dressed lightly in its cream sauce.Overall, I like the concept as more choice are available apart from the usual Soup Spoon, however in terms of quality and standards, its quite of an average fare.",

Good, I tend to spend more time tasting burgers that are recommended so this already should sit in a higher league, but from the attitude of the Chef to the untested party seeping juices all over the plate to stacked onion rings filled with a horrible mayonnaise, this was miserable. Such a shame as the menu reads well and it has potential, but alas they have missed the mark.",

    "text": "The Handburger is a convenient place for a quick meal and being burger aficionados, we decided to order a bunch of burgers amongst us to share. The duck confit burger with orange sauce and snow pea sprouts and mandarin oranges came highly recommended and being gluttons at heart (and stomach), we plumped for The Works, which was basically a mad combination of 150g of beef patty with battered onion rings, bacon, egg sunny side up, grilled mushrooms and cheddar cheese topped off with aioli and barbeque sauce. We also got the battered dory to mix things up a lil bit, topped with spicy tartare and renkon crisps. They were all pretty decent although not spectacular, and all came accompanied with chunky fries and a choice of salad or soup. Being of the opinion that burgers should always come accompanied by milkshakes, we got the nutella with marshmallow and the peanut butter with banana to share ... they were really thick and decadent, so we were utterly sated.",

Little bit pricey but fairly decent, try the milkshakes if you have the stomach space for it... nutella with chocolate? chocolate with peanut butter? MMM. You can even take away if you don't have the time to sit down and eat!",

    "text": "The handburger does pretty decent burgers for a reasonable price. Set in a pretty casual setting, you don't have to worry too much about making a mess (because you probably will, with the size of their burgers).We went quite over the top with the chicken caesar burger and The Works. While the chicken caesar burger was just alright, The Works was pretty impressive. Built up with everything you can imagine, from mushrooms, onion rings, eggs and so on, it was one hearty burger to finish. The beef patty was succulent and juicy, and in a burger, that's pretty much all that matters. I also like their burger buns, which are a little sweeter than the usual.",

Recently they have changed their menu and the way you select your burger.Out of all the meat patties, the chicken, beef, pork and vegetables, I would recommend the beef patty. It is juicy and tender, a good mix with the jam will make it heavenly. It is so juicy that it just gets messy if you feast it with your hand. Bacon can be over cooked at times , leaving it too dry or burnt. The fries are great too and you have a choice of changing it to Caesar salad with some top up. Customer service level is good, proactive and responsive. \u00a0Price is affordable given the quantity and quality of food.",

    "text": "Amidst the many different varieties of food at Rafflescity, The Hand Burger stands out for its unique take on burgers. My favourite part of the burgers is the caramelized onion on the burger buns, or the interestingly green bun on the veggie burgers. The stuffed portobello burger was not bad, although the stuffing was a little strange in my opinion. I had the works which was a tower of patty, egg, onion rings, grilled mushrooms and bacon. The bacon was fried to a crisp and the onion rings still had visible rings of onion in it which is a definite plus in my book. However, I did not really like the fact that it was too tall to take a collective bite out of as I could not taste all the components together and make a better judgement of the burger as a whole. Perhaps if the buns were a little bigger, the burger would be shorter and wider. Also, I'd expected the flavour to be a little more special and while the creamy sauce went well with the caramelized onion and the fried components, it was not very interesting if not for the sheer volume of it. The mushroom soup was also far too thick and creamy, so it was left unfinished.The prices are of course a little more expensive than normal fast food ranging from about $13 to $18 without service charge. The service is not bad, and the burgers come with a side of salad, fries or mushroom soup. On the whole, I'd say it's a decent place for lunch although I would not specially go there to eat it.",
