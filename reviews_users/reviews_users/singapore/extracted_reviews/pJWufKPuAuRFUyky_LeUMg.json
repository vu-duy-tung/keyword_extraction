Great place to go for something simple, since there aren't lots of food selections.",

I also enjoy the generous truffle fries - if you're a truffle fan, you're in for a treat, they're not stingy with the truffle oil. I also enjoy the gourmet beef hotdog with ottoman topping (green tomatillo, carrot ketchup, diced tomato and sesame) - super yum. I can't wait to have a go at the the other flavours!As for the much-hyped coffee, it's not one of my faves - for the connoisseurs, the coffee here has a brighter acidity, which means, for the uninitiated, it has a slightly sour aftertaste. That doesn't make it bad, it's just that everyone's got a different palette for their idea of the perfect cup. But I do give them props for sourcing fair trade coffee, which means these beans were produced with the workers' conditions and welfare in mind, so the beans may cost more but its for a responsible cause.Final verdict: \u00a0Forty hands down one of the best foods in a place known for its coffee!",

    "text": "Primarily coffee for the connoisseurVery much part of Tiong Bahru's recent hipster renaissance, 40 Hands has always been about the coffee. It is a joint venture between Harry Grover and the Spa Esprit group, which explains why the decor is signature Spa Esprit's industrial chic, right down to the murals and roughly hewn stools and tables. The name comes from its philosophy of the third wave coffee movement, referring to how many hands the coffee bean passes through before it reaches your cup. As a responsible business, it ensures a direct provenance between the people who grow your beans and you - theoretically, this ensures these farmers receive fair trade for their hard work.But would you pay $4.50 for your coffee? That's not a very high price these days for premium coffee, and the java here is exceptional - for regulars, the baristas will know exactly your preferred blend, and will extract the perfect cuppa for you. Mine is always a flat white, with a bit of bright acidity (sour) to perk up the smooth blend. Foodwise, I like the truffled mushroom sandwich and will rarely venture past that.",

Their coffee is a bit pricey but its very smooth and strong (not like Starbucks) but my favorite here is the food. They have a nice selection of sandwiches, hot dogs, desserts and on weekends there is brunch. My favorite is the vegetable stack sandwich, served warm with roasted and grilled veggies and pesto. Their brunch menu is very reasonable and yummy. I tried the eggs with truffle and mushrooms, served with toast which was very satisfying. Their desserts are pretty great too. Try the dark chocolate tart--so good! Oh and they also serve some great Aussie beers! A nice place to chill and spend an afternoon.",

Using only organic beans, the coffee brewed here is strong and packs a punch. The d\u00e9cor is decidedly old school, and their food comes served in old tiffin metal plates. As part of the Spa Esprit Group, you'll find the desserts similar to what's found in HOUSE and Skinny Pizza. That said, the staff are friendly and efficient, waiting times are kept to a minimal. It's a perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of modern Singapore. The crowds here are also less boisterous and more of the type that comes in to have a coffee and read a book. A perfect addition for one of the most nostalgic and quaint parts of Singapore.",

I tried their Kong Ba Pau ($10 for 3 buns), and was very satisfied with the presentation and taste of it. Kong Ba Pau is one of the dishes commonly seen during Chinese New Year. So the cafe adopting this in their menu is very ingenious. The fatty-pork melted in your mouth and well-complemented with the fluffy white bun. 40 Hands is also famous for their coffee, which I did not get to try, and hope to go back one day to check it out, as well as the exciting places around the Tiong Bahru belt such as Social House and more.",

Much prefer the version at House though, which not only comes in a much bigger serving, but packs more of a punch with the crispy quinoa. If I'm not wrong, they're almost the same price too.More of a fun place to hang out, particularly in the courtyard at the back (too narrow and tight in the cafe itself), as part of the \"Tiong Bahru experience\". If I wanted better food, I'd probably head elsewhere. Probably the same for coffee too, since Singapore is not short of cafes serving good coffee these days.",

The food, however, was a little too hipster for us. I ordered salmon and hash, which was more like chunks of salmon and a couple potatoes in a creamy, heavy soup.

Due to my lack of coffee connoisseur skills, I'm just going to say that my cappuccinos have always turned out good!I did visit the cafe once with my husband during the weekend. They had this odd system in place, though- we had to wait to be seated, which led me to believe that they would have waiter service. However, this wasn't the case- we had to go up to the counter to order and pay, to which they gave us a number for the table. Despite the strange ordering system, we did enjoy our Asian sliders.I thought the cafe felt very cramped, but this may not be the case anymore as they just completed renovations during the latter part of March. Guess another visit is in order to see if there's improvement!",

    "text": "If I could put 40 hands together for 40 hands coffee, I would; But I don't have so many hands. Hah.Tucked away in a corner of Yong Siak Street, 40 hands is a respite from the bustle of heartland and downtown malls. My grandparents used to live in the charming Art Deco themed Tiong Bahru estate, and whenever we visited, one could feel the stoicism and tranquility that sets it apart from the rest. So when I went to this cafe for the first time, it brought back some good memories.Anyways, was introduced this place by Q (he is my trusty source of makan joints and whatnot), and we actually went there on the 3rd day of CNY, but it was closed when we got there. Unwilling to give up, the same group of us went again weeks later, and finally got to try their much publicized kopi! We sat at the little courtyard behind, which was seriously a tad too warm if you ask me. However, the aircon inside the main part of the cafe doesn't justify sitting inside, because it felt a bit stuffy there, so basically, I conclude that sitting at the seats outside (facing Books Actually) is the best. I know this to be true because recently, I went back again, this time with Ter, and we sat outside, right below a ceiling fan. Shiok.40 hands, like PPP and Loysel's Toy, is a champion of fair trade and sustainability in the coffee industry, so every cup of coffee that you enjoy, has gone through (in very civil service terms) the proper channels to get to you. There is nothing to complain about their coffee, though the second time when I went, I thought the acidic aftertaste of my cappuccino was a wee bit strong. But other than that, my friends and I have only good things to say about their coffee. Read from their website that their baristas undergo months of intensive training, so no blind button-pressing (that would be me and my Nespresso!). They have divine truffle fries btw! Much better than PS Cafe's, in my opinion.Even if you are not big on coffee, 40 hands is good for brunch and truffle fries as well. After a nice cuppa, you can take a stroll in the surrounding estate and infuse yourself in its nostalgic charm, or swing by Books Actually opposite; they have vintage knick knacks and classic Penguin paperbacks. And oh, remember to display sufficient parking coupon if you are driving. Apparently the parking aunties usually come out after 6pm, as advised by a resident of the estate. Caveat emptor wrt the advice!",

I felt the piccolo latte I had was a little over-extracted which led to a slight bitter aftertaste. But I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt as I believe it really depends on the hands behind the machine.I also picked out two dessert which were calling out my name. One - the orange peel pound cake and two - the chocolate tart. I was more impressed with their dessert as the pound cake had the delightful citrus twist I love in my cakes. The chocolate ganache in the tart was rich and luscious though it was a bit of a challenge to cut into the tart without making a huge din since it was made crunchier than usual.My friend had the truffled mushroom sandwich from the food menu which was delish from the bite I had. So I reckon their food and dessert menu is on the whole a good plus point for the cafe.Will be back to try their coffee and decide on this one again.",

I was there with two friends for brunch and the place was packed. As we order, some tables started clearing up and we were able to move to better seats. I ordered the Big Boy Breakfast and it was delicious. My particular favorite are the bacon, sausages and the fluffy eggs, which is how I like it when scrambled. The food was described as organic. Plus it was served with greens, mushrooms, flatbread and chili. For my drink, I got an Iced Mocha. It would have been a great place to chill place to study or work, if only there is WiFi connection. Otherwise, it's a great place to talk and hangout.",

I had the Mediterranean Lamb Sandwich. We paid $40 for 2 sandwiches+ truffle fries and 2 cup of coffee.

It is named so because apparently it takes 40 hands for a cup of coffee to be made. The shop itself is very small and very crowded on weekends with hipsters. The food itself is quite quirky as they sell everything from your normal ang moh salads and sandwiches to kong ba paus and local types of snacks. I had tried their eggs ben before (I think), and it was quite good. The coffee, I am not able to judge since I cannot tell good coffee from great.",

Rich in taste but not too overwhelming in terms of bitterness (they use Fairtrade coffee beans!) and added with the right amount of milk, I felt that it was just right for me. Coffee is something this place is popular for, so trying is believing! The Truffle Fries is also something to order here. One of the cheaper truffle fries around, it is nonetheless crispy and tasted great. Only the gourmet hotdog selections and certain sandwiches were available as we came on a Saturday dinner. The Big Bang is one of the gourmet hotdog. It is made with scrambled eggs, bolognese, sour cream and bacon accompanying the guinness beef and pork sausage. This accompanies well with beer (I was having coffee so I had skipped that) The Ang Mo Classic is also another gourmet hotdog which looked like a normal hotdog meal except that this came with cheese and gherkins and smeared with mustard and ketchup. You know what to have with for a complete enjoyment.Overall, this is a great place to come to if you are having brunch or a late night dinner around the area.",

Prices have definitely risen here, the food standards slipped, the staff (once a healthy mix of Singaporeans and foreigners) has since become an all-out Filipino cast (how did they manage that?).Made a recent trip there wanting to do some work, but I found that all the power sockets had been strategically 'blocked' by appliances, or hidden. Another huge pet peeve - if you're paying up to $15 for a mediocre sandwich and a coffee - I should expect a power point or two for a quick boost to customers' batteries, but no (I believe they used to allow this). Music was also blaring. The interior is still charming, the coffee's still pretty good, but I'm disappointed to see how the standards have slipped after the corporate buy-over.",

I said we could go anywhere provided there was air-conditioning since we been sitting outside Jumbo at the non-AC area. She went outdoor had no air-conditioning, but the inside the shops or cafes all have AC. I like ok, I not going to be a party pooper and besides I was curious where she was bringing me. My brother said he would come along too. He called for a Grab (somewhat like Uber) and off we went. Both started saying where we could go get some iced coffee. My sister suggested we could go 40 hands. When I opened the front door, it did not look like there were any empty table. My brother walked in and checked with the staff, and signaled us girls to go in. Apparently, there was another seating area all the way inside, almost like a level down. I quite like the rustic feel of this caf\u00e9.We were each given a menu and were told to place our orders in the front of the caf\u00e9 near the front door. After my iced mocha at Coffee Bean yesterday, i could not take another mocha. I ordered the iced chocolate instead. We also ordered the ondeh ondeh $9 cake and banana walnut cake $4.50.Our cakes and drinks arrived about the same time. My iced chocolate was really delicious. I assumed the hot chocolate version can rival the hot chocolate made by my favorite Starbucks barista.The ondeh ondeh cake was good but a tad rich, best to share it with 2 or more persons. The banana walnut cake was the best cake between the two. It was so moist and the flavor just spot on. I wish I can bake this cake at home and enjoy it with a cup of tea.Not sure I would make it back here again, I am just not familiar with many places in Singapore anymore.Still, I would recommend this place to anyone in this area :)",

    "text": "40 Hands are one of the veterans in the on-going gentrification of Tiong Bahru and I know I used to like it a lot. On my past visits it does however appear as if it has lost some of its charm and quality. The place is immensely popular on weekends so I usually go on weekdays but if going on weekends a good tip is to sit outside as the tables are usually available here and it does actually not get that hot as they are shielded from the sun and the inside is also not that cool since it is over-crowded and the air-con usually struggles the keep things cool enough.They serve up some standard cafe food here and I recall that used to have excellent food here but on my latest (last, perhaps) visits they have not really delivered the desired quality. The sandwiches with french fries have been mediocre at best and the french fries on several occasions the type you buy for almost nothing in the store and barely even fried (even sent them back once). The french toast with bacon and banana is not bad but it is by no means the best french toast you can have in Singapore. The main redeeming feature here is the quality of the coffee, the cold brew is excellent and they can also serve up some really good espresso based beverages. Unfortunately they do not serve any filter coffees but the coffee is what saves them from a 2 in rating as a place with this quality of coffee deserves a 3.",

    "text": "A thumbs up for Forty H4ands.We've been hearing of this place for ages and finally had the chance to try it out for ourselves. Being one of the pioneers of the ever changing landscape of Tiong Bahru, Forty Hands has done well to keep themselves ever popular. Located further inside Tiong Bahru at Yong Siak Street, Forty H4ands offers a pretty decent, yet streamline menu, choosing to concentrate on quality and not quantity. Unfortunately we didn't get the chance to try their signature \"Kong Bak Pua\" or \"Tau Sar Pau\" as we decided to try out their heartier breakfast selections instead. Big Boy Breakfast served with Pork SausagesA wide selection of goodies on a plate! The scrambled eggs (there's an option for sunny side up, eggs Benedict, over easy or scrambled) were very nicely done. Perfectly season, the eggs were nicely seasoned and probably one of the better done scrambled eggs ice had in a while. The mushrooms ragout and Beef Bolognese made a great addition, especially to stuff the pita bread with, along with the generous amount of fresh salad it was served with. Unfortunately, the sausage that it came with was... Well... Disappointing. While generous in terms of size, the sausage itself was hard and had a very very tough casing. Tasted as though it was cooked early in the morning but reheated and refried before serving. Not very good at all. A disappointment considering that the rest on the plate were really pretty good! Banana Bacon French Toast.Seems to be the trend recently, having extremely crisp bacon served with maple or in some sweet concoction. While that was great, the Banana portion was just a tad too little. Considering the size of the toast it comes with, a little more banana would have really given this dish more fulfillment but overall, it was still a pretty good french toast. Picolo latte This Is now my official \"let's see how good their coffee is\" drink. It allows me to taste just how good the coffee is, without taking it espresso. While the coffee is nicely balanced, it isn't THE best I've had so far, but, it's a good cuppa for those who don't want an overly strong or potent coffee. The beans apparently came from \"The Common man coffee roasters\" which to me, was pretty disappointing (food wise) but I suppose they did a pretty good job with the coffee.Overall, a great ace to meet with friends and it does have a pretty good breakfast. A bit on the pricy side but as compared to some of the other cafes out there, this one still serves a very satisfactory breakfast! Would have been perfect, if not for the sausage.",

    "text": "Two stars because (wish I could give 2.5):-this place gets, surprisingly, overcrowded during the weekends.-The food is ok but the value for money is low. I ordered the salmon and hash(=French fries!). There was very little salmon in the dish and while the sauce that came with it was very good it should have been on the side. What I ended up having was a few pices of salmon floating in a little bucket full of sauce. Not great and terrible for digestion.Pros:-Food presentation is nice.-Coffee is good (but slightly too acidic).-Lovely little patio on the back.Conclusion:A hype Tiong Bahru place that is over priced. Second time there and I don't understand why it gets so crowded.",

Been here like a gazillion times, complain about their coffee, complain about the prices, but still keep going back because I love their breakfasts!!! Oh so good, oh so pricy, oh can you please do something about your coffee (and I don't care that you are famous for your coffee ) So...breakfast for two with two cups of coffee would be a little less than $50... Ish. So... Ya.. Breakfast - can do no wrong. Eggs Ben (with really good hollandaise sauce) (comes with a great side of roasted potatoes), their poach eggs with mushroom, baby spinach (oh sooooo good) and a side of crusty bread and big breakfast (order one to share and regretted cos I could have finished one on my own). Well prepared breakfast with quality ingredients. Coffee - their milk based coffees are ok. Not THAT bad, just that I had better. The espresso and Long black are a bit too sour for my liking. Me no coffee expert but heard a SK told me before that it has something to do with the water temperature, while another SK told me it has something to do with the acidity of the beans * SK = Sien Ka (Cantonese) - go figure.....The place is always packed. Despite the prices (Singaporeans are rich eh?), people still flock in. I love that they open early (not very common for cafes around here), though they do close by 5pm.",

I ordered the Pesto Chicken Panini with a side salad (instead of fries) along with the Orange Carrot Juice. The most impressive part about the panini was its size, and the juice was fair (nothing impressive). The panini cost $17 and the juice cost $8. My friend ordered the Eggs Benedict with steak and the Truffle Fries. I will admit her selections tasted better than mine, but again, nothing special.Given how crowded it can get here during peak hours and how mediocre the food is compared to its price, I don't foresee myself coming back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Decent 3rd wave coffee place - the gleaming chrome Synesso machine assures you of a decent, if not stellar brew. Coffee is par for the course where 3rd wave is concerned - $4 - $6 depending on how much milk and water you want to desecrate your coffee with. Brews tend toward the brighter end of the flavour spectrum, as these places tend to do. Food is on the pricey end, especially considering that its located in a sleepy (but rapidly gentrifying) old neighbourhood - and all the associated good and bad that comes with that. If you're familiar with Spa Esprit Group's other F&B offerings - House @ Dempsey, Skinny Pizza etc, it's more of the same rustic-chi-chi vibe that tries to convince you that it's an organic, spontaneous, design-conscious place, whilst simultaneously charging you $16 for a mushroom sandwich drowned in synthetic truffle oil. If that's your vibe, you'll love this place. Me, i just come for the coffee.",

The texture was good and it's not too sweet. It crumbles nicely but gets a little messy cos you get crumbs falling out with every bite.If you are not fussy and just a quick take-away of beverage and pastry, guess it's not too bad a place.
