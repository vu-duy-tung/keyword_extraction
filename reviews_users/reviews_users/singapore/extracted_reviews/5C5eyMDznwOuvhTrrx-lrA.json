    "text": "Ramen was great! I had the Extremely Hot Ramen for $14.90++ and it was shiok! Beware! It's really quite spicy. There are 3 levels of additional spiciness and I selected the first additional level - Medium Hot. The ramen came with a large dollop of chili powder on the side and the soup broth was crimson. Whew! It was delicious but I think I wouldn't advance beyond the Medium Hot level. This was plenty hot for me!My wife and daughter had the house signature ramen ($11.50++) and it was pretty good too. The broth was thick and milky. May be a tad salty for some.The restaurant is small, with space for 12 diners in the area at the back. The bar counter sits another 6. There is an alfresco option as well, but with not very many seats. Credit cards accepted and you pay at the front cashier after your meal.Overall a nice dining experience and I'll be back for more whenever I'm in the area.",

I can definitely say, the best Ramen I ever had. extremely well balanced between sweetness, sourness, and smoothly hot. Your hand sending your spoon again and again, praying this moment will never stop, generously added soup for only 2$ more - guys, it is heaven! I can definitely understand why they got 5 stars.",
