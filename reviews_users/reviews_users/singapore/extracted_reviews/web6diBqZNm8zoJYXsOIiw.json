It appeared that we were the only Americans in the restaurant at the time. The chicken and rice was outstanding! We ordered a whole chicken, half boiled and half roasted. Both types of chicken were moist and tasty. The rice was also delicious. We also shared a pork chop which was outstanding. The restaurant is a short walk from many hotels in the area. The prices were very reasonable.",

The pricing (I think $4 for individual serve) is similar to those at food court but the portion is way bigger as it comes in 2 layers of meat on a plate. You get a miserly amount in food court. The chicken is flavorful and the breast meat is not that dry. The chili sauce is quite spicy so go sparingly on it. The grated ginger sauce is just ginger with no scallions or chopped green onions in it. The service is typical of coffee shop - efficient and brusque. There are other dishes available but I have yet to try any.",

Astounded by the crowd during dinner time, we walked into the eating place and tried to grab a seat. Lo and behold, there was a table for 2, just nice!Besides having good pork chop, they do sell Haianese Chicken Rice, Claypot Mutton Soup which I believe had been drawing the hordes thus its full house on a saturday night. The restaurant interior was simple and decent with hanging ceiling fans at each sector above. Chinese Lanterns were seen hanging from the florescent lights too.Haianese Pork Chop, being one of its Must Try on their Menu had been awarded for its Best Food for 2011 and 2012.It's not quite frequent we come across this dish on the menu moreover it had won the award. Having prepared similar dish, I would say that it was quite good but not really what I would expected. The dish was served with few pototoes wedes and boiled green peas with a bowl of tomato gravy.The piece of lean meat was fried to golden brown with crumbs coated evenly at its exterior. It was cut into smaller portions equally and was served.Braised Ee Mee tasted better than average. It's black braised sauce was aromatic and noodles was generously drenched, a little more would have the gravy overflowed.Having tried only 2 dishes, I would definitely be back for more when chance come!Total amount spend for 2 with drinks: $30",

In a traditional local coffee shop setting, Chin Chin Eating House sure looks like it goes way back. Studying in a nearby school, Chin Chin is an eating haunt for my friends and I. The dishes that we regularly order include chicken rice, Hainanese pork chops, Hainanese chap chye and claypot beancurd. The chicken rice has an authentic taste to it, and the chicken is blanched in cold water after cooking, making the skin smooth and the texture of the meat tender. Afterwhich, the chicken is served in a flavorful and aromatic sauce. The Hainanese pork chops here are passable but if you want a better version, try the one at Yet Con just across the street.My favorite dish at Chin Chin has to be the Chap Chye. The vegetables are fresh and crunchy and the sauce is the deal breaker. The sauce has a special oomph to it, which is provided by the dried cuttlefish strips I guess.",
