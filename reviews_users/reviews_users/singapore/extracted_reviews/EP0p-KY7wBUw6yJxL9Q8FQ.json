    "text": "It's a nice place to have a long dinner here and spend time with your friends catching up over food. Don't expect to be pampered like in an air-con restaurant, but what's a Mookata experience if you dont get to sweat it out in the heat, yah?The variety of the ingredients are decent and the serving is proportionate. It was a Friday night and my colleagues and I had been working really hard the past few months. So we took the opportunity to rant over dinner and catch up with one another. We managed to squeeze ourselves in the restaurant in time for 1 round of order before they came to check on last orders. Even though we stayed way way way past closing time, we werent chased away and the staff just cleared the necessary along the way. It's nice to finally not have to be bossed around. :)Beyond just the enjoyment of a good meal, I really appreciate their thoughtfulness in allowing us to indulge even though they have closed.",

    "text": "Came here on a Monday night with one companion, and got the $50 set to share. They do use charcoal, which is the norm, but oh golly - they got the amount of charcoal wrong a few times. The first time, they put too much, and there was too much smoke in my face. They removed our mookata very abruptly to change/remove some coal, and by the time we got it back, half our meat was burnt. Never mind. The second time they fiddled with the coal, they had to top it up. After so many customers, I should think the amount of coal to input should be tried and tested by now.The meats in the set were not well-marinated, nor particularly fresh, and the already-small scallops on shell were \"halved\" to save them some costs. Their chilli sauces were boring, and I just feel the whole experience was just sub par. Even their drinks were sub-standard! My friend's house-made iced tea was so over-brewed I got a full blast of tannins with one sip.I would not come back here. It is however a very convenient location if you live or work in the CBD I suppose.",

I am not a big fans of mookata, the Thai steam boat. However, the chicken tasted good. And we ordered the seafood egg and sambal octopus ... I love the egg. 4 pax with total bill $100+, I would say reasonable.",

This is my 2nd visit to this eatery and I highly recommend this place.The soup was delicious, probably due to the dipping pork lard. The marinated meat were tender and juicy. We ordered two packets of instant Tom yum noodle which was really good. Had a Thai ice tea which was below expectations. They offer other dishes apart from Mookata. Service is prompt and efficient. Downside to this place is the blazing heat, perhaps installing a few more fan would have been great.Wear light and be prepared to sweat it out while you savory this absolutely delicious BBQ meat. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Great place to enjoy a mookta at a really cheap and reasonable price! My friend and I ordered a combination platter for two. However, we changed all the meat to pork as recommended by a friend of ours. Cost us a total of 50++ for a huge platter of pork. The meat itself is very delicious! It seems to have been seasoned by some form of sesame seasoning and it really compliments the flavor of the pork! Really recommended if you're the type of person that loves just meat and rice!The mookta pot itself is placed smack in the middle of the table; dont think about having a proper conversation with that right in front of you. It's also very hot and at times, quite unstable! So please do be careful.Cooking the meat is first done by placing the given pork fat on the middle of the mookta pot. You do not rub the fat on the grill (remember the part about the unstable pot?). After the fat has melted, you're free to start cooking the meat! The only other problem would be the fatal buildup of the 'black burnt stuff' you normally get when cooking meat, so please watch out for that!",

    "text": "By nightfall, Tom Yum Kungfu is absolutely bustling. Thankfully, a friend had made a reservation earlier on in the week and we managed to enjoy a small table inside one of the air-conditioned shops. Mookata (Traditional Thai BBQ) is still a pretty new concept to me; it's almost like steamboat meets Korean BBQ! As much as I found this new concept exciting, I can't say that I walked away from Tom Yum Kungfu raving. I find their sets overpriced with little quality or value for money - we were given a few slices of beef, pork, 5 scallops and 4 prawns for $38. The Cha Yen (Thai MIlk Tea - $2.30 each) was beyond diluted, with the cups not even filled to the top. The $7 Pad Thai was really cheap, but unfortunately was a really pedestrian rendition. It lacked that awesome \"wok hei\" depth of flavour and neither the seafood, nor the chilli managed to shine through.No extra GST and a reduced service charge is a bonus - but beware of the involuntary wet tissue charge ($1.00)! Ultimately - I love the idea of Mookata, but I probably wouldn't come back for Tom Yum Kungfu again.",

I was nursing a horrible sore throat and went for the beef noodles - the only non spicy dish. The broth is flavorful and thick like how Thai beef broth is. A tad oily but still packs a good punch.For $9, the beef noodles came with a side of two spring rolls and a lemon grass drink.",

They had the best Steamed Seabass I had ever tasted, but for reasons unknown, they closed shop and no one knew where they moved. \u00a0one of the saddest days when I discovered they closed. I just happened to pass by Tom Yum KungFu during dinner time, casually flipped the menu to find something appealing. BOOM!!! They had the Steamed Seabass I have been craving for months. Had my doubts if it will meet my expectations, and the flavors were spot on, mouth-watering, tongue tantalizing spicy lemongrass flavor in very drop of the dish. It was one of my most satisfying experiences. I shall bring all my friends here.",

Instead of using butter to \"oil\" down our bbq grill, we were given lard cubes. PORK FAT LARD CUBES. UGH. The lard kept sticking to the grill and burning, resulting in our food tasting burnt. What saved this place was the selection of meat, seafood, and veggies that came with our set and that the broth wasn't too bad. BEWARE, if you're new to Singapore like me, they charge for using wet napkins. Uh, if it aint complimentary, don't put it on my table!",
