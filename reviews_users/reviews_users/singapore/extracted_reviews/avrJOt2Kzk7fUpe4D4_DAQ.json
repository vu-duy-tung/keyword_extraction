    "text": "Big fan of the yummy, creamy chicken soup. Love how tasty it is. I keep craving it, like they've added poppy flowers pods. I'm sure they don't, but there's some magic to their broth that you'll keep coming back for more, despite the long long wait.One day, I decided to have dinner at 5pm (just as operations begin) and I was lucky to get a table for two without lining up. YAY! The set comes at $25 a head and the serving looks miserable, but trust me, the portion is plenty for one. Broth is insane. Veggies are yummy. Don't care for the boiled chicken even though it's tender chicken. I just don't like the idea of boiled chicks. The meatballs are not yummy at all. Loved the thin egg noodles.One thing I could do without here? The service. The have rules on how you ought to eat the hotpot and will keep coming to you to tell you what to do. I mean, it is just hotpot isn't it? Then they won't allow you to pack the leftover soup/ food home. It's just their policy, they say. It's annoying! I paid for my meal and if I can't finish it there, why should I waste food and leave it? Ridiculous! So sucker or not, I'll still be returning whenever the craving hits (well, that's like once a week).",

What attracted me here is the word \"collagen\" on the advertisement in front of the store. The waitress are very friendly. Greeted us upon arrival. The store is small so depending what time you go, you might have to wait for a bit before getting seated.Flipped the menu and what attracted me the \u00a0second time is curry ramen. I've been missing the curry taste ever since I got back from japan last year for holiday. There were three types of noodles too and mochi mochi noodle attracted me the most for the two visits. The food came by 5 minutes later after barley tea is being served. The mochi mochi noodle is not too chewy or not too soggy. Just perfect. The soup base - in my case it was curry- was very delicious. The texture was just right. You need to walk to the front to pay the bill. Overall, it is a little on the expensive range for ramen but it is worth eating once awhile. Try it out :)",

However, Plaza Sing is not where I would like to roam around hence it was a pain! Hahah We were told we would be called between 7.30 to 8.30pm and I cling on to my phone like my dear life depended on it. The call came at 7pm and I was elated because I finally could sit down rather than roaming lousy mall. Simple order, just the collagen steamboat set for two. We watched our 'beancurd' turned into soup and had a sip at it. It was as flavourful as I was told. :) The waitress came by once the soup was boiling and gave us the soup in a cup. Warning, the cup had a strong metallic taste, hence it may change the taste you could have with your spoon. So, just scoop the soup with your spoon as much as you want!!! Next step, she would let you have the chicken meats (2 pieces each) and dumped in all the vegetables and whatsoever in steps I don't remember. The vegetables will change the taste of the soup. It was a great experience of collagen soup, but there is not enough meat for carnivorous me. There was some thin egg noodle to fill me up at the end. All in all, it was a great meal as I thoroughly enjoyed myself and would be back again whenever I crave for a youthful meal.",

    "text": "I'm generally not a fan of hot pot/nabe/shabu2. I feel that a lot of the weigh in these dishes lies on the quality of the ingredients. From the broth, to the food itself. And tbh, lately with the commercialized approach to restaurants, sometimes I feel that quality is sacrificed for profit.That was not the case for Tsukada Nojo. As mentioned by other reviewers here, the chicken broth was just absolutely amazing. It will probably be the most chicken-y thing you'll ever put in your mouth. Feels like there's a chicken farm in your mouth!And the stuffs you put inside the broth also had decent quality. Nothing that warrants any special mention, but they were good enough.One HUGE letdown to this place is that it doesn't take reservations. You pretty much have to show up at 17:30 - 18:00 in order to get a table immediately, or you'd have to wait for hours and hours. If you show up after 8pm, there's high chance you won't get a table at all.",

And we had it with less salt as the waitress offered. Also tried the original flavor onigiri.Yes, the broth is different. Richer than those done with chicken, but I don't like it as much as the classic tonkotsu broth. The condiments has:1. yuzu zest (interesting but I can do without it)2. veggies (hmmm)3. egg (yes with runny yolk but nowhere close to what I consider a proper onsen egg)4. Grilled chicken (much like a teriyaki chicken but served at room temperature and oh so sweet. Too sweet and dry and tasted like frozen chicken)Thin egg noodles is nice and thin but the noodles get soft too quickly as the broth is served very hot. Thus halfway through, I am already disliking it.The onigiri is forgettable.It is an ok bowl of ramen, but pales so much in comparison to the real ramen places out there. Maybe coming for the hotpot is the right thing to do.",

    "text": "For pictures and full reviews, visit my blog!I've heard about Tsukada Nojo Bijin Nabe Japanese restaurant sometime back. I think it appeared under the beauty section of the magazine rather than the food. This skinnyfat girl here is not yet concerned about wrinkles on her face and gelatinous animal parts kinda scare me a little; hence i've only recently tried Tsukada Nojo. For $25 per pax, you'll get to enjoy the Bijin Nabe a.k.a. Beauty Pot with a variety of ingredients. These beancurd looking pudding are actually solidified collagen, which would melt to reveal chunky pieces of chicken, and also disintegrate into the tasty chicken broth. We didn't know that the Bijin Nabe was only served during dinner so we were left with only the ramen option. We haven't tried the one in Japan so there isn't a baseline for comparison, but i must say that the soup was really tasty with a tinge of stickiness (probably the collagen). S had the thin springy noodles with his chicken ramen and I must say that this is waaaaay better than Marutama's. I really enjoyed my Curry Ramen with the thick Mochi noodles. It's the slightly curly and yellow Sapporo kinda ramen but with more chewiness. I love that the curry is really thick and flavorful and more savory than the usual sweet and mild Japanese curry. If you like rich flavors, this comes highly recommended. The dry looking roast chicken slices served on the side surprised me with the light honey flavor and the tenderness of it. Eat it alone or warm it up in the sauce before you devour them.Our supposed starter Nikumaki Onigiri, each the size of my fist, were served when we were halfway into our ramen. There's no way we would be able to finish the 2 huge bacon wrapped baked rice balls/rolls after our ramen and had no choice but to bring one home. This is more of a sweet dish than a savory one so it may not appeal to all. I heard that the chicken wings are pretty swell. Shall try that with meal when my curry ramen craving kicks in.",

    "text": "I came here for the beauty collagen hotpot. No, really. And it was AMAZING.Okay, it looks pretty scary - slabs of off-white jelly, neatly cut, piled high in a hot pot. The server turns on the power, and in that same minute, you see that jelly start to melt away, just like the worries of the world...It's almost like a ritual: you watch it melt into a broth, and the server comes over and ladles some into a sake cup for you to sip. At first I was SUPER hesitant. After all, it's collagen, and collagen is made of... I don't really know, I just cringe a little when I don't know, but I thought, what the heck, I'm already here. And then I saw rainbows, and unicorns and dancin-- never mind. It was pretty spectacular, I'll tell you that. The flavour was so rich, yet not so much so that it made you uncomfortably full. It... has to be tried to be understood.You order in portions for how many people are present, but you might consider under ordering by one pax per table, so you can try some of the other dishes. What I mean is that you might order a 3-person portion of hotpot food at $25 per head and share that lot, so you can order some of the sides. I recommend the onigiri - there's one wrapped in bacon, and you can never go wrong with that one. (:There's an instructional video playing outside while you wait, so you should be pretty well-schooled in what order to put the food in your hotpot, though I'm not entirely convinced there needs to be an order. I supposed I had that memorised from the sheer number of times I watched it while waiting... that's another story. The wait is pretty nuts, so go before 6pm if you can, otherwise the waitlist gets filled REALLY quick, and you might have to wait 2 hours. That's my story anyway.",

    "text": "The feeling of a returning patron is always forward looking because I knew what to expect from the famed Tsukada Nojo under the AP Company. With my first experience, they left me with little room to question on the quality of their ingredients and service delivery. Although the long wait has been one nagging issue to some, today I wasn't greeted with a long queue. The divider is still there except the fiery snake that has frequent the outlet has went into hiding. At 1pm, I am 3rd in line. I then realized that the crowds were in fact, packing the dining space and I postulate it has to do with the quick table turnover and quality wait service that are causing the shorter wait outside.Holding the red leather booklet in my hand, I felt its familiarity. As I flip along, I was beaming. BIJIN Ramen is the reason that brought me here in the daytime - Tori Nikomi soba - soba noodles in JIDORI Chicken Stew (thickened soup). There are 4 types of soup base to choose from; Salted (Chef recommended), Shoyu, Curry and Spicy Hot. Pairing up with a few classes of soba; Thin Egg Noodle, Thick Mochi Mochi Noddle and Rice Noodle. I have had the thick mochi mochi when I ordered the Bijin Nabe (Beauty Pan) previously, hence I went ahead to pick its cousin - thin egg noodles for my Shio Tori Nikomi - S$16.80++.Arrives fairly quickly, the components - Roasted Chicken Fillet slices, 1/2 Ajitsuke Tamago, generous portion of Leeks, blanched green vegetables, 2 huge crispy Seaweeds are served separately, while the soba sleeps soundly in the warm collagen chicken soup underneath. A neat presentation and I was given the liberty to add most if not all the ingredients to compose my ramen dish. Well, I had all of them in though I know some may not like leeks in theirs. I love the way the tamago was done, the soft wobbly white was seen cuddling its jellied lava yoke that dissolved instantly in your mouth. The winning taste in the yoke was a lifetime. The roasted chicken was tender & juicy, the distinctive marinades that shine the surface of the skin lends a good gentle sweetness to the meat, very lovely. The huge seaweeds were satisfying but nothing beats the egg noodles that were soaking up the rich silky chicken soup base with a magnificent saltiness in it. The briny taste wasn't too overwhelming but was comfortably acceptable. The egg noodles were slimmer than the thick mochi-mochi, and its smooth strands mop up the soup very well. Unlike the chewy mochi mochi noodles, this egg noodle was delicate in nature yet springy. My palate embraced the dish eagerly.I decided to whack the teasers, leaving no rooms for the desserts today. The nibbles not to be missed - \"Maximum\" Potato - very well-received in Kyushu. A basket of pencil-thin golden fried potatoes were sprinkled with black pepper spices and lightly salted. Missing the X-factor at first sight? Well, looks is always so deceiving. I would be deeply regretted not having this. The potato has a unique buttery taste in them, not by seasoning but genetically on its own. I was told these spuds are flown in from Japan, just the way you tasted a home-cooked imported Japanese spuds bought from Isetan Scotts or Media-ya. Crispy with a touch of tenderness internally, so moreish and you just couldn't stop eating them for a reasonable S$5.50++ along with an animated bird smiley ketchup & honey mustard dipping sauce.For a more hearty teaser, try Nikumaki Onigiri, sesame mixed Japanese rice wrapped in numerous soft white bacons. The Yuzu Peppered Mayo version - S$3.50++ fared better than its Plain Nikumaki Onigiri - S$3.00++. Anyone who loves pork belly will find these starter pleasing. Apart from the gigantic glistering structure, I'd hope the bacon has a more charred elements, or perhaps my taste buds are geared towards English-style and so a more grilled and crisp nature will be hyped up. The unseasoned rice, like its unsalted bacon partner did not make any lasting impression on its own but the Yuzu Peppered Mayo variant did stand out from the Nakumaki clan. The citrus adds flavour to the pork and help to mask the wildness in the meat, also warding off any disagreeable feel from the belly fats. Choose a flavoured Nikumaki unless you have a very light palate.DO note: ramen is ONLY available for lunch while Bijin Nabe - Beauty Pan during dinner. I have a friend who missed the timing to a beauty pan, and I hate to see that happen to you! So, please enjoy.",

My friend and I were slurping it down bowl after bowl. The produce that they offer was a-okay. The prawns are good if you don't over cook it, but I like the wintermelon and I love the mochi noodles as well. The soup makes the meal, so if you are not a big fan of soup, you will not appreciate this as much. The chicken meat served with the soup is super tender and juicy as well. Yum! :)",
