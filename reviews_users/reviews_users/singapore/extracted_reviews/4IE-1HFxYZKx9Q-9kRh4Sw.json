With this said, I truly enjoyed this meal. \u00a0Obviously one does not come to an establishment expecting large portions but his made me cherish every biteAs is typical, I was challenged to make my selections because everything looked so good.I started with the roasted eggplant and red pepper soup which was quite good. However, I have a feeling the classic French onion would have been a better selection.For my main course I selected the wagyu tenderloin topped with pan fried foie gras (which melted in my mouth with every bite). My largest disappointment comes in what I did not order. After eating I realized there was one more item in the specials that I'm sure would have been excellent. It is white asparagus season and it is flown in fresh in from France - I love white asparagus!For dessert I chose cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was also quite good. \u00a0My only critique is that the serving was quite thin. \u00a0As a result, the sugar overpowered the very tasty vanilla creme. The same portion size would have been fine had it \u00a0been in a smaller but deeper serving cup.",

    "text": "First time dinner at Bistro Du Vin. Nice pleasant ambience. Very French Bistro. Service was very good but then it was a slow night on Thursday. We ordered foie gras, scallops, escargots and their special gravlax. Outstanding was the gravlax. Unfortunately it's not always available. The escargot was a disappointment with bits of grit. The mains were all very good. Best was the confit of suckling pig belly. Which was crisp and meltingly tender. Again preorder if you want this as this sells out fast. We finished with a brace of desserts, all well done. Overall a very nice dinner. Larger than normal portions, value for money and highly recommended. A great place to bring a first date as the atmosphere is unthreatening and relaxing. Had a good time.",

Our waitress was friendly and not pushy.Wine - they have reasonable wine by carafe. Two thumbs up!Food: Pan fried foie gras is great. Not the best I've tried, but the best were in restaurants that cost many times of here. So I would gladly eat the one here again.Daily special of butter poached pink trout - so so good. the trout is deboned and so succulent and tender. Perfectly cooked and not dry. Add the french beans and toasted almonds, it has a wonderful combination of taste and bite. Love this dish!Daily special of mussels in white wine sauce - the white wine sauce is great, very flavorful and a good amount of wine taste, garlic and many other goodies. However, the mussels were way too tiny! they looked so shrivelled and sad that I think it totally did an injustice to the wonderful broth.Grand Marnier souffle - 20min wait time, but so worth the wait. Exactly how a good souffle should be. Order it.",
