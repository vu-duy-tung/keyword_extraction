Freshly-made piping-hot waffles with rum&raisin ice cream is heavenly - a definite must try.I'm used to a much heavy taste of Spiced Chai Latte so I was surprised that this was pretty light on the taste buds. Significantly missing was the taste of cinnamon which only came as an aftertaste that was barely there. Well, the drink grows on you I guess as I felt quite satisfied after I finished my cup.Absolutely love the fact that its a closely-knit family-run business. The cafe was empty save for the staff/family at 730pm but started to fill up pretty quickly from 745pm onwards!Will be back again... this weekend perhaps!Don't recommend this to your friends, let's keep this a secret shall we?",

The 3Egg omelettes are also very fluffy and almost liquidy on the inside!Update 26th sept 2014: so now that it's my 3rd time here. I decided to try the ultimate combo and it's delicious! The bacon smelt so good, it would make anyone hungry! The pancakes were just as good.. They may look like normal pancakes but just wait till you put them into your mouth! It's so fluffy and tasty!! The Rosti with cheese sausages for $12.90 is a good price and the Rosti is delish! I did have to tell them to cook with less oil as the last time I had it.

So I guess the crowd are pretty refined (albeit young). They serve up Yahava Koffee here so fans of Yahava KoffeeWorks can enjoy a nice cuppa here though they wont have the full Yahava selection here. I'm really not a coffee person so am just happy to settle with a nice cup of fragrant Chai Latte. Didnt had too much time to try the mains but I managed to grab a bite of their plain pancakes. It's a little pricey at $6 for 3 plain pancakes only, at $7 or more, you could try their Banana Pancakes or the Tolido Pancakes that comes with sausages. The pancakes are soft and fluffy, nice texture but still lacks a little bit of the richness compared to those that you'll get at McDs.They have breakfast all day menu and pasta mains. Simple cafe with a good variety. Staff are really friendly and nice. Would not hesitate to go back to try more food from their menu soon!",

    "text": "Of the 'Hdb neighborhood cafes' that I've visited, Tolido's Espresso Nook is one that left an impression (a good one). Tucked in chaotic Crawford Lane among local coffee shops and singlet-wearing ah peks, and aunties hawking random stuff at void decks, this cafe juxtaposes with a relaxed and chic vibe that would warrant a repeat visit. I love the fluidity in the different spaces, loosely separated by the low coffee bar and the floor to ceiling glass panes that act as invisible barriers to the alfresco area. All-day breakfast is served here for all you breakfast eaters! Pancakes, eggs, toast, waffles and small pastries are available all day err day and there's no need to wait for the weekends. I decided not to be greedy and went with the Tolido's Pancakes ($9.90) which comes with 2 fluffy pancakes, streaky bacon and egg (sunnyside up). Typically, the greedy me would have ordered the Ultimate Combo ($11.50) which includes 2 chipolata sausages, and more eggs, on top of the basic pancakes but well it's quite a substantial portion already. The pancakes, while fluffy, were still kinda moist and sticky inside. A distinct milky flavor could be tasted and I liked that the batter was slightly salty. I topped up $2 for scrambled eggs instead of a sunny side up. The eggs had a nice height to it and was poofy like a cloud. It could be a little more funny but it was still decent.S had the Waffle with Ice Cream ($10.50) which came with a choice of a single scoop of ice cream, sprinkled with freshly baked crumble and drizzled with your choice of sauce on a thick waffle. If you like a crunchy waffles, this would be up your alley but I thought it was a little more like a biscuit i.e. dry. \u00a0The generic but sufficiently rich chocolate ice cream helped to moisten the batter a little but did not make the dish spectacular. If you want something more substantial, Tolido's also does pastas and sandwiches at reasonable prices ($10.50 onwards). I would love to try the Croque Monsieur, only because i love the french ham and cheese sandwich. Now now, Tolido's also serves really good and pretty coffee. Yahava coffee blends are used here and the medium roast was fragrant and smooth with a low acidity. Head barista and owner Douglas Tan was the third place winner in the 2014 Singapore Latte Art Competition and that explains the photogenic cuppas.Do not miss the Salted caramel latte. The flavor was well blended into the drink and every sip was a velvety mouthful with the perfect amount of salt. Yums. Adding to my list of favorites because of their salted caramel latte and lovely space!",

It was still buzzing with the lunch crowd but emptied out pretty soon after \u00a01.30. My stack of three Pandan pancakes were good. Fluffy with a whiff of pandan, they were great with the ice-cream and Gula Melaka drizzle. I had the perfect Salted Caramel Latte too- smooth, milky, and rich enough to leave you wanting. I like that unlike some cafes, they have their act together - AND the staff are smiling. Win. (And TIP if you're impressed ok. That's how we spread the love!)",

Who can't resist a charming neighborhood hangout that boasts a top-notch Barista and a kitchen that can whip up a seriously good breakfast meal (not to mention an assortment of pastas).I went here with my wife for our usual Sunday brunch where we normally try to recover from a night of going out by eating a filling breakfast. I ordered the Banana Pancakes (Yum!) while my wife ordered the French Toast (Double Yum!). What stood out to me was not just the great taste and the beautiful presentation, but rather the intangibles. Specifically, the soul and love that was put into each dish and each cup of coffee made for that matter. It definitely brought me back to that feeling when my parents used to serve me banana pancakes when I was a young boy. So much can be said of Tolido, but I'll some it up by these select adjectives: welcoming, charming, neighborly, pleasant, and cozy. Did I mention the All Day Breakfast!!! Count me in! Kudos to Douglas for introducing himself to my wife and I and making us feel at home.",

Eggs came in over buttered and nothing special, no cheese in them or any other additional ingredient. Menu misses yoghurt or muesli for breakfast... Waited 25 mins for a coffee, they forgot about our order. It seems as if the place was ran by some young punks that lack order. There's about 3 waiters they Kept coming asking what we ordered. Not only is but the table next to us as well. the coffee is actually good! Bitter than smooth but the fluffy milk balances out the Flavours well.Inside is too crowded and small for my liking and disorganised. Especially at the entrance where water filler is placed and tables, can't get through... I might be back but only because it's close to my house. Rating three only because of the coffee else this would get two... p.S. For those that rated this 4 please go to Ronin.... Stay true to yelp!",

They seat you with the menu and you place your order + pay at the front.With a ton of breakfast, caffeine, and non caffeine options, it took me a while to finally decide. I needed my morning fix of caffeine so I played it safe and got the americano. Bro got the iced peppermint mocha. For food, we got the ultimate combo and the truffle scrambled eggs.Drinks came quickly within 5 minutes. The americano was strong and awesome, just what I needed to start my day. Bro's iced peppermint mocha was amazing too. I'm typically not a fan of those fancy iced capp type drinks, but it was really good!!Bro's ultimate combo arrived first, and my scrambled eggs came few minutes after. The cheesey scrambled eggs with few chunks of veggies and strong taste of truffle was to die for. Every bite tasted like I needed another bite. The toast was decent but I didnt eat much. The salad was very lightly dressed, really appreciated that. The potatoes in the corner were not deep fried - really helping with my eat-healthy diet here!The servers here were all super polite and nice.",

And, the pancakes are flawlessly fluffy. I got the cappuccino to wash it sown (ahem, both times I've been). The staff are also very sweet and attentive. I've been on a Sunday each time and despite the full house of customers, I haven't had to wait for a spot to sit.",

    "text": "After the giant surge of cafes opening up in Singapore in the past 2 years, I confess I have been biased against cafe food, because they tend to be a standard cookie-cutter menu in some sort of hipster backdrop.We came here on a public holiday for lunch, and waited about 10 minutes for a place for two, inside. We ordered an ice blended chocolate, an ice blended coffee, strawberry cream cheese pancakes, and bratwurst on a rosti. Oh man, I do love the food here. The food here didn't take too long, and the drinks were decent and not overly sweet, and they do ask if you want whipped cream on or off your ice blended drinks. The cream cheese pancakes are two giant fluffy pancakes with A LOT of cream cheese custard filled in between the two, and strawberry sauce drizzled all over. I am glad we got a savory other dish, because we were sugar-overloaded, but happy nonetheless. The crispy rosti really deserves a special mention, with two bratwursts, a fried sunny-side-up, and sour cream. Would be even better with green scallions on top, but this is as good as it gets!I would come back. Again and again.Oh, and free wifi.",

The barista was also very friendly, taking the time to explain what a kopi latte was and recommend some choice picks at the cafe. Apparently, the barista came in third at a Singapore latte art competition. As we were stuffed, we did not order any food but we saw many orders for the pandan pancake which looked sumptuous. We'll be back to try that. The place was doing a roaring trade on a Sunday afternoon.",

Located at an HDB block about an 8 minute walk from both Lavender and Bugis MRT stops, Tolido provides fantastic all day breakfast items along with a robust pasta menu. With most menu items priced between S$10-15, I left the cafe feeling full and satisfied. They also take reservations over the phone, which makes getting a coveted spot indoors very feasible. Will definitely be coming back again to try some of the other items on the menu.",
