But it's all worth it, because they definitely make the best fresh noodles in Singapore - so springy It energises! This mee is for me lah! Did the chefs who knead the dough undergo the same training as the master therapists who knead your feet at Footworks next door?",

Soup came with a piece of turnip, hint of taste of prawn. Prawns were sliced at the back and one would have thought they will take out the shit as well but, alas, not always. Too many strips of prawn crackers. They should just serve it on the side.Giant wonton (x3) - too much skin and I could taste the oil. Won't order again.Noodles are good and will go back when I crave for noodles.",

    "text": "Maybe this should be 3.5 stars. I like the noodles but I am not crazy in love with it. I have walked past this place many times whenever I dined at The Ship which is just next door, and it is always (still is for now) quiet with only a few (or none) tables occupied. As fate will have it, I happened to see two friends posting pics and raving about this place on different days but in a week, so that got me interested. Especially when one Indo friend said it is very similar to chicken bakmie which is my all time favorite Indo noodle dish. I had that and the noodle was very springy and it was a close replica. All that was missing was kecap manis. It was a generous bowl with lots of chopped chicken, juicy mushrooms, veggies, fried onions and pretty small pieces of lard. So yummy. The soup was slightly sweet and was a bit thicker than the usual clear soup. During lunch time, you can create your set with a \"add-on\" for extra moolah. One add-on per noodle bowl. I had the pebbles which were fried sweet potato balls. They were nice but not really my type of dessert, too chewy like mochi which others may like. The highlight of this place would be the fact they made their own egg noodles and apparently they sourced their ingredients from the wet market so sometimes certain items would not be available if they did not manage to buy the ingredients. Service was good with friendly and helpful staff. Just write your order on the chit provided and pay at the cashier. They only accept cash, so do stop by the ATM before heading over. It can add up to a hefty amount if you order more sides and drinks. Things I will want to try next time - giant fried wantons, fried chicken wings, meatball soup, lemongrass soda and avocado drink.",

The place has an open dining in concept.The restaurant has weekday set menuwith a topup menu.Weekday Set Meal ($9.90)Today the restaurant is having a weekday set meal which consists of My Chicken Noodle, one small salad and one soda. This all is for just $9.90 nett, which sounds like a great deal.My Chicken Noodle (usual $7.90)The noodle has a QQ texture, which reminds curly, hard, not as springy as the usual wanton type. It is made fresh daily in Indonesian style. Chilli paste is served separate in the spoon. If that is not enough for you, there is sliced chilli on the table to help yourself to. The noodle comes with a bowl of soup with a slice of radish in it. The soup is a bit too peppery.SaladThe spinach is dressed in light dressing and tastes light and crispy.Sago Pudding Dessert ($2.50 topup)Although there is a topup menu, the female staff at the counter refuses to let me topup. She says that she will charge me for ala carte prices should I wish to do so, although I have showed her the menu. In the end, I have to wait for a change of staff at the counter before sucessfully getting my request. So troublesome. The sago is light and does not taste too sweet with the gula melaka syrup.Overall the food is not bad except for my bad experience with the female staff.",

    "text": "Whenever mentioning about Chinese cuisine, stir-fried noodle is always on our top picks. Around the Orchard area, there's a restaurant known for its non-MSG noodle: I Want My Noodles. I Want My Noodles is located inside Shaw Theatres. The dining place looks impressive thanks to its eye-catching d\u00e9cor with dreamy eye-bulbs hanging from the ceiling.We ordered their must-try dishes: My Noodle With Double Roast and My Lor Bah Noodle (thumbnail photo). The noodle strings are chewy, thinly shaped and not too oily. The chef had beautifully mixed in his secret sauce, resulting in a well-balanced noodle bowl. Charsiu meat was cooked perfectly, making it extremely soft. We especially love its sweetness and fragrance. The roasted pork was even more amazing. It was roasted twice, resulting in super crispy roasted skin. Our pork belly was also amazing- tender and melt-in-the-mouth. For vegetarian , Mushroom Noodle is a tasty and very affordable option.Recommendation: My Lor Bah Noodle (#1 on the menu), My Noodle with Double Roast (#2 on the menu)Read our Singapore Food Guide, visit us at : thecoupleeats.com/singap\u2026",

    "text": "Before writing this review and eating it on the same day, I've tried this place a total of three times - 2 takeaways & 1 dining in.Came here on a Thursday around 11.30 am. Managed to avoid the lunch crowd. I'll give a review of what I've eaten so far.For takeaways, my mother normally take a metal container with her to contain the noodles and the ingredients to prevent the noodles from sticking in a lump. I always asked her to get me the chicken mushroom noodle as I am a fan of any kinds of mushrooms. Eating at home is different as the fried flour on the side was soggy at the time I was about to consume. I also tried the fried wantons. They were alright for me. The takeaway portion was reasonable for my consumption.During my dine in session, the Christmas promotion of crispy duck noodles was still on. Hence I got that thinking it would be similar to the crispy duck like the ones I had in Bali. I also had a side of sago pudding with gula Melaka base and coconut flakes sprinkled on the top. The noodles reminds me of the Khek noodles I had in Medan. It is springy and a texture that reminds me of my childhood. And the homemade chilli sauce on the bowl of noodles made the dish more spicy - to my liking. No complains on the noodles and the chilli sauce on the side.For the duck, the skin was crispy but the meat was not soft. Was a little disappointed with it but the garlic and chilli sauce on the stone bowl made increased the taste - sour and spicy mix. The fried tofu with vegetables in the inside was a little disappointing. Was oily and a little bit tasteless. The dessert (no picture) that I got was not one of my favorites either. Even though I like the mix of sago and gula Melaka, the texture and the combination of sweetness was not too impressive.Price wise it was reasonable especially when it is located at shaw center. Lighting was a little too dark - hence the color of the pictures did not turn well. Overall I will be back for its noodles. Will probably try different meats another time ;)",

The chilli is pretty potent and masks out most other flavours. The mushroom noodles was quite interesting with a few types of mushrooms thrown in the mix, but after adding the same said chilli, both types of noodles had an all too similar note.The fried chicken wings come with a bit of chilli to dip the wings into, but very little of it sticks onto the chicken. It would've been much better to have had the wings marinated in the chilli.I Want My Noodle is marketed as being made by noodle craftsmen, making fresh noodles everyday. The noodles look like they come straight out of an instant noodle packet and is not distinctive enough from those to make an impression in terms of bite or flavour.All in all, you could eat here and you could be reasonably satiated if you want something to eat. But it's so unremarkable I probably won't return.",
