    "text": "This is a review of lunch with a colleague at Spize Supper Club. \u00a0I actually do not know if there is a difference between Spize Supper Club and Spize Mediterranean Grill. \u00a0There are two signs outside but it seems to be more like one place.tinyurl.com/apmvuqtThe ambiance is half restaurant and half hawker. \u00a0It has a menu and service like a restaurant. \u00a0But it has a large outdoor seating area more similar to an outdoor hawker. \u00a0It is well ventilated. \u00a0 So, the heat was not actually very bad at all.tinyurl.com/albevd9I will also note the open kitchen areas are extremely clean and organized.tinyurl.com/b2azc5jtinyurl.com/apvw65xThe service is pretty straightforward. \u00a0They take your order and bring your food. \u00a0There isn't much more to it than that. \u00a0I would say the staff is professional and polite but not outwardly friendly.The food was very good. \u00a0At least mine was.Chicken Fajitas - I love steaming and sizzling plates of food. \u00a0These fajitas certainly delivered on that. \u00a0The core ingredients for fajitas were there. \u00a0There were onions and peppers. \u00a0They were well prepared. \u00a0However, it would have been easier to construct the fajitas if the onions had been sliced instead of left as rings.There were also tomato wedges. \u00a0This was a new one for me and fajitas. \u00a0There were a couple of flour tortillas. \u00a0I could have definitely used one more. \u00a0Then there was the chicken. \u00a0This was a little different from most fajita presentations. \u00a0It was not sliced. \u00a0Plus, it was mostly dark meat. \u00a0It was very tender though and worked very well. \u00a0tinyurl.com/au24wxvThey provided condiments. \u00a0There was salsa and guacamole. \u00a0Neither of these really stood out. \u00a0They didn't seem any better than what you might buy pre--prepared from a store. \u00a0There was also a creamy white cheese. \u00a0This is a departure from the yellow or white hard cheeses often associated with fajitas.tinyurl.com/a3s6dvzIt all came together well and I thoroughly enjoyed my fajitas.Mediterranean Lamb Salsa Sizzling Grill - My colleague ordered the lamb. \u00a0It also looked impressive and was sizzling away. \u00a0However, he only gave it a mild ok/thumbs up. \u00a0I think the term he used was \"decent\". \u00a0I tried the mashed potatoes with gravy and thought they were pretty good.tinyurl.com/axma5bjOverall - I enjoyed my lunch experience at Spize and would not hesitate to return and try other things. \u00a0I also think it might be an interesting place to have a dinner and cold beer in the evening.",

It's always crowded but they always have a good system going to make sure everyone does not wait too long. Also the menu has more to offer than just Muslim food. They also have indian, western, Mediterranean and the local dishes on the menu. And it's also halal. Hence it's perfect if you have Muslim friends with you.",

    "text": "Think about having supper in the East, and the first place that comes to mind will be Simpang Bedok. Spize Supper Club is nestled amongst a stretch of halal eateries that all open till the wee hours. The place is usually the most crowded during dinner and suppertime, or when there is a soccer game being aired. There are 2 separate sitting areas - one is 'indoors' under a makeshift tent and the other is outdoors by the roadside. I prefer sitting by the road because its breezier and more comfortable, a better place for chilling with friends. The indoor sitting tends to get a bit stuffy. Looking at their extensive menu, ranging from Western to Local delights, it can get pretty mind-boggling deciding what to order. Here are some of their best dishes - Roti John, Chicken Shawarma Wrap, Maggi Goreng, and of course what they are well known for, Roti Prata and Murtabak. Lastly, your meal will not be complete unless you order their most popular drinks like Bandung, Milo Dinosaur or Teh Halia.",

    "text": "One of the best places in the East of Singapore to have supper! Spize has been a favourite since I first visited the place. The really casual and chillaxed atmosphere you get from hanging out at a prata joint is something that's really hard to beat. And somehow their kind of food is the thing that will satisfy your supper craving.Everytime I come here I will definitely make it a point to have the Roti John which is their house specialty. It comes stuffed with mutton, mushroom and cheese and is huge enough to satisfy one person. However, when you come to Spize you typically don't come alone, and the Roti John is also great for sharing.Other things I'd order when I'm here are their prata, which come crispy and hot out of the pan, maggi goreng and nasi ayam kunyit. If you have a huge group then also order the murtabak which is a bit pricey but really filling.I would normally pair sirap limau or teh cino peng with everything I've recommended above, to wash down all the curry and sauces.",

A favourite of most people is Spize, which is known because of its large area and its several other outlets. The one in Bedok, though, is the best place for your Spize experience. The staff are all really friendly, you can chose from the front, indoors or the back (I recommend the back, that's where the party's really at) and you've got a pretty extensive menu to choose from. Even for vegan/vegetarians, you've got the usual Nasi or Mee Goreng options which can easily be customised to suit your non-animal diet, and then there are some pastas and medeterranian sides (like Hummus, $8) which you can add to the table. A personal favourite is Tofu Tiga Rasa, which literally means in malay, Three Flavour Tofu. It's not completely honest, however; you'll taste at least 8 flavours and then some. Add some Teh Ice Limau to your dinner and you're all set. And with mainly reasonable prices you'll be back again, if not for the food then for the vibe.",

In all my aircon loving, atas restaurant only glory? No way. Cue sideways glance. Ahem. Ok I confess. I'm an aircon loving kampong girl at heart. And Spize does a mean Thai style maggi goreng that I find spicy, sour, and super addictive. I don't even know why I like it that much; it's not that great, but I think fried carbs at midnight must be the ultimate comfort food. The gado gado too. Thick peanutty sauce, dense rice cake, spuds and bite sized pieces of keropok. It doesn't get anything better than this. I always see patrons drinking bandung or this blue colored drink that frankly scares me a little. If you've a sweet tooth, go for the Horlicks dinosaur. If you thought the Milo dinosaur was sweet, boy are you in for a real kick in the pants. It's thick and incredibly potent and by the time you're halfway through, you'll need a bottle of water to dilute all that sugar in your blood stream. You heard it here first!",

If you're feeling really hungry, go for the chicken biryani which comes in generous portions. My personal favorites at Spize are the cheese fries and the chicken wings. Nothing too fanciful, just the usual sin food at supper.I enjoy the outdoor seating as well. Just a laid back and relaxed atmosphere; you can chat and laugh loudly with your buddies without the worries of being judged. If you feel that you are too spoilt for choice, do ask the servers for their recommendations. They are more than glad to recommend some of the popular and good food around. Great hangout for your late night!",

I like this bigger branch better than the other branch in River Valley.On my last visit, I found that they have set up tentages over the alfresco dining area. It's long overdue. If it rained in the past, the wait staff had to carry plates of food and wet tables and chairs into the sheltered areas. The tentages make the dining experience more comfortable for staff and diners.",

I usually have roti prata when I'm there with a milo dinosaur and possibly sharing mee pattaya with someone, but there's a huge selection of food available given the time of the night. They range from local foods to western food, and many many more. The prices are cheap, like that of a coffee shop with each prata slightly more than a dollar and an average meal is unlikely to cost more than $10. They open till 3 am every night and open at 11 am. There is usually quite a lot of people at night sitting outdoors and the atmosphere is lively, a great place to hang out with friends after dark and not too far from home if you live in the east.",
