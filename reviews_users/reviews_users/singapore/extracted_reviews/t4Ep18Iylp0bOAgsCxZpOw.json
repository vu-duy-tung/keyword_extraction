    "text": "Being the meat lover that I am, everytime a new steak joint opens, you can be sure that I'll be there. I'm glad to say that Wooloomooloo is all good in my books. While the decor might scare the cheapskates off, thanks to its fine dining looks, prices are relatively reasonable. Furthermore, you get to enjoy a beautiful view of the surrounding area that adds to the romantic ambience of the restaurant, perfect for a date night. This being a steakhouse, my advice is to avoid everything else on the menu and just go for the steaks! The tomahawk is large enough for two so get some sides to go with it and you'll enjoy the perfect meal for two at an affordable price.",

    "text": "Dined here twice. First experience was great enough that I decided to visit again for my husband's birthday. Maybe my expectations were too high the 2nd time round? I was very disappointed with the service and food this time. We ordered the iceberg lettuce, crab cakes, ribeye steaks. The first dish was dismal, it looked liked a lettuce \u00a0was hastily chopped into half, a small amount of blue cheese sauce then drizzled on top and a sprinkling of bacon bits added. I could have done it myself, totally not worth the price on the menu. The crab cakes were much better though still not as good as the ones in Morton's in my opinion. We then waited at least another 45 min for the steaks to be served. The staff kept coming over to apologize, citing problems in the kitchen. However, I pointed out to them that patrons who came much later than us were already served. It was when I finally wanted to cancel the steaks that they came. They were done just right but by then my appetite had been ruined by the whole experience. At least the manager came out to apologize to us at the end and served us a complimentary chocolate lava cake, which is why I'm still giving them 3 stars. However with so many other great steakhouses available to choose from, its unlikely I'll return for a 3rd visit.",

It almost makes the 2 hour wait for our food worth it... almost..Service was a bit disappointing; they forgot our reservation (wasn't the only group, the couple after us also made reservations that couldn't be found). They sat us at the bar, and though the barman was a really nice guy, he forgot to take our order, and took really long to mix our drinks because... (coming to my next point)They were severely understaffed; it was like one waiter per section of 20+pax, and one server couldn't take orders because he wasn't allowed to? (Probably a trainee staff/ underage so he couldn't take drink orders too). I assume the kitchen was lacking humans too because nobody in our section was getting any food. However, I must emphasize that their staff remained professional (gave out bread while we waited), and were all really nice. I would advise that they have a back up plan especially if they are expecting a lot of people. Gave this a high rating purely based on food & people service. Would come back for the steak",

The caramelized onion focaccia is salty, crispy, and addictive. The taste of the mediterranean is a burrata dish with tomatoes and prosciutto. \u00a0The flavors married beautifully together and the dish was salty, rich, and of course flavorful. \u00a0The sirloin was a great cut of meat with good marbling and cooked to our specifications. \u00a0All steaks come with 4 sauces (mushroom, peppercorn, mustard, and au jus) which tasted of rich, beef broth. \u00a0The creamed spinach is a classic dish, but the truffled macaroni and cheese had wonderful, aromatic notes of truffle oil. \u00a0It was divine!I had a great dining experience here and would definitely return to get my steak and slider fix. \u00a0The only odd thing is that sliders are only served in the lounge as part of happy hour. \u00a0Nevertheless, I'll happily sit in the lounge and munch on them!",

And trust me, there are missteps.We went for dinner, and the molten chocolate cake we ordered, that's made to order, apparently collapsed/exploded in the oven. We were not interested in ANOTHER 20 minute way after the previous fifteen minute on. The lobster bisque had split, leaving it runny and curdled, instead of creamy and rich. Another of the sides we ordered, I forget what it was now, just tasted peculiar, with a sharp tartness instead of creaminess that we expected. That at least was taken off the bill once we highlighted it, but we didn't say anything about the bisque because it wasn't until later that I could figure out what i was so watery (and why there were curdles), and I'm not the sort to complain until I can figure out if something went wrong... or if a dish is generally bad.The steak though, the 1.6kg bone-in steak. Oh that steak. Was amazing. Tender, succulent, juicy tasty. And the beef carpaccio? Fatty and well marbled melt in your mouth raw beef. Quite simply, Wooloomooloo is a steakhouse, and they know their beef. Tread around the rest of the menu with care because it can be hit and miss... but damn. That beef.",

The scallops, not so much, as they were a tad rubbery.We shared a 20 ounce porterhouse medium rare, which was perfect. I don't think we could have finished a bigger steak. We ordered mashed potatoes and creamed spinach as sides to go along with it. The sides were pretty large, so do share if you do go there. I don't normally like creamed spinach, but their's was creamier than usual and pretty yum, if I say so myself.There is a pretty good sommelier in-house, so we picked a pretty good bottle of red, which went perfectly with our meal. He let us try a few reds before we found one that we liked.Dessert was apple crumble and choc lava cake. I didn't try the crumble but it looked so-so. The lava cake was one of the better ones I've had. It was also pretty huge and I couldn't finish it (and I usually manage to).All in all, a good dinner and experience.",

WOOLOOMOOLOO (haha. I just had to do that).nestled in the corner of raffles city, we were ushered to our seat where we can marvel the singapore skyline while we tuck into some good moo. lighting was a little too dim to read the menu in and i did notice some ingenious patrons using their mobile phone light to scan through the menu. it was funny...we tucked into crabcake and scallops that were a great start to the meal. it was perfectly done and really goooodd! the olive onion bread was also baked so perfectly and we even had to get seconds! It really set a high expectation for the main reason for the existence of wooloomooloo... THE MOO!My friends' meals were done perfectly to their taste but when mine came I was terribly disappointed - it was medium well and not medium rare that I asked for. but i was way too hungry and a little lazy to request for a change. disappointing as that maybe, it was seasoned well and if you enjoy a medium well steak, it would have been a happy moo but for me who prefer a little rarity i was a little boo-ed out.the staff were overall alright and the Aussie Ma\u00eetre d' did attempt to tell us about his new year party and his girlfriend (damn!) and try to engage us. I had informed them about my steak being overdone to see what their reaction will be. sadly, they were just stumped as though this was the first time such a thing happened. i was a little disappointed they didnt offer anything or even attempt to salvage the situation.so we paid and left. my friends were happy campers but I left with a little hesitation to return...overall wooloomooloo is a good place for good moo and its starters are really impressive. a good place to consider if you wanna create a romantic date night with ur someone special. ask for the window seat!happy nooooo year!!!",

This was part of a set lunch, which also included a shimeji mushroom salad that was way too salty, and a mint panna cotta with an overly gelatinous consistency. Ate one spoonful and couldn't go on.What's saving this from one star is the complimentary focaccia bread, funnily enough. This came warm, in a large round bun and had caramelized onions on top. By large I mean a diameter of maybe 9cm, or hereabouts. The inside was dense but fluffy at the same time, and satisfying. Service isn't great -- they mixed up our coffee orders. Also inconsistent in whether the focaccia came pre-sliced or not. One half of the table had to stick a fork in and saw off bread slices themselves.",
