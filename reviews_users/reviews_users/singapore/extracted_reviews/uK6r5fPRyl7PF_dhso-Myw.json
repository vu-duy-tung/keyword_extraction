    "text": "When I asked my Singaporean friends what Singapore breakfast items I should definitely not miss, roti prata twice came up. Roti was originally an Indian dish, as \"roti\" means \"bread\" and \"prata\" means \"flat\", but regardless of its origins it's really become a staple food in Singapore.So I had to get some. Actually, this was the third spot I went to. I tried to go to two other ones before this and one of them was closed for three days, and in the other one they screamed at me and told to leave. lol. But this place looked really friendly. It seems to be a popular prata place, and it has all kinds of prata - a ton of combinations. I got one plain, one with cheese, and one with garlic. The garlic one tasted really... garlicly! It was beautiful, looked like a house. The regular one had a crispy and flaky outer shell, and was chewy on the inside. I'd literally been running all around Singapore for this. This bread went well with fish curry (no big pieces of fish there though) and lamb curry. Soak the pieces and eat! Tasty!The egg and cheese prata was incredibly wonderful! Less crispy but still awesome.I bought a barley drink there also and it was good.",

    "text": "When it comes to prata, Casuarina Curry is one of my hangout place for supper. Not the best but one of the more consistent ones I have had. \u00a0Traditionally Roti Prata is eaten with curry, sugar, condensed milk or plain. On some days I would just order egg prata with chicken curry, on some other days I would order plain, cheese, banana, chocolate, onion or even paper prata. Once you ordered, prata is served right away. Do make sure the prata they served you is hot as sometimes they precooked a whole bunch when it gets crowded. Service is fast, you get what you want when you ask for it. Tips: - Ask for piping hot prata as they do cook a bunch of prata ready to serve whenever someone orders.[010/100]",

    "text": "Went there last night. So far, this serves the best crispy prata as well as curry ever. I always order Onion Prata with Teh Halia \u00a0( ginger tea ) - not sweet. If you do not like your drinks too sweet, you have to let them know cos they are very generous with sweetened milk My prata came exceptionally quick - like within 5 min. It was really crispy. Drizzle a little chicken curry sauce ( or more if you desire ) and it is ready to be eaten. They serve chicken or fish curry sauce for the prata. Chicken curry sauce is thick n smooth. While is fish curry sauce is more watery and it is spicier, in my opinion.Oh, not forgetting their Bee Hoon Goreng is worth mentioning. The chef made it kind of tze-char like and it is very tasty. Order it without chilli if you cannot take too spicy. Either version is good. I had non spicy last night.Too bad it closes around 11.30pm nowadays. So no midnight prata supper anymore.",

    "text": "First lunch of the new year with my family at Casuarina Curry! We originally wanted to eat at crispy prata on Upper Thompson but parking was a b**** so we settled for Casuarina, which also required about a 10 minute wait and hawkish parking skillz before we finally got a lot.This old dame serves up large, soft with a slight crisp prata. If you want crispy, The Prata House is where you need to be. We're not too fussy so Casuarina was fine. We ordered all manner of prata - kosong, egg, onion, cheese and banana. I liked the egg and banana prata the best (latter was stolen off my brother's plate). We got chicken and mutton curry as well and while they weren't exactly chilli spicy, it was evenly spiced with the likes of cumin etc. Drinks are your standard kopitiam teas, coffees and lime juice. By the way, if you get the pot belly uncle taking your order. Do take a moment to marvel at his amazing memory. He took our complicated prata order for 4 people, curries and drinks (teh halia kosong, teh c siu dai, lime juice...) WITHOUT a notepad!",

    "text": "It's located just across my house, so whenever I feel hungry, I'll just walk across for a quick meal. One thing I love about Casuarina Curry is that the whole place is air conditioned! Why is this a big plus for me? Because I perspire easily! To top it off, I will be having curry with my prata so perspiring is definitely expected! Whenever I go there, I usually order their mushroom cheese and egg prata which is $3.50. It's quite big in serving and filled quite nicely with the ingredients and I just love the crispiness of the prata. I tried their murtabak once and regretted it because it was HUGE. So I will recommend sharing the murtabak with your friends unless you are a big eater. Do try their lassi as well! It's delicious! I am very partial to their strawberry lassi. It's a great and affordable place for dinner and a late night snack with your significant other or a big group of friends!",

    "text": "First of all, for a typical Indian prata place, this place has got one of the better service around. Especially when you compare it to the prata shops at Jalan Kayu, this shop's service come out tops.Food wise, it was disappointing though. We used to specifically made detours just to visit this shop for pratas but over the years, declining standards have made us visit this place less often.The last 2 occasions we were there, I was disappointed to find that the pratas were pre-cooked. They came to us less than 2 minutes after we placed our orders and were stone cold. The chocolate prata fared slightly better, it was cooked to order but it was over-cooked. Instead of the usual crisp texture, it is now chewy.The last visit was simply too much for us when everything we ordered came cold and the pratas were too chewy. With that, this place got relegated to just for coffee.",
