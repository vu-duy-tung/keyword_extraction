Nicely seared on the outside. Pork fillings is not porky so that's good. We (a party of 4) had a range of KAZAN Ramen and I personally had the curry ramen which I thought was good especially if you like curry. My friends has the seafood one which I really like the soup base because the soup base is light and flavourful. My other friend had this miso base one which she complained it's like homemade instant noodle. Haha... I tried her soup which I thought was honestly not bad. I enjoyed how they 'cook' my ramen! They serve my ramen in a hot stone bowl and they pour the soup base in it and it will sizzle and boil. They then cover the stone bowl with this funnel thingie to cook it more. I would have come back for more.",

The soup was salty but I didn't drink much of it. I prefer wavy noodles to the straight noodles that come with this dish so I'll try to ask them for that the next time. The egg was cooked well too. Kind of pricey.",

    "text": "They have a really interesting concept of volcano ramen, but the presentation is the only good thing about the ramen. The ramen was no longer ramen after a few bites, but a vegetable soup. No wonder they give unlimited rice. I didn't want to eat it anymore. I enjoy the texture of noodles, but every bite contained excessive amounts of vegetables.What I despised the most about this place was the mango ice. Again, the only good thing about it was the presentation. It was only some crushed ice, not even fluffy ice, mango syrup, 4 pieces of mango, and vanilla ice cream. I can easily make that at home. Why is this even on the menu? I gave it two stars because you will definitely get full from the unlimited rice.",

    "text": "We decided to give this ramen joint a try since it looked pretty decent and crowded. The restaurant is pretty small and can sit only a few tables. Despite the bad service reviews by other yelpers, the service here was pretty ok today.The volcanic ramen here seems to be the specialty, but since fellow Yelpers warned about the thick noodles for the volcanic ramen, we opted for the ramen instead. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with spicy miso and additional bamboo shoots. It was just okay. Definitely not the best I've had. I'd probably pay only $5 to eat this in a food court, not $15 in a restaurant :(The volcanic ramen which my friend ordered was pretty tasty. However, the portion was way too huge and probably large enough for two girls to share. The broth tasted strongly of vegetables, and hardly of miso :(Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of the ramen here and would not be returning again!",

    "text": "To be honest, I can't tell the difference between good ramen and bad ramen, so for the ramen enthusiasts out there, you can just keep scrolling. :)For those who are sticking around for this review, Hi! So, my husband and I come here every now and then and we've always been satisfied. We always order the typical shoyu ramen, gyoza, and the char siew rice bowl (not exactly Japanese, but... Whatevs it's still good.)During peak hours this place is pretty busy, but every time we've queued, the wait hasn't been too long. Once you get your orders in, it's not long before get your ramen. The other sides might take a little while longer, but it's not bad at all.The one quirky thing about this place is that they have a small poster of the manager (I think he might be the head chef as well) that basically summarizes his life story, confirms he is legit Japanese, and shares other intimate details (for example, his blood type. Can't make this stuff up.) I wanted to take a picture of said poster but I didn't want to look weird/rude, so for now you'll have to take my word for it!Overall, it's a nice, cosy restaurant to get your ramen fix if you frequent Square 2 and if you're super curious about who's managing your food. :)",

    "text": "Having passed by Tonkotsu Kazan Ramen a lot of times, I finally have the chance to visit this place for dinner. Originated from Osaka, Japan, this place is famous for their kazan (volcanic) ramens, where their famed tonkotsu broth is poured onto the ramen on a stone bowl and cooked until the steam comes out (which according to them is volcanic eruption!). They have also opened their second outlet at Liang Court 3 months ago! The Kazan Curry is one of the variants of kazan ramen with the specially blended curry paste being added to the tonkotsu broth. The portion is rather huge so it can be shared by 2 people (or even 1 if you have a huge appetite). The curry is fragrant and rich in flavour. The noodles are rather chewy and springy (althoughly slightly soggy as well). Probably the only downside is the portion of the noodle is rather little, as compared to a whole lot of vegetables inside (especially beansprouts). The Yaki Gyoza is rather soft (as opposed to most places having it crispy) and full of fillings, but taste rather normal and missable. Although this is a small restaurant, this place is a great place to have ramen if you are within the Novena area.",

    "text": "Their specialty is the kazan (volcanic) ramen. The style is somewhat like 'jiro ramen'. The noodles, beansprouts, giant leek, cabbage, cha siu are all placed in a heated stone bowl (not unlike bibimbap) and served without soup. At the table, the server will pour in half the soup, let it cook for a minute, before pouring the rest in. The bowl is covered with an inverted funnel-like thing. When steam comes out, it looks supposedly like a volcano, thus the name. It comes with a bowl of don (rice) which you are supposed to add in after you finish the noodles. There are 4 styles to choose from: shio, shoyu, miso and curry*. ($18) They also serve the normal ramen with your usual add ons (Cha Siu, Egg etc.). Here, you get the thin straight kind of noodles instead. If I am not wrong, the style resembles hakata ramen, without the bamboo shoots. ($12 ++)Verdict:I tried the miso tonkotsu kazan ramen. I wasn't expecting the thick lor mee noodle, would have preferred the thin ones. The soup was good, not quite as fatty as some of the ones you get outside; it is very rich, but without the floating pieces of solid fat chunk that does not actually add much to the taste. There is ALOT of vegetables, not unlike what you get from bario at ramen challenge, bugis. You could even say it borders on healthy :p The cha siu was soft, tender, flavorful, but they only added 3-4 pieces. With the noodle and the don, this is definitely a huge meal; definitely not for the faint-hearted. While I have not tried it, I would recommend the shoyu ramen with extra cha siu. This guarantees that you get all the ramen goodness in one bowl.* Curry ramen?!?!?To learn more about the jiro style, ramenchampion.com.sg/abo\u2026 \u00a0 \u00a0(See Bario)ieatishootipost.sg/2010/\u2026",
