    "text": "A relatively humble restaurant in the glossy surroundings of paragon mall, I was more interested in the food quality for my visiting mother who had a craving for Indonesian food...Only able to make reservations up to 730pm, we arrived at 745pm and faced a 30 minute wait... However being able to order before being seated did speed up the process so we weren't grumbling.Great dishes? The rendeng, bergadele and the tahu telor (although I think you need 4 people to do it justice). The Sayur lodeh was pretty 'meh' and I envied the fried chicken on other people's tables... Satay and tempeh were decent but not outstanding.Service was prompt and not unpleasant. The pricing wasn't disagreeable either - well unless you order 8 dishes between 3 people and then you get a bit of a surprise!",

    "text": "Tried their signature dish Tahu Telor, honestly it was a bit oily. It's pretty much cubed tofu wrapped in this deep fried egg - garnished with shredded cucumber and dark sauce that's supposed to be spicy but I didn't taste the spice in it, more sweet if anything. Gado Gado was reasonable. I ordered Soto Ayam soup for my son but he wasn't much of a fan. Tasted decent. Singkong Santan was exactly what it was supposed to be - drenched in coconut cream. I couldn't eat a lot cause it's so rich. Kailan didn't look like gailan but was decent. Rendang Lembu was decent. Not the best I've had but tasted authentically Indonesian. Ayam Goreng Istimewa was okay - better to ask for some additional sambal, makes everything nicer with sambal. Overall, decent taste but I've had better. Location is conveniently located B1 paragon mall. Can't prebook on the weekends but we got a table pretty quick.",

    "text": "We've been coming here for years for our indo food fix. Despite being in the middle of Orchard in Paragon (so atas!) the food prices here are pretty reasonable, though the food portions have been shrinking!The tauhu telor here is THE BEST. My favorite tauhu telor in the world. I can eat one on my own, if I come here alone.The sambal squid and beef rendang are also solid and are staples for us. Cendol here is also very good. They don't fool around with gula melaka!The curry chicken, lontong, shrimp with smelly peas (serious! that's what those peas are called!) are not bad too.My only dislike is the 'otah'. It's not really otah, but is some sort of fish thing wrapped in banana leaves like otah. It has a very weird texture.Needless to say, we will be back. Just for the tahu telor!!",

    "text": "If you love chili, you will want to get their sambal. It is super spicy that it kinda burns my tongue. I love the curry puff, unfortunately it is not available at this outlet. The curry puff is sold only in the morning on certain days and sells out quickly at the Tanglin outlet. I ordered the chicken fried rice and soto ayam soup. Both dishes were very average, quite a disappointment actually. I also had the chendol which was marginally better. Somehow I think I prefer the version over at the Tanglin outlet. The service could be better as it took a while to get a server's attention, even though there were not that many diners at that time. The dishes on other tables looked more appetizing, so maybe I did not order the correct items. But it is great that they do serve 1-dish meal so it does make it a good spot for a quick lunch when you are on your own.",

    "text": "This was just a-ok. As a heads up, the chips they offer you at the beginning after you are seated are chargeable, so do be upfront with the server if you don't want them. And to echo another reviewer, they will charge for the wet towels even if you don't use them, so you'll have to have the server remove it manually before paying the check.Out of all the items we ordered, I liked the tahu telor the best. I've never tried this dish before, and I loved it! It's fried bean curd that is drizzled with a spicy/sweet sauce, and the presentation is really cool; it's cylindrical and looks like a nest.The beef rendang had good flavours, but I thought the meat could be a lot more tender. The ayam goreng istimewa was a total miss, as it was dry and overcooked. I was hoping for more juicy, golden brown, deep fried chicken wing goodness but sadly, no dice.Considering it's location in the basement of Paragon, prices are a bit higher but still affordable compared to other places in the area. But given the mains aren't that great and the trouble you have to go through for the extra charges, this wouldn't be my first choice in Paragon.",

This restaurant is in the basement of Paragon mall and definitely worth the trip!Service is a tad bit too slow but maybe that is a thing here in Singapore.Food, on the other had, was excellent.Had the Ox Tail soup for appetizer which was very good - meat was well cooked and the soup was full of flavor.For the main course we had the following -Chicken Kari Ayam - chicken in coconut milk sauce - it was good and seemed Thai to me.Rendang Lembu - Beef in reduced coconut sauce - definitely the winner of the meal - the beef was succulent and slow-cooked to perfection and the sauce by itself was to die for!We also tried the lemongrass drink Air Serai which was good too.A definite stop when in the mood for good Indonesian food!",
