The food varieties is great and quality of food matches the price you paid during lunch.Do expect crowds of people taking food. For sashimi you have to go to the counter and request as they do not place the sashimi out. Dessert is amazing as there are lots o choices! Would recommend this!",

    "text": "Dear belly, I am sorry for the abuse you had gone through last night after our meal at Kiseki.... I am sorry for the lousy salmon sashimi that didn't even have the skin layer cleaned off... I know we could have gotten a much better experience by going to Cold Storage, but I though it was Friday and I wanted to give you a treat. After all, we flew more than 20 hours to get here once a year. And of course I know you weren't going to forgive me for the yucky prawns which were tasteless at best and the atrocious scallops which were supposed to be fresh... I know I know you are weeping because I cheated you with the fabulous pictures posted outside Kiseki but the real deal looked nothing like it... or more like a shit storm just torn through the restaurant right before we got there! Importantly, I beg your pardon for the worst cooked buffet selection you had to endure. I am very sorry that I even offered you the undercooked corn, taste buds insulting yaki selection and much more. On a brighter note, I am glad you didn't have to talk to Mr anus right away about the watery diarrhea he had to process like the rest of the family after the meal... actually I am just sorry to even remind you of the horror and traumatic experience last night. I would like to reassure you that this wasn't intentional and yes yes there's so much more in Singapore to try please just don't give up on me just yet.... please. Regards,Bi",

    "text": "Got my expectation too high when coming to this restaurant. Food variety is bad. Food quality is bad. Replenishment is an issue. Unagi cheese fried rice is only good on its sound. The real thing is just a regular fried rice, nothing to be desired, but it not the worst part yet. The soba is floury, the soba sauce is lukewarm instead of cold. The taste is bland. The ebi tempura is not a tempura at all. It is a Chinese food deep fried shrimp. I guess the restaurant doesn't think they are different. \u00a0Black curry sauce... You'd better avoid. Cawan mushi is alright and they get it right for most part but it will be forever before they replenish it. Sake karagee is good and one of the few good things in this restaurant. Don't make me start on salmon sashimi since I am not sure what kind of salmon or which part of it being used but it is very chewy and doesn't take like usual salmon. Other buffet places are much better than this and even sushi express. Oh and it is the only fish sashimi they have. Awesome. Shrimp and crab legs are OK I guess? The only ones being replenished quite quickly so it is better if they change the concept to Chinese buffet? Dessert variety is abysmal, quality is questionable since it is my first time eating a puke-textured mochi that I fought my gag reflect to the fullest not to spit it. So if you want a Japanese buffet then it is better for you to eat at the one in suntec city since it is Japanese and it is good both in quality and variety. Avoid this place whenever possible how good their ice Coke is.",

    "text": "When you factor in the fact that weekday lunch at Kiseki is just under $20++, it's actually pretty decent fare for what you paid. Word to the wise though, make reservations ahead of time or you'll end up in the walk-in line which can take a while if they can only seat you when there are no-shows. Nice selection of sashimi that is decently fresh. They also had a yu-shang station next to it when I was there after CNY. Decent selection of cooked foods from shrimp tempura to Japanese chicken congee to fried salmon heads and more. Seemed like the only MTO dish that they deliver to your table was the seafood hotpot which was forgettable. Drinks and dessert also included in the buffet. Considering that set-lunches can already set you back over $20, it's a pretty good deal for lunch at Kiseki especially if you like variety.",

I also like the sweet potato and ebi tempura. A large variety of hot and cold drinks are available. They also have interesting gelato flavours like wasabi (gasp!) and Yuzu, along with green tea and vanilla. Great gelato texture and good flavours.

    "text": "This is hands down one of the best buffet places I have ever visited. It offers a wide selection of main dishes and delectable desserts. Most of the main dishes are prepared on the spot, ensuring that each dish is piping hot for your consumption.At stations like the teppanyaki grill, one can select from fish, chicken or pork. Each of these choices were cooked to perfection with juices dripping off the chunks. Another one of my favourites was the mini rosti - essentially strips of potatoes pan fried in butter. Slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, every bite was pure heaven.Other main stations include sushi, chawanmushi (steamed egg), hot pot and yakitori.Now moving on to the desserts. Like most buffet places, it offers a selection of dainty cakes and even a chocolate fountain with a selection of fruits. But what stood out amongst these already awesome choices was its tofu cheesecake. Imagine this; silky cheesecake of the creamiest and richest texture, and you know for a fact that it is a healthier choice with the tofu compared to your average cheesecake. Need I say more.The store's pomelo sorbet was also a refreshing dessert with its sweet and tart flavours perfect for clearing your palate.Its new location at Orchard Central is also an added bonus for accessibility. With good food, an affordable price and prime location, there's really nothing stopping you from visiting the restaurant. You can be sure that I'll be returning for more soon!",

Food choice is vast, but you get tired of the taste after you overfeed yourself the first two plates with everything on it. It'll feel like youre gulping a blender concoction of food. Yuck! The trick is to eat just like you do in an a la carte restaurant, one plate one kind of food at a time. Eating all kinds at once will cause your taste buds send multiple sensory signals to the brain and cause it to get nauseated. Like reading magazine while travelling in a car in a city traffic. You'll want to throw up.",

    "text": "Looking for a place that gathers a bunch of good people? I needed a smorgasbord of International foods that could make my \u00a0group happy and this 280-seat buffet joint - Kiseki Japanese Buffet looks extremely ultimate with a roomy and well-ventilated environment. It becomes one of my shortlisted.I am not a typical fan of buffet-style meal but I am happy to have it once in a while. And specially when the group is large, I can rest assured that each of them will find something fanciful among the 8 self-help stations. This is achievable, given the mega spread Kiseki is offering. Not sure if its a blessing, but close to 40% of the range are non-Japanese cuisines. While the Japanese dishes still make up the majority, I am one of those weirdo who only eye for that fluffy looking deep pocketed batter cake resting on the iron rack. For all you know, I am dotty about waffles.In my view, a buffet feast equates a marathon. Just as the gun sounded, I find myself derailed and taking shortcuts to the finishing line - dessert station. There, my eyes are fixed at the lady behind the waffle maker, counting the number of waffle wedges she is dishing out and eye balling frantically for condiments for a switch up. Fresh fruit dices -nope. Candy rice - nope nope. Jellied puddings, mochi and Daifuku - nope nope nope. Until I reached the chilling box with 6-8 flavours of gelato - yes; black sesame, green tea & vanilla checked (even though they all turned melty in the chiller?!?). Then that chocolate fondue drizzles - again marked! They are invited to join me at my table. Results of them all? The gelato was nice and creamy but the exterior wasn't \u00a0crisp enough, least comparable to Gel\u00e1re. Sadly, the whole grid cake was soft in nature. Still, I remain faithful to my beloved dough-based cake.After the off-track, I joined the rest on the official route - pacing up and down the counters, examined each food items closely. I picked a few sizable tempura from the Agemono sub-section - ebi, kani stick & yasai (broccoli), all tasted fresh and crunchy of which, I liked the vegetable most. Okay, crowned me a fake-vegan title if you like.Then slightly to the right, there are Teppanyaki & Robatayaki where you find monstrous grilled salmon fish heads, shishamo, baby tender chicken teriyaki sticks and grilled plumply shitake mushrooms. Towards the end of the row, I ordered some wok fry assorted vegetables, mostly bean sprouts with a few stringy choy sum - not bad though I'd prefer marche's. My girlfriend ordered a portion of Teppanyaki pork collar in ginger sauce which I thought was pretty delicious, moist and very tender, not fibrous and the seasoning was just right. The cook done it better than the garlic beef steak which tasted leathery. Oh, please bring along those table-numbered mini file clips found on your table when ordering so that the wait staff could send the food when it's ready.Walk around the bustling see-through kitchen, another row of food items revealed. At the left-hand corner, you could order Italian pasta of 3 choices - Wafu vinaigrette dressing, creamy carbonara or konkase tomato sauce; alternatively, pick up a ready thin-crust pizza with teriyaki chicken, Japanese curry or seafood toppings. Potato-goers could give the R\u00f6sti a shot, its shredded surface was pan-roasted to crisp but it lacked that robust buttery flavour I used to know.Stroll along and you get to reach out to more fried items like potato ebi rolls, cheese crab balls, seafood Croquettes, Haru Maki (spring roll) seafood. Next, I flipped open the steamer cover and help myself to the hearty winter dish - Japanese Oden with plentiful of squishy quail eggs, fish cakes with hidden popping fish roe, perfectly stewed daikon, glutenous Konjac (greyish starch corms) and the most delightful Kinchaku pouch - deep fried bean curd wrapped with fish cake. I enjoyed the light soy sauce broth that makes everything taste homely.While I skipped the egg plants and roasted chicken, I took a bite on the Japanese curry udon placed along the next counter. I am glad that the udon didn't taste overly soggy but the curry seasoning was a bit loud, somewhere didn't fare quite right. I heard the pork shabu ramen did better. Well, I was unlucky then.You may want to try out Chawanmushi or Tamagoyaki in the bamboo tray plus a bowl of steaming hot seafood soup. Or simply walk to the adjacent counter for some cold seafood selections - chilled prawns & mussels or clams, salads, soba, sushi and sashimi.With so much to offer, what else could make my people \u00fcber happy? I don't know.",

Another 5, 6 different of kinds of ice-cream, macha (green tea) is not even up to the bar...and it was squeezed in a corner when there's always a line and right beside someone having their meals.It was rather noisy on the Vesak Day...I will continue to try out other Japanese restaurant.",
