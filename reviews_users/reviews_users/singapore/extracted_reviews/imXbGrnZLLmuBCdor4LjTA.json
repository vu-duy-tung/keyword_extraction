    "text": "Beautifully decorated, Jim Thompson is one of the better Thai restaurants in Singapore, in my opinion. It is in Dempsey Hill, but you really feel like you are at a Thai resort - the decor is pretty impeccable. As for the food, it erred on the spicy side but was overall very good. I had a number of Thai favorites - pad Thai, etc - and all were pretty tasty. We sat outside in the patio area and were entertained by Thai dancing, as well, for some of the time. Only slight complaint is the music was a bit too loud (traditional Thai music), while we were sitting outside.",

The waitress was very pleasant and responsive. \u00a0The food was decent but given the high prices, I was expecting great not just good. Not to say they didn't have options. They had plenty of choices from curry to rice to noodles. I did notice that everything on the starters menu was deep fried, although it all tasted good. I do recommend this place if you want to make an impression, ie first date. The food might be good here but the ambiance is great.",

The moment you walk towards the entrance of the restaurant, you are greeted by women in traditional Thai costumes. It's a great feeling of being in Thailand. The ambience of the restaurant is just fantastic. They have a vegetarian menu for folks like me - that's just fabulous. \u00a0We ordered coconut water to quench our thirst, what a way to get refreshed quickly! \u00a0It's served in the coconut and they even give you a spoon to scoop out the soft coconut flesh to eat once you are done drinking the water. We had the green curry, cashew tofu, fried rice and regular rice. Everything was delicious. We didn't have room for dessert. The service was out of the world. \u00a0Even though the restaurant was a tad bit expensive, it's totally worth it. \u00a0Great place to chill and unwind with great food. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I had a tough time choosing between 3 and 4 stars for the Jim Thompson Thai restaurant on Dempsey Hill. They'd officially get 3.5 for me. I called in advance to make a reservation for 6 the day before and my husband requested outside seating.We got there and the architecture of the building reminded me a lot of the Jim Thompson museum in Bangkok. We were seated outside and got to watch 3 women dressed in Thai garb dance the whole evening. It was a little warm out and the patio did not have fans, so if you overheat easily (especially when noshing on spicy Thai food), I recommend grabbing a table inside.The drinks were good, but a little pricey at approximately $24 each. The mojitos were wonderful and so was the Jim Thompson Cooler. My husband and I started out with the Chef's Special Appetizer ($32) and it came with chicken satay, tiger prawns, crab spring rolls, marinated grilled beef rolls, and minced chicken salad. Sauces were brought out for all and they were delicious. We were actually able to order brown rice here in order to try to stick to our Paleo lifestyle. The rice was very earthy, a bit crunchy and delicious with the green curry and beef. We also got the half rotisserie Thai chicken ($26), which was cooked perfectly. In addition to this, we got the morning glory vegetable ($14) for the table. The food was excellent, and the service was friendly. They did get a little swamped shortly after we got there and we did have to ask for our second round of drinks a few times. The ambiance was lovely, and the food was good. If you're looking for a nice restaurant for a special occasion, this is a great choice.",

What I like about Thai is that you don't need to spend much to experience great food, but hey, there's nothing wrong with splurging every now and then (or so I keep telling myself!)Jim Thompson sets the tone immediately when you arrive. As it's outside Dempsey Hill, it's a bit more secluded, which gives off this feeling of being personally invited to someone's beautiful black and white home. At the entrance, there are ladies dressed in traditional Thai clothing that greet you in Thai, complete with the slight bow and palms pressed together. Walking inside, the decor was quite opulent. Nice silk decorations (after all... this is Jim Thompson we're talking about), occasional live music, and a beautiful bar.I dined here with my husband and his auntie, and we chose 2 curries, Pad Thai, and a veggie side dish. We all thought everything was well done. I thoroughly enjoyed my beef Mussaman curry (as it wasn't spicy) and the red curry with grapes blew me away. I thought the grapes would be weird (what can I say, sometimes my tastes are like that of a 5 year old) but it added sweetness that complemented the savoury curry very well. And the Pad Thai? Absolutely wonderful, it's one of the best Pad Thai's we've had outside Thailand! The crowd on a weekday night was majority expats, and it seemed like a lot of business meetings were going down. It's definitely a place to file under \"Special Occasion\", \"Important Business Meeting\", or \"I'm Feeling Generous, Let Me Invite My Favourite CM Michelle To Jim Thompson Just Because\".",

You will find great variety on the menu, serving you more than 80 classic Thai dishes, including appetizers, spicy salads, soups, curries, main dishes, seafood, barbeque, noodles, desserts and more.The prices are high (you will spend around 30- 120 dollars), but the ambiance makes up for it.The building is beautifully historic, definitely a must try, at least once!",

The tasty plummy chilli dip did little to save the overdone appetizer.2) Khao Phad Nam Lieb ($20) - rice fried with black olives and minced chicken, sided by raw shallots, lime dice, cashews, and chillis: one of two dishes that actually passed muster, this had a good amount of flavour and char.3) Gaeng Panang Neau ($24) - panang curry with Australian beef tenderloin, coconut cream, and crushed peanuts: the other commendable dish, but it would have been better served piping hot, instead of tepid.4) Phad Grapow Gai ($22) - stir-fried minced chicken with straw mushrooms, garlic, birds eye chilli, and holy basil: should have been punchy but it was disappointingly vapid.5) Pla Ga Pong Daeng Thod Gra Tiem ($22) - deep-fried red snapper fillets blanketed in an gooey garlic sauce: let down by the less than sparkling fresh fish. The muddy taste of the fish overwhelmed the lovely sauce",

    "text": "I will admit I went in with very low expectations as I had just come back from a week in Thailand and was used to very spicy authentic Thai food. I thought this would be bland and expat-oriented. Let me tell you that I was actually quite pleasantly surprised. I quite liked it! Lots of choice (oddly including some western fare) but for example the papaya salad had the proper level of heat. I enjoyed the chicken curry and various starters and the sides of vegetables and the coconut rice for dessert. Check out my blog post, I was there with friends for their birthdays. 88$++ for brunch for 3h on the weekend, including freeflow prosecco, I think it was 58$ for the food with soft drinksmylifeinsin.com/2013/10/\u2026",

    "text": "If you ever need a place to take a client or a business partner to a beautiful looking restaurant that won't break the bank, Jim Thompson is your place! Nestled in the jungle of Dempsey Hill, this restaurant almost seems like an an oasis among the scores of beautiful trees that line the restaurant. I went for dinner with my wife and my aunt visiting from Hong Kong. We were greeted by thai dancers strutting their stuff to traditional thai music, not to mention, the all too familiar words of \"Sawadee ka.\" The decor within the restaurant is sublime. It's probably best to see the pictures to see what I mean. This restaurant oozes with \"expat\" appeal and is evident by the restaurant's patrons. \u00a0I, for one, like to go to Thai restaurants where there are a lot of Thais in order to personally certify the restaurant food's authenticity. Although Thai patrons were few and far between, the food, nonetheless, was very good and authentic. \u00a0 Our order included Pad Thai, Beef Mussaman Curry and a veggie Thai Dish. The Pad Thai was the best I've had in Singapore. It's probably because Pad Thai is the THE expat dish of Thailand and this dish has to be a hit in order for this restaurant to bring its target demographic. As for the Mussaman Curry, I second my wife when she says it wasn't too spicy. My only compliant about the restaurant, believe it or not, is the ridiculously small portion white rice they give. :D Overall, the restaurant is just beautiful and the food is a sure fire winner. Personally, I would not pay these lofty prices for Thai Food, as there are so many great Thai options in Singapore and with Thailand a short place ride away, but the ambiance, experience and the backdrop of Dempsey Hill is all built into the price!",
