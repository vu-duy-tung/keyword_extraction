    "text": "I love having breakfast as an option anytime of the day so Wild Honey wins me over just based on that alone.I think since they opened another outlet at Scotts Square not too far away, the crowd here has lessened, came here on a friday evening just before dinner and didn't have to queue.For such pricey food, I'd expect to at least have a waiter take my order while I'm seated instead of going to the counter myself to order.You get ushered to your seat and then you have to order at the counter where there's a picture menu on a ipad you can scroll through to make your decision. Was feeling like ordering healthy with my partner so we chose salmon dishes - he had the scandinavian (grilled salmon on potato rosti) and I had the norwegian (poached eggs with salmon and asparagus). The norwegian was a very hearty dinner, 2 servings on the poached egg and salmon on top of generous thick brioche and a nice detail of salmon roe on top.The scandinavian was slightly bland, but there's salt rock and pepper on your table for you to season it yourself to your liking, it just needed that little bit of pepper.Final verdict: I'd only come here when I crave for exotic breakfasts during dinner, other than that, not really worth the high price.",

Its other outlet is newly opened at Scotts Square!The Norwegian is highly recommended with its generous portions and solid ingredients. The fresh sweet smoked salmon is paired with ikura, grilled asparagus and two poached eggs, and drenched with well-made hollandaise sauce and served on two thick whole-wheat challah brioche.The Tunisian ($18) which is distinctively Middle Eastern is a must-try here. It consists of Shashouka, and its basic ingredients consist of a thick spicy tomato stew cooked in a skillet. A few eggs are then poached in the tomato stew and it's served piping hot with some salad and fresh bread.",

    "text": "Great breakfast / brunch food! So many amazing options it's a real struggle to decide. The English Breakfast was the popular choice at my brunch on Sunday, and everyone was satisfied (and stuffed) after eating it. The toast was thick and fluffy, scrambled eggs perfectly done (not too runny, not at all dry).I chose the Californian which had a healthy-but-still-yummy feel. The tofu gave the scramble a nice creamy texture (if you like tofu, that is!). Also tried the Sweet Morning which was delicious and not too sweet. French toast slices were nice and thick.The table got some donuts to share which had raspberry filling. Good fluffy donuts, not overwhelmed by the filling. We were all just too full from our mains to finish them...Only downside was the timing of the service... meals arrived spread out over the course of 20 (or more?) minutes. One friend received her french toast at least 10 minutes before anyone else got their food, and my dish arrived 10 minutes after everyone else had already been served. Made for a very disjointed meal. But, have to say the food was good enough to make me want to come back. Maybe I'll just try a different location next time, and hope we fair better!",

    "text": "So I've been on a search for a good plate of Eggs Benedict in Singapore. I like my perfectly poached egg with the whites soft and pillowy, the yolk nice and runny. You'd be surprised the number of times I've ordered poached eggs in Singapore with high hopes, only to discover my egg whites rubbery and the yolks are mushy. The hollandaise sauce has to be creamy but not stick to your stomach cream. Its gotta have a little runny-ness to it. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon at Wild Honey and requested a perfectly poached egg of soft pillowy whites and runny yolk. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they did it right. I enjoyed the dish and had a pleasant experience here while I typed away working on my computer (had a deadline). The iced tea I ordered was also delicious. Not too big a fan of the prices but whatevs, its Orchard road area, service was decent, and ambience was eclectic homey.",

    "text": "Comparing Wild Honey to Clinton Street Baking Company back home, I'll say this: The waits at CB are longer and the food is better.However, I happen to be one of those people who have no trouble rising a bit early (these days, in fact, it's mandatory) and I always manage to snag a table with a 15-20 minute wait. I'll let you in on a secret; if you get there by 10:30 the wait times tend to be shorter than they state. If you end up here later, wait times are long but you don't have to line up or wait in the sun.. just take a stroll through the mall until you get a call from the guys at the restaurant.I will say that the Wild Honey at Scotts Road is bigger and has more character than this one, but traffic has a way of adjusting itself. My wait times have been consistent between the 2 locations, and the food tastes nearly identical.I like that the menu items are organized by the country/region they are inspired from, and then Wild Honey does a fun little take on it. The food is closer to a tradional breakfast than a whimsy one, but they manage to keep it exciting. One of my favourite things to get here is the Tunisian (made veggie) - spicy shakshouka served with bread and salad. The eggs are nicely done, with runny yolks, the taste is spot on, even though the accompanying bread and salad are a bit of a disappointment. If your tastebuds are craving a good old kick in the nuts, try the spicy mex burrito. The portobello road, which is a modified eggs florentine, has decent flavours as well but is a bit more monotonous. Among the sweeter offerings, you could try the Belgian - which is a tropical country's take on the waffle. The texture of the waffle itself is a bit chewy but the flavours work so nicely together. At Scotts Road they have the Caribbean waffle with passionfruit, which is lovely as well. They have an adequate menu of coffee and milkshakes etc, but with their portion sizes I'd advise you to share the heavier beverages. The only thing that I found completely ridiculous is that they charge 10$ for Orange Juice!! And I even found a pip in mine the first and last time I ordered it.Service has usually been presented with a smile, and they are child friendly. Go enjoy!",

    "text": "We had the Tunisian and the Parisienne. The Tunisian was a spicy tomato stew served in a small skillet with merguez sausage and a couple of eggs on top with toast on that side. It was good but small. I was still hungry afterwards. The Parisian was kind of like a croque monseiur in that there was a soggy sandwich with cheese and ham in the middle, then it was topped with two eggs and I think Hollandaise sauce. It felt like a variation on eggs benedict. I went there with a Korean girl from the countryside and she felt right at home because its ambiance is similar to cutesy kitsch coffee shops with lounge chairs. I really wanted a fresh squeezed orange juice but I didn't want to pay $9 for it.",

It is one of the upmarket all day breakfast and you would have guess the food is on the pricey side. During high tea hours , the queue can get extremely long and I was there once where the waitress informed me the waiting time is 1 hour. The interior design has a woody touch, giving a homely feeling. The food comes in different type of cuisine menu. For example the European style, Mediterranean style and many others which you have to see from the ordering counter.Personally I would recommend the European , it is served with bacon, poached eggs and sandwiches. Try to avoid the flower tea as it tastes like syrup water. In all, this place does serve quality food and great ambience , but if you are on a tight budget you might want to visit food for thought or the hatched for a all day breakfast fix.",

It was glorious - the amount of eggs and sausages and all towering on the plates, of course my expectations went waaaay up.Upon reaching the place, we saw this long list of country names scrawled on blackboards - why do ALL new and upcoming restaurants love using blackboards as their menus these days ah? But anyways, there was an iPad at the counter, allowing you to swipe and check out what each breakfast set looks like. Not very helpful not very fast, especially since we were a group of 8 people. Luckily I already knew what I wanted. The English breakfast set.It was okay - very fulfilling, with emphasis on FILLING, small wonder that some of my friends found it too oily and heavy. The music that was playing then was kind of headache-y, it sounded like the repetitive null and heavy beats that Inception has towards the end of the movie when all the dreams fall apart.They don't take reservations by the way.",

So, my 2-person party kept getting pushed as multiple 4-person parties would put their names down and were seated before us. Forty-five minute wait become almost 2 hours on one occasion.",

Its not the MOST original but its served up well and is very tasty. I loved the tunisian and the mexican. They serve up good coffee but its not really the reason to come. I do admit the lines can get long and they dont take reservations. The service isnt stellar but you have to go up and order your food anyways. The staff is nice but one thing I noticed is that you cant just sit and enjoy coffee and conversation after youre done. They pretty much come by and ask you to leave if you take to long. Not exactly the most welcome feeling. \u00a0But really you come here for the food in a nice comfy setting.",

The only downside I have ever experienced with this chain is their sub-par customer service, long lines (but you can make reservations at Scotts!), and inordinate prices. Perhaps if the waitstaff were more attentive, I wouldn't feel as bad hashing out so much dough for breakfast...but they're not, so don't expect to be waited on courteously or promptly.

I thought the other dishes such as the Tunisian was more interesting. But I found it spicy and not my preference to kick start the day with fire!I had the grapefruit juice with my breakfast.

I tell you what I never seen a croissant loaded so well. \u00a0My buddy had ordered a side of bacon. When it came out it wasn't the two or three pieces that that the US usually has but a literally boat dish full of fresh cut bacon.

I got the greek which was supposed to be a moussaka, but it was just eggs with tomato sauce, some minced meat and feta cheese. I mean, it was good, but not what I expected from reading the menu and also not the best I ever had. I would say this place is good for if you just wanna have chill time, be able to sit down for a while, get a few coffees and maybe if you wanna get some workdone too.",

My friend had the NORWEGIAN (eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, avocado and grilled asparagus), and I had the I LOVE NEW YORK(scrambled eggs with smoked sturgeon and sesame bagel). You must be wondering why I remember so clearly LOL. Its because I had the Instagram picture.

I had the European breakfast - essentially poached eggs, prosciutto ham & grilled mushrooms on toasted brioche topped with hollandaise sauce. A glass of champagne + breakfast + cappuccino came up to SG$55 so it wasn't cheap but go ahead and treat yourself!",

My husband got the hangover sandwich and fries. He really enjoyed his food as well. The decor is really nice! Pleasant atmosphere, and very clean. The only reason i wouldn't give this 5 Stars is because the service wasn't great. I will give the benefit of the doubt that our waiter was new, but he wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu and he also wasn't attentive. We had to ask other waitstaff to assist us a few times.

It filled my stomach, but I wasn't too hungry to begin with. There was barely any buffalo mozzarella on it, but ample mushrooms and artichoke. The Italian salad that came with it fit into a tiny ramekin - one you'd use for holding ketchup or a sauce.Like I've probably mentioned in my review for the outlet at Scotts Square, I like it for the ambience. I love the quirky furniture and plush armchairs. But it's a much better brunch place at least for me. It's a bit too dark for my liking at night and almost all the items on the menu contain poached or scrambled eggs, salads, or sandwiches, which I seldom crave for dinner. Having said that, the prices are more suited for dinner.",

I am very impressed by their very own baked beans that don't come out of a can, unlike most places.I wouldn't recommend the Norwegian, just because the eggs are iffy and get cold very quickly. It's sort of overpriced for just two strips of smoked salmon enveloping two eggs on very thick-cut toast. When it gets cold, the toast feels like cardboard with the weird, cold yolk/sauce on it. Canadian - not everyone loves the sweet-and-salty combination, but I do! Pancakes and bacon - yes yes yes!My pet peeve on the weekend is the excruciating waiting time for brunch, so go on a weekday for dinner, and book a place online on the webpage.

    "text": "Wild Honey in Mandarin Gallery is one of these places that seems to be extremely popular with a lot of people and when I finally visit I can just not really get what all the fuss is about. The focus is on all-day breakfast and that is something I am a fan of - we were however here early in the morning as we were meeting friends who have kids waking up early. That also fits well with us believing they do not take reservations, apparently they do that now (they previously only done it at their other location but now also here)The style of the place is very much that I would expect to see in an American franchise of restaurants but at least we had comfortable seats. When I started browsing the menu I did find a \u00a0lot of things that sounded interesting. The concept of having different types of breakfast menus from around the world is a good one. I tried the English with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, mushrooms, breakfast potatoes, grilled tomato and brioche.It was also coming with beans but I asked if it could removed and that they could add something extra of the other things - response was that it was not possible to add anything but they would try to remove it but could not promise. Still decided to go for it and that was a mistake. Bacon was soggy, scrambled eggs felt pre-made and the mushrooms and tomatoes did not feel fresh. Sausages and brioce were however ok. Others around the table were more happy but cannot for sure say if it was a result of lower standards or better food but I will admit that the Canadian looked good.For the coffee I ordered a French press and it took forever and then it appeared on the table. My first question was how long it should still brew (when to press it down and pour into the cup) - waitress was just looking at my as if was crazy and said it does not matter and this had been standing around for a while. I tried explaining to her that coffee may taste differently depending on how long it actually is brewed but just got the response that she does not drink coffee. I tasted it and it was just so over-extracted and bitter so it was undrinkable. Had to send it back and instead asked for a cappuccino - that was actually pretty good.We also sampled some of the pastries and those were better but nothing special. In general I was not very impressed by food nor service and then taking into account it is hugely busy and prices are a bit higher than other brunch places I cannot really see any good reason to visit again unless I am dragged here with friend.",

The food is good though I'm always pretty disappointed with their eggs benedict cos the egg yolk dont flow! :( But overall taste is good and servings are HUGE. I can never finish a set on my own.Compared to their other outlet at Scotts Square, this original outlet is a lot smaller and tables are really close. The last evening my friends and i were there, we could hear 2 guys talk about molecular science topics so passionately beside us. While we werent really entertained (sorry, molecular science isnt really our cup of tea) but we were very happy that they actually found each other having such great interest in a topic that few would really like to talk about over dinner. Isnt that sweet! :)They also have a new queue system now so you could key in the no. of pax into this tablet at the entrance of the restaurant, leave your name and contact no and you will receive a e-queue no via your HP. Instead of having to wait at the door, you can roam ard the mall till you receive the phone call when your table is available.Till the day i finish all the breakfasts on the menu, every dining experience will be an adventure!",
