Very tender, boneless chicken that is not just spicy, and numbing, but truly fragrant and smoky as well. Salty, but not overly so, and not at all greasy (for a fried dish). After I eat all the obvious chunks of chicken, I'll spend another 5 minutes picking through all of the chilis to find the tiniest crunchy bits because it is that flavorful and addictive. Be warned though, if you ask for it spicy, the *will* make it spicy, even if you are an ang mo! (No need to emphasize that no, actually you know what you are doing and you actually do want it very very spicy, which is the only way I can usually get a scoop of chili around here.) I enjoy the cleaner/newer than a hole-in-the-wall interior, and when you get take away, they will cut the corner of the container so that the fresh out of the wok chicken stays crispy in transit!UPDATE: I have now also had the mala chicken dry hot pot. Have to say that even though we ordered it at the highest spice level, it was not nearly as spicy as the la zi ji, AND it was not particularly ma la. (Lacking in the ma) It was good, but not a party in my mouth. Five stars for the la zi ji though.",

    "text": "Living in Singapore you get exposed to a lot of foods that we from the west would consider... irregular. Things like Turtle Soup, Chicken Feet, Eel Skin Crisps, Pig Organ Soup, the list goes on and on but sometimes you find a dish that might sound familiar yet different and tastes amazing. We walked by a lively little restaurant called FAT BIRD and were intrigued, the slogan is \"Chong Qing Chicken Hot Pot\" and each table has a camping stove on it with a Claypot filled to the brim with meats, veggies and goodness. We decided to give it a shot and I'm glad we did, the hot pot was amazing.There are two styles available: regular and spicy fragrant and you can choose your level of spiciness: mild, medium or extreme. Next you choose the size: small or large, the meat: Chicken, Pork or Fish and then you choose all the veggies, noodles and/or rice. A few minutes later a big claypot comes out filled with everything that your ordered and you happily eat away as it bubbles on your camping stove. The kicker here is the broth, rich, spicy and complex. I could go back just for the amazing broth alone but mixed with the chicken and veggies - it was outstanding. Price wise it's a winner as well, we had the large Chicken soup for three, lots of veggies, rice & noodles as well as three lime juices and including tax and tip, the bill was $60. For the record, we couldn't finish the pot of soup.If you feel like a casual and interactive dinner out with friends and want something reasonably priced as well, then I highly recommend FAT BIRD. It's a tasty night out that is sure to leave your stomach satisfied.",

    "text": "Craving for hot pot? Fat Bird offers a distinctive dining experience in this aspect, treating you to braised chicken simmering in generous amounts of delicious sauce. It's very much like a steamboat, with the main difference being that your soup base is dark sauce with a customisable spiciness level: mild, medium, and hot. You can order a host of side dishes such as enoki mushrooms and lotus root, and these will be added to your hot pot upon serving.Since Fat Bird comes from the same people who gave us the unique and tantalising food at Chong Qing Grilled Fish, we anticipated that the spiciness of the soup would be above normal levels, and so we opted for the mild level. The choice turned out to be the right one, for even this mild version sent us fetching for cups of Jia Jia Liang Teh!The interior of the restaurant provides a cosy setting in which you could talk for hours over the bubbling pot of soft, tender chicken. A definite choice when thinking about where to head for dinner with a large group of friends!",

    "text": "This restaurant has the same owners as Chong Qing Grilled Fish, which pretty much assured me of the high standards there. Fat Bird's house specialties include the Chicken Hotpot and Spicy and Fragrant Pork Rib Pot where you can pick your own level of spiciness. Feeling greedy that day, I decided on ordering both the house specialties - spicy kampong chicken hot pot and spicy pork rib pot. I know, both dishes were spicy and were asking for it. The chicken hotpot was phenomenal. The chicken was smooth, tender and had so much flavor concealed within. The spicy broth provided the needed kick. The pork ribs were tender too and probably had been stewed prior to that. The portions were rather large and the hotpots were served on top of small gas stove to keep warm throughout, which was a considerate gesture.",
