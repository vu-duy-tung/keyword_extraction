    "text": "Came here after work on a mission to fulfill a sudden craving for Caesar salad, and... Missed the day menu by 2 hours (I was there at 6). But the dessert special (churros) convinced me to stay. It's one of those treats that are so difficult to find in Singapore that I always jump at the chance to try some whenever the opportunity arises, although previous attempts have been somewhat dismal.Churros took a bit long to arrive (from my seat facing the kitchen, it seemed as though this applied to all the food in general) but exceeded my expectations. For just $8 (disclaimer: I consider any reasonably-sized dessert priced below $25 affordable.... Unless its just a slice of cake), I got 5 large sticks of churros. These were nice and crisp on the outside and perfectly moist within, substantial but not too dense. It came with a generous cup of chocolate sauce for dipping in, and some salt at the side. Tip: dip the churros in the chocolate, then dab on a bit of salt. The interplay between the sweet and savory flavours when you do that makes the dessert so much more interesting!Appreciated the service, I was there alone and the staff went out of their way to make me feel welcome, by engaging me in polite conversation and constantly checking if there was something else I needed (and sharing their thoughts about the churros!) Although the cafe was getting crowded, not once did I feel like I was being rushed to complete my meal.Will return soon for the sarnies and that elusive Caesar salad!",

    "text": "ZOMG. How did I not know that Yelp had hit the shores of Singers? Well, this can only mean one thing -- I'm returning with a vengeance!!!! To commemorate, today's lunch choice gets a bit of Yelp love... if only because I'm currently wired from the espresso and happily chomping down on my chicken pesto salad from Sarnie's. Just take it as I'm in a good mood. This cozy little shop is a reliable lunch spot -- with classic salads and sandwiches to get your mid-day fix. The bread is addictively good so don't complain when your sandwiches come with massive slabs -- you'll thank them, I promise. Oh, they make their own coffee blend -- so a perfect caffeine fix for the sleep-deprived. Staff is friendly so even when it gets busy, you never seem to mind. The steady stream of expat regulars seems to attest to this. I'm fast becoming one of them.",

    "text": "A very Australian reminiscent spot not just in name, but in coffee and sarnies (sambos, sammies, sandwiches.... whatever you want to call it) too. The sandwiches are MASSIVE with each bread slice the equivalent of 3 normal slices of bread I estimated. Hence the $12-15 price tag. I recommend sharing a sandwich and having heard rave reviews about the brownie, sharing a sweet 'something-something' too. My roast chicken sandwich was yummy, with LOTS of chicken. I wish the guacamole was a bit more chunky than thinly spread, but hey you win some you lose some. The chicken schnitz and also the ham sarnies looked appealing. Soups and salads too.My flat white was pretty damn good. $5 a pop. Have to walk kind of through the kitchen to get to the toilets, which is a bit naff, but it's a small shop... service is fast and friendly. I'll definitely go back if I'm craving a blemmin good sandwich or carbo loading for a marathon (who am I kidding, only the former).",

Everything is made in-house including the bread, roasting of coffee beans, relish, bacon etc. The sandwich came and it was humongous!!! I was a little worried I won't be able to finish it but when I took one bite, I knew I'd finish the whole thing (and I did!). The sarnie was AMAZE-BALLS! The bread was crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. The bacon...oh my word...the bacon was all kinds of yummy! It was crispy without being oily and was sweet & savory at the same time. Best. Bacon. Ever. The tomato relish brought the whole sarnie together. The white coffee was delicious. It packed a flavor punch without having the typical bitter aftertaste of coffee. \u00a0All in all, what a great food experience! My friend raved about the pesto. I can't wait to go back and try that!",

    "text": "This is a great sandwich joint (serves other foods as well) that serves awesome and wholesome sandwiches with fresh ingredients and most importantly at very affordable prices. My favourite has got to be the steak because they added mustard and makes the meal so tangy and yummy especially with my favourite mushrooms too.Moving on to desserts, the brown little square of brownie is my favourite as it is so chewy and full of flavour, and they sized it just right so you would not get sick of the cake after awhile. Best of all it is not too sweet, just the right amount of chocolate and sweetness.Overall i think they sell value for money food with the right portion and price. Very good choice for a good dinner.",

The only thing I don't love is the (slightly) expensive nature of the dishes...$20+ \u00a0for a brunch entree? Sigh... But I can't knock off a star for this because I still keep coming back. The food delivers, and the service is way above-par for Singapore, especially for a casual spot.My favorites include:- Pesto chicken salad (I have this for lunch on a weekly basis)- Brunch muesli bowl with yogurt and honey (it is to DIE for)- Steak sandwich (or any of the sandwiches, really)The Sarnies folk have also been kind enough to put together a hodgepodge of side dishes into one breakfast entree for me: scrambled eggs, sliced tomato, grilled mushrooms, avocado, and the fabulous Sarnies toasted bread. Best breakfast I've had in a long while.",

    "text": "I've been to Sarnies now, and with my office just around the corner, I'll probably be back a few more times. Prices a little steep. A sandwich or salad ranges from about $13-$15, and an iced tea is a staggering $7. That said, the sandwiches and salads that I've had have been HUGE. Like, too big to put in your mouth HUGE for the sandwich (yeah that's what she said) and I was surprised I was STILL EATING HUGE for the salad. So I've seen the steak sandwich, the roast chicken sandwich, and the chicken pesto salad first hand, and they're all huge. A main in and of themselves huge. Worth the price? Ehmmmmm close. Portions wise definitely, quality wise really on the border definitely.I highly recommend the pesto chicken salad. Chicken pesto salad. Whatever. There're mushrooms, pesto, TONS of chicken, plenty of greens, cherry tomatoes, and a big slab of bread. You'll notice I've been using a lot of capitalisation in this review. Portions here just FEEL LIKE THAT. IN YOUR FACE. As for their $7 iced teas, it's pricey, but they are quite delicious. The green tea with honey and ginger, the orange with cinnamon are both subtly flavoured and very thirst-quenching. Okay, a little wallet hurting, but I like iced tea so I've usually been able to convince myself that it's worth it. (It's not, not really... I'm really good at lying to myself.)The coffee's decent, but the staff. The staff are friendly, and really cool. They really try to engage you, they make sure to smile, and it really feels like they're having fun as they work through the lunch crush. So if you're in the area and a little stumped for what to eat, I'd give Sarnies a try. They're a little pricey, but it's a very very pleasant experience.",

Sure how it could constitue a hearty salad. My greek salad was mot well spun resulting in alot of water in the bowl, making the vegetable soggy and unpleasant. However, the service was commendable. We reflected the problems, and they were taken back, and replaced. We even had a free muffin on the house with a staff checking if the replacement was okay.Perhaps it wasn't a good day that we had visited since most items sold out by the time we reached there. It does have alot potential though, and i would try it again if i were in the area.",

Since opening almost a year ago, the place has really grown and has a strong following with the office crowd around the neighborhood, most of whom are expats. They serve great breakfasts here. Try their homemade muesli with vanilla yogurt. The yogurt is super yummy and made with real vanilla pods. Lunch can get pretty crowded here and they have a variety of sandwiches served on brown or white bread. They even sell alcohol here and after work, they serve some bar food like quesadillas They also recently started serving brunch during the weekends, which I have yet to try. Staff here is super friendly as well, and really get to know the customers.",

The staff are polite and quick, and the coffee art is excellent. The food and drinks menu are full of variety and can bend to any taste. However, it is small, and you can easily walk straight past it. Heck, we almost did. Inside, it's a bit dim in terms of lighting, and it's a bit cramped so it's best to sit outside. The seating is a bit uncomfortable, but is easy to sit in long enough that it shouldn't be too much of a problem. A pretty good spot for a quick coffee, but probably not best to stay for a long time. Smokers will sometimes smoke near the area, but it doesn't happen often. Definitely recommend it.",

Let's face it, who can?This bad boy features grass fed cut steak, amazing saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, onion, mixed greens and an in-house tangy steak sauce to round out all those flavours.To finish up we shared the Coconut cocowhip (think low-fat ice cream/yoghurt) which was a perfect end to the meal to cleanse the palate and refresh us both from the simmering SG heat.For a lunchtime haunt Sarnies is highly recommended.

    "text": "It's my 50th review! , Sarnies definitely brings me back to Australia. From the d\u00e9cor, to the vibe, to the food - rustic, unpretentious and delicious with the use of fresh ingredients, portion is HUGE and the coffee is good. The cafe concept is hassle free too. Just walk straight to the counter, grab the menu and order right there. You will be given a card which is also your order number so grab a table and the friendly staff will bring your food over once it's ready. If the weather is not crazily hot, I will always opt to sit outside, away from the open kitchen inside the caf\u00e9. I came here twice - first on a busy weekday for lunch and second on a quieter weekend brunch. The sandwiches here are to die for and totally value for money. On the first visit, I had the smoked salmon sandwich while my boss had the steak with mushroom and caramelised onions sandwich, both selling at $13.90 and $15.50, respectively. Both sandwiches came with generous portion of filling (mine with lots of smoked salmon pieces on creamy dill sauce) and it sure filled me up until dinner. Unfortunately, the sandwiches are only available on weekdays and they have an entire different menu on weekend and dinner. On my second visit, it was a Saturday post gym brunch with my friend. I ordered the smoked salmon (again!) and scrambled eggs served on sourdough, while my friend ordered bacon and egg served on a mini baguette. While the dishes were executed perfectly, I thought the price was slightly on a higher side for brunch food. We paid almost $30 each for a main and a drink, hence I minus one star for this review. Even the dinner price ranges from $10 to $15 only. That's bizarre when it should be the other way around. \u00a0The caf\u00e9 is open every day - Mon to Fri until 9pm, and weekends until 4pm, so swing by if you're around the area and give it a try. I'm sure you'll like it as much as I do.",

I went at lunch time so of course it was crowded, which I expected. The problem was that the place was so tiny!! Everyone was kinda crammed in a tiny sweaty line, even though we were indoors with aircon/fan, to line up to place our orders. IF you were lucky to find a place to sit, it wasn't that comfy and you would still overheat. I got this chicken sandwich without the bacon, and even though it tasted good, the bread was I guess too weak (?) to hold everything together so I just ended up cobbling my own little open sandwich with the bits and pieces of the original sandwich. My sandwich also had guacamole, which I'm PRETTY SURE was packaged. I feel like I've bought it before and ate it at home... Which was disappointing to say the least... At least the orange juice was nice..?",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this cute hole-in-the-wall gem with the whole package of dim lighting, exposed kitchen, cute decor, large tables...but it was unfortunately quite subpar for dinner, at least. If I come here again (though I probably will not), id just get coffee & hang out here! Seating is limited as mentioned in other Yelp reviews with 2 longer benches & tables seating 6 ppl, and a few more tables for 2. Service was friendly, and the iced latte ($5) I ordered was good!! It had a strong espresso taste, the way I like it. The food unfortunately was lacklustre. We ordered 2 Thai disco spaghetti & 2 aglio olio. I expected a fusion dish of Thai basil beef with pasta but unfortunately it wasn't great. The texture of the spaghetti was kind of rubbery, and perhaps another type of pasta would be better suited to enhance the taste more. The beef was the sort of minced beef in bolognese, and was quite salty. The spiciness and vaguely tom-yum taste was there, but that was all. From trying my friend's portion, the aglio olio seemed pretty solid and garlicky with a generous serving of prawns, so perhaps it's the better choice. Another table ordered the satay chicken and it was three sizable slabs of grilled chicken (with no sides though). We also tried to use the Entertainer 1 for 1 app for main courses, and they only allowed 1 use of it I.e only 1 dish was free for the 4 of us (not 2 dishes).",

Staff remembers faces so you don't have to keep your receipt, very convenient for people in a hurry.The aubergine and hummus sandwich had a generous spread of hummus on both side of the bread, and the aubergine was cooked until soft and tender. Overall the sandwich was huge and tasty, I could have this everyday if I were a vegan.The pesto salad was even better. Maybe I just needed some meat! The chicken breast was nicely cooked and mixed with the pesto dressing so it was not dry at all. The mixed greens inside was coated with olive oil which we'll complemented the pesto dressing. Definitely a big portion that can fill you as a meal!",

    "text": "This place is without a doubt one of the best brunch places in Singapore. The cafe has a really small and cozy indoor dining area which can be a little claustrophobic at their peak period. But fret not, their outdoor dining area is pretty spacious and being located along Telok Ayer Street, you get to appreciate the well-restored, heritage shop-houses that lined the street as your dining view.When I'm there, I get my usual Bacon & Egg Sarnie with Tomato Relish with an add-on of Avocado! The combination of all that is just heavenly (I am even thinking about it right now as I'm typing this!). The serving is really generous; if you're a female, you could easily share it with another girlfriend of yours. Some of the other recommended dishes will be the Either the Homemade Granola or Pancakes with Berries, Honey and Greek Yoghurt.And before I forget, their coffee is fantastic too so don't missed that out! I'm can't wait to go back there again for brunch already. x",

They big breakfast or whatever they call it was a awesome plate of food. Prices are crazy high but at least portions can claim to justify it. They serve a good cup of coffee and overall is a great place for a nice brunch or brekkie. The place is so small you most likely won't get a seat if you came in a group of three or more. Prices are no joke so make sure you already got this month's pay in the bank before you head down there!",

Apparently it's cool to be snobbish. This was on a lazy weekday evening with a thinning crowd and not much going on. Stood there for almost 4 minutes. Just me. No one else. Looks like my friendly smile was too much and too uncool for these punk ass kids. I'll take my business elsewhere, thank you very much. I hear \"FREE THE ROBOT\" makes decent coffee around the corner. I work around here and tend to drink a lot of coffee. Wait up for a review.",

    "text": "Ever since i moved to telok ayer for work, I notice there is always a lot of people enjoying their coffee outside Sarnies when I walk to work in the morning. \u00a0Putting aside the question of why so many people can have a sit-down breakfast during normal working hours on a weekday, I am curious about Sarnies' breakfast offerings. I have allowed my curiosity to build up until one morning last week when I found myself particularly free and decided to venture inside Sarnies.As i pushed the door and stepped in, I seem to have walked from Telok Ayer to England, perhaps some cute little cafe in East London. I could not help notice that the overwhelming majority of the clientele is angmoh and just a second ago, I was surrounded by the laughter of uncles enjoying their kopi at the kopitiam next door so wow! that was a bit unexpected.The set up is simple, there is a huge counter where you order and get your food and drinks and then a few tables and chairs against the wall and filling up the rest of the limited space. \u00a0A lot of people seem to opt for the outdoor seats which is a pretty good spot for people watching on the busy strip of telok ayer. \u00a0Having quickly scanned the menu on the board, I decided to get the salmon cream cheese bagel since I have not had a bagel for a while (actually never in Singapore to be accurate). \u00a0I was a bit disappointed that I could not choose the type of bagel. It is definitely not cheap, my bagel came at a cost of almost S$10 and with a flat white that brings the total damage to 14. I mean, to be fair, the bagel is huge and if you are willing to pay 10 for a sandwich in the cbd this is acceptable but still, $14 for breakfast seems a bit on the high side. \u00a0I opted to bring my bagel back to the office since the place is too packed. \u00a0Delighted to find that they have taken the time to wrap my bagel up in foil so by the time I sat down at my desk and opened the wrapping, it's still nice and warm. \u00a0The bagel itself is pretty good, soft and smooth cream cheese that blends well with the salmon and the portion is quite generous. \u00a0I really enjoyed it so quality wise I cannot complain. I heard their brunch menu is pretty good so will come back and try.",

I have tried both the Caesar salad (good yoghurty dressing with some herbs) and the Halloumi salad (too salty!) here, and I have heard the bread is great too. \u00a0The Caesar portion is large but I still do not think it is worth the price, unless you're itching to spend $15-$17 for a salad! My main concern with this place is that the last time I ate here (had the Halloumi salad), I got food poisoning! \u00a0Regardless of their fancy spins on salads, I don't think I will risk it again and definitely not for the exorbitant cost!",
