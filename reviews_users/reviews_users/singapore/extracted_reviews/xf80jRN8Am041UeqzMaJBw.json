I also love how you get unlimited broth refill.Located inside The Centrepoint and even though I went in when it was almost closing time, the service was still very good. The servers were very efficient and attentive.10/10 would recommend everyone eating here!",

We had a side of salted vegetable (just okay), and also a pork belly dish in a stone pot that was pretty tasty. \u00a0While I wouldn't mind coming back, it wouldn't be the first place I came to when going to Singapore.",

    "text": "The outlet was newly opened and located in quite hidden location at the level 2 of the shopping centre. Menu and wet tissue was served after I was showed to a table. One could reject the wet tissue as it is chargeable. The condiments such as sliced chilli, dark soya sauce, light soya sauce, chilli sauce can be found at the divider by the table. There was also a teapot and hot water from the tap on the divider to brew tea. There was a pail available for the bones.Pork Ribs Soup ($7)Served in a traditional rooster bowl with 2 ribs and garlic.The pork ribs was quite tender. The soup was peppery. The soup was refillable. A staff would go around with a kettle to refill the soup. Throughout the meal, the staff refilled twice for me without being reminded.Braised Chicken Feet with Beancurd Skin ($4)The chicken feet was very tender and melt in the mouth. The beancurd skin was not bad too.Mee Sua ($2.50)Its texture was quite smooth and light.Do take note of your table when making payment at the cashier. By the way there was a 7% GST and 1% service charge on the bill. Staffs were friendly and service was fast.",

Stop being so petty please. Service is ehh... but I can't help but feel like the taste of the soup in this branch is inferior to the one across from Central in Clarke Quay. Maybe it's just me.",

    "text": "Relatively new branch of Song Fa that I would recommend people to go to instead of the original stall (the one at New Bridge Road). It is much roomier than the New Bridge while still offering same quality (you know, they don't suffer from the degraded quality that is common as restaurants expand)Onto the food. They serve Bak Kut Teh (duh) in the style that I prefer. The soup is peppery and one could definitely taste that the broth came from hours of boiling pork bones. On top of that, they do have unlimited broth refills, so don't be sad if you're running out of the delicious soup, they would refill it for free. On top of that, there are other side dishes, which are common offerings in most BKT stall. The side dishes are all fine but I think the dough fritters deserves a special mention. Their dough fritters are crispy without being oily, which complements the soup very well. Another thing that one may want to note, they serve 2 kinds of tea. One is the common teabags and the other one is the traditional chinese tea (complete with all the chinese tea set, you know the one with the small cups).",
