    "text": "With the promise of delicious steaks and free-flow fries ahead, I could barely hide my excitement when taking a seat amongst Les Bouchons' auburn honey dining room. Although the setting is white linen tablecloths and classically French, there were no glares from fellow patrons or staff as three old friends gathered and joked nearly as much as they ate. The Os A Moelle/Bone Marrow with Toast is the must order Entree ($18) - definitely some of the best bone marrow I've ever had! Make sure you order an extra serve of thin, crisp toast too - the warm and springy rolls from the bread basket just don't do this dish justice! As far as Steaks go, I thoroughly enjoyed the Grilled Rib Eye with Vigneron Butter ($38.80) and Grilled Sirloin with Herbs ($38.80) - it was very classic and kept simple to highlight the steaks, which were both cooked to a perfect medium rare. The house made fries are so crisp and moreish, but ironically enough - we were so full that we gave the endless supply a miss. The only disappointment was the Cr\u00e9me Caramel Maison ($12) which was all booze and no caramel crackle - which, in my opinion, is the best part of a cr\u00e9me caramel! Be prepared to spend a little over $60/pp for three courses but I'd definitely pop by again for just the steaks alone.I highly recommend enjoying the sights and sounds of the scenic walk back into Clarke Quay after a hearty meal at Les Bouchons - there's no better way to work off those juicy calories, then to enjoy good company in the cool evening breeze!",

The pesec leognan wine was a perfect combination with the salmon. The salad and the fries were very good as well. The waiter knew the wine and the food pairing and made a great suggestion! I am definitely coming back again!",

    "text": "When it comes to Entrecote-style steak places I tend to do in with very low expectations... so with that in mind, I wasn't exactly 'disappointed' with Les Bouchons Rive Gauche.Let's talk about the good first. The steaks are generally excellent value. The amount of meat you're getting for the price you pay? Plus free flow fries? And deliciously crisp and fluffy fries at that? It's a great place for the hungry meat eater.The desserts are HUGE. We had... something. It was a sundae of chocolate and vanilla and it was delicious chocolate sauce (the real stuff, not chocolate-flavoured nonsense), ice cream, and basically it fed four already very full people quite comfortably.Why just two stars after that though?Our steaks were all underdone. We ordered one rare, two medium rare, and one medium, and I think I can safely say that they were all roughly one step under-cooked. My rare was closer to blue, but that's splitting hairs really and overall I was happy with it. The medium rares and mediums though, those were noticeably undercooked. When a medium steak still has slightly translucent glossy bits of meat, that's definitely underdone. The beurre cafe de Paris was absent, and while some other (not very tasty) butter was provided instead, they was definitely a little stingy with it.Beyond the steak, the terrine was possibly one of the worst, worst worst terrines I've had in my life. Yes, including the ones you buy from a supermarket, or the ones you find in an international buffet. This one was barely edible, and I'd highly recommend you give it a miss.So after all that, would I still recommend Les Bouchons? Sure.Great value steak, great fries, and wonderful desserts. Recipe for a good evening here: skip the starters, order your steak slightly overcooked because it'll turn up undercooked (net result = just right) and then use the remaining space to have one of their gigantic desserts to yourself.I might go back... except none of the people that i went with want to.",

    "text": "This was the first French restaurant i went to and was a good exposure for my taste buds, quite tantalising food. I normally like to eat steak and it was one of the better medium priced steaks I had eaten in Singapore. They serve free flow of fries along with the meals and the bread there is excellent as well, a good way to stop you from eating more fries.Ambience was quite good because it was facing the river and you could eat and chit chat and chill out facing the water. One of the things that turned me off was the service and it was really bad. The restaurant opens on the dot and even if you were early the manager and waitresses would just stare at you until it is time for opening.The service rendered was terrible and the staffs were very arrogant and had no idea what customer service is. I would go back to the place probably after awhile but definitely not too often.",

    "text": "Came down for a company dinner based on recommendation from a colleague. If you are need a good amount of meat, maybe with some sides, maybe with some wine, but meat, more importantly - this is the place for you.There was a number of us so we got various cuts along with a grilled meat platter. We ended passing our different cuts of meats around - not quite the best of dining habits but 'twas good to be able to try the different cuts for starters. I liked the slight charred taste to their steaks, which adds a nice kick to the bite. My lamb was unfortunately just that bit too rare for my liking but otherwise, the beef is good. You may get tempted by fanciful sounding other names on the menu (like I did) but just get your favourite cut and you can't go wrong. Test it out with the different sauces - mustard, honeygrain mustard, etc.Now that we got the meat part aside, you get to start your meal with unlimited buns. You also get unlimited salads and frites to go with your steaks. They were good, but the steaks stole the show. We didn't go for refills in the end. Expect to fork out around $60/pax. Quite alright if you're looking to indulge. I've read a couple of compaints about the service. Though the staff was quite alright, just wish they didn't make it like it was a bad thing not to wine with the steak. I mean, all I wanted was just meat.",

    "text": "I should have followed my first instinct when there was no answer at Les Bouchons when I called at 5pm to reserve a table inside....We arrived on a balmy, but clear skied Tuesday night around 7pm and found the outside tables very nice. When asked if we had a reservation I said we had tried but there was no answer......before I could finish speaking...the Chinese Singaporean Maitre'd said that was ok, there were plenty of tables outside. We said wonderful we would take a table outside and I mentioned I would like to see the inside just for my curiosity. \u00a0I was body blocked at the doorway and told we had to \"go outside, go outside, go outside.....no tables inside\"....The wait staff looked sheepish and so we began our dining experience at Les Bouchons Rive Gauche....The menu is as other reviewers have described. Beef steaks of various cuts and sizes. A marinated lamb dish is also available. We passed on desserts based on previous reviews. All reasonably priced. The wine list of 10 whites and 10 reds is adequate but as expected, weighted to European names. We ordered 2 Ribeyes, a caprese salad, accompanied by a 3rd Cru Pomerol Bordeaux listed as a 2010 vintage. The waitress brought the wine, showed me the label from about 6 feet away. I asked if she could bring it closer and immediately saw it was a 2002. 12 years in the bottle would have only detracted from this wine and I asked if she had the the 2010 as listed. More puzzled looks, more explanations, another offer to pour this vintage \"at the same price\" .. More discussion on why I didn't want the 2002 and after determining they did not have a 2010, I asked if she could please bring the wine list back. We eventually had a wonderfully similar 2012 St Emillion. The steaks and frites were fine. This establishment could be between a 3 and 4 stars based on its food, improvements in its wine list, its location and the fit out. But from my experiences with many Singaporean restaurants with heavy tourist traffic, the evening is ruined by poorly trained front staff and a constant push to turn over the tables quickly while playing Russian roulette with what wine is poured.",

My partner had the Normandy steak but there was nothing special about it other than the portion was huge. I would actually recommend just getting the rib eye. We had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e \u00a0for dessert and was not impressed at all. The sugar on top was too thin and not burnt enough to have that crackling sound and taste and the custard was too soft. Comparing it with another french restaurant with the same theme, I prefer the other place more",
