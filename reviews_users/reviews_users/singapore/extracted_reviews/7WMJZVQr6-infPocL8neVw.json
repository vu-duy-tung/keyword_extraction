    "text": "Another interesting, hip place in Tiong Bahru, the kind that is frequented mostly by expats and local hipsters. It has the feel of an old canteen, reminding me of those desperately-trying-to-look-old, kitsch cantinas so popular in Mexico City, with tiled floors, posters on the walls and vintage marble tables, a bit crammed on the inside. To the untrusting observer, The Tiong Bahru Club may appear to be one of those places where form is more important than essence. However, the environment ultimately works and the place feels strangely authentic and inviting.The first interesting thing are the two different menus: East Asian and North Indian. Both of them contained snippets of information, kind of \"explaining\" the dishes. We were told to choose what kind of menu we wanted to have, so we chose the Indian menu (I'm always keen on Indian food). We had a very good, fragrant and spicy fish curry. Then I tried the masala chicken liver, which was spectacular. It was rich in flavour, while at the same time full of subtle surprises. I could say food tasted almost home-cooked, there was a special level of care involved. There's no way I couldn't love that.It must be hard to keep the balance of style and substance in a restaurant. My first impression of The Tiong Bahru Club was that of a place favouring the former. It is always good to be proven wrong. Here, style is no more than the background to a sense-appealing meal. I will surely come back.",

I took a cappuccino and a Cheese beef burger (22$ ++)The cappuccino is too milky, and when it was served, I don't feel like having ordered a real cappuccino (4 or 4.5 $ ++, see my photo). The minced beef in the hamburger was too salty.When I asked for ketchup, they give you ketchup in small package. I asked mustard twice, because the first time they did not say they don't have mustard, the second time they kind of simulate like they are looking for it then announce that they don't have mustard. Can't they say directly that they dont have if they already know...?About the bread, it seemed to me that they are using first price quality. The burger was not worth 22$",

    "text": "A new upmarket restaurant has opened in Tiong Bahru! I know.. What's new right? Located at the corner of Eng Hoon St. And Seng Poh road, we've seen this place transform from an old coffee shop (our favourite Loo's Hainanese curry rice used to be here) transform into this upmarket eatery. At first glance, this place looked like just another upmarket, snooty diner, filled with expats, yuppies and a certain breed of Singaporean females that have a certain preference for guys I should not name. Anyway... What got us trying this place was the nostalgic feel and the fact that it did not serve the usual eggs Benedict, breakfast sets, waffles or pancakes, and they certainly didn't promote themselves as the next big coffee joint with magical beans from the bottom of the Amazon River. Instead, what this place specializes in is... Indian food and chai!! Surprise surprise! Well.. I guess it made sense considering that the Brits and the Indians / Sikhs have long had a history together. Anyway... I'm a sucker for indian food so this place, despite how hard I tried to say no, still got the better of me. They have 2 sets of menus here, an Asian menu, with fried rice and soto Ayam and an Indian menu. We decided to go for a Murgh Dum Briyani, my favourite Palek Paneer,a Masala Chicken Liver and what better way to wash down our food than with a nice pot of Himalayan Sikkih tea.First came the Briyani. A good sharing portion that could easily feed 2-3 pax. The rice was wonderfully fragrant with the spices and flavours beautifully infused in and the chicken, despite being the breast, was tender and oh-so-flavourful. So good in fact that it just might be one of the best Briyani's I've had in a while. Next was the Masala Chicken liver. Now this dish was the star of our lunch. It is literally to die for! The liver was nice and tender and the sauce, with all its onions and spices was amazing. Every bite was a dream and this dish is enough to bring us back for more. Finally the Paneer, my personal favourite. The sauce was nice and smooth without the spinach being over powering while the cheese was smooth and \"bouncy\". Only thing it could do with was a little more salt, otherwise it was another very good dish. The tea itself was nice and fragrant and proof that chaitime, the guys behind this restaurant, know their teas. Overall, it was s wonderful experience and the only reason this place didn't get a 5 is down to a few simple factors. A) indoor searing was a little tight, with most 4 pax tables nearly touching each other and effectively becoming a 3 top. B) service was slow as well, with the 2 waiters clearly being inexperienced and frankly a little lost most of the time. C) food did take a little longer than it should, with U.S. almost finishing our Briyani by the time the paneer came. D) the prices. A little on the strap side at around $20-$25 per pax for an Indian meal. Overall, I love how they kept some of the coffee shop's elements while updating it, leaving a nice nostalgic feel, down to the music choice. We'll definitely be back for more!",

    "text": "Absolutely delicious Devil's Chicken Curry (at $16.80, a bit on the pricey side) really made my brunch! The sauce was bursting with flavor and spices, and the carrots, pork, and sausages were a fantastic accompaniment. A nice cup of chai went along with it superbly, and it was served with just the right amount of rice. I'm lactose intolerant, and it was lovely to find Indian in Singapore without ghee (clarified butter) so I could eat it! My friend's biryani was delicious too: light and fluffy, tasting of gardens.The outdoor seating was the perfect blend of the aircon from inside and the heat of the sidewalk, with people watching and a good breeze. Decor is cute and appealing - a blend of the club and the chaiwallah stand which both supply the place. The issue was that our server was quite obviously completely new and pretty inept (sorry, buddy, but you were.) He said they offered chai by the pot and let us order some - by the pot - but they only serve it by the glass, as the server who brought it over explained after our mystified glances at the solitary cup. He also said they were offering their Bento Box special but when I tried to order it, turned out that's only available on weekdays. Study your menus and learn your stuff, servers, so that your service can match with your fine establishment's prices.",

Seeing that Chaiholics was serving their tea specialties, we decided to give the chai a go. Firstly, I thought the teas were overpriced. $6.50 excluding taxes. But nonetheless we went for it. If the tea was good, no issues paying. But the tea was a big disappointment. Mainly that it tasted so watered down. \u00a0Additionally the spoons looked quite stained and dirty. We didn't dare use them. Such a shame.",

Am always uncomfortable with that bc yeah it might've seemed cool but was not cool for the majority of those not in the elite. Anyhow it was cool enough in the evening inside and they had mixed chairs and cool wood floor etc. just be careful if ur inside and then you moved your chair back and one leg falls off the elevated floor and u could fall and hit ur head. The food was actually pretty good - the Indian food only. We had chicken not the spicy one and it was juicy and citrusy and delicious. Also had the Dahl and the baigan bartha and naan and plain rice and one more thing. But it was all tasty and very spicy but good. The service was meh. I asked for ginger ale and they said no we don't have it. I pointed out on the menu where it was listed. Was advised they don't have it anymore. Asked what on this list they had. They have juice and coke. There were five more things listed. Ok I'll just have water. Have to flag them down if you want anything so they don't check back. But at least they don't bother you and let u stay to chat. They're not clearing ur plates as soon as ur done which was my experience in most other restaurants in Singapore.",

It is made to authentic north Indian standard, very difficult to come by here in Singapore. Loved the food very much! The ambience is great too. There are always people eating there regardless of what time of the day I go past it. Especially at night. It is however slightly pricey, at about $20-25 an entr\u00e9e and $6-8 for a drink. Total of about $30-35 per person. I'll definitely be going back for more.",

The service was so bad it was comical. I don't see how any restaurant can charge prices like this when they offer such poor or no service. The menu prices were quite expensive.We struggled to get drinks. One waiter barely spoke English and when we did finally manage to order he would take an order \u00a0from 1 out of 7 people and disappear. We'd try to call the waiter back and he would take another order but forget half of the drinks. So we had to send our son to the bar to remind him. Then they ran out of beer. There was wine on the table but noone knew how much it cost.The food we had was OK but nothing to rave about. we only got a few entrees and this was only because my husband ordered them earlier as he had arrived 1/2 hour before \u00a0us. We had to get up and get our own plates as the waiters forgot. \u00a0After we had been in restaurant for 1.5 hrs we asked how our food was going and discovered the order had not been put through. The waiters were inept. We left as we'd run out of patience by then and everyone was grumpy.What was supposed to be a special birthday dinner was a disaster and I had 3 tired hungry children you feed at 9.30 pm.I've had better service in a hawker market for a fraction of the price!",
