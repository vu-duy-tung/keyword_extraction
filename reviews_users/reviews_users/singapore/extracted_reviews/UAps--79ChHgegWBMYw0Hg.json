As we were walking, we saw Jamie's Italian [his new cookbook is coming out soon!] and we decided to give it a shot. I am glad we did. We were seated immediately and water arrived to the table. My friend ordered a coke and I did the same. I ordered the Tuscan pizza-a thin crusted pizza with black olives and two types of Italian sausage and a tomato sauce base. It was spicy with a nice kick but good. My friend ordered the kale salad [done in a Caesar fashion] and the burrata appetizer. Both meals were delicious and we were happy with our choices. It was reasonably priced and I would recommend and return.",

To start I decided to order the nachos and the calamari both of which were fantastic. The nachos especially were really interesting and were bursting with flavor. I also had the famous prawn pasta which is some of the best pasta I have ever had. The atmosphere is really relaxing with great music and friendly staff to boot. I just wish I could have tried out more food!",

Coming in at lunchtime on a weekend it was filled with families. For starters, we ordered a variety of breads. For $7 and the quantity given, it was a better deal than the Ricotta Bruschetta, which is one slice of bread going for $11. I just wish they gave us a bigger dish for the olive oil and balsamic vinegar; the portion was a bit stingy!I really liked my tagliatelle bolognese. The sauce tasted similar to Emeril Lagasse's recipe, with hints of cinnamon. The pasta was perfectly al dente, which I appreciated. The portion was also a lot more substantial than the truffle pasta I tried last time.With a place like this, of course you'll spend a lot. This time I chose a little more wisely which paid off, so I'll give it the extra 1 star.",

The service was quite good although a little in your face when clearing food if I am to be picky. Didn't enjoy the wait staff elbows coming towards my face. I thought the food was a little below par (usually a 4/5 in my book) for Jamie's compared to their Harbourfront sister restaurant, which I have regularly frequented. I had the honeycomb cannelloni in which the pasta was quite dry with half of it not properly cooked. A friend of mines steak was still alive and the starters were a mix of great and average. While it was below a 4/5 we still had a good night and I would visit again for a second try.",

I ordered Happy Lollipop Chicken with high expectations and once taking a bite the chicken was definitely not up to the respect level / rep of this place. The chicken on the stick had sesame seeds and overall had a very unpleasant and undercooked taste. I then decided to give a fries a shot... They were okay, but could be better. The ketchup they gave us was clearly not regular and made the fries taste even worse than they were. The ketchup was miserable and I'm not even sure the waiter brought ketchup. Even the apple juice was an unpleasant experience and just tasted wrong. I thought well that's okay... I'll just try the infamous pizza a shot. I ordered Margarita pizza and the whole thing was tomato sauce on top of bread which tasted disgusting. I asked for more cheese and cheese in general there was close to none. It was just a miserable tasting bread with a miserable amount of tomato sauce on top. I was quite disappointed with my very high expectations here. The pizza is infamous yet when I order it it tasted like half cooked barely even pizza. The cheese on too I had put made it even worse. It was just bad bread with tomato. On top of that, after everything our waiter has the audacity once we order some more fries to accidentally forget to bring it for 20 minutes. We reminded them after the 20, and we just canceled and went somewhere else.Everything here was a mishap, will not be coming back. Unpleasant place in my opinion, sorry.",

The shrimp pasta is ridiculously yummy and I usually order it. This time, I felt like bolognese so I ordered the tagliatelle bolognese in a small size and a side of green beans with garlic. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate praline cake. I washed my meal down with earl grey cucumber tea. The pasta was al debate and sauce was hearty. However, I prefer my bolognese to have a heartier taste that is stewed in red wine with a hint of pancetta and onion. What I'm trying to say is, I prefer my homemade bolognese. But this bolognese is alright. The haricot vert were garlicky and the arabiatta sauce was a bit spicy. The dessert was devoured because it was that gooey, salty and sweet, and chocolate goodness that hit the spot especially for that time of the month when almost every woman craves chocolate. I walked out as happy as a clam.",

    "text": "Salmonella Suspected in Kids Pasta This is a serious topic so I will try to be as factual as possible in my review and also note speculation where appropriate.-My family of four had lunch at Jamie's Italian on 12 December 2015. It was not our first time dining there. One of my sons has eczema that flares up after consuming processed foods or foods with low quality cooking oils. Jamie's was one of a few restaurants in Singapore to which he had no previous allergic reaction. Consequently it was on the short list of restaurants that we frequented regularly.We ordered a burger, which my wife and I shared; a margarita pizza and bread basket, which everyone shared; and a kids pasta with meatballs. The pasta was intended to be shared by our two kids, aged 3 and 1.5. However, only the 1.5 year-old took liking to the pasta, and devoured almost all of it.The next day, the said child who consumed the pasta, had diarrhea in the morning, a fever by 10 am, and a febrile seizure by noon from a spike in his fever to spiked over 40 degrees. (NB: it was his first febrile seizure, and our family has no history of them) He was sent to the Accident & Emergency - eponymous for the ER for those North Americans - and was admitted to the hospital after he stabilized. For two days he had sharp swinging fevers of almost a viral characteristic, leading some nurses suspected dengue, initially. However, stool cultures confirmed Salmonella.No one else in our family contracted the bacterial infection except my son who had the pasta. We all ate the same home-cooked food before and after the meal at the restaurant.The case was reported to the NEA, MOH, and the restaurant.-Of course, we cannot prove that the pasta was tainted with salmonella. We discovered food poisoning to be the cause several days after the meal (as it takes 3-4 days for cultures to be grown). By that time, the restaurant had already thrown out that batch of food, so no testing could be done. I do recall that whilst the noodle itself was quite warm, probably right out of the boiling water, the final assembled dish was somewhat tepid, as the sauce was not that warm. (The meatball was tasteless and cold as well, but that is neither here nor there)Other possible explanations should also be considered. Perhaps it was the tapenade from the bread basket, or, a dirty viewfinder toy, which the kid-friendly restaurant doles out to all patrons with children. I was informed that it is Standard Operating Procedure for the restaurant to sanitize each of the viewfinders at the beginning of the service. That day we received two viewfinders, one for each child (sharing is a problem at this age), and both were noticeably greasy. Or perhaps, by a stroke of sheer bad luck, one server was ill and did not wash his or her hands properly and this one dish was contaminated by fecal matter... I shudder at that thought.There is, of course, the possibility that my child did not acquired salmonella from the restaurant, and instead acquired it from some other source. My child attends montessori school, but has been on school holiday for over a week. Our family includes several doctors. So, we raise our kids in a culture where hygiene and food safety is highly valued. Everyone washes hands after using the toilet, and before and after meals. Our kids eat almost exclusively at home because of his food sensitivity. Perfectly good leftovers are thrown away after 24-hours. One cutting board for vegetables, one cutting board for meats. Food expiry dates are checked, and the fridge purged weekly. Only the freshest ingredients are sourced and inventory turns rapidly. Admittedly, we are somewhat OCD in this regard...Jamie's is of course an internationally recognized brand, which has a reputation to manage, and globally standardized procedures and protocols to control food safety. To their credit, the country manager, Emma, was empathetic and professional in her response to my complaint, explained that 'food safety' was tantamount for their brand, and launched an investigation led by the London food safety team. Borrowing from semiotics, words, are of course are signs that point to idiosyncratic meanings that depend on the context in which they are used. Anyone who has lived in both SE Asia as well as North America or Western Europe, can attest that 'food safety' can mean something totally different in terms of the exact policies required (food spoils so much faster here), and the consistency to which those procedures will be carried out...-As is the case with most isolated food poisoning cases, a direct link between salmonella and the restaurant cannot be proved conclusively. One will notice, however, upon reading other reviews of the establishment, that there are similar complaints. I cannot attest to the validity of other patrons' reviews, and certainly their comments do not lend veracity to my account today. So, I leave it to the discerning readers own minds to judge for themselves.",

But when I dine at a restaurant, I expect restaurant-quality fare, not food that I can recreate in my own kitchen. With the exception of the pizzas, which passed muster, the rest of our samplings were clumsy and unpolished. Suffice it to say, I was plainly unimpressed. There are dozens of Italian restaurants in Singapore more worthwhile than Jamie's Italian.We had: 1) Cauliflower Fritti ($13.50): This was very good, a beautifully golden crust batter and juicy minced cauliflower balls. Ask to hold off the parsley if you're averse, Jamie's Italian puts it on EVERYTHING.2) Prawn Linguine ($18): The sauce, redolent of garlic, shaved fennel, tomatoes, and chilli, was decent enough, and so were the properly cooked fresh prawns, BUT, the pasta was disappointingly overcooked.3) Pizza Funghi ($23.50): the pizzas here are much better than their middling pastas. I liked the contrast of the earthy mushrooms with the richness of the white sauce4) Epic Brownie ($12.50): nice but certainly not \"epic\" as asserted on the menu, even if it was very nicely fudgy",
