    "text": "I had lunch here for the first time today. I made reservations via phone. We had the wild rocket burger, mushroom and cheese burger, coconut and gula melaka milkshake, flat white, onion rings and churros waffle. We both enjoyed our burgers which came with a healthy serving of beef (you can choose how well you want it and medium was perfect for me, also a choice of fries or salad). The milkshake which my friend had was supposedly great, while I prefer my flat white stronger and less acidic. Onion rings were decent with a very tasty curry sauce on the side. I loved the churros waffles though a teensy dry, had a perfect cinnamon sugar coating. Paired with chocolate, it made for a good dessert without tasting overly heavy. Service was really good - staff were attentive and very pleasant. It was a pleasure dining here and I will be back for more. The bill was about $95 for 2 persons.",

But the highlight of the night was the homemade lemonade- it was served in a cute mason jar and was fresh and delish that i was wishing it came in the larger size!- and the service. Our egg's benedict came around 15 minutes later than the burger, and though we didn't make any complaint about it and frankly, we were too busy watching over the baby to even notice, the server came over and apologized for the wait and said the dish was on the house. It was just really nice and thoughtful gesture that you don't see too often in Asia. love the cozy atmosphere, love the food. perfect for dates and for families as well!",

But my bf convinced me otherwise, and happily so :) The blue cheese/pear burger was so much more worth the $20.90 than the $19 B burger at &made! Or I guess I just appreciated the mix of flavours more. Also, love the \u00a0walnut-peanut butter that came with! I'm quite a sucker for chunky nut butters.We also split a thai minced pork basil prata pizza ($11) - very interesting.. very Asian, and very oily. Flavours were pretty good, nice spice and pork bits! But there really was quite a lot of oil.. :/Mushroom soup ($8 or so I believe?) was fairly chunky and full of mushrooms, reminded me of a version that my friend made - basically he just had a pot of different types of mushrooms and stuck an immersion blender in.. voila, mushroom soup! More truffle oil would've been good. But nice and comforting, anyhow :)Our server was very observant (noticed bf's medicine sitting on the table and asked if he was feeling better - I was quite impressed) and friendly, props to him! Encouraged us to come back for dinner (apparently they have a somewhat different menu for dinner vs. brunch).",

They aren't fan-f-tasting but it's those great thick potato chips great for sharing. We had a few dishes to share. Onion rings with curry mayo; otak; mushroom soup and homemade foccacia. The bread was utterly disappointing, a thin slice for sharing when we thought it came with the soup. Onion rings were a winner! Burger came fast and it took us only a few minutes to stuff our bellies. The char siew was a little too sweet for our liking. Friend describe it as eating a chocolate cake but in a meat form. Nevertheless, if you like char siew & bbq sauce, go for it. Ramlee burger was decent. With that I can only say that I'm a snob, because we are used to messy processed patty with all the silly sauces and kraft blue tub. Still, I really enjoyed the dish. Love the thai radish/cucumber salad. It was really refreshing and flavourful. Dessert was, well, bad. Sorry but I can't stand a dry cake, even after you slap it with a scoop of ice cream. Service was brilliant. Two guys running the front on a weekday, brilliant job! It's a great spot to chill out with friends and family but casual dining.",

    "text": "Enter Relish, a 3-year-old burger joint opened by Wild Rocket. Unlike the uppity image the parent restaurant may conjure, Relish positions itself as the \"fun family homeboy\" offspring of the F&B group.For mains, T had the Wild Rocket Burger ($14.50++ for 150g) which was served quite simply with arugala, Sarawak pepper cream, and sundried tomato relish, coupled with a side of chips. I can't help feeling that truffle fries, the smell of which was wafting from the next table, would've been a nicer touch to the plate.E, on the other hand, was tempted into Spaghetti Arrabiata ($17.50++). In her words, it was \"really good!\" which in any case, was good enough for me knowing that food is genuinely being enjoyed.I was feeling under the weather so I had to tear myself away from the meat and battered food. I picked the Butterfish in Cilantro Pesto Sauce ($26.00++). I had ordered the most lackluster (and not to mention, the most expensive) dish at the table for the night. To give credits, the fish was nicely grilled but it was rather tough - I couldn't decide if butterfish were meant to be so and it was just my Asian tastebuds being used to smooth silky fish meat. Nevertheless, the dish did not quite make its worth.A great place to head down to wind down with close friends and family. I'll say stick to the burgers.",

That said, the sweet potato fries were awesome, the beers (Taiwanese Lychee beer) were delicious, and the burgers satisfactory, so in terms of quality one can't really complain. It was the beers really, that pushed the bill into the 100+ mark.I love the blue cheese and pear burger here, and the only reason I didn't have that was because Marcus mentioned that the Ramly is new on the menu, and hey, I love Ramly burgers. Having tried it though, the one at the Burger Shack down the road is better. I'm not sure if the Burger Shack is still there actually. :/I've also tried their steak (pretty average), the mushroom soup (really quite tasty), and nibbled on the... dried prawn pasta from a friend. All said and done, the food here is reliable, the service usually very good, and the selection of beers is a definite pull. It's a little bit pricey, all said and done, but...They don't serve that Taiwanese Lychee beer just anywhere, and together with the blue cheese and pear burger? Mmm that's worth going back time and again.",

I went there on a quiet Saturday late afternoon and there were only 2 or 3 other tables occupied, but service was slow and in attentive. The staff were more interested in talking amongst themselves. Also when I'd asked about all day breakfast, the waiter rather condescendingly said, \"But you're too late. Until 4 only.\" Really, I was very unimpressed by his attitude and felt rather offended. I can think of at least 10 different ways be could have said that nicely, with a smile.I ordered the burger with blue cheese and poached pear and it was stunning.

Offering quality meat and fresh condiments, Relish's gourmet burgers pack an explosion of flavors with every bite! Try the Ramly Burger for a truly authentic asian burger experience. Instead of the usual condiment stacking in a regular burger, all toppings including the beef patty are wrapped in a thin layered omelet, hence creating a packet of intense flavors. If you're in the mood for a western adventure, go on and give the Poached Pear and Blue Cheese Burger a shot. If you need more toppings to satisfy your taste buds, add-ons are available for small fee. Wild Rocket also serves the occasional Asian inspired pasta which might prove a little spicy for some so be sure to check with your server. And finally, my personal favorite on the menu, the Relish Deconstructed Strawberry Cheesecake. The textured layers of cookie crumble, cream cheese and fresh strawberries ensure a sweet but light ending to the hearty meal.",
