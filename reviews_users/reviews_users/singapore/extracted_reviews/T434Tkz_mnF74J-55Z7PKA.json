The banana bread was a little disappointing though. We ordered earl grey tea, mojito and sangria (2 drinks for $15 promotion) and spent a good 3 hours there chilling. The restaurant wasnt too crowded and had a lovely atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit!",

You also get a soup, dessert and coffee/tea.I had the onion soup, a clear, peppery broth chock full of onion and infused with spices such as star anise. Didn't go wrong with tenderloin (slightly thin) with chestnut sauce (yes marron sauce), well-charred and done as ordered. It was vanilla ice cream topped with fruit cocktail for dessert, though I understand that changes.Service was also attentive but not intrusive, and they were cool about our toddler and also supplied a high chair.I'm not sure whether dinner portions are bigger or tastier, but for a lunch set, you simply can't ask for much more at this price point. Especially when these prices apply on Saturday AND Sunday!",

They were pretty rude to our company, and kept \"indirectly\"chasing us out well before closing time. Even though we made our order before their last order, they forgot one drink, and when we requested that they brought the mojito, they insisted that they couldn't make the mojito and offered us a shot because \"their liquor license ended at 11\" (it was 1040 at that point) and couldn't serve us alcohol... Not too sure about the logic behind that because a shot is still alcohol.",

    "text": "About Foster's, I only have this to say, that it's been around a long time and they have to be given credit for doing the same thing without fiddling with the standard document too much. \u00a0The restaurant has been Foster's since 1960, but it of course has not been run continuously by the same ownership over that period of time. \u00a0The current owners have run fosters for the last 13 years or so and have done a creditable job of keeping standards buoyant in this Holland Village institution, especially one of Fosters' pedigree.Looking over the newspaper styled menu, I notice that there are options, quite a lot of them actually besides grilled steer, which always leads me to be suspicious of a place that calls itself a steakhouse. \u00a0Of course there are many examples of steakhouse menus that are as varied and abundant as a Bali \u00a0market bazaar is with knick knacks and still respect their primary business model enough to churn out respectably grilled meat. \u00a0I'm just saying that I worry, maybe excessively, when I sit down at an establishment that claims to do steaks and look at the menu and see not a short list of bar food, seafood options and a kids menu, that the beef may not be getting the attention that it deserves. \u00a0The worm of doubt starts squirming, making me wonder if maybe the steaks aren't going to be that good given the vast inventory of perishables that must be stocked to keep this menu afloat and of course, what the turn over on product, especially the steaks at such a joint would be. \u00a0I'm just saying that I worry...maybe excessively...maybe needlessly.If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that ambience really isn't an issue for me. \u00a0I'll squat in some dung hole if there's a spiritual experience in a bowl in the offing. \u00a0I'm just saying that it would've been nice for for the fans to have been turned on and maybe more regular visits by the pest-fogging folks. \u00a0None of this really would've registered had the steaks been able to distract me enough.One last caveat before we talk meat. \u00a0I've been coming here for some time but had not had the beef in a while, always finding myself here in the afternoon for a nice cream tea instead.Ok, a word or two about the steaks at Foster's now.The Wagyu ribeye with an advertised marbling of 8 is ostensibly US beef. \u00a0The steaks are cut too thin. \u00a0This has been done to keep the cost of a steak below nose-bleed level, no doubt, but it does beg the question if a Wagyu ribeye should be put on the menu at all, in the first place, if you have to cut it so thin to keep food costs down? \u00a0It is my considered opinion that to cut steak that thin is just disrespectful to the ingredient. \u00a0If we can't afford to eat properly cut Wagyu steaks, we should just not breed and kill Wagyu cattle. \u00a0The thin cut resulted in a steak that was barely rare and what little flavor harbored in the marbling of that thin cut was almost completely smothered by the saut\u00e9ed onions it was resting on. \u00a0You cut meat that thin and rest it on saut\u00e9ed onions, it could be kangaroo or emu and still passably to the casual eye and palate, be beef. \u00a0 I still enjoyed the steak, but I think nostalgia had more than a little to do with it. \u00a0 I would caution someone with no history with Foster's against ordering the Wagyu Ribeye.The USDA Ribeye was similarly thinly cut and smothered in the same saut\u00e9ed onions, too far gone to be able to show off just how good (or bad) this beef actually was. \u00a0One other thing is that when you cut steaks that thin, the gristle starts to show its not so pleasant face more prominently than it should throughout the gastronomic performance of a steak dinner. \u00a0Not outright unpleasant, but a little jarring. I suppose if you're comparing this to what passes for steak at hawker center western food in Singapore, then this is pretty good; but not three times as good because this is what the ribeye costs at Foster's. \u00a0Again, I question the valuation of the product and where Foster's is pitching it's standard for steak cookery, what it's target audience might be. \u00a0Again, my experience here was saved by rose-tinted nostalgia.Nostalgia it seems can be the basis for a viable business model, especially when your custom is food and beverage. \u00a0While I cannot abide tweaking established culinary traditions, I would advise the current ownership to rethink how it's doing beef and steaks in particular. \u00a0Singaporeans now have been exposed to the intoxicatingly decadent flavors in a 6-8 oz tataki of prime Wagyu, they know that the very best ingredient, prepared with care and an in-depth knowledge of the ingredient, can be wonderful even in small quantities, that it's not always the biggest, bulkiest cut that'll be good. \u00a0Maybe now would be a good time to think about ratcheting up the quality of the beef and doing away with the presentation and the needless extras that don't make for an exceptional steak experience.",

    "text": "Tucked in a corner at Holland V, this little cafe that serves English classics like steaks, ribs and pasta. I'm really not sure if the rest of the food is good because i only go there for their scones. My only comment on the other dishes is that they smell really good, especially that lobster bisque. Yums..On a good day, the outdoor seating is not too bad. I reckon it would be nicer in the cooler evenings for a gathering with friends. I like that it is very casual and cosy. Fosters serves the cheapest high tea in Singapore. This is not the usual three-tiered high tea many hotels offer. What do you expect for a mere $10.90++? Here is Foster's explanation of the difference between afternoon tea and high tea. And this is what you get in the set- 2 scones, a toasted fruit cake (i love toasted goods. All things taste better toasted ie banana cakes. Swear by it!), 2 savory sandwiches and either tea/coffee. Sounds like a lot right? Well it is! I usually am satisfied after 1.5 scones but that's me. The rest of the stuff are just mediocre. If you don't want the rest, you can get the scones on their own. It's $2 or is it $2.50 for 1 but the minimum order is 3. Perfect for sharing. Extremely crunchy on the outside (i eat stuff for the texture, not just the taste alone. Other times purely for the texture. I'm weird that way.). Anyways, it's almost like a rock cake or a muffin top. Crunchy outside, buttery moist inside. Plus it's small, so the crunchy to moist ratio is just right. I love lacquering it with butter and the ones they provide are salted! Yay! So the butter goes on first, then a little of the whipped (no clotted cream here. What do you expect for this price right?). The whipped cream adds a tinge of sweetness which complements the butter. For those with a sweet tooth, have more of the jam. I'm no jam fan. They do a takeaway service as well and we have packed these for picnics previously. Everything comes packed nicely with all the complements and cutlery too. Our friends have nothing but positive feedback for the scones. Make a reservation especially for the weekends because they tend to be packed for tea.",

The cakes are also very light and flavorful - we have sampled the carrot cake and fruit cake so far and both get top marks.The service staff is friendly and helpful, making our visits enjoyable every time.Haven't tried much of their main courses other than the chicken pot pie, which was decent. The fries are excellent, and go well with the all day Happy hour, which has decent prices and options by Singapore standards.Update:Recently came here for lunch. The lunch special is great value (ordered the steak - just the right size, preceded by an excellent mushroom soup). Special also includes a nice coconut ice cream and coffee/tea. The BH ordered the Chicken a la Kiev, fried and infused with garlic herb butter, which was excellent. The next generation dug into the equally tasty fried chicken and fries. A very nice afternoon, I must say, especially when paired with the happy hour drink special.",

The Devonshire Cream Tea Set comprises of two scones served with butter, strawberry jam, luscious fresh cream, finger sandwiches and a choice of coffee or tea. Priced at $11, it is one of the cheaper tea sets available in Singapore. Do not come for tea though expecting to be full. Portions are tiny, but I suppose that is what you get for paying just $11. Atmosphere wise, the restaurant feels a bit contrived - at night, tiki torches are lit up outside as a way of inviting customers to dine there. But I suppose the reason why Fosters has remained open for so long is because it provides a quiet respite from the crowds in ever busy Holland Village.",
