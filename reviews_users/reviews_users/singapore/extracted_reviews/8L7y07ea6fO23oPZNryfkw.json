    "text": "I thought I would find Botan Shrimp on the menu but I didn't. Hah...but this Japanese restaurant serves up pretty delicious dishes that taste very close to those you find in Japanese homes. On the dinner menu, you'll find a list of Dinner Sets, ala carte sashimi, Yakitori, porridge, soba, sushi, tofu, tempura, etc.  The Gyunikyu Jagaimo is a flavourful simple beef stew with the caramelized sweetness of onions and carrots. Soft, creamy yet not spammed with too much mayonnaise. The Tamago yaki takes semblance after dashi-maki, served warm and significantly less sweeter. I felt short-changed on the Stir-fry Beef with Leeks as the greens were in shortage and the dish was too oily. And I'm sure most Japanese housewives would raise opposition towards this. Though being cruelly severed into slices, the Unagi Kabayaki ($15) remained a crowd pleaser with its fatty tissues that gave a full, tantalizing mouthfeel. If you love potato salad, then you should try the version here at $8 as it is probably the best I've come accords in Singapore. Not to forget the light low-calorie supper food Tofu Mentaiko; anything hardly goes wrong if you throw in some mentaiko and this is no exception :)",

The set came with the pork itself, a bowl of rice, chawanmushi, a medium slice of grilled chicken and some watermelon. The pork was nice although I have had more flavorful one. But this one is definitely way above average.Overall, I am definitely very satisfied with the quality of the food and the service here, and would definitely return here again for some awesome Japanese food!",

    "text": "We used to come here for celebratory team lunches. I still haven't figured out why the ladies' bento sets were larger than most other sets. But hey, something for everyone at lunch time. A la carte is definitely the way to go at dinner though--I really like the housemade tofu, and the clear soup with grilled mochi. There are also various deep-fried, stir-fried, soup-based whatevers to tickle your fancy, but what you really should do is to smile at the lady-boss (who is married to the Japanese chef) what's in season. Or to translate the lines in the menu that have no English equivalent, because that's how you hear of the existence of whale bacon and horse sashimi...or you could just eat yakisoba like the Japanese businessmen do...",

Sometimes the troops trundle over after a round of drinks after work for dinner.Food: Well, the bento boxes are good value and the sashimi's pretty decent. As are the tempura and sushi etc.Ambience: Quite a noisy lunch crowd, go early to avoid waiting.Service: Prompt and efficient.",

Also a big fan of the umaki tamago (unagi in egg roll).It's crowded during lunchtime because of the Raffles Place crowd, but quiet during dinner.",
