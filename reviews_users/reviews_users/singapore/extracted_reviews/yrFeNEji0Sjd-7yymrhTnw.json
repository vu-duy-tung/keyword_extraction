Don't expect much English spoken or a glamorous venue - this is just good, honest local food.Think Singapore crab buns, pork belly buns, prawn dumpling (har gow), prawn paste chicken wings, carrot cake just to name a few of the dim-sum based brunch menu. Food is fast, hot & fresh and accepting credit cards is a bonus. For drinks try the lime juice (refreshing for the nations' tropical climate) and tri-colour milk tea.",

Yes, it was great that I get to eat Dim Sum at 5am when I was really craving for it, but to get all the way there, and being served with barely-considered-warm porridge, slightly below average dim sum, was seriously a damper. Part of me wish that I have gone for mamak instead... But good thing - at least it's open, 24 hours if you really need your dim sum fix. But ya, depends on how desperate you are ... Otherwise just wait a bit and there should be plenary open by 8am.... And my fav opens at 11am :)",

    "text": "Original-destination: UYE#2 @ Immigrants Bar, Joo ChiatRandom-pit-stop: Mongkok Dim SumStefan L. and I were making our way to the second UYE at Immigrant's Bar when hunger climbed into the control mechanisms within our brains and piloted us off the bus just two short stops after we got on from the Kallang MRT Station. I'm honest when I say that I have no bloody clue where I am BUT I trusted Stefan both as a friend and guide as well as his opinion on Singaporean delicacies. So I tagged on quietly, albeit excitedly...for what we will be having at this pit-stop.As we zipped through several streets on foot (thankfully without bumping into random sleazebags that this area is apparently known for), he just mentioned that this \"beef hor fun\" was to die for and their dim-sum was like no other in Singapore. I wanted to troll him right that moment but decided to pass up on the \"oh, you would totally die for some beef *whore* fun huh?\" (Glad I bit my lip...cause we passed by a couple of such late night creatures on the way there).Right...so we arrived and noted that other reviews had been of the \"beef kway teow\" spot right across the street. Apparently, a little history lesson from Stefan, the uncle who owns Mongkok fell out with his nephew who then established that spot and both pointing fingers at each other that each had stolen each others' recipe.Honestly, I don't give two twats about that rivalry. Whoever makes the better dish wins. Since Stefan said that this place has the better \"hor fun\"...well, that nephew can go eat some balls.Our dish came out shortly after we placed our order.Beef Hor Fun:1 - there is a lot of beef...TENDER BEEF (reminds me of the \"Mongolian Beef\" dishes in US Chinese Restaurants; meat beaten the crap out off until tender)2 - the ratio of beef to noodles was...practically 1 to 1...which is freaking AWESOME3 - I didn't know it was SPICY (well for me it is)...and for all of you who don't know, my body has never recovered from my chili eating contest eons ago...so I had to really, really, REALLY take my time eating it4 - WINDim Sum:1. nothing spectacular tbh, but I'd eat it again any given day.2. so if this is the \"best\" in Singapore, dang...we have a problem.",

    "text": "This is one of those, \"Thanks Yelp for helping me find this!\" kind of place.I agree with my husband's initial assessment, which is \"This place is dim sum without all the frills.\" It's a corner shop, not air conditioned, no ambiance... strictly food. When we arrived around 11 AM, it was almost packed! Taking this as a good sign, we were seated right away and given a one page, double sided menu along with an order form. Now this is the part where you'll slap me in the face- I actually didn't order dim sum this time around because I was feeling under the weather (stomach-wise.) I only ordered chicken porridge while my husband ordered all of his favourite dishes.Although they don't focus on porridge, I was happy with the result even though it took a while for it to be served. It came with an egg yolk, which gave it more flavour in addition to the pepper. It was pure comfort food and hit the spot! Husband was happy with his dim sum. Overall, great spot for morning dim sum; wouldn't hesitate to come back when my stomach decides to cooperate! Also love how it's easily accessible by public transportation, as the closest bus stop caters to 11 bus lines.",

I am of Indian origin, and maybe my discernment for truly fantastic dim sum is a lot more skewed than the norm, but I find the dim sum here to be very satisfying. That being said, I am sure there are some other pretty amazing dim sum places across our city, I've just not been to them yet probably. \u00a0There are certain food items I tend to stay away from like glutinous rice and chicken feet, or stew of any kind, but I love the other dim sum on offer here. They boast an amazing variety that is impressive for a local hawker-styled establishment in Geylang. Whilst I am sure this is not the only dim sum place in that vicinity, it's the only one there that I've been to and unless I am introduced to another, I will keep going back.Their regular items like har gao, siew mai, chee cheong fun with minced pork, yam puff, fried prawn dumpling, prawn paste chicken, fried beancurd skin with shrimp, char siew baos, amongst a few others, are all really well prepared in my opinion. The \u00a0food here is value for money, we spent about $15-20 excluding drinks per person here with a tonne of food to share between us, and the real draw of this little dim sum joint is that it is open 24 hours a day. That's right, 3am dim sum cravings here we come!Give it a try, its no Michelin restaurant, but it definitely does the job for me!",
