Enjoyable place with tasty drinks and good snacks. I had more than enough alcohol from sharing a jug of sunrise magaritas ($42.90). Nachos with guacamole were thoughtfully covered with cheese - very neat and unlike the typical Mexican pile of cheese and sauces. The guacamole needs more work and salt, but tased ok with sour cream and tomatoes. Cheese curds was not melted enough for me. Also batter was quite salty. Service can definitely be improved. Will be back with the right crowd. #latergram #chilissg #drinks #drklingeats",

The place had quite a few diners too, and so definitely a popular outlet. Overall, quick service and good food. A good place to grab a quick bite for lunch",

I ordered from their lunch specials, and chose a Caesar salad and double cheese burger. The salad was fine, but the cheeseburger, though cheesy, had dry patties. The fries were also not fresh, as they were more chewy than crisp. For $18.75, you're better off just going to Burger King or McDonald's for something that costs a quarter of the price and would probably taste better. The only good thing about the lunch specials is that the soda refills are free; none of that $1-extra-to-top-up funny business.However, their baby back ribs and other Tex-Mex dishes appear okay. But if you're in the Clarke Quay area, I'd rather you visit some of the other restaurants in the upper levels of Central Mall for better chances of satisfying grub.",

Unfortunately, they have very few people staffed to run the large dining area. Thus, things can be a bit slow and you definitely have to grab someone to get any attention. Otherwise, the food is as good as any Chili's I've been to. The chips and salsa are always a good choice, as their tortillas are paper thin and crispy. The fajitas are one of the classic choices as well and may be enough for two to share unless you have a big appetite. If you know what to expect from a Chili's and want to have it, then you should not be disappointed by this location.",

With the completely unnecessary, but totally appropriate ranch doing sauce?Perhaps it's just remembering the good old days in college, hanging out at Chili's where my friends worked, milking the free refills and bottomless chips and occasional free dessert.Most likely it's the amalgamation of all of these things that makes Chili's a guilty sentimental pleasure. \u00a0One thing's for sure...

    "text": "Chili's is one of my favourite places for Tex-Mex cuisine. And ribs! Because we regularly hit up the original branch at Tanglin Mall, comparisons between that and its sister outlet at The Central were inevitably drawn when we dined there last weekend.Service differs, the Tanglin Mall one being better staffed, with more efficient service, whereas the staff at Clarke Quay were a little more frazzled and bumbling. Food, too, was a little lackluster at Clarke Quay compared to the commendable grub at Tanglin Mall. Clearly, the standards between the branches are inconsistent; I'll probably stick to the Tanglin Mall branch.We had:1) Beef Chili ($12.50): This was a little charred compared to the ones at Tanglin Mall, like someone left it on the burner a tad too long. Still a decent starter nonetheless.2) Chicken Enchilada Soup ($9.90): subtly spiced, and really lovely, if a bit stingy on the chicken chunks.3) Bacon Ranch Quesadillas ($24.90): these were a little anaemic, and significantly less generous with the fillings than at Tanglin Mall.4) Mango Chile Chicken ($19.90): wholesome, healthy, and delicious. The chicken was very nicely done, moist, flavourful and tender.5) Grilled Chicken Fajitas ($27.90): one of the highlights. Succulent chicken, thoroughly marinated, and imbued with an aromatic smoky accent.6) Classic BBQ Baby Back Ribs ($40.90 for full rack): outstanding as usual, hearty, flavoursome to the bone, fantastically burnished, with meat that was so tender it was practically fall-off-the-bone. This was served with excellent homestyle fries and a disappointingly dry skillet macaroni & cheese",

And while dinner here is a perfectly average affair of typical choices at typical prices, I do appreciate Chili's as somewhere near my clients that I can grab a quick lunch.For between $16-18 dollars you can get a half portion of soup, and a half portion of salad, or a sandwich, including a free flow drink. That's... decent. It's a nice change of pace when you're sick of eating the same thing from the area around the office everryyyyday. I can confidently say I'll go back, once in a while. It's nowhere I'd 'recommend to a friend', or visit because it's a special occasion, but in a way it's a like McDonald's for grown-ups. Simple, stable, kinda fast food that doesn't make for any surprises.We all need something familiar every once in a while!",

This Chili's is really nice, it's very bright and open with a wall of glass, feels much newer than the Tanglin location. The food is standard Chili's food, if you don't know, this is casual American food with a tex-mex twist, but still a full varied menu of choices. I have always enjoyed Chili's food since I worked in one over fifteen years ago. The menu has changed a lot over the years and some favorites have left (I will always miss you Smoked Turkey Sandwich) but many new items have been added to round out the selection. My favorite feature of Singapore Chili's is the unlimited drink refills, that really takes me home to the US.I was very pleased to see the Weekday lunch break promotion starting at $12.90 you get a starter, a main and a free flow drink. While the portions are a bit smaller, a few less fries, smaller main salad, at SGD12.90 this is a fantastic deal.The food took a bit long to come out for a lunch promotion in a fairly empty restaurant, but overall very good experience.",

First of all, the prices are way way way jacked up (also because it's in Clarke Quay). We had a table of 10 and got seated outside so the waiters never got to us. I got guac, salsa and chips but it just didn't taste right. I love Chili's in America, and it has quite decent food but this Chili's definitely does not live up to that standard. Since we were seated outside, they didn't really pay attention to us. It was really hard to get their attention, had to go inside to tell them. The worst thing that happened during dinner was that our friend got her meal when we were all done. When we all got our food, we asked them and they kept telling us 10mins. 10mins later, another 15mins. It was ridiculous. At the end, the manager came out to tell us that they actually forgot her order and it will come out in 10mins. By that time, our friend was so hungry, she wasn't even hungry anymore. In the end, they gave us that meal for free but it just wasn't worth the hassle.",
