For two people we ordered:Butter ChickenRogan JoshPalak PaneerJirra RiceGarlic Naan (x2)I immediately ordered a second garlic naan as soon as we received it cause there were only 3 steaming pieces. I knew I was going to eat 2 but I also knew my date at the Night Safari would've been a disaster with such a savage move. I ended up eating 4 pieces total and it was totally worth it. Food was great and the service was awesome. Will be back in the future!",

    "text": "New kid on the block serving North Indian cuisine nestled between a couple of coffeeshops in the middle of nowhere in Sembawang.I was told the chefs used to work at high-end places such as Raffles Hotel. Explains why the food quality is close to that served at the other pricier places around town. I enjoyed the butter chicken, fish tikka and the Rogan Josh (lamb curry). One thing to note is that the interpretations of the dishes are skewed a little towards western palates, with the spice level on the lower end of the scale and more tomato in the lamb curry. (As you know, Chicken Tikka Masala hails from the UK, not the sub-continent)I rounded out the evening with a mango kulfi (ice cream), though I wished more dessert choices were available (It was either this or the gulab jamun). This is more of a casual dining eatery, I saw a couple of families celebrating birthdays here. Prices are reasonable and don't cost you an arm and a leg. Now, if only if was not so out of the way, I'd not hesitate to make my way back here.",

    "text": "A Wonderful family-run Indian Restaurant located in Sembawang rd, of all places. My wife and I and fellow Yelper, Ricky, and his wife came here after spending an hour or so at the River Safari. We were looking for a place to eat while we waited for the Night Safari to open.Yes, food options at the zoo are quite limited, so why not take a quick can ride/uber to the nearest food centre? Do it!The food at Sher is fantastic. Everything from the butter chicken to the aloo gobi to the butter and garlic naan to the palak paneer was top notch. Pretty generic words, I know... However, I'd consider Cher to be my 2nd favorite Indian restaurant in SG. The owner is a pretty cool chap as well. If you have trouble choosing dishes, feel free to ask him his recommendation. You can't miss him.",

Yet again we just left it the owner to bring us something to eat with the caveat it had to include the fish tikka! \u00a0Mushroom Kukuri and a Melai kebab followed and all were up to the standard set with fish tikka. Our San Miguel's were followed by a great Margarita. Place looked to be busy with a nice mix of locals and expats.",

Very laid back place, friendly service, fresh ingredients, skilfully blended spices. Kids had already eaten before we went out but the the guys made some small Naans for them to munch on as a treat. Nice touch. Hope more people find out about this restaurant, they deserve to be successful.",

So being the adventurous type - I gave it a try. The atmosphere is laid back and they treated this American like 1 of their own...you won't be disappointed.",
