With marinated salmon, bream and tuna nice portion sizes although the wait staff dropped the remaining sauce into our niece's pocketbook with out realizing it. The waitress refilled our water glasses by serving across our plates instead of moving to the right of each guest. Our coffee was dishwasher quality and the espresso was lacking true flavor. When we didn't order dessert the waitress took a LONG time to present our check. The famous chef that owns this place should re-train the entire wait staff.",

A bit too much as a main size, I would recommend the entree size if having a starter, especially because the bread and butter are so delicious. Good service, great bar staff, nice ambience",

Ultimately she's giving excuses vs offering solutions and came off non-responsive so we had to take initiative to make sure we get our seats. As though walking in without a reservation is unwelcomed. The host came off uppity but our waiter was efficient and friendly.Other negative was \"no more\" Beef Wellington. Wtfbbq! :\\Food was just ok to great.Scallops- Great. Well cooked. Wish there was more than 3 though.Shepherds Pie- Deceivingly small. Lamb pieces were chunky but tender. Pretty ok dish.Black Cod- Simply delicious.Fish Cake- Skip. Picture looked tastier than it is. Much too dry.Beef Burger- Burger was normal. Nothing amazing. What's amazing is the ketchup for the fries. Surprisingly good.Overall make a reservation if you're a GR fan or curious, because if you had to wait, skip this place. Better joints around.",

    "text": "It pains me to give Bread Street Kitchen even one star - it deserves none. We went in on a Saturday morning, expecting to have a wonderful brunch. We left feeling grossly full and severely unsatisfied. First the bread basket. Perhaps stale is too strong a word, but most of the bread was exactly that. Dry, tasteless and hard. The butter was overly salted. I adjusted my expectations and hoped for a less disappointing rest of the meal. We all ordered the Eggs Benedict to play it safe - there's no way they'd get this wrong. Eggs: overly poached. Rubbery consistency. Ham: so so so salty. I needed a few glasses of water to wash this down. Hollandaise: Thick. Extremely salty. And thick.I felt like I was eating a tub of butter with old bread and a sad egg substitute. I didn't have it in me to order anything else- I wanted to leave as soon as I could. But the slow and pathetic service at the restaurant, didn't even allow for that. Perhaps filming a few episodes of 'Kitchen Nightmares' right here at BSK, will help Gordon Ramsay turn his restaurant around.",

Ordered a main course for myself, with an appetiser and a dessert to share for two. Conducted an extensive due dilligence to pick out the best dish to order before the visit.Appetiser: Roasted veal carpaccioThis was heavenly. Everything was well-seasoned and tender. Prior reviews got this one spot on; this was a gem.Main Course: Fish and Chips + BSK Short Rib burger (my friend's)My fish and chips was meh. The fish was of a great quality, but it was very under-seasoned. Mediocre. However, my friend remarked his burger as delicious, tender and juicy.Dessert: Monkey Shoulder CheesecakeMediocre. Ended the night with a flat note.Although my visit was alright, consistency seems to be an issue here. For example, my friend visited this restaurant again a few months after, and his friend's rib burger tasted like rubber. Many reviews online have been scathing as well regarding its food quality, and whether it is value for money. Worth a visit once, but you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere afterwards.",

Food is OK at best.Unfortunately I've never been a fan of Gordon Ramsey restaurants. From NYC to London to Las Vegas, his formal dining spots never served any dishes that I would tout at memorable. For the most part, this one isn't much different.Gotta admit, I love the vibe and most everything surrounding this place, especially how casual it is for a bustling Marina Bay Sands restaurant. The food is just nothing special. Went for the recommended fish and chips which I hoped would be crispy batter with tasty fish inside. Rather it was a soggy batter that tasted like any other fish and chips I've ever had except this felt much more full of oil. Tartare sauce and fries were nothing special. Not to mention we waited a very long time for this to come out.We also went for the tuna tartare which had a fishy taste to it surprisingly. I couldn't finish.Went on another occasion where I sat at the bar and had their whiskey sour with homemade almost syrup (can't remember the exact name) and was floored by how amazing it was. I requested the mac and cheese as well and it wasn't good at all. I will be back in the future for drinks and the bar vibe but wouldn't recommend for a special lunch or dinner.",

Maybe the cook is a closet arsonist. Loved the salmon ceviche as it's well balanced. The service is attentive and spot on(food served at the same time, refilling drinks, etc). Even the bread is nice as it's made in house. I think this place you'll need a reservation unless you come at an odd hour.",

The coffee was the most expensive I've ever had & thankfully it was a great tasting coffee, up there with Melbourne coffee standards BUT when the coffee costs almost half the price of your main then that is a bit of a worry. I had the smoked salmon & scrambled eggs for main ($17) which was lovely except that my smoked salmon had a few bones in it and the toast came out with no butter. The staff are really lovely, attentive and professional. Overall the food is tasty, the service is really good and I would probably dine here again but I would ask that the price of the coffee is reviewed.",

Alas, I also know that celebrity chef restaurants mean celebrity chef prices and that's what has dampened my enthusiasm somewhat. Still Bread Street Kitchen was decent, if not mind-blowing.We arrived at 1130am for brunch and were seated almost immediately, the restaurant was relatively full for pre-lunch hour and many people were celebrating birthdays. I guess it is a pretty nice place for a celebration.We shared the scallops as a starter - they were good though unremarkable and unfortunately very salty.For my main, I ordered the corn fritters. They arrived and looked quite beautiful except that they were definitely not fritters and more like pancakes. Still delicious with the sour cream, guac and sauteed peppers but I was a little disappointed because I was looking forward to some crisp fritters for lunch. I'd have been happier if they just changed the name to manage expectations.Someone at my table ordered the signature fish and chips - it was pretty well done and was a huge piece of fish! It was nicely fried, well battered and very fresh. I liked their little jars of ketchup and tartar sauce too.The highlight of the meal however, was the free jar of cookies that came with the check! Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies - fresh and crisp and not too sweet. I had to close the jar to stop myself from finishing them all.",

I have bookmarked Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen since last year but never get a chance to try it.Guess today was the day when I should go check it out. I had been to a Gordon Ramsay's Michelin-starred restaurant decade ago. It was a great memorable dining experience for me. Bread Street Kitchen was located at L1 at The Shoppes at Marina May Sands. I read somewhere it was supposed to be a casual restaurant but I do not recommend wearing shorts and flip flops here. There was only one thing I wanted to try for my first visit to Bread Street Kitchen. That would be the Classic Fish & Chips. FOODClassic Fish & Chips with crushed peas & tartar sauce - 4/5 ~ The portion was generous. The type of fish used here was lingcod. I guess I like my fish to be of Atlantic Cod. Anyhow, the batter was perfect. Love the chips, they were thicker than the normal American fries. The crushed peas was nasty. \u00a0 Sorry, it looked like those pea pur\u00e9e for babies and I must say this must be one of those acquired taste kind of thing :PIced Lemon Tea - 5/5 ~ different in a very good way. Not too sweet and 100% refreshing!!AMBIENCE - 5/5I like the d\u00e9cor, music a tad loud for me. SERVICE -5/5Karen was very friendly and attentive. After the food was served, she came back and checked how I like the food. When I was done with the food (no, I couldn't finish all my food), she cleared the plate and cleaned up any crumbs on the table. Shortly after I asked for the check, she came back with an iPad and asked if I would be kind to give a survey of the dining experience today. How could I say no when someone asked so nicely? :D She also left a jar of chocolate chip cookies with a tong. I took one out to try, it was very good! Crisp and not too sugary sweet. I was planning to give an overall 4 star for my review but Karen was so outstanding (hard to get such service these days) and so I am happy to award a 5 stars to Bread Street Kitchen. I hope Gordon Ramsay will give her a raise or promotion, lol!",

    "text": "Sorry but I ate the pictures before taking them... Decided to try Gordon Ramsey's food and recipes to see how they turnout. Started with two appetizers, the tamarind spiced chicken wings and the tuna tartar with crispy wantons. First the wings. They were probably the worst wings I have ever encountered. It had a hard breaded shell with an overly sweet (no hint of the tamarind) sauce. The colder the wings got the tougher they became. Second the tuna tartar. The tuna was almost flavorless except for some sesame oil which is fairly mild. The crispy wonton skins made up for the dish.For the entree, my dining partner and I decided to try the roasted pork belly with an apple chutney/roulade. The pork had the skin left on and it was roasted into a hard crust. Furthermore the crust was quite heavily salted that it made it difficult to. It sat in a soy sauce based sauce which made it saltier and difficult to cut into even with a steak knife. The saving grace was the pork itself was cooked perfectly and was not too fatty as pork belly can tend to be. The apple chutney was excellent and went well with the pork meat.Service was very good and the servers were more than attentive. The bread bowl came out quickly and so did our waters. Even though the bottle of water sat onour table. The servers would refill our glasses periodically.The bottom line is that I am not sure if I will make an effort to visit here again.",

    "text": "More Than Just Comfort Food In This Kitchen. All I can say is...... Finally!!After months and months of debating if I should give Bread Street Kitchen a shot, we decided to make our way down to finally give it a try. I have to admit, I'm a huge.... HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsey's, so I was caught on the fence about the initial reviews. Having eaten at Gordon Ramsey at the London in Manhattan (now closed) and his flag ship restaurant Gordon Ramsey at Hospital Road, in London, the expectations were pretty high. Yes, it's a casual take on Gordon Ramsey and yes it's comfort food but..... It's still a Gordon Ramsey group of restaurants. So while a part of me said YES I have to eat here, the other half told me \"but what if it's a let down like initial reviews suggested?\".Initial Service. Was a little disappointed. Considering how you get immediate attention and service and his other restaurant, this one was a little slower. No hostess at the reception counter, wait staff and managers glancing over with no one really saying anything u till the hostess arrived a minute or so later. However, hostess was polite enough to explain that the restaurant was fully reserved and that we had to return our table in an hour. No harm darn considering a) this wasn't a fine dining 3 hour long lunch experience b) we had to get back to the museum for some workshops anyway.The Menu Nothing overly elaborate. 3 page menu filled with comfort food ranging from a Brunch items like Eggs Benedict to Salads, hot mains and Grilled items like Roasted Chicken and Angus steaks. The Price I have to admit, a little of the steep side. Having lunched at his other 2 restaurants, which offered 3 course lunch specials for \u00a335 and USD45, a S$38 Shepherd's pie is a bit pricey. However, considering that this IS Marina Bay Sands where you pay $10 for chicken rice and $27 for a Margherita pizza. We decided to go with the basics. After all, isn't the simplest food the hardest to prepare?Bread Basket The break selection is fantastic! And the butter? To die for! My only wish was that the bread was a little warmer but the variety given was fantastic and tasted great. Couldn't have asked for more. Scallops Off the bat, perfectly cooked scallops. Having had below par scallops recently, this certainly helped the Gf put into perspective what beautifully cooked scallops should taste like. The carrot pur\u00e9e though, I thought, was a little light. While smooth and still a bit sweet, it didn't quite shine like a carrot pur\u00e9e should, with the pur\u00e9e offering more texture than it does flavour. The apple and bacon combination was delightful though, offering enough saltiness, with the richness cut by the apples. However, while the sweetness of the scallops was this there, eating it without the pur\u00e9e and apples made it a bit on the salty side. Overall, still a good dish and nothing is more comforting that the holy trinity of Scallop, Bacon and Apples. Fish & Chips Now THIS is what I call fish and chips. Unfortunately, a lot of the fish and chips in Singapore, though claiming to be authentic British fish and chips, some how still feels a bit of a let down.From the first cut, you would know that this is a good Fish and Chips. The batter was thin and crispy and a first cut in reveals a very juicy, perfectly cooked piece of cod. Juicy, succulent. Although not as large as Smith's, the difference in quality is undeniable. The fish was fresh, not frozen and it was beautifully seasoned. And the chips. The chips are so so so good! By far one of the best fish and chips I've had in Singapore. Millionaires Shortbread with Hazel-Nut milk Sorbet. Chocolate lovers rejoice! This is definitely an ultimate chocolate lover's delight! Rich and smooth chocolate on top with a brownie like base, this is what I call A DESSERT!The hazel-nut milk sorbet was more ice cream than sorbet and was rather sweet but it's creaminess did add to the smoothness of an already rich chocolate \"cake\". \u00a0 Overall impression. While the food was good, service was average. While staff were friendly, it did feel like they were a bit stretched, with the chef calling service please 3-4 times before dessert was picked up and the bill taking a fair bit to reach us. Will we be back? Definitely. If they could make fish and chips that good, I can't wait to try the rest of their dishes. However, because of the price, I can see why people are put off. Blame it on rental or the fact that he's a celebrity chef in MBS but the restaurant would have gotten a solid 5 had it not been for the slow service and price.",

    "text": "Ah, celebrity chefs. Love them, or hate them. We, in Singapore are always very fortunate to have world renowned chefs opening their establishments here giving us an opportunity to try their creation in our home soil rather than flying halfway across the globe. From Wolfgang Puck to Tetsuya Wakuda to Joel Robouchon - we have it all here. And just recently Gordon Ramsay, the no-nonsense chef we love watching on TV opened his first restaurant in MBS and got everyone excited. I called two days ago and was told the restaurant is fully booked everyday until July 28th. Two days ago was July 1st. Not giving up, my friend and I walked in at 6pm yesterday with \"puss-in-boots\" lost and hungry expression while pushing our luck with the hostess in charge. Turns out she has a table and the reservation is only by 730pm. She asked if we can finish by then and we happily said FOR SHUREEEE! We have the best table for the night, on the lower floor, quieter and right next to the open kitchen. Upon seated, we were presented with a basket of various home-made bread served with a slab of salted butter. We then proceed to order one item from each category - from cold starter, to hot starter to mains. First off - Alaskan king crab and apple cocktail with pink peppercorn. Delicious. Succulent and plump pieces of Alaskan king crab tossed with thin apple slices in light dressing. A refreshing start to a great meal. Next up, we have English green asparagus with parma ham, poached egg and hollandaise sauce. The parma ham could be more generous in my opinion since they charge $20 for 4 stalks of pathetic looking asparagus. Taste wise, it was pretty good with a combination of different textures from the asparagus, the smoothness of the poached egg and hollandaise sauce. For salad, we ordered warm bang bang chicken salad with watercress mouli, chili, beansprout, radish, ginger and peanuts. So good! Nothing beats a warm salad with pieces of chicken that pack a punch. The chili woke up the taste buds (and sweat glands too) and I did break a sweat or two while polishing the dish clean. All the mains sound good from the menu and we were torn between BSK short rib burger or the slow roasted pork belly, but alas, our host won us over by suggesting the traditional fish and chips with crushed peas and tartar sauce - a British classic and an all-time favorite. The fish and chips is decent and live up to expectations. Lightly battered while maintaining the freshness of the fish after deep frying. I wish they serve 2 pieces of fillet instead of one though. What impress me most is the mustard and ketchup in a jar so cute you want to steal it home (but please don't, stay classy!) from Wilkin & Sons Ltd. So very Bri-ish Stamford Raffles would be so proud. Overall, it was an enjoyable evening - food is great and service is commendable. Maybe it's still early and the restaurant wasn't that pack so we get all the attention. It was my first experience eating at Ramsay's restaurant and I came with no expectation. And usually when you have the least expectations, it will surpass and impress. Some of you might argue you have better experience from his restaurants elsewhere, but for me, the restaurant deserves a 3.72957 stars, round up to 4. Definitely coming back in the next couple of months and see how it matures. \u00a0p/s: 3 appetizers, 1 main, 1 glass of house red + 1 \u00a0beer = $136 without tax.",

    "text": "Came here on a Monday night as my friend and I were in the area. And since she talked about Chef Gordon Ramsay, I decided to bring her here to give it a try.While entering the open concept restaurant, we were greeted by a female staff and she asked us whether we had any reservation. As we did not have one, we were asked whether we mind bar seats. Without much hesitation, we said we do not mind. We were led to our high chair seatings (facing each other). I decided to sit facing the waters. Took a quick look at the menu and ordered the following.1) Fish & Chips - The beer battered fish fillet was great. It was slightly fried giving the top part a crispy touch to it. The thick cut fries was disappointing though as it has not much taste to it. I had to ask the waiter whether there is mashed potato gravy and he ended up getting me their special brown sauce (a few ingredients mixed and similar to bbq sauce but it had a tangy taste). The crushed peas was interesting and the tartar sauce was great if eaten with the fish fillet. Unfortunately this dish did not live up to my expectations especially after staying in Sydney for 4 months.2) Onion rings - 6 rings inside a bowl. The flour overpowered the taste of the onions. It was crunchy but would prefer to be served warmer. This appetizer is really filling and even without condiments, it is salty. 3) Pineapple Carpaccio, passionfruit and coconut sorbet - I ordered this as it has all my favorite tropical fruits in a dish. When the dish arrived, I was wow-ed by the looks. The grated coconut flakes and the thinly sliced pineapples were pretty attractive on a white serving plate. The coconut sorbet was also perfectly scooped. This dish did impressed me. The thinly sliced pineapple that looks like flower petals were sweet. And with the addition of scattered passionfruit with seeds it made the dish to be both sweet and sour. And the coconut flakes added the crunch to the dish. The coconut sorbet was not too sweet either. Definitely love this plate of dessert.4) Rhythm & Blues (mocktail/ non-alcoholic) - somehow the ingredients inside this beverage made me order this beverage. It came in a martini glass. The mocktail was fruity and refreshing. And there was a mint leaf on top of it too to add flavor to the drink. At the top of the beverage, there was a foamy layer and the bartender added salt and pepper. You could taste the interesting spun for this drink towards the end and yes, it was addictive. This drink has less ice too so it was not diluted.5) Forbidden forest (mocktail/ non-alcoholic) - this drink came in a tall glass with a small base. It came with a straw and you could see the crushed ice too. On top of the drink, there was a raspberry and a small touch of rosemary. Unfortunately this drink was a little diluted (too much ice) and you could probably finish it in countable sips. Before the dishes and the beverages arrive, we were given freshly baked homemade breads. The breads were alright but the butter that accompanied the bread was addictive. It melts inside the mouth and was not as salty as I had expected. Service here was pretty efficient. Once you raise your hand up in the air, a waiter or waitress will head to you quickly. I would prefer my dishes to be warmer and the price to be lower. Good experience dining in a restaurant opened by a celebrity chef.",

    "text": "Celebrity chefs. Its easy to sell the concept especially in a very brand conscious city like Singapore. Furthermore, it location - Marina Bay Sands - thrives on this concept. You name the luxury brand, we have it there. A fan of GR himself, I may prove to be a tad bias on this review. In addition, i must add that I went with my mom and her group of friends. So, in essence, my experience wasn't the most refined but relatable to the heartlander.At least the wait staff was patient enough to handle the aunty-ness in my mom and her friends. Allowing them to randomly call out items from the menu and turning a blind eye to the concept of them sharing everything they ordered. They were also proactive to offer suggestions on what to order based on the clientele of the table, which I appreciated.For starters, the corn soup was amazing. The texture and the protein was well done. Creamy and flavourful. A very good way to start the meal. Their asian flavoured wings (9 pieces in all) were well marinated and had a tang to it. My mom's friends call it the atas har cheong kai (upscale spiced chicken wing) and enjoyed relishing its taste with their fingers while I quietly attempt not to cringe.For the mains, they ordered the smoked salmon and the sunday special, Sunday Roast. While I had the rib eye which was not exactly done as per ordered - medium rare - but overall the flavour was there. The bernaise sauce that accompanied the steak was good. Overall, all the mains we ordered met expectations and the portions just right.As for dessert, i was floored with their chocolate cake with mint ice cream. My two favourite flavours in the entire world. It was as if this dessert was made just for me. The center was oozing with chocolatey goodness and the mint ice cream was just smooth and not too sweet. Oh and the aunties ordered a berry pie, which was okay. Tartness was there but compared to me cake... Let's just say it wasnt the best. Haha.I would come back here again to get a taste of their other dishes. Although i must admit with a table of 5 we covered about 25% of the items off the menu. The aunties love it and they will be back with more aunty-ness with their family and othee aunty friends. So I guess GR can't go very wrong with this joint. Maybe next time I'll come with a more sophisticated crowd to see how its like on the other side of the grass patch. Till then, enjoy BSK!",
