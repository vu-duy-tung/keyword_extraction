Buffet includes crab hot pot, sirloin steak, meat skewers, whole squid, maki, good sides and decent desserts. The value really cannot be beaten and the service was also excellent, even during the weekend rush when the kitchen was overloaded.$52pp on Fri/Sat. Slightly cheaper during the week.",

    "text": "My friend and I were hungry and looking for a place...pronto!walked upon this place in the Robertson Quay with all its specials and deals on a banner.Restaurant was clean and had a business-like restaurant appeal.Server gave us the lunch special menu and as we looked over the menu things seemed pretty expensive for what you got, but we were hungry....so it didn't matter. Once the server came over, I asked about their \"All you can eat Shabu deal\"....then he comes out with 3 other menus with all the other deals/specials...that were much better. WTF right???Long story short, we got the \"All you can eat shabu/japanese small dishes\" dealWe devoured:- A plate of pork and beef shabu- Tuna handroll- Chicken karage- Miso soup- Butter asparagus- Fried prawns- Thai beef salad- Pork cutlet- Chicken gizzard- green tea ice cream(Much much more on the menu too)All this was $42 per person. Sounds expensive? When you compare it with their other entrees and \"combos\"....you're only $10 away from getting all of this endlessly.Overall, service was friendly...but should've given us all the specials/deals menu in the get-go. Clean and and would recommend if you are really hungry.",

    "text": "This is a review of a Thursday evening dinner date at Z'en Japanese Cuisine.The room is a combination of Japanese aesthetic and modern classic design. \u00a0The space \u00a0includes several nice design elements but the ceiling is probably the accent that stands out the most. \u00a0tinyurl.com/bp85nj2While not full, the restaurant was busy. \u00a0There appears to be three sitting areas, outdoors, lower level indoors (our seating area), and upper level indoors.Z'en has an extensive menu and it took us quite awhile to determine what we were going to order.The service was relatively good. \u00a0For the most part, the staff was attentive. \u00a0 There were some gaps where they were not really checking in. \u00a0The staff was professional and polite but not extremely friendly. \u00a0The most significant negative was the pacing of the meal. \u00a0 We were two people sitting at a four top. \u00a0There should have been plenty of room for food. \u00a0However, almost all of the food arrived within the same short time period. \u00a0We ordered quite a bit of food. \u00a0It was overwhelming. \u00a0There wasn't enough space. \u00a0Plus, along with the other dishes, we were managing shabu shabu. \u00a0The staff was not overly proactive in quickly clearing the plates we had finished. \u00a0 There should have been some thought put into how the dishes were timed. \u00a0The food ranged from good to extremely good. \u00a0 The presentation for their dishes was quite appetizing.Sushi - We ordered a wide range of sashimi and nigiri. \u00a0It was all very good. \u00a0The seafood was fresh. \u00a0The sushi was well-prepared. \u00a0My favorite was the swordfish. The flavour was extremely delicate.Mekajiki (Swordfish) Sashimi tinyurl.com/cehd94oMaguro (Tuna) & Avocadotinyurl.com/cwleltsMixed Plate (we selected) - Ebi (Shrimp), Saba (Mackerel), Uni (Sea Urchin), Blue Fin (for her - I choose not to eat Blue Fin tuna)tinyurl.com/d7cl9t2Wafu Sakoro Beef - I really enjoyed this dish. \u00a0I can think of no better way to describe than a Japanese version of country friend steak with mashed potatoes. \u00a0There were nuggets of breaded steak placed on top of mashed potatoes. \u00a0The seasoning was amazing. \u00a0The meat was tender with the slight crunch of the breading. \u00a0I could eat this everyday.tinyurl.com/d2y6e6jTempura Mori - This was a mixed tempura. \u00a0It was actually very good. \u00a0I also enjoyed the sauce provided for this. \u00a0When served, the tempura was hot and crisp. \u00a0I particularly enjoyed the mushrooms.Unfortunately, it was served during the full flurry of dishes. It was pushed to a far corner of the table making it difficult for either of us to try it. \u00a0We did manage to work around and eat most of it. \u00a0But, with everything else, by the time we ate it, much of the tempura had cooled.tinyurl.com/cwaostmShabu Shabu - First, since this was brought overlapping everything else, it was very difficult to manage the cooking process. \u00a0It was quite good but because of timing we kept slightly overcooking the meat. \u00a0Their version of the standard shabu shabu dip was divine.tinyurl.com/cujb3tltinyurl.com/d94sgg7Salmon Kama (jawbone) - They were out of the hamachi kama. \u00a0We decided on the salmon. \u00a0This was my first time having salmon kama. \u00a0I must admit this was probably the one dish too far. \u00a0We had ordered a lot of food. \u00a0I did try it and it was extremely good. \u00a0The fish was so tender and flaky. \u00a0We did not come close to finishing this dish.tinyurl.com/cl2x95cAlong the way, I pretty much lost my bottle of sake. \u00a0While keeping up with all of the food, I just didn't have time to keep pouring. \u00a0I think I drank less than half of it.Receipt ($272.20)tinyurl.com/d6qhplhDuring this review, I have commented numerous times on the timing of the meal. \u00a0However, it was egregious. \u00a0This should have been an enjoyable relaxed dining experience where we could truly savor their very delicious food. \u00a0However, it was not. \u00a0It was a race to try the dishes and complete them while they were still at their peak.Overall - The food was very good. \u00a0With the exception of the pacing and some lapses in attentiveness, the service was good. \u00a0The room is quite comfortable with a warm and inviting feel and impressive modern design elements. \u00a0This could have been a four or five star experience. \u00a0In the end though, it fell short.",

    "text": "We all know that the Clarke Quay, River Valley and Robertson areas are big on Japanese food. But little did i know i've been missing out on the biggest in-plain-sight gem, Z'en Japanese Cuisine, for so long. I've walked past (and even through) this restaurant at UE Square too many times and i can't believe i never considered going in. Z'en (a sister outlet of En Japanese Dining Bar) is run by executive chef, Masashi Yasui from Kyoto. You'll be dizzy with choices just looking at the a la carte buffet menu (64 items in total) and there are a lot more in the main one. I would highly recommend the buffet for the quality items and reasonable price. Buffet prices are listed at the end of the post and it's cheaper to go on weekends (i don't know why but i'm not complaining). I was looking forward to lots of Shabu shabu after a recent authentic meal. Z'en serves both the beef and chicken shabu shabu. Needless to say, we went for the Australian Wagyu beef (200g for $39). The meat isn't sliced very thin and that took a while to cook on the portable stove but it was quite delicious with the ponzu sauce. Remember to ask for the peanut one too! We had at least 10 plates of this. Very nice and not too bad marbling.Other than shabu shabu, other items include some sushi and salmon sashimi. The pieces of sashimi are very small (1/4 the regular size). It's easier to order a few more sets at a go. I wasn't expecting very high quality sashimi anyway so it met my expectations. The Aburi salmon sushi was nice too with small amounts of rice and the salmon was nicely torched. We gave the rest of the sushi a miss to save our stomach space. Of course the rice and noodles section was left unordered. If you must, try the Zuwai Chahan with gravy (Crab Fried Rice, mui fan style, S$23).From the Grilled Dishes, you mustn't miss the Sirloin Steak with ponzu sauce (200g for S$32). This was perfectly grilled to a tender pink and when it was served, we simply ignored the shabu shabu. This is THE DISH to eat. The fried garlic at the side were irresistible and went well with the meat. For moo moo lovers, do order the Stir Fried Tenderloin Beef cubes with mashed potatoes as well (we forgot about it)The boys loved the Grilled Squid (S$13) and Baked Oysters as well. Not too rubbery, nicely grilled and rather fresh. There are some skewers and grilled fish on the menu but we gave that a miss.From the fried section, i adored the Cream Crab Croquette (4pcs for S$10), Ebi Tempura (3pcs for S$13) and Age Gyoza (5pcs for S$10). The Agedashi Tofu (S$10) wasn't too bad either as it cleanses the palette with its light broth.Desserts weren't that fantastic but i ate some anyway. You need a sweet end to every meal. Skip the chocolate and vanilla ice cream. The green tea one is a little too milky as well. The Tofu cheesecake and Creme Brulee were adequate in taste and texture. There were many dishes that we didn't try but we were very happy with most of the items which we had. The boys were quite happy with my restaurant choice, even the picky W. I will probably be back when my Shabu craving kicks in again. Service was a little slow and they have the tendency to forget your orders so place more in advance. Wastage is charged though so don't over-order!Now for the buffet prices: Weekday Lunch (S$38++)Weekday and Eve of PH Dinner: S$52++Weekend and PH Dinner: S$48++Make a reservation! It's very popular. Pictures and more reviews available on my blog. Check it out.",

While I come mainly for the shabu shabu steamboat, I recommended getting the baked oyster and soft shell crab maki as notable additions from the menu as they taste really good. Both service and the overall ambience is very good. Have been here many times and will continue to go as it is very good value for the beautiful and tender beef!",
