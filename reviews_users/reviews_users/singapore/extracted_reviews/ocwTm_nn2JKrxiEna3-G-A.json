    "text": "I like that this is nearer home plus it is air conditioned. The wait is still at least 20 minutes on a Sunday after 2pm. If you are dining in, you need to get a table first before placing your order. There is a machine which accepts cash for takeaway orders. So you place your order and the queue number is written at the top. Go to the pick up area and wait for your number to be flashed on the board. If there is more than 10 or 15 digit gap, go outside and walk around. The chicken is nice but I think the one at the original hawker stall in Chinatown food center is better. The white meat is not as tender here. Same for the char siew and sio bak. I like the noodle and the sauce though. For just under $5 a plate, this is better quality food and value than those served at generic food courts or coffee shops. I will still come here as it is near home and parking is easy. Once the underpass from Tai Seng MRT to the building is open, this will be even more accessible.",

    "text": "Came at around 2.45pm on a weekday. The working crowd has dissipated and its all alone for me and my chicken. First of all, I followed the guy before and ordered extra noodles for the soya sauce chicken. Boy was I shocked at the huge quantity of noodles and wondered if I were able to finish it. After the first bite.. the chewiness, the sauce, the chilli paste, the green chillies I added... oh so many emotions. I may be exaggerating slightly, but it ain't totally.The noodles were chewy, and not disappointing. It soaks up and pairs with the soya sauce pretty well. The sauce is a little sweet and very flavourful. Noodles paired well also with the refreshingly cold green chillies. Next surprise: the chillies they gave. It's not spicy as I thought it would; in fact it was very mild, but there is a ever-so-slight prawn paste taste to it. I love it! Soya sauce chicken was tasty and the chicken is not like fantabulous so keep your expectations around there. Although its one michelin star, its hawker food for the masses after all. Chicken's soft enough for me and I quite enjoyed it. I just wish there were lesser bones. Some people said that the one in Smith Street is better; I hope to try that out someday. For now, this brings soya sauce chicken to a consistently good level. \u00a0Seriously impressed!",

Avoid at all cost. Wait times could be 30mins, at least we waited that long for our order to be ready.So, we got our order, everything looks glistening. First note, it was oily. A lot of oil swirling around my noodle and our bean sprouts. My soy sauce chicken hor fun was good, but I didn't think it was better than others of the same. The chicken was smooth and tender, so are some that I've tasted elsewhere. The bean sprouts were crunchy but it was not any different from other stalls who also serve this. We also ordered a side of char siew & siew yok, I felt the siew yok was so tender that it had not texture. Could've been better if there was some bite.Overall, I don't think it was any better than other soy sauce chicken dish. I hold my praises for this.",

    "text": "\"Worth Waiting\"Read about Liao Fan in the New York Times months ago because he has the least expensive 1 star Michelin restaurant in the world.So we were in Chinatown and decided to try it. Encountering a line outside the restaurant, we only waited 10 to 15 more minutes until we were ushered inside to order. You can use the self ordering kiosk or order at the counter.Then you try to get a table. It is communal dining. You wait for your order number to appear so you can get your food.A limited menu basically featuring chicken and pork cooked in a soy sauce sauce. You can get it with either rice or noodles.We ordered one of each. Both were very good, moist and tendered.And the cost was unreal. The 2 dishes and a Tiger beer. were $ 15 Singapore dollars and around $ 9 US Dollars.",

Best tip is to divide and conquer especially if you have a big group. One person wait in line while others find and reserve a seat because that is how it works. Order the chicken and pork and you won't regret it. Use the tray they give you NO matter what you think you can handle. The sauce can spill easily so don't risk it. They do accept credit card and enjoy your meal.",
