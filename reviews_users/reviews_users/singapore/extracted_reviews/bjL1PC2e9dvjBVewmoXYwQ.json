    "text": "It is my personal belief that DTF across Singapore comes with different service levels and quality of food levels. Although its a chain restaurant, I seem to find that some places (which shall not be named) are lacking compared to others. In my honest opinion the DTF at Wisma Atria is one of the best I've had in terms of both service and food. I don't think I need to wax lyrical about their dishes, because everyone else here will probably be better able to recommend you what to eat. But if you're going on a budget of around 40 bucks for 2 people here's the combo I'd recommend (and in fact its what I have every single time I go to DTF):1. Xiao Cai for starters2. Xiao Long Bao for sharing3. Fried Rice4. Beef Brisket SoupTah dah! Fills you up in no time.",

    "text": "My parents and I stumbled upon Din Tai Fung after a long day of walking and window-shopping. We were really hungry and decided to try out this restaurant. I've came across Din Tai Fung many times when shopping at Level 4. However, my mom and I never tried the restaurant because the waiting queue is usually really long. It was not until my dad said that Din Tai Fung is a really good restaurant from Taiwan and encouraged us to try it that we finally had dinner there.The food is delicious! You have to try the xiao long bao (juicy pork dumplings) there, or you'll be missing out! It's the juiciest, most delicious dumplings I've ever had. What special about xiao long bao is that there is a little bit of soup inside the dumplings. Dip the dumpling inside soy sauce and vinegar, add a little bit of the ginger (yes you'll be missing out too if you don't eat it with ginger), and it will simply melt in your mouth. We ordered several other dishes, such as pork shop fried rice, shaomai, bean sauced noodle, drunken chicken, and tofu appetizer. They're all delicious. I also love the refreshing dried longan drink. I was looking for it at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, California, but unfortunately they don't have it there :(. Since then, whenever we visit Singapore, we always come to Din Tai Fung. The food is definitely worth the long wait. Besides, there are a few shops around that you could go to while waiting for your number to be called. The kitchen is also see-through, if you want to see how the dumplings are made. Personally, I prefer this Din Tai Fung more than the ones in California because there are more choices available, especially the longan drink (although my favorite Din Tai Fung has to be the one in Taiwan).",

The meals are hot and arrive relatively quickly and they look well presented. But the problem with DTF in Singapore is they do not have a strong sense of the kind of flavors expected of steamed soup dumplings and even the Red Roast Beef Noodles are merely OK in flavor. It needs a lot more of that OOMPH and rarely delivers.",

I devoured a entire bowl and forgot to share with my 2 other diners :) Oops. It's also pretty neat that you can watch them creating dumplings in the kitchen through big glass windows.

    "text": "This was where it happened - my very first xiao long bao.As legends go, all xiao long bao (henceforth known as XLB) virgins pay the price their first time - scalding your tongue on the soup hidden within it's delicate skin. I was torn between letting it happen, or scheming up an escape... but then I thought: why spoil the moment? So I caved and let the XLB do to me what it was meant to; I bit into the plump dumpling, and was I was warned about the hot soup... but gladly got scalded any how. And the flavour... I haven't had any better, and after visiting even the other branches of this store, I don't think I will. Maybe the hands here are magic after all.Being caught up in the fantasy world that is XLB, it's hard to look around you and notice anything else, but of course, when you come up for air, everything is as it should be - the wait staff are mega speedy, and relatively polite (they say hi when they stop by to drop off each dish), they top up your tea often, and it just seems like a well-oiled machine. Before you think XLB is everything that they serve (but it should be), there is a sizeable menu of things that include a super tasty pork chop fried rice, and a mystery mix of veggies called \"xiao cai\". Don't think, just order.I now employ a break-skin-and-slurp-up-soup policy, but you never forget your first time eh?",

    "text": "A famous Taiwanese chain restaurant specializing in steamed dumplings, which are made to order. \u00a0You can tell since they have an open window to the kitchen with a bunch of chefs rolling dough and stuffing dumplings. \u00a0Behind them are stacks of bamboo dished sitting on top of a large steam generator. \u00a0We chose to go to this branch (located in the Wisma Atria Food Republic) for lunch during our last day in Singapore before returning home. \u00a0Overall, great food and decent service.The Xiao Long Bao were probably our favorite - basically these are small pork dumplings that are filled with a little bit of hot broth (as in temperature hot). \u00a0You dip them in vinegar and eat them with extreme caution. \u00a0I usually put an entire one in my mouth, and carefully chew off the edge, which causes some of the broth the seep out. \u00a0I then proceed to eat the rest of the juicy dumpling. \u00a0The temperature was just right - hot but not scalding. \u00a0Bite into one of these things too quickly and you can run the risk of burning the inside of your mouth with a jet of hot soup! \u00a0(No wonder they're translated to Little Dragon Buns). \u00a0The Spicy Pork Dumplings in Red Chili Oil is another Taiwanese classic, and they make it good here as well. \u00a0Very smooth dumpling skins with the right amout of spice.The Braided Beef Noodles is good enough to share with two people - very tender and juicy brisket and chewy noodles.For dessert, we had three little Black Sesame buns. \u00a0The outside was white and smooth, but the insiders were filled with lots of black sesame paste that was sweet and offered a grainy texture to contrast with the outer bun. \u00a0Very tasty and a good way to end the email.Being a famous chain restuarant, prices are generally higher than what you can get at the stalls in the Food Republic. \u00a0Still, this is a good place to go to if you're craving dumplings and want a quieter meal with your own table. \u00a0The various other menu offerings (noodle stoups, sauteed veggies, traditional Chinese dishes) are also good if dumplings aren't your thing.",

They were a bit small and the soup wasn't as flavorful as those I'd eaten elsewhere. The noodles were also a bit disappointing in the flavor department.",

    "text": "I'm going to have to jump on the bandwagon and agree that this Din Tai Fung gets five stars.My friend asked to meet at this one because it's the \"nicer\" one in Singapore. I can see why, it's nicely located in the ritzy Orchard District, located on the lower level of the Wisma Atria Shopping Center. We came for Saturday dinner, and it was packed, but we only had to wait 10 minutes. The people were pleasant, and the service was great! I didn't know this before, but they also provide little rolly baskets for people to put their personal items in next to their tables, which is then covered by a blanket. Such a nice touch instead of having to hang your stuff behind your chair or putting it on the table. The food at DTF is always on point and consistent. Of course we ordered the xiaolongbao's--both salty and sweet version. I personally am a fan of salty xiaolongbao's, but the taro xiaolongbao is good for those with a sweet tooth! Hot and sour soup was very nice, and I usually never order that! Basicaly, you can't go wrong with anything you order here, so go nuts!After your dinner, feel free to walk around the huge shopping center, and it's central to everything so you can really enjoy your day here! DTF is a solid place to go!",

Every branch of Din Tai Fung in the world exhibits consistency in the quality, quantity of food as can be found in their flagship store originated in Taiwan. This alone in terms of quality control impressed me. It is not pricey at all for the consistency and quality of food delivered.Though there may be a tiny adjustments to local taste buds the dishes largely stay true to it's origin and how it was first delivered in Taiwan. However it is still quite an \"international\" flavor than to say it is a true Taiwanese local flavor. It's like eating in the actual Taiwan branch, but in Singapore!",

Simply put, they need to do a better job making sure patrons are all taken care of and that their orders are fulfilled. Oh, and would it kill them to smile?

The xlb skin is the perfect thickness with just the right amount of soup and meat. While the normal one is still the best, the truffle xlb's are worth trying as well.As for the other stuff, I absolutely love the fried rice here (shrimp being my favourite) and I have no idea how they get it to taste so good. The la mian is alright but the ones at crystal jade/paradise are better imo.There's usually a queue at peak times but I find the paragon one moves the fastest out of the town DTFs (though now that the Wisma outlet expanded it's sometimes comparable)",

Love how crispy and not greasy it was.Shrimp fried rice: standard but good.Shrimp and Chinese gourd dumplings: just ok: not that big of a fan of the gourd.Chili crab bun: this was really good, but you order them one each (should have gotten another one).Overall, very similar to the Din Tai Fung's in the US.

We arrived an hour before closing time. Before being able to order, we were told which dumplings \u00a0 they had run out of. My husband does not eat meat so it wasn't nice to hear that all of the fish dumplings and most of the vegetarian options were gone. But then again we were late.So we ordered a concoction of food that was mostly noodles and veggies, and 6 pieces of crab meat & pork dumplings (for me). The order was placed shortly after 9 pm.Everyone around us seemed to be getting food (the place was relatively empty though) fast.Our first order arrived at around 9:35, everything else in about 5-minute-iterations, with a staff member asking us at 9:30 if we wanted to place a last order - which was a tad bizarre, with no other food having arrived yet. Also we had the dumpling-delivery-people stopping by our table often - only to carry on walking again after checking the contents - pretty funny, if you are NOT hungry that is. We finally had nearly all of our food (following a dumpling mix-up), when I was asked to pay and come to the till - where I had to wait for someone else to pay.Back to my- nearly cold - food, the last order arrived: the crab meat & pork dumplings, with samples of black hair. I stopped a waiter who immediately offered a replacement. That took some time, which made the whole experience very late - with the supervisor apologising profusely, for both the wait and the hair situation.All in all, food was just ok. Pretty bland.Two stars for the wait staff, one for food. I guess we just hit a bad day but I won't be back, especially since my husband found that there is a huge difference in quality between here and Taipei. Taipei it shall be then, next time :-)",

Having exposed ourselves exploring Singapore under extreme heat, we couldn't help but finding ourselves dining in a cool AC top-notch restaurant like Ding Tai Fung. This Taiwanese establishment is located right in the heart of Orchard area. Famously known for its Xiao Long Bao, Ding Tai Fung also features a bunch of other dimsum goodness, which we were determined to try them all out.We started with a refreshing dish of Oriental salad. The salad was crunchy and delicious, with standout ingredients like bean sprouts, Korean glass noodles and vinegar, which we believe is a perfect match to create the appetite since vinegar dressing salad is our favorite. Afterwards, here came our Steamed Pork Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Steamed Shrimp & Pork Shaomai, Steamed Vegetable & Pork Buns, and Steamed Finely Mashed Red Bean Dumplings. Of course, the spotlight should be given Xiao Long Bao. Sipping the water inside each bao is wonderful. The inside meat is well-flavored.Recommendation: Xiao Long Bao, Oriental SaladRead our full review at: thecoupleeats.com/singap\u2026",

I think what took the longest about of time was really the food itself, which came out about 20 minutes after being seated. I was okay with this and knew to expect this because one of the servers informed me so. I got the beef noodle soup, spinach with garlic and the pork steamed dumplings. The dumplings are a must! They're perfectly chewy with a great depth of flavor with the soup/meat itself! The beef noodle soup just wasn't for me. I don't think it's horrible, but it just wasn't what I expected. and the spinach was amazing as well - it's definitely a must. It was pretty affordable, which I appreciated as well!The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because the overall experience wasn't great and I have to say that I've had better quality plates at other places. But like a said, it's definitely worth a try!",

These may have been the most authentic buns and dumplings, but they just did not taste as good as some other ones that i have eaten in the past. \"A bit bland\" is probably the best way I can describe the food. Perhaps it was our selections that were off, but there is a bit of pressure when you are not even allowed into the restaurant until you have picked your food! Genuinely had really high food hopes for this places based on previous reviews and personal local recommendations, but for me it was all a bit ....\"meh\" taste-wise. Just scrapes a 3 star rating for dumplings in a shopping centre.",

Order up and share with your table for the best experience!What we Shared:Dumplings: Vegetable & Pork, Chicken, Vegetarian, Shrimp & Pork Shao MaiThe dumplings were delicious and being able to share with the rest of my group made for a really enjoyable dining experience.

We didn't have to wait too long to get seated, and we were able to decide on what to order while we waited so our food was ready very quickly once we sat down. I honestly don't remember everything we had; I just ate and felt happy. There were a couple highlights though:- Xiaolongbao: delicious. I've often had xlb where the soup has leaked out by the time you eat it all. Not the case here. Full of soup, perfectly complemented by the ginger and vinegar.- Truffle xiaolongbao: If you like super strong truffle flavor, you could probably eat many of these. I could only eat one but it felt like the most decadent xlb I've ever had. - Chili crab bun: What's not to love? Chili crab combined with the fluffiest bun...heavenly. - Fried rice: I could have eaten the whole plate. Enough said. - Chocolate/red bean dumpling: I have never tried a dessert dumpling before, and I was a little skeptical of chocolate and red bean combined in a dumpling. But it was delicious. The flavors match really well and the chocolate is so nice and melty. Be sure to save room for this. Din Tai Fung really is the best and it lives up to the hype.",

The staff at the entrance gave me a number and a paper & pen so I could check what I liked to order while waiting. The wait was not bad at all. Good thing I did not have to stand in line. Think I ever mentioned in my other post, I do not like to stand in line, period! Staffs were all friendly and attentive. I like that the restaurant has those bag holders/stands, like those in Taste Paradise, which allow female customers to store their purses or bags. Of cos those at Taste Paradise were a lot better since they came with a flap attached to secure the top. The ones at Din Tai Feng were open bag holders which the staff would just put a cloth over it. Ok I know, I can be so nitpicking.FOOD 4/5The legendary xiao long bao (steamed dumplings) were yummy as expected. I also ordered one red bean bun and one meat bun just to try. They were tiny but were good.AMBIENCE 3/5It was noisy but I did not expect it to be calm and quiet. It was not a place I would suggest for a first date. More like a place for friends to catch up or family lunch.STAFFS 5/5Staffs were attentive, helpful and polite. Water was filled up constantly.",

The dumplings were great, as was the egg fried rice. The drinks were quite pricey - 4SGD for a can of coke, the only cheap option was the 50cent tap water, which they came round to refill a few times. However, the food was good value- 54SGD for lunch for 4 people, and this was cheap compared to most of the other lunch restaurants in the mall.",

We visited a few Din Tai Fung restaurants when we were in Singapore and were blown away at their good quality control. At the same time we also thought that we were just lucky... ;-)Two things that we always ordered in Din Tai Fung were their shrimp & pork shao mai and of course the 18 folds original Xiao Long Bao. DTF's xiao long bao is really in the league of their own. Honestly we never found any broken dumpling skin although I never really counted the number of folds on their dumpling.The shao mai was also always very delicious with plenty of pork meats inside. I always add vinegar to shao mai and the xiao long bao as I love the additional sour flavour on the meat. Of course the price of their dishes are more than the other Chinese restaurants but the quality never disappoints us.",

The Pork Chop Fried Rice, Steamed garlic Spinach, Noodles with Spicy Sauce, Stuffed chillis, the DTF salad and of course, their Xiao Long Bao are all to die for. There's a lot more on the menu to choose from but those are my favourites. The waiting time can be long if you're going during the peak hours, but that's normal for any DTF in the city. The system they have keeps everything going smoothly and if you do have to wait long, it'll be worth it.The only thing that is annoying; and it seems to a problem at all of their outlets, is that most of the people working there don't speak English well. In Singapore, this should be a necessity. However, with the way ordering works, you really don't need to speak to the staff other than when you need to pay.Everyone I've taken to Din Tai Fung has loved it....and I can't imagine why you wouldn't!",

    "text": "Omg! Another great meal, and we totally just lucked into this place. I was at Orchard Road with my mother, and we had entered one of the shopping malls to purchase some stuff from Lush and by the time the shopping was done, it was closing on 9pm, and we both were just super hungry. I had noticed a food court level located in the same mall as the Lust store, so just took the elevetor up there and then looked at Yelp reviews and this one come up tops.Honestly, it wasn't a great first experience as when we approached the restaurant front of staff and asked about vegetarian options for my mother, the lady said there was nothing vegetarian available. But I asked to see menu and there _clearly_ were veg options that mum said she was interested in trying. So we got in and soon afterwards folks were turned away as the restaurant was closing at 10pm. We hurriedly ordered pretty much at random from the menu to be honest (and the list of foods ordered is in my photos), but gosh, all the food we got was so good and scrumptious, each bite was a delight and I walked away super happy to have had the opportunity/ chance to eat here (sometimes the food gods are truly with you!) My one regret however was that in rush of ordering, didn't get to try the XLB so am going to make it my mission once back in US next year, to get myself to a DTF and try this (#foodie 2016 new year resolution!)",
