We actually decided to not eat here at first because we saw no one sitting by the belt which meant the food has been going around for who knows how long. To their credit, the plates are covered with a plastic cover but yeah...that's unappetizing at first sight. After walking around the mall for some time, we circled back around and found 6 different groups eating by the belt so we sat down and started choosing our plates. For $1.50 a dish, I find this place to be an affordable option to curb your sushi craving.",

I finally picked up a salad and a plate that had some kind of sweet fishy red stuff on top. It was horrible. The salad was alright, but I could not eat a second piece of sushi. Every plate is S$1.50 so I left with a $3 bill and an Empty stomach. Just don't try it. Do yourself a favor.",

    "text": "The only thing it has going for it is its price - $1.50 plate is considered cheap in Singapore. I have seen the long lines at the various outlets and have never been inclined to give it a try. A friend did tell me it serves decent food and is an affordable meal for a family of 4, compared to Sakae Sushi or Sushi Tei. I filed that info away. I decided to try it here when I needed a place with no queue and served food fast. At 530pm or so on a weekday evening, it was not that crowded yet. The 50 minutes time limit helped the quick turnover of seats. I still was not sold on the quality of its raw items and stuck mostly on the safer stuff. The sashimi looked sad with thin slabs of fish. There were a decent variety of sushi, with a few not found on the board. It is an efficient operation, with everything laid out nicely for customers, almost like a self-serve place. Cups, teabags, hot water dispenser, chopsticks, soy sauce, saucers, a small packet of wasabi were there to start you off. Then you just watched the sushi zoomed by on the belt. This has to be one of the fastest belts I have ever seen. When the dish of ginger comes along, quickly bring it down from the belt and take the amount you want before putting it back on the belt. I did not really like the mackeral or monk fish liver or lobster salad sushi. The only highlight would be the spinach goma-ae and grilled salmon belly sushi, even though the sushi rice was hard and dry. I tried the miso soup which was different. It was no miso soup as there was barely a taste of miso in the soup. After I got over the shock and tempered my expectation that it was not really miso soup, the soup was actually quite nice. It had lots of salmon and tofu cubes. I would say it was more of a sweetish salmon soup rather than the salty soybean flavor of miso we know so well.An ok place for quick and cheap bites but just do not expect premium quality sushi.",

    "text": "$1.50 a Sushi Plate. Seriously??? Prices this cheap and you are just hoping that the sushi doesn't kill you. However, the sushi was actually pretty good. Not 5-star quality, but more than enough to satisfy one's cravings. The lunch lines here are ridiculously long. As such, its best to come here before noon. The benefits of coming early are two-fold: (i) you miss the rush hour line and (ii) the full selection of sushi options are available to you. Upon taking your seat, immediately say no to the miso soup offer. It's absolutely terrible. Sadly, I made this mistake the first time around. \u00a0I want to reiterate this again the sushi is $1.50 a plate!!! \u00a0It's absurd how cheap that is. I'm a huge fan of Salmon anything, so having three Salmon sushi/sashimi options: Salmon Sashimi, regular salmon sushi and fatty salmon was just over the top. All I can say, is just pick your favorite sushi dishes and dig in. To summarize, the cons and pros of this place are as follows:Cons: Long Lines, limited options during the lunch hour, Service is ehh..., Miso Soup horrendousPros: Sushi is surprisingly good considering the price, Wasabi is kept in personal packets (no need to dig into a Wasabi container that other patrons have done before you), free flow of hot water for tea, Good selection of sushi during certain times. \u00a0There is a saying \"You get what you pay for.\" I'm so glad i didn't get a bad stomach following my meal considering the amount I paid for sushi. :D",

But my experience at Sushi Express is really more sitting at the table, staring at the conveyor belt with plates and plates of sushi, sashimi and other types of food just go past me and I cant pick out more than 3 dishes that I would like to try. I personally think I spend more time trying to find food that looks appetizing than actually eating it. Perhaps Im picky and for the type of prices Im paying, i shouldnt demand too much. But it's just sad staring at food going past and not really wanting to eat them. What I do like about Sushi Express though, is their cute range of Sushi Character merchandises. Marketing wise, they have done a cool job making sushi look cute and personified. I think I'll probably enjoy Sushi Express more as a merchandise shop than an eatery. That said, the food dont taste horrible, just not appetizing. So yes, I'll still come back on days when I feel that I can tolerate cheap Japanese food (or rather when the purse demands a break) but I wont be raving about it.",

    "text": "I have always been curious about the droves of biological mass that plague this establishment whenever I walked past. There have been instances when the anaconda sized lines become somewhat a fire hazard and a semi-road block for people trying to get to or away from the escalators. The sight really increased my curiosity at what could possibly entice people to line up for a conveyer belt sushi manufacturing plant (which I've always considered to be junk sushi).So after walking past more than 10 times...and basing my assumptions on the Singapore bible of foodie behaviors, I believed that this establishment must be a place worth visiting at least once. It must have some form of superb appeal that is magically tempting to constantly maintain a full house of patrons as well as call into existence a line of eager and hungry passers-by glued to their phones awaiting roll call.I joined the queue and found myself seated after 20+ minutes and given a 1 hour limit to dine there. 1 hour? Awesome, I could eat down the house in less than that. I then saw $1.50 per plate promotion. $1.50? Holy crap, that's DIRT cheap even for conveyer belt terms.As always with any conveyer belt establishment (regardless of cuisine), I tend to spend the first 10 minutes staring all the absolute possibilities of dishes they have to offer. Why 10 minutes some may ask? Easy, within 10 minutes, the recall part of your brain would have created an adequate ratio of dishes being \"manufactured\".Sifting through the boring and aiming at the sexier plates, I found only 4 that I would be interested in stuffing myself with.1. 1 pc hamachi sushi - single oversized slab of yellowtail over *dry* sashimi rice.2. 3 pc salmon belly sashimi - with the layers of white awesomeness...but warmer than room temperature (which is kinda...scary)...is worth diving into.3. 2 pc salmon roe sushi - unlike traditional sushi that has a full rack of roe, they split it half with roe and half with a piece of cucumber over *dry* sashimi rice.4. 1 pc cooked scallop with all the frills - you've got to really like scallop to pick this one up.I also agreed to the miso soup (considered one plate) recommended by the server when first seated. DON'T ORDER IT. It is a freaking let-down.Verdict:CHEAP and definitely cheap for good reasons. Lowering my expectations because of the price and finding myself without stomach issues after dining out on higher than room temperature sashimi (I had 6 plates of salmon sashimi; 3 salmon roe sushi, 2 scallops, and 4 - rare and practically never found on the belt - hamachi sushi that I had to ask the lady working the line for)...I would say that this place...is just okay.Yelp 100: 2/100",

Granted that it may be the frozen sort, it was still quite tasty. Took me 3 bites to devour the whole thing. If frozen scallops are not up your alley, Sushi Express also has the fresh hotate. Now that is quite something, especially when it costs 2-4 times the price in your other sushi chains.The rice isn't fantastic. I couldn't taste the vinegar and it wasn't fluffy enough. However most of the toppings were fresh. The salmon roe was good. They also have uni but it has a very strong ammonia taste. Salmon was pretty fresh too.For $1.50 a plate, you really shouldn't be complaining too much. Try it once at least.Do not compare it with Itacho. That's more mid price already. It's better than Sakae. About the same as Ichiban. Below Sushi Tei. Would come back for the scallops maybe.",

If you are craving for chawamushi, this will be one of the few restaurant that does not serve that, as the name of the restaurant implies, they only serve sushi. The only few things I ate was the salmon and the unagi sushi. The salmon was average but not satisfying. The unagi was below average, the fishy smell still lingers and appeared to have kept for quite some time.In conclusion, not an ideal place to wait and queue for a long time when the food serve is so so.",

I find the quality to be on par with Sakae Sushi, though for what you pay it is certainly not going to be Sushi Tei level. Cheap and cheerful is how I will describe it. Just remember to skip the miso soup they try to sell you when you first sit down because that is one fishy nasty soup. Just whack the sushis and you are good.
