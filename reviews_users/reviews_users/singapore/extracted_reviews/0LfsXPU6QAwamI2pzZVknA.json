The safer way to tell which stall is good will be by how long the line is.I only tried the food twice since the renovation. But based on what I had, I liked the Yu Kee Yong Tau Foo very much. I have always like this brand and only had it at Bishan outlet and the old food court at Orchard Emerald. So I am very happy it is available here.The items are standard, different from the other yong tau foo stalls, with 5 pieces of tofu and fish ball/fish cake and the noodles are topped with minced meat. I like the set which includes a side of kang kong drizzled with fermented bean curd. So yummy. The soup is also very sweet and tasty.The mee pok stall is also different with fish maw in it. It is not the best bak chor mee but it is decent. Good choice for Orchard Road. The or luak (oyster omelette) was also nice, especially the chili. Skip the Korean ginseng chicken soup which was very bland.Currently there is a 10% discount if you show your passion card.",

I have been to this food court numerous times in the past few years and have had good experiences on all occasions. Expect to pay higher prices than hawker centres but it is a sophisticated atmosphere.Of note, the stall selling fish bee hoon soup has a very good soup base, better than many other such vendors across the city. The special prawn noodle served in a bamboo leaf from the wok stall is also very good. The charcoal chicken wing stall is also very popular as they grill the chicken wings basically to order.The Yong Tau Food stall is good value with a minimum of 6 pieces. Get it with some noodles or rice and you have a substantial meal for 2 people.There are ladies pushing carts around with various drinks so you can just get your food and sit down and not worry about going to the drink stall.There are plenty of tables/seats and there is also a few 'hidden' areas if the main areas look like they are full - just head towards the far corners and look for the signs for 'more seating'.",

The tables are mostly large wooden tables with big benches. It's so tough to choose where to order from because so many of the options are amazing. There's thai, chinese, and lots and lots of noodles! You can easily purchase a great, large meal (even from multiple booths) and a drink for less than $10.I stayed across the street from Food Republic for about a week and came here for lunch almost every day. My favorite station made fresh noodles on the spot and put them into soups with amazing broths. The bowls were big and delicious. In addition to all the amazing food options, people move cards around the tables with great drink options such as fresh coconut juice. If I have the opportunity to go back to Singapore, I'll rush back to this \"food court\"!",

You will be welcomed by a variety of cuisines and sometimes an overwhelming crowd. I try to come here for lunch around 11am to beat the usual lunch crowd. Queue's are shorter, and more seats to choose from. My favorite is the fish stall where they serve a variety of ways of cooking fish-deep fried and soup. I tried the deep fried dory twice and it was just ok but when I had the soup dish, it's the constant thing that I order every time I'm here. Also, when it comes to beverages, I don't need to come up to the drinks kiosk, I can just wait for auntie to pass by with her cart of refreshing drinks. One time when I was trying to veer away from the usual lime juice that I order, auntie was really helpful in suggesting other drinks and I opted for the lychee-just to try something new.When you come here, and it happens to be crowded, remember to look for more seats through those corridors and not just settle on the seats you see. Chances are, you might end up a window seat with a great view of Orchard road.",

    "text": "The newly renovated food court at Wisma Atria Level 4 is finally open to public about a month ago! The folks from the Breadtalk Group really know how to make a difference with their food courts - which gives them such an edge above the rest. Each food court has a theme - though most of it relates to our Singaporean heritage, there are some subtle differences. For the most famous Food Republic (and probably with the most expensive rent) it is all back to basics of our Singaporean food roots with the revamp this time round and they have decorated it with all types of vintage items from our past which gives it a really nostalgic flavour and makes it distinctly Singaporean, even if some of the stalls in there hail from different countries and serve other cuisines. It is after all our heritage to have a mishmash of everything. There is a total of 23 stalls, 3 mini restaurants and 1 kiosk. How's that for spoilt for choice? I need to eat at this food court whenever I am in town next time and not bother thinking about restaurants.I would recommend that you make a beeline for their Odeon Beef Noodles - where my favorite is the dry noodles that comes with soup that packs a punch. Otherwise there is always the safe choice of Thye Hong Hokkien noodles which made this branch famous in the first place when it first opened. People are still queuing to this date, which is good. Their Indonesian Padang stall also has rather hefty meals that is sure to fill up a hungry person or 10.",

The ingredients are fresh, a little cold, but it enhances the experience (Cold Rojak... now that's an idea!).

The Taiwanese one - Forgot the name, but their claim to fame is beef noodle soups using thick noodles cut by hand. \u00a0Supposedly the method of cutting imparts superior texture to give a nice, chewy noodle. \u00a0We ordered both the beef dumplings and steamed pork dumplings from this place and they were both fresh and tasty.2. There was one stall that made Laksa (traditional noodle in soup) and Laksa Goreng (noodles only). I liked how they offered you the choice of noodle to use. \u00a0Laksa had the usual thin fish slices, shrimp, and some sort of shellfish (cockles perhaps?). \u00a0Flavors were bold and intense at the same time.3. Soup Guru(?) - My wife liked this one and went here a few times for traditional Chinese soups. \u00a0I liked how they described each soup in English and the traditional health benefits of each.4. They had an Indian restaurant (specializing in Biryani) next to an Indonesian restaurant (with their own special chicken set). \u00a0I tried the Chicken Biryani this time and its quite good. They gave a whole small bird with skin and all and a good side of rice and some pickled veggies, all plated on a banana leaf. The \"Biryani sauce\" was given as a side. \u00a0Overall it was good - a little different than Biryani I've had here in the USA, but still good.5. Sergeant Chicken - they offered both steam and roasted Hainanese Chicken Rice here for just $4 SGD. I opted for the steamed version and was glad I did. \u00a0I never knew that such as a simple dish could have so much flavor. \u00a0The rice itself was seasoned with broth and you can always add more with the side of soup they gave you. \u00a0The chicken can be eaten with the minced ginger or with the spicy chili oil.6. The fruit juice place is pretty decent too. \u00a0They charge slightly more if you decline ice in the drinks. \u00a0Coconut juice is actually a whole baby coconut with a good amount of juice and coconut meat to chew on. \u00a0The mango and guava(?) are also good with the right amout of tart to help sooth a spicy meal. \u00a0I think one of the ladies working here also preloads a bunch of the drinks onto a cart and sells them by bringing the drinks throughout the court - which is really efficient.Our least favorite stall is probably the Fish Porridge one on the corner. \u00a0My wife expected a nice smooth congee but instead got this clear soup with cooked rice and fish meat mixed in.",

I wouldn't call this a relaxing dining experience but if you're looking for a place to satisfy your hunger at a good price then this is a good choice.It's noisy, chaotic and sometimes very crowded but the food is very good.Make sure to bring your own napkins - no one provides or sells any.",
