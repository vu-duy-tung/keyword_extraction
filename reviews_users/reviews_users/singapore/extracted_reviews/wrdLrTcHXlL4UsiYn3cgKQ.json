I requested my ice coffee with ice cream and they were happy to do it despite my request not being on the menu. Pricing is a little higher than most but is what I expected given it is western food.",

    "text": "There are a few times in life when a meal overwhelms your senses with craftsmanship and complexity. This meal is not it. It is middle of the road fare at unreasonable prices. Very unremarkable food that certainly could be better prepared in the home kitchen. I ordered an $11 banana-blueberry smoothie expecting a taste that justifies the price. Instead, I received a blueberry smoothie without the banana because the kitchen had none in stock. I wasn't even given a choice to decline or change my order, rather it was served to me expecting me to just take it. I did, because I don't like causing a scene, and it was as disappointing as my $13 breakfast sandwich with $5 has brown top up as their dishes don't come with sides. Sad!",

I heard that they use to give discounts to students studying for their yoga teaching certificate at Tirisula, but sadly that's no longer the case.Best coffee in Arab Street! My favorite order is the Mexican salad with organic chicken and fresh guacamole. Fresh greens, shredded chicken, and zesty guac--me encanta! Other yogis have ordered the Mongolian beef salad and salmon salad. Also quite good! I've also tried their toast, and loved the honey they have! Would def. come back for some food if I'm in the area!",

I went with a friend who's a very healthy eater, and judging by the big lunch crowd, it seems to be a nice respite from all the other not-so-healthy eateries in the area.I tried the Brazilian chicken over couscous and it was everything I wanted. Juicy skewered chicken with lots of flavour but not very spicy, gently placed over couscous that had dollops of pesto and the best goat cheese I've tasted in a while. Factor in the texture, and it went so well together. Top it off with a good olive oil, and daaaaaamn son!It appears they have a decent coffee menu and some bar concoctions, but the food left such a great impression on me that I wouldn't mind re-visiting and trying more on the menu.",

    "text": "So I chanced upon this place after seeing danielfoodiary visit this on instagram. So I got some deal.com.sg vouchers and got 4 other friends to check it out.Here is the store front, it's at the edge of Arab street, I walked about 5 minutes from Bugis MRT Exit D (Downtown line)Once you enter the shop, you will see the bar and front counter, sadly all those sandwiches up on the chalkboard were not available for dinner. I was so looking forward to trying the fully sick sandwich. I guess I have to come back here during lunch time then!So here is their 2 page dinner menu. It is not a lot of items, but it is good, as you don't have to waste too much time picking items. As a group of 5 we decided to pick a bunch of appetizers1. Cracker Squid ($13)The squid was okay, the batter could be crispier, the tartar sauce was okay. The dish looked presentable, but it just didn't taste as good as I had hoped it to be.2. Squid Taco, Pulled Pork Taco, Fish Taco ($8 each)For the pulled pork, that was apparently cooked for 12 hours, it tastes not too bad. Generally pulled pork is very sweet and this wasn't too sweet. I only wish the taco was the crispy corn kind, rather than the flat bread kind. This had me missing my Doritos Tacos for 99 cents in the US!3. Lotus Root Croquettes ($12)I decided to order this as I found this to be interesting, instead of one lotus root, it was all mashed up and shredded up. Pretty much like a mashed sweet potato breaded and fried. I found it a bit strange. The cilantro dip was not too bad, I liked the spices and it added some flavour to the sweetness of the lotus root.4. Truffle Hot Chips ($8)Pretty decent truffle chips, you could definitely smell and taste the truffle oil. My friends even commented that it might be better than Habitat's truffle fries! A pretty good compliment if I might say so myself. They are generous with the fries for just $8 nett. 5 of us each had a good share of it!Main Courses :1. Steak Out ($18)I saw a comment on facebook that their steak was juicy and tender and decided to give it a try. We ordered it Medium and it did come Medium! Hurray! for cooks who know what they are doing! The steak was indeed juicy, tender and not dry! I enjoyed it thoroughly. I would definitely order it again if I was here for dinner.2. Pork Yakitori ($15)For $15, I think this dish is overpriced, unlike the japanese yakitori, this did not taste like it had the yakitori sauce/teriyaki sauce on it. It reminded me of the halal kebabs, not sure why. The potato salad on the side though, was amazing! It tasted like a egg/carrot/potato salad? I am not exactly sure what ingredients went into it, but it was more amazing than the yakitori itself. The yakitori was okay, it was juicy, tender, it was abit hard getting the meat off the stick, but at least the meat wasn't dry.Desserts :1. Brownie ($6)Apparently one of their best sellers, this brownie looked very humble, but once you dig your dessert spoon into it, you realize that it is very dense. Unlike most brownies that you would eat and feel gerlat, \"heaty\", or feel like you're about to get a sore throat the next morning. This brownie gives you that same sensation but not to that extreme. I feel that it would be well paired up with the SegaFreddo, but not at $10 more.2. SegaFreddo ($10) - Brandy Hazelnut GelatoThe cheerful waitress recommended us to try this Brandy infused, hazelnut gelato. There were indeed alot of whole hazelnuts in this Gelato, but I could hardly taste the Brandy. Even though the waiter who served it to us, asked us to eat it with caution, as if we would be completely tipsy from eating the dessert. It was a nice dessert, but definitely not worth $10. We spent a total of $125 for 5 people, with the deal vouchers. It was a worthy dining experience. The shop itself seats at very most 15 pax, I hope they would consider serving the sandwiches during dinner, as I believe it would attract more customers.The service was good and throughout the 2 hours that we were there, the nice Indian lady asked us several times if we needed service, water top up, or any food recommendations as she knew that we were looking for ways to spend the $125.",

First, the service is very bad: server had no idea what the dishes included (do they include cheese, do they come with bread); the dishes were served one, then two, then the last one came after the first three finished eating. Second, the food was meh: potatoes were undercooked, shaksouka came without egg.. very meh. Third: all the brunch dishes included a single egg. Surely one would want more than one egg on toast? Of course we could've ordered more, but this brings me to fourth: the prices are way too high for what you get. I'm surprised this place has 3 stars.",

    "text": "Went to this place for brunch and was pretty underwhelmed. The coffee was good here but everything else was at or below average. I wasn't feeling hungry so I just got the sourdough toast with butter and honey with a side of bacon. There were 2 small slices of bread, which actually made sense because the toast only cost 3.50. \u00a0There was a pack of butter and what appeared to be honey in a small dish. Whatever it was, it was not honey. It tasted more like evaporated milk but whatever, it was still sweet. The bacon was 7 dollars and I got 3 generous strips. Pretty decent for Singapore standards I guess. My toast had some avocado bits and smudges on it which was kind of unsettling. It didn't bother me that there was avocado on the toast, it bothered me that they were messy and careless in the kitchen. My sister got the \"stoner surprise\" (stupid name) which was an eggless waffle topped with strawberries and blueberries. It also came with a side of maple syrup. It looked really photogenic if you get what I mean but it didn't look appetizing at all. She wasn't impressed with the taste. There are so many of these cafes in Singapore now and they're all pretty much the same. The coffee is good but the food is mediocre and overpriced.",
