    "text": "Spizza is a really great place and i honestly don't understand why people wouldn't like this place. They provide both indoor and outdoor seating, take reservations and carry out deliveries. The d\u00e9cor isn't bad, even though the building is old and it's pretty clean too. The only reason it's at a 4 star is because the desert menu didn't have much variety. However, the main course, Pizza's and Appetisers definetly made up for it. The waiters were friendly and did their jobs well, the Pizza's were great and the Burratina was awesome and so was the Calamari. I highly recommend you try the 'Isabella'. Its truly a masterpiece. The Ravioli was pretty good too. Definitely a great place for a Pizza lover and an even better place for families. If you love Pizza, you'll definitely love this place.",

It was absolutely delicious. Would love to see more gluten free items on the menu, but at least they have GF penne which can be combined with any of their \"classic\" sauces including tomato, aglio olio, etc.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I have different opinions from other yelpers. Hidden along the streets of Bukit Timah is this place called Spizza. You will see it on the roads if you happen to travel along Bukit Timah and if you pass by a building called Balmoral Plaza.When I first saw this, I was like \"meh\", another pizza store. But I was so wrong. One of my ex-tutor actually recommended this place to me and my mother tried it first. She said it was \"alright\" but I decided to give it a try since I come by Balmoral Plaza regularly - mom's work place.Spizza opens at 12pm on weekdays. So every time my mother and I come by here, it would always be empty and we will be the first to be greeted then seated customers. The waiters are always friendly and approachable. They always carry smiles with them when we walk in to the store till we walk out of the store. This makes me come back to this Spizza chain regularly - excellent customer service.What I like to get from this chain? There are some regular dishes that I enjoy and will not go without upon entering this place.First of all, Aglio Olio. The noodles were cooked in perfection and the ingredients were just right making it not soggy. With or without prawns (shellfish allergens like myself) is the same pricing. I like the taste as it is not too strong in terms of the olive oil used.Second dish, Quinta Pizza. It is thin crusted pizza with tomato base, shredded and baked mozzarella, runny egg (egg white and egg yolk) in the middle of the pizza and black truffle paste spread out nicely on the pizza itself. Why I specifically order this pizza? I love the crunchy thin crust texture of the pizza as it is crispy. It also has stronger truffle taste which will linger in your tongue for awhile after consuming it. The pizza comes in 8 slices for the medium sized and sometimes I tend to eat at least half of the portion together with the Aglio Olio. Tara (Tomato, Mozzarella, Egg, Bacon, Button Mushrooms) has egg in the center also but I still love Quinta more.Dessert, Tiramisu is one of the best (that's what I always order if I have empty stomach left for dessert cravings). Will try CIOCCOLATA and ORANGE CR\u00c8ME BR\u00dbL\u00c9E in the near future.Drinks, I tend to order coolers (Spizza Signature Cooler - Passionfruit and Peach 'Bellina'). The combination of fizzy drinks are considered smart move. Ambience wise for this restaurant was pretty classy, simple yet modern. It is definitely a good place to hang out during tea time. Will definitely be back for more rounds of delicious foods. Bon Appetit!Update: tried the Orange creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but wasn't a wow factor for me :(",

I sat outside but it is near Bukit Timah so very noisy.The service however is friendly but slow and unorganised. Asked for bill 4 times before getting it.. Didn't get my drink order till after pizza was finished.Good idea, ok good but poorly executed. No need to go back.",

    "text": "This Spizza and I have a nice little thing going. Every Wednesday night after my meeting down the road, I head over to Spizza where they have my corner table waiting for me and my laptop. I order, hop online and start to work and the pizza is ready in no time. Plus, they bring me extra napkins so degrease my fingers as I eat and type (the American in me just won't eat pizza with a fork and knife unless I'm in polite company and my laptop just doesn't count).Spizza's pizzas are solid: good crust, generally fresh sauce and decent ingredients. I am partial to the Isabella (parma ham, tomato, mozzarella and rucola salad) but I also haven't tried everything on the menu just yet. The Margherita pizza is not up to par: they claimed to use buffla mozzarella and fresh basil, but the pizza I got just had the cheap stuff and no basil. But if you stay away from that, your overall experience should be good.",

    "text": "Spizza is a decent place serving thin crust pizzas - great for dining there when you're not feeling particularly hungry. Prices are decent, with 1 pizza usually being good for 2 to share. The outlet at Bukit Timah is located in a relatively low key shopping mall, and is great for family dining. The reason why this branch of Spizza only gets 2 stars is because it's not hard to find better quality pizzas in Bukit Timah - Peperoni and Casa Verde spring to mind, with both being relatively comparable in prices to Spizza. It's decent, but don't expect mind-blowing orgasmic food.",
