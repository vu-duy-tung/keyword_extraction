But could only find 2 popular dishes with my google search. I should have taken note on the items I saw on the Travel channel and there were quite a few.Service was fast and friendly and very welcoming.Next time I will hopefully go with someone that is more familiar with the cuisine so we can order it mild and try more items.",

    "text": "First to review for this year of 2015 for this restaurant.After coming back from my medical mission trip in Yangon, back in May 2015, I was wondering where I could find Burmese food and I was told about this place through the Burmese people I came across and of course Yelp.My mother was asking me on where we should eat that day and she mentioned she wanted to get turntable from Peninsula Plaza. And straightaway, I told her about wanting to eat Burmese food without much hesitation.Picked her co-worker up and she drove to Peninsula Plaza. Parking was confusing and we ended up going to a carpark lift that has only 2 levels (1st or 6th). We reached the 6th floor after being transported by the lift for a few minutes but it was cool to see the surrounding environments as we sat in the car.There was a parking attendant and she told us that we can only do a daily fare not hourly. And the parking rate per day is $20. She also asked us whether we are ok with it or else we could park somewhere else. My mother insisted to park at Peninsula plaza itself so her co-worker did what was asked.There lifts inside peninsula plaza was confusing. There were 6 lifts but only two can take us to the basement level. We decided to walk out the lobby and take escalator to reach this restaurant instead.We chose a seat that we wanted to have but later on was asked to move and switch to another as they were about to repair the air conditioner. I was browsing the menu and was pretty quick in deciding what to eat as some of the dishes were labeled by three signs (recommended, spicy and very spicy). Like usual, I always go for the chef recommended dishes - Mohinga (noodles) and half a portion of gourd fritters (top up $1.50 more). The dish was very flavorful. Although it doesn't look like the picture (more colorful), it has quite a few ingredients that explode in the tastebuds. My mother tried Shan Khau Hswe. It is like Pad Thai but I still prefer my dish over hers. Her co-worker ordered Myanmar Fried Kway Teow and it was average. The gourd fritters was pretty well cooked. It had golden brown outer layer and was crunchy during bites. I wasn't able to taste the sauce provided.For beverage, tried the Sakyalama. Was pretty good even though it was a fake bird nest drink. But can get too sweet if they pour too much of the red colored syrup (like the case of my mother's co-workers').Overall, even though my mother was kind of disappointed with what she ordered, I was happy with my choice of dish. Service was fast and efficient as well. Will be back to try some other dishes soon.",

Boyfriend who doesn't even normally like fished loved the flavour of the soup. Lots of assam/shredded catfish, banana blossom (apparently, i thought it was lotus root - similar type of texture), and very soft onions!Tea leaf salad was a small portion but also yummy, gd textures of crunchiness! As always, love it :)Hsan win makin (Burmese cake fr semolina flour) was quite heavy/rich w coconut cream. V warm and yummy! Can see how it'd go well w ice cream. Reminded me a bit of kueh, actually.Bf's grass jelly was nice and refreshing, with a touch of lime. also had hydrated thai basil seeds (tadpole egg looking things) inside, nice addition of slight crunch too!",

Do not miss: the fermented tea leaf salad (tangy, spicy with chilli, so ask for it unmixed), the various vegetable fritters, the deep fried pork sausage, the mohinga (a breakfast noodle dish, but hey). Inle has a number of meal sets that are very good value, depending on your appetite, but the best way really is to come with friends, so that you can have a little of everything!",

Mohinga soup was tasty with quite a bit of fish bits which reminded me a little of Penang-style Laksa soup.Had the Hsanwin Makin (semolina flour cake) for dessert. Was nice and warm, starchy and moist with raisins inside. \u00a0My gf pointed out it tastes somewhat like a nonya kueh.Overall, very pleasant ambiance with amazingly abundant seating and reasonable prices. Worth paying a visit especially if you've never had Burmese food before - get the tea leaf salad! ;)One last point: I'm no expert on Burmese food, but when we were there most of the tables around us were Burmese customers, so this place should be pretty authentic.",
