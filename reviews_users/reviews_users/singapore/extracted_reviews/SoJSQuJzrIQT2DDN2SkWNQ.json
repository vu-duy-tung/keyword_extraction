    "text": "Popped by here for a lazy Saturday lunch, and I felt the food was just okay.Nothing fantastic, and slightly pricey, though I understand costs are rising these days (inflation, guys). The Itek Tim (duck soup) was way too salty - perhaps they could have washed the salted vegetables a bit more? The century egg tofu sauce was too dilute (too little century egg), but what really got me were the raw salted egg yolk bits, which stuck to my teeth and were cumbersome to remove. It was a really pretty dish though.The lamb shank rendang was really good though - I thought it was the highlight of the meal for me. The prawn paste pork, yeah, it was meh. Oh the desserts, the durian cake was a rip-off, and on the light side. I prefer my durian cakes heavy as durian IS heavy.Would I return? Maybe. To give it a second go and order things I didn't try.",

The sambal chilli is a killer!!2) Miso Cod & Ulam Onigiri, S$32The savory over-roasted fish was succulent but the belachan assam herb rice balls doesn't seem to compliment well. Accompanied by refreshing cucumber salad in plum sauce and lime juice dressing.3) Creatures Laksa, $24(available only on Friday Dinner, Full Day on Sat, Sun and PH)Generous ingredients (fresh prawns, quail eggs, chicken, fish cakes and cucumber laces) that make the value worth. The flaming sunset bowl of thick broth offers a distinctive dried shrimp and rich coconut milk and spice. The amazingly tasty quintessential nonya laksa will tickle the tastebuds and leave you wanting for more. Served with al dente thick vermicelli and yellow noodles.4) Ah Gong Fried Chicken & Ah Ma noodles, $22Ah Ma Noodles were perfect texture and QQ. Tossed in aromatic shallot and light soy. So simple yet comforting.Ah Gong fried chicken leg is crisp with juicy tender meat under the crust. However the garam masala needs more kick. Good on its own without the chinchalok mayonnaise.5) Durian Cake, $12The Chantilly cream-frosted pandan genoise sponge cake is not only a velvety beauty. The layered thick Mao Shan Wang durian paste and clumps of the pungent fruit's flesh is also divine. We licked clean within minutes!Check out my instagram for photos of the above.",

    "text": "Lovely interior!!! Definitely has nice ambiance and decor but I personally think this place is overrated. As a fan of Peranakan food, my expectation for Peranakan restaurant (albeit fusion) is pretty high.We had both overly salted prawn pork prata with keluak and babi pongteh. I couldn't taste the prawn at all though. Babi pongteh would be excellent if they could tone down their salt seasoning just a little bit because the meat was already perfect. Pumpkin soup was decent, edible but not fantastic. Was supposed to go with youtiao but they ran out of it so settled with baguette which is not a good combo actually.Durian cake was the only thing that's above average. They gave generous real durian on two layers.Oh and pandan lemongrass drink was really good and perfect for humid afternoon. So refreshing.On a side note, I noticed the restaurant was dominated by female customers, I think most probably because the food portions were quite tiny. So one star for decor, one star for durian, one star for the lemongrass drink!I don't think I'll be returning. No, wait, maybe just for the drink and durian cake.",

I wonder if they just went down the road and got some prata from the prata man. Probably not, but I think they should. Signature chocolate cake is decent, and comes swimming in a sea of salted caramel.",

    "text": "Love this spot and I'm thankful to Michelle M. and whoever the Yelper was that posted the picture of the PRAWN & PORK BUAH KELUAK ON PRATA which is one of those few plates around the world that totally made me close my eyes and savor it. Also the Rainbow Cheesecake is the best cheesecake I've ever eaten in my life - and I used to live and eat for a living in the home of cheesecake - NYC.Nearly every dish that I've tried here is a 5+ star taste, all of it feeling like a first-class home cooked meal. The staff is all extremely friendly and helpful and the setting is well-done in this Little India spot.As mentioned above, it is a must to order the Prawn & Pork Buah Keluak on Prata and both the Rainbow Cheesecake or the Durian cake (or any of their desserts really).Other items I recommend:- Lemongrass and pandan tea - Do it iced if you need something refreshing. Very flavorful!- Honeydew Saketini - I've never had as well done a sake cocktail with two flavors that go so well together as fresh honeydew melon and nigori sake. I think I gulped this in two sips!!!! Very light!- Ah Gong Fried Chicken & Ah Ma Noodles - This hit the spot. Homemade noodles and fried chicken - can't go any better than that.- Coconut Affogato - If you aren't feeling cake, try this. I already love Affogatos (vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso) but doing it with Coconut ice cream is like that windows shattering in your head when you find your favorite dessert can actually be better. Very well done!They have a solid lunch special for a great value which I'd highly recommend either casually with friends, family or on a nice intimate date. They serve lunch until 3:30pm too so you have a lot of time to make it happen!",

I had a good feeling I would enjoy visiting, so Cristina and I decided to take a metro to Creature's spot. As we walked past, I was hoping to not miss it, but quickly noticed the cool door and rosemary herbs growing in front of the window. I then looked at the sign and seen \"CreatureS.\" We walked into the restaurant and immediately greeted by the waitress, then shown to a table. I already knew what I wanted, so I quickly ordered a bottle of wine, which was reasonable in price compared to other in the city. I then ordered an appetizer of Asian fries, which were thin potato fries served with kaffir lime mayonnaise and we devoured these. As a main course we ordered the Ah Gong fried chicken and Ah Ma noodles which is a crispy leg of chicken dipped in a garam masala crust, and served with chinchalok mayonnaise and la-mein tossed in shallot and light soy. We also ordered the Zhu burger, which is a pork patty marinated with Xo congna. Amazing!!! As desert we shared a scoop of lemongrass & ginger ice cream. I must say, visiting this place made be fall in love with Singapore. I know I am coming back again and bringing some friends with me too.",
