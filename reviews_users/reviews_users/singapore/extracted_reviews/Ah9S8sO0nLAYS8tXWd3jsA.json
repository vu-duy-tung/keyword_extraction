    "text": "I'm obsessed with Mexican food. I had it at least once a week in California. You can imagine my excitement when I read that there was a Baja Fresh in Singapore. It's no taqueria but for being 9,000 of miles away, it is pretty awesome. There are fancy Mexican restaurants around but they don't serve simple burritos and tacos, and prices are extra steep. I ordered the Mexicana burrito with rice, chicken and beans. That's typically what I order in California. It was the right size and flavor, but the beans were way undercooked. I think they use dried black beans here, which is perfectly fine, but they need to be soaked longer. In the US, tortilla chips tend to be freshly deep fried before they are served. That way, they are warm and crispy. Here, they don't do that, which gives the chips a little bit of a stale flavor. If they would warm up the chips, that would be awesome! The salsas are perfect though, no complaints there! The roasted chile salsa is exactly like how I remember it, and I really appreciate the pickled jalapenos too. All in all, this is a step up from when all we had in Singapore was Taco Bell and fancy Mexican. We need these mid-level fresh \"fast food\" restaurants like Baja Fresh and Chipotle. I'm very thankful to whoever brought Baja Fresh to Singapore, and I'm sure the 25,000 Americans living here probably feel the same way!",

I went for the baja burrito which was filled with chicken, tomatoes, onions and guacamole. You get a bag of tortilla chips for free, for which you can grab a salsa (or more) from the free float salsa bar. The flavours were Ok, but for 10$ I would expect a bit more special.",

I got the Baja burrito with no meat, and got it stuffed with veggies. Side note: if you don't like capsicum (bell peppers) like me, you will spend heaps of time removing them!My burrito came pretty quickly, and all orders come with free chips, which you can get your salsa fix at the salsa bar, which allows you to get as much as you want. I wouldn't say their salsa is amazing, but it is hard to get good tomatoes in Singapore, so I can't say I blame them. There are varying spice levels of salsa for your choice, but I got heaps of cilantro and lemon and stuffed my burrito with them both. The burritos here are pretty large so come here hungry or get them to cut it in two so you can share with a not-so-hungry friend. Pay $2.25 extra for a drink.",

They are not super prevalent in Texas and they are a tad pricier than the first two I mentioned. I heard that there was a Baja Fresh in Singapore. \u00a0I have been craving Chipotle pretty much since the day we landed in Singapore. We sought out the Baja Fresh and I am so glad we did! I had a chicken bowl and the portion was HUGE. There is a salsa bar to jazz up your food (even though none of it is too spicy) and my very picky children loved the queso. They have very refined queso pallets. They consider themselves experts!The service was fast and the staff was friendly. They also had a deal where if you checked in on FaceBook, you got a free order of cinnamon churros! They staff was so kind to bring two orders (one for each of my children). My children have those rave reviews too! I believe Baja Fresh will be in regular rotation for us!",

I tried a bite to judge for myself and I almost gagged. Wow, that was disgusting. It's either really old fish, or really bad, but it definitely didn't taste like mahi mahi. It was totally disgusting. I was surprised my wife ate her meal and felt really bad for her at the same time.I guess you can't really compare to a US Baja Fresh restaurant, but this doesn't much resemble a Baja Fresh... they are doing the franchise a big disservice if this is how Asia will be introduced to the Baja Fresh brand.This used to be my most favorite chain mexican restaurant in California... now I shudder at the thought of going to it again.Also, the prices are pretty ridiculous. $33 for 2 tacos and a burrito.No wonder the place was more than half empty during dinner time.",

I really love their burritos - I'd have an Ultimo steak burrito if I'm starving as the rice in it gets you pretty full up, or the Baja on a normal hunger scale as its got guacamole, meat and tomatoes but no rice.You can choose between chicken, beef, shrimp, pork or fish options, so there's something for everyone! Every set comes with a serve of nachos, and free flow servings of freshly made salsa and salsa sauces. I always go nuts on the fresh salsa. They promise that everything is fresh, so nothing from a can or freezer is used -which makes a remarkable difference. No reservations here, just walk ins so be prepare to wait if you come after 7pm. Fortunately, people leave quite quickly after eating so waiting time won't be too long. Ambience isn't great, but it's clean and comfortable, so i really enjoy my meals there.",

The concept is very much fast food a fast food restaurant style, you line up, order, pay and sit down to have your meal.It's a little pricey compared to McDonald's but the food quality you get is plenty better.

Most Mexican places here are more of a sitdown, bougie (read: Bourgeoisie) style where you'll pay 20 bucks for a taco. Because it would be a cold day in hell (theres a joke in there about Singapore's weather somewhere) before I'd pay that much for a burrito, I spent a good amount of time on the hunt.After many sweaty treks through the city searching for a burrito, I happened to pass Baja Fresh one day on the way home. My prayers had been answered! While not 'the best thing I've ever had', Baja Fresh definitely hit the spot and fulfilled my craving. It's a shame that there's not more places where you can get a grab-n-go burrito (for a city that prides itself on eating, this is even more surprising). Alas, if you're like me, an American craving some south of the border fare, Baja Fresh will suffice.",

So you place your order at the counter and will be given a number, after which a wait staff will pass you the food.We were so confused when we first tried to order too! Everything is new to us, and there are not many pictures we can use as reference on the menu. The counter staff was really helpful though - she patiently explained each food to us and made recommendations.Really enjoyed the taco chips they gave as appetizers as well which you can dip into 5 types of salsa. Very fun!Our food was also very good. It was fresh! I never thought mexican food to be like that to be honest. Always had the image that it's all guacamole and beans.Go try it out now and see what I mean!",

It was confusing.The meal was ok, really filling portions of nachos, tortillas, chicken(filling choice), cheese and drinks. it's free-flow salsa, 4 choices with my favorite being the 6-chile blend. They have a really general range of tex-mex food on their menu though; burritos, quesadillas, tacos, fajitas & nachos. The Mexicans will be angry they call these Mexican.They have an amazing group of staff working for them though and I like how these people made my experience at Baja Fresh so much better.

Be warned though, although this is technically a 'fast food joint' you are not going to be paying fast food prices. Its a bit pricey, but you are definitely getting what you pay for. All their food is made fresh and served fresh with really good ingredients. Portions are huge and you can help yourself to the salsa bar where there are different types of salsa. They also serve alcohol here which you dont see in other fast food restaurants. Id say one of the best places to get Mexican food in Singapore.",

    "text": "When Baja Fresh's location was under renovation I was quite excited, because hey, tacos, and I don't have to go to Phoenix Park for it! Unfortunately, it's fast food that tries to be fresh but isn't really--don't get me wrong, it's not that the lettuce is wilting, but when you know that the char marks aren't real and the guacamole tastes like avocado juice from the Indonesian stall there isn't much that brings me back. There is a certain honesty in properly trashy fast food like Taco Bell, IMHO. That said, Taco Bell doesn't do beer. :)",
