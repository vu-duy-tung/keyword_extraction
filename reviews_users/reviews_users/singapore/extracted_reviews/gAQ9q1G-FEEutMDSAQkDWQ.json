Very nice ambience and parking is free!I had ordered a steak and a grilled fish with my partner. The steak is prepared to the best taste and my partner also really love the grilled fish. To top it up, my good friend knew the chef and I had a special dessert for my birthday celebration! Love the attention and the service there. I will definitely return again!",

    "text": "There's only so much fish, and so many bowls of noodles, meat, and vegetables one American can eat when traveling in Singapore. Sometimes you just need a PIZZA. But where can a guy from NYC possibly find a good pizza in a place like Singapore? Look no further than Ristorante Pietrasanta.These guys could give the pizza from Brooklyn a run for its money. The pizza here is amazing. I can only vouch for the one pie I ordered, but it will be a lasting memory until I head back to Singapore a few months from now. Let it be known that I am a black truffle whore. I can't get enough of these magical bits of heaven. And here they make a Tartufo Nero pizza -- essentially a white pie with black truffle pesto and truffle oil. To say it is delectably rich would be an understatement. It is among the best things I \u00a0have ever eaten. It was almost a shame that I preceded it with a giant arugula salad, as it took up room in my stomach where another slice of pizza could have fit. The greens were super fresh, but I didn't love the texture of the sun-dried tomatoes, and the lemon and Parmigiano-Reggiano dressing was too light to hold up against the bitter, peppery arugula. My wife, however, would love have loved this salad. Next time I come here I will not dine alone and will bring others so we can try more of the food. The burrata and the pasta dishes I saw walking by me all looked amazing. It's so nice to know you can come to Asia and find real authentic Italian food. Hats off to Giuseppe and Chef Loris -- you guys are awesome!",

Pricing and location might be the only two quibbles but they are minor ones.We had to go with the much-touted burrata for our starters. The burrata was fresh and creamy, proving to be a great start to our meal. For mains, my boss had pappardelle ragu while our counterparts and myself enjoyed the lobster pasta, which was a daily special. There was a generous serving of lobster and the pasta was done al dente, which worked for me. Desserts too were a treat, with sorbet and ice-cream rounding up the meal very nicely.I also would like to highlight the top notch service of the place, with the staff attentive to our needs throughout. Definitely worth a return visit.",

    "text": "Booking was professional. They confirmed the day before by sms. We got indoor seating as the heat these days is just horrendous. Everyone gets a little shot glass of tomato sauce to dip the bread. Warning the foccacia is more like their pizza crust with herbs on and it costs about $7.50 a basket. Worth getting though.They offered us sparkling or iced or warm water so it's nice they didn't try to push only bottled water.Vibe of the restaurant was buzzy, noisy, lots of chatting..family style communal sharing was welcome. Bear in mind..Friday night.Highlight of the meal was the daily special..Burrata for $40. Big round pouch of burrata..it was heavenly creamy so fresh and so tasty. Totally worth it and they brought a special bottle of olive oil to eat with it. Yummy thick dark yellow one. It went great on our 2nd basket of foccacia.We all agreed the seafood soup was a good buy for about $14 (can't rem too busy eating), the server very readily volunteered to split all the seafood soups into 2 portions for us to share.Nice surprise, the pastas and pizzas were rather affordable! A lot of pizzas were about $20 or less. We only had one..a ham and mushroom. It's not the super thin crispy type but I actually prefer one with a bit of a chew although not hard rather than a crunch biscuit with not much flavour. The crust is fatter because of the long slow rise with lots of air pockets, outside has a nice thin crisp bite and inside is soft chewy and light. Tasty! The part with the toppings is thin enough that it was bending under the generous amount of ham.Pastas again more affordable than I expected. Mostly freshly made...that's always something I appreciate! And while the flavours were fresh and the ingredients quite generous, seasoning was well controlled to highlight the taste of the ingredients and not to disguise shortfalls. we didn't get that too salty feeling that is quite common in a lot of Italian places.The squid ink with crab meat is quite a popular dish I was told. It's not what I expected but I will order again. It was surprisingly light compared to a lot of renditions out there with a fresh tomato sauce.We also tried a daily special pasta which was cream based with ham. I wouldn't have picked this coz I didn't want more ham but it was a saltier richer dish. I was eyeing the risotto with porcini or the gnocchi with blue cheese (woo next time!).Then we followed up with the 1kg T-bone steak (my mom wanted steak but we were a bit out of ideas so I asked her to try this place. None of my family had been before but I had). This wasn't as good as when I last had it. I had asked for medium as my mom doesn't like it too bloody but it was more like medium well and a bit dry. The meat that came right off the bone part was so juicy though. I think I'll rather try the lamb dishes the next time and have more pastas and pizzas.Service was very on the ball, not intrusive but responsive. We also went into the wine room to choose our wine. Prices all marked out clearly with many having tasting notes written on a label, was quite a fun experience. We were told to help ourselves..no pressure :)Note they highly recommend this dark chocolate \"cake\" that they buy from Italy..but for the price..13.90 for a tiny little piece. Save your money..go to Royce. Get a box of their powdered signature chocolate (I think around $20) much bigger portion and similar style and you can choose some flavours. We thought the tiramisu was ok only, quite a big piece. We also had the lemon meringue, the meringue texture was very creamy and the lemon is quite tangy so I like that. The pastry was ok, not very special. Definitely a better portion size than the choc thing.Not everything was fantastic but it's a good solid choice for pizzas, pastas and starters. Service is good. Atmosphere is relaxed and prices surprisingly affordable (without wine), I can see myself coming more regularly for dinner. I'm a bit stuck between 4 and 5 but currently stick to 4.",

    "text": "Went there for a birthday celebration, found it to be a quaint little Italian-village looking place (which I guess was what it was going for) with a classy and quiet interior. The service crew treated us friendly, and the wine cellar was nicely done. But that's where the good stuff ends. As the night drew on, more customers started coming in and the tight interior of the restaurant became very evident. Waiters had to constantly squeeze past each other and customers that stood up, and got less helpful and more grumpy as the night went on. Our food took almost a full hour to come from the time we ordered, and when it finally came, the quality wasn't all that good. The right space meant it was extremely difficult and disruptive for any one person to get up and go to the toilet, which was of the same quality as a hawker centre toilet.Then we had our birthday celebration, which required the cake we kept in the fridge earlier to be taken out and served. This took a good 15 minutes. Also, when we wanted to ask a waiter to take a photo for our group, there was none in sight. When he did agree to do so, he took another 5 minutes to get ready. Finally, we tallied the bill, which came up to $70+ per person. In summary, come here only if you're in a group of not more than 4, have a lot of time, and a car. (It's almost impossible to get there by public transport)",

I have heard many good things about Pietrasanta over the year and shall continue to spread its goodness. It holds much authenticity with homemade focaccia bread, cheeses, and pastas. They are all very fresh and simple. I really enjoy the setting and hospitality. Everyone is so friendly and always smiling. The food was without a doubt pleasing. We had the house special mackerel, lasagna and a starter. It was enough to keep us full but we persisted till dessert came. The fish was sweetly grilled and very fresh. It was as if they fish it out from the sea instead of flying it in from Norway. The lasagna is cheesy but yet hold substantial meatiness and well seasoned. A dark chocolate torte with sour cream and biscotti, much like a match made in heaven. I would definitely come back again to try their wine and homemade pastas.",

Overall a great ambiance - family friendly & relaxed :) A watering hole for expats. I've been here a couple of times so I've experienced my fair share of hits and misses. For \"safe\" choices, I'd say stick with the salad, pasta and pizza. They've got those nailed. Everything else is subjective. 1. Grilled squid - Ok2. Seared smoked scamorza wrapped with parma ham - BAD. PASS! Super salty and oily! 3. Garden salad served with cherry tomatoes \u00a0- Love! 4. Portabella mushrooms - All diced up, I could barely make out that it was mushrooms!!! tasted ok but I would have preferred to see my large beautiful Portabella mushrooms intact. 5. Pasta with lobster - Ok6. Coconut sobert - BAD. PASS. Made out of cheap coconut milk that probably came out from a can! It has a grainy taste to it. Hardly from a fresh coconut. 7. Margarita pizza - Good. They do good pizzas so feel free to be adventurous. 8. Mussels in white wine sauce - Ok. 9. Veal shank, potato puree - Good. Soft, tender, juicy! Great thick, savory, rich brown sauce too :) 10. Special house dessert (pastry served with strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice-cream) - Ok :) interesting dessert. 11. Bread - Thin pitta like bread with herbs. Tomato dip on the side. - LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. My vote for favorite dish. It's the simple things in life :) Service - Great",

The saffron and bone marrow risotto was pretty solid, despite being served a little cold. In particular, I am so in love with their home made gnocchi in white wine sauce with crabmeat and semi dry tomatoes. The gnocchi are freshly made, and just the right texture and flavor. The crab meat was generous and the sauce is so garlicy and delicious I just want to lick the whole plate clean. The restaurant is beautiful too, like a tuscany homestyle restaurant. The prices are very reasonable, and the service was prompt and good. I get hungry now just thinking about that gnocchi.",

Despite the menu sounding like a mad overkill, each and every dish is truly authentic and well thought out. My two personal favourites to share are the 1KG T-bone steak and the Neploitana Pizza. The T-bone steak is grilled to perfection according to your request although the chef's recommendation is medium to medium-rare. This main is accompanied with well-seasoned grilled potatoes, tossed beans and a generous bowl of olive-balsamic rocket salad. Perfect for sharing between 2 - 4 people depending on how huge your appetite is. The Nepolitana pizza highlights authentic Italian pizza at its best with a thin layer of mozzarella, anchovy fillets and capers. \u00a0If you're a die-hard Stuffed Crust Pizza Hut fan, this pizza might not be for you. \u00a0Finally if you're a cheese lover, you're in luck. Pietrasanta stocks a huge collection of imported cheeses sure to impress even the most experienced cheese connoisseurs. One final point to note, make your reservations early especially over the weekends. Viva Italia!",
