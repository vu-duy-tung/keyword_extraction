    "text": "Fried Hokkien Mee is my favourite local dish and I've been on a quest to find the best Fried Hokkien Mee in SG for a very long time. The best I had so far (I would give that 5 Yelp stars) was at a coffee shop beside the Aljunied MRT Station more than 20 years ago. I used to visit that stall quite often for a couple of years and really enjoyed the old uncle's fried Hokkien Mee. It was cooked perfectly - just the way I love it. Thereafter, I stopped visiting the coffee shop for a while, and to my dismay, when I visited it again, I found out that the Fried Hokkien Mee uncle has stopped operating at the coffee shop. I tried asking around where he has moved to, but no one seemed to know.So, for the past 20 years, I've been trying many many Fried Hokkien Mee Stalls in SG hoping to find something that is similar to my favourite Fried Hokkien Mee. Sad to say, my pursuit of my favourite dish proved to be futile as I was disappointed again and again, after trying many Fried Hokkien Mee Stalls. Fortunately for me, about 5 years ago, my foodie friends told me about the famous Geylang Lor 29 Fried Hokkien Mee. I went to try it straightaway and liked it a lot. Although, it's still quite different from my all-time favourite, I was happy I found one that I really like.You can imagine how happy I was when my friends told me that the Geylang Lor 29 stall has opened a branch in my hood. So, I can now get my fix for Fried Hokkien Mee whenever I needed it. What's even better is that it's even more convenient now as they do delivery via UberEATS. Just ordered one a few days ago via UberEATS and the food arrived in less than 20 minutes - fresh off the oven and piping hot. If you know of any good Fried Hokkien Mee stalls in SG, do let me know. I'll still like to try more until I find my perfect Fried Hokkien Mee. The search is not over. (Disclaimer: I don't work for UberEATS)",

Over rated I feel and slightly bordering profiteering. Taste wise was not bad and tasted like HM (Hokkien Mee) . Have been eating this dish for 30++ years and know mediocrity when I see it . Portion wise felt like $3.50-$4 (...yes can be found still with just as good a taste)Will go back only when passing and having a HM Pang .",

It's always been consistent and has that awesome Wok Hei flavour or breath of the wok which is an indication of the level of skill of the chef in being able to achieve one of the foundations of a good wok cooked meal.The noodles are always cooked just right and the seafood by way of the juicy prawns and tender squid is also prepared perfectly. Hokkien Mee isn't the only dish they do there either and the Oluak or oyster omelette is beautiful too.If you're ever in Singapore, this is a must see or taste spot on your adventure the food paradise that is Singapore.",

Ask for a little more sambal, and youI could sing its praises a little longer, but you'd spend your time better just going there now.Extra points for also offering carrot cake (okay this needs a mini-rave - again with the crispy edges, again with the prawns {who's got prawns in their carrot cakes nowsadays!?}), AND orh luah too (okay haven't tried this one).More extra points for being two doors down from Penny University - I can see a \"morning coffee leading to lunchtime carrot cake\" routine happening in my future.",

Well, suffice to say that the hokkien mee here is really up to mark. The gravy is very thick and flavorful, and the noodles (which consisted of yellow noodles and thick rice noodles) had just the right texture. The cook was also very generous with the portion of sotong and prawns! \u00a0Taste wise, this is among the best that I have eaten, and the freshness of the ingredients really brings up the quality of the hokkien mee here. This is definitely one of my highly recommended places for good hokkien mee!",

    "text": "A decent plate of hokkien mee is hard to find nowadays with all the masters either retired or left with disciples that cannot do it well. The Hokkien mee over here is well fried with a strong prawn stock that soaks into the noodles and comes with a tasty thick gravy. The noodles don't have the yellow chemical taste unlike most others for some reason and that makes it all the more better. The only way to eat Hokkien mee is with lots of sambal and the sambal here not only tastes great, but comes with great kick to it as well. Seating is rather spacious and not as cramped as you would expect it to be and there are smoking seats available as well, though they're rather near to the dumpsters. Parking is horrendous to be honest, with just 6 lots in a tight area. It's better and safer to just park at the lots located at Telok Kurau instead, a short 1 min walk away.",
