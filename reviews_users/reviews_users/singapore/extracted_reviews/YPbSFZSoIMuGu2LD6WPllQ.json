There were some tables of 4 available too, but you may need to wait a few minutes.Food was served fast, and it's nice to be able to sit down in A/C while waiting for your order. At the original stall, no A/C and you can be standing in line for a loooong time. Here, you can take a seat and wait for your number to be called. Worth the convenience and comfort.Had the soya chicken, rice, veggies, and fried beancurd. All was good.Total price was $22 which is reasonable for the amount of food. Water was $1.80 which is a bit of a rip-off, so bring your own water.",

    "text": "Saw this listed as a Michelin-starred Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice in 2016. \u00a0Was so happy to tried it out on my trip to Singapore in Dec. '16. \u00a0I went to the original store around 1;30pm on a weekday. \u00a0It was closed and was directed by a sign to their new location which started less than a month ago during the end of Nov. \u00a0Many people like me were caught on a surprise, \u00a0Anyway, it was a short stroll from the hawker center to the new location, basically across Smith Street of Chinatown Complex where the hawker center is. \u00a0Wow.... \u00a0the line was long, spend more than an hour to get in just to order. \u00a0And as you can see why a 3 stars? \u00a0Here's the summary....Service - The staffs were very unpleasant, somehow they were all burned out(This new store was opened less than a month ago when I came) or they were way under paid. \u00a0From the staff for maintaining the line to enter the restaurant(Just to enter the restaurant for standing in line to order). \u00a0The staff that guild you ordering via a kiosk and he will not let you touch it. \u00a0I tried to order myself as he was sllloooowwwwwww, his mind is like 20% working and the 80% thinking about something else, not work related I'm sure. \u00a0It's just a koisk, I know how to press on the things I want, there's picture too but he gives me the look. \u00a0Fine, after order and received a pager, attempt to locate a table while waiting for my food to be picked up. \u00a0As I was waiting, I saw the staffs were slow at cleaning the table, they were upset at people who removed used plates and placed on unoccupied tables. \u00a0People were cleaning tables themselves as they were waiting for the food. \u00a0When the pager rang, time to pick up my food and asked the staff for condiments as it was almost empty. \u00a0The ladies just replied 'Ok' and ignored me, I waited for more than 5 mins before someone came to fill. \u00a0I believe the other popular Chicken Rice store in Maxwell Food Center did a better job organizing.Food - The Soya Chicken was good but not to the extend for waiting for more than an hour or to die for. \u00a0I do like the taste but it's a little too sweet for me. \u00a0I don't mind the saltiness. \u00a0The chicken mixed well with either rice or noodle. \u00a0That's the only reason for a 3 starsPrice - Way to high. \u00a0I am not comparing this with a hawker food center prices but a typical food court in a mall. \u00a0For the portion provided with respect to price. \u00a0It's consider very expensive. \u00a0Generally, a plate of chicken rice/noddle comes with about a quarter of a chicken. \u00a0Therefore a chicken can serve 4 plates of chicken rice/noodle but for them, for a chicken they serve 8 plates of chicken rice/noodle. \u00a0You can imagine how little chicken you get. \u00a0For 2-3 person, I will suggest half a chicken to share and not chicken rice/noodle plate. \u00a0You will laugh at the portion for one person.Conclusion - Way overrated. \u00a0If you do visit Singapore, and you have not come here before, I will say do visit this restaurant but do plan according. \u00a0Standing in line for more than an hour is really waste of time. \u00a0Or to die for. \u00a0Do not expect service. \u00a0I believe hawker center do better than them.",

The chicken was very tasty and tender, with the meat falling off the bone. It was truly worth the wait. TIP: OVER ORDER. The servings are small so it would be wise to order a lot. You don't want to regret not having ordered a lot - - because of how good it really tastes, and also because of the long wait. If you can't finish it, it's always good to take home.",

I waited in line for about 30 minutes and ordered a chicken rice and a roasted pork rice which came out to about $4.50 SGD. I thought the place was a bit overhyped and that was partially my fault for reading up about it and watching videos beforehand. The chicken was dry and a bit bland and honestly I felt that the pork was done better. The owner wasn't there the day I went so I could chalk it up to that. Then again it's such a good deal that I'd probably come back if the wait wasn't crazy. There were quite a few popular hawker stalls in the vicinity though, so it'd be hard to justify waiting anything more than 10 minutes when a similar quality meal could be had from another vendor.My tip to any travelers visiting the stall location: bring something to fan yourself with or at least a bottle of water! Like the rest of Singapore, it was hot.",

We arrived at the restaurant at 6pm but was quickly turned away as they were already out of ingredients- bummer!On our way back to the MRT station however, I caught sight of a restaurant where people were forming two lines to dine in. Lo and behold, the sign stated \"Liao Fan- Hawker Chan,\" world's cheapest Michelin star restaurant! Hawker Chan had partnered and expanded his business and created a dine-in restaurant near his original store.Though the queue (two rows) looked intimidating, we decided to wait it out and see what the hype was about. SERVICE:+ Though interaction with the staff is minimal, I found the process self-explanatory and efficient. While waiting in-line, the staff brought us menus so we would know what we wanted to order by the time we got to the cashier. After you place your order and pay, they will give you a buzzer that will vibrate when your food is ready. Then you trade your buzzer for the food that you pick up. +To keep the flow going and meet the demand, the staff were efficient in cleaning-up. They immediately seized the table to clean-up as soon as the party leaves the table. \u00a0 FOOD:+ Simple menu options + VALUE MEAL -- it really lives up to the \"world's cheapest Michelin star restaurant.\" The soya chicken rice was only $3.80! The portion of one meal left me feeling just content. I would recommend ordering side dishes if you want fully satisfy your hunger. + They were out of Char Siew when we ordered around 6:30pm, so we ordered the soya chicken rice and noodle. Both were delicious, though I wished there were more greens in the meal. Atmosphere:+ This is an \"up-scale\" version of an Hawker center: clean and not as noisy as Hawker Centers,Overall, I'm glad that we ran into Liao Fan and tried it out!",

The prices are slightly higher, averaging $4 for a plate since you're paying for the A/C and nicer seating area. Worth it though. No line at all if you go on a weekday around 3-4pm. You get a number for your order and they ring a bell when your number is ready. Pretty tech savvy -- now if only the waitress didn't incessantly press the bell every single time...I still think the charsiu (\u53c9\u70e7) is the best meat of them all. It's lean while still has amazingly browned and caramelized edges. I'd buy a whole piece if they let me! Also if you're really into the meats, would be worth it to try the combo meat platters (charsiu/roast pork for $6 or charsiu/roast pork/chicken combo).I also really liked the rice here and the homemade brown sauce that was poured on top of it. It had a very interesting plummy/sweet/savory flavor that was very complimentary to the meats.",

I was a little confused when my googling brought us to this location that was clearly not a little stall, but instead a newer location opened up after the success of the stall. We weren't sure if we should just eat here, or go find the original stall.A little research brought me the following information (I can't guarantee it is all true since I didn't actually go to the stall):+the food tastes pretty much the same at both places+the food is more expensive in this store+there is a much longer wait at the original stall (and no AC!)After weighing the cost/benefits (the big one being AC), we decided it wasn't worth it to try and find the original stall.So we got in line and ordered:+Soya Sauce Chicken Rice ($3.80): a simple dish, but the chicken was actually really delicious! The meat was tender and full of flavor. The soy sauce flavored rice was also simple, but a good addition.+Pork Rib Noodle ($5.00): the sauce was on the sweeter side, with the option of mixing in the spicy sauce (I didn't). The pork rib was probably my favorite of the pork meats we tried.+2 Combination Platter (Char Siew and Roasted Pork) ($6.00): I wasn't too impressed with the meats as they were both quite dry and not that flavorful.+Seasonal Vegetable ($5.00): pretty basic dish, but helps to keep the meat from being too overwhelming. Nothing amazing, but it was done well.+Roselle Tea ($2.00): this tastes a lot like suan mei tang (not sure of the English name). It is sweet and tart (similar to cranberries maybe?). Im personally not a huge fan.The food was good, and I left feeling satisfied without needing to break the wallet. That being said, is there probably better food out there? Very likely so, but at least you can have bragging rights about eating at a Michelin star restaurant! I would definitely recommend trying it at least once if you're in the Chinatown area.",

    "text": "I would have regretted it if I left Singapore without coming, but I definitely can't see myself recommending it to anyone with the hot long wait and mediocre food. Maybe I got very unlucky thoughFood: I ordered the basic rice and chicken combo, added some roast pork and a flower tea for S$7.80 total.Soy sauce chicken was more of a sweet style and lacked any real depth of soy sauce flavor or savoriness. You could tell than there were aromatics in the braising liquid like orange peel. The chicken was tender but almost to a gelatinous, slippery feel and the chicken flavor was masked significantly by the sweetness of the sauce. The hot sauce is also quite sweet and not really worth using.Roast pork was cut into nice small pieces and had a fairly good ratio of lean meat, to juicy meat, to crackling did lack a bit of crispness- it was a bit more of a stale crunch, but still decent.The sauce on the chicken isn't just regular soy but you can taste the seasonings from the braising process which is nice.The tea has too much sugar and not enough flower- would not recommend.Service/Experience:Staff is woefully unprepared which is why everything is so slow. The kitchen is actually very fast and all the food is ready to go but the actual point of sale system seems to be flawed and this is why the wait is so damn long. One cashier started taking my order but was abruptly stopped by someone else. One of the cashiers doubles to clean the dining room and let in the next batch of customers. I recommend coming back in a few months when hopefully the service improves.",

The Soya Sauce Chicken was all bone, skin and fat, with very little meat. The only things I found decent were the condiments and the soy sauce drippings on the bottom of the plate. I tried to grasp the greatness this dish was known for, and it fell flat for me.Though, it was amusing to witness the tourists there instagramming and raving about the glorified dish. Sheep will be sheep, I suppose.I quickly got out of there to hail a taxi, and the driver laughed when I told him about my experience at Hawker Chan. He responded \"Even place upstairs have better food!\" and I believe it.",

I guess my first mistake was expecting proper chicken rice, whereas this place serves something more akin to white rice with a stingy pour of soy sauce over it. The chicken was also lackluster--while the top (skin & fat) layer melts in your mouth, it was nothing to write home about. Furthermore, the long lines/waits and jam-packed crowds with little room to maneuver and most importantly the STINK permeating the restaurant ensured that I will not be returning to this place. My friends and I regretted not chancing upon the open air hawker stall area nearby (further down Smith St.) at which we'd have gladly eaten instead.",

We ordered a whole chicken, rice and three meats (Char siew and siew yok). The ordering system is pretty efficient. There is a kiosk where one can order and pay by credit card OR you can order old-school at the counter. After ordering, they hand you a receipt with a number and when you see your number on the screen, your order is ready to be picked up. The chicken was good - tender and flavorful, but nothing mind-blowing. The char siew was okay - could have done without. Overall, it was good cheap food, but nothing too memorable.",

    "text": "I'll admit that the only reason I checked this place out was out of curiosity, this place has had a certain amount of hype recently. First of all this is a new location in a nice and clean restaurant which takes away from the street hawker experience, but is probably more sanitary so I can't complain. I got what everyone recommended which was the soya chicken with noodles. You can order at the kiosk or order at the counter and they will give you a number. They have various drinks available and Tiger beer which was really up charged. The noodles were slightly cold but the chicken was warm so it wasn't an issue, however they are a bit stingy with the vegetables. The house made sambal sauce is yummy and so are the picked chilies, their condiment game is on point. My total was $4.80 which is slightly pricey for a \"hawker stall\" but you get extras such as air conditioning and food safety so it's worth it. I noticed there were a lot of foreigners here, more so than locals which concerned me but I think it was just my timing. I enjoyed my meal and while it wasn't the best thing I ate in Singapore it certainly is deserving of its Michelin star.",

But I really appreciate some of the most down-to-earth restaurants that have gotten a Michelin star. For example, I gladly went to one in Hong-Kong. And in Singapore this Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle spot is sorely unassuming, but it must be doing something right to receive that star. The reviews are so mixed, it bewildered me. There are a lot of folks who like it and many who do not and call it overhyped. I ordered, I felt like, the signature dish on the menu. Yes, surely the classic soy sauce chicken. That's their claim to fame dish and they would sell this dish at their first stall for 2 SG dollar a plate. Later they raised the price to SG$3.80, but the extra cost goes into the overhead like the air conditioning, nice seating, etc. So essentially it's still a SG$2 Michelin star meal. The chicken looked beautiful, the colour looked \u00a0right, there was a bunch of sauce in the rice itself along with some soy beans. The rice was fluffy and tasty, the sauce's taste was uniquely sweet and much deeper than just mere soy sauce. As for the chicken, it's highly tender white meat, neither dry nor juicy. All in all, worth it notwithstanding long lines!",

    "text": "This review is for the actual Liao Fan Hong Kong food stall (now known as Hawker Chan) instead of the Hawker Chan restaurant which opened after the Michelin Star was earned. Yelp is a bit confusing in that reviewers are posting reviews for both locations on multiple businesses which all have different addresses. The food stall is located on the second floor of the Chinatown Complex, which is across the street from the air conditioned sit-down restaurant. The reason I chose to eat at the stall is because the prices are cheaper and the food is \"supposedly\" better. Also, if I'm going to come all the way here - it's better to eat at the original right? (Especially since Hawker Chain restaurant chains are now popping up all over the world). The soya sauce chicken noodle is the dish that earned this place a Michelin Star. At the stall it is S$2.50 (super cheap for a Michelin Star meal!) I also ordered a char siew rice which was also $2.50. There are some other menu items that also looked delicious like the soya sauce chicken rice, roasted pork rice, and the chicken hor fun. Most dishes are S$3 and under. Let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The noodles were cooked well. I love that they poured their delicious sauces all over my plate. Was it amazing? I'm not sure. There are a lot of other stalls in the area serving the same exact dish and most of them are also really delicious. I'm not sure what makes the chicken stand out. The char siew, however, was really good - I liked it more than the chicken.Overall, I think my expectations were too high because of this place's popularity and its star. The only reason we came here was to try the \"cheapest Michelin Star meal in the world\". I'm not sure if I would come here again and wait in the really long line. Comparing this place to other one Michelin Star restaurants I would give it a four star (good food at a very cheap price). Comparing this place to other Hawker stalls I would give it a five star.",

    "text": "It's now called Hawker Chan (per the sign, \"Formerly known as Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle\"). You won't find a cheaper Michelin-rated eating establishment anywhere in the world. For the famous See Yao Gai Fan (soy sauce chicken rice), it's S$2. With the current exchange rate, that's about $1.50 USD- it's pretty much free then. The chicken itself is fantastic- definitely higher quality than what your typical HK BBQ shop would offer. The chicken here is plump and succulent with gushing taste. Another thing, I'm surprised that no one talks about the char siew. This breaks into my personal top 3 char siew experiences. It's got a perfect balance between meat, fat, oiliness, marinate, and sweetness- it just melts inside your mouth and the outside has a good burnt char appeal. If you get the chicken rice, I strongly recommend the char siew as a side. They actually open at 10am, and regardless of the day of the week, there's going to be a long line. The original location, where you can see the owner, is found in the Chinatown Complex Food Court. There's another Hawker Chan restaurant set-up outside on Smith Street, which for some reason, has the same offerings but at a premium. Not sure what that's all about, but your best bet is to just go to the actual original hawker in the food court. Anyways, for what you're paying and what you get, this place is great! Man man sik.Oh, and one more thing.. the owner is actually not a Singaporean. He's Malaysian from Ipoh.",

You pay a little more for the convenience of having air conditioning and service. They have a kiosk where you can tap on the menu, order and pay with a credit card so you can skip the line. However, that kiosk is located towards the front of the line (LOL).They've been getting lots of customers - mostly tourists because of their Michelin fame. So, if chaos and waiting in line isn't your thing, you shouldn't even be in Singapore!To the foreigners that complain about \"the Chicken was all bones\" - welcome to Asia where chickens aren't on steroids and growth hormones. This is what normal chickens are like. You shouldn't even be in Singapore!For about 5.50SGD, you get your protein (chicken, char siew, roasted pork or ribs) + carbs (rice or noodles) + soya. You can also add more protein for about 2.50SGD. Or be an oinker like me and pay 10.50SGD for the 3-meat combo with a carb.I've eaten here and at Hawker Chan several times while I was in Singapore. I've tried their soya sauce chicken, char siew, roasted pork, rice, and noodles. They're all good but the menu item that I always get was the roasted pork. It's meaty, not super fatty, and the skin is crunchy good. The chicken is flavorful and tender.Pay attention to your ticket number so you're not that clueless tourist slowing down the process and harassing the employees when your food is going to be ready. In the dining area, there's a TV where you can watch Chan Hon Meng's Michelin story and on the side is the ticket number they're serving.They actually open at 10am not 11am as the Yelp listing says. I always get here as soon as they open to avoid the big crowd.",

So tender and flavorful, and the rice had some type of soy sauce something on top which made it even more delightful. When you order it says \"pax\", and I was holding up the line on the kiosk so had to google what that meant and it means the number of people. I don't know where that originated from but glad I know now.This place deserves the Michelin star award for how awesome the food tasted. Can't wait to go back when in Singapore.",

This is my favorite part of the meal; the sauce is sweet, tangy not too spicy! It contains a lot of flavour without coming off as too strong or too rich. The rice is drizzled with a mysterious black sauce with a sweet aftertaste, I normally don't eat rice but by the end of the meal, I had devoured most of it!Definitely recommend this place, the pricing is reasonable for the portion size.",

The soya chicken was delicious - tender, flavorful, and cheap. The roast pork was also delicious and only $2. Everything else was meh. As much as I liked the soya chicken, I think it was only worth the experience. I wouldn't do it again and wouldn't recommend anyone doing it just to try the \"michelin chicken\".

Soya chicken from my hometown is so... dry that I would never order it, so my thought was how can chicken get better.. especially to the point that it deserves a star.If you want the full-on experience, you must go to the original hawker stand on the 2nd floor of the building across the street, but it usually has a longer line and opens later than the new chain restaurant opened on Smith Street. Also, if you are price conscious while on vacation, the stand is cheaper: - Soya Chicken DishAt Stand - $2.50At Franchise - $3.80- Half a ChickenAt Stand - $7At Franchise - $12We tried both places and think the food is pretty comparable. The franchise is more to make money from tourists for the investment firm that approached the chef (I believe the chef gets 30% of profits or 30% share of the business). You can get angry at the price difference, but you got to give the man props. Now, he'll actually make money for about the same amount of work. My group also tried several of the Soya chicken stands in the area, and they do not compare. For me, its all in the texture and flavor. The chicken is tender while succulent and reminds me of roast duck, but with the heavy flavor of soy sauce. Delicious!I'd definitely recommend the trying either location. But this one has A/C for all you tourists out there like me!",

First off, there's a lot of little bone splinters in the chicken. I understand that's part of certain chicken rice recipes, but not as enjoyable for me when I'm constantly picking bones out of my mouth while trying to eat. More importantly than the bones, though, is the fact that the chicken was literally cold when I got my plate. I don't know if this is part of their recipe, but I thought it was kind of gross to eat. Chicken rice should be HOT. Serving size was good, and you'll get to say you've eaten the \"cheapest Michelin Star meal in the world\", but I can honestly attest to the fact that the chicken rice here is just not that good.",

    "text": "I am surprised this doesn't have a review yet. This is the first restaurant of recently rewarded Chef Chan who is a Michelin starred chef! His hawker stand which is rated \"cheapest Michelin starred food in the world\" is not far front this restaurant. See Yelp link here:yelp.com/biz/hong-kong-s\u2026 We chose to try this restaurant as it just opened Nov 2016, and I've got to say that the soy sauce chicken is superb. It is nice that it is air conditioned as well. We got there and the queue was not that long outside but when we left it snaked around and was on the street out of the queue barriers. There is a queue outside the door, and they let you in in bunches so you don't overwhelm the kitchen and ordering. You either order at the counter register or get helped by someone at the ordering machine as well. Both seems effective and decently orderly. You order, pay, get a number, then, grab your seat. Your number gets called and you pick up your order. Utensils, hot sauce, straws, chilis, are self service too. The neat thing is Chef Chan was there putting out the food from the kitchen too. There is a variety of menu combinations or alacarte you can choose from but basically soy sauce chicken, char siew (BBQ pork), roast pork, roast pork ribs. Then there is rice, wonton noodles, hor fun (wide flat rice noodles). \u00a0Then veggies and drinks. We ordered a full chicken (S$23), 2 combination meat of char siew and roast pork (S$6), rice (.8) and wonton noodles (1.5), and two drinks. We basically had leftover chicken and a few pieces of the others but we knew that'd happen. Overall, as expected, soy sauce chicken their specialty, was by far the best. One of the best soy sauce chickens I've ever had. Weakest was the roast pork in my opinion but still good. Because of the air conditioning, the wonton noodles (which are served dry with the soy sauce chicken sauceon it) didn't stay as warm as I'd like but still was good. The rice with the sauce was good with the chicken too. I'd recommend stopping by and queuing for this whether it be the restaurant or hawker if you're in Singapore. Given that it's S$3.80 (around $2.50 usd) It is super affordable and yummy. FYI/ hawker stall info is in the link above and very near the restaurant is: Hawker Stall: Blk 335, Smith Street #02-126, Chinatown Food Complex, Singapore 050335Opening Hours: 10:30am to 7:00pm (Mon - Tues, Thurs - Fri), 8:30am to 7:00pm (Sat - Sun), Closed WedTip/ cash, credit, nets which is great for versatility of payment Tip2/ must try the soy sauce chicken Tip3/ very near the Chinatown MRT (purple North-east line) I believe exit A toward smith street is the proper exit.",
