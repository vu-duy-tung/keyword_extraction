    "text": "Was expecting an out-of-this-world experience especially with the traditional shrimp dumplings, \u00a0xiao long baos, egg tarts (which are a must have at every dim sum for me) and chee cheong fun, but what surprised me most was their egg fried rice and fish porridge which blew me away. Something as plain as eggs with fried rice? Fish and porridge? They nailed it. Their dim sum tasted average though. Nothing much to rave about but of acceptable standard.Total bill amounted to almost $100 for 2 pax, because we ordered way too much dim sum.Will definitely recommend this place if you're looking to indulge in good food, but I won't return again because of it's hefty pricing.",

Everything is served in portions designed for 2 people or 3-4 or 5-7. So just ordering separately isn't an option. The salted egg custard buns had a gritty texture to the custard. Pass on those! The chicken rice was delicious. Service was off. We ordered dim sum to start and had to ask for soy. Then we received a wee ramekin that wasn't big enough to share. No chili oil. We also had to ask for chopsticks and silverware. I wouldn't return.",

    "text": "This is a 2.5 for me. Much as I am a fan of Chef Pang's flagship Majestic restaurant at Bukit Pasoh, his newest restaurant fell short for me.To be fair, the items that fell short are the dimsum items. We took the set menu which included 5 dimsums and they all range from not good to average. The other few items we picked from the ala carte dimsum menu were not much better either. None of the dimsum items were good.Apart from the 5 dimsum items, the $28 per person menu also included a soup of the day, a veggie, coffee pork belly, lobster bee hoon, mochi dessert.The soup was amazing. Classic Cantonese double-boiled soup. We were informed that it was in the pot for 6 hours and you can tell. Thick and sweet and savory, exactly how a good double-boiled soup should be.The famed lobster bee hoon is great. For a portion for 4 pax, I think we get the whole lobster though not a big one. The bee hoon is nicely simmered in the lobster broth and it still retains the al dente bite. Yumz.The coffee pork belly was a disaster. I couldn't eat it. Though the menu says it is pork ribs, our entire plate was pork belly coated in this weird tasting coffee rub.We started with a geoduck done two ways - sashimi and steamboat. It was as amazing as how a fresh geoduck should taste. The broth that came with the steamboat was also really flavorful and you can taste that it is from a really superior stock.If I do return, I would probably stick to the ala carte menu and maybe the seafood items. But for a better experience, I would rather go back to his flagship restaurant.",

    "text": "For pictures and full reviews, visit my blog!The Majestic Group is pretty well known in the Singapore food scene. Following the success of Majestic Restaurant and Jing, Chef Yong Bing Ngen, best known for his contemporary Chinese cuisine, has ventured into the seafood restaurant market with his latest Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant. Expect some innovative seafood creations at this family friendly restaurant, which is quite a depart from the fine dining experience at the sister establishments.Located below the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, the spacious 110-seater restaurant is brightly lit by the natural light that streams in through the glass panels. \u00a0To kick off dinner, we had the Duo Seafood Combo, \u00a0($28 for 4 person portion). Crispy lychee, crab meat, mushrooms; soft shell crabs, lemon butter milk sauce. I much preferred the former, which was an interesting savory and sweet combination. The lychee is also a great tenderizer and i loved how the moist center complemented the airy and buttery crust. The crabs were missing a little of that crustacean taste, probably due to the over seasoning with the sauce and thick batter.A good gauge of a Cantonese restaurant is by the quality of its soups and Majestic is fabulous that way. The Braised, Ocean Sunfish maw, crab meat, luffa, thicken yellow soup ($18/portion), , was very flavorful. The golden superior broth is made from a duck and chicken stock, blended with carrot and pumpkin and boiled for 6 hours! High quality strips of fresh fish maw and chunks of crab meat are used here. Flawless skin come to me now!Highlight of the night and undoubtedly the favorite dish. The Steamed Bamboo Clam, , (Market Price) was simply divine. The seasoning was really quite simple, leaving the focus on the succulent and crunchy bamboo clams. I love how the glass noodles (tang hoon) soaks up the garlic sauce that was flavored with the essence of the shellfish. Give me seconds anytime.This is the signature \"Kopi\" Crab, , that has tourists making a beeline to Gardens by the Bay. The Sri Lankan crab is cooked with a special sauce made from a blend of 3 different varieties of coffee beans. Marmalade and orange juice is also used in the sauce.The crab was flamb\u00e9ed at the table with a mixture of rice wine, coffee liqueur and coffee beans to give it that caramel crust. And truth be told, it tasted more like caramel popcorn than coffee. If you like sweet stuff, you may like this crab. As for me, i still prefer the savory ones.The Seafood Baked Rice, , ($68 for 4-6 persons, $88 for 7-12 persons) was spectacular when presented. This is one massive pan of rice piled generously with baby abalones, scallops, mussels and prawns, as well as mushrooms (not the chinese sort). The flavor of the sauce is a mix of Portuguese and Japanese Curry, lightly spiced and savory. Save a little space for desserts. If you like variety, the Sweet's temptation, , ($20 for 4 persons) is the way to go. The dessert platter includes 4 different desserts which i felt was very reasonably priced. Start with the lightest tasting Mochi stuffed with fresh cream, chopped mangoes and strawberries, each bite is like biting into a cloud, all fluffy and dreamy. Definitely another favorite of mine.While i love salted egg yolk steamed buns, the ones at Majestic failed to impress me. Too little filling and it was lacking in the salted egg yolk richness and taste. Overall, it was a pleasing meal at Majestic Bay Restaurant. While i may not be back for the signature dishes like the Kopi Crab, i'd certainly make an effort to check out their lunch time dim sum. For $28/pax on weekdays and $33/pax on weekends (min 4 pax), it's value for money for a 6 course meal with 3 mains included!",
