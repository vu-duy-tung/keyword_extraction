Just a heads up, it may be quite out of the way, but I think there are a few buses that go there. The space was really clean, big & bright; something I really appreciate in cafes mainly because I don't like \u00a0small spaces. We tried almost everything on the menu; would definitely recommend the soft shell crab burger (light and crispy!), crab roll (loveeeed the croissant; was super generous with the crab meat as well), and the pulled pork Benedict (my mum polished off her plate!)Their unicorn cake (coconut & mango) is a MUST have, and it's definitely one of my favorite cakes this year. It was really light and tangy. Would definitely come back !",

Once a while having lunch, breakfast or tea here is good ^^ Happy! Down side is this location isn't easy accessible if you doesn't have a car.",

    "text": "Be careful you don't get the name of this place mixed up with an actual \"buffet\" because it's Boufe, not Buffet. Had a nice brunch at this quaint place in the midst of an office campus. It was a good 10 minutes, unshaded walk from Tanglin Road into a mixed use campus. So on a hot day, that air con is gonna feel extra nice when you step into the cool dining room. There is also outdoor seating in the back but it looked like stuff was being stored there when I took a peek.The food was nicely presented but more importantly, it was very tasty and exceeded my expectations after having some disappointing brunches lately. The food quality was very fresh and appealing. Highlights were the fluffy scrambled eggs and the sweet cherry tomatoes served slightly grilled and still the vine. Service was good and prompt, but oddly the coffee ordered arrived halfway through the meal. The server did apologize for the delay and said it was \"due to the coffee being recalibrating\" ... I'm not sure what that meant, but it's quite possible I heard incorrectly. Nevertheless, great flat white. There's a little boutique shop in-house selling jewelry, clothing, and accessories that's worth a browse. Didn't get to try the selection of desserts, but the server did offer. It's going to have to be a rain check because there was just no more belly room.",

    "text": "Previously I had a flat white, a lychee tea and truffle fries. Coffee was straightforward no complaints. Lychee tea was refreshing. Truffle fries served hot but not enough truffle. Some of the staff are young and inexperienced but quite eager to please which makes up for a lot.My 3rd time to this place. Friend's bday impromptu brunch. We were seated on the verandah out at the back and it was a warm day but we felt cool enough and it was nice to have the greenery. The odd ant but hey when in jungle, swing from tree.Bday girl Emma J and I got to the scene first. We ordered the truffled mushroom on house baked baguette and french toast to share. Mushrooms were great with creamy rich sauce, lots of truffle flavour and scent and the baguette looked homemade and was chewy, tasty with a darker brown crust than usual. This looked so good that our late-comer friends all picked from it.French toast - served with some kinda caramel sauce and chantilly cream. The cream held itself together well despite the hot day. The toast was a thick cut of brioche, I think about 5 inch square. The rest of us dipped the fries in the caramel sauce but Emma J was horrified. We all liked this.Truffle fries. Not much on the truffle flavour again but a generous portion served piping hot and crisp.Friend ordered the big breakfast - all commented that the croissant was much smaller than expected. It really was a mini croissant. But the brek came with 2 big juicy sausages. Perhaps they are going low carb...Personally prefer if this came with a good sized piece of toast. Eggs were nicely cooked, soft layered and seasoned just right.Breakfast mains mostly $19 to $21. We all commented that the food was tasty and seemed like quality ingredients. Pleasing and with some nice bits but I wouldn't travel far for it.We also ordered chicken wings to share - these came in a sauce that one friend described as zingy. Served hot, crispy - the sauce was bit spicy. Comfort food but yummier if you dip.Foam on my flatwhite was a little flat with some big bubbles so it didn't have that velvety smoothness that some of the serious boys and girls serve up. I think coffee for is me is a 3 or 3.5. But yes the free parking, breezy white look, bit off the beaten track and so near where I stay. If i need a quick cuppa, I would come..clearly I did.They serve a lemon meringue tart which I've had on my first visit but found it a tad sweet. Ok crust.",

    "text": "The truffle avocado and poached egg was so rich, maybe too rich for me! Doesn't mean it was bad though. I am a notoriously small eater and I can't eat super rich foods fully, so this was too much for me. Their iced lattes are perfect though. Not too sweet or bitter for non coffee aficionados like myself. Also it should be noted that the truffle avocado and poached egg dish has a truffle mushroom ragout. Which translates to SHIT LOAD OF MUSHROOMS in english. So if you're like me and find that mushrooms don't digest well, or at all, maybe get something else as the mushrooms are like a good one third of the dish. All in all, it's a very cute place and they don't try to kick you out when you're done eating. Which is fabulous.",

I had a big breakfast and an iced mint tea of sorts. I do give them credit for their perfect scrambled eggs. Oh, and I got bitten by a few mozzies while seated at their outdoor area, which wasn't too hot as they had sufficient fans.",
