On the way, my driver started telling me the differences between the peppery BKT (Singaporean style) vs. the herbal kind (Malaysian kind), his favorite BKT places in Malaysia and Singapore, other BKT places to try in Singapore, etc. \u00a0When we got to the food complex, he said the place didn't look open so he was going to wait. Not only did he wait, he actually got down to make sure I found the place. Verdict -- awesome. \u00a0I ordered the spare rib and pork rib soup (#1 and #2). The broth was clean tasting and peppery -- just like I imagined it would be given Mark Wien's YouTube video on the same -- youtu.be/xjYqUZ96HYs. As in the video, the servers came around to top up your broth (if you need it). I am a fan although my driver did order me to try out other venues in Singapore :)",

    "text": "I visited this place on a weekday lunch. It was packed with people and you can really see bones littered on the tables that people just left off with. We ordered happily as there were no price on the menu - fried fritters, rice, pig's trotter (lean meat), watercress soup and spare pork ribs soup (lean meat). I like that they have the option of lean and fat meat on their menu.Later on, the fried fritters came and I find its one of the worst fried fritters in bah kut teh stall that I came across. It was floury and there wasn't any kind of crisp to it at all. The rice came later and it was a little soggy for my liking. Two downs for meWhat I do like is its watecress soup, pig's trotters and pork ribs. Watercress soup gives a small bowl of generous watercress inside (can you notice the oxymoron?). $4The pig's trotter is $7 for a small bowl of a few pieces of lean meat. It tastes good and the sauce works well with the meat. Spare ribs soup is a small bowl of only 3 small meagre ribs ($8). The bite-feel is real good, tastes great with the chilli + dark soya sauce, and the soup is peppery-delicious.I seriously expected more at the end of it. Maybe cause I was a guy and they gave me girls' portions for the spare ribs which left me like... is that all?? Furthermore I ordered other sides and still feel dissatisfied. This place has great tasting food but its a little expensive for bah kut teh and the place is quite warm, so it wasn't a very good experience. There are seriously better and more worthwhile bah kut teh in my opinion but if you are really pining for the soup on a warm summers' day, you can try...",

PRICE: AFFORDABLEThe prices here are not cheap cheap but i think its worth it! For today's meal it was about $55-$60 for 4 people! DOUGH FRITTERS $2 MEE SUA $2 PORK SLICES $7 UNLIMITED SOUP REFILLS I am not so sure of the others that we ordered because i only eat these 3 dishes all the time HAHA but my family did order other dishes as seen in the photos! FOOD: GREAT Today's soup (ate at 10am) was slightly less flavorful as compared to the other times i came here maybe because it was still early but definitely still good, \u00a0nice & hot. I always order their mee sua instead of rice because its always very nice & tasteful! The pork slices are always given in great proportions which is quite expected for $7 but it is on the saltier side so some might think its a little too salty even for me (&& i LOVE salty food) but its reallt nice and tender! The dough fritters are also good good BUT their dough fritters are NOT the crispy type so just a warning to those out there!! OVERALL: LOVE ITI'm always excited to eat here because i love Bak Kut Teh so its always a pleasanr experience to eat here & i always eat till my heart's content so if you want some good hearty soup with spice here is the place to go!",

    "text": "I was recommended by a friend about Ah Hua Bah Kut Teh being one of the best in Singapore. But to be honest, this place is extremely hard to find for tourist like me! I literally spent one whole hour after I got off the subway with my friend before finally reaching the destination, and after getting wrongly directed by most of the shopping mall security guards I asked too! Okay enough complaints, it's located in a semi-open style market right next to/underneath a freeway overpass.However, the quality of food did not disappoint and eased my frustration of getting lost.-) Bak Ku Teh: It had a strong white pepper taste (which actually relieved my sickness too as I was having a cold) and the pork inside wasn't too dry at all. Some Bak Ku Teh's white pepper taste (spicy?) is too strong that it covers the original intended bak ku teh taste but Ah Hua's was made at a well-controlled level -) Seaweed soup: Another soup I recommended trying. A lot of seaweed ended up making this soup super refreshing.Tried other snacks/appetizers too, they were all pretty decent. I fell in love with bak ku teh after my visit to Singapore, and Ah Hua definitely tops my list on the white pepper based category.",

Ah Hua is the second (or is it third?) generation running the bak kut teh stall, and they are a close competitor to Ng Ah Sio BKT (at Rangoon road, before it was sold to Jumbo). When I grew up, I started frequenting Ah Hua BKT at Outram Park before/ after Zouk sessions. What better way to sober up than with hot peppery bkt soup and chinese tea? Definitely a way better choice than oily prata. When I grew even older, I would go to the Keppel branch, simply because it was near NUS. Service here is prompt, and the waiters come around to refill your soup ever so often. The menu is extensive, not just pork rib soup but also marinated items and a large selection of vegetables. The taste has definitely changed over the years though. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I'm going to say that the bkt here is good, but not as good as the old days. Still, it is worth the try if you're looking for authentic Singapore-style \"peppery\" bak kut teh. Definitely go for the ribs, and give the innards/ organs a try if you dare. My personal favorite is the kidney and liver, as well as the marinated intestines. The salted vegetable is also a must order for me to go with rice :)",

The soup is consistently peppery and flavorful unlike that other one by Zouk. For those who don't eat pork, they have fish soup! It's cooked in the same broth so it's equally delicious. But that does kind of defeat the purpose, huh? If you do decide to go for the pork, order the ribs; def. worth the extra few bucks! You're immediately served fried fritters so send them back if you don't eat fried food. Oh! They also charge for wet napkins, but dry napkins are unlimited and free.I usually come and drink about 3-5 bowls of that unlimited, delicious soup...def. getting my money worth!",

The other reason for no top score is because the bill can be a little too steep for daily makan fare. Back to the food. I love their sliced pork loin meat. I know it's meant to be Bak Kut but they make their pork loin really soft and tasty! And another fav of mine is the fish slice. Again I know it's madness to order fish at a BKT place but it's nice lah! My dad loves this place and all the Bak Kut stuff so it's not just silly me with the pork slice and fish slice ok? Oh I also love how the soup is endless top-up goodness!!Do come and check it out for yourself.",

It's a short walk away from PSA, which means many staff there often need to battle heaty digestive systems for sure! The soup is definitely not as thick as some, but all the better since it means we can down more in a seating without feeling too sick of the taste. It's also heavily seasoned with pepper, making it a tad spicier than some other soups, so do drink lots of water if you can't deal with the peppery overload. My favourite accompanying dish is the Stuffed Pig Intestines, which sounds disturbing, but is actually a yummy dish from my childhood. It's called Zhu Chang Fen, and has a powdery and paste-y texture after biting into the chewy intestines. It's open till late, so it's a perfect spot for supper with colleagues and la kopi into the wee hours!",

    "text": "We ordered 2 bowls of pork ribs and 1 bowl of pork legs and you tiao. The soup is delicious and tasty and you get unlimited top-up. The Pork with its fats tasted chewy and nice. However the youtiao wasn't crispy and lacked the taste with the soup. Tastes better youtiao elsewhere. There's no prices on the ordering menu and the server had no idea how much those items cost as well. In the end, the bill came up to $24 which is expensive compared to what you get elsewhere at this type of ambience. Food is great but not the price.",

A nice warm pepper soup for the night especially on rainy or chilly day. The soup here is not too peppery. \u00a0Usually, the dishes we would order would be the braised pork trotter, bak ku teh, kidney soup and the salted vegetable. The food is pretty good and I love to wash my meal down with a cup of luo han longan drink.",
