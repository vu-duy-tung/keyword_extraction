    "text": "This is, right now, one of the best burgers I've had in Singapore. I say \"one of the best\" not because I've found a better burger but that it's not a burger for everyone. The buns were ridiculously soft like a baby's bum. The beef pattie was rich, dripping juicy and cooked exactly medium rare like I asked. While I was chomping it down, I exclaimed that the cows they killed must have been happy cows, because I can taste it. I'm guessing these beauties were not fed GM corn or soy and allowed to roam. Cheese was a standard American, coupled with crisp lettuce and tomato slice. After finishing my shared burger, I wanted another one. The sweet 'taters were excellent too. None of that Skinny pizza/House dried fries crap. These were real good, thick, soft fries, crisp on the outside and dressed with cinnamon and some salt.So what's not to like? Well, if you're more of an East Coast 5 Guys kind of person, you may like tougher buns with sesame seeds on them. You may also like a heartier sized pattie with more crispy edges (my burger could've been softer due to the medium rare requiremetn). You may also have a financially induced heart attack from paying $13.90 for a burger that doesn't come with fries (word). I tried repeatedly to reason in my head that paying $13.90 for a good burger wasn't so bad considering the cost of living, rent (boy could they move some else? Turf City really?), general expensiveness of importing produce... but it still hurt. So there. This is good food. Very good food. But it may not be for everyone, like one man's chai dao kuay is another man's beef.",

I can sense where they want to go with the burger when I take the first bite, but I lose focus by the second. Not sure if the beef we get here can pull off this style of burger.I've been three times, I've wanted to love it but ultimately I can't. Thankfully for them they seem to have lots of fans, quite a few of my friends are, but I hope the rave reviews do not stop them from evolving the core product!The name also leaves one with a feeling of embarrassment for them after you realise that there is nothing omakase about it.I'd still join friends for a meal here if they insisted on it.",

    "text": "A great burger, based on taste. Very beefy with a secret blend of different cuts of meat. Hsinyao the owner was an ex-classmate of mine, and he tells me he went through many cuts of beef in various proportions to come to the right combination - he said he's even tried 200 combinations! That's crazy dedication, and it shows in the burger. It's beefy, with a good charred flavour, and extremely juicy so much so that the juices were just spilling out, literally. I wasn't a fan of the bun since it really got quite soggy (but it's very soft nonetheless).The lemonade was good as well - not really that much a fan of the sweet potato fries. Overall the only grouse save the bun was how pricey it was. So far the best Shake Shack imitation in Singapore. Hands down.I came back just shortly after - to have the Deluxe Cheeseburger that came with onions and mushrooms and i must say i really enjoyed this one - it was mighty delicious especially with the onions and the mushrooms. Delish. Good stuff and the beef was good as well.The truffle fries were very nice too.Updated to 5 stars.",

    "text": "The good: Strictly based on taste, best burger I've had in Singapore. I ordered the burger of the month, and it transported me back home to some of my favorite burger joints of all time. Thin, juicy and crispy patties, plus a bun that compliments. The only reason this spot is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is all the other elements surrounding the burger. The space is pleasant and spacious, long cafeteria style tables, which is good for large groups and single dwellers like myself. \u00a0I also like the family feel, father was on the register, mom and son in the kitchen. Love that. They also have American ketchup and a container of pickles. Yes, ketchup makes a difference. \u00a0The bad: Microbrew. It nearly ruined the burger for me. I'm all for supporting local businesses, but this \"golden ale\" tasted like sprite and bud light mixed together. Barely drinkable. When I return I'll try the Japanese micro-brews. The ugly: Location, it's Turf Club area, so basically you're driving or walking a sweaty 8-10 minutes from the bus stop. \u00a0It's brand new so expect some not so perfect elements in terms of flow, that being said I got my burger in less than 10 minutes. Finally, the price. Extremely reasonable by Singapore standards (and cheaper than most) but still 3 bucks too expensive for most items (standard burger around $13, special burgers around $17). If they came down on price, I wouldn't hesitate a 5 star rating and weekly visits.",

It was missing that charred smokiness feel that's crucial to any hamburger. It also resulted in my meat being too juicy, letting out too much jus that made the bread soggy. I will definitely give the burger another try though.My friend ordered their chicken chop burger; he let me tried a bite and it was awesome. I'm definitely ordering that, and their baked Parmesan chicken on my next visit.The side dishes were awesome. We ordered the truffle fries, cheese fries & onion rings. Their fries are one of the best around. Crispy on the outside, yet moist/creamy on the inside.All in all, this place is quite a gem and I will definitely revisit it.",

    "text": "First off, if you are looking for a Mcdonalds/Burger King/Carl Jr kind of food, this is not a place for you. And do not compare this to a fast food outlet. Because not only you will be disappointed, your review will create a lot of misunderstanding to those who want to try this place. It is very pricey yes. Just had 2 sets, and cost me $50+. Not exactly a place you would want to visit every day for burger. Surprisingly, the bread is the one thing on your tray that will please you. It's soft, not crumbly, and has butter spread on both of the inside of the breads. It just taste so good, even better than the bread of wagyu burger I had in dB Bistro Moderne at Marina Bay Sands.I had the bacon cheeseburger. The bacon was fried to crisp, the way most people liked it. Some like it soggy though; I like it this way, because it complements the softness of the beef patty, which was cooked medium well. If you are not a burger person, you will find the beef patty to taste somewhat the same as any other burgers. If you are that person who has the need to get your taste buds on a burger that has the closest taste to the In-N-Out burger (yup, you know that's the best burger in the world) in California ---- This is it.For the fries, it wasn't fantastic. Just your regular crunchy fries, so those who like them soggy will not find it appealing. The same with their onion rings. The drinks to look out for are their Home-made Lemonade and Root Beer Float. If you like lemonade, go for it. If you are not a fan of that sour and acidic feeling in your belly, do not order them because they taste really authentic. Get the root beer float instead, sip it slowly while you reminisce the times where you grabbed yours at A&W years ago.One thing to take note is that it takes quite some time to prepare, so don't get frustrated if your buzzer didn't ring after 5 minutes. Like I said, don't compare it to a fast food chain. And oh, the washroom; it's 10 miles away from the place. This is the place to go if you want to get away from the buzz of the city and has run out of ideas of what to eat for dinner or teatime. For me, I will definitely return.",

It's important noting that Omakase touts its burgers as smashed burgers, meaning that as they are cooked they are smashed on the grill, leaving the edges crispy. Glorious!The meat was well seasoned, the sweet potato fries crispy and generous portion. The lemonade was super sour just the way I like it. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars rather than 4 is that I thought the burger a bit small for the cost... That being said, I could have gone for the cheeseburger deluxe and added a patties for around 5 bones... Next time!The onion rings look superb, gotta try next time along with some of the craft Japanese beers offered...",

This did slightly detract from the flavour of the burger. \u00a0The ingredients were all quality. \u00a0The condiments were fresh. \u00a0The bacon was tasty goodness. \u00a0The bun was nice and soft. \u00a0The cheese was very melted. \u00a0Thus far, this was the best burger I've eaten in Singapore. \u00a0Even in major US ciites, this would hold up well as a good diner-style burger.tinyurl.com/ajge83lCheese fries (large) - I ordered the cheese fries. \u00a0I did not find these to be particularly great. \u00a0The fries had bit of an oily taste. There was also a sweetness to the cheese-sauce that didn't work for me. \u00a0 I still ate quite a few of them though.tinyurl.com/a2wugnaOmakase Cheeseburger - My colleague went with the basic burger. It looked much less impressive. \u00a0It also looked quite small. \u00a0It certainly would not have filled me up. \u00a0He was less impressed with his burger than I was with mine.tinyurl.com/ae8ts6sSweet Potato Fries - My colleague also ordered the sweet potato fries. I tried one. \u00a0They were quite good. \u00a0They had a nice fresh sweet potato flavour and they had a bit of a crisp to them. \u00a0The portion was not overly generous.tinyurl.com/b3e46nuThey do offer Mexican Coca-Cola and I love it.tinyurl.com/bhjhyvrReceipt (Lunch for 2 - $50.50) - I am not sure what to make of this. \u00a0I know they are having the meat products brought in from the US and that has to affect pricing. \u00a0Plus, beef is just generally expensive in Singapore. \u00a0But, at the end of the day, this was still $50 for two diner-style burgers and some fries. \u00a0That is pretty steep for a burger that is basically on par with In-n-Out.Overall - I think they make a pretty good burger. As I said before, up to now, it is the best burger I've eaten in Singapore. \u00a0I would suggest adding the second patty. \u00a0I would also ask for medium rare instead of the medium they default to. \u00a0Plus, I would order something other than the basic burger. \u00a0Even with the cost, if I was having a serious hankering for a good burger, i would consider returning.",

    "text": "I love me a good burger. And this is a good burger! Somewhat reminiscent of New York's Shake Shack, Omakase does a succulently tender burger with an equally pillowy bun. I tried the Ultimate Cheeseburger with Truffle Fries and Sweet Potato Fries, and they were to die for! The only little hiccup that I encountered was the lack of training/communication between the servers and kitchen staff. I ordered my special sauce on the side, and all was well until I received my burger...sans sauce. Upon asking the kitchen staff for my missing condiment, I was told that they \"do not serve sauce on the side\" as you either \"get the sauce or none at all\". This was a little irksome as the issue was miniscule (IMHO), and could have been avoided altogether had the cashier told me so in the first place. But whatever, Omakase still serves up some darn tasty noms!",

I had the $28.30 set meal with additional patty, sweet potato fries and freshly squeezed orange juice.The prices are difficult to justify (it costs $5.90 to add an additional 100gm patty), and I left somewhat unsatisfied.Don't get me wrong, the burger was delicious, and the patty was cooked just nice (medium). But it tasted like a fresher, better version of a McDonald's burger. I couldn't shake the feeling I was at a slightly upmarket and overpriced fast food joint.",

    "text": "Yum!! Deluxe burger was awesome :) SUCH a soft pillowy bun indeed, as described by some magazine (I forget which, oops.. might have been the papers too). Medium patty was also really soft. Very cheesey, definitely oozing with it and almost dripping all over! Wasn't particularly taken with the secret sauce, but was quite happy adding ketchup :) I normally like my cheeseburgers to be somewhat ketchupy.It really did remind me of an In n Out burger. Except that it's almost six times the price! $13.90 for a small burger.. Aie. It came in wax paper, somewhat like Moz burger (where all the teriyaki sauce collects in a corner) and the end of the burger was somewhat soggy. Bf had the bacon burger and said that the bacon probably detracted somewhat from the burger cos he wasn't as wowed with his burger as I was with mine.Sweet potato fries ($4.90) were nice and crisp. Fairly good portion. Some of the fries further below in the glass cup that they're served in were a bit soggy. Sometimes I like my fries soggy (the McDonalds type, anyhow) but for these, the crispness was good, so no need for soggyness. Lemonade was very lemony and pulpy and somewhat tart! Not too sweet, pretty interesting.",

    "text": "For full reviews and more drool worthy pics, head on over to my blog.So ST has called it the King. 8 days said it's the best. Now here's my skinny on the fat burger.The basic burger is the Omakase Cheeseburger ($13.90). All the patties are ground, blended and hand-formed daily to ensure the freshness. The disformity leads to certain charred bits and extra smokiness but the meat is extremely juicy. The other variations are just the different toppings so it's up to your preference. Deluxe comes with grilled onions and mushrooms ($15.90). There's Bacon as well. Or have all of them in the Ultimate Cheeseburger ($17.50)I had the Deluxe Cheeseburger. My medium rare patty was oozing so much jus the bun became soaking wet and liquid was flowing freely down my hands. Perhaps it was the combination of the toppings but i thought my burger was on the bland side. Should have stuck to my all time fave bacon cheeseburger. But the bun. OH THE BUN. Absolutely buttery and fragrant. I love how it compresses and molds to my fingers and the patty (till it soaked up all the essence). Fantastic bread. The Sweet Potato Fries is a must have and so is the homemade lemonade. The sweet potato fries remained rather crispy even towards the end of the meal. It kinda doubled up as a dessert as well. Very nice starchy texture. So how's Omakase? Well i think it's kinda over hyped. The burgers are decent but it's not like out of this world. Plus the price is on the high side considering it's self service and all. I much preferred Roadhouse and Suprette. They have better ambience and service too.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review two days after I ate at this establishment but the fact that I'm taking time out to write this implies one of two things: It's so frickin awesome that I just have to rave about it or it's so damn awful that I have to rant about it. \u00a0If you look at the stars I've given in this review, you already know the reason. First, let me say that the food at this place IS NOT BAD. It was good, maybe even very good. If anyone has eaten at MOS Burger, you know that they serve quality burgers as well (and at only one-third or one-quarter of the price that you will be paying at Omakase). If you are a burger snob you can holler all you want but I've eaten my fair share of burgers in Singapore and in the United States, so I can reasonably say that certain burger chain-restaurants actually serve great quality burgers at reasonable prices. (Thanks MOS Burger, thanks In-and-Out Burger!) Ok, so I acknowledge Omakase serves good-very good burgers (although I wouldn't go so far as to say they serve the best burgers in Singapore hands down-- I always snigger when I read people writing that phrase). HOWEVER, given the options that are available in Singapore these days where you can spend your hard-earned cash, then it has to be said that you should think twice about the value you are getting from this place. If you are still keen on trying their burgers, I would skip the sides and drinks and save the money for another meal somewhere else the next day. Yup, the sides and drinks cost enough to buy you another meal somewhere else. I think a review has to take into account the quality of the product/service in relation to the price and value. \u00a0It's been two days and I'm still feeling like I overpaid for my single meal experience at this place. Although a merchant has the right to charge \"whatever the market can bear\" with regards to their products/services, there comes a point when the review-accolades given by traditional media (which only take into account the food and not the pricing for the average reader, and most likely complimentary for the writer/blogger anyway) must reasonably take into account the reader who actually has to spend their hard-earned cash at the establishment. That's where Yelp plays its part as a patron-to-patron sharing of opinion and it matters because we all paid to eat there before writing our comments and reviews. \u00a0And it becomes immediately obvious on both Yelp and FourSquare that this establishment has an inflated opinion of what they are offering in terms of their pricing. Majority of comments mention the disproportionate pricing, and they are all valid in voicing this salient point about this place. \u00a0Taking into consideration the increasing number of good burger joints on this island, these guys are really out-of-touch. \u00a0You would be paying around $20-25 for a small burger, fries and drink. Granted, the burger is good, but it's disproportionate to the price you're paying. This is the first establishment that I've really ranted on. \u00a0Most of my reviews are on those that I feel deserve your patronage. I hardly comment or review those that turn out to be a mediocre experience. \u00a0But the fact that this place still disturbs me two days after my experience really warrants a response from me.",

Delicious. Burger patty was juicy and you could see the \"juice\" drip and slide down the paper wrapping. However, the size was pathetic (especially in relation to the price).Truffle fries were average, I could barely taste the truffle.The PRICES are horrendous for a fast food concept style restaurant... I checked out at $27 for a tiny burger, truffle fries and a diet coke... dafuq? This would have cost no more than $7 at in and out AND MY BURGER WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. At this price range, I suggest throwing a couple more bucks in and go to DB for a juicier, more satisfying time.",

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries with a root beer float. The burgers are good. The party is nice and juicy, had it cooked medium and came nicely pink. I liked the bun which was nice and soft, and the lettuce felt very fresh and crunchy. The bacon was crispy but the size...! For $15.90 I felt a little sad that it was probably half the size of triple o's and the same price as their sets. Sweet potato fries are good and root beer float was nice and foamy. I liked that they gave me the whole can, so at least for $5.50 I got a good 2 cups worth. The food is good but expensive for $25+",
