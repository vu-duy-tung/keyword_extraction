    "text": "My 2,000th review should be a place that is special to me. This place happened to become one. On a Tuesday night, our Singapore team wanted to take us here. I had no idea what was in store but was excited to hangout w/ them after work. Everyone but the boss looks different w/o their uniform. A big round table was reserved. A total of 10 of us was there that night. I sat next to Sheng Teck and the boss. We talked about work and random things but the real action came once the food arrived. The boss ordered a whole roasted mini pig, clams, Peking duck, chili crab, butter crab, a chicken nest dish, chow mein, and a plate of rolls (came w/ the chili crab). Everything was great. + roasted pork was succulent + chicken / nest thing was good (but a little strange for me)+ chili crab was delicious (the sauce is bomb!)+ the rolls were buttery soft + the clams (I tried one) was ok+ rice was fluffy + a rare place that serves iced water if requested + service was fast I have a few weird things about me when it comes to food. For one, I can eat shellfish but it needs to be out of its shell first. I am petrified of touching them. I said that at the dinner table, planned to swerve the crab and go for the roasted pork and Peking duck but Sheng Teck took it upon himself to de-shell the crab for me. It was so sweet of him.. I had a shy smile on my face as my fellow colleagues from San Jose gave me a teased look; they know he and I are pretty fond of each other. And they think I bully him but that is untrue! I gave him more than half of my rice and picked food from other plates and gave it to him. I think I know why his colleagues teased him in their foreign language, haha.The culture is different than how it is back home. The team seems to be close, unlike back home. I felt that they all cared for one another genuinely. Jerry and I care about work and about each other but we fight and argue all the time, bringing the fun and laughing element to the Singapore site. A very memorable dinner for me. I miss them dearly. Thanks, Hai Boon for treating us. You've taught me a lot.",

    "text": "A local institution, and always crowded, but Ban Leong's quality is what you might charitably call \"high-variance\". Sometimes everything is great, and other times you get served stale vegetables.What's usually good: - deep-fried prawn paste chicken (crispy, hard to get wrong)- oyster omelette- steamed pomfret- crabWhat's hit-or-miss:- sliced fish with ginger (sometimes quite old)- vegetables (really not a specialty)- tofu (sometimes just downright soggy)Overall I can't really complain for the prices, it's like $15-20 per person but I just wish they'd have really fresh food all the time.",

    "text": "Very reasonably priced Tze char place. Their signature dishes apart from crabs are: prawn paste chicken wings, fried Mee sua, steamed bean paste fish head.We didn't have the crab, but we had:-prawn paste chicken (lightly floured and yummy),- spicy clams (cooked in a spicy eggy gravy. The clams were v clean, plump and no sand at all)- baby squids (the version here is not like those in long beach, jumbo. They are not drenched in sweet sauce but in a tangy sauce. More sweet and sour and nicely crisped)- fried mee sua (nicely done and a big plate is only $12. The noodles is not over cooked and not soggy)Add another veggie dish plus beer, we only paid $70 for 5 pax with too much food. Reservations are taken. So if you plan to come on weekends, it is better to call ahead.",

    "text": "This is my secret chili crab place. Now that I've written about it I don't think it is much of a secret anymore. But it is still quite a hidden find as it is tucked away in the Casuarina estates. However many people do know about it because once they do they return and bring their father mother grandmother etc. That's what I'll do anyway. The most important thing to note is that you should make a reservation on weekends or it will be impossible to get seats. They have 2 eating times - 6 or 8pm. A table sits up to 11 I reckon.The other thing you need to know is this place has awesome chili crabs which are super huge, juicy and fresh. The sauce is also great for mantous. The rest of the tze char dishes are not bad too, but pretty average compared to the stellar crabs. Go for gold!",

    "text": "Ban Leong Wah Hoe is a place you need to get to very early or rather late because it is one of those establishments that gets absolutely packed for weekend dinners if you don't make a reservation, and if you're unlucky, you'll get stuck waiting on a plastic chair by the roadside for a seat. Parking is also a bit of a situation as there's not much around here, you might need to head to the private housing estate across the road.It's a zi char place but they're also quite famous for their crabs - the black pepper crab is especially black here, their chilli crab is a little bit more ketchupy. You also have to try the Ha Cheong Gai (prawn paste chicken) which is one of their house specialties and so yummy.",
