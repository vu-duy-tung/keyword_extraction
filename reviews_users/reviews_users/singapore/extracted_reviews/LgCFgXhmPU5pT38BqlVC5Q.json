    "text": "1 of the best value for money 1 michelin starred restaurants in singapore. Have been dining here since it opened. Their menu is seasonal; spring summer autumn & winter so there is always something fresh & new from chef sun & team every quarter. The food is korean fusion done well, east meets west, the amuse bouche has always given a nice surprise. They used to have an excellent uni bimbimbap & korean seafood pancake when they first opened and i wish they would bring them back. The irish oyster with chojang (korean spicy vinegar) has been around since day 1 and is not to be missed. Lunch is always good value but try to get both courses of desserts & sample their petit fours. The seven course dinner menu will certainly make sure you are full at the end of the meal if you are very hungry.",

    "text": "I wanted to love Meta. Set in a charming venue, we took the 7 course menu. Some of the courses were incredible - the Pigeon, Wagyu, Beetroot Desert and Gochujang Choco stood out. The Grilled Squid was nothing special, and the Petit Fours were a little hit and miss. Based on the food alone, Meta would score a comfortable four stars. It was more imaginative than a lot of tasting menus. The service, however, wasn't incredible. We felt slightly rushed, like they were keen to churn tables. At this price point, you expect a charming Somm to pitch you wine pairings - not here. I'm glad we came, but not desperate to return - especially at $250+ SGD (incl 2x wine glasses, plus service) pp.",

    "text": "Upon searching for Michelin starred restaurants in Singapore to grab lunch at (always a good option if cost is a deterrent because the lunch menu is often a subset of the dinner menu, but the price is much more budget friendly), Meta popped up. Chef Sun's newly minted restaurant on the edge of China Town received its first star this year, so we figured it would be easier to grab a lunch time reservation on such short notice. We lucked out. The food was stellar, the service attentive, and the vibe very hip. We were presented with three flavor-packed, immaculately executed amuse bouche. I don't even know what all the ingredients were in each bite because they were complexly constructed to amount to perfectly balanced bites in texture and flavor. \u00a0For my three courses I ordered the prawn salad, wagyu beef and the tropical dessert. I also ordered the oyster as a supplement. The prawns were perfectly cooked. The beef was rare and cooked evenly throughout, probably via sous vide. It had mushrooms and grilled asparagus. My husband who hates those vegetables liked them, so you know it must have been done well. The dessert was mango sorbet completely submerged in a mountain of coconut whipped cream and passion fruit sauce, with a bit of coconut crumble. The oyster was topped with lemon, ginger and gochujang and was surprisingly not spicy and in fact both savory and sweet. If you're looking for a classy, delicious, truly Michelin experience, look no further. Meta is it. At only $52 SGD pp, it is practically free in Michelin dollars.",

    "text": "I was introduced to Meta when we were there on a special occasion. Located in the colonial style shop house along Keong Saik Road where you will find bustling with people in the night, Meta is a chic restaurant that offers contemporary Asian Cuisine in a Seasonal yet inventive way.Ambiance in Meta is relatively good, no doubt that the restaurant is long and narrow, taking about 30 seats only, either at the bar counter with high stools or the usual tables. Colors used in the restaurant were simple yet soothing under the spotlights, allowing a classy feeling while dining. We had chosen over the bar counters over the seats at the side so that we can enjoy watching the chef preparing the food and enjoying our food served at the dark granite bar counter.With such a relaxing environment, it will be a waste without a sweet class of imported Raspberry beer like this.Raspberry Beer - $12Before we even start our 5 course meal, we were given snack like this, elegantly served on a black tile. \u00a0Small Octopus (Tako) Cubes \u00a0was cradled by the crisply and bubbly squid ink cracker with a dab of cream cheese and few reddish orange caviar. Presentation was exquisite and this snack did really paint a good start for the upcoming dishes with its different kind of texture, crispy, soft and rubbery.Another surprise to me is this, the bite size Kaya toast with truffle butter topped with Parmesan cheese. The toast was such crispy that I had mistaken it for Macarons. Pairing it along with Beef tatare and raddish. Awesome!Fall Menu5 Course Menu ($98) Nothing was more happier to have tasted those soft and thin slices of Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi. They were placed on pickled green apple and mix with yuzu vinegar and basil oil, topping up with Tosaka Nori.Sashimi of Hokkaido ScallopThe driven Chef Sun Kim had turn the sticks of Capellini into its Al Dente Texture in no time. Sitting over the counter was real interesting as I manage to see him using the bigger pasta fork, coiling the pasta up in a tower form. Spanner Crab, as well as some korean seaweed had topped the pasta. Overall, this dish was flavourable in its tasty stock!GuksuFor the additional, Since Chef Sun Kim was from Korea, we thought of ordering his national dish and had a try out. Pancake was tasty and not a bit being starchy. It was filled with calms. Pickled raddish was also provided. It is best recommended to enjoy the Korea Delicacy by dipping onto the special sauce or pouring it over.Seafood Korean Pancake - $25While most of us will expect the pancake to be oily, the Chef had actually taken additional steps reduce the greasiness.Well flavoured and lightly sweetened in its sauce, the Smoked Quail was served in its tenderness. I wasn't expecting that it was such an easy bite on a Quail than on a chicken. Together with the big piece of Portobello Mushroom, leek and raddish, it made a perfect combination.Jasmine Smoked Quail The slow cooked beef cheeks was served with potato gratin. \u00a0The sauce and ingredients used did marry well. Beef Cheek was topped with egg plant, celeriac and watercress.Slow Cooked Beef CheekBeef CheeksGiven the choice between Beef Cheeks or the Lamb, I would prefer the latter. It complemented with the Doenjang (Bean Paste), Carrot and Parsnio.Rack of LambAnother View for Rack of LambThe last item on the menu and its really hard to bid farewell here. Pear was coated in silver with White Chocolate ice cream as pairing. What is unusual here is that you are able to taste some peppery taste in from the ice cream.Dessert - Silver PearlWhite Chocolate Ice Cream with PepperWe called for the bill after the last dish on the menu and was told that was not the end yet. What could it be we thought. It was a nitrogen surprised that came serving in a jar with pebbles. We were told to place the leaf side of the Rock on our tongue to get the full experience. The nitrogen steams then comes up of our mouth while we chew and talked. Wow!The RockI simply love the way how service were rendered throughout my dining even at the counter bar. Emptied plates were consistently cleared with friendly services even from the chef. I recommend this place for those who want to experience a different dining or on a special date. Since its menu is seasonal and definitely I will be very interested to check out its next menu and surprises.",

    "text": "I literally gasped in horror soon after I was seated at the counter and witnessed the chef use the same spoon to taste what he was preparing as he did to mix food he was preparing for a customer. I was in such shock that I sat there for a while to be certain of what I saw. There was a metal canister on the counter in which the chef had a few utensils he was using to prepare and plate food. He grabbed a spoon to mix a sauce and then used the same spoon to taste it, and put the spoon back into the same container. A few minutes later, he grabbed the spoon and did the same.I explained to the waiter what I saw. He said the container was filled with water as if that made it ok. The waiter then said it was very acceptable for a chef to taste food while preparing it, which I completely agreed with, but only if done with a clean spoon each time. I'm sure there are worse practices in restaurants that I have not witnessed as they are behind the scenes. But I would expect much better from a Michelin starred restaurant at this price point. This was simply unacceptable and unsanitary.",

    "text": "I had a hard time trying getting my head around the Contemporary Asian label on Meta, a new stylish restaurant that has opened along the vibrant Keong Saik Road. The background of Chef Sun Kim gave an inkling to the cuisine direction- this good looker hails from a family of South Korean restaurateurs and is also the alumnus of Tetsuya Sydney and Waku Ghin Singapore. I reckoned it would be Asian inspired dishes and flavors with modern techniques and presentation but all that mattered when we embarked on the dinner was 'what's next'. At present, the restaurant offers a choice of three set dinner menus, namely five ($88) and eight-course ($128) Tasting Menus and a five-course Vegetarian Menu ($80). Here we have the eight-course Winter menu.The current appetizer is the Oyster with Pomelo, a plump Irish oyster seasoned with tangy lemon and ginger dressing, and finished with a sprinkle of pomelo flesh for bursts of sweetness. The Amaebi (Japanese sweet shrimp) dish was served with a dashi jelly, trout roe, slivers of pickled beetroot stems and carrot, as well as a smokey charred prawn head. The prawn head was the highlight of the dish though and everything else was what you'd expect of a sashimi dish. As much as the prawn head is super umami, i really do not recommend swallowing the whole thing unless you're ok with shards. Another highlight was the Wagyu Tartare with Egg Jelly and Korean Pear Kimchi. One bite and you know you're having an elegant deconstructed bulgogi bimbimbap with a more refreshing pear kimchi (Sun's homemade kimchi dressing) instead of the regular acidic and tart pickled vegetables. The egg jelly helped to gel the elements together and a topping of puffed rice added crunch to it. \u00a0Scallops are undoubtedly one of my favorite shellfish and these plump Hokkaido ones were paired with a slightly sweeter Korean miso, squid ink cracker and topped with compressed and shaved bottarga for more flavors of the sea. Someone give me more of the cauliflower pur\u00e9e please! Though the separate ingredients were executed well, I felt that on the whole they didn't really come together as a dish and thus it was forgettable. Our favorite dish was certainly the comforting John Dory/Sea Bass with Clams, Fregola and Basil which sees the pan-fried fillet of white fish (that crunchy skin side) presented atop a trio of clams in a clear clam broth (gosh that sweet brine) and finished with drops of basil oil. Slow Cooked Tasmanian Grass-Fed Beef Short Rib with Parsnip was given the Asian touch with pickled oyster mushrooms, charred spring onions and parsnip puree. The beef is cooked sous vide for over 30 hours at 62\u00b0C to break down the tendons and as such, it was kind of gelatinous. I prefer my meat with more grain actually and that is still possible with this technique. Flavor wise, it was on point. Vegetarians can look forward to Meta's dedicated vegetarian menu which features a take on the popular street snack, the Korean Pancake with Seasonal Vegetables, and (purple) Potato Gnocchi with Sweet Corn and Parsnip.For desserts, Pastry Chef Tammy Mah wowed us with her novel and innovative desserts. The classic cheese cake was given a twist with her Citrus Cheesecake with Blood Orange Bon Bon. A golden citrus gel encases the citrus cheese mousse and 2 dark chocolate hemisphere that held a blood orange liquid center. The creaminess melted away to reveal the light bitter crunch, which cracked to contrast the intense and fragrant blood orange jam. The White Chocolate Wasabi Cream with Sesame Sponge and Yoghurt sounded scarier than it tasted. You would hardly notice the wasabi if you didn't know it beforehand. It provided some \u00a0tingliness after each mouth, which was enhanced by the crackly pops. A fun 'petit four' was The Rock, a smoking espresso meringue made on the spot using nitrogen. Smokin hot.A list of cocktail concoctions are available at Meta but I wouldn't say it's their strong suit (that or I really dislike overly sweet drinks).",
