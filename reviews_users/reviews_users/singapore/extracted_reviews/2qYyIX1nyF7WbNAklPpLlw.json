    "text": "Hmm... first time here. And I just want to have a quick and light lunch. It is a modern Chinese dim sum bistro, serving all type of Chinese food from noodle to rice, dim sum. Remind me of P.F Chang restaurant. The price is kind of okay... if you don't compare to the local delicacies in holland village market just across the street. 3x crab meat with truffles dumpling is about $7.2, the salted egg prawn bao is $6. About the taste, I would say ... just okay, not impressive. It is kind of messy when I ate the bao, all the prawns falling apart. I ended up eat them separately. It is just a modified version of \"kong bak bao\". One thing to compliment, their iced plum oolong tea is nice. 3 stars I give, 1 is for the iced tea. Good place to catch up with light food. If you don't mind the food quality.",

    "text": "Cute, funky d\u00e9cor; good service; unusual plating. However, in terms of substance, the food is OK but no wow - much less flavoursome than the best renditions of the original dishes that inspire them, be it claypot rice, aromatic duck, 'mouth watering' chicken, or the baos. The signature char siew is too sweet for most people. The unisex toilets (without urinals) can Be disgustingly wet because of inconsiderate spraying male customers.",

    "text": "If you need a reminder of why you use Yelp, if you miss eating overpriced, terrible food, come here. Everything was way too salty. Ironically the salted egg yolk prawn was the least salty item. To make matters worse, they charge for water. Bear that in mind when you're looking for something to wash the food down. Cute decor, but I was sorely disappointed with the actually terrible tasting food, and the exorbitant prices given the quality.We paid $52 for two of us. The food at the hawker centre beats this hands down.Steamed Scallop and Vegetable Dumplings ($6) - 1 starFilling was salty and the skin wasn't well done - it was thick, mushy and sticky.Salted Egg Yolk Prawn Bao ($11.80 for 2 with tea, $1.80 top up for coffee) - 1.5 starThis wasn't served hot! I expected a soft pillowy bun. Filling was so-so.Braised Cod Fish with Crystal Noodles ($24) - 1 starThis was so salty I ended up asking for a bowl of hot water and dunking the dish inside. Small portion for $24, and it was just noodles, which tasted hard and undercooked on the inside and mushy on the outside, 4-6 small chunks of cod (salty), and 3 pieces of tofu. Not a sliver of greens to be seen.",

    "text": "Tried this place out as it was on the Entertainer, and my heart fell as I read the reviews while I waited for our food. Really I think this is a 2.5* place, but I rounded up for its benefit. The food was not as bad as people have mentioned, and I actually quite enjoyed our moonlight(?) hor fun and mee tai mak. The horfun was good and not as salty as I feared, though the beef was a bit tough and I didn't get any truffle flavor until right at the end. The mee tai mak was meant to be with XO sauce But there was no hint of XO-ness about it. The fried century egg didn't really add anything to the dish in terms of texture or flavor. Overall, nice enough but very average.Lychee oolong tea was nice. This place falls over with its pricing. Two fried noodles and a drink for $48???$20 for a plate of fried horfun is insane, \"truffled\" or not. I would have preferred to go a tze char and ordered a plate for $11 which can feed two people. 50c for water doesn't help its cause. Thankfully the Entertainer brought it down to $29, which really still seems overpriced for what we got to be honest. I'm strongly re-considering bringing this back down to 2 stars....",

Apparently their baos are all \"equally popular\" but judging by other reviews and the crowd around, I'd say more like \"equally unpopular\". We had the pork belly bao and and salted egg prawn bao which was only slightly better than the McDonald's salted egg rendition. Also had claypot rice which was way too salty and the sauce was very gooey. Imo gross, would never go back.2 stars because they have good music.",

The baos were somewhat OK though they're probably too small for lunch. The truffle beef claypot rice however left much to be desired. It was not consistently cooked and the beef was slightly too chewy. Credit for the complimentary fortune cookies though. Probably not worth a repeat visit but you could drop by if you're hanging out in the area.",

Next visit was for their full menu. At Full of Luck Club though it is a Chinese or maybe Fusion restaurant to be more precise, it doesn't have the typical Chinese restaurant vibes. Instead, it has a hipster cafe vibes in it.Full of Luck Club offers 5 savoury Bao at any 2 for $9.80 and 1 and only dessert bao, Hokey-Pokey Ice Cream at $6.Among the 5 savoury Bao, 3 were spicy, namely Kung Pao Fried Chicken,Salted Egg Yolk Prawn and Braised Pork Belly. Next are 2 non-spicy Bao, thePortuguese Pork Chop and Panko-crusted Portobello being the only vegetarian choice.The Bao in general was a little too dense. The consolation is that the fillings were pretty generous and tasty.I was extremely disappointed with the Hokey Pokey Bao ($6) as the bun were frozen and hard. They served me the sweet bao while I was still having my savoury bao therefore I asked to serve later. As such I suspect they must have frozen it to keep the ice cream from melting. With the same token, it resulted in a frozen bun. The ice cream was a little too sweet too.Since Full of Luck Club is by Li Bai, they do offer a good number of Dim Sum dishes too. There are 9 Dim Sum on the menu while we tried only 2. We enjoyed the Baked BBQ Pork Puff ($5.40/3 pcs) more than Crispy Beancurd Skin Rolls with Shrimps and Chives ($6/3 pcs).The Baked BBQ Pork Puff has generous amount of stuffing cum a flaky pastry. As for the second Dim Sum item, though the stuffing was equally generous and it was with crispy beancurd skin, a pity the wrap was soaked with oil.I spotted few of my all time favourite dishes such as Golden Sand Corn with Salted Egg Yolk ($4.80), Poached Wontons in Chilli Soy ($7.20), Crispy Salmon Skin with Salted Egg Yolk ($6) and Deep-fried Squid with Salt and Pepper($8). There are 6 light bites in total which made great starters but we ordered none. Instead, we moved directly to the Sharing Plates.We ordered only the Braised Spinach Benacurd ($16) and enjoyed everything about the beancurd as the beancurd was silky and well seasoned. However, I find the sauce a little too starchy.We were glad to spot a section on Claypot Rice. We went for the Black Bean Smoked Duck ($14), It was delish.There are 3 interesting Iced Tea served at the restaurant; Lychee Oolong Iced Tea ($4.50), Raspberry Pu-er Iced Tea ($4.50) and Sour Plum Oolong($4.50). I was glad that they no longer serve the Iced Tea in disposed plastic cup, instead in a tall glass.In a nutshell, we enjoyed the food and drinks prepared at Full of Luck Club. There are interesting choices for sharing or for solo dining. And since it is next to a MRT station, diners need not worry rain or shine.More reviews at nahmj.com",
