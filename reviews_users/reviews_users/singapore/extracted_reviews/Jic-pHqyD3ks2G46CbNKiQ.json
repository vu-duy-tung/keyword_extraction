I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the scallops and how flavorful the pasta were. Serving could be bigger but I would still recommend this place.",

    "text": "This is just for their non-alcoholic drinks.== Drinks ==Ordered a cranberry juice and an Italian soda. One of those days that we just want a non alcoholic beverage.Both were meh. Cranberry juice felt extremely artificial and the Italian soda was super sweet and took ultra long to arrive.It was around 10pm and the place was full. They have a cute rooftop setting. Partially sheltered. The non sheltered section allows you to have an awesome view of the city however it was also their smoking corner, so the place was unbearable for me.The crowd on the roof deck appears to be on the late 30s. They have some seating on B1 and some on 1. The B1 were filled with a younger crowd.We sat on L1, outdoor seating. The service was incredibly slow but at least the server was sincere and apologetic about it.Overall all, I think this place is rather over rated at least as a hangout place.",

    "text": "Maybe all the fuss is about the roof deck and the food, but when we came in around opening time, we weren't offered either, and settled for drinks in the basement.The beer selection is modest - big by Singapore standards, with higher than average prices, which comes part and parcel with the location. I would have liked to try the food, but by the time the kitchen opened, our group of 3 had already traded $90 for a mild buzz, and decided to call it quits. The decor is fun, though I left feeling underwhelmed.",

    "text": "In this part of town rooftop bars can often be too fancy for my liking. Mr Punch however is very chilled out and unpretentious. I can't believe I didn't come here any earlier.The alfresco bar area is my favourite. It can get quite hot, but most of the time on most nights in Singapore it is pleasantly breezy. There is a one page tapas/bar food list. Most of it is not bad but nothing to shout about. At least they are not exorbitantly priced. The food tends to be not as hot as it should be (we had pizza that came cold), but if you send it back it's alright. Five bottles of beer is $50 here so it's pretty cheap for this part of town. Service is very spotty though. But for the view and the location, it's great. It's on the top floor of the MINT Museum of Toys.",

    "text": "Located on the rooftop of Mint Museum of Toys on Seah Street, this is certainly a very nice rooftop bar that is pretty popular considering that it can get rather packed.Even though I'd like to give it more stars, it has to remain at 3 because they have a dress code. As much as it appears to be casual and unpretentious, my partner was once denied entry because he was overly casual that day and had chosen to wear slippers. It was still possible to have a drink on the ground floor where they had a few tables set-up by the pavement, but we couldn't access the rooftop which was our primary reason for being there in the first place. Nevertheless, it remains a nice enough place with a good selection of drinks and food, just make sure you dress appropriately.",

It has a nice view of the city hall area, albeit being a little short for a roof top bar, and the walls are covered with retro bottlecaps, old retro signboards etc. The variety of alcohol is wide, and I like a full bar that serves a range of hard liquor, from cheap vodka to belvedere. In general, a decent bar to hang out on a Friday night, and the selection of alcohol caters to almost anyone.",

    "text": "The thing that draws me to this place is the interesting location it is housed at. As you take the lift up to the rooftop where Mr Punch is located, an interesting string of words on the lift door greets you. Namely, \"Whoever has the most toys when he dies wins\". Yes, this place is a museum of toys in the day! At night, from 6pm onwards, the rooftop bar is open for business. It is open every day till 2am (Mondays - Thursdays) and 3am (Fridays - Saturdays), and is closed on Sundays.The alfresco area overlooks Raffles Hotel and various skyscrapers. Unfortunately the alfresco area is quite small. I much prefer the air-conditioning indoors though - the wallpaper at Mr Punch is most interesting, with bits of American-infusion stickers lining the entire wall. Beers are at $10 each, wines at $13 a pop and the signature \"Mr Punch\" drink costs $12.",

    "text": "One of the best times to visit this bar/restaurant would be on days where there are fireworks! We all try to find hot spots to catch the fireworks during new year's and national day, but few will think of the Mint Museum of Toys. The Museum hides a rooftop open air bar that offers a perfect few of the fireworks area, as well as the Singapore skyline. Located just 5 minutes away from CIty Hall Station (behind Raffles Hotel), the food served at the restaurant is slightly above average, with hot favourite dishes such as truffle fries, nachos, steaks and lambs. Commonly available alcoholic drinks are also available, but the view is why I rate this bar highly. There is both sheltered as well as alfresco seating - the alfresco area offered the best view, but were already taken up as we arrived late at about 11pm. Regardless, we still had a pretty unobstructed view, and settled in to wait. Staff were young and spontaneous, and were dressed up to ring in the new year with us! They also gave out party favours like party hats, poppers and silly string to patrons at 11.50pm to add to the cheer - a nice touch to the evening! One gripe would be how uncomfortably small the place was, I had the nagging feeling they were squeezing in as many table and stools as they could in every nook and cranny to fill the bar. But can't complain, since we did get a seat! Great place to spend a rowdy night out with friends!",

    "text": "Tell you a secret. Mr Punch's rooftop bar has a super view of the fireworks on New Year's or National Day. Not just that, they also serve great food and drinks at an affordable price for the location. I'm a fan of their crabcakes, crispy crust packed with flavour and a good hit of lemongrass. This is a great hangout for groups because of the laidback rooftop atmosphere. You can also choose to dine in the quieter underground floor of the restaurant if you're there on a romantic date - the space is nicely decorated wtih all-american posters and signs, makes you feel like you're in an all-american diner. There are daily promotions on their drinks. On thursdays, all signature Mr Punch cocktails go for only $10.Final verdict: Packs quite a punch with the ambience and food!",
