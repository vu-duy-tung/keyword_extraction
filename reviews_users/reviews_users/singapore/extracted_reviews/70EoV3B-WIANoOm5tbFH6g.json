Tasty, crispy and delicious.We also have the Hokkien mee (noodles). \u00a0Not sure how Hokkien meeting should taste like - I'll reserve judgement when I have more experience ( Ie. eat more)The server suggested that we try their Porkchop and Spring Rolls. \u00a0We declined since we were trying to limit our intake of deep fried food. \u00a0I'm guessing that the 2 items we declined to order could be delicious given how delicious the Salt Egg Bitter Mellon tasted.I highly recommend Nan Hwa Chong for a novel (for non SE Asians or non Chinese) visiting Singapore.Service was fast, friendly and efficient.",

Nan Hwa Chong Fish Head Steamboat Corner adopt the use of charcoal instead of the ususal gas can operated steamboat pot. It is said that the use of charcoal to fire up the broth gave a smoky flavour and an even heat distribution to the broth itself.Location is rather prominent as it is located at the traffic junction. However, one thing that one might be worrying if driving would be the parking spaces.Not long after we settled down, we notice the constant stream of patrons walking into the shop. Everyone who walks in were promptly attended by the server. Most who came in had already made reservation via phone call before hand and they were directed to the air conditioned corner of Nan Hwa Chong.Seeing this station as the toughest job of all standing in front of the flames ensuring that the charcoal are evenly burn and stuffing them into the every steamboat that comes out from the kitchen.Supposed to be their recommended egg dish, however we got it served with the middle part burnt. Nevertheless the texture still remains fluffy and taste ordinary with a handful of oysters.The plate of stirred fried broccoli is my kind of home cook dishes. The light taste of broccoli greens is cooked with carrots, ginger and button mushrooms with minced garlic.We had chosen the grouper fishboat. The grouper fish comes from the sea-bass family.It is low in fat and cholesterol with firm texture and mild flavour. A healthy choice that does not compromise in taste. Three other types of fish offered will be Pomfret, Song Fish Head and Snapper Fish.Grouper Fish Medium Pot - $35Ingredients include fish, vegetables, seaweed, fried taro, flat fish, white cabbage and grouper fish. Soup is rich and sweet.While the cloudy soup may be made up by the yam, unlike other places they were done by adding milk to it. If you are wondering about the familiar taste in the stock, its the generous portions of flat fish added to the soup that gave a different taste to it.Not only that the fried yam added had also elevated the soup taste.Simply love dabbing the fish meat into this sweet sour and spicy chilli.If you love traditional fish steamboat with charcoal, Nan Hwa Chong Fish-Head is a very good choice. Not only that, they do have a variety of Cze Char Dishes in the menu for selection too.",

Soup base was really good as well, and I really liked the ingredients, especially the yam.We also tried the homemade beancurd, with chilli sauce, amazing. Really the only negative is that the drinks aren't made in-house. Service was prompt and prices decent, about $30 per pax. Will be back if I'm in the area.",

It is packed when we got back during some late nights and also occupied the street around 6ish.Every table enjoys the steamboat (usually we tend to call it hot pot). The must-have pot is a steamed soup of fish, veggie, pickled Chinese cabbage, salted fish and seaweed. All the freshest.Singaporean cuisine is renowned for its satay, laksa, Hainanese chicken, chilli crab which all featured greasy. But hands down for this simple, pure, soul, comfort fish soup!! More than just a break from the spicy food, but truly get to taste the MSG free delicacy. The snacks are also local, stand out from the Hawcker Centres. Large portions and very reasonable price. The locals knows the best.",

    "text": "This is one of the best \"old school\" charcoal style steamboats that you HAVE to try if you enjoy fish based charcoal steamboat.They sell many other oh-so-yummy sze-char dishes too even if you don't feel like steamboat.They get VERY crowded around dinner time especially on weekends from 6pm - 10pm. They did however take over the unit beside them and have a small air-conditioned area.Parking seems to be quite the problem here though like others have mentioned so do take note about that or just park further away and be prepared to walk a bit. Oh and they do close quite late! Most of the staff seem to speak Chinese with very little english so communication may be a slight problem if you don't speak the language. Maybe to avoid grumpy staff scolding you when they're busy, come for supper when it's less crowded? Haha.. it does get pretty hectic during dinner time! However, if you're a foodie, its definitely one of the \"must try\" steamboat places to visit to take your taste palette down memory lane. :)Things I normally order and enjoy - Grouper Fish Steamboat and Salted Egg Pork Ribs!4.0 Stars",

The thing that kills me here is the parking. I wish wish wish that they provide valet parking.3.5 stars for the food, 0.5 stars for tradition!

There's something about a charcoal steamboat that you can get with an electric one or even a gas steamboat. It's probably all that traditional smoky goodness that adds a load of flavor and depth to the soup. Their other dishes are pretty happening as well. Definitely worth a go. If you're heading there, best not to drive though. Parking isn't the best around the area.",
