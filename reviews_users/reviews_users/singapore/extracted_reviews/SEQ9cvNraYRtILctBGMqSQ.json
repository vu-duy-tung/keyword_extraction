    "text": "First experience at Bao Today. Actual venue is renovating so is a little smaller area for now. As picture, have ordered for wanton noodle, cha siew bun, curry chicken with buns/rice, their special grass jelly/yuan yang beverages. Firstly, the wanton noodle is not bad but too little filling. Secondly, the curry chicken and curry potato is nothing special and taste plain. The buns for the curry is too oily and doesn't taste good. Thirdly, the cha siew bao is good. Conclusion: will not come back again.",

    "text": "I really love dim sum. Unfortunately the popular spaces are really expensive, so I was excited to hear that Bao Today was having a $2.50 promotion for all dim sum. I used to frequent Bao Today frequently when their Raflles Place branch was still open, so I know they serve pretty good dim sum. My wife and I were pretty disappointed in the drop of standard. I'm not sure if it's across all branches, or just the 313 branch. We ordered 10 dishes in all. Everything was pretty average, except their signature salty egg yolk bao (AKA liu sha bao), which was below average. Those dimsum with gravy (eg. char siew chang fen, steam carrot cake), are served in paper plates. I wouldn't go so far as to say the cashier and waiters were rude, but they definitely lack training in service. I could see the scowl on the cashier's face as the person in front of me (a tourist) asked her questions about their food, size of the portions, etc. etc. She was also clearly struggling with her english.they lost 4 stars because:- non-airconditioned seating only- bad service- serving dim sum in paper plates- no hot drinks (really?!? no chinese tea at a dim sum place?)I gave them 1 star for: Cheap dim sumthat's really the only reason you'd ever come back here. I might still give the Bras Basah branch a shot. At least it's a full-serviced restaurant.",

    "text": "It's a very depressing place to go for lunch. We were not greeted by the waitress when we entered the premises. She just have this sad and blank look on her. I've seen this restaurant at Rendezvous Hotel, so we decided to give it a try. When we called for the waitress to order, she just pointed to an order sheet. Oh! We have to fill up ourselves. Got it! I've ordered the char Siew combo. Bad choice. All the meats are dry. I'm sure you must have guessed it, food was just placed on our table without a word. We asked for Chilli, we thanked the waitress, again no response. I have to say that the Chilli is the best part about dining there for us. Another waitress delivered my husband's dish. And for a moment we were hopeful that this waitress will make a pleasant experience. None of that. When I stood up to indicate that we want to pay, I was pointed to the cashier. The cashier just pushed the bill to me, I paid and she received and gave me the change. I have to say that the service here is totally unified - no communication to customers as much as they can within their means. I'm puzzled. Restaurant business are very competitive. Can they survive with this level of service? The corporate culture is depressing. It makes me wonder if these staff are badly treated to do this to the clients.Difficult getting into their corporate website too!",

She did not looked like she wanted to be working there! \u00a0The Bao with flowy custard is reputed to be good. So I bought some as take away- verdict: it's good. But not the service.",

I decided to order a noodle dish, some BBQ buns, pork shumai and a pineapple smoothie. The noodles were tasty but on the salty the side. The buns and shumai were nothing to brag about. The pineapple smoothie was delightful, but it wasn't worth the cost of $5. The service was so-so, but service tends to be hit or miss in most places in this city. Since there are so many places to grab dim sum and buns in Singapore, I don't really plan on returning to this place.",
