It's slightly spicy but smell and taste amazing! If you have the budget, their Portuguese lobsters is the bomb. The creamy sauce combined with the crispy lobster is heaven. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have great seafood!",

    "text": "Chili crabs are a must when in SG. We initially planned to visit Jumbo but ultimately went to King for the fact that they accept reservation. I had no chili crab baseline to compare to but King's was really tasty! Very saucy - my husband slurped it up like a soup, I drowned every grain and green in it. A good balance of buttery aroma and sweet chili. Fried buns are a must for soaking up every drop. I easily downed a whole dozen myself. Salted egg fried shrimp - apparently salted egg on every edible item is a huge trend in SG right now (ie fish skins, chips). Salted egg fried shrimp - another genius invention. Crispy head on shrimp dusted in \u00a0broken salted egg. Perfectly seasoned - I ate all parts shells included. Curry crab noodle soup - hugeeee pot! Very soothing - not overwhelmingly curryful which allowed the crab's natural sweetness to fill up each bowl! Soy steamed local fish - I can't recall the name of the fish (I was told it's not the most attractive). But the meat was so moist, flaky, and sweet! They also offer a deep fried version. Stir fried egg noodles - yummm, plenty of wok flavor and heat. Nothing like the Chinese version, the flavor was spot on. A great balance of sweet, salty, and spicy. They also offer a handful of non seafood dishes (mushroom beef tenderloin, general tso chicken). They were fine but I would stick to their seafood items tho. Overall - we enjoyed our meal tremulously! Don't forget to ask for gloves+bibs and get ready for a feast!",

    "text": "How this place doesn't have five stars boggles my mind. Service was great (not that you should care about service in any Asian country). It was raining outside after we finished and they suggested we sit for a little while until it stopped raining. On to the food! We came here for 2 things of course. Chilli crab and black pepper crab. It was just my wife and I, they let us get a 1.9kg crab and cook it both ways. I'm not going to tell you how each tasted because I don't want you to have any preconceived notions on how it should taste, but both were mind blowing. Like nothing I've ever had before. I was moreso looking forward to the chilli crab because that's what Singapore is more known for. But that black pepper crab...boy was it tasty. I feel like this place reminds me of Philadelphia. You go for the cheesesteak, but those in the know actually get the roast pork with broccoli rabe. I'd suggest to get both either way, they're both great. The fried bread dipped in the sauce was also super good. Come here and don't listen to anyone else's reviews that aren't five stars. They're just bitter people who nitpick on everything.It is a bit pricey, but Singapore is an expensive city so chill the fuck out. Our 1.9kg crab cost $156. Most places will be around $65-70 per kilo so it's right in that price range.",

They freakin forgot to put my damn order in!!! Had to ask for my tea to be refilled as the girl walking around didn't bother checking on my table! They don't even deserve 1 star! I wish I could give them a negative! I don't understand how they get such good ratings! Probably getting their ratings from the friends & family! Just an advice to the people working at this restaurant.. never judge people by the way they dress nor have any body tattoos! I'm not there to BEG for food... I'm there to PAY FOR MY OWN food!!! We all should be treated equally! From the moment I walked in, I could already notice by the facial expression that you people didn't want to sit me at the table! All I could say is \u00a0out!

    "text": "Man, it's hard to find consensus on chili crab. You search for \"best of\" lists, and some of the recommendations have terrible reviews. You walk down the street and see some that look good - reviews say the exact opposite. Is there any place that everyone loves? Make it easy on a tourist, huh?But this seemed to be the closest to a safe bet that I could find, plus it was pretty convenient. So I made the trip and I was not disappointed. I went bog standard - chili crab with fried buns. I was asked, do I want them steamed or fried? Well, what would you recommend? \"Oh. You want the fried.\" OK then.The crab came out, steaming hot, too hot to hold, honestly. Along with it was provided a sealed wet towelette, a glass full of those over-sized plastic (not rubber/latex) gloves, a bunch of paper napkins, a pair of chopsticks (to do what with? I know I'm not great at chopsticks, but I'd love to see someone use them to eat a whole crab) and a shell cracker (but the crab is broken up, partially cracked already). I proceeded to coat myself in the sauce...because eating this is a mess.But oh is it worth it. When you extract a big hunk of crab meat, and you dredge it in the thick, spicy, tomato sauce...I was literally getting exciting, thinking \"oh yeah, here it comes\" to myself as I got each bite out of the shell and got ready to eat it. And the buns, holy cow. A golden thin and crispy outside, steamed white bread goodness on the inside. I exercised restraint and did not order 47 more of these - I wanted to return the plate to them pretty much spotless after wiping up every last bit of the sauce. I'd bathe in the stuff.It was pricey - easily the most expensive meal I had in Singapore, by almost a factor of 10 over most meals. Part of that is because I was mostly eating at crazy cheap hawker stalls and kopitams (and loving every second of it) and part of that is because chili crab tends to be expensive. But this was worth it. I'm glad I sorted through reviews, I'm glad I spent the money - just great.I'm going to hold back a star for what I think is some sad nickel and dime. For example, they charge you for the wet napkin. Seriously? OK, yeah, it's 30 cents. NBD. But...they don't tell you until later. Plus they charge you for \"peanuts\" - this was on my bill even though I didn't get any (but the waitress caught this herself and took it off). They charge per bun (This is can understand, although this is also where they could easily get me, I wanted to tell them not to let my plate get empty), but they don't tell you that. Apparently this peanut and napkin thing is common - I even saw signs near rows of restaurants warning of the practice - but...it just seems really petty when I'm paying 100SGD for a whole crab.",

    "text": "It was finally time tonight for me to try Black Pepper Crab. \u00a0I chose Long Beach Seafood because I wanted to explore a new District so I MTR'ed to Mountbatten to try it out over in Kallang.The entrance has an odd air of cacophony as multiple workers each with title badges parade about doing what they do best from the supervisor supervising to the cashier person pricing things. \u00a0Although they speak English, an awful lot got lost in translation which left me an uneasy patron unsure where I stood with regard to the pricing of what I was ordering. \u00a0As an illustration, I asked for a glass of beer (@$7.75) but wound up with a jug of beer ($23-ish) because the owner assumed I wanted a jug because I'm a stupid tourist or because I look like the type of person who wants a jug or he wanted to maximize how much money he could get out of me and simply willed me to have more than what I asked for. \u00a0I didn't appreciate that even if the intentions were good.Also, communicating our order was a bit of a guessing game. \u00a0The menu lay-out was confusing. \u00a0It had pricing but it seemed difficult deciding what to order. \u00a0The Crab menu was baffling too. \u00a0No pricing but evidently the \"large\" weighed between 800-900 Grams (whatever that means...too bad I didn't have a measurement converter ap on my phone) or the larger Sri Lankan crab weighing at around 1,000 grams.When we asked the server, it wasn't clearly explained to us and came off as if the price were $62 for either order which made no sense. \u00a0Because the communication wasn't clear, my appetite was waning.We ordered a few other items such as baby gai lan, a shrimp dish, and this fried tofu dish.All in all the dishes were ok. \u00a0I must admit that I was still excited about the Black Pepper Crab and when it arrived, I was in for a battle. \u00a0There was quality in the flavor and it became the only focus of my attention once it was plopped there in front of me. \u00a0Black pepper crab is buried in a pepper sauce giving the crab an almost medicinal flavor to it. \u00a0Initially, it's strange but then it becomes good. \u00a0It took me forever to eat that crab and I was a complete mess by the time I finished it. \u00a0That became a problem because all the other dishes, which I ignored, became cold by the time I was done.Throughout the eating process, I felt an uncomfortable \"chi\" there. \u00a0Staff were constantly darting by my table and seemingly marking me too often which was distracting.On the other hand, they were good about tending to my needs such as clearing away my plate that had carved out shells. \u00a0The service was also very prompt in general. \u00a0Food came pretty quickly, etc.But the overall vibe here made me uncomfortable for some reason. \u00a0It wasn't a fun place to eat at as the sound acoustics were noisy and the staff constantly rushing by made me dizzy. \u00a0I guess the table wasn't a good location giving the working dynamics of this restaurant.By the time it was over, we left paying over $200 and didn't really feel it was worth it. \u00a0If anything, I wouldn't pay that much to come here again even though the food was pretty good.I wouldn't recommend this place for a tourist, but, they do give their best and the place had certain good qualities to it like high traffic and clean overall facilities.Loved the tank filled with lively Alaskan King Crabs to the right of the entrance.",

We had to order a couple of things twice as orders were just not turning up.Overall, it's a pleasant restaurant with reasonably good food... and worth a trip for the pepper crab and chili crab alone :-) \u00a0 ...however, make sure you bring a credit card ;-) - it really isn't inexpensive...",

The sauce of the chili crab was amazing and you will need the buns to dip into that sauce. Don't try chili crab at a Hawker Centre; go to this place that specializes in chili crab... Huge difference.",
