    "text": "A fine restaurant tucked away in a colonial bungalow at Scotts Road, I was surprised by the tranquility and calmness brought on by the simple decoration of the interior.The food was nothing short of amazing, as one would expect from the prices. We had the $150+ lunch and the portions were just right. We were extremely satisfied at the end - not full enough to curse ourselves for torturing our tummies, yet not hungry enough to crave for more food.Every dish was executed to perfection, and I enjoyed sitting at the bar watching the chefs at work. Recommended!",

    "text": "Sugoi (incredible) umami (savoury) sushi by chef kazu. A dinner during white truffle season is the best. Uni (sea urchin) & white truffles make a very innovative & interesting combination. Next the amadai horse head fish with its deep fried crispy scales & hot steamy snapper in soup make for a close to Tokyo style sushi experience at the 10 seater bar counter, not forgetting creamy sweet chutoro/otoro/maguro (tuna belly). Dessert is also definitely a treat with their homemade mochi & special tea ice cream filled macaron.",

Service: The staff were too cute. Not only were they extremely attentive throughout the entire meal, they spoilt me with a birthday cake towards the end. The entire crew, yes including both sushi chefs, stood around and sang a birthday song - #winHighly recommended.",

    "text": "In my opinion, this is the only Japanese restaurant in Singapore worthy of 3 Michelin Stars and I hope they get it next month.They do everything right here, from the food to the setting to the service to the sake. It's a complete experience from beginning to end and beyond.Yes this is expensive, moreso than any other of the Singapore high end Japanese spots (maybe moreso than ANY restaurant in Singapore, possibly more than Hashida) but you truly get what you pay for. Chef Hamamoto-San is a true artist and you will see it in the presentation you get to enjoy.My girlfriend and I went for the full-fledged omakase as well as the Ki-Sho branded sake which I would HIGHLY recommend. It's essentially a smooth and elegant Juyondai sake and you won't believe how quickly you will finish it. A side note, one of the criteria for restaurants to receive 3 Michelin Stars (outside of Japan) is that they must master each of the major food groups and include it on their tasting menu - that includes sea, MEAT, veggies, and dessert at the very least. Ki-sho makes a bold statement from the beginning as the first course if a beautifully tasting and hard to get beef nigiri. The rest of the experience was amazingly done and Chef Hamamoto-san himself is a lot of fun to talk to. Be careful because this meal will leave you extremely full.Even though most top-tier sushi restaurants have chefs and staff that know their sake very well (except for a certain place that has two hotel locations and enjoys only recommending what is most expensive at both locations), Ki-sho also has an in-house sake sommelier that is the best. I highly recommend you check out his upstairs sake bar, you'll go on a sake adventure with his insanely huge collection of all different types of sakes from all over Japan. They also serve food up there too so check it out for a more casual night of something different rather than going to a typical bar.I highly recommend that you check this place out if you want the epic Japanese omakase experience in Singapore.",

Says your mouth every time you place the nigiri on your tongue. \u00a0The fish is ever convoluted and rich with flavours from the mysterious depths of the ocean. \u00a0When you come here, you have to go for the Omakase. \u00a0From the vast assortment of dishes, Chef Hamamoto-san places the fish at just the perfect temperature, perfect amount of wasabi, and consistency of rice for my taste. \u00a0(I know some other Michelin-star restaurants would prefer to leave the frozen fish out to room temperature or put twice as much wasabi between the fish and rice, which is perfectly fine, just not my most favorite form). \u00a0His humble and warm demeanour makes the whole place so much more inviting and lively. \u00a0The service is superb, but then again with a great chef as Hamamoto-san, you wouldn't expect anything less. \u00a0At the end of the very filling and pleasant meal, we conversed with the chef for a while. \u00a0When everyone had retired for the evening, he invited us to his upstairs sake bar. \u00a0Unfortunately we had to politely decline: \"Next time, next time...!\" We said as we almost stumbled out the door from a food comma.It's been months since I last came here, but my tongue from the north still remembers.",

    "text": "The best charm of Ki-sho in addition to its authentic interior and Japanese culteries is its food and people. With food freshly flown in from Kyoto and around the world, Chef Kazu serves only the best, and will happily prepare food in accordance to diners' dietary requirement. The service staffs are prompt and sincere, making dining at Ki-sho feels like stepping into a little piece of Kyoto right in the middle of Orchard Road. The omakase dishes are intricately designed, balancing the tastes from the different flavours of the ingredients. I had shirako (cod sperm), fugu (puffer fish) and uni (sea urchin) for the first time at Ki-sho and thoroughly enjoyed them. Desserts were light, sweet and an intoxicating end to a great evening. The restaurant also has a wide selection of sakes available for pairing with the dishes. For the special occasions and days of self pampering, I highly recommend Ki-sho.",
