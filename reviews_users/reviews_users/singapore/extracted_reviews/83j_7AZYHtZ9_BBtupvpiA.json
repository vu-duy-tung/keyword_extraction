It was served lots of fries and side salad. The patty was thick and juicy.",

    "text": "Bought 2 groupons for all-you-can-eat Australian Beef Buffet at Barossa Bar for $35 each. The waitress suggested that since it's our first time, she will order 1 of everything for us to try it out. We happily obliged :DFirst came the sauces: My favorite is the yellow truffle bearnaise tasted like truffles mixed wth awesome nacho cheese. Then came the appetizers/sides: I love the creamed spinach as it came with crispy toasted layer of cheese.The mash potato tasted good with the sauces, however I suspect it's their plan to give such a big serving of potato to make you full on the cheap stuff - evil!Finally, the beef arrived: If you are coming to Barossa for their beef buffet, just spam the Wagyu D Rump. Its definitely the best beef out of the other choices, easy to cut, thick. juicy and chewy.",

    "text": "Slow. Expensive. Reservations for 20 pax was made in advance so I would expect the kitchen to be somehow prepared for the large party arriving. When we arrived, there were not enough tables and chairs. The table was not even set up with cutlery. We were not given any menus. We were organised enough to write down all our orders before going to the staff to get them to take them down. She still managed to miss something out.We had about 7 kids in the group and ordered fish and chips and pizza for kids. When we ordered it, it was mention that these items were for the kids. But the kids' food was the last to arrive. The poor kids were starving and their food didn't arrive until past 7:30pm, even though we all arrived at 6pm.Drinks took ages to arrive and even request for water took a few reminders. I wouldn't mind if the food was great. It was all overpriced. The meat platter was over cooked, even though we asked for medium well done. The prawn linguine has way too much black pepper to be able to enjoy.The barossa salad was a joke. It was $18 and it was the serving of a side salad with nothing much in it.We won't be going back there again.",

    "text": "Barossa's prime draw might be its location: at the Esplanade, open-concept dining with big, chunky, wooden tables and chairs (reminds me of Brotzeit), live bands playing in the distance. Enough said: the ambience is as good as it gets if you're in town but don't want to jostle for space while dining.We tried the thin-crusted pizzas and french fries, and found little to complain about. The pizzas were delicious: the crust was done just as it should, crispy without being burnt on the underside. As for the french fries, they were heavenly - we could not stop dipping them into the sauces. Definitely a keeper.As for the Archipelago beer, I found it to be suitable for pairing with pizzas and fries, but the brew I had (the original version) wasn't that outstanding. The aftertaste did not linger for long, and the fragrance evaporated after a while.Opening hours:Monday to Friday lunch - 12pm - 3pmMonday to Thursday dinner - 6pm - 1amFriday dinner - 6pm - 2amSaturday Sunday: open whole day from 12pm - 2am (Sat) 12pm - 1am (Sun).Last orders for kitchen at 1030 Sunday to Thursday and 1100 on Friday Saturday with bar bites available till 1230.",

The ambience is pretty decent, and while service could be better, I'm really closing an eye because the meats are really great! And the price you pay is really reasonable to enjoy all the good cuts of meat. In fact, I'd say its a better place to visit compared to buffets. Just get a couple of sides like fries to go along your meat and you'll have a nice meal all set up. Not really a fan of their beer though.",

And prices are pretty decent too, around 40+ per person which you can easily get your money's worth if you can go for around 3 to 4 rounds. Quality is very good considering they serve it buffet style.However, I noticed that the speed of serving decreased the more we ordered, I guess its something they have to implement or else they'd go out of business with ravenous people dropping by all the time.Ambience is nice and chill, sadly, wish they had the free flow nights on Fridays and Saturdays instead. That would be perfect.",

    "text": "Sure, the location is great, and I won't deny that our pizza and fish and chips were delicious and that the garlic fries were a definite winner. However, I am only giving Barossa two stars because it falls flat on its face when it comes to service. We arrived in the early evening and it was still quiet. The service staff was alternating between talking amongst themselves and busying about to ready the place for the evening crowd. In light of all this activity, asking them for the menu seemed like the biggest inconvenience that I could have placed on them. First impressions? Not good. The clincher came when we asked to have a round of iced water. Appallingly, they have a policy of not serving iced water to their patrons and our entire exchange was handled by a trainee, who kept walking back and forth to check with her supervisor, and inform the latter that we were willing to pay a small fee, etc. At no point did the supervisor decide to take over the exchange at all, leaving this hapless, uncertain newbie to negotiate the situation. Eventually, they conceded and allowed us to have glasses of iced water at 30 cents a pop. But really, Barossa? Serving premium pub grub and Archipelago beers hardly qualifies you as part of the \"sparkling or still\" club.",

Doused with your favourite sauces ranging from truffle sauce to your favourite sides such as mashed potatoes mixed with truffle. Certainly a meat lover's heaven.Could it be the golden fried batter? Or could it be the flavourful, chunky french fries? The Archipelago fish and chips at $24++ is one of the best I've eaten in town. Fish 'n' co's selection of fish and chips pales in comparion to Barossa's Archipelago Fish and Chips which is double starred in their menu, and deservedly so. Further, their Archipelago craft beer variety is substantial, . Definitely one of my top favourite places to unwind after work.",
