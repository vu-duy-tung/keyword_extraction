    "text": "Founder Bak Kut Teh at Balestier always reminded me of great memories I had in Singapore, memories that were spent catching with people that I loved. I was first introduced to this place by Ria during our quick trip to Singapore. The Founder bak kut teh was also a great place to hang out for late night supper and they had a couple of big table for large group of people. The restaurant didn't look like much from the outside but sometimes during dinner time you could saw a long line formed with diners who couldn't wait to taste the peppery broth of the bak kut teh. I think I got a bit too addicted to the broth and the leftover broth was very enjoyable when eaten together with warm rice.The long ribs was my favourite because bone made it very easy to hold the whole ribs. Sometimes they ran out of the long one and I had to order the short ribs. Both types of pork ribs were juicy and tender.Our usual order usually consists of you tiao (the fried dough), bean curd skin, the must-have salted vegetables, braised eggs, peanuts and heaps of chili padi! Yes, I added a lot of chili padi to the broth to make it spicier (yum). We always end our dinner with a refreshing bowl of Ice Jelly Honey Lime!My last time at the Founder Bak Kut Teh was when my flight back to Perth got delayed for 24 hours. I was beyond upset but there was nothing that I could do except enjoying the additional time in Singapore and thinking about it was better to be safe than sorry. So Efra and I decided to go and eat some bak kut teh.Sure enough, great food and great company really cured my annoyance of the delay :-)",

We were here for two on a Thursday night at 7pm and did not have to queue thankfully. By the time we were done at 815pm, there was a queue of about 15 people outside. So many people want to eat humble pork soup!We ordered before we sat down, and a server very efficiently sent out our order with her trusty iPad. We had the short ribs, offal, salted veggies, dough crullers, bean curd sheets, and barley water to drink. No complaints, standards were maintained. Broth was very peppery and sweet and porky. Free flow of soup, four refills we had! Cost about 30 for both of us. Would come back. Again and again and again. P.S. Offal here is cooked just slightly under, so the soup tends to get a bit red. Don't worry, it's all safe.",

It was also really crowded and they sat me outside where it was quite hot. As you can imagine, i was sweating buckets by the end of the meal, and my tongue was rather numb from the pepper.

I didn't know that it can be eaten with this method. Definitely very filling. It is located near Novena, the building is kinda dark though. Building beside are really old. I will definitely visit again and again for their good Bak Kut Teh. Hope that next time I visit again, the queue will not be too long too.",

Not really a big fan of the pepper kind. :)Well of course I've heard a lot about Founder's Bak Kut Teh and even more since social media has it showing the video of the American Ambassador trying and singing their praises. However as a local and a big time foodie, i'm disgraced to say that my first time trying it is even AFTER an American Ambassador has tried it! Anyways back to the review.... on a cold rainy Saturday night I decided to give it a go!Tons of celebrities photographs and newspaper cut outs exulting the food of this place shouted me from every wall. WHOA! It better be good then! Even late at night I had to queue behind 3-4 other people.I ordered one bowl for myself, salted veg, you tiao, pigs trotters and intestines. The soup was indeed lovely. You can really taste the clean & clear peppered pork infused broth all the way down to your tummy; you take a deep breath and the heat from the soup in your tummy escapes again through your mouth. FANTASTIC on a rainy day. But that's as far as I will say it goes!The pork rib I had was a little dry... it certainly stuck to the bone. Meat was a little tastless. I guess it all went into that delicious soup stock. The salted veg was not bad, but again, similar to many other places. Pigs Trotters was also not bad.. could be a taddd softer. Intestines were so-so too.I dunno... unlike others I just don't see the big deal about this place! hahah... Still loving my Klang style bkt! I guess to each his/her own!!",

Excited about that, he steered me to the entrance and proclaimed that we must eat here, as he's never seen this place without a queue.I was jet lagged (boo for passing out between 3 PM and 7 PM!) and hot (thanks, Equator) so I couldn't help but question why he is taking me to a place that was serving hot Chinese soup. Luckily, the joy experienced by my taste buds overshadowed my crankiness and grogginess due to oversleeping. I ended up really enjoying my meal!The peppery broth and the short ribs were fantastically paired with the fried bread that they give you on the side. This place has been here for ages, as the walls are covered with what I assume to be famous Asian actors and/or singers. Too bad I don't recognize anyone! Overall, great spot for anyone looking for some Chinese comfort food!",

Shortly after, Mediacorp used to bring their guests from overseas and hence there are tons of photos of famous stars including Chow Yuen Fatt, Emil Chau, etc decked throughout their walls. I'm still waiting for a George Clooney or Brad Pitt... come on Founders!Some people will argue between this and Songfa, but I personally prefer Founders.Recommendations:Pork Rib soup with rice of course. Accompanying dishes can go: dough fritters, soy sauce bean curd, salted vegetables, pork liver and kidneys (we dare you), soy sauce and vinegar pig trotters!Tips: Specify for the long pork-ribs, otherwise they will just give you the combination which isn't as satisfying. Sure it'll cost a dollar more, but well worth the extra meat and less messy bones. And if the soup isn't enough, just ask for a refill... it's free!Note: There is no gongfu tea here, so if you're coming here looking for that you will be disappointed. And the herbal teas and such are all in bubble-tea packaged forms, hence not brewed in the store.",

The peppery kick is awesome.There's generally a queue at most times but it moves quite fast (usually 15-20 mins). They also make you order while in the queue so you don't waste time after you've sit down. While the person managing the queue isn't that fluent in English, the menu has pictures so if you don't have a mandarin speaker handy you can just point. Convenient.For whatever reason, the pork in their basic bkt is usually quite tough so I'd recommend going for the prime rib bkt ($8 vs $6 I think). Beyond that I usually just get the usual sides - pickled vegetables, tau pok, youtiao - and everything is solid. They're also good with refilling the soup.",

    "text": "Along Balestier Rd, there are a number of Bak Kut Teh around and Founder Bak Kut Teh is one of the earlier ones that I have tired. You can recognise the store by its short stairs leading up to the store and once inside, you will find photos all pasted on the wall. These photos are photos of the boss taken with famous people that have eaten/ visited the place. There are two main type of Bak Kut Teh, one is the herbal type and one is the more pepper taste type. Founder Bak Kut Teh belong to the later one. People who are expect in Bak Kut Teh will know to order the prime ribs which will of cause cost abit more than the usual.The heavy taste of the soup is one of the reason why customers keep returning back to the place. Accompanied with fried you tiao (deep-fried bread sticks) dipped into the soup is the perfect combination.",
