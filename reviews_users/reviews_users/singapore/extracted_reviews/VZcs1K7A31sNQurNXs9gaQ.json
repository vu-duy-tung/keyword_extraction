    "text": "Nestled in the greenery and trees of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Food For Thought truly wins in terms of location. The atmosphere is quite nice as well, really green and casual with concrete floors, wooden tables and an open kitchen. On a Sunday afternoon expect to see many families with kids there, which makes for a loud, messy environment. I don't mind kids, I think they're really entertaining to watch, but I know some other reviewers complained that there were too many kids....The food was also very good! I've been getting a bit tired of hawker food, so I was willing to spend a little bit more to get a little taste of home. I ordered the grilled ham and cheese and roasted tomato salad, total was $13. The sandwich was served on ciabatta bread with greens and Dijon mustard vinigrette with sliced roasted ham and ooey goeey melty cheese (havarti, I think). I'm not sure if the sandwich was actually really good, or if I just missed bread and cheese so much that it didn't matter how good it was. I do think the sandwich could use more cheese- If I knew how little they would put I would have asked for extra, and been willing to pay for it. The roasted tomato salad was good, but not amazing. I was expecting grilled tomatoes on a plate seasoned with lemon and salt and pepper, but the dish was more like half of a sliced mushy tomato on a \u00a0bed of greens. It was okay, but I think the dish could use a better dressing and more tomatoes. Being the seasoned eater that I am I can frequently think of ways to make a dish better, but don't get me wrong, the food here is good.I think the cheapest item on the lunch menu is the chicken rendang S$ 9 and on the breakfast menu (served from 8:30-10:30?) is the mee rebus for S$ 5.One complaint I have is the people from the milkshake stand out front asked my friend and I three times if we wanted to buy a milkshake. The stand (some university partnership with FFT) is raising funds for children in Cambodia, which is a good cause and all, but I would have appreciated not being asked to buy a milkshake three times in a ten minute interval.If you're in the area definitely see the Botanic Gardens. Food For Thought makes a great reward for your long, sweaty walk though the gardens. :D",

    "text": "Food for Thought is a large restaurant in the basement of the Botanic Garden (not by the MRT side - you have to walk to the other end of the park, or can get here by driving and there is parking available). Serves the typical array of American breakfast foods, from eggs & hash browns to pancakes, some with an extra flare. Two people in my group had the chocolate and raspberry pancakes, which were delicious! I also loved the hash browns I ordered (which were like American tater tots). The other food were tasty too. We came here for brunch so we didn't try a lot of the lunch menu items. The one I did try-- the ratatouille -- was mediocre. The ambiance was casual.They get docked some stars because of the ordering system which is a little confusing. You have to order and pay at the counter, and give them your table number so they can deliver it to the right table when the food comes. We had to make sure someone was sitting at the table so that it wasn't taken. It was also pretty crowded and busy so the service wasn't the fastest (although it's mostly self-service so you have to be pretty proactive about asking the wait staff for what you need). But, overall, we enjoyed our time here and I would recommend it as a nice breakfast or brunch place before (or after) a day out at the Botanic Gardens!",

We'd read about the berry and chocolate pancakes on a blog post and decided they were a necessary addition to American-style eggs, toast and bacon and an order of chicken laksa. The pancakes were tasty but not particularly special for pancakes. The homemade brioche toast was a clear winner, as was the laksa. The lattes were perfect for cooling down after the humidity of the gardens. Overall, a perfect spot to grab a bite.",

Unlike the other restaurants in the botanical gardens, the atmosphere here is very relaxed and child-friendly. There's a playground outside and plenty of indoor space for kids to run around (they seem to throw good birthday parties, too).The food here was pretty good, albeit a little expensive. It's one of the only places I've found in Singapore that serves good quality, authentic Western food. For $20, I got a nice portion of grilled barramundi with basil pesto and a huge serving of mashed potatoes. The artisan burgers are nicely prepared too, at around $10, plus extra if you want drinks and fries. I also HIGHLY recommend the basil mayonnaise for $2 more. It was so good, we ate it with just about everything, even though it was intended to be eaten with just the fries!The drinks and desserts were nothing exciting, though, and rather pricey. A regular can of soda costs $3, and the specialty Pellegrino sodas are a bit more. The red velvet cake was the biggest disappointment of all. It was very dry and the frosting tasted like unsweetened cream cheese. Definitely not worth $6. Overall, eating here is a very pleasant experience, as the staff is very friendly and accommodating. The food comes out in a timely manner, and the waiters will wait to bring things out (i.e. dessert) until you want them to.",

    "text": "I came here one late Sunday morning for brunch. And sure enough, the crowd was thick. The problem with a popular place on a Sunday morning is getting seats and I believe they do not do reservations. So the troop of us, about 6 managed to squeeze ourselves on to a single small table in an odd corner of the place. The menu is a replicate of the one found in the other branch at Queen St. Nonetheless, the space and ambience fortunately makes up for the lack of a waiting staff. I would imagine that need to hire a lot more if they were to get people seated by waiters, the dining space is sprawling, indoors and out. The food, I had the works. And a beer on the side. Yes, Sunday morning beers. Heh. We had to line up at a counter to place our orders and pay for them at the same time. They advised that the food would be served in 30 minutes or less but in actual fact they came in about 10. Very fast and efficient I thought! The food was as expected, good. All in, a rather enjoyable Sunday morning for all us.",

They serve no frills comfort food at a pretty decent price. The branch in the Botanic Gardens is huge and it's a nice place to go for lunch or brunch after a walk in the park. They've got a wide array of desserts, Western and local mains, as well as breakfast. Most of their dishes have a cool local twist to it. I tried the banana pancakes which was served with gula Melaka syrup. I would come back here for sure for brunch.",

Location is within the grounds of the Singapore botanic gardens and has an interesting concept where you queue and order and then your food is delivered to your table - which are organized by number. There is indoor and outdoor seating as well as a nice but small play area for kids. Today we ordered the laksa, mee rebus, house breakfast, pancakes with chocolate, and a toddlers egg, bacon and toast combo. To drink long black, flat white, lime iced tea and rosemary blood orange juice. The OJ was particularly enjoyable.The food is reasonably priced, super fast and oozes a kid friendly vibe.The chocolate pancakes are my daughter's favorite, two large cakes with a generous portion of chocolate chips that melts as you spread it around!The eggs and bacon are pretty standard fare as was the laksa and rebus. Overall worth a visit and will be a place we frequent.",

    "text": "When I first heard that FFT had opened an outlet at Botanic Gardens, I was excited to check it out. Afterall, I was fond of its concept- a cause to support, breakfast components dissected to variable portions and trendy marketing: whats there not to love?Sad to say, I was disappointed both times when I went to visit. While the interior of the place is gorgeous (plants growing out of tables, mind you)- I found the ordering system counter-intuitive and user-unfriendly. The restaurant expects you to first find yourself a table, (have someone to) chope the seat, and queue at the ordering counter. When ordering, you are supposed to tell them exactly where you are seated (basically screwed if someone else takes your seat) or they will refuse to let you order until you have found an alternative seat. I can imagine what a hard time this would give single diners, or worse, having to split up lovey-eyed couples by forcing one to queue thereby subjecting them to a painful 20 minutes wait before they reunite! The 'choping' mechanism also makes me feel very ugly- I once had to tell someone with a crying baby on hand that basically all the seats around me were reserved. It is also very Singaporean, which surprises me, because Botanics is afterall a touristy place which attracts people whose culture might be vastly different from ours. I imagine this system to be completely indiscernible to them (I have seen foreigners bitch at staff over it).Even the food is not comparable to the other outlet. My scrambled eggs came too buttery, it was like drinking oil, but I didn't even feel like sending it back because it would possibly mean having to wait for another half an hour. The menu is also different from the other outlet's- so if you are thinking of heading to this one for a specific dish, remember to check the online menu before you make your trip down.",

Tried their basic breakfast ($9) and my friends got the full breakfast ($22) and their special of the day, banana walnut toast ($12). The banana walnut toast that came topped with yogurt was too sweet for my liking. The toast also tasted more like a muffin. The scrambled eggs and brioche were decent though. Not the best brunch place in town, but good for a casual catch up. Also appreciate the lack of GST and service charge. Coffee ($5) was out of the machine and not good at all.",

    "text": "Heard good reviews from my church mates for this place so decided to try it out with my friends. Was pretty empty on a Thursday night so we were able to choose the high chairs for our seat. As we were there for the first time, I wasn't really sure on where to order and asked one of the staffs about it. She directed us to the front where you can see the computer.Before making payments, what looked good to me was the Lemongrass Galangal Seafood Risotto. And of course, Milo Godzilla pudding for the dessert. My friends ordered the brunch platter for 2/3 pax and grilled barramundi fillet with holy basil almond pesto.Food came pretty earlier than what I expected. Mine came first and I started digging in without much hesitation. Was into risotto lately (hmmm).. My food has a strong aroma (which made me even hungrier than before) and the first bite, you can taste the different flavors bursting on your tongue. I love the touch of the ingredients especially the lemongrass condiments and the chilli inside the risotto. Overall, two thumbs up. The downside was that it was on the higher end and the portion wasn't big. Tried the brunch platter - it consist quite a variety (seen on the picture). I always crave for good fries and the fries have a crispy touch on it. I tried hashbrowns and the lemon dill fish fingers has fresh peach on it. The Crispy Chicken Tortilla was also good. All of them has perfect touch of condiments/sauces in them which made the taste last inside the mouth. The grilled barramundi filet wasn't that wow. For the Milo Godzilla pudding, I was searching for \"rare\" desserts and this one caught my eye straightaway even before my friend announced that she would like to order one portion too. Like a molten lava cake, it has ice cream on top (coconut flavored if I wasn't wrong) and chocolate cake at the bottom. The chocolate cake was moist. I am glad that we ordered just one dessert as we couldn't probably finish if we have more.Interior design wasn't too fancy. Open concept kitchen and open concept layout with some modern touches on its furnitures. Price like I mentioned, it is on the higher end but since it is located at one of the touristy places - Botanical Gardens, price range for me was al-right. Will be back for more in the future :)",

    "text": "Food For Thought always hold a special place in my palate... the all day breakfast and pancakes are always so delectable.The food offering at the Botanical Gardens outlet is slightly different from the one at their restaurant at 8Q but it's equally tasty. For first timers the ordering system may be a little confusing cos it's mainly self service and the wait staff are mainly there to help serve the orders instead of taking orders at the table. Utensils, water etc are also to be taken by patrons themselves.Since this restaurant is much larger than the outlet at 8Q and the atmosphere is supposed to be a lot more casual and relaxing, this \"do-everything-at-your-own-pace\" system is pretty alright. Finding a seat first may be challenging on a crowded day but hey, lighten up and enjoy the smell of nature! You are afterall, in the Botanic Gardens! :)However, the place depends a lot on natural lighting thus it may get a little dim when the sky is cloudy. The lights used are mainly spot lights at the area where the long tables are, thus it may also get a little warm. Understand your own preference and choose your seats wisely, I'm sure the overall experience will still be enjoyable.",

Its spacious, bright interior is welcoming and cheery, with floor to ceiling glass panels and a high roof. There is even a little playground just outside the restaurant, so this place is popular with families on weekends.They serve all day breakfast here from 8am to 5pm, and even give early birds a local black coffee or tea offer at $1 when you order local breakfast items between 8am-10am.There's the Full Works breakfast pieces at $18, and it comes with scrambled eggs, bacon, buttered toast, chicken sausage, hash brown, garlic mushrooms and a toasted tomato salad. Nothing mind blowing, but it's definitely a hearty breakfast! They bake their own pastries and desserts here, and I ordered an old southern red velvet cake for $6. The cake was dry and unpalatable, with a weird cardboard aftertaste.However I was pleasantly surprised when I brought the cake back. The staff were very apologetic and offered to exchange it for any other dessert, making recommendations for me as well. I chose the passion fruit curd cheesecake, which was quite heavy and but tasty and kept me quite happy. Decent coffee is served here, bit when it gets really hot, I order a fresh juice or a San pelligrino to cool off.I've yet to try the lunch and dinner menu, but would definitely be back for more!",

Yes, we Singaporeans are so dependent on the wonders of air-conditioning. Okay I am so dependent on the wonders of air-conditioning.So back to the space. It's big. And it feels a little too big sometimes, especially when you have to wander around to: a) order your food, b) collect your utensils, c) find a seat. Almost like a school canteen on your first day... but thankfully the food is better here. Check out the lunch time specials - great deals there, but of course there are lots of other tasty options.

This is a semi self-service system where you order and pay at the cashier and then the food gets served to you at your table. Even though it's pretty big, but it takes a while to get a table and then a little more to get your food. I prefer the sit down service at 8Q because at least i don't have to stand around to grab tables a la food court style. However, Botanic wins in terms of space and the close proximity to nature. Take your pick.Food is pretty much the same. Customize your own breakfast set with their creamy scrambled eggs (must order). FfT has one of the better scrambled eggs around because they actually use cream in theirs to give it that runny and buttery texture. I would say skip the Toasts unless you really need carbs. Their spreads are really pathetic though.What you should not miss out on is the pancakes. 2 Buttermilk base Pancakes served with Fresh Cream and Gula Melaka Syrup with the choice of different flavors such as Banana and Walnuts, Milk Chocolate, Dark Choc and Raspberries etc. Prices range from S$8 to $12.",

Oh and there's free Wi-Fi.A satisfying bread and butter pudding can be had for a mere $6ish, drenched in milky vanilla over it. This always makes my day.(Electronic) parking is ample in the underground Botanical gardens carpark, which means rain or shine, you're covered from your car all the way to your pudding. The fact that the restaurant/cafe is next to a children's playground and surrounded by greenery with sun shining in makes it that much more pleasing to dine in. Every table has a hole shaped in it for potted plants, and the lights overhead are fashioned from tins. I love just about everything about this place.Food for Thought does not charge for service, GST is already included in the listed prices so what you see on the menu is what you pay. So if you dig their service, remember to leave a tip, or choose to donate $2 when you take a glass of free clean water, so an African can be blessed with the same for a year.Cool cafe with a great concept.

You can choose to sit indoor or take the out door seats. For us, after a long walk and all sweaty, we went ahead with siting inside without thinking. Orders have to be made at the counter. To speed up the ordering process, the restaurant have two ordering counters.The food were average but the ambience was great.

    "text": "Having been to the spacey, tastefully and artfully decorated Food For Thought @ 8Q, some expectations were set for their rather new Botanic Gardens venture... so after a good 25-minute trek through the Botanic Gardens (my gal pal and I entered from the Bukit Timah Gate, much to our dismay), we arrived in a large, spacious, forest-y restaurant with a large variety of different sized tables (imagine a small table coupled with high stools, and next to it, a giant table with 8-10 chairs)! They were working on the AC indoors so it didn't bring us much relief from the heat (and exercise), but I hope it's done now!Exciting!They do the all-day brunch (as with their other branches), and my gal pal got the scrambled eggs with mushrooms & toast, and I went and ordered the Iced Earl Grey Tea with Milk (exhausted from the trek before). I had a nibble of her food (thank goodness for small appetites!) and found the scrambled eggs to be really fluffy and deliciouso, and the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms to be the highlight - salty, bursting with flavour and juice, and uber fragrant! If you're getting the all-day brunch, I'd highly recommend the mushrooms.My drink however, was sub-par and disappointing, and with the $4.50 price tag, it was something I could have done at home - dunk a tea bag in hot tea and heavily dilute it with milk, then pour it on ice. I'd definitely come back, but I wouldn't get the Iced Tea. That's a no-no.",
