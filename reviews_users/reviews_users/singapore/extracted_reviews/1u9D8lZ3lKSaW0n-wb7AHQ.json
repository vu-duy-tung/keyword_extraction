    "text": "La salsa is located at 11 Dempsey road, away from bus stops and mrts'. So bring a car or include taxis on your budget. Live band performance starts at 10pm and ends at midnight. Good thing Nick has a good voice and band, what he lacks in movement and audience interaction is compensated by his effortless singing. When my friends told me we are having a mexican friday night out. What comes to mind is songs like (Besame Mucho, or fast dance song with people wearing big hats, flowy flowery dress Etc) but the band play songs of sam smith, jessie j, adam levine etc. Two thumbs for their performance. The place is not big but just right to enjoy. They have wide selection of drinks and foods. I tried mai tai and quesadilla and nachos. And wow \"The best nachos ever!\" Can't help but have second servings. The staff are friendly and very attentive.",

We arrived, were seated in the middle of the restaurant and ignored the entire evening. After 20 minutes, we had to pull someone aside to take our orders. There clearly wasn't a server assigned to our table as our drinks rested at the bar behind us, and we ended up choosing to grab them ourselves. The food came out cold. One member of our party didn't receive his food until the rest of us had finished. All the while servers walked about and ignored our efforts to get their attention. No consideration for experience here. Won't be coming back.",

The restaurant has a nice ambience with a friendly and efficient staff to boot.My only complaint would be that our meals came out at different times. A minute or so would be fair. \u00a0However, there was an unpleasant stretch of time between our meals being delivered to the table. Not a typical Mexican pairing and being a lover of Moscato, I had Moscato (in which I was a bit shocked to see on the menu) and the chicken chimichanga. \u00a0Both were delightful.",

    "text": "This is a review of dinner with colleagues at La Salsa.tinyurl.com/a7uzgsuThe ambiance, while not extravagantly so, did have leanings towards Mexican decor. \u00a0It has an open and airy feel to it. \u00a0It is also quite colourful.tinyurl.com/ahwzu6qThe staff was friendly and professional. \u00a0Throughout the meal, the service was timely.There were no complimentary chips and salsa. \u00a0For a full service Mexican restaurant, this is a fail. \u00a0If you are going to charge $20 to $30 (and beyond) for relativity average Mexican entrees, there should be nice warm chips and salsa on every table.Tacos - My colleagues ordered beef tacos and chorizo tacos. \u00a0They then shared them so that they all had some of each. \u00a0They looked appetizing. \u00a0My colleagues seemed to enjoy them. \u00a0They were well presented but had too much lettuce.tinyurl.com/ard63rlSteak Fajitas - This was my main. \u00a0The meat was tender and they were very generous with the amount of steak provided. \u00a0It also had a nice mix of seasonings. \u00a0They were super stingy with the condiments though. \u00a0There was barely enough of each for one fajita taco, much less four. \u00a0Also, the quality of the condiments was very low. \u00a0 No one in Mexico would make baby puke guacamole like that. \u00a0It was bland, bland, and bland. \u00a0 The salsa wasn't much better than Tostito's, straight out of a jar.if they want to contact me, I will show them how to make real guacamole and salsa.This is what \u00a0salsa & guacamole should look like - tinyurl.com/ar6ektyThey also did not provide any beans and/or rice with the fajitas, epic fail!The steak saved this dish. \u00a0Because, in the end, meat on a tortilla is pretty good. \u00a0 But the lack of condiments and sides definitely detracted from the overall fajita experience.These were the most expensive fajitas I've ever eaten and not even close to being the best.Fajita Steak - tinyurl.com/ajebtrtFajita Condiments (what there is of them) - tinyurl.com/awo878zReceipt ($116.52)For Mexican food, this was a pretty pricey meal for 4 people. \u00a0If they hadn't been stingy with some key ingredients, I would not have an issue with the cost. \u00a0The food just didn't quite live up to it though.tinyurl.com/a842829Overall - La Salsa has a nice room and the service was solid. \u00a0The food was inconsistent. \u00a0There were weaknesses in some core ingredients. \u00a0There were aspects missing. \u00a0In other cases, they were not very generous with portions. \u00a0 This could have easily went either way. \u00a0With a few more weaknesses, it would have been a two star review. \u00a0With a little more thought into the food, it could have been a four star experience. \u00a0I am splitting the two and leaving it as a three star review.",

Must have been taken off the menu due to lack of popularity which seems crazy... Who wouldn't want a Mexican style hotdog!?",
