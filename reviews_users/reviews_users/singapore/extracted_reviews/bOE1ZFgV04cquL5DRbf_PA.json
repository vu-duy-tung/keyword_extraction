A scalding hot, peppery pork broth that is bottomless. Dunk fried Chinese bread (you tiao) into your soup, and let those guys float around and absorb the broth. Devour. Repeat. Though gray meat is certainly not much for the visual appeal, the taste here is out of control. I promise you won't have any regrets with this one!",

    "text": "Bak Kut Teh is always a great comfort food after a late night activity. Having just attended an event at Zouk, the famished stomach was looking for some comforting thus we turned to Ya Hua Bak Kut Teh.While the peppery soup did a pretty good job warming up the tummy, the pieces of meat werent as pleasurable. It felt a little too dry for me (personally prefer it with slightly more fat) and it wasnt that easy to bite it off the bone.The interesting thing about the soup is, though it's actually pretty good, it does taste slightly different upon each refill. Sometimes it's more peppery and flavourful, sometimes it tastes almost like hot water. It's generally not a very crowded restaurant but people do consistently stream in for their meal. Not a bak kut teh that's top of my list but it's good enough to just get the tummy filled for the night.",

Sounds good to me! BKT is the best nighttime comfort food in Singapore for sure. Just had a meal here on a drizzly Thursday night since we were in the area. The BKT broth was simmered to garlicky perfection, but the pork ribs were too lean and tough at some parts for my tastes. Meanwhile, the salted veg that we ordered was really good - I had an extra portion of rice to finish it up! All in all it was a satisfying meal that definitely hit the spot. A meal for the three of us cost $29, which was very reasonable. I will be back!",

Not that its bad, but conveniently located near Zouk, Ya Hua is the ideal place to sober up after a night of partying. The clear pepper broth is both refreshing and flavourful and combined with the succulent and tender prime ribs, makes it a meal fit for a king. As I'm not a fan of innards, I can only base on what my friends who consume it tell me, and that it's the best they've had. You don't have to be a fan of the peppery type of bak kut teh to enjoy this delicious bowl of soup. That's how good it is.",
