    "text": "On Duxton Hill there are some pretty decent wine options. This tapas place should primarily be visited for their wine list - don't get me wrong their tapas are pretty good (favorites include the pan con tomate as well as the chorizo) \u00a0as well but the main reason I come here is the wine.They have a good selection of wines by the glass. They usually have a cava from really excellent producer Agusti Tor\u00e9llo by the glass as well as champagne from Delamotte (for those who do not know this is the 'sister' winery of Salon and the fifth oldest champagne house). In addition they usually also have at least 3 white, 3 red and 1 ros\u00e9 wine by the glass as well. All wines are usually solid choices and while it may not be cheap it is decent value for money and it is clear they know their wines.The staff are usually very friendly and most of them are good with wine recommendations. The place can get pretty packed in the later part of the evening and pretty loud so prefer coming here pretty early.",

    "text": "For big eaters (guilty flush comes to my face), Sabio offers the best value in quality tapas in Singapore on Sundays!Show up early if you have a big group or pull up a couple of stools at the long bar and be prepared to stuff your little bellies with free flow hot and cold tapas for 49.90 (+20 for free flow cava and sangria).Among our favorite items on the menu are:1. Churros: crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside and served with dark chocolate sauce on the side2. Sizzling Prawns: the classic tapas dish, with flawless execution (I can personally eat two orders)3. Ham Croquettes: the plain cheese croquettes are good, but I think the ham version is even more delicious4. Oysters: nothing makes a Sunday afternoon feel more luxe than a dozen oysters paired with sparkling wine5. Pan Fried Calamares: almost as delicious as the sizzling prawns, simply done in a small colorful frying pan 6. Spanish Cheese Plate: of course, El Queso Grande loves the free flow cheese platter, manchego is his favorite cheese of allPARTING THOUGHT: bring your glutton, but leave the assholes at home... We've seen bad patrons over order and waste the delicious food! \u00a0Sabio had to start charging for wastage as a result! \u00a0Order a few tapas each round and relax and pace yourself!",

    "text": "2nd time here and the experience has been good. The tapas portions are generally small so 1-for-1 tapas Monday is really a great deal with a larger portion at the same price! *note: 1-for-1 tapas deal applies to the same tapas dish ordered and excludes cold cuts. The seafood hot tapas are generally flavorful except for the Octopus. There's something about the Octopus seasoning/gravy that just doesn't sit well with our palette. The scallops are a must-order in my opinion. To end off, throw in a serving of churros, served warm (and crispy), with a rich bittersweet chocolate sauce - heavenly!Seats may be hard to get as it gets later in the evening so do head down early to get a nice table.",

    "text": "Sabio Tapas Bar is a gem hidden along the Duxton stretch. The deco at this wine bistro is most inviting, with walls decorated with eclectic motifs, a long table and many seats in various permutations. We ordered white and red sangria ($10) which did not taste too strongly of brandy, and was tasty because of an adequate amount of fruit juice and sugar. It was sweet, and tasted a bit like fruit punch with alcohol. Their wine comes from vending machines, and you can choose if you want a tasting portion, half a cup or a whole cup. They also serve a wide range of Tapas. The menu is divided into four parts: Cold Tapas ($6-19), Jamon & Chorizo ($8-25), Hot Tapas ($8-18) and desserts ($6-8). As we were there for a late night drink , we didn't try the Tapas. Would certainly pop by another day to give it a shot as the description on the menu makes the food sound glorious.",

    "text": "Sabio, located in the increasingly hip Duxton area, is a bar I go to when I want a cheap pint of beer when I'm hanging out in the area. A pint of Hoegaarden goes for $12, and you'll be hard pressed to find a bar in the area which serves beer at a cheaper price. Their specialty though has to be their sangria - they serve both white and red versions, with the former being especially refreshing to drink when Singapore's weather is being muggy and difficult. Sabio has a latin feel, often playing irresistible Spanish songs which leave your feet tapping unconsciously. The decor is tastefully done up with black and white wall paper. I've even brought friends from overseas there and have them remarked that the bar makes them feel like they are in Miami!One drawback about Sabio however has to be their seats. The outdoor seats are nothing more than stools, and the front half of the bar is given over to strange semi-booth like tables which force you to position yourself in an awkward spot if you wish to talk to a friend face to face. That being said though, the vibe and cheap drinks more than make up for these minor inconveniences",

Call it lounging or socializing, this place has a beautiful crowd every evening. People aside, Sabio is a great place to get your Sangria or the ever popular Leffe Blonde beer on tap for a very reasonable price of $8 a glass. When you're first seated, a small complimentary portion of tapas is given to you to give you a taste of things to come if you do decide to try the tapas. I only ever had one tapas dish there that was really expensive, it was the shaved Aged Corn-fed Black Iberian Pork. I can tell you for sure the complex name justifies the fantastic flavor! There is no better way to end a work week with drinks, great food and great people!",

The gambas pil pil (prawns in olive oil and garlic) was also pretty tasty and the embutidos mixtos, a selection of Spanish ham, sausages, and cheese was a huge hit. The patatas aioli (fried potatoes with garlic mayonnaise) was deliciously addictive though the pork with saffron was a tad on the tough side.Ambience : A great vibe for drinks and tapas ... love the decor and overall ambience. The seats at the bar were a bit cramped though, leg room was insufficient so we had to sit side waysService : Great!Sabio doesn't take reservations so advisable to go early or very late",

Straight forward no frills tapas here, nothing fancy, just straight forward classic tapas items. That shouldn't let that put you off though, cause after numerous visits the food has always been spot on and well executed. Nothing can be more satisfying than 50g of iberico de bellota shaved off the bone in front of you while you sit at the bar. The bacalao is quite simply the best I've had in Singapore. Staff are knowledgeable about product, which is exactly what you'll need if your not familiar with Spanish tapas concepts or items. \u00a0This place wont burn a whole in your pocket either, great Spanish tapas, In a very European inspired fit out, all in the easy central location of Duxton Hill.
