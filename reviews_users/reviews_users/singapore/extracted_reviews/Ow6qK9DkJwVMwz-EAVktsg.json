Great photo spot and apparently you can also make reservations as we saw multiple people come in with reservations. It's located right in front of the entrance of Suntec City Mall - the mall is huge so ask for directions if you get lost!They also have desserts to go and also cute little trinkets you can buy to go home if you so want to. The place is adorable for pics once again!",

    "text": "If you're a fan of Gudetama, then this cafe is for you! Located inside of the Suntec City Mall, you'll be squealing both internally and externally as you come across the cute storefront and then are led inside where there are Gudetama-adorned booths, egg shell chairs, and a plethora of Gudetama faces all over the walls and even ceiling!The menu consists of basic savory fare - eggs benedict, waffles, fries, salad, a burger, and more - and dessert - cheesecake, chocolate cake, pudding, milkshakes, etc. Each item is somehow Gudetama-themed, whether it be with an actual egg item or a Gudetama face on something else. I ordered the Ta-Ma-Go ($17.9 SGD), which were sweet mini cheesecakes deceptively shaped like savory tamago nigiri with a matcha paste (\"wasabi\") and syrup (\"soy sauce\") on the side. There were 4 cakes and each was topped with a little piece of toasted cake with Gudetama's face, covered in little rice krispies, and wrapped in a black fondant \"seaweed\" strip. While it was cute, it wasn't QUITE as nice as the photo in the menu, and didn't have a lot of flavor except for the actual cheesecake. The boyfriend ordered the Mooooo Fries ($18.5 SGD), which were sweet potato fries covered with cheese, bulgogi and an egg. It was surprisingly a decent portion and the bite I tasted was pretty good. He finished it and actually felt reasonably full afterwards. Service was a bit...below average on our visit. After we requested a few more minutes to peruse the menu before ordering, no one ever came back so we had flag someone down - with much difficulty as the cafe was FAR from busy but none of the employees were looking in our direction. We had to ask for water. It would've also been nice to be able to choose where we sat since one of the adorable Gudetama booths was open but we were sat at a regular table instead. We did receive some Gudetama-shaped cookies after paying which was a nice souvenir, though!Overall, it's a fun place to visit for the novelty and to take photos of and with everything, but probably not worth a second visit due to overpriced, decent but average food and subpar service. I did particularly enjoy the complimentary basket of hard boiled eggs - with bright yellow yolks just like eating Gudetama himself!",

Ambience: 5/5- attention to detail is everything here as chairs are eggshells, the tables are sunny side up eggs, the ceilings even have gudetama. Food: 3.5/5- with any cute restaurant, the compromise is usually the taste. I got the Big Nua Breakfast and it was decent but nothing amazing. You honestly just go for the photos. The price point also would deter you from coming back. Service: 4/5- not the most attentive, but very very sweet!",

The restaurant had 2 dining area : the main one with the items display for sale and a smaller one in garden theme. As we were early and there was not much customers around, only the main dining area was opened. We had our choice of seat and decided on one of the egg shaped booth table. If you were in a big group, there was a table shaped like a egg tray with eggs in it. So cute.\"I'm Cold\" Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict ($26.90++)Poached eggs covered with smoked salmon. Drizzled with signature zesty hollandise sauce complete with mashed avocado, ebiko and tater tots.The dish was served in a rather heavy frying pan. It was so cute having the eggs covered with the salmon slices. Looked rather cosy. The simple looking dish was not bad and quite filling too. One could barely finished it.Shoyu Ramen ($21.50++)Shoyu Ramen made with chocolate cake, chestnut Mont Blanc and Earl Grey Jelly.Served with a side of panna cotta and sweetened rose tea.The dish looked very nice. While the cake was moist, hidden under the layer of jelly, one could not taste the chestnut in it. The panna cotta was creamy. The rose tea was lightly flavoured, that the flavour was not distinct. Finished the meal with Butterscotch Latte ($6.90++) and Matcha Latte ($6.90++) which both tasted rather average.As it was Easter weekend, there was free boiled eggs on the table to help oneself to.",

Wrong. First of all, the prices were outrageous. Absolutely shocking actually. The food was not the best quality at all. Not even close. There are SO many things you could make with eggs. I think they could have totally had an amazing menu. So let's just pretend the little Gudetama faces weren't on the food... well it tasted like something I wouldn't even pay $5 for. The breakfast meal had simple fried egg on top of a SOGGY bread. The salad was simple and the beans are 100 percent straight from a can. Nothing about this is special. The pizza was nothing special at all. Let's just say that appearances in this case are deceiving. The staff was not the most pleasant either. When asked if we could have regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries that one of the dishes is made with, the answer was no. And a blank stare. Literally no sorry or anything. Awkward. And when asked if we can take the paper placemats for keepsake, the answer was also no. I mean, it's PAPER. The only thing this place is good for like I said, is the novelty of it. I would definitely say this was far from eggcellent. Too bad I got too eggcited. By the way, this is no eggzaggeration. I give it a solid one star.",
