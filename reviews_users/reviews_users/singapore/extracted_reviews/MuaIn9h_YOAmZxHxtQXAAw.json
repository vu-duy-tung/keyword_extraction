It came with fries too and damn was that a good meat or what!The second time we went we ordered Giant \"Cote De Boeuf\" (prime rib) for 2 persons. If you are going with another person, I would recommend ordering it if you don't mind sharing. It's a big portion, just enough for 2. The meat was perfectly cooked for a medium rare, topped of with rock salt. Came with free flow of fries and they were yummy.",

Yeah this place wont be on your list of places to eat. \u00a0But its worth it. \u00a0We came here for a birthday dinner. \u00a0Its not a huge place so it wasnt so easy to fit 6 and this was a Monday night. If you have a group make a reservation. \u00a0The atmosphere is nice and intimate. \u00a0The escargot was great. Came out of the shell with tons of butter to eat after with bread. \u00a0The house wine was reasonable at $48 a bottle. \u00a0The service not too bad. They helped us do a little something at the end for the birthday girl. \u00a0Now onto the steak. \u00a0I mean thats why youre most likely going there. I dont remember what else was on the menu because I didnt really look. \u00a0Its reasonably priced for a steak in Singapore and well prepared. \u00a0You can get a sauce on the side if you like and it comes with free flow fries and they are nice and crispy. \u00a0It also comes with a salad to cut the grease a little. \u00a0My friend and I ordered the behemoth 1kg prime rib aka the colon killer. \u00a0 It was huge and very good. \u00a0This isnt cut so youre not getting that quality of meat but it is very good and I enjoyed it. \u00a0I'd definitely come back again",

Beef marrow was tasteless and overwhelming; the escargots was drenched in oil and saut\u00e9ed with herbs n such, but I couldn't taste any herbs!The main was passable. We got the 1kg Prime rib for two. The steak was huge, but it doesn't seemed aged. We asked for it rare, but I couldn't find any traces of blood in it. Overall the steak was slightly dry and mild for my liking.Generally will not return to this restaurant again.",

It's not bad but not great either,Firstly $16 for a Heineken pint from the tap is insane and they only have the one beer!?!Entree and cold platters also are nothing to write home about.Mains though it does pick up a little. I did order the tenderloin which was the most expensive cut ($42 main)but was worth it even if it was on the small side. Downside I ordered medium-rate and my friend ordered medium-well done. When they delivered they mixed them up!The sauces are actually the saviour though, really good and compliment the dish well Wine relatively well priced for Singapore",

    "text": "This is a review of a group lunch (four people) at Les Bouchons at Ann Siang Road.tinyurl.com/d9hbfhdWe went there to try their Friday/Saturday couscous special. \u00a0It was worth the trip. At least two of us did and the other two decided they were up for it.The room is quite comfortable. \u00a0It has a home-like feel to it. \u00a0It is also pretty much as close to the feel of \u00a0a small French restaurant as you are likely to find in Singapore.tinyurl.com/ct2cczaThey do also have a few outdoor seats.tinyurl.com/c4xega7They open at noon and were soon filled to the brim. \u00a0I think everyone had a reservation. \u00a0So, I would suggest doing the same. \u00a0It Is not a large room.The service was very good. \u00a0They didn't seem to mind that one of our party was a bit late and we wanted to wait for the full group to order. \u00a0The staff was polite without being overly friendly. \u00a0The meal flowed at a nice pace. \u00a0This felt a bit more like dinner though than lunch. \u00a0I wouldn't necessarily suggest it for a quick lunch. We ordered the \u00a0couscous special for four. \u00a0This is a lot of food. \u00a0There is the couscous plate that comes with couscous, chicken, lamb skewer, and sausage. \u00a0It is set up so that each person gets a full portion of each meat. \u00a0Everything I ate on the plate was very good. \u00a0It was a true pleasure. \u00a0The lamb seemed to be very popular but I enjoyed it all. \u00a0It had the deep flavours that can only come with time. \u00a0As you can see by the photo, there was lots, and I mean lots, of food.tinyurl.com/bryynhfThere was also a basket of bread. \u00a0I really enjoyed the bread. \u00a0It was a rustic French bread. \u00a0It was very hearty and took to the butter extremely well.tinyurl.com/dx32rppThen there was the big huge pot of hearty vegetable stew. \u00a0This is the kind of stew my mom used to make. \u00a0Heck, it is the kind off stew I sometimes make. \u00a0You know the one that is perfect comfort food for a rainy day. \u00a0There were huge chunks of carrots and potatoes and such. \u00a0The broth was delicious.tinyurl.com/cwsf5v4There was also a small bowl of chickpeas and some condiments.tinyurl.com/cc88yz4tinyurl.com/cnc5wknI just want to say that the food was simply good. \u00a0All of it was good. \u00a0This is the kind of meal that I could eat any day. It is the kind of warm and comforting meal that almost makes one wish that Singapore had winter. \u00a0Because it would be perfect for warming the body after traipsing through the snow.I do not know the cost. \u00a0I did not pay the check and we didn't really look at the menu. \u00a0We knew what we were ordering.Overall - The service was good. \u00a0The room is very comforting. \u00a0The food was wonderful and plentiful. \u00a0One lucky colleague took home what looked like at least a very filling dinner. \u00a0I know Les Bouchons' speciality is Steak Frites. \u00a0But, I think it is well worth it to seek out a Friday or Saturday and try their couscous special. \u00a0I just thought it was a very good meal.",

    "text": "I've been to Les Bouchons many years ago and I remember their steak-frites being absolutely delicious. I am not sure why, but I have not been back in a very long time. So last night, JML and I decided to have dinner there.The restaurant decor and ambiance is nice and it reminds me a lot of the bistros you find in France. Small, cozy and casual. I like that!We ordered the Entrec\u00f4te and the Assiette with lamb, merguez and sauce Harissa. Both dishes are served with a bowl of salad and fries.The salad was nice with a delicious Moutarde de Meaux dressing.The fries were \u00a0perfectly cooked with a great crunchiness to them.However the meats we ordered were so disappointing!... The entrec\u00f4te (ribeye in French) was cooked medium rare like we ordered but the steak was of poor quality or of a bad cut, we believe. It didn't have much taste and it was not at all tender nor juicy. Maybe the heat of the grill wasn't at the right temperature which is very important to have a delicious, tender, juicy steak... We were quite surprised since this place is known for their steak-frites!...The lamb skewer was over cooked so the meat was hard and so was the merguez. Too bad because the merguez had a nice taste.So our experience with the meats at Les Bouchons has been very poor. Maybe we were not lucky that night and the Chef had a bad day and did not cook with \"love\". Who know...? I certainly hope so because if this is considered a good steak house by many, there are better places I can recommend ;-)For the service however, I give it 2 thumbs up! The 2 girls were very pleasant. The oldest of the 2 was very professional and it's nice to see that! JML and I always make it a point that when we find a dish served in a restaurant not good because of the quality or cooking method, to mention it (in a polite way of course and explaining why hehehe) because we believe that a positive or negative feedback is important for an establishment. Why say it's good when it is not?!?! Anyway, she responded in a very professional manner and it was very much appreciated. It was nice to hear a polite and educated response compare to the usual I am lost, panicking reaction \"Heuuu.... Heuuu... I don't know. Heuuu let me check\" (then the disappearing act) that you usually get in Singapore.Service: Bravo!Ambiance: I like!Food: Meh... Maybe we'll try it again in a few months to give it a second shot.",

And felt quite sick thereafter, though it was in no way the fault of LB, but rather my system rebelling against a sudden influx of red meat. I've patronised LB many, many times thereafter, this being my absolute favourite steakhouse for a great meal at a reasonable price.The ambience is dim and relaxed, and everyone is obviously unwinding after a long day. It's not a hoity toity hush hush restaurant, neither is it deafeningly loud. Everything is just right, and while the service is not in the least friendly, servers are prompt and get the job done. The rib eye medium rare is the star of the show. You know how sometimes places don't do their steaks properly, and if you want a medium, you'll have to order a medium rare because it always comes overcooked? Not LB. Order a medium rare and that's what you'll get. A beautifully seared slab of meat, succulent and the insides sufficiently bloody, just the way I like it. And it's a sizable slab too - I never have space to finish the fries, let alone order a second serve. The carafes are reasonably priced too, and go beautifully with the meal. Reservations are necessary - there's no point rocking up without a booking because you'd be turned away since it's a tiny spot and always full.",

    "text": "I like this Les Bouchons more than the one by the riverside in Robertson Quay. It's got a better vibe and better food.Set in a quiet corner of Ann Siang Hill, one comes to Les Bouchons for Parisien-style steak frites. I honestly think this is the best steak one can get at the $30-something price point. It doesn't really taste like a mid-range steak; it's of far higher quality.I go for the ribeye all the time. With a slab of beautiful butter on it, it's quite perfect. Having a carafe of wine to go with it makes it even better. There's also a good selection of starters and desserts which are quite good, but the steaks clearly are the stars of the show.Service however can be quite spotty. It's been quite difficult to make a reservation without calling repeatedly (and you NEED a reservation, because seating is so limited). It's a good place to go to with good friends or to have a causal dinner date with someone special. For that reason it's been my place to go to for quite a while now!",

    "text": "Went here after googling \"steak frites Singapore\" since I was craving for that simple but great dish (if correctly made) during my last visit. After reading few reviews, I decided to go try this place without any reservations during Friday lunch hours, I figured that I'd just go eat somewhere in Chinatown if I couldn't find a seat. Suprisingly, they were able to seat me and my friends right away on the last 2 available seats. The restaurant itself is pretty small and it's kinda hidden in alleyway behind the busy S Bridge Rd. Being Friday, both of us had a hard time to decide between the steak frites, which is the specialty here, or the couscous royal (another specialty only available on Friday and Saturday) since both are frequently mentioned on the reviews. Finally, considering that we have to split the couscous if we ordered that due to the portion (for 2), we decided just to get the steak frites since both of us was craving for good steak before deciding to go here. I got the ribeye with Vigneron butter and needless to say, it very well did not disappoint - the butter, which is an important part of a steak frites went really well with the ribeye, just the right amount of saltiness. The price for the steak frites wasn't cheap by any countries' standards, but you definitely got what you pay for. I'll definitely try to come back whenever I'm at Singapore to try the couscous or get my fix of good steak frites. Reservation is recommended for this place due to the limited seatings.",
