The rude woman just waved and the staff showed the 3 of them to a table, bypassing us. When I proceed indoor to take the last table, the staff made us to take the outdoor table which was pretty hot given it was noon time and there was no fan blowing outside whereas indoor there's fans on. Reason given that we were 2 persons, whereas the other groups got 3 persons. What kind of treatment was this! Yet when I was paying I could spot guys of 2 taking the tables for 4 indoor.Bad experience!Don't come here for small groups!",

    "text": "Decent Prices for Average Food. There's something about Thai food that captivates everyone. Whether it's the over the top, burn your mouth off chilli or that combination of flavours that evokes all your senses at once, Thai food never fails to warm your heart and make you crave for more. Being a regular at Holland Village, we've seen the super long queues for Nakhon Kitchen and it's always made us wonder just how good the food is. We finally had the chance to try when, amazingly, there were less than 10 people in the queue. Waiting time was around 15 mins considering that most people had wanted to sit indoors instead of outside in the sweltering hit. Having a few favourite thai joints, we had to try some of our favourites. Tom Ka Chicken Soup ($6) Unlike most people who go on the search for the best Tom Yum soup, I love my Tom Ka. I love myself a god Tom yum but Tom Ka elevates that sour tanginess with the rich, smooth, sweetness of the coconut milk. There's was a good portion of chicken and mushroom and while it offered that tangy kick, it was a little light on the coconut milk. While it gave it that milky colour, the sweetness and richness of the coconut milk didn't shine through as much. Pineapple Curry with Mussels ($8)The one thing I admire about thai curries is their ability to use fresh fruits into their curry, adding that extra level of sweetness to compliment to spiciness and sourness. The curry here was pretty nice, thicker than I expected but really spicy and Because of that spiciness, it didn't really do much for the mussels. While the mussels were large and fresh, they didn't add a lot of flavour into the curry and vice versa. Maybe because there were only 5 mussels. Ironically, when I took the dish home, added in some coconut milk and cooked it with fish, it turned out to be a very good fish curry. Stir fried Kai Lan with mushrooms ($6)Kai Lan was not overcooked, which was nice. Mushroom, sliced, were juicy but the overall dish was just a bit too salty for me. I love the use of thai oyster sauce in vegetables, I use it a lot too in mine but this was just too heavy on the sauce. Thai Iced Tea ($3)This had to be the biggest let down for me. At $3, it was probably the most diluted or weak thai iced tea I've had. Overall, the food was decent but at the prices, I could see why they were so popular. Unfortunately for me, it really felt like the crowds were there more for the price than for how good the food actually is. For me, I'd still rather pay a little more and stick to my favourite Thai restaurants.",

    "text": "Ok, not the best Thai food in the world, but probably the best value-for-your-money Thai food in Singapore. There's usually a queue here for dinner, even late into a weekday evening around 9pm, so just prepare yourself. They serve authentic Thai food including all the classics and a killer sticky mango rice dessert. The prices are very affordable for a serviced restaurant with seating and free napkins, and they don't have GST or service charge! My only qualm is the pork floss on top of the pineapple fried rice, which seems like a very Singaporean-style of preparation. Still, save yourself from the food court, Black Canyon, or Thai Express and eat at Nakhon next time you have a craving! I believe there's three locations throughout Singapore.",

Nevertheless, I gave it a shot. Arrived 10 minutes earlier as I don't believe in queueing for food. Order was taken and the nice lady told me with a smile that once the store it's opened, we will be served promptly. Very nice.Ordered Tom Yam soup, $6 and my favorite Phad Thai $5. The restaurant was half full 2 minutes after opening. Food arrived pretty quickly. Dug into Phad Thai and the soup. My heart sank. Why is it so sweet? The Phad Thai appeared to have a big bunch of sugar in it. Like wise for the soup. I have made both dishes at home and it can taste good without the sugar load. I looked around me and I can see patrons tucking enthusiastically into the sugar bin. For the easy on the pocket prices, I can see why it's so popular.Came here a second time and was hoping it will be better. The green curry chicken is horrible. It's frozen chicken and paste at best.",

Also, it gave me enough time to extensively study the menu and decide what to get. A bonus is also that after a while they took our order whilst still being in line so once we got to our seats our food was served super fast.The atmosphere in the restaurant was great, it was obviously super busy but not in an annoying \"full cantine\" type of way, it was just bustling and when seated outside you could still enjoy the live music from Bar Bar Black Sheep across the street. I actually like that they use fans instead of aircon, this creates a cozier environment instead of a sterile place. The staff was very helpful which was unexpected since they were so busy.And then the food... Super delicious! We had the Shrimp Tom Yum soup, I am typically not a Tom Yum fan but this was super yummy (sorry for the bad pun).Since my dining companion preferred not to go for spicy dishes (except for the Tom Yum soup which had quite a kick), we went for the spring rolls, chicken in pandan leaves, green curry and pad thai. All of these dishes were fantastic, they tasted clean and had the right balance.I was in a pretty good mood when the check arrived as I noticed that there was no service or gst added. 27$ for two persons, what a bargain!Will I go again? You bet! Who doesn't love cheap, delicious food and good service?",

The line forms out the door at 5:30pm when it's opened for dinner as any other cheap and great for value dining in Sing, so come early to avoid queue.

The prawn were fresh, and the curry is rich with a nice aroma of coconut, basil, and the long beans and fig were crunchy. The stir fried asparagus is a surprise, a good balance of garlic brought out the sweetness of the asparagus, the carrots is probably there to add color, but the prawns here is probably frozen thawed type. Pandan leaf chicken is a biggest pleasant surprise of all, very tender like otah, chicken chunks soft. A definite repeat order.Tom yum is well prepared. Good balance of spicy and sour, and seafood prawn and squid is fresh, I don't normally order Tom yum on my own, but this dish is good enough for me to try.I would not order the pineapple rice next time round. No comments on the taste but I do think white rice will bring out the tastes of the above dishes better.",
