    "text": "Seriously this place has one of the best crispy and thick waffles I have ever eaten! When I placed my order, the waiter came to tell me it would take at least 15 minutes. I ordered a sour plum soda $3 + $1 for iced. It tasted good to me, my mother had expected it to be a bit sweeter.Rum and Raisin Waffles $9++When it was served to me, it looked so brown, I had wondered if it was burnt, but it didn't smell burnt. The ice cream tasted strong of alcohol, there were raisins in the ice cream and in almost every pocketed square of the waffle as well! The waffle was so crispy and because it was a very thick waffle, it was still fluffy on the inside. Even my mother compliment the waffle, and she rarely has great things to say about waffles, considering she made waffles for breakfast just yesterday.All in all, they serve a variety of food and I will be back to try more main course and definitely for more waffles!",

Bliss Restaurant may not serve the best food around, but it certainly has a nice chilling atmosphere for you to sit and enjoy a nice supper or late night drink with a good friend.I never knew the Community Centres can be so hip until I visited Bliss Restaurant at Cheng San CC. The food was so-so but the environment is pretty good. Besides the \"hu\" and the \"hah\" from the guys in the basketball court doing taekwando or other activities, it's actually pretty enjoyable. You can choose from the alfresco outdoor dinning (it can get rather dim so you may not really be able to see what you are eating) or the indoor dinning (for those who cannot live without aircon).They also have an interesting selection of alcohol from beer to wines and even cocktails. For some sweet bites, the selection of desserts is still decent but of course, not comparable to a town restaurant.The price is economical and overall experience. Wouldnt mind hanging out there again soon.",

A social restaurant.I had the lamp shank and felt that it was overlooked as the meat was too soft. The sauce wasn't adding enough flavours to the dish. Only the mash potato which supposed to be the secondary item tasted great. This is a restaurant where it creates jobs for the special people. Therefore please support them whenever you are nearby. Might try other foods next time. Giving them another chance.",

    "text": "Bliss used to be at Punggol Park and it served the residents in the area very well. Waterfront dining by the pond was awesome. That's till it got taken over by Wild Oats. :( Nevertheless, we managed to hunt it down at Cheng San Community Center. It's quite a chill place if you stay on till late, which we did, with our bottle of Moscato. The drinks list is pretty extensive, like it was at Punggol Park. The service is more attentive now that the space is smaller and brighter (the servers can finally see our faces). Beer, cocktails, wines etc are available along with Western mains and snacks and desserts.We had some finger food which were not too bad. In my alcoholic state, i could hardly remember what i ate but i vaguely remember the cheese fries which were quite good and chicken wings maybe? The mud pie wasn't too shady as well.In all, not a bad place to get decent food and wine at affordable prices.",

    "text": "A new found place to have a glass or two beer. It is located in a community center near to Ang Mo Kio MRT. The restaurant offers quite a variety of alcohol drinks besides the usual western menu. Something special in a neighbourhood.What we like about the place is that it offers alcohol at a reasonable price and not crowded. The pace there is slow and you can enjoy the night sitting there. Another good thing is that it is easily accessible, out of safety concern. we can take public transport back after in take of alcohol.Never had the chance to try any main dish there. But from observation, serving are quite big but serving time is quite slow. We ordered fries to go along with the beer. Beer took some time to be serve and fries took even longer. It was serve after we are half through our beer. But what's the hurry when you are at a slow pace place. Totally acceptable",

    "text": "We had our dinner here as I was recommended by my colleague of the wide varieties of food they serve. The food was ok. Not exceptionally different than any other restaurants like swensen's. One thing to note, servers were inexperience and you could be exasperated that they kept coming to clear your dish when clearly food are still on the plates. They have their rubbish cart places right behind our seating area. I guess that explain why we have the fruitflies kept attacking our food. Some flies even fall into our plates. We were busy shooing the flies away while eating.We were there for long as a family gathering. When we left, 2 mins after we realized we left our daughter's jacket at the restaurant's chair. My husband walked back to retrieve it. To his astonishment, when he enquire with the waiter, clearly a senior waiter (maybe the business owner), the waiter mentioned that he threw the jacket away. My daughter's jacket is a sweet pink clean jacket wore only today! He could thought that it's unwanted and threw into their rubbish cart! It's totally bad service and even not wanting to keep the jacket thinking someone might come back to get it. To come for food to fill stomach and go, probably could consider. For service and food, McDonald's probably is a better place to eat.",

    "text": "Located within Cheng San Community Center, Bliss restaurant is an alfresco-themed restaurant serving western food. Their menu presents quite a standard selection of western food - grilled chicken, steak, pastas, fish.I ordered their grilled chicken and sausage, priced at $18.90 before GST. The presentation of the dish was pretty well done. However, the taste was normal: nothing good nor bad about the dish. After main course, my friends and I ordered some of their desserts: Choke on Choc and a Banana split. When it came, the portion was humongous. One can literally choke on the amount of ice cream served. We left the restaurant barely able to finish the desserts.I would say that their desserts were pretty good, but the main course meals were a bit on the expensive end, considering the quality of food. Service was slow, even for a a relatively empty restaurant. I recommend Bliss restaurant for some after meal desserts.",

With both an air-conditioned interior and an open-air exterior complete with candles perfect for chilling out with a drink alone or with friends, Bliss can accomodate a huge crowd. The food offered is reasonably tasty, with standard western fare like pasta and meat dishes. Their finger food stands out as awesome tidbits to share with friends and family. However, the selection of alcohol Bliss Restaurant offers makes one almost spoilt for choice. Picking your poison and pairing it with the proper dishes elevates the flavours and amplifies the experience.",
