The wrap is also excellent - juicy meat with complementary hummus and veggies. Portions are huge - best if you go with a group and sample various things. A bit expensive but worth it.",

    "text": "I loved the menu at Blu Kouzina. We ordered a range of plates to share and were very impressed by the flavours. \u00a0Authentic Greek food without any compromises. \u00a0The house prepared tzatziki was refreshing, perfectly accompanied by crispy pita bread. \u00a0The calamari was lightly fried and juicy. \u00a0The fattoush salad and salmon were delicate in taste and of excellent quality. \u00a0Plenty of beverages on offer too. \u00a0Apart from ouzo, you will find some of your favourites. \u00a0I particularly enjoyed the oversized Margarita, given the warmth of the day.Inside, the restaurant is presented like an old taverna with relics from Greece. \u00a0Welcoming and comforting yet airy, \u00a0plenty of space to make your party feel at home.The Dempsey Hill area itself is a great place to explore, with various galleries and antique shops. \u00a0A pleasant way to spend an afternoon in Singapore.",

    "text": "Huge fan since their old days in Bukit Timah area (I think it was there before).Visited two days in a row in this Dempsey location and was blown away. I definitely didn't think I would get this kind of Mediterranean food in Singapore with excellent choices of Greek wine. The service is prompt and friendly with a perfect ambiance to feel like it's a sharing type restaurant. Very Mediterranean feel!I had their chicken skewers with hummus and french fries which was a great choice. The flavor of the chicken was amazing, very moist and delicious.The second day I tried both their chicken and beef shwarmas which I wouldn't quite recommend as much as the skewers.Highly recommend for a great Mediterranean meal in Singapore.",

Even though they do not have kids menu to go with but the place is kid's friendly. Food is perfect to meet your palate. We ordered their signature dips, salad with olives,onions, feta and cherry tomatoes, feta psiti, and a meat platter to share. Ingredients were fresh and flavors were uniquely blended to bring out the taste of each ingredient and the spices used to cook the dishes. And wine \u00a0paired perfectly \u00a0to go with our choices of food selection. This place is definitely a must visit.",

The tzatziki, hummus and pita were great to start. We shared a chicken pita, steak and the grilled octopus. Hands down the best octopus I've ever had, it will be very difficult to top. I hope to dine here again on my next visit this beautiful country!",

We preferred vegetarian options to their meats. Having said that, the lamb chops was divine. Waitstaff stellar. Prices a tad high. Will be back again and again.",

Almost brings me back to summers I'd spent in Greece! Only complaint is that the dining area in the back that was designed to be a glasshouse of sorts feels like one, too - when the sun's out it's a sauna in there.",

I asked for medium well lamb, it was well done. \u00a0My friend asked for well done meat, his was well done. \u00a0 Personally I've had much much much better Greek food, at much more reasonable prices. \u00a0They did bring out a dessert with a candle, which was delicious. \u00a0Nice enough service, but I think I can find better.",
