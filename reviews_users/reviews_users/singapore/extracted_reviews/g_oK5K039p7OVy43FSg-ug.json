    "text": "A craving for Japanese food led my friends and I to Ginza Bairin one fine afternoon. As I felt like having something soup, I went for the spicy tonkotsu ramen. It was really rather spicy which was quite a good twist from usual non-spicy ramen, but the soup base was disappointingly bland. There was a lot of noodles, although there could probably be more ingredients. The service was extremely fast and there wasn't much to complain about. I would go back again probably to try their katsudon which they're more famous for, definitely not for the ramen.",

    "text": "Ginza Bairin is located at B4 basement at Ion Orchard. I love the Ginza Bairin in Tokyo. The one here is very different in terms of the decor and ambience. The Ginza Bairin is cozy and warmth. I know I know, I kept overusing the word \"cozy\", but I really really like cozy places. Perhaps the Ginza Bairin Singapore has a bit of a almost fast food feel, or maybe it was just the lightings. Not sure why there were so many white/bright lightings in many places in Singapore; my face looked sickly greenish once in a grocery store. It was hideous!!The staffs here were always nice but the staffs at Ginza Bairin in Tokyo were nice and warmth. Ginza Bairin is famous for tonkatsu which is fried Japanese pork cutlet. The tonkatsu here was always crispy, tender and juicy during my visits there. Ginza Bairin is definitely for people who love tonkatsu!!",

    "text": "Recently the causal Japanese restaurant has re-opened after been closed for upgrading. The restaurant is known for its deep fried pork cutlet. There is 50% off the items in the menu for the first 3 days. However the well-known sandwiches and side dishes are not available during the promotion period. Although there is a lot of people queuing up for the promotion, one can find a seat easily as food is served quite fast and the turnover is fast too.After making payment at the cashier, one would be given a number tag where food will be served to you at your table.Tonteki (pork steak) ($22)Served with Gonzalez bairin's special sauce, pickles and deep fried garlic slices. Plus a bowl of miso soup. The dish is one of the new dishes in the new menu. The meat is juicy and goes well with the wasabi like sauce. However the garlic slices are not crispy and texture too chewy.Ton Kara ($2.50)Available in 3 types : pork, chicken and chicken wing. Battered with Bairin's way of battering, then cooked with CONFIT cooking method which involves cooking the meat in its own fat.The pork version is too fatty with the thick layers of fat, while the chicken version is too salty. The chicken wing fares slightly better.Overall the food is average with improvements needed. Service is not bad with staffs clearing the tables swiftly.",

It was $16.00 inclusive of 7% GST, I didn't think it was worth that price for something I could get fast food version in Japan or event at a food court here in Singapore. The tonkatsu costs around $21-25; not worth the price either. The price probably is to cover up rent in ION orchard; but definitely not the quality of the food. Karaage usually comes in small pieces but ginza bairin chose to have them large - too big in my opinion. Had a hard time biting off the chicken to fit my mouth; even tore the roof of my mouth in the process...",

The price of my meal with an iced green tea came up to SGD 22 (which is reasonable for a good Tonkatsu in Singapore). Plus don't forget that the set comes with unlimited rice, cabbage and soup. All you have to do is ask a waiter what you would like and he will bring it to your table. That's pretty awesome because I love eating lots of cabbage with sesame dressing together with the Tonkatsu!! :-)Restaurant: It's really just a place where you eat and leave. It's more a \"canteen\" style restaurant so don't expect a nice, quiet and cozy venue ;)Service: The service is just okay... It's really the minimum but it's fine for this kind of establishment. Basically, all the waiters do is serve your meal and clean your table when you leave. Don't forget that you must order before sitting!! I saw a few people waiting to order until they noticed people sat holding a number... The waiters don't bother telling you how it works unless you ask (which is what I did).Food: The Tonkatsu was nice with a crispy crust and cooked well keeping the juiciness of the pork. I will definitely go back for it.",

The pork is (usually) crispy, flavourful, and the portions are pretty decent. It's a wee bit pricy, but I'm usually quite full wen I'm done so I'm not really complaining.The curry's good, not amazing, but I particularly always like the tonkatsu-don with egg. It's a sloppy mess, but damn is it a delicious sloppy mess.It's not the fanciest of places, nor the cheapest of places, but it's a simple no-frills option that I often turn to when I'm stumped on where to eat. And thankfully, it hasn't let me down yet.",

Slowly but surely the crowds turned up after 8pm.Knowing that pork cutlets were their speciality, I went for the Special Katsudon ($15 after 10% JPassport discount). It came with a runny egg that I gleefully burst and mixed into the rice. Verdict, it was as good and savory as the ones I had in Japan.

Turns out after we ordered we were given a number tag and had to find our own seats. Not much of a problem though - there were visibly empty seats.The food took some time to come but it was impressive. The crispy batter that is. It was extravagantly crunchy and wrapped the meat well without being oily. The cheese croquette... Sigh, was a disappointment. The crisps was thick and the potato too, which left little room for the cheese inside. It was a sad patronising smear of cheese. For $3+ per croquette, I'd definitely not buy it again.",

Used to be being disappointed at the poor imitations that local stalls offer, I almost gave up hope of ever finding some decent here in Singapore.Luckily, there's Ginza Bairin. Introduced by my girlfriend, I have to say I was sold the first time I tried it. They have a choice of normal or Kurobuta (black pig) to choose from and I went with the normal option. A set meal costs about $18, pretty pricey for something relatively simple, but after my first encounter, I guess you could say the price is worth it. In addition to the tonkatsu, there is a variety of other dishes on offer as well, but if you ask me, I'd say go for the normal tonkatsu. They definitely won't disappoint.",

While I'm not particularly a big fan of tonkatsu, I have to say that Ginza Bairin does satisfy my cravings with the more than decent offering. The tonkatsu is not too oily and deep fried while retaining the succulent and juicy meat and you always get a good crunch. The variety on offer is really comprehensive so it is always good to take a look at the menu before ordering or you'll definitely hold up the queue.",

    "text": "OK I confess, I've been here 4 times, and every time, I order the SAME thing. I'm not sure what it is about this place that keeps me coming back. Perhaps it's the fact that there never seems to be a queue, it's open quite late (I go at around 9pm on weekdays) and the food is quite delicious. \u00a0The only issue I have with it is that it's somewhat on the pricey side so I always have to debate if I want to spend close to $20 on a fast-food type meal. I spend around $17 per meal when I get the Croquette Curry Cheese set and an iced green tea. The Croquette Curry Cheese set... mmmm... yummy, though I suspect not very Japanese fare of fried potato / cheese and curry with rice and soup. Being the carb lover that I am, what's not to love??My friend is in love with their Ebi Fry set - she has also ordered this many, many times and it costs around $18. According to her, it's delicious, so that may be worth trying out also. I'll definitely head back here to sample their other dishes.",

No frills and tasty Katsu was what drew me to their chain in Tokyo and this new outlet in Singapore did not disappoint. Great place to have Fried breaded Japanese style pork",

    "text": "Ginza Barin was my frequent choice for dinner after work because the portions are big and the food is pretty decent. The tonkatsu has always been pretty much up to standard - the deep fried breaded pork fillets are not too oily and the meat is usually still tender enough. Recently, I took to the Ebi Fry set -3 huge battered (but succulent) prawns served up with steaming rice accompanied by delicious tartar sauce. But, I won't be going back anytime soon because I had a horrible experience \u00a0the last time around. Got berated by a service staff when I requested for a second serving of tartar sauce - apparently it is only ethical to put up this request after you have licked up every last bit of the sauce that is on your plate. Wow. I was flabbergasted considering I had about two dips worth of sauce left. Left a horrible aftertaste so don't patronise this place if you are one who enjoys your food and would like a little more sauce from time to time.",
