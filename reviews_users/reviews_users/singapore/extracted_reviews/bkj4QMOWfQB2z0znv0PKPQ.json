We came in for the famous pork soup and paired it with a bowl of rice and vegetables. The flavor notes of the soup is incredibly rich and intense. We were both shell-shocked. We also arrived right before closing, which the restaurant happily accommodated. They even gave us additional servings of soup for free (not sure if this is a free gesture anyway). Whether you are looking for a place to eat a full meal or a snack, this is a MUST TRY.",

    "text": "After reading my previous review (Jumbo Seafood), you might ask: \"So what is the second \"must-try\" food when in Singapore?\"The answer is: bak kut teh from Song Fa (7 locations in Singapore). \u00a0The literal translation of \"bak kut teh\" is \"meat bone tea\". \u00a0It is more generally (and accurately) translated as \"pork rib soup\".The story was that back in 1969 the founder of the chain sold this delicious soup made with pork ribs and a secret blend of spices in a push-cart stall. \u00a0At the time he couldn't even afford a refrigerator and he had to store his ribs in the freezer from a friend's liquor store.Today Song Fa is a household name in Singapore and the lines of each of its seven stores are always out the door into the streets and sometimes wrapped around the block.But they were also very efficient - a server took our order while we were still standing in line and gave us a ticket from his iPad. \u00a0Once we were seated our order arrived at our table very promptly.The peppery broth was made with pork ribs, a blend of secret spices and lots of white pepper. \u00a0The white pepper gave a distinct and strong flavor to the broth that was stimulating to the palate. The rib meat, which has soaked in the richness of the broth, fell off the bone effortlessly and was melt-in-your-mouth tender.After you finish your ribs when there is more room in the bowl, you can ask for a refill of the soup. \u00a0They will happily do that. \u00a0In fact I saw some people ask for two or more refills.While they probably won't tell you their secret recipe, they do sell boxes of pre-mixed packets of the spices at the cashier's counter. \u00a0Yours truly actually bought a box of 10 packets, each of which is good for 4 - 6 servings. \u00a0I am actually making the soup right now. \u00a0I'll let you know how it goes when I see you next time.",

You can ask for refills on the broth at all their locations. \u00a0The meat is extremely tender and they often run out of the \"tender pork bone\" soup, which is really just baby back pork ribs instead of regular pork ribs. \u00a0Traditionally, people get the pickled mustard greens to eat with it as well as maybe some rice. \u00a0The chinese donut (yeow taow) goes well as a \"crouton\" in the soup.The BKT here is excellent and this is the BKT you must try in SG!",

    "text": "Stumbled across this place googling good places to eat near Chinatown Point in Singapore. This place looked like it had great reviews so I though I'd give this a try. To be honest I don't even like most soups, or pork ribs, but I wanted to try something new and was hoping this place would change my mind... and oh it did. I had dinner early so I missed the dinner rush lineup, and was seated right away. They gave me a stool for my belongings and a cloth to cover them. I ordered the small bowl of pork ribs soup with rice and water. The dish arrived literally immediately after I ordered. The meat was fall-of-the-bones tender, and the soup was a delightful mix of spices and it was so delicious it was nothing I could put words to. The soup was refillable too, and the waiters were constantly coming by to refill the soup. I seriously want to know what went into that soup but will likely never find out. I wish I could be back, but I'm halfway across the globe now and still craving this. So, if you happen to be in Singapore, give this a try.",

Get there earlier (before 9pm) or the premium pork loin may be sold out. So tender and fall-off-the-bone! There's two shops in this location -- one at the corner and another a couple shops down, so don't be confused! Make sure you arrange to meet at the same place. There's no big difference between the two except one has air conditioning and one doesn't. Can't go wrong with either.",
