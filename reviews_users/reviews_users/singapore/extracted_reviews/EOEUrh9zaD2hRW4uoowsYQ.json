    "text": "4 stars only because the army stew here has beef broth in it. I love beef but for most of my friends who can't eat beef for religious purpose, it's a bummer. It's been a while since I've been here but since I was in the vicinity and craving army stew for a long while, we decided to head over there.Verdict:- Army stew (contains beef broth and pork) - This is delicious except that I found the soup abit lacking in taste, to which I added some soyabean chili paste. Yum! The stag will thoughtfully put a pot of soup on your table in case you need to top up the soup, which gets thicker and spicier as it boils.  - Woo Samgyup - This is their trademark beef with marinated sauce. Guess the trademark comes from the secret sauce recipe. The beef is tender and juicy yet thin. It's like shabu beef on grill! - Pork belly grill - This is awesome as always; well marinated. But I found the fats pretty daunting so I stuck mostly to the beef! Total bill came up to $100 exact! How often is it you get a whole, round number? :) All in all, I was amazed that the staff grilled the meat for you which could be a Singapore thing. However, if you go to other korean restaurants at Tanjong Pagar, some of them let you grill the meat yourself. That's the fun part I feel!Tip: Go there early for dinner as the dinner crowd starts streaming in from 630pm. I was there at 530pm and got a nice seat quickly.",

    "text": "I stopped here on Tuesday for lunch with my family. It was pretty quiet inside (at about noon I believe) so we were seated immediately. We ordered the Woo Samgyup, marinated beef and bibimbop. My favorite dish was the Woo Samgyup. The meat was amazing and when I wrapped it in lettuce with a bit of shaved green onions and sauce it was even better. This was my first time having Woo Samgyup, and I have to say that I will definitely have it again. The only thing is that aside from cooking for you at your table, the servers don't really stop by to check up on you.",

The Kimchi Jigae has deteriorated as well. The rice is dry. The service staff look like they don't want to work there. Consider retraining and incentivizing your service staff better. Don't take short cuts, don't lower quality.",

    "text": "I went into this restaurant not knowing what to expect and merely base it on the reviews I read on Yelp. When I saw the long queue outside and the abundance of tables inside when I enter, I was surprised and thought it must be an awesome marketing strategy! To make you feel like it's very popular!But I can't blame them, during our meals, the servers have been very dedicated to help us grill our meats that they are probably quite shorthanded.Service-wise, their servers literally stood beside my table and cooked the meat well for us, leaving us to fully enjoy our meal. Tea however was often not refilled, and I don't like that they use plastic containers for the tea. As for the food, the kimchi soup is nice and authentic, but a little too spicy for me. For each time we visit, always loved them serving the long row of vegetables that are so fresh, crunchy and so... green!Each time, I ordered only two sets of meat for two persons to share and couldn't finish it. Tried their five spices marinated meat, pork belly, the first page highly recommended beef and the premium beef set. Ranges from $22-$48.Overall, this is a nice Korean restaurant that I would love to visit again, though its a little pricey.",

    "text": "Sunday lunch with mommy and I was craving for a korean food so here we are. Trying bornga for the first time. The food is very delicious and a bit pricey when I first saw it, but it turned out it was worth it. They served a long tray of veggies, limited variation of banchan (side dishes) and very very refreshing seaweed soup. YUM! The galbi and the pork belly were very satisfying. The waitress cooked the meat, so we dont have a chance to slow down our eating speed, and i wasnt allowed to put garlic on top of the grill. Sad! I love eating meat with grilled garlic. We also ordered their kimchi soup but it was just so so. I would come here again when I crave for some korean food.",

The food is arguably good enough to justify it though.",

The beef were fresh and quality too. It is good that someone helped us grill the meat. Most of the time we overcooked the meat when we DIY. Those side dishes were simply delicious and quality. They serve a long tray of veggies which is very fresh. Table setting were alright, not too cramp. Quite a nice ambience for dine & chat with family or business associates. Would recommend for those who don't mind paying a little more for quality food.",

Their vegetables are fresh and yummy and I am surprised to see that most of the other patrons hardly touched it. The less than perfect thing about Bornga is that their banchan side dishes are limited. We were only served 3 standard types of side dishes (everyone had the same 3) and although they tasted good, I was slightly disappointed at the lack of selection. But having said that, the delicious meats and reasonable prices will bring me back! I am getting hungry just thinking about it.....",
