Pros: cocktails were nice and strongCons: well those cocktails are very expensive. Yes it's MBS but a look at the spirits section will illustrate how overpriced everything is. Next, the ambience. If they had turned the music down by A LOT, it would've been a pleasant experience. The music was already very very loud when we entered, but as the night went on, it got progressively louder. Imagine, 4 people sitting around a table but you can't even hold a conversation, even if you're shouting. The music was deafening... probably louder than a club! I'm not sure who will go there for drinks with friends at night... I know I won't be....",

Oddly enough, the vegetable appetizer - zucchini flower with charred eggplant - was probably the standout.Overall, I think the menu suffers from a case of style over substance. There's too much focus on zesty Asian flavours as opposed to ensuring the quality of ingredients. I kind of get what the chef is aiming for, but the meal was not too cohesive. Food aside, service was excellent and the meal was redeemed by a decent wine list.",

    "text": "ADRIFT is located in the Tower 2 Lobby of the MBS Hotel. \u00a0 I've been twice in the last month: once for lunch in the dining room and again for drinks & snacks in the lounge. \u00a0Both visits, I encountered a very friendly & helpful staff and enjoyed both their signature and classic cocktails. \u00a0The menu is a mixed bag of modern Asian inspired shared tapas dishes. On both visits everyone had unfavorable impressions of the food. \u00a0 In reply to ADRIFT's pretentious slogan - \"Indulge Your Palate's Wanderlust\" (Kudos for combining three cliched \"50-cent\" words into one nausea inducing catch phrase) \u00a0No matter the marketing tag line, the drinks are good, but there is not much of an epicurean adventure here.As the first course of our set lunch, we were presented with a plate of slightly stale spiced caramel popcorn and rice crackers. \u00a0It's the sort of thing you might expect your 10 year old child to serve you after volunteering to make dinner and using only what was already on hand. \u00a0Not a good way to start a journey.The Buckwheat Chicken Nuggets served with a honey mustard sauce ($18) was another dish directly from the mind of a 10 year old. \u00a0Entirely forgettable except for the battered and fried Cock's Comb that was presented on the plate as garnish. (Yes! That's the floppy thing from the top of the chicken's head) \u00a0 Like the restaurant's catch phrase - this too wreaked of dou\u00a2#\u20ac baggery.The Fried Okra with Pork Belly and tamarind sauce ($14) was again the kind of unexpected dish that seemed concocted from random mismatched ingredients already on hand. \u00a0The okra was oily, not battered or crispy enough , and the combined flavors of okra, pork and tamarind were mediocre. \u00a0The King Crab Pimento Cheese Melt \u00a0($35) is one of their signature tapas. \u00a0For the price and the buildup, we had high hopes. \u00a0But the sandwich (cut into 3 pieces for sharing) had only one note of flavor. The crab was overpowered by the pimento cheese. They could easily 86 the crab and serve a cheese only version for half the price. \u00a0The Shishito Peppers with Sea Salt ($13) were mildly flavored and this little wallflower of a dish could quietly disappear from the menu without being missed.The Crispy Baby Potatoes with Seaweed and Parmesan ($13) were enjoyed on both visits. \u00a0Baby potatoes with a crispy outside - this was the clear favorite of the small dishes we ordered. \u00a0With the fixed price lunch, we were served two dry and very forgettable sandwiches. \u00a0Afterwards, we shared two ala carte \"mains\" that get better reviews than what I've listed above. Simple and straightforward, the Iberico Pork and Wagyu Beef with caramelized onions were the highlight of the meal. (see photos) This was followed by 2 forgettable desserts both served with ice cream. During both visits we noted the silly notepad-like menus. Written in difficult to read all CAP text, there's very little on each page - resulting in a lot of flipping back and forth. The dim lighting in the lounge made the text on the shimmery paper difficult to read. \u00a0With several different menus in circulation, the staff got the lunch, dinner and bar menus mixed up. The Good: The comfortable stylishly retro decor, a friendly, attentive staff, good drinks. For those keeping score, the Iberico Pork, the Wagyu Beef and the Crispy Baby Potatoes got thumbs up from everyone. From the bar, the Penicillin and the Gin and Tonic were also delicious.The Bad: Just the act of flipping back and forth through the notepad style menu cheapened the experience. \u00a0 Most of the tapas dishes we ordered seemed uninspired and poorly conceived - resulting in mediocre and mostly forgettable flavor combinations. \u00a0Presentation of the plated dishes was not spectacular either. \u00a0Over 2 visits, I was with 6 friends and we ALL agreed: The food menu is ADRIFT's Achilles heel, and we'd be hesitant to recommend it solely because of the food.The Verdict: I really wanted to like ADRIFT, but its menu concept is literally adrift (amiss, astray). A good tapas restaurant has a menu full of gems. \u00a0We uncovered too many inferior to mediocre dishes to warrant another visit. \u00a0I'm not familiar with the chef. \u00a0Maybe the concepts for his other restaurants inspire more appealing recipes that have queues wrapping the block. \u00a0Maybe his name and reputation or the 3 towers full of tourists will keep this place afloat. \u00a0 I highly doubt locals will be returning en masse to \"indulge\" in the items we tried. \u00a0 \u00a0 2.5 Stars for the Food",

Generally food tends to try too hard to be adventurous and mix in strange tastes into all their food, but it doesn't seem to work too well. Maybe my expectations are too high, but then again they should be when you're paying almost 80 a person. Iberico pork chop was good, flavourful and tender, but nothing really special. Lamb chops likewise were alright, but nothing much to rave about. The lemongrass fish was just weird, but that might just be my bias against lemongrass. Lobster roll was hilariously tiny, and the wasabi in it didn't do it any favours. Crab pasta was average as well.Tl:Dr, \u00a0just go eat at db bistro instead, it's way better.",

Best french toast I've ever had in the world - the inside is pillow-soft and the outside is crunchy with sweet coconut sorbet mixed with the slightly bitter coffee syrup. Yummy!",
