I come for the dirt cheap prices of prata and the $5.00 chicken prata meal. They also have good murtabak. Their lime drink is too sweet! Nothing worth the trek over but if you're a student at NUS and need a break from the canteen, this is a good option.",

    "text": "One thing I like about this place is their self-serve payment station. You get your receipt from the staff, take it to the machine, scan and pay. Fuss-free and easy. That, and that it's near CCAB, you can simply walk over after your sports match for a meal. But... Everything else would turn me away from this place. - Pretty dishonest business. Prices stated on the menu and what you're actually charged is different. The staff just shrugged it off, stating the prices we were charged are right. (We noticed this for our drinks)- Service is horrible... The staff were mostly curt and unfriendly. Didn't bother to double check our orders and just walked away when we weren't even done. My bf was asking between two items, and the staff just scribbled something and walked off. \u00a0We had to go up to one of them to clarify the order before he keyed them in, fortunately we did because he ordered both items when we didn't even ask for both!- So disappointed with the food too. Curry was lacking in flavour and the prata itself was too chewy. Maggi goreng was ok at best. Definitely will not recommend, there are better places out there.",

    "text": "Very poor service and quality of food. The waiters don't know their menu and when asked for hummus, the Chinese waitress handed us coconut chutney (that's provided for dosas) and adamantly claimed that to be hummus. She also persistently insisted on changing our orders to dosas and idllis just because we are Indians. In terms of the food quality, they served us an over cooked chicken breast which was poorly seasoned and hard as a rock. When asked to change, the cashier informed us that we'll have to purchase subsequent orders and it won't be change for free. By the way, it was not just the chicken that was bland the fajitas ordered by my brother was tasteless. Next, regarding the cleanliness of the place, the menu books had dried rice sticking on them and curries poured on the pages. The washing and rest room area was beyond nasty. Smelled like urine, trash bin overflowed with napkins and clogged sinks with saliva floating around. We would NEVER patronize at this messed up place ever again.",

    "text": "I hate to agree with Cherrylene, but let's face it, she's right most of the time.I hate giving out negative reviews, but I think you should be aware that there are other options nearby with better food. \u00a0 I think I've done my due diligence coming here regularly over the last year to make sure my impressions of the food were correct. \u00a0The food indeed is mediocre at best and in some instances, not really worth the calories. \u00a0But then again, if you're hung over or just need to stuff your face after a night of drunken debauchery, the last thing you're counting is calories...in which case, this place will be just as good as any for a pit stop before falling unconscious into bed.I believe that the low watermark for an establishment with aspirations of Indian-Muslim culinary credibility should be the mutton murtabak. \u00a0 \u00a0Mr Prata's is doughy and the mutton is unrecognizably mealy. \u00a0It could be chicken...you just can't tell. \u00a0 This usually goes well with a fish curry; theirs is watery and recognizable only as fish curry if you really pay attention. \u00a0There is no hint of tamarind or fish and the consistency is that of day-old dishwater. \u00a0Let me remind you that these observations are not based on a single encounter, but a dozen visits over the last year.Yes, the ambience is nice enough. \u00a0Al fresco seating is pleasant and clean and you don't have to sit near a drain or a dumpster. \u00a0 And yes, it is open 24hrs daily. \u00a0Other than that, there isn't much else to recommend Mr Prata over Adam Road Food Centre, Newton down the street or Upper Bukit Timah 15 mins away.",

Both were excellent - the eggs in the egg/cheese were very fluffy and made the paratha rich and delicious. The regular paratha was tasty and excellent. The fish curry they come with is delicious. We also ordered chicken curry gravy on the side and it had even better spices and taste. Altogether very good paratha and I like that it's open 24/7.",

With Adam Road Food Centre pretty near by, I would recommend heading over there if you were really craving some good Indian-Muslim food. However, if you are just looking for a place to chill with friends while sipping teh-o bing then this is not a half-bad location. It's quiet later in the evening and has a comfortable al fresco setting. If you drive, you can park your car right in front of the place. I've never seen a parking attendant there.Be warned though, your teh-o ping might be watered down and sugary.",

Instead of a stuffy, dirty and crowded place, they have a nice outdoor seating full of trees. It's a pleasant experience dining here. And their food is really good too! I love their because its crispy, fluffy and not oily at all--something that's hard to find here. They have every kind of prata imaginable--even Italian prata! They also serve maggi and nasi goring, curries and dosa. In the daytime they have North Indian food too. Only thing about this place is that its hard to get here without a car since its in a side road and cabs don't pass by too often and there is no bustop on the road. Worth the trek though.",

It has an extensive menu of prata - whatever fillings you can dream of - and also typical mamak food and drinks like fried rice, fried noodle, milo, teh tarik, bandong. Don't expect healthy food and clean, quiet environment here although the place is in the middle of neighborhood which makes finding public transport a bit hard - bus or taxi are your best bet. This place is just a feel good place where you can talk as loud as you can while eating a good, greasy, cheap prata like it's supposed to be made.",
