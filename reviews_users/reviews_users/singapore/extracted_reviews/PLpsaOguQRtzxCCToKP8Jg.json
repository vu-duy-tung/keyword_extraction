I come here usually to get my indian costume and accessories and I'd usually bring friends and family to get theirs too. If you're looking for an affordable sari, punjabi suit or lengha and the accompanying accessories, then the 2nd floor is the only place you need to go! There's also a good range of men's indian costumes here from the casual to the elaborate.I got my sari blouse tailor-made here at one of the tailors for only $28. I also got a punjabi suit for $40 and got it tailored to fit me better just next door to the shop for only $8!The coffee shop downstairs has a good selection of indian food next to the wet market and a row of chinese food on the other side.Final verdict: Great buys for Indian costumes and great stop for your grocery and meal too!",

There were many stalls selling various types of biryani and south Indian dishes. I would recommend getting the fish biryani--they serve it on a banana leaf with different curries and it is truly out of this world!! There were several stalls selling this dish, but just go line up or \"queue up,\" as the Singaporeans say, in the longest queue and you won't be disappointed. Also, try the local drinks, which are very refreshing with your hot meal. This market is also attached to a large wet market so you can walk around when you're doing eating.",

Ginger hot tea in a small glass mug is amazing, which is tea mixed with ginger, honey, and milk. \u00a0Really good meals for less than 3 dollars. \u00a0There is a muslim influence on the food as well, so happy to try the different foods. \u00a0People just sit at your table in front of you when crowded, so be sure to take pictures of the strange looking man staring you down as you sip on your tea, like I did. \u00a0The only bad part is that the restrooms are disgusting, if you can find one, and you have money to pay for the exclusive ride. \u00a0Each stall also has a rating for cleanliness. \u00a0I only stuck to A ratings and there are very few of these, so keep that in mind. \u00a0Tekka Center is right next to the MRT, so it is easy to get there.",

Sanitation levels in Singapore are superb. )But it is absolutely dark grungy concrete - and the bathrooms and the meat stands selling sheep organs are right next to you.The open courtyard has fans and is somewhat cool.The interior aisles are jam packed with people.This is where a lot of the tables are.The lack of ventilation and the nine million stoves cooking nearby means that the temperature on the inner aisles is about fifteen degrees warmer than over in the courtyard.Never mind that. The food is great.It is divided into two sections - halal and not-halal.I generally eat on the halal side.And if the stand I want to eat in is on an aisle - then that is where I eat.Mostly the food is Tamil or Malaysian. I have eaten at several stands there and the Tamil food is some of the best I have had in Singapore.Check out Tekka Market and draw two experience cards for doing so.",

    "text": "Tekka Centre is a Hawker Center near the Little India MRT station. This center has a lot of food stalls to choose from. The levels of cleanliness from A to D were clearly visible for each stall. Definitely go for Level A and B stalls to prevent from getting sick from poor hygiene stalls. My family and I went here twice and this is a breakdown of their food: The mango lassi was not as creamy or as aromatic as I remembered it to be on my first visit here. But, it was vindicated on my second visit. Man oh man. Sweet, fragrant mango. It was so good. The mutton masala was spicy and flavorful and went well with garlic naan.Chicken tikka masala was ok. It didn't really have as much flavor as the mutton. The chicken tandoori was juicy and had a nice bbq taste. But, still not as good as Naseeb in Houston. The fish biryani here was good. The fish was moist and flaky. Lots of curry seasoning. The rice was fluffy deliciousness as well. Indonesian food was great here too. The Ayam Penyet was probably one of the best things I've eaten here. The chicken was fried perfectly and covered in a thick coat of chili sauce. It was so good. I would come again for just this (and mango lassi of course). Overall, I liked my experience here. If you want to get your Indian food fix, with a side of Indonesian, Malay, and Chinese food, look no further than Tekka Centre. Look at the attached pictures for my recommendations on which stalls to get what type of food.",

Better than usual becuase:1. The biryani rice is all yellow, no uneven rice spread like other seller. All evenly cooked. 2. Chicken curry drumsticks is so tender like it has been steam. Usually eating chicken with plastic spoons and fork would render it broken but their curry chicken drumstick is so tender that it just melt in your mouth. Must try if you like biryani and value for $$$$* One thing to note : The hawker centre is rather dirty especially during peak hour and at night when crowded , so just eat and go.",

There are two main levels, one of them housing a huge food court, and the upper leven housing a large market that sells quite a lot of fabric. The two times that I have been to Singapore I have wandered around here, especially to look at the fabrics on display, but also to grab something to eat. The thing that I found really disappointing is that the food court is basically an enlarged version of your typical hawker centre, and like many of them simply has a random selection of stalls, which means that they aren't exclusively Indian. That really annoyed me because the main reason I came to Little India was to have Indian food, and in particular curry - a dish that I had a lot of trouble finding.",

    "text": "Home to Singapore's largest indoor wet market, expect to see anything from black chickens to butchers violently chopping up slabs of goat meat to lush roma tomatoes. Fresh produce and variety both guaranteed.You'll also find a big coffeeshop on the ground floor and many other shops on the second floor residing in Tekka Market. Lots of good Indian food stalls to try out, but there are also Chinese and Malay stalls if for some reason, you don't feel like eating briyani. Shops on the second floor are just as colourful. Most sell ethnic Indian clothes that range from simple to elaborate, but there are also tailors, hardware shops and even an antique store! Once I was there with family, mum was admiring a sleeveless salwaar kameez on display outside an apparel shop. Sensing her interest and noticing that she wears the tudung, the staff suggested using the dupatta as sleeves. There was a tailor just next door, and she told us that her neighbour could sew them up within half an hour. Excellent idea! Mum was very pleased with her new outfit.",

    "text": "My new regular hangout: briyani + teh halia has become my regular lunchtime formula as of late!Initially ventured here in search of Teh Halia and this place has since become home to 2 of the best cups of Teh Halia I've ever tasted!Maya Mohan - 2 stalls in Tekka Market, both equally good. The tea was fragrant and flavourful, and they certainly weren't stingy when it came to the ginger essence. In contrast, EVERYTHING else tastes weak and diluted. A must-have at Tekka Market. Get the hot version- the ice just melts way too fast in the cold one, leaving the tea tasting too diluted.AR Rahman - just as nice, though the ginger essence isn't as strong, but otherwise ALMOST as good as Maya Mohan.",

    "text": "My mum drags me to Tekka Market every Christmas eve, and there we get everything she needs for all the cooking that happens over the next 48 hours.So take note, this review is regarding the wet market part of Tekka Market, not the hawker side. There're some of the best vegetable/produce sellers I've seen in Singapore. Fresh herbs, vegetables, fruits, everything and anything. There're butchers, (we always end up buying mutton, meat, bones, and marrow), seafood sellers, poultry sellers...I mean, this here is a good and proper wet market, so expect strong smells, wet floors, and things to be a little sticky. But considering I end up going back every year? Trust me when I say it's still pretty worth it.",

Naan, roti, dosas, briyani. U really can't go wrong. \u00a0Some of the best mutton briyani I've ever had and I eat Indian at least 2x a month back in the states. So much to choose from and only one stomach. I'll be back again very soon Tekka...yes I will.",
