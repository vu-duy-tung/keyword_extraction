    "text": "Went there on recommendation of several Indian friends, all gourmets, saying something along the lines of \"it's just like home\". Yet the room was mostly ang mohs with only a couple Indian families... Everything is freshly cooked to order, the cook is experienced and balances flavours well and the menu is surprisingly broad crossing several Indian states, allowing you to sample many pages from the immense dictionary of Indian cuisine. I even discovered a new sauce, the mustard one, which is fascinatingly addictive and surprisingly flavourful considering how thin it was.It is the first time in a couple of years that the food reaches the level that I had found with my 8th dabbawallah when I worked for a few months in Mumbai (the first 7 were unsatisfactory, this one cost twice as much and was worth every rupee). The downside of quality and no corner cutting is that you have to pay for it. Especially if you are going for the veg dishes: $15-20 for an eggplant sliced in two, or a small bowl of mashed greens, may seem a bit excessive. I didn't mind; to quote Philippe Noiret \"luxury cannot be an industry; it can only be an object made by an artisan, that is unique, ordered by a person to another person\" (\"Pour moi, le luxe ne saurait \u00eatre une industrie. Ce ne peut \u00eatre qu'un objet fabriqu\u00e9 par un artisan, c'est-\u00e0-dire unique, command\u00e9 par une personne \u00e0 une autre personne\"). Indian cuisine is so delicate, complex and difficult to execute well that I was happy to pay for the personal version.",

    "text": "My brother and I came to Mustard as it came up in searched as one of the top Indian restaurants in Little India/Singapore. We were lucky enough to come in and grab a table on an early evening-- the restaurant seemed to fill up immediately after!We ordered:+ Paneer Pakore: Crispy, but lacking flavor. There was no mint chutney layered inside as I expected. On the side, they surprisingly only served tamarind sauce; had to request the mint chutney as an add on. + Butter Chicken: Really great flavor, but could have used more pieces of chicken!+ Saag Paneer: Also really great flavor, and plenty of paneer, but couldn't get over the fact this was essentially a very thin puree. I felt like I could've drank this entree. + Garlic Naan: So delicious, probably the best garlic naan I've ever had. I struggled to not give this more than 3 stars, but in all reality, as good as their food is, given the price points and the improvements that could be made, I'll wait to try again before bumping them up. Lots of potential to be great!",

    "text": "We stopped in after walking around little India because we wanted to try Indian good in Singapore. \u00a0It was great! We tried the Aloo Jhuri Bhaja at Cholar Dal, the Saag Gosht and the Malai Koftka. My personal favorite was the Malai Koftka-- the potatoes seemed like they were deep fried and mixed in a creamy cashew sauce with cheese. Delicious! Similar to shahi paneer. The saag was good-- the lamb was not over cooked and very succulent. Could have handled a little more spice to be honest. :) the Aloo Jhuri Bhaja was good. It was thinner and had lentils. Plainer in taste than I envisioned- probably healthier as well. It was served with fried potatoes (thin French fries) on top.",

By 7:30 or so the shop got full. Wow, so popular it is, I thought. Prawn Coconut Curry is must, which had many prawns. Mutton Biriyani is hot but tasty. and we took 2 Nuns, something egg plant and 2 beer jugs. We enjoyed all of them and the bill was S$130 around. It is one of nice Indian restaurants I had in Singapore.",

    "text": "Now I've got to say - Mustard is a lovely wee restaurant. The plus side - you wil find reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor - and everyone in there that night looked to be a tourist for us. The downside - it is far more expensive than a lot of the cafes in Little India... but I would suggest you could find similar quality for cheaper - just look at all of the cafes heaving with people. But, if you are happy to spend the money, Mustard will not fail you. And, we got to try quite a few new things which we hadn't encountered before, which is also a plus. What we checked out - Kolkata Shingara - a cauliflower, potato and peanut type samosa, which had less flavour than I expected it to have, with occasional burst of peanut waking up from a fairly timid flavour; and the Kalbadi Chop, a potato patty stuffed with a layer of pea, a surprisingly tasty starter. I definitely had my money on the wrong pony when we made our order. For my main, I went for the Malai Kofta, which was a pleasingly stodgy ball of potato in cheese in a cashew gravy. I can't tell a lie - the gravy was the winning element in this order, and it tasted great when it arrived. The boy had a meat dish. although I can't remember what it was, so we'll leap over that one gracefully and head straight for the summary. Our two courses (with naan, rice and a jug of beer) came to 60 bucks, which we didn't think was a terrible price to pay for a pretty delicious meal. Mustard isn't upmarket, nor is it a spit and sawdust type place, but fits neatly into the middle of the road. As I said at the beginning of this review, you wouldn't be upset to find yourself here, and neither were we, but I'm not necessarily sure it really stands that far out of the crowd.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why this place was so busy on the Monday night we visited. The decor was as you'd expect for a nice Indian restaurant, but the food very ordinary, using cheap cuts of meat. Service was ok, but the waiter didn't inform us of the extra charges for boneless chicken (which wasn't indicated on the menu either) or that the \"jug\" of tiger beer was actually just four cans emptied into a jug rather than being draught. The customers were mostly tourists, so maybe their selling point is the nice decor, clean restaurant and hygiene, rather than the quality of the food.Given the number of Indian restaurants on Race Course Road and the surrounding Little India area, I'd try somewhere else next time.",

To be honest, the food here is not that cheap (and I'm not used to paying loads for Indian food), but I have to say that the food here is really worth it. I particularly loved the prawn curry because of the unique presentation and also because the prawns were so fresh. The curry was also very fragrant and thick. And last but not least, I also found that the waiters here were very friendly! They all had genuine smiles on their faces and made such recommendations. Overall, I really highly recommend this place.",

The Radhabollobi and Mughlai Paratha are vain attempts at best to recreate quintessential Bengali street food. The presentation is very good- dals come in cute little buckets, copperware abounds. Their service is a whole different story.We went there for dinner after making a reservation and were kept waiting for over 20 minutes for a table. The restaurant is tiny with no bar inside. So you are basically standing on the street during your wait. We found the place to be \u00a0severely understaffed. That too on a Saturday night! One waiter was friendly and somewhat apologetic for keeping us waiting. There was a further 30 minute wait before anyone even came to take our order. The woman who took our order was borderline rude, and judging by her attitude, probably the owner of the place (whose presence could be explained by staffing issues on a weekend night). So there we were, waiting for an hour, after making a reservation, before any food (even pappadams) appeared on our table. With prices like Mustard's, you expect some semblance of service with your meal. However, in spite of the horrible service, the food quality will probably make me try Mustard once more.",
