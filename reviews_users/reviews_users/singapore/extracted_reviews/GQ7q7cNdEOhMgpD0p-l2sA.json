    "text": "This bak kut teh broth is nice and peppery, unlike several others I've tried. I enjoy the kick of spice it gives and the ribs are juicy and meaty. There are a few grades of ribs you can choose from but the soup is unlimited refills. The table comfortably sat my party of five and our server was friendly and efficient. We ordered a few barley teas and lime juices to cool down with in the summer heat. The side dishes (well, because I treat bak kut teh as my main), including braised pig's trotter, bean curd, and vegetables were nice complements to the rice and soup. I loved the thick soy sauce and spicy sauce to dip the ribs into for an extra burst of flavor. I would recommend getting the premium short ribs or the premium ribs (longer) over the other ones although pricier because they are meatier and totally worth it.The restrooms are located outside of the restaurant (seems to be shared with other establishments?) but fortunately immaculate.",

Anyway, this place is a more full service sit down establishment than most of the food stands in the area. It's still casual, but you get table service. I ordered the namesake founder bak kut yeh, which is pork chips braised in this seasoned broth, which, I should add, one of the servers was very keen on refilling in a timely manner. I also got soy sauce eggs, Chinese donuts, fried chicken wings, and a couple tofu dishes. The bak kut teh was delicious. The meat was super tender and flavorful, as was the broth. It was delicious eaten with plain white rice. Loved the Chinese donut as well... it was cut into little piece ax which were nice and crispy. Btw, if you know what Chinese donuts are, you know one of life's travesties is when they Re served soggy. Chicken wings were crisp and juicy. The soy eggs were decent. They were a little more seasoned than my mom used to make them, but still a good addition to the meal. Didn't really care for the tofu though. I tried one that was deep fried with some sweet chili sauce. I found the sauce too sweet. Also. I should add the food came out almost immediately after we ordered, which was terrific, since I was starving. Definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "Singapore Bak Kut Teh, not too bad lah! Why? There are times where I crave bak Kut Teh and it doesn't matter which section of Singapore you step in there is always some for you to eat. During my last trip to Singapore this caught my attention. However, I picked this joint because I like the hometown authenticity that it provides. The service here are really on point, once I entered a staff member quickly seated me. If you don't just want the soup and meet, no worries, at this place you can get a great variety of drinks that suit your taste. Not bad for some ribs with ample sauces for you to choose. This is a little bit of a drive from my flat but really worth the commute if you want some nice food. Drawback: Despite food being great, the bathrooms are not in the establishment. It's advised that you go before eating here. If you are price careful, it's best that you don't stop by because it costs a lot.",

    "text": "We came to this soup/ribs shop on recommendation of a friend. Apparently, many celebs visit it as well and this shop shows that by displaying their pictures all over the walls. Their signature hot soup was flavorful and soothing to the stomach. However, I feel that this place does not live up to its hype and lacks value. What I mean by that: my friend and I each spent about 15 U.S. dollars, but all we had was a small bowl of soup with a few small pieces of dry ribs and two drinks. While it is nice that we can refill the soup, the portion is still pretty small for the price. Given that we're in the country with the cheapest Michelin restaurant (only $3 for a meal, or so I heard), I'm sure that we could also get the same bowl of soup for a much better deal else where. Not to mention, I asked for my drink with no ice but instead they filled the cup with 3/5 ice",

    "text": "Founder bak kut Teh - whose original store still remains at Balestier - has opened its second outlet, and this new branch is much welcome indeed!! With scores of pictures of celebs posing next to the beaming founder, Mr. Chua, one is reminded of how popular and well-known this humble eatery is. Founder's is a teochew-style BKT; meaning to say, the broth is peppery. However, to my memory, the broth used to be *more* peppery which I'd have preferred. But, in any case, it's still good. I had many bowls of the soup, & I'll mention more of that later. We were told that fresh pork ribs are in short supply in the industry. Founder's had to ensure the supplier provides them with only the best & freshest cuts. And one bite shows you exactly what you're paying for. The Premium BKT ($10) uses the long bone ribs. And boy, they were tender, juicy and fall-off-bone. I kid you not. So so so good. Even the regular ribs ($8, I.e. Short bone) were good too. My dining companions preferred these as they were less fatty, but I much preferred the premium ribs. Haha! The surprise of the evening was the fantastic braised pig trotter dish ($8/$10/$12). I thought it was going to be fatty but it wasn't! Again, very soft, tender and flavorful. And the gravy? Sublime. Like, yowza. Slurpsome. I was shamelessly slurping the gravy when no one was looking. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be so good. Well, there you go. The bean sprouts ($5/$6/$8) were good, although unspectacular. What you need to try, however, is the delectable bean curd skin ($3/$4/$5). This is a must-order, IMHO. Silken, soft, satisfying. Yum, yum. Tau Kee never tasted so good. And if you are so inclined, they have pig's intestines & stomach too. I didn't try the former (no, thanks!) but the latter was yummers. Haha! Don't ask me why one is less palatable to me than the other. Iced jelly rounded up our dessert and I also had the refreshing baby coconut too. The flesh was soft and sweet. Quite exquisite. What a way to end our meal! Coupled with good service, and bottomless BKT broth (yes, do not be shy in asking for it to be topped up!!), what more can one ask for?I'm glad I work in the vicinity!!!!Happy happy. :)",
