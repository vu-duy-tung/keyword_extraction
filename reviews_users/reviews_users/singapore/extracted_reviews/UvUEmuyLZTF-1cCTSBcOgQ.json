    "text": "Love burgers - and love Carl's Jr, because they're the freshest there is of the hamburger chains.I was chuffed about finding it in VivoCity and went right ahead to get an early dinner. The guy at the counter looked very stern and I pondered over the idea of walking away as I'd had the kind of day where you want to be treated nicely.However, I stayed. Only to find out that the gentleman at the counter was actually real nice. So, note to self, appearances are really often misleading. I ordered and got a number plate for my order to be put out on the table. Shortly after finding a seat I got my order from a lovely, smiley elderly gentleman. I then found a choice of free salsas and jalape\u00f1os at the same counter where you'll find the drinks machine. The burger was just right, juicy with fresh salad - something that you'll never find at McD. All in all a very satisfying burger meal if you are looking for fast food :-)",

    "text": "I'd heard about this place but have never actually been to one, namely because they don't exist in Australia (as is the case with a number of American chains). Honestly, I really didn't like it. Basically it is another one of the many fastfood burger chains that pretty much dominate the restaurant scene (though that seems to be changing for the better). The burgers weren't all that crash, and the chips were pretty average as well. Sure, they have bottomless soft drink, but once again it is soft drink, and I'm really not a fan of soft drink. In the end this is one of those places if you have seen one then you have seen them all.",

    "text": "My favorite fast food chain in Singapore!!Honestly, I am considering to give them 4 stars but it fails my 4-star test: would I go out of my way to eat here? Not really but I love it!! However, I feel that 4 stars for a cookie cutter fast food chain is over the top as they there is little real cooking involved, they just follow the corporate guidelines.But in Carls Jr case these corporate guidelines result in something super yummy, this is definitely one of my guilty pleasures and whenever I am at Vivocity (or Jurong Point) I am tempted to get a Thickburger and fries.What makes them better than Burger King or Mikey D's? First of all: the size of the burger, it is not a tiny affair , a meal at Carl's Jr always fills me up to the rim. Secondly: the quality of the burger, arguably there are better gourmet burgers available throughout Singapore but for fast food this is as good as it gets. I can really taste the grilled flavor. Thirdly and certainly in no means last: the condiment bar and soda fountain, they offer free flow salsa (both chunky and smooth), jalape\u00f1os and sauces. The only thing I am missing is ranch -but I eat ranch with everything so it might just be me who wants ranch*! The free flow soda fountain offers a wide selection of drinks way more than other chains.I love the super messy burger and fries drenched with salsa and jalape\u00f1os so three stars and major thumbs up!!*DISCOVERY OF THE DAY: you can ask for ranch when ordering and they'll hand you a tub of ranch for free!",

Carl's Jr. I used to love you but now you suck. Big time. I paid a premium for your dry cardboard burger. Do yourself a favour and go to McDonald's instead. At least you know what you're getting and you save money.",

The fries is pretty good compared to the usual fast food culprits.The patties are grilled, and a bit more moisture then McD, less charred then BK. The lettuce is probably fresher compared to the fast food joints but it could be due to timing of the day of the meal. Will I return. Yes.Photos? Probably not. The meals comes wrapped and not really displayed for instagrammers.",

    "text": "Guilty pleasure but somehow I associate VivoCity with Carl's Jr and end up grabbing a burger here more times than I care to admit.I don't remember them having fried zucchini in the past as I believe I've asked the cashiers before only to blank stares. They have them on the menu now and will even happily upgrade your fries to zucchinis as part of the combo meal for only $1.60 or something reasonable. It even comes with ranch dressing. Fried zucchini and ranch dressing go together like peanut butter and jelly, kaya and toast...who came up with this brilliant combination? Carl's Jr? If so, I praise you sir Carl.",
