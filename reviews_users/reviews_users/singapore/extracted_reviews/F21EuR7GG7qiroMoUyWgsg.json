    "text": "Tried out this place on a review by a fellow helper. One detail, it is on the 5th floor of the Takashimaya shopping center.I ordered the scallop mentaiyaki and the Kaisen chirashi don for lunch. The don was pretty good except for the tuna and salmon which were a little fibrous. This meant it wasn't the best cut of fish or it was not prepped properly. Overall it was a very tasty dish. As for the scallop it was sliced very thin and tasted amazing with a mildly spicy mayonnaise and some truffle (I think) oil. I does come across a little greasy. Other than that the dishes were very good for about US$33.",

Their other dishes are also very competent and all rather reasonably priced. Make a reservation to avoid long queues.",

I stepped in right at 9pm when they took the last order. I opted for the torched sashimi over rice, same as last time- at $26, it's a big bowl full of fatty pieces. Though anti-carb, I cannot stop eating the rice as it's the right texture and almost bouncy on my teeth. Also, the sashimi was so fatty- I had to use the rice to balance. ;) Imagine how satisfying it was.. Now, I am ready for my midnight flight home. ;p Until next time..",

Only explanation could be that they do not know there is sushi heaven behind the corner.The place was packed on a Thursday night around 7 pm, but we managed to get a seat right away. Overall, the service was super quick and food appeared almost instantly.I will join the choir and sing praise for their kaisen chirashi don: it really is as amazing as you read in the reviews (and the reviews of their other location). The fish was amazing, the slices were thick and super fresh. I had trouble finishing the normal size don (granted I had a late and rather big lunch) which is a first!Highly recommended!",

Although located quite centrally (in Taka), I had a difficult time looking for the shop as it was tucked away in a corner. We were quite early, and didn't have to wait too long for a table, so that was good! (Though I've heard it can get pretty crowded, so do try to go early!)The service was a disappointment; the waitstaff was less than attentive, and my friend had to get her own water, after asking for it a couple of times. The food however, was their saving grace. I loved their salmon aburi roll & the sauce they put in their sirloin steak; it was a nice balance of sweet and salty, and acidic. It was also reasonably priced!Would definitely recommend this place if you're okay with substandard service.",

As seen on Yelp, I went for the popular items right away - the scallop mentaiko carpaccio to share, I had the premium chirashi and my friend being a smaller eater had the normal chirashi. The premium chirashi even came with uni inside with big and plump ikura! Everything was generally very fresh, however the prawn was a bit slimy and strong tasting to be absolutely honest. Everything else was to expectation and a little above, given the great feedback all over the Internet. One thing about this place that really stuck out was their stuff which are aburi-ied (flame torched) ! Anything that they flame torched wasn't just for show. It really does bring out that extra flavour! They seemed like masters at it. Even down to the scallop mentaiko carpaccio! That smokey flavour.... I miss it already!They seem to have a chirashi bowl that is all aburi (torched on one side and raw behind)! I absolutely can't wait to go back and try that! I'm giving this outlet 4.2 out of 5 stars! Would have been slightly higher if it weren't for that lousy prawn! ;)",

The dollops of mayo on top lends it sweetness and creaminess, with a touch of saltiness that accentuates the other flavours. However, once you remove the dollop of mayo on top, the roll itself is extremely average. Though fatty and plump, the salmon itself is not particularly flavourful. The filling of avocado and crab stick and lean maguro don't contribute much in terms of flavour too. So I would say the star of the dish is the mayo! :) \u00a0There are better quality sushi options out there at a similar price point.",

Blasphemy, I know! \u00a0I find that the food selection here is a lot more extensive than the original. The Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, which in my view, is the STAR dish of this restaurant, is not available at the original location, from what I remember. Second, the Ngee Ann City space is far larger and has much more of a restaurant feel than the hole-in-the-wall experience at the original location. Third, the queue is a tad bit shorter. \u00a0In any event, the aburi dishes are the real winners of The Sushi Bar, separateing them from every other sushi restaurant in Singapore. I'm not familiar with the term \"aburi\", but from what I understand, it is essentially grilled/torched raw fish. The Sushi Bar has perfected the art of torching high quality sushi, leaving the edges burnt with the inside nice and raw. Simply, an awesome combination. In short, depending on whether you fancy chirashi or sushi, you should order either the Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, Salmon Aburi Roll or both!",

The queue was pretty long and told that we had to wait for 30 mins (on saturday night about 6:40pm) but we only waited for 18 mins. Woohoo!Anyway, we ordered their two kinda signature dishes:1. Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don $26.9This is basically the main attraction and the star of the night! The combination of torched fishes with fresh glistening pearls a.k.a ikura is just perfect! Don't forget the rice is magical too! Toppings are generous with fresh grated wasabi and sliced ginger!2. Salmon Aburi Roll $15.9Raw salmon rolled with crabstick & avocado and topped with torched salmon! Double salmons attack! Great for salmon lovers! And two non signature dishes but very delicious as well:1. Teba Gyoza @$3.5 but no minimum orderAs good as I thought it'd be! Yes, you might have guessed it, it's actually chicken wing stuffed with gyoza fillings. Creatively delicious! Me love!2. Amaebi Karaage $6.9I always love Japanese sweet prawn sashimi and The Sushi Bar definitely nails the fried version.The ambiance is pretty nice, sophisticated decor and spacious area. Perfect for casual dining whether with a date or family. It is well hidden and located at the ngee ann city (behind serenity restaurant). Price wise, I think it's very reasonable too. I'll be back.",

The kitchen shows creativity, but some dishes are good (e.g. pitan tofu, or the daikon salad which looks like a mini yusheng and tastes ok if you don't mix the awful sweet pink stuff), while others are terrible (e.g. wafu spaghetti, amaebi karaage, scallop mentaitaki cut so thinly it breaks). The portions are minuscule, so you could end up spending $70 per head before being full. At least here, they take some credit cards (not Amex), whereas the original Sushi Bar outlet at Far East Plaza (which is cheaper) only takes cash. At this price level, with minimalist service, you'd be better off going to Ginza Kuroson Takashimaya on 3/F for much better ambience and better food. People will mourn the disappearance of mid-price, varied Japanese eateries at Nghee Ann City, like Sushi Tei or Ichiban Boshi. Now, for reasonably-priced Jap, you have to go to the basement lah!",

The seating is worse than a food court with less than 10 cm between tables . If you are 2 person, there is no way you can order enough food to try as table space is limited . When asked how does one eat without space, no answers ... and they do not come back with any solution. If there is an option for no star , I would have opted for that. Won't come back.",
