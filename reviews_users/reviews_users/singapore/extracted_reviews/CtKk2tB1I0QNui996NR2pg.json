The cognac flavor can't be missed and dare I say I felt lightly buzzed afterwards. Authentic XO milky fish soup located in front of an HDB complex, this stall is filled with locals. The soup is sold by the person, and it's currently $6 for one person and $10 for two (bigger bowl). I got lots of fish meat in my individual bowl; must have been at least 5-6 chunks, which was quite worth it. There was also some token cabbage, but the highlight was the fish and the soup. Don't expect too much from the service -- the uncle doesn't speak much english, but you won't be disappointed by the food. They take orders at a table in front of a coffee shop, and the menu is almost entirely in Chinese. Usually one of the aunties will step in to help if there are communication issues, so just order swiftly and be on your way.",

Male boss usually takes orders and collects money from a table at the front of the Coffeeshop. When ordering, he makes you feel like he's doing you a favour by taking your orders. Oh well. I put up with his unsmiling face to enjoy a big bowl of yummy fish meat Beehoon soup. The soup is milky and tasty, with strong hints of cooking wine and the fish chunks are fresh too. Yes, I will return to endure fowl face for good food.",

    "text": "Formerly located at Blk 46 Holland Drive, they have since relocated to block 19A Dover Crescent. The only thing that did not change is the surly service.This place is famous for three main dishes. \"San lao hor fun\" (stir fried rice noodles and fish slices), XO bee hoon (fish slices and rice noodles in soup laced with Cognac), and \"har cheong gai\" (fried chicken with shrimp paste).The soup version of the rice noodle dish comes in a broth that is thick and fragrant, and their version of the fried chicken is rather crunchy and very tasty. (The fried chicken with shrimp paste is a bit of an acquired taste if you have not had it before). It is $1 less if you decide not to have alcohol added to your soup. However, I notice that the soup does not taste as good as before when it was at the old location. I used to be a frequent visitor to the old location at Holland Drive.Price is reasonable, but it's a typical coffeeshop in Singapore which means no AC and brusque service. There's a huge lunch crowd but that means freshly prepared dishes and better food. The number of people there for dinner is significantly less. There's a parking deck behind the coffeeshop, which makes it convenient if you drive. There are plenty of lots on the upper levels.Not as good as it used to be, but still a top choice if you happen to be in the area.",

The soup is milky but I found it a bit weird that they also put XO alcohol inside. I've tried fish soup noodle in San Francisco Chinese restaurant before but I like the one there better. \u00a0$6 you get a normal bowl and $7 dollar add some extra crab sauce or something. I especially like the Chili that came with the soup, it was a good kick in flavour add on. The environment though was quite poor and dirty, but the fan was big enough so you don't feel sweaty. This place is behind Dover Parkview at common wealth.",

Other times, you'll get an extremely friendly one who is super restaurant-proud. BUT the food is exactly how our hungry minds imagine it to be. It never disappoints. And it's affordable. We always overorder and yet the bill is relatively tiny. The last time we went, we ordered fish slice bee hoon soup, fish slice hor fun, ngor hiang, prawn paste chicken and one veg for four of us. All for about 50 bucks and it was way too much food! If not for the sake of variety and the less accessible location, I'd even bring every visiting friend from overseas there! It's a great experience given its at an HDB kopitiam.",

My sister's mouth literally Waters when we talk about this eatery.

The inclusion of XO into typically milky-to-taste fish beehoon gives a dimension to it and pairs perfectly with the sharpness of ginger in the soup. So good!But what I really like is the Ipoh Fried Hor Fun and Prawn Paste Chicken that you'll find on the tables of everyone having the XO bee hun. The Ipoh Fried Hor Fun is stir-fried with loads of beansprouts, fresh fish slices and soft kway teow (rice noodles). So good and so fragrant. The Prawn Paste Chicken is a pretty acquired thing for some because of the \"Hei Bi\" (dried prawn) taste. Acquired in the way much like Smelly Tofu is acquired. The version here is good, I like that it is not artificially red and has the aroma of the dried prawn in every crispy bite.",

I love this to bits, really.Although the boss is kind of infamous for being a bit snobbish and 'attitude', it really didn't bother me much because the food is too good to miss out! I like how the fish is so fresh and nice, and the soup is sweet and rich in flavor (from both the milk and the xo). The wait can be a little long when it gets crowded, but trust me it's really going to be worth the wait because you would want your food to be served hot! Other than their xo fish slice bee hoon, their sum lo hor fun and prawn paste chicken is also worth a try. Last but no least just a tip, it is more value for money if you order individual bowls instead of a big bowl for sharing (because there's more soup and more fish slice!).",

Add the prawn paste chicken wing to your order and you won't feel the pain of travelling all the way here just to get a bowl of great fish soup - after all, you'll be most likely to take a long lunch to eat a fish soup anyway, unless you want to get choked on the bones.",
