    "text": "Oink Don $29.00++ *Highly Recommended*We highly recommend the Oink Don, if you're very hungry, craving for quality pork and love carbs! Starting from the top, take your pick on Deep Fried Pork Cutlet w/bone, Grilled Pork Chop, Roasted Pork Belly and Pull Pork Carnita. There's so much meat here, I think an entire piglet died for this main course! In all seriousness, the meat were very flavourful, juicy, not one molecule of the variety of meats here was dry. Add on the black pepper cream sauce and every item has a tinge of smooth and delicate peppery flavor.Check out the thick layer of pulled pork carnita covering the fluffy egg and Sambal Fried Rice w/ Black Pepper Cream and Bacon! The pulled pork is the most tender, most juicy pulled pork ever, definitely took alot of time to slow cook this to perfection! Yea Baby!Sea Don $35.00++ \u00a0*Highly Recommended*This Sea Don comes with a spectacular sight of a Whole Lobster, King Salmon, Squid set above another \"treasure\", the Seafood Fried Rice w/ Garlic Butter Sauce, Prawns, Scallops, Octopus, Egg. I'll be very honest with you, the seafood fried rice is the best fried rice I have ever tasted. The rice itself has a distinct \"wok-hei\", and the rice absorbed all the sweetness from the variety of seafood cooked altogether. The crunchy prawns embedded in the rice also provide a nice bite in between the soft and pillowy rice.Enough about the rice? I could go on for days about the yummy seafood rice, but! The highlight of this dish, the Whole Lobster, showcases the high quality grade ingredients used at the Benjamins. The lobster has a sweet juice crunch and it's easily removed from the shell, a good sign of the meat being fresh. The salmon fillet is huge, it's actually longer than the bowl itself!Molten Lava Cheese Burger $25.00++Probably the next new hyper on social media is this Molten Lava Cheese Burger, served with a Choice of Fried Chicken Cutlet, Soft Shell Crabs, Beef. The soft shell crab here is also huge, I'm starting to realize that everything served here at The Benjamins is on the generous side! The cheese comes oozing on and it's great as a dipping sauce for the potato tater tots.Pizza Burger $28.00++ *Highly Recommended*Brand new on the menu is the Pizza Burger. The Benjamins takes pride in making their ingredients in-house, such as this Beef Patty, Pepperoni, served with a fusion of Black Olives, Grilled Artichoke, Spinach, Monterey Jack, Mild Cheddar. The minced beef patty has a good mix of meat, breadcrumbs, fats and seasoning making it extremely delicious and addictive. This meat patty looks to be approx 250grams.Overall : The Benjamin's continue to amaze our tastebuds and eyes with their innovative creations. Definitely try out the Sea Don, Oink Don and their smoothies, I'm quite confident you cannot find anything quite like these items in any other eatery in Singapore.",

    "text": "Cute concept, but absolutely the slowest restaurant that I can recall ever going to. After sitting menu down for 10 minutes, searching the internet, and finally just staring at the waiter.. I finally got waited on. \u00a0I drank my whole \"dirty chocolate\" (which was very tasty) and ordered a coffee, and waited again. Because of extended time for it to come, I inquired about, as well as why food had not come. I was told kitchen had orders before mine and had not come to my order. While I believe that's true, if the ratio of employees to seated customers is 1:3, they can't make much money. The coffee, I don't think was ever ordered, but they gave complimentary because of the wait. Overall, food was good but service was professional but way too slow for me to return again, except for a takeout beverage.",

Basically a plain vanilla milkshake with various biscuits and candy floss put on top. I would have loved it if the shake itself actually tasted good. Meh.",

Right when you walk into the mall, The Benjamin is immediately to your right. We shared between two milkshakes (Fairy Pebbles and Charm My Shake) and they were $16 each. Honestly, I don't think people even finish the milkshakes because my friend and I barely touched it. There was just so much going on and we basically came for the picture. Both milkshakes tasted the same and I think just the flavor of cereal and some of the topping ingredients changed.",

    "text": "Came here on July 3rd, the same day as their re-opening day after renovation. I had waffle with bacon and scrambled egg (S$18), which is not bad overall- taste wise. The texture of the scramble egg is pretty good- it was fluffy, but I just wished they give some herb or whatever into it to enhance the flavor cos it turned out pretty plain to me. For the Bacon & Waffle, we all know how easy to prepare them.. but even the waffle was just mediocre. Honestly for that price range for such a simple dish, I expected much more. The same thing with the seafood pasta (S$23). It was just ok only. I've had better. The texture of the pasta is a bit wrong - like it was over cooked. Pasta is the easiest dish to make with high margin. I'm sure that I don't ask to much if at least I want my pasta to be al dente. I could name some cafe that offers brunch places at a lower price and higher standard of food. On the plus side, this place offers free wifi, comfortable seatings with elegant & relaxing ambiance.",

Served with a side salad and fries, it was quite filling for lunch, but my boyfriend and I also split the saut\u00e9ed vegetables. They were carrots, snow peas, asparagus, mushrooms and green beans in garlicky oil - lots of flavor and delicious too!Didn't try the milkshakes but will definitely be back. They look so elaborate with pretzels, cookies, ice cream, etc. coming out the top!Nice atmosphere, really cute decor, but the service was a bit slow even though the restaurant was less than half full.",
