    "text": "I would commit murder for one of these heavenly tarts. Having tasted a whole range of cheese tarts from Pablo to KFC (which was surprisingly decent), Bake trumps its rivals by a large margin. The buttery crust is firm and manages to hold together throughout the plate-to-mouth journey. Cheese filling is the right balance of sweet & savory, which produces the most divine flavor burst in one's mouth. Breaks my heart to drop $3.50 on just ONE tart, but sometimes this indulgence is necessary! Protip: if you're getting it to-go, microwave for 3 minutes to get the cheese filling gooey again!",

Bake Cheese Tart from Hokkaido, have a crumbly exterior, fluffy inner texture, and cheesy warm soft filling!! I heard it has up to 3-hour long waiting lines. When I got there, I saw a long line outside of the bakery. But I only waited 15-20mins. If I could, I wanted to buy more but I had to be satisfied with one dozen. It is SD 3.50 per piece.It is just the most heavenly cheese tarts. One of the best cheese tart I've ever tasted. If it could last long, I would have bought several boxes to bring home. It's freshly baked, just so soft and melts in your mouth. I couldn't stop eating them. Sometimes I still dream about the delicious tarts!",

The tarts are super delicious when they are fresh out of the oven. Sinfully rich but not too much that it makes you sick. They are pretty pricey at $3.50 per tart, but well, I'm only here once a year.",

The tart reminds me of cheesecake filling that has been accidentally put inside the microwave.I refrigerated the tart overnight and it tasted like cheesecake. In the website, it also suggested to freeze the tart for an ice-cream like texture. Pretty cute concept. \u00a0The tart shell was buttery and holds up to its molten filling well. The shell was not at all soggy. Overall, this is a good tart, but it was not mind blowing. I would not queue more than 10 minutes to buy this. The start of the queue starts some distance from the store. It is under the escalator near the Royce chocolate shop. They hand you a number after you have reached the head of the queue, you walk to the store and pass your number to the person in the store and then place your order.",

(BAKE) leading the trend come 29 Apr 2016 with their first S.E.A flagship in Singapore! Located at ION Orchard, the Singapore store will be BAKE CHEESE TART's flagship store for Southeast Asia. YAY. For those not in the know yet, BAKE hails from Hokkaido, Japan, and that ensures the creamiest and smoothest cream cheese mousse in the snappiest shortcrust tart. The cheese mousse is created by blending three different types of cream cheese together - two from Hokkaido and one from France. The pastry goes through a two-step process which leaves it with a distinct crunchy yet fluffy texture. Absolutely gorgeous i tell you. \u00a0To ensure the highest quality, the cheese tarts are actually produced in Hokkaido and flown over to Singapore! Baking is done here so that we can piping hot, creamy and flowy cheese tarts. Such dedication to excellence i say. We can certainly expect the same flavor and quality from BAKE and it's even fresher than if you beg a friend to bring it back for you.For $3.50 a pop, you can dig into one of these rich creamy babies. I can't imagine why anyone would stop at 1 though! Get a box of 6 for $19.50 and share the love (WITH ME PLEASE)!",

I'm usually not a fan of something related to cheese but this is stupendous. Literally the only kind of tart I'd eat again and again in my life. It's just soooo goooood.The tarts are really yummy but the price is a bit on a high side (@$3.5) but I guess that's fine considering the tarts are flown in from Hokkaido and the rental in Ion.Now that I have tried, I really love it and crave it every moment but I wouldn't queue more than 15 minutes. I'll repurchase IF I was in the area, and no sign of long queue.",

    "text": "I happen to be in the Orchard area on a Monday morning and my first thought was \"Cheese Tart for Breakfast!\" \u00a0BAKE opens at 10am and I arrived less than 10 minutes before opening. \u00a0No one was at the queue, so I roamed to the store front to check things out. \u00a0The tarts are baking in the oven and one of the staff waved at me to ask me to queue. \u00a0When I got to the queue, there were three ladies waiting. \u00a05 more minutes until opening and about 15 more people are in queue. \u00a0A staff came out to the queue right at 10am sharp to hand out confirmation cards to the first two people. \u00a010:03am and it was my turn! \u00a0The staff looked at my baby and I and asked how many I was getting. When I said a dozen, she was like \"oh, only 12, ok, here is your card\" as if she was expecting me to buy more with a baby in tow. Thank you for acknowledging my baby as a person! \u00a0The cashier was very friendly and informed me that the tarts can be refrigerated up to 4 days, or kept frozen for up to one month! Don't microwave. \u00a0Reheat in toaster, oven or air fryer at 200C for 30 seconds to a minute. \u00a0Got it! \u00a0Out the door we go to try these babies. \u00a0By now my 20 month old is screaming \"Chee taat Chee taat.\" \u00a0I carefully peeled the sticker off to open the box. \u00a0I really appreciate BAKE's thoughtfulness in designing their boxes. \u00a0Each tart has it own \"compartment\" so they don't bump into each other and become mush. \u00a0First bite into the freshly baked tart is the crunchy crust that snaps off, then comes the warm fluffy, light and whipped cream like cheese filing that's has a hint of tartness. \u00a0The contrast of the crunchy shell and of fluffy cheese filling is heavenly. \u00a0I slurped the cheese filling down like one would with whipped cream, and finished off the crunchy crust with the next few bites. \u00a015 mins late, after I settled by baby down for a drink, the cheese tart shells are getting softer and losing its crunchiness. \u00a0Now it has become more of a soft cookie texture. \u00a0When I got home, put some in the fridge, and a couple in the freezer to try the different ways of eating these babies. \u00a0The refrigerated ones tasted just ok. \u00a0It's sort of like an over beaten cheesecake, nothing like ice cream. \u00a0While the filing is soft, it has a lot of air bubbles, so it's not creamy. \u00a0The frozen ones were more like frozen cheesecake, hard and crumbly. \u00a0 Hubby and my children tried it and no one care for the frozen ones. \u00a0So my conclusion is that the BAKE cheese tarts are best eaten right after you buy them. \u00a0Enjoy the contrast of crunchy cookie shell and the fluffy whipped filling. \u00a0Are they worth 1-3 hr wait? Nope! \u00a0If I need a cheese tart fix, the bakery across has lava cheese tarts, while not as fluffy and whipped cream like, those were creamier, cheaper, and no queue.",
