    "text": "This is my favourite Mexican Food stop in Singapore. Located in Holland Village, it's a just short walk from Holland Hills. Always a busy place, but reservations for two is not a must on a Sunday evening, so great for a spontaneous visit. To me, this is important because I favour being able to choose my dinner by actual mood and craving - I am definitely not a fan of planning days or hours ahead. My husband and me loooooooove the great tacos, burritos, guacamole and of course the margaritas here. All is super fresh and very very tasty.Staff is nice and attentive, I like them colourful tablecloths and decorations, chairs are comfy and seating is not too close - just perfect.",

Not as good as Belmonte flavor-wise, but I appreciated the side cucumber and radish salad and the refried beans. Made for a more well-rounded meal as opposed to a straight up meat and rice burrito. It's pricey.",

Salsa and chips come free.My burrito was large and freshly made, and it was average, which is to be expected from a place in Holland Village. I am not an expert on Mexican food, nor Tex-Mex in general, but the flavors here are nothing to shout about.Service here is good and prompt, and they gave me a holder for my handbag.",

And the prices were good too. Standard Singapore prices...so kind of expensive compared to other places in Asian. Overall I would probably come back here (especially for the free chips and salsa) but I'm still on the hunt for the best Mexican place in Singapore",

As pretty much everyone else said, this place is legit. I always get my steak burrito here with A LOT OF guac on the side. I love the guac so much by the way. Each portion that is meant for one person is very generous for Singapore standard so that's totally a plus, I even share it with someone every time I visit. They give plenty of meats and they are really flavorful & tender. The food is always fresh, not microwaved. Prices are a little expensive but I guess still quite acceptable considering the portion size, location and quality of the food. Customer service is AWESOME; staffs are efficient. Also free chips and salsa is always good while you wait for the food to be ready. Hence, my 1 extra star for quick service, free chips and salsa! I'll be back to try more things!",

    "text": "This is a nice option among the busy celebration street in Holland Village. If you arrive before 7, it is pretty empty and easy to get a good spot. They serve a variety of Mexican food and drinks. I tried the sizzling fajita platter. The beef was cooked well and marinated nicely. The tortillas and condiments were nothing special - not particularly fresh or prepared beyond initial purchase. This is a rare Mexican restaurant in Singapore that actually serves complimentary chips and salsa, which is a proper requirement for all Mexican restaurants in the US at least. The chips are nice and thin, while the salsa is good as well. For drinks, you can get margaritas by the glass or jug, as well as many other choices. Overall, this is a good choice for eating in Holland Village, as well as drinking, while most other bars only focus on the latter.",

Free chips & salsa, attentive staff, more authentic food, and more generous portions, as well as what I personally find a more charming ambiance.Try not to always follow the crowds. The Herds are wrong more often than not. Unless you absolutely can't stand privacy ;)",

I'd say the food is marginally better but that isnt saying much. They wont win any awards but you can get a decent burrito which is slightly over priced. \u00a0The nachos are pretty good and well loaded up. \u00a0The service is about average. \u00a0There are better Mexican places in Singapore but not in Holland Village.",
