    "text": "SSB has been making news for their hip concepts (an actual standing only outlet in Marina Bay Link Mall and the group also owns Tanuki Raw at Orchard Central) and reinvented sushi rolls such as the American and Rockstar Sushi Rolls. Price-wise, it is not exactly cheap but they do have some pretty affordable lunch sets and I tried out the Shake Batayaki Bento Set ($22++).The set consisted of a Salad, Miso Soup, 8 Slices of Sashimi (2 Salmon, 1 Yellowtail, 1 Swordfish, 1 Tako, 1 Akagai and 2 Tuna), Grilled Salmon with Butter Sauce, Grilled Mackerel, Japanese Rice and 2 Slices of Watermelon. The best part of the meal was the sashimi and miso soup, which were respectively fresh and belly-warming good. I especially loved the Yellowtail and Salmon Sashimi, though some slices were a little small. The grilled salmon on the other hand, while decently cooked, was doused with an overly-buttery and sweet sauce that made it hard on the palate, especially in the theme of Japanese Cuisine. While I do not usually enjoy grilled mackerels, I found the version at SSB to be delicious, albeit a little salty, and much preferred it to the salmon.For the full review and pictures visit voraciousappetite.wordpr\u2026",

    "text": "I know most people come here for the unbeatable Monday prices where a portion of salmon sashimi goes for SGD 3, a small glass of sake for SGD 1 and an Asahi for SGD 5. However, it gets pretty crazy on Monday nights and I, for one, really don't need that sort of incentive to visit Standing Sushi Bar. The menu is excellent, and I tend to order loads of other things besides the salmon sashimi.Some of my favourites include the grilled tiger prawn, bacon moriawase and shime saba sushi. Their salads are excellent, too, and their kyuri wakame is a real treat. Definitely my favourite spot for sushi at the moment. Despite the name, people don't stand at this sushi bar, although that was the concept they started out with. So if you're going on Monday, don't forget to make reservations!",

    "text": "If you're a salmon sashimi fan, come here on monday nights for their $3 salmon sashimi deal (5 slices). There's also sake shots for $1 and $5 Asahi beer, umeshu, and wine. It's quite a steal! But you have to make reservations though because monday nights are sure to be packed.I came here with a few mates for this promotion solely so we gobbled up the salmon sashimi almost endlessly - they were generous cuts and tasted fresh. We also had the seared salmon roll (yes we are crazy about salmon). The salmon almost melts in your mouth, it was too addictive, we had to order another plate!We stuffed ourselves with salmon to try other dishes, although the extensive menu looked really tempting. Maybe next time when there isn't cheap salmon sashimi to distract us.By the way, don't worry about having to stand while enjoying your sushi, there are tables and seats all round the restaurant. The name was probably a homage to the concept of serving busy professionals who are always on the go. You can however, find standing sushi bars in Japan.Final verdict: Outstanding sushi bar!",

    "text": "3.5* but closer to 3*Came here (opens at 6pm) after visiting the art museum on Fri. The food was fresh, so it's okay raw, but the cooked fish tasted very flat. I had the sanma, and while it wasn't bad, it was pretty blah. My friend had some mackerel in his bento, and it was pretty horrible, so I guess I can't complain since mine could have been worse, eh? :PWe also tried the fried salmon head, and it was also okay, but nothing extraordinary. A tad salty and dry-ish. But it seemed deep fried, so I guess it was meant to be that way.Also, the staff kept bugging us to take our orders. Hello? If we say give us another 5min, give us at least another 5min. Not bug us everyone minute for our order! Maybe it was because the place wasn't completely filled, and I did notice it was always a different server, so maybe it was just bad co-ordination. Still, it was annoying. Also, my set was served in a weird manner, i.e. the soup was right in the middle of the tray, first row facing me. Still, the price was okay, neither cheap nor expensive. It seems it's cheaper on Mondays, so maybe if I went then, I'd throw in another half star for being cheap.So I'd say this is just another average sushi bar. Nothing extraordinary.",

    "text": "The food here is pretty much a collection of ups and downs.I ordered the sake (or salmon. i have no idea what on earth they call it shake) batayaki bento set. It consists of 2 slices each of salmon & tuna sashimi, 1 slice each of an assortment of sashimi, grilled salmon with butter sauce, grilled mackerel, miso soup and 2 slices of watermelon. Pretty good for a $20 price tag.Lets break it down: The highlight of the set was the sashimi - it was really fresh and the quality was decent so I enjoyed most of it, especially the ika (squid), which they had a unique preparation. It lasted until i hit the maguro (tuna), which was on first sight pretty unappetizing with its dull color. Don't get me wrong, the tuna was fresh, but the taste was just that of cheap crap you won't want to see in a sushi bar. The grilled salmon was fine, the miso soup was good, but the watermelon and the grilled mackerel is rubbish.My experience was shared by my dinner companions too which felt that some things are good while others are nothing short of bad.Despite it all, I find the counter food is pretty good while the kitchen food require much more straightening up. I think this place has the potential of a good sushi bar if 2 things happen: the purveyor look out not only for freshness, but also quality and; the kitchen learns to properly season and cook their dishes.",

We just smiled. No embarrassments here, we were in our element.All we wanted was salmon... and my friend introduced me to something I'd never tried before, the salmon toro... or for the lay person, salmon belly. Yes it's the tenderer - fattier - tastier version of its standard salmon sake sashimi sibling; and it is so oishi!Standing sushi bar has deals, but I suspect if it didn't have them it would still be fairly busy. Where I think they go wrong is by having a menu trying to be everything, when really they should stick to the one thing they do well, and improve it until it is amazing... I'm talking of course about the sashimi.Would I come here again? Probably, on a discount day, when invited by a friend. Otherwise? probably not.",

They only have two pages dedicated to their specialty rolls, so the choices were extremely limiting. I tried the \"all salmon all the time\" roll and the \"eel dragon\" roll. The \"all salmon all the time\" roll had seared salmon over salmon sashimi and avocado. This roll was disappointing. There was some mysterious sauce on top of this roll that had a lemon flavor to it. It did not compliment the salmon at all. The eel dragon roll consisted of tempura and eel. This roll tasted a lot better but was still mediocre. The size of the rolls were actually \u00a0tiny as well. But these rolls were 50%, so it only cost $8 SGD for the salmon roll and $10 SGD for the eel dragon roll. FYI, the free glass of sake when you check-in on yelp is just a small shot cup of sake!",

While it looks like great value, I doubt I would come here again, for the food.The sushi was smaller than what you normally get outside, not that I'm complaining, but it might take some getting used to. It was so-so, nothing to shout about. The udon was over-cooked and mushy; mediocre, I would say. I would say the watermelon was the best part of the meal. I read through the other reviews for this place, and people come here for the promos. I highly doubt I would come here for any promo - I think supermarket sushi and sashimi are better (try Takashimaya's Cold Storage sushi). I wouldn't call crappy sushi and everything else at a very low price, value.Plus: They take Amex.",

Only thing we noticed is that the Sashimi could've been colder. Not a fan of the chef removing the salmon with his bare hands either.. but I assume his hands are clean since I did not get a stomach ache after. Lol.A friend asked me to try the Seared Salmon Roll and it was good too.Overall exp was good. But it got really crowded at about 730pm and thats when service went down. I think they are really under staffed and missed my orders a few times.I had a glass of 1dollar sake to wash it all down at the end with my hot green tea.What I noticed is that it is a little bit expensive if not for the promos. The prices on the menu did shock me a little.I'll still return though if I get another salmon sashimi craving! Bon Apetite!",

    "text": "While Standing Sushi seems to offer a great value, everything in my bento set was off. \u00a0For a little over $20, I got 8 pieces of sashimi, salmon cooked in butter, grilled mackeral, rice, miso soup and watermelon. \u00a0Let's go through them in order. \u00a0The sashimi was a mix of everything from salmon and yellowtail to octopus and clam. \u00a0While the salmon was decent, there was one piece of yellowtail that was definitely off. Fortunately, I was ok afterwards, but still it was nasty. \u00a0While the portions for the salmon and mackeral were generous, the butter had a funky taste and totally overwhelmed the salmon and the mackeral was dry to the point that it was tough. \u00a0The miso soup also had some very non-traditional veggies, which just didn't belong. \u00a0Given the options, I would spend a bit more, and eat a bit less at a number of better places nearby.",

    "text": "Chose to eat here as it was nearby another place I had to go and I regretted. Food wasn't particularly cheap, quality was very very mediocre. My garlic fried rice smelt of margarine butter instead of normal butter which was super disappointing. The natto sushi wasn't fresh and the natto tasted strongly of metal container, while the sushi was wrapped in seaweed that's not fresh. It wasn't even crunchy anymore and almost like rubber. Basically not impressive place at all, I could get better sushi at a better price at supermarkets like NTUC fair price.",

Larger parties have to wait longer to be seated \u00a0-- better if you're one or two persons.This place isn't going to win any awards -- it's sushi. I ordered from the sushi roll menu, of course, and there were about 6 choices (not too many.) However, both rolls were large with a good amount of fish,, and not too much rice. The rolls were tasty (I just kept to the sale items.)I wouldn't go out of my way for this place, but if I crave cheap sushi, this is a good place to go to.",

    "text": "$3 for a plate of sashimi? Sounded too good to be true - virtually unheard of in our dog-eat-dog, kiasu world - I decided to check it out with my mum to see if there were any 'surprises'...There were! But of the sensuous, silky smooth, thick-cut kind... On Mondays (yes Mondays only), you get 5 long and hefty pieces of expertly prepared and cut salmon... They tasted very, very fresh and my mum and I shared 4 orders. No regrets here!We also went ahead, and abused the $5-a-flask of sake deal they had. The sake was deliciously warm, heating you up from the inside after the chill-ish salmon cooled you down. Mum went ahead and ordered the Fermented Soya Beans ($5), a good serving of anti-oxidant-filled, life-prolonging, sticky tasteless clumps, with wasabi and an egg yolk on top.Wasn't meant to taste good, but we enjoyed it anyway.The Grilled Eel ($16) was a little overpriced, but the freshness and tenderness of the flesh it offered to us (BBQed right on the spot in front of us!) made us forget about the price tag (cha-ching!). Mumsy & I will definitely be back... this is a gem that's above all the Japanese chains that served everything in a croquette, deep-fried, and it should be cherished.",

    "text": "The night museum is back, my friends and I decided to check out this year's installation and one of the stops were at 8QSAM. After walking around 8QSAM, we were kinda of hungry and decided to try out the Standing Sushi Bar.It was rather late at night and they did not have any cooked food but only sushi and sashimi plus drinks. Interestingly, they have some special items to mark the event. It is called the Night Owl Maki and apparently it has a dash of red bull added to it. Well, we weren't too adventurous to try that but decided to stick to sashimi. We ordered the sashimi platter and some maki rolls together with the plum wine drinks that were on promotion, its good!  I heard that they have cheap sushi nights too.",

    "text": "Please check out my blog (on my profile) for photos :)I went on a Thursday because Standing Sushi Bar (SSB) has a promotion on mondays and thursdays for Salmon sashimi. It's 5 for $3 which is such a steal because sashimi elsewhere is much pricier, like 5 for $8.Anyway, my partner and I ordered 5 sets = 15 slices, but we ended up adding 2 more sets so we had 21 slices altogether. Is that a lot?? Hahaha idk but we really love eating salmon sashimi and SSB's salmon sashimi quality is not that impressive. But for the price it's definitely worth it!!Also tried the yakiniku don set meal, which comes with beef and saba fish, and sashimi of its own. It was $20, not very worth it considering that the fish was a really small piece, and the sashimi wasn't that fresh.Also had some of their speciality rolls and I can't remember the names but I'm quite sure we had one called Puff the Magic Dragon? It was quite yummy but overpriced if you ask me: $18.90.Overall our experience was alright cos we made a reservation and didn't have to wait. Service was also quite prompt! Be warned: without reservation the queue is quite long. Reservations also have to be made more than one week in advance.Anyway we probably won't return because it's kinda overrated :( other than the sashimi madness promotion everything else is overpriced. The price would've been acceptable if the quality was better but that's not the case. But this is my personal opinion because most of my friends are avid fans of SSB! Does anyone agree with me? Hahaha.Please check out my blog (on my profile) for photos :)",

    "text": "Seriously the Monday madness is insanely good. $3 fo 5 pcs of Salmon Sashimi (it's not super premium, decent enough but for that price are you complaining!?), $5 asahi beer and $1 sake!It's not a standing joint anymore - at least in the evening while I was there, with tables and chairs laid out like a normal eating spot. The counter gives you great view and immediate access to the sashimi and grilled skewer stuff, but the high stools and squeezy space aren't the most comfortable place to sit.Decent food, not that much cheaper than your typical Japanese food restaurant in Singapore but the Monday madness and 15% standard chartered discounts are pretty decent... plus the free glass of Sake if you check in on Yelp there! =)",
