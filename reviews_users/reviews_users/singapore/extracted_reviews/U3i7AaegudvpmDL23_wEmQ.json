    "text": "Me and couple of my buddies were in singapore for 3 days and decided to visit the arab street and try some saudi arabian cuisine . Although we had not heard much about zam zam , right after checking out the sultan mosque as we passed this place, some of the indian workers \u00a0called out to us in native tongue and urged us to check this place out.I have tried malabari cuisine in india as well (surprisingly many excellent moslem hotels in india are named zam zam, zam zam being the name of the well in mecca). malabari is remotely derived from saudi arabian \u00a0and tastes similar.Zam zam served both arabian and traditional singaporean dishes. We decided to try out the murtabak ( saudi arabian dish , (paratha) stuffed with fired onion , cucumber, tomato , lamb/beef /chicken or deer. \u00a0Since many workers were from south india , they helped us with the best out of the menu and we ended up getting a beef, lamb and deer murtabak with a biriyani and traditional sweet milk singaporean tea served with ice.It tasted so good and rich that i salivated a bit now writing this sentence. But beware it is basically super heavy food. after having one murtabak you are expected to cross a desert .We washed it down with the sweet milk tea which was not bad. but murtabak is a must try here. Its been 1 year since i visited and it still fills my senses with its unique flavor when i think about it.\"I have always wanted to eat one with grated coconut mixed with lamb in it\". probably next time when iam in Calicut, IndiaPros1. Exxxcellent food (say murtabak)2. Quick service3.Cheap4. A variety of choices5. it is basically arabia for your palate.Cons1.Crowded2. irregular seating arrangement3.Hot,sweaty4. Not the cleanest around.A must try.",

The briyani stand is worth a shot, too, and it does cost a little more than some other items, but it's a very generous portion.

Had a quick look in yelp before we decided our mind on this restaurant to satisfy the hunger of Asian food especially the yummy roti prata. \u00a0 Since it is dinner time, the only food you can order is murtabak or nasi biryani. Both are signature dishes of the restaurant. We ordered murtabak with chicken filling ($6) for a small one and a plate of nasi biryani (rice) with mutton ($6.50)... double yummy! When the foods are served we couldn't wait for another min to dig in. \u00a0Food delicious :) and there are two rooms upstairs with air conditioned so the dining experience is really great. We going to come back here for breakfast before we leave :)",

The serving is big and the chicken is well coated with their home made gravy. You can try the mutton bryani too but personally I prefer the chicken bryani as the mutton meat might be over cooked at times.Another dish to try would be the roti prata , yes how can we miss this dish in an Indian stall. The plain prata is crispy and not too oily, do request for the fish curry instead as it tastes much better than the original.Price is pretty affordable for the working crowd, value for money.",

I prefer the chicken murtabak to the beef and mutton ones. \u00a0The restaurant uses large pieces of moist chicken leg in their chicken murtabak, not the scrappy shreds in many neighbourhood stalls. Look out for chicken bones in your murtabak though, lest you choke. I've found a few small ones in mine before. \u00a0The dough is soft and chewy. \u00a0They are simply unbeatable, crispy and soft inside with liberal amounts of filling. Their briyani tastes just as good. Each moist rice grain is heavily spiced and the meat comes totally smothered in rich gravy. Portions are damn huge.The other dishes served are not as notable as their famous murtabak and briyani. Just stick to what they're good at.",

I did notice that the taste was a little bit on the sweet side compared to the Malaysian-style mee goreng which is more savory in flavor. The different is not good or bad thing, but just a difference that I noticed in the mee goreng preparation. The roti prata was passable at best-- the saving grace was being able to dip it into the side of chicken curry.",

The set up is pretty basic, but it was actually more comfortable than I expected! We ordered chicken and deer murtabak. The chicken was definitely my favourite, filled with delicious bright orange tandoori chicken. Deer wasn't bad, but a tad dry and I probably wouldn't order it again. Both were quite large and filling, definitely satisfying out craving for the kind of breakfast we couldn't get at home in Melbourne.",

    "text": "Have to say that this place actually lives up to its hype. I wasn't planning on stopping here but as I walked down the sidewalk with that \"yes I'm Tourist\" look on my face, I was being ushered into a restaurant by some guy in a blue shirt standing in the middle of the sidewalk. At first I responded with a quick \"I'm good thanks\", but then the smells and happy noises coming from inside the restaurant caught my attention. So I realized blue shirt is actually a ZamZam employee and he was there to make sure you didn't miss the restaurant. Side note: the upstairs is chilled, so ask to go upstairs if the first floor is too hot or too crowded. So I go in, ordered a feast as you can see, the fish dish covered in a spicy red sauce was my favorite. Wow that was great!! The calamari was ok, a bit chewy but missing a strong flavor, I think if it was made to order it would be exceptional. The mutton biryani.... well it appears they cook the biryani on its own then if u want mutton/lamb, chicken, fish etc that just dig the appropriate protein outta the pot and into a plate then scope the biryani over the protein. The actual rice dish was great, the lamb...meh. overall I would give the entire mutton biryani a 6.5, cheap enough to order again but wouldn't cry if they were sold out. The fish head curry, I honestly can't review. I was so full from everything else and that dish was so HUGE I didn't know where to start. I did pick a pea sized portion of the fish and I gave the whole dish to some homeless guys on the corner. Going off their facial expressions, sound effects and speed: when they \u00a0realized what they had, removing the packaging, and digging in, I would give the fish dish a 9. Maybe next time I will judge it a bit better. Overall great experience I never planned to have.",

It may look simple, but it tastes fantastic.We order different pancakes (with cheese, onions and lamb stuffed), which correctly are called Prata here. They actually rather remind me of puff pastry than pancakes. Anyway, the way of eating Pratas: you rip off a piece of them and dip it into tasty veggie, fish or meat curry sauce. What a heavenly mess!In addition to the Pratas, the Biryani is the signature dish of Zam Zam. The main component of these dishes is flavored rice. It will come with spicy roasted meat. You can also order a vegetarian version, of course. The rice is roasted with a good amount of onions, chilies and nut. Sometimes they will add a few raisins. Biryani is often served with yogurt and mango chutney.",

One night last week we caught a Fast Blue into the city and got dropped off right across from Zam Zam. We expected it to be busy and it met our expectations. However the super efficient staff found us a table on the second floor which is a little cooler than the first level. We ordered lime juice to drink along with a Chicken Murtabak and Mee Goreng. The Murtabak is one of the more famous dishes from their menu, the Mee Goreng not so famous. The food arrived quickly courtesy of the super efficient staff. The Murtabak was every bit as good as we expected, with a great curry to dip the entire extravaganza in. The Mee Goreng was so so with the chicken a little over cooked like you see in Chicken 65. The super efficient* staff brought our bill and we paid and were gone within 30 mins, wandering into the funky wonderment of Haji Lane and Arab street. We will definitely go back to Zam Zam, for sure to have the Murtabak again, and perhaps the Briyani which also seems to get excellent reviews. *the super efficient staff comments are actually meant as a compliment. It's not elegant service, but it's fast and accurate and actually of a standard you rarely see in Singapore",

It worked out perfectly since I also wanted to visit the Sultan Mosque.You can order it for take-out or eat inside their restaurant. The venue itself isn a bit run-down and the service isn't the best but their Murtabak is delicious! I ordered their SMALL Chicken Murtabak. It reminds me of \"Chinese dan-bing?\". I told the server that we wanted a small since we had breakfast not too long ago. The small is suppose to be $6 but when I saw the bill, the gentlemen charged us $8, SOOOOO I assume that he gave us the medium-sized Murtabak. It's quite filling for a party of three! (Unless you are famished, you might want to also order an additional dish). The Murtakbak comes with a dipping sauce (very watered down.. Reminds me of a curry taste) and cucumbers with some red sweet sauce (?). Compliments well with the Murtabak. I also ordered their house drink, Vanilla Kathira. You have to order it in a bottle. Reminds me of really sweet vanilla soy milk. I enjoyed it!TRY IT WHEN YOU ARE IN SINGAPORE!",

The iced tea came with limes in it which I had never had before and it went really well with the meal.I am already thinking about going back for dinner, ha!! \u00a0Definitely check this place out if you're in the Arab quarter wandering around and need a bite.

There are more tables upstairs to accommodate the diners. We were lucky to get a table at 7 pm as the rain probably kept people away. We shared the chicken murtabak and mutton briyani. Both were really good. The murtabak was huge and full of chicken pieces. I was expecting a flattish murtabak which was my experience at other joints so this was a surprise. The mutton was very tender and you could cut it with your fork. The rice was flavorful with the mutton and the gravy was just perfect too. Teh halia was another winner though if you dislike sugar, you will probably need to ask them to reduce it. For me, that is what a typical teh is. Sweet to wash down a heavy meal, and you don't even need dessert after that.",

I get that things in a restaurant kitchen need to be done a certain way to avoid having to wait ages for each dish, but for a restaurant that specialises - and is known for - this stuff, they should be able to crank them out endlessly. I keep thinking \"I'll go back and give them one more try...\" But have been disappointed again and again. As others have said, service is painfully slow, but you're not at a fine dining place here. Maybe I'll try the other mamak restaurant a few doors up....",

    "text": "Zam Zam, thank you, Ma'am. This place is right on Arab Street, directly in front of the Sultan Mosque. The specialization here is biryani and murtabak. I found the biryani to be on the bare side. It's got a good mix of spices for complexity, and although the mutton was tender and easy to peel, I've had better. Murtabak is very good. The deer option is their popular one, and it's good. It's an ideal shareable item. It's pretty bulky, and it's filling. They're generous with the meat portion inside. Also, you can try the fish head curry. My opinion? It's just okay. It makes for a good picture, but I found the actual fish to be rather tough- not as flaky/peel-able. This place has been featured on some travel programs, and it's also a popular YouTube travel vlog destination. That said, despite being a legitimate landmark mamak shop, I'll say that the food is good, but not amazingly outstanding as I initially expected. If you're from Malaysia, you probably will not be impressed, and there's a 90% chance you'll say/brag to some extent about how the mamak food in Malaysia is better than Singapore. Otherwise, this food will probably blow your tourist mind away. It's good though.",

You rip off a piece and dip it in a curry. This thing is delicious. Big time flavor and very filling. We got some mee goreng which they did a great job with too.

    "text": "We came here stranded by the rain and decided to try a Zam Zams. We got the lamb murtabak and an iced coffee. The coffee was a weak nesquick with a malted milk after taste, the murtabak for me was ok. It's the equivalent of an Indian paratha but with ground lamb inside and comes with a dipping sauce. Unfortunately I'm allergic to a spice used in the dipping sauce and my throat got itchy and started closing up which ruined the remainder of the meal for me. Not like I got much in since there was so much filling I dropped half on the way to my mouth. Next time I'd get the murtabak alone with a spatula to transport it into my mouth",

    "text": "Chicken murtabak was the best dish of the meal. It comes in small, medium, or large, and a small size is good for one person. The roti was nicely browned and the chicken was moist with lots of flavor. We also tried the fish biriyani, but the fish was rather dry and the rice was intermittently flavored -- perhaps it was supposed to be like that, but I would have liked a more complex flavor. The curry that came with it also tasted mildly of lamb, which was a bit off putting. The iced teh chio was quite yummy, but my friend said the teh c wasn't sweet enough. Also, the tea was still piping hot when they iced it, making the bottom warm while the top cold, which made for a rather inconsistent drink. Service was spotty at best -- we were sitting right by the staircase where there were constantly waiters running back and forth, yet it was almost impossible to catch anyone's attention. It's possible that Zam Zam may have been a top-notch joint at some point, but like many other restaurants, complacence and laziness took over, making the food passionless and mediocre.",

No it isn't. Stop.The mutton murtabak is fairly tasty, and is really helped out by the savory dal (complete with sheep-meat chunk to flavor it), but they really skimp on the meat, filling the pastry mostly with onions. For $9, I expect some meat, particularly in a city where $9 usually gets you full to bursting. Mutton is a strongly flavored meat, and if I have to cock my head and concentrate to taste it, you're not using enough.",

    "text": "Decent food at a fair price, service is passable.The murtabak has multiple thin layers of dough that are somewhat chewy, rather than crisp. It's pretty filling and tasty. The $7 beef murtabak is definitely a good/large sized-meal for one person. In between the layers of dough are ground beef and onion - but the flavor is fairly mild overall.I'd recommend using the fork and spoon to tear the murtabak into bite sized pieces, and then using the spoon to dip the pieces into the curry. The murtabak by itself is actually pretty mild in flavor and has a nice chewy texture. The dough is spread very thin but it has to have enough gluten to do that so the chew is nice.The curry has a mild body, isn't too heavy on the coconut, and is very dense in flavor. It's got good chili flavor, some heat, and some tang. Really tasty with the murtabak and really amps up the flavor.Skip the coffee. Seriously, not worth getting. Tastes like stale Maxwell House.The service here is a little iffy - the best tip is just to be vocal about what you want and when you want it, otherwise you'll be sitting patiently for a while.",

It's located right beside the famous Arab street, so for tourists like myself and my friend we could easily work over to explore the area right after we finished our meal. A walk is also necessary after such a carb-heavy meal. Tourists and non-tourists alike have to try this place out!",

    "text": "We were nearby and decided to pop into Zam Zam as hubby has heard much about it. We ordered:* Beef Murtabak - Crispy outside and generous inside with beef and onion bits. $5 for a small one but fills you up! Good size for the price. * Egg Onion Prata - they don't have kosong Prata so I opted for egg onion to up the flavour! Like the Murtabak, the Prata is crispy and tasty! What's particularly even more yummy was the fish curry!! It's really good that I asked for TWO more top-ups!! The Prata curry combo is power!!* Chicken Biryani - we were not hungry but just greedy so we ordered a chicken biryani to share. Great decision as the rice alone is al dente and flavourful. The chicken is with not much sauce that I initially thought it would be too dry a plate to get maximum enjoyment. I was wrong! Every mouth a delight and I ate more than I said I was gonna eat. Heh* Teh Halia - this is my usual go-to drink and theirs didn't disappoint. Thick and sweet and gingery. Just the way I love it!!!The shop itself is a visual delight. Many things to see on the walls and around. Only after the meal did I realise that they have an Aircon upstairs. And they are apparently so famous that they made their own Zam Zam signs for patrons to take selfies with. They also sell their own bottled water!! And also their Zam Zam Polo Tee if you like!!! Amazing!Well, I'm just there for the food.",
