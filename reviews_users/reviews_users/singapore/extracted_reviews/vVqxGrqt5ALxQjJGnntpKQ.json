We could have ordered another round of the #beefmarmaladeandpickles #perfection. Love that most of the meaty dishes can be ordered by the 100g portion meaning even 2 people can #shareplates and have variety. Intimate space, good service e.g. We were warned of the 45min wait for the rumpcap",

    "text": "Ugh. So good. I practically loved every single dish we got. I had been wanting to come here after having it recommended to me so many times... and I finally did! :D so without further ado, here's what we had:Smoked quail eggs white truffle - it's good, but for the price of $12 PER EGGS i wouldn't get it again. i thought they'd at least give 2-3 eggs for that price, but no. it was really $12 for a spoonful of quail eggs and truffle - yummy, but not worth the price tag!Squid, sweet corn and paprika sauce - this is an excellent dish. i was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and soft the squid was, and the spicy yet sweet creamy paprika sauce. even the slightly charred green onions that was probably just a garnish (but I ate anyway) was tasty as hell.Onglet, onion and bone marrow - soOooO sooooo good. the chef came out and showed us the meat before it gets cooked, but i was too busy eyeing the wine list so i didn't pay too much attention. they didn't bother asking us how we'd like it done, but it came out just perfect. the meat was perfectly seared on the outside, and so juicy and so pink-tender on the inside.Burnt End's Sanger (pulled pork burger) - ok, could you tell I saved the best for last? cause I totally did. this was so good that when I first bit into it, I practically trailed off whatever conversation I was having, and all the excellent dishes we had before hand just seemed to pale in comparison. and then we got seconds - it was THAT GOOD.Banana with Caramel - this was a lovely dessert, though not much could be said about it because i was still in shock after the sanger - i felt like it really stole the show for me....anyway, i digress. the banana was nicely done and flavorful, though i feel like at that point i could have gone without dessert. thankfully it wasn't massive or anything, so we didn't struggle with it.Totally would come back here again - there were many dishes that caught my eye that I just didn't have the stomach space to try.Update (Feb 5): went back and had the following dishes:- uni with cauliflower sauce- leeks, hazelnut- corgette- toast and tomato with pancetta- sanger- flank, onion and marrow- banana caramelWill update properly when i have the chance.",

I thought the food was ok, but not exceptional. Had the tomahawk pork, the beef (tenderloin?), sanger and a few other dishes. The only dish I found remarkable was the almond-onion-something salad. The meat dishes I felt were meh, and the sanger had too much \"wet coleslaw\", not to mention it was on the salty side. The wine selection is good, both in terms of quality and the decent mark-up.",

    "text": "Burnt Ends makes the barbecue an exquisite affair. You wouldn't expect barbecued fare to be this polished, but Burnt Ends' mastery of the grill is inimitable. Prices are a little steep, considering the tapas portions of most dishes, but well worth it.Service was extraneously amiable and chipper in attitude, as Burnt Ends doesn't charge for service. And because the menu was impossibly succinct, scant almost, the staff's fair grasp of the menu helped inform our choices.We had:1) Smoked Quail Egg ($15 each) - topped with caviar: the minuscule mouthful costs a pretty penny, but wow was this glorious. I finally get why caviar is prized as a delicacy. These inky black pearls lent a plush briny counterpoint to the nuanced smokiness of the perfectly soft quail's egg. An absolute can't miss. 2) Tomato Toast & Lardo ($18): looked rustic but was exquisite. The blobs of tomatoes, lightly torched on the grill, were bursting with an incredible sweetness.3) Beef and Mustard ($18): my favourite version of beef tartare ever. It was clear and refreshing, the bite of the mustard restrained the rounded body of the beef.4) Burnt Ends' Sanger ($20) with pulled pork shoulder, coleslaw, chipotle aioli, and melty cheese sandwiched between a pillowy sesame seeded brioche bun: TO-DIE-FOR. Best pulled pork burger I've ever had in my life. In fact, best burger I've had in a long time. I'm still dreaming about it.5) W.A. Marron ($90) accented with kombu and gilded with tobiko beurre blanc and chives: sumptuous and succulent.6) Onglet ($35.10 for 150gm at $26/100gm) topped with burnt onion and slathered in the most divine marrow jus: Decadent and heart palpitatingly sinful but so wonderfully superb.",

Not v likely bc there are other places for decent food in SG. I wouldn't say I was let down, but I did expect more from an outlet tied to Andre Chiang. At this price level, service was average. The food was good but not amazing. Simple ingredients were cooked well. Had I not ordered the ribs or sangers, I would've left annoyed as I didn't see much creativity such as Lolla or Bochinche.

    "text": "surprisingly - and I mean that in the best way - good modern offerings at this new(ish) restaurant. I used modern because I am lax to use fusion - which often has negative connotation - this place serves up what I think is a very contemporary style of food: it straddles both eastern and weatern flavors perfectly well, and meshes elements and techniques to a cohesive and (if done right) enjoyable result.n.b. if you know a less rambling way to descibe that manner of cooking, I'd be well-pleased to hear it.competitively priced, enjoyable food with some standouts, a lovely restaurant and kitchen theatrics on show, this is my thursday recommendation for friday (or any day) date night.we were on a gander through keong saik friday night when we decided to pop in and try our luck - the first to arrive on the tail of someone's canceled reservation, so we scored a seat at the counter. it's a lovely space - intimate and exclusive. there's also something infinitely pleasing about watching your food being prepared before you.we started with the truffled quail eggs - really just soft-centred boiled eggs sprinkled with tiny truffle shavings and salt: alright, though nothing particularly alluring. the sea urchin atop cauliflower mousse was quite tasty - rich, soft uni atop the mousse, with tiny pearl-type seaweed for contrasting texture. the salmon roe atop crispy fish skin was more in line with what I expected from this place - the best way to eat this is to smear the eggs evenly atop the surface, so you get a bit of salty fishiness in each bite - pretty delicious. the mains here are expertly executed - it has a lot to do with that large oven (and grill ) they operate - the food comes full of delicious smoky flavor, perfectly cooked and tender inside, but with a delicious maillard-ed crust outside. take the fish collar - I forget the species - a large white with a blackened crust, cooked flaky and tender, juicy inside and well-seasoned; and well-complemented by the crunchy mixed seaweed. the onglet was similarly impressive - marbled beef in a dark jus, topped with sliced bits of marrow. that marrow was meltingly soft and heart-stoppingly (perhaps literally) rich; and you don't get to specify the doneness of the beef here, but it's no matter - it came pink and tender and beefy.\\and we finished with dessert: the recommendation of the warm apple was sweet, dark pieces of cooked fruit below a scoop of vanilla ice cream, topped with nuts. so comforting and delicious - a bit like grandma's dessert grown up.the food was of a consistently high standard (which might or might not be attributed to its pedigree), and it was well pleasing (especially for a restaurant that serves modern cuisine) that portions were fair and satisfying and prices actually reasonable. well-recommended, and a star amongst the new establishements. reminds me a little of the market grill - though this place is a little more sophisticated.p.s. they serve a suckling pig! up for advance order, and someone must have, because I saw the pig (not metaphorical) at the back. I think it's worth an order, because they hack it up and throw it on that impressive grill before serving - which must make for some deliciously charred skin and meltingly soft meat.",

    "text": "Wow, what an impressive restaurant and such a fun and interesting dining experience. Walking in, I felt like I was walking straight into a well organized barbeque party as opposed to a regular restaurant. This takes the open kitchen concept to a totally different level. The oven and open grills are directly in the line of sight (really, the focal piece) of the diners. It really takes you right into the heat of the action, pun intended. We ordered the following:- smoked quail eggs: This was a wonderful starter and had a deep, smokey flavour. The eggs had an almost translucent, jelly-like exterior and a runny yolk. Loved the unexpected smokiness of the eggs. A nice introduction to the running \"smoke shack\" theme of the restaurant.- squid, sweet corn and mild paprika: the squid was sweet and succulent. Loved the flavours and the crunchiness of the corn against the soft flesh of the squid. Enjoyed the plating, with the wild pop of colours. - fennel, burrata and orange oil: very interesting to watch the blackened fennel come out of the oven. It was completely \"burnt\". Sous chef will slice the fennel in front of you, revealing the perfectly grilled fennel inside. - onglet, burnt onion and marrow: the star of the show. the piece de resistence. The sear on the steak was perfect and crisp and so tender insider. It was charred to smokey perfection and tasted amazing. The natural flavours really came through; delicious.- butterhead lettuce, shallots and vinaigrette: don't belittle this side dish and do yourself a favour and order this! I enjoyed this very much as it was possibly the only dish that was not grilled or placed in the oven (or was I wrong?). The very fresh, cold and crisp lettuce provided the perfect complement to the grilled and heavier dishes. I'd say that it's an essential order and really helps to balance out the oil and fat of the other dishes. - banana and caramel: this was a small banana burnt on the outside and caramel ice-cream on the side. A smokey and sweet ending to the meal. The meal went full circle, starting out with an unexpected dish of smoked quail eggs and ending off with a grilled banana. I liked how the smoked theme played throughout the entire dinner and this really did justice to the restaurant's name.It was also much fun watching the Chef David and his crew in action and feeling like you're part of the action in the kitchen. \u00a0I thought it was genius that the kitchen did not require any frying. Everything was done on the grill and in the oven. That's altogether brilliant and daring. We arrived on a Thursday evening at around 7 pm. No queues then and we were seated straight away. Service was good too. Overall, an enjoyable evening, albeit a smokey one as we came home smelling like barbeque which was of course to be expected!",

    "text": "First of all, I have to specify that this review is based on my lunch there, not dinner. We started with the crackling and mustard, which is pretty much pork rinds with a mustard dip. I wasn't too impressed with it, except that the mustard was pretty good. Plus the fact that I saw them pull out the crackings from a tupperware, and it was served cold. Would have been much better if it was freshly fried. We had the sea urchin with cauliflower, which was 10 bucks a spoon. The uni was relatively fresh, and I liked how the black garlic and caulifllower puree complemented the sweetness of it, but it wasn't overwhelming good and didn't think it was worth the price tag. The grilled kingfish collar was as good as grilled kingfish kama gets, and I liked the green apple slaw that came with it. The pulled pork slaw burger was probably the best dish of all, with the juicy shaved pork and pickled slaw served with a hot brioche bun, albeit a tad heavy. I guess I came with great expectations, and I felt that it didn't deliver.",

    "text": "We went with the Omakase style (or rather, my friend ordered the omakase) so we managed to try out most of their dishes. The restaurant seating are mostly counter seats, and from there you can have a great view of the chefs scurrying across the kitchen preparing your meals. Sitting there also means you get a chance to interact with Chef Dave Pynt (and his extremely hot sous chef I think).The only problem with an open kitchen, as well as the background music, was that I couldn't hear much when the chefs introduced the dishes. For most of the dishes I didn't even know the names, really...But what I can highly recommend: - The BURNT ENDS SANGER (pulled pork burger). It was extremely juicy and flavourful, the only pity was that we had to share it among us friends. I could eat the whole thing by myself for sure! This is one of their signature dishes.- Blackmore's Cube Roll. I think this is steak that we ate. Done medium rare, it was well grilled and seasoned, and the quality of the meat was obvious. The only con to this was the almost $140 price. This is one of their signature dishes too.- Alaskan King Crab and Garlic. Oh man, the king crab was very well cooked over the garlic sauce. The sauce was well prepared, no taste of bitterness at all. Dip a piece of sourdough bread in it and devour it. Savour every last bit of the sauce. Surprisingly, this is coming from a restaurant known for their meats.If you haven't eaten at Burnt Ends, reservations (as of this past weekend) are filled till September. Talk about a long wait!Pros:- Great view of the kitchen and chefs working- Amazing food really, they are known for their meats- Good and warm service from both chefs and floor alikeCons:- Might be considered expensive; Our bill came up to about $150 per pax- Long reservation wait, if you DO manage to get it- Noisy restaurantant",

    "text": "Burnt ends is a spot that I walked in with extremely high expectations towards, with recommendations coming from multiple fronts. My gf and I dined at Andre previously and Burnt Ends was mentioned highly even from their staff so we took the plunge and made the reservation, preparing ourselves for eating some MEAT.We had the early 6 PM seating on a Wednesday so arrived right at 6 on the dot and had the first two counter seats. The ambiance immediately strikes you as a cool and hip place with old school punk rock music playing and young chefs hailing the kitchen. The open kitchen + counter seating setting is always a plus, allows you to watch and wow over the entire process from the moment you order your food, to it being announced, to preparation, to cooking, to serving. Each of their 10 visible chefs with different roles and stations - totally makes for one incredible experience even before you taste your food.We ordered the following:1) Leek with hazelnut and black truffle - nice tasting and perfectly grilled leek except was way too salty for my taste. This is subjective yes but even in being lenient, this was a bit much. The black truffle was even overpowered by the salt.2) Garlic shoots and gremolata - Great starter. Not too overwhelming of garlic.3) Fennel, Orange and Burrata - Loved the fennel and burrata but the the orange syrup was a bit too artificial tasting and didn't seem to belong. It took away from the freshness of the rest of the dish for me.4) Burnt Ends' Sanger (Pulled pork shoulder, home made cole slaw, home made chipotle aioli, brioche bun) - Loved this. Can eat 4 of these.5) Suckling pig for 2 - Good but be prepared to work! Excellent flavor from the charcoal grill.6) Burnt Ends' Sourdough - Your typical sourdough.Overall the food was nice. Definitely worth a shot but unfortunately I wasn't wow'd by any means. The Sanger was excellent and I'm sure they can make a shop purely from these. I also took a star off because of their lacking dessert and cocktail menus. Not sure if they are hoping people only eat and get out kinda thing but with the kind of setting that they have in there, an awesome cocktail and creative dessert would go long ways to make the place and experience totally memorable.Otherwise, I would recommend you check it out. I know I'll be back to checkout their new menus in the future.",

    "text": "Definitely recommend the chefs tasting option. They served us highlights form across the menu, including some items that were not even on the main menu. The roasted quail was incredible. Leeks with black truffle, incredible. smoked quail egg with caviar, incredible (duh). King Crab. Beef Marmalade. Roasted corn... my mouth is watering. Drink service was awesome as well. Great cocktails and aperitifs. The wine list was really carefully curated from Australia. Unique small producers shined on the list. We did sort of a tasting across the menu since we don't really know much about Australian wines, and the drinking was about as good as the eating.The service in general also stands out. Many staff ensuring the water was full, checking to ensure we were enjoying, clearing our plates, new silver etc. I broke a wine glass on accident right when we sat down and they were right there to sweep it up and re-set the table with new water glasses, silver etc to avoid any glass shards getting in the food. (sorry about the glass!)10/10 would do it over again without hesitation.",

    "text": "Burnt Ends, owned by chef-restaurateur Andre Chiang is currently ranked No.14 in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2016. With Australian Chef Dave Pynt on the pass, Burnt Ends have caused quite a stir in the Singapore food scene with their incredible barbeque.During my trip to Singapore, I did not have the intention of visiting this restaurant and therefore did not make any reservations. But when I was looking at Singapore's Burpple Top 100, Burnt Ends was at the top and I just had to give it a try one way or another.With only 17 coveted counter seats, it was quite a challenge to secure a place in their restaurant. So when I tried to make a reservation during the same week, of course they were fully booked. Luckily, there are walk-in options for people that could not get a reservation.When we arrived, we were fortunate enough to snag two seats right at the end of the counter! We were so thrilled to try out what they have to offer.The way Burnt Ends operate differs from other restaurants. Approximately half of the counter seats oversee an open kitchen that is dominated by a four-tonne, dual cavity oven fired by fragrant apple and almond wood. You can also feel the hustling vibe of all the chefs and watch them as they skillfully prepare your food. I wished we were seating there instead. It would have been a totally different dining experience.We were very satisfied with the food as well as their service. Too bad there was only so much we could eat (and limited funds). There was so much more that we wanted to try on their menu - their Squid, Venison, King Crab, Seabass, it all sounds really good! They have clearly mastered their barbecuing technique and their dishes are very affordable. Until this day I am still dreaming about their perfect-rare onglet steak. I look forward to return to Burnt Ends again.",

    "text": "Love the smokiness of the food. My friend did as well. The queue is fairly long so be prepared to stake it out We both loved the intense beef marmalade. The burnt sanger didn't live up to the hype for either of us. My friend also adored the fennel. I personally felt the fennel flavour was good but the actual fennel didn't have as a strong flavour as expected. I put it down as Singapore not having a great produce selection. The fennel was also a touch over smoked/burnt. The rump steak had an amazingly reduced onion puree. It was a perfectly balanced condiment to the beef. The suckling pig was probably the most underwhelming. The cider reduction was great but there wasn't a lot of it. The skin was nice and crispy. I loved the skin. The pork itself felt a little under seasoned. It was cooked very well but that was all to it. It felt like a slight dissapointment after all the other food we had.I dare say that burnt ends will continue to draw in the crowds!",

    "text": "Burnt Ends proclaims itself as a modern Australian BBQ, and the star of the show is certainly the grill and flaming oven. \u00a0But then again, Outback Steak also proclaims itself as an Australian steak house, but the two comparisons couldn't be further apart (thankfully). In a modern and minimal room, most of the seats are on the counter, with a few tables in the back. \u00a0The menu follows the current trend where you list only the ingredients. \u00a0So for our first course \u00a0it was simply listed as leeks, hazelnut, and brown butter. \u00a0And sure enough, that's what we got, but it was completely awesome - the leeks were grilled perfectly and sweet and tender, while the hazelnuts provided an excellent counter, and all swimming in a rich yummy bath of brown butter. \u00a0The Sanger was also one of the best sandwiches I have had in SG, \u00a0It's basically a pulled pork with cole slaw, and aioli which was super messy but on par with some of the better bbq sandwiches I have had back in the States. \u00a0The lamb with harissa was good, although my chop was a little grisly. \u00a0Do get a steak - even the cheapest version, the Onglet, is very good. \u00a0It's basically a hanger steak that is grilled perfectly on the rarer side, with bone marrow and a very rich sauce. \u00a0Service is efficient and competent. \u00a0My only complaint is that I would not serve a Belgian Abbey ale in a tall glass, but it's a minor issue and one that could be remedied with a wine glass (not perfect but certainly an improvement over a tall glass). \u00a0 \u00a0Anyway, DO make a reservation. \u00a0The place is small and fills up quickly, even on a Wednesday night. \u00a0And definitely try veggies as well as meats, as they handle both deftly here. \u00a0And they also have quite a few barrel aged cocktails, which I will definitely have to hit up next time. \u00a0The little plates can add up pretty quickly, but it's definitely worth it.",

There is no functioning online reservation either so we had to play by chance by showing up without a reservation. This alone knocks down the rating...even if they are full up for the evening then at least answer the calls to inform patrons.Once we arrived (about an hour after dinner shift started), the place was bumping with people and music. Had a nice trendy vibe and decor and was exactly the type of atmosphere we had expected from the reviews. There were a couple small tables outside (both occupied) and what seemed like no vacancy inside. We asked the hostess if they had an availability for 2? She was helpful and said she'd look around. While waiting we took in some of the ambiance and surveyed the whole restaurant. The floor plan of the dining area was blended tastefully in with the kitchen, very open. The chefs were busily preparing the meals right in front of the customers. When the hostess returned, she mentioned that they only had room at a narrow steel-mesh bar adjacent to the entryway. The mesh bar sat about a foot off the wall and with black painted steel bar stools had about 5 place settings. I'm not a big fan of this type of seating for eating but for a bar it would be ok. This actually is the other reason the rating is knocked down. The mesh bar was too tight and I felt a bit uncomfortable with such little space. I mean if we're gonna drop 150+ on a meal at least design some better seating solutions.",

Firstly, no reservations so you have to go and get in by 6pm to try to get on the waiting list. Then you have to scoot off somewhere to have a drink or kill time. We had to wait for 1.5 hours to be seated at the side tables facing the wall. So you can't see any of the kitchen action and they were the most uncomfortable stools and tables. Unbelievable how they maximise space and charge the prices they charge and have such seats. I get it that Singapore space doesn't come cheap but still???Food was unimpressive. We had the smoked quail eggs, cauliflower dukkah (which was the most impressive dish we had that night), onglet steak with marrow, the brioche with bone marrow. The steak did not impress at all and we both felt at the end of the meal that it wasn't worth it at all. Will certainly not go back for another meal.

Manager says come early, resto opens at 6, and they might be busy from 730, so we made plans to get there EARLY.It's 6.30, and we're pacing our walk to the resto - we didn't want to get there too early, lest we appear too eager... I lie, I really couldn't be bothered about appearing eager. After all, I was showing up on opening night, 30 minutes after they open their doors for service. And we weren't even the first ones there. Oh well. Silly accolade aside, we got down to the menu, and watched the crew work in front of us. Yes, it's one of those counter-seating placers where you get to see everything happen in front of you, and it forces the crew to be ultra clean, and ultra deliberate about every step.Yum points to the warmed oysters abd baby eggplant; the latter blackened to tasty perfection (everyone needs a little char in their lives) and with a touch of sambal on the side (with hae bi!). We also shared the roast suckling pig, which was crazy delicious- crispy crackly skin, with super juicy flesh, and Chef Dave shared that since they didn't want to take away from the pig's natural flavour, he'd let us salt the dish ourselves. Smart man.Dessert was an ice cream sandwich - really, chocolate ice cream between two brownies, and the smoked ice cream with wild hibiscus, which was a very interesting end to the night. Go ahead, imagine smoke, in ice cream, in your mouth. The come here and get all those pre-conceptions blown away.",

I didn't make reservations and was lucky to find seating for two even though it was late during their lunch time. I highly recommend reservations.Even though we were seat away from the kitchen half, it's a nice touch to see Chef Pynt and his excellent staff do their thing. The service was excellent and very friendly.I wasn't sure what to expect from Australian barbecue, but it did not disappoint. The Burnt Ends Sanger I think is best described as a friggin delicious twist on the pulled pork sandwich. The Cube Roll steak was also exquisite. Quail eggs were good also.Not sure I will be making many more trips back to Singapore but there's a very good reason some rank this as one of the top restaurants in the region.",

    "text": "The food is excellent, let me just put it out there. If you're surfing for a place to eat on a Friday date, hurry up and go down now and chope a table (or make a reservation if you can eat at 6.30pm). The service we received however, is what made me dock a star.Let's start with the happy stuff first aka my stomach. We had the fresh pearl oysters to start. That's right, fresh and cold, not warmed (why would you warm these babies?!!). I haven't had such fresh, non-grimey, smooth tasting oysters in my life. I don't know what the chef did while he shucked these babies but man. Oysters!Then we had the grilled courgette show up with the Sanger. Think slices of perfectly grilled courgette with lovely waves of oven hei wafting in your mouth, followed by a thick mild cheese and a puree-ed vegetable 'sauce'. The pulled pork sandwich was tender, sandwiched between a willowy bun made by I'm guessing the stern looking baker lady who paced up and down to the ovens where her sourdoughs were baking. The sandwich was well sauced and had a good dose of cabbage but I *have* to say, the sauce was a little flat. It had some spice and perhaps a mayo base, but \u00a0lacked the smoke or sweetness you'd get in the South or at Smokey's in Singapore. Same same but different (interesting) take. Between these dishes and the next 2, we waited more than half an hour before realizing the servers were waiting for us to finish the burger. I was dying from hunger and it was only when I asked the waiter why 1/3 of our table got their food, did we realize there was some systematic course. Given that the menu isn't labeled as such and our host was politely *not* eating his Sanger, I'm going to bluntly say the waiters should have used their brains and asked why our plates weren't moving. Mind you once we figured this out, the kitchen still had to cook our food and we waited another 15 minutes. So the last 2 dishes were the flank steak and the king crab. The flank tends to be a cheap cut, not so much fat, since most cows have well exercised abs. This steak was grilled perfectly medium rare with some bits of fat left on top for good measure. Why would someone torture me like that? The king crab was the weakest part of our meal and word of advice, not the best thing to eat when you're having a business lunch. It wasn't bad per se, but somehow a crab leg with fibrous meat doused with butter and a squeeze of lemon didn't quite knock my socks off (now the shrimp at Blu however...).All round great food. The open kitchen is also hugely entertaining, especially when a table sent back their steak because someone messed up. Think Gordon Ramsay action without the f words yelled out loud. I saw one sous chef taste off a common spoon after putting the finishes to a plate, and place the spoon back in the common utensil basket. I squirmed for a second, but since it wasn't my dish up next, got over it. So yes, don't expect intelligent service and you'll have to push them abit if you're on work time. Otherwise, the food coming out of the kitchen is amazeballs.",

Open kitchen (a sign of confidence from the chef) and everyone is sat around the comptoir overlooking the kitchen...menu is revised and changed daily... Everything on that piece of paper looked fantastic to me... Everything is super fresh, they'll even tell you when they run out of ingredients for each dish.. These guys do NOT do bulk or industrial cooking... The starters are the stars of the show... There is nothing on there that you wouldn't fancy... It's just unreal how they can ace 2 dozens different dishes everyday... I've been to many amazing places and had amazing food experiences, but I can confidently say that if I was ever to live in Singapore, this place would be one of my weekly regulars...If you love great food you'll want to marry this place..

When your reservation (that you make 3 months in advance) says \"bar seating\" what they really mean is wall seating. Your seat is an uncomfortable bar stool at an iron grate shelf facing a wall. When we asked if there was any other options the hostess rudely stated that was what our reservations were made for. Fine. Seat us then. Our cocktails were weak and when we asked for a dirty martini, we were told they only brine they had in the restaurant was jalape\u00f1o brine. We tried several starters, Grissinni (simple and tasty), Jerk chicken (pass - it was a super fatty piece of chicken smeared in mayo) and the Beef Marmalade (which was the best dish we sampled). The Marmalade was delicious. We also tried the Sanger sandwich (while good, it was missing an element of flavor). Maybe some spice could highlight the flavors? And last we were recommended to try the venison. Unfortunately the venison was brought out with little actual meat and instead a huge bone that apparently accounted for the majority of the weight that we paid for. I expect more at this price point and for the hype. What a huge disappointment. Save your money and get some actual quality food elsewhere. I would have preferred roasted meat from a Hawker stall.",

We were bummmed, but figured we would still give it a shot when we were in town. We were able to walk right in with no wait! We were seated at the high top tables, but if we had chosen to wait an hour we could have had regular seating as well. If you are in town without reservations, I would still give it a shot bc it was so worth it! If you have a choice, go with the table top seating.....you can watch the magic happen. Cocktails were phenomenal (one has burnt sage on top-super fragrant), and we really loved the small plates and sharable plates. The Jacobs Ladder (meat from between the ribs) was fatty and delicious, and had a great mustard sauce. The jerk chicken with the citrus cream sauce was also fabulous. The pulled pork sandwich was huge and had a ton of flavor. The king crab with brown butter was a delicious main course, decent amount of crab and the butter sauce also had capers (yum!). We are so glad we took a shot and were able to walk in and experience this place on our one night in Singapore.",

    "text": "My husband and I had the pleasure of dining here during our visit to Singapore. After reading so much about it prior to our visit in our nerdy tourist book, we felt it is a definite must try! We read many reviews about how difficult it is to get a reservation here. Indeed.. I tried calling a couple times from our hotel and no luck. I think it may be an online reservation only?? Not sure. Anyways, we took our chances on a Wednesday evening to just walk in and hopefully the wait wouldn't be too long. \u00a0When we arrived, the hostess said it would be 45 minutes by the bar area against the wall. The bar area by the kitchen is definitely more appealing to the eyes as you can see the chefs and bartender working their magic. The restaurant itself is quite small, so I can understand why it is difficult to get seated here. We strolled around the streets a bit and returned 45 minutes later. There were 5 seats by the bartender vacant at this point, but the hostess said it's reserved. We waited a little longer but the guests by the wall bar were still seated. The hostess then informed us that the party that was to be seated by the bartender canceled, so we got some pretty good seats there! We ordered a couple drinks, and the bartender was a true artist at his craft! Some of the best drinks we've ever had! We ordered 3 appetizers which came out promptly one after the other. Each one was more delicious than the one before! My husband had ordered a steak which came out quite late.. at that point we almost didn't even wait for it. That is why I docked off a star from my review. Sadly we didn't feel that the steak was nearly as special as the appetizers which were truly the star of the dining experience. The lamb tacos and the beef marmalade were our favorites. We also liked the pulled pork sandwich. Nonetheless, the dining experience was truly memorable and I recommend you pay this place a visit. People were complaining about prices in their reviews, but coming from LA, it really wasn't too different, it was actually cheaper than a lot of the fine dining we've had in LA. My advice would be to skip on the steaks and order a bunch of their delicious meat appetizers :)",

The day before I checked its website, and was able to make a reservation for its counter seat. As I was one of its first customers of the day, I was able to get the first seat next to the cashier, with a great view of the open kitchen. Smoked Quail Egg and Caviar ($12+)Gone in a mouthful, it was an exciting moment in the mouth, although one could not help feeling that it was quite expensive for an egg.Duck Hearts and Peri Peri ($8+)I was not quite a fan of duck hearts and expecting it to be quite spicy, but it tasted chewy with a hint of spices.Beef Marmalade and Pickles ($14+)Very nice with the freshly cooked marmalade on the toast, but a tab messy to eat.Burnt Ends' Sanger ($20+)Pulled Pork Shoulder, Cole Slaw, Chipotle Aioli, Brioche BunI had this takeaway after looking at most other customers having it. It was huge and packs lots of meat in it with lots of flavours in it. Almost could not finished it.Onglet, Burnt Onion and Bone Marrow ($32.10+)I like that the steak was served sliced which made it easy to eat with a fork. I was not a fan of bone marrow due to its gel like appearance but it tasted great with the meat.Berry Tart ($12+)It was the dessert item of the day. Served with chantilly cream, although I wish there was vanilla ice cream to go with it. Looked simple, it tasted quite good without too tart. I like the part just before the crust which gave a kind of chewy bite.Overall food was great. Although the counter seats were full, the place was not too noisy and just nice for a meal.",

    "text": "Even though I've heard so much about this restaurants, it took me almost a year before my husband chanced upon it while looking for late night supper. We were greeted by servers with a strong Australian accent, \"Howdy mate\", and saw that the restaurant was still packed at 11pm. We managed to get the last two seats at the counter (basically the entire restaurant are counter seats) and was told that only the pulled pork burger was available as their restaurant was closed. So that saved us from making choices. My husband then asked if they had fries since I wanted some with my burger. Sadly the kitchen was closing so they didn't have any but we got the beef marmalade instead. In short, food was amazing! The beef marmalade was remarkable. Shredded beef in wondrous flavor on a crispy piece of bread. Pulled pork burger is probably a good portion for a main meal but perfect when we shared it for supper. The flavors were again a delight to my tastebuds but I have to be honest the pulled pork could be a little more tender. Probably a 8/10 execution for the burger and 10/10 for the beef marmalade. We also ordered a smoky cocktail - the bartender burnt the sage. It was lightly sweet and not overwhelmingly strong. A great experience overall and I am definitely curious to be back to try their other main dishes, which by the way, rotates frequently. Reservations are only taken for dinner seating between 6-630pm, and walk ins usually have an hour to two wait. Or you could wing it like us, come by for a late night supper dish!",

Let me tell you it was excellent from beginning to end. \u00a0First of all the staff is incredible. \u00a0Sheena who made our reservations was amazing. \u00a0She knew we were coming to celebrate our honeymoon and she made every effort to get us a seat at the main table. \u00a0She is so nice! Next the bartenders made some excellent drinks. \u00a0There was a new bartender there, literally his first day, but he was very polite and knowledgeable and was able to make the drinks we requested. \u00a0The head chef was super kind and came by personally to welcome us and made us a meal we won't forget. \u00a0Everything was perfect, with the exception of a small hiccup where our steak dishes were cold but they quickly fixed this by taking it back and making us new ones. \u00a0They even also comped us dessert and the steak because of this error which we appreciate! Dessert was great too. \u00a0Overall a great experience and we can see why they have a Michelin Star!",

It was outside, which was fine as it was a cool March evening. I saw many people being turned away after I sat down. \u00a0 \u00a0I ordered the miso eggplant, the romaine salad, the steak, and a mint ice cream for dessert. This was a bit too much food for one, I realized late, but it was fabulous! I specifically asked the waiter for the smallest cut of steak and he recommended it be done medium rare, which I don't usually do, but it was so, so, so good. The steak comes with a small salad, so the romaine salad was really unnecessary - it would have been helpful if the waiter had told me. The romaine was the least successful of the items, it was strangely salty.  \u00a0 Make the time for this place when you're in Singapore!",

I got lucky when I showed up for my 6pm reservation and was told a seat at the front counter watching the kitchen wasn't needed until 8pm. Score! It was fabulous watching the staff work like a well-oiled machine. I started with a delicious whisky drink and then had the smoked quail egg with caviar. The smokiness was lovely. Then I had the meat marmalade (minus the aioli as I'm not a fan of aioli-yummy!), pork belly with apple and raspberry pur\u00e9e (yum!), and the leeks (OMG good!). It was all outstanding! And let me tell you...get the leeks. They were buttery and had hazelnuts and were chargrilled. I still remember what they taste like. Just go and eat some for me.",

    "text": "My favourite restaurant in Singapore. Burnt Ends gets it all right. The meat and seafood will blow your socks off. Dishes that at first appear super simple are, after diving in, deeply complex. This started with snow crab leg in herb butter, roasted leek, eggplant and then moved on to the ' Burnt Ends Sanger' (amazing!) & rump cap. Sounds like a lot for two, but the dishes are small and perfect to share. We finished with the sugar cake and smoked ice cream. The cocktails and wines are phenomenal, but it's the experience and theatre going on in the kitchen as you sit at the bar that seals the deal. Go here. Yeah it's not cheap, but it shouldn't be.",

I never had a bad dish here on any of my visits and they are combining that with an interesting beer and wine selection as well as nicely crafted cocktails and to add to that the prices are, while not cheap, very reasonable. So with this in mind and the fact that they are highly acclaimed as well it should actually be five stars and they could so easily be given that from me.The failing is however the service. Part of the service is fine and that would be the chefs behind the counter. They make the food and manage to be friendly and do a bit of talking to customers as well. The waiters and waitresses have however on every occasion been bad. First visit I asked the girl serving us how many dishes she would recommend for the two of us - response was 'how should I know howMuch you want to eat'. Great attitude. She was then mostly spending the evening doing very kittle and having another girl run around like crazy. Long waits to order, difficulty to pay have however been constant issues here but the food is so good that I keep coming back.",

Amazing flavor and aroma. Served simply in a whiskey glass with a nice big round ice ball. My date ordered the Happy Ending....which got a good laugh from the people next to me since I had to ask the female server for a Happy Ending....but yea all in good fun ahahaIt appears that they must have a rotating menu, (judging from the fact that there was a date on the menu hehe)Tonight we tried the Uni toast...if it's there just try it. Apparently I was the first to order as it was brand new and it certainly did not disappoint. Uni spread on a wheat toast with some toasted seaweed....oh man why can't butter be this good!Of course we had to try some steak! The server shows us the meat before the even grill it, which was a nice touch! We also had a squid pico de gallo and a pulled pork sand which.  Definitely a great date place. I will be coming back!",
