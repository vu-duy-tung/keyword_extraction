JPot is a place where y'all find common ground.Each person has their own individual pot so load and order whatever you please! Since this place is part of the Jumbo group, I def. recommend trying the seafood items as they're quite fresh. The kurobota pork is also the best meat item--far better than the marinated beef or chicken. Best broth? JPot Superior by far. Laksa is nice, but it a bit bland for my liking. Service is also quite prompt as they are trained in the Jumbo-ways: a basket and bag for your bag, wet napkins but no dry napkins, and limited rudeness...Me likie! Reservations can be made on Chope but I suggest calling in as the timing on Chope isn't favorable. Enjoy!",

Order was taken on the ipad at the table. Note that free flow drink is chargeable at S$3.80++/ person.Create your own dip from the 16 sauce bases and condiments available at the counter. There's soya sauce, vinegar, chilli oil, garlic oil, sesame oil, sha cha sauce, sesame sauce, sesame seeds, chopped peanut, shredded leek, chopped spring onion, chopped coriander leaves, chopped deep fried garlic, chopped garlic, chopped chilli padi, and garlic chilli sauce.Fish Head Soup \u9c9c\u9c7c\u5934\u6c64 (S$7.80++)The soup was milk and rich, and came with 2 big pieces of fried fish. Wish that it did not served with deep fried fish. The soup was refillable.Hand-made Fish Noodle \u624b\u5236\u9c7c\u9762\u6761 (S$5.80++)Served in a plastic bag, one just squeezed the filling out and it would form noodle like shapes. The noodle was quite tender and smooth.Marinated Pork \u6ed1\u732a\u7247 (S$4.80++)The staff told me that the pork was served with a raw quail egg as it would make the meat more tender. Indeed. Although the meat was slightly fatter than preferred, the texture was very smooth.Fried Beancurd Skin \u70b8\u8150\u76ae (S$6.80++)Served in a basket, these crispy rolls just a quick dip the hot soup to soak up the flavours.Japanese Tang-O \u66f0\u672c\u833c\u84bf (S$5.80++)Similar to the beancurd skin, the vegetable cooked rather easily. It would turn black if left too long in the pot.",

For a difference of a few bucks, another set option gave seafood and fresh shabu shabu-style of meat slices instead of marinated chunks of meat. There is a wide variety of ingredients for you to create your own sauce for dipping. Those who chose a cold beverage to go with the food was spoiled for choice on the usual soft drinks and others like barley. I tried the superior soup which was addictive and tasted my friend's herbal soup which was surprisingly light and yet good in taste. I'm trying that soup the next time!",

Our jumbo card gets us 10% off the bill so I can order an extra portion of their fried fish skin - yums. The meats are very good quality for the price though I can't say the same for $4 golden mushrooms. Our fave soup bases are the Salted Vege Duck soup (semi-clear) and Fish Head soup (creamy). Be prepared to wait 1 hour without reservations unless you can make it for a 6pm walk-in when they open.",

Search under \"All\" to locate. \u00a0A good variety of soups and a personal hot pot is a plus. \u00a0Soup is very flavorful! The single sauce bowl is a downer as well as a lack of napkins which seem like a norm here. \u00a0Ordering from the iPad is a bit not as straight forward as you have to dig around submenus to find what you want to order. Portions of meats and veggies are a good size. Self serve drink selection is good. Would eat here again!",

    "text": "I think the Taiwanese would call this a shua shua guo place, mainly because you get individual soup pots so you can decide which broth you want. My personal favorite is always the superior broth, or sometimes tom yum... but the bak kut teh broth is worth a try too. This bak kut teh broth recipe comes from the famed Ng Ah Sio BKT restaurant in Rangoon Road ;) You can mix your own sauces at the bar, and they even provide some simple \"recipes\" for you to mix some of their special sauces. Of course, you're free to come up with your own concoction, but you'll have no one to blame but yourself for the tummy ache later :P  The food served is usually pretty fresh, so feel free to take your pick between the vast seafood and meat selection. Or you could just go for their sets if you're lazy to decide.Overall pleasant experience (it is run by Jumbo afterall)... but if I had $50, I think I'd go for Haidilao.",

    "text": "There is only 1 way to have steamboat and that is in the comfort of an air-conditioned restaurant, with fresh seafood and quality meat, attentive servers and ala carte style. The Marina steamboat days are long behind us. Please do not ask me out for steamboat buffet at Bugis or anything similar to that thanks. I'm not being atas, it's just that comfort is more my style.JPot is my top favorite place for steamboat in Singapore. Opened by the Jumbo group, they do really fresh seafood. Oh you live fresh prawns. I'm so glad they kinda killed the prawns before serving to us. Imperial Treasures served us jumping prawns on skewers. So torturous to watch them and then kill them ourselves. Really sweet and crunchy fresh prawns. Great scallops. Everything was just so perfect. Must order items are the marinated pork, beef short ribs, fried beancurd skin (this is awesome), scallops and prawns among other little items. The Jumbo Pork Ball isn't too bad as well. It was freshly made and mixed with herbs like chinese parsley (yucks) but somehow it tasted pretty good after boiling in the broth. You can make many little pork balls from the mother of all pork balls.Choose from a variety of broth- Tom Yum, Superior (my fav), Vegetarian, Bak Kut Teh, Porridge and more. You can have indiv small pots or big ones for sharing. :)It's not cheap for sure but you don't have to order a lot to be satisfied.",

I was away from SG for that period, and immediately noticed that the jumbo pork ball was not so jumbo anymore, and the portion sizes have shrunk significantly. Not sure about the other outlets, but the one at Vivo does a roaring trade, including tour groups from Japan etc so I guess they don't really feel the need to excel. They have also moved towards more DIY, i.e. ordering via iPad and pouring your own cold water, which is fine by me. But the food's becoming a letdown.",

Unlike most communal steamboats, you have the option of having your own personal hotpot, so there's no arguing over which soup base the majority prefers! There are 7 soup bases to choose from - I'm particularly fond of the bak ku teh base, though the superior broth (it's just chicken soup folks) is not bad too. Sauce fans also have a whole range of condiments to choose from in a separate table. The food also is quite decent, ranging from hotpot staples to dim sum even. Depending where you sit, you might be able to get a nice view of the Harbourfront Bay area too.It gets really, really crowded - make a reservation for weekends.",

Let's be honest here, you'd get more food for less at Coca steamboat because it's buffet, and the quality of ingredients is alllllmost (but not quite) as good.The biggest win for me? Individual soup pots. I don't want the tomyum soup that my mother wants. She doesn't want the herbal base that I want. My brother? He's so inconsistent sometimes I wonder if he has secret a \"soup base\" die that he rolls every time we go.Personally? I like the superior broth and the herbal soup. Both are flavourful without being overpowering (tomyum I'm looking at you), while I find the bak ku teh base not peppery enough.I love having the sauce bar to mix and match the flavours you want, and I don't think I've ever been let down by the service. In fact, the last time I was there for lunch, service was actually quite exceptional. Staff were attentive and responsive, and as Jumbo generally seems to do, we were assigned an English speaking staff member because my Mandarin isn't really that spectacular. I've been told that it can be a bit hard to get through on the phone, and reservations are definitely recommended, but I've always just used Chope for my reservations here, and I haven't actually encountered any issues yet. That said, I have walked in before, and while there was a 15 minute wait, I did get a table...",
