It was an hour from the time we ordered the paella until it was delivered. 40 minutes to receive an order of churros. 20 minutes to pay the check that we have to beg to get out of the place. The carne paella was delicious though the chicken was overcooked. The bacon wrapped shrimp was tasty but the rest of the tapas were just mediocre. All in all not worth the aggravation to have a tuna half hour meal. Can't recommend it.",

The main restaurant was in the corner while they had covered outdoor seating right on the river walk. The sangrias were okay. I ordered the calamari, a spicy tuna roll, and the scallops, of which were nothing to write home about. But the wait. There were a few times where we were just waiting. And waiting. And waiting. \"For what?\" you may ask. To take our order, for our food, etc. Which came as a surprise since the place didn't look very busy.Note to self: stick to asian food when in Asia.",

    "text": "All up it was $96 for 3 plates of very average tapas and 2 cocktails. After traditional spanish tapas? This is not the place.At first glance the ambience was nice, however we we're greeted by blank faced staff as we looked for a table. Upon seating ourselves we we're told that the table we sat at was being used by someone else and if we could move to another table...a reasonable request to which we happily obliged. First up was the drinks, having a quick glance at the slightly pricey cocktail menu I opted for a margherita and was asked if I wanted lime, raspberry or something else that sounded a bit candy store..This would usually be a red flag for me but being extremely hot I wasnt in the mood for scanning the menu again so I just went with the lime. It wasn't the worst but certainly not the best, incredibly sweet and tasted like a premix. For tapas we opted for cheese croquetes, a bruschetta style plate & some lamb cutlets. The croquetes themselves we're OK. But they came with a cinnamon style jam which when used together gave the sensation of eating a cheese donut.... Weird. The bruschetta was a doughy, white bread roll cut in half and spread with a tomato, garlic ish paste. In my opinion inedible. I love lamb cutlets, possibly one of my top 10 favourite meals. These we're OK but extremely fatty, I've never seen cutlets with that much fat around the entire cut (close to half an inch).",

    "text": "I was extremely excited to try a Spanish Tapas Bar in Singapore to reminisce on my amazing experience in Barcelona, Spain. Obviously I knew that the experience and food wouldn't be the same or as authentic, and probably a bit overpriced because Octapas is located in the tourist central of Clarke Quay. First off, we made a reservation for a Wednesday night dinner for our friend's birthday. They accidentally gave away our table inside where the live music played (which was not good music anyways) and shifted us outside. At least it was shaded and not too hot outside. We ordered a few tapas and a paella that supposedly fed 4 people. Throughout the course of our dining experience with Octapas, our party progressively became more and more dissatisfied.My extremely small plate of S$12 Champinones al Ajilo (Mushrooms with Garlic) was drenched in oil and salt. I had to chug my entire cup of water while eating it. And, when I asked for more water - it took forever to get the waiter's attention and we had to ask repeatedly (3 times) to get my refill. And, our bland Valenciana (Meat & Seafood) Paella was $60 and finally came after about 45-50 minutes. This dish is supposed to serve 4 people, but it was extremely small, overcooked, and had an awful cardboard taste. There wasn't much meat (chorizos) or seafood either! \u00a0Also, our $15 Caipirinha cocktails were extremely sweet and barely had any alcohol in it.  Save your time and money by going somewhere else! I would've rather eaten snacks or a Bao at 7-Eleven.",

    "text": "Octapas is a cleverly named tapas bar on the bank of the historical Singapore River, along Clarke Quay. Right next to the Read Bridge (pre-party central), Octapas offers indoor as well as outdoor seating to its patrons. Most nights, live music can be found at this quaint yet vibrant joint, and you can sip an ice cold beverage of your choice as you watch tourist-laden bumboats float by. The menu offers simple Spanish fare, some items more traditional than others, but all of it tasty and satisfying. They also have a happy hour, for those who want to eat out on the cheap - always a bonus in my book! Service can be hit or miss, which is unfortunate, but not uncommon in such touristy areas. Though in my opinion, the food is well worth the occasional frosty waitress. Try the garlic bread, chorizo, meatballs, bacon wrapped prawns, chicken in cream sauce, and croquettes.Buen provecho!",

Also the dish is incredibly small. On top of all of this they charge $5 for a bread basket. And the bread is incredibly subpar, and the butter is cheap and of very poor quality.Also the food took an incredibly long time to come and when my friends (who ordered the Paella) got their food, it looked like it sat in a fridge for a couple days before they microwaved it and put it on our table. I don't understand how it could have taken 45 minutes to microwave a dish.Anyways me and my party didn't even eat our food after trying it. We refused to eat it and told the waiter that we refused to pay for their pathetic excuse for food. It certainly doesn't help that their service was just horrendous. So incredibly slow.Also our reservation was not honored and only after standing our ground with the staff did we get a table outside.",

We ordered Paella to share and we were told that we have to wait for 30 mins so the waitress recommended that we order tapas as well. As we are already starving, we ordered beef and calamares. Lo and behold, paella came like 10 mins later. While we were eating, the waitress came over and told us that they need to send back the paella as this was for the other table (good for 4) and not for 2.Ok, so they take back the paella to the kitchen to do what again? Add more and serve to another table? And then she came back and said its okay like we owe her. I wanted to call the manager and talk to them about this unacceptable quality of service but was there to catch up and spend quality time with a friend so I didn't bother anymore.We ended up paying $120 for a mediocre food and utterly lousy service.Really not worth it!",

This is a nice place for a traveling group, since the tapas format allows for the sharing of several small dishes. We shared the chorizo, garlic shrimp, garlic bread, vegetable bruschetta, and paella. The vegetable bruschetta and chorizo were the best dishes. The paella was mediocre and needed a lot more spice. The portion sizes were appropriate. They also served good mixed drinks, such as a mojito. There was also a live band setting up, which began playing towards the end of the meal. Thankfully, it consisted of a pleasant soft female singer rather than the rowdy ear-destroying over-amped guitar music that typical bar bands chuck at diners.",

We ordered our drinks from yet another cheery waitress as noticed on my previous visit. When the waitress came back I placed out food order for the Paella as I knew it would take a bit longer to cook. We were into our second cocktail when the kitchen brought out the pan of Paella and took the foil covering off at the table. I can't describe well enough how excellent the dish was enjoyed by the both of us as this was a most delicious meal. I was so glad that my decision to return to this establisment as a treat to my coworker. Our culinary experience was only topped such an attentive staff as well as Manager that personally asked how our meal was being enjoyed.Once again I not only recommend Octapas, but state that I will be back for at least one more dinner here before my business trip concludes. Kudos to the hard working staff that consistently makes this place a favorite of mine in Singapore!",
