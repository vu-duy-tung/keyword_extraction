    "text": "Easily one of my favorite cat cafes worldwide - not because of the location itself, but because of the people.Meomi is a rather tiny cat cafe in Singapore. \u00a0There's something quaint to it, really - it's one rather small room populated by a handful of cats with big personalities, making it a sort of cute refuge in a big city.What makes Meomi so great isn't necessarily the cats, though - it's the people. \u00a0The staff at Meomi are friendly, fun, and definitely love showing off their cats. \u00a0Better yet, they make a concerted effort to make sure everyone (small children, scared patrons, etc.) experience and have fun with the cats in a meaningful way. \u00a0That's above and beyond anything I've ever seen at a cat cafe and, frankly, really darn cool.If you're in the area, please go here! \u00a0They definitely deserve your support.",

    "text": "Cute cat cafe in Singapore! The staff is extremely friendly and the decor is nice. An hour stay cones with a complimentary drink and there are also stocked and toys you can by to support the cats. My main complaint is that if you actually want to play with cats, this probably is not the place for you. You are not allowed to pick up the cats and they are also very shy, running away whenever I tried to pet them.However, the overall vibe of the cafe is extremely nice and cute. Plus we came during dinner time and got to see the cats line up and eat!",

My colleague and I visited on a Sunday afternoon, and surprisingly we were able to walk in without a reservation. Unlike Neko No Niwa in Boat Quay, with a lot of rules to remember, there was only one simple rule to follow here, and that is to not pick up any of the cats.I counted 7 cats in the room, and luckily most of them were awake and active. There were 2 of them who slept on the high ledges where no one could reach them, so we missed out on photographing and playing with them.The cats looked happy, healthy, comfortable around people, and responded well to balls and being pet. Waving the feather toys at them didn't really seem to amuse them so much!I loved how they had a TV that looped a clip of birds congregating and eating birdseed- how thoughtful to provide them cat TV programming! They offer free wifi and some drinks, snacks, and cakes. I would still recommend a reservation to ensure you have a spot with these lovely kitties. Enjoy your cat therapy!",

    "text": "It's actually my first time to a cat cafe, and it's ended up a pleasant experience for sure. Pets cafes in KL are definitely on the rise now, but I have yet to hear about a good one. The usual feedback I get after any of my friends visit a pets cafe would be that it still smell in the cafe, which is exactly something that didn't bother me at all while I'm visiting Meomi cat cafe in Singapore - no smell at all!Cats to me, I always feel like they are judging me when they are looking at me - 'you human, ugh' I myself have a dog at home, and that's definitely different too. Staff here were very friendly when we were there, and we were lucky to have visited the cafe at a not so busy hours that we could get in straight away without any wait. Again, thanks so much to Michelle M. for bringing me to the cafe and exploring Singapore! Felt so loved!While you're there, you'd be given a few choices of 'ala carte' or package. Basically, they charge by per hour - so if you're planning to stay more than an hour, you'd have to pay for the subsequent half hour prices. But, they did mention that they will be giving a 5-minute-grace-period. They have very few rules here in fact, and we were only told not to carry the cats or take photos with flash. Of course, petting them is still allowed. But, do pay close attention to them when they are telling you which cats they have there is friendlier, and which are less ;) I managed to see 7 of them during my visit, you gotta look all over the places to spot all of them!",

It's becoming quite a routine!Happy that I stumbled upon Meomi Cat Cafe while wandering around Haji Lane! It's a small space and has 7 beautiful cats for you to observe or play with.I'm not very impressed by the price of their drinks though. 13SGD to enter and see the cats and your complimentary drink is apple juice from a box bought in a store? That's a bit disappointing and expensive! However, everything else is great! The staff members are very enthusiastic cat people and they loved to tell you more about their feline friends; how Coo has a munchkin admirer, how Lunar is a rescue cat. It's nice to see passionate caretakers! Then you know the cats are well taken care of.I'd only recommend cat cafes to animal lovers/cat people because it's just a nice place to simmer down and distress. Especially if the cats like you enough to show some love.",

    "text": "I'm terrified of animals. But I knew my husband would LOVE going to a cat caf\u00e9 (as he'd hinted more than just once).So for his Christmas special, I faced my fear - all 7 of them.And their names were Junior, Coo, Curley, Frowny, Luna, Mario and Oreo - pretty cute names for the fierce monsters I imagine them to be.I think the small space of the caf\u00e9 was an advantage. With less room for the cats to wander, there's a higher chance you get to see, touch and play with them. The maximum capacity is about 12 to 14 people, so with 1 cat to 2 humans, there's a pretty good bet you'll be having quality time with the furballs!And for the fearful (like me), it's easy to stay in the corner and see where all the cats are so that there won't be any surprises.When we were there from about 4.30 to 5.30pm, a few cats were snoozing. Unfortunately, 2 of them never made it down from their resting places high above ground. Good for me, not so good for the cat fanatics!The rest of the cats were either playing around with the cat toys held by customers, or snoozing away in view of everyone. I plucked up my courage and managed to pet two of the sleepy cats! And we even had a 'show' of the owner cutting the nails of one of the cats, who promptly fell asleep midway.Cats can be so lazy.Click here for the full review:wp.me/p6xSip-Kt",

Service: The girl who worked there was really nice and shared a lot about the cats at the cafe. She introduced each cat to us and told us about their personalities. A+Cats (the real show): We were able to interact with 4 cats today the rest of them were taking naps. The munchkin Mario was literally the cat version of a corgi. Very adorable. The curly ear cat Curlie was also insanely cuddly and cute. Overall, I would come here everyday if I could. The cats are so chill and the people who work here really do love their jobs and the cats. I truly enjoyed the cafe a lot!",
