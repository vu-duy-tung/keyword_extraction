Takeaway is pretty good value for money, as they give a slight discount and don't charge for service. Can't really speak for the service there as I usually get it takeaway. Nice looking interior, looks like a good spot for a date.",

    "text": "A few key points that I noted. The service of this restaurant is the downfall of the visit. The meats are either undercooked or overcooked. When we made a feedback, the Chinese staff didn't acknowledge. He just went to the next Indian junior staff, asked who took the order to pass the baton, and then just conveniently went about his way. The junior staff was just dumbfounded and didn't follow up. And then swept under the carpet. We were celebrating 2 birthdays. Asked for 1 candle to be placed each, on 2 desserts but instead still came 1 candle on 1 dessert. I had a baby, and there was no baby chair until I had to ask for one. \u00a0There were no plastic cutleries offered.",

Good wine selection as well.They also have a brocolli and meat pasta cooked in white wine which is refreshingly light and very tasty. I must say that brocolli never tasted this good with pasta.Overall a nice place with good service and away from the chaos of a mall or the city.",

    "text": "Overall pleasant dining experience, great ambiance for a date night. Their dessert (the Mascarpone cheesecake) triumphs all! 1. Mascarpone cheesecake - Must try!2. Veal tripe (organs) - Pass unless you enjoy kway chap. Cooked in a rich, creamy tomato sauce. Overall good but I am not a fan of animal organs. 3. Saute clams - Very fresh :) 4. Pasta lobster ($68) - A very generous portion. I'd recommend sharing it. 5. Pasta crab meat - Good. Best main! 6. Spagetti cartoccio - Too much olive oil. Pasta was a bit overcooked. 7. Wine - Palazzo della torre ($98) 8. Frittura - translation: fried food (squid, prawns), served with baked potatoes and some cut vegetables. - I enjoyed the baked potatoes but the fried food was just ok. I usually enjoy my calamari but this time not so much.Mains were about $20+ except the lobster. Desserts were on the house (usually $9 each), in celebration of CNY :) We returned the kind gesture by giving the owner and his staff a hong bao each.",

Bookings are a must, with crowds swarming over the place and almost everyone makes a reservation. So if you don't, expect a long wait before you can try the delicious food on offer -- homemade cheese ravioli with porcini mushrooms, and diavola pizza with salami.",

They have an extensive variety of pastas and pizzas, although if your party is exclusively thinking of pizzas, it may be a better option to hop over to Pepperoni's because the ones here are decent, but not quite as good. The pastas, however, are quite pleasing, and I've enjoyed both the squid ink and crabmeat ones. My absolute favourite part of an evening out at La Braceria, however, has to be dessert - their mascarpone cheesecake is to die for, and it's truly a joy to eat. Definitely a must-try!",
