    "text": "Neo: I used to eat there; really good noodles.Knock, knock Neo...Wanton Seng's is *that* noodle place of your plugged-in dreams. If you have an affinity for ramen-style flavours and textures then Wantons should be right in your sweet spot.Located at the tail-end of Amoy St, this noodle house stands out by the sea of diners on its doorstep; and its iconic white on black retractable awning.For the hungry lunch-timer I'd recommend getting in early before it fills up and taking a space on the long bar bench in order to take in the interesting view of the kitchen activity.Dish of choice is the Combo - char siew & roasted pork belly, wontons, spring onions, fried shallots, 5 minute egg, & gangster baby kailan (scallops, braised shiitake, fried garlic). This comes with a bottom-less Miso Soup which you can self-serve top-up via the stainless steel soup pourer located in a station nearby to your seat (which also contains all your cutlery and napkin needs).I always leave here with a ramen-esque satisfied smile on my dial post noodle-athon.",

    "text": "What?! No lard? They ran out of it the day before and did not make a new batch. Such disappointment. I had the Twosome - aburi char siew and sio bak with wantons. I think I will skip the meat next time as they are too thick and hard for my liking. What do I like about this atas wanton mee? The noodle, wantons and the soup! The noodle was springy, wantons were tasty with silky thin skin and the soup transported me to the days where wanton mee sellers in hawker centers or coffee shops take pride in their skills to make a darn good bowl of noodle. The soup has flavor, none of those salted water with a bare hint of taste. The lunch menu has changed and expanded. Now there is a mushroom and wanton noodle. I will want to try that next time. And I will add extra wantons to my noodle too. It is that good. The staff were friendly and knowing it was my first visit, they asked for feedback and explained what the various sauces were for. I mentioned the meat was a bit hard but otherwise the meal was yummy. They charge GST and a bottled water cost $2. They do not serve water here. Oh and do get in before 12pm otherwise you will find yourself waiting outside for a table. It gets crowded real quick after 12pm.",

    "text": "Pretty good \"high-end\" wan ton noodles here at Seng's Noodle Bar located along Amoy Street. As the name suggest, the star at this small eatery is none other than the humble wan ton noodles, where a decent plate will cost you at most $3 in any hawker center in Singapore. Here, they elevate the dish to another level - using good quality noodles, amazingly good bbq pork belly and other add-ons like 5 min-egg, roast pork, kailan (vege) and so forth. At first I thought this concept is lame and gimmicky but after 2 visits, I think Ah Seng did a good job and deserves a shoutout here on Yelp. A standard bowl of char siew wan ton noodles or roasted pork belly wan ton noodles will cost you $6.50, and if you're greedy like me, then get the \"two-some\" where you get the best of both accompaniment to your noodles ($7.50). Don't just stop here, add on the 5-min egg ($2) and extra fried wan tons (3 for $2) and you get a bowl of heaven at the price of $11. While the price might be expensive for a bowl of wan ton noodles, the portion's generous and guarantees a satisfactory lunch / dinner. Soup and other condiments (eg green chili, PORK LARD - OMFG!), and sauces are free flow, so just customize your own to your liking. I like my noodles black as squid ink, so ill usually drench thick soya sauce on my noodles before I stir everything and gobble it down. Service is prompt and friendly. Come early or slightly later after the peak lunch hour (12-1pm) to avoid having to queue to get in. Highly recommended if you're nearby this area.",

There was also cocktails available on the drink menu.ThreeSome \u00a0- ThreeSome ThreeSome ($8.50)char Siew, roasted pork, wontons, braised shiitake mushrooms, spring onions, fried shallotsThe roast pork was light and crispy in texture. The Char Siew which looked like braised pork belly, was a bit dry. The mushroom was fat and juicy but tasted a bit too much of vinegar. I like that there was crispy pork lards in it. The wantons were average.Cosmoy ($16)infused Pandan vodka, cranberry juiceReminded me of an adult version of ribena.Don't forget to add condiments such as crispy pork lard and Seng's infamous chilli sauce to the noodles.

I really enjoyed the batalong eggs, which is a local twist on a scotch egg; really yum!Everything else was okay, I'd come back again if I was in the area and didn't know what to eat. I have to say I am slightly swayed by the hipster vibe, and I love that I can customize the amount of hot sauce and pork lard bits in my noodles, but it's not amazing for me to crave it and come here specially.",
