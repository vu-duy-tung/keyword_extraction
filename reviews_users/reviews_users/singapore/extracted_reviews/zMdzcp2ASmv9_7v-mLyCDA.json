Do check out their Fb page for opening days as certain days may be booked for events or so.Overall the location of the place is excellent at Bugis+ and they have a smoking area outside as well.Typically you get tapas bites and 1 for 1 offers, great for big groups and intimate gathering for beers! Had their luncheon meat fries and they were fried beautifully with a serving of nancho cheese chips.They have dart machines in the bar as well so dart fanatics, dart your night away.For fellow Yelpers and Yelp Elites, do write a review and get a free luncheon meat fries on ur next visit. Do check with the staff on this promotion!",

    "text": "If you're planning to organize your company event here, this place is a one star only.Food - good and sufficient for the flowService - actually a 1 star service. Food was served very late, 12.50pm when my company event supposed to start at 12pm!! Totally unacceptable! The owner appeared really \"chin chai\" (anyhow attitude), and agrees to everything prior to the event, but failed to deliver.Location - your PowerPoint slides can flash on to their big wall in stage, yes, but in fact it's day time and there will be light entering the entire bar which makes your visibility of details on screen really low. Although there are TV screens available, but they are not compatible to the laptop and is unable to screen your PowerPoint slides. Here comes the issue. The owner actually mentioned that you can flash your PowerPoint slides prior to your event. That's cheating!Price - expensive and not value for money.Overall experience was bad for a corporate event.No doubt, it's an ok location to hang out with your friends. But if you cannot handle a corporate event, please stop advertising for it, or find someone who is capable of doing it professionally. I can only say, the boss is just a pub owner, not a professional event organizer trained.",

    "text": "The only reason this place gets 1 star and not 0 is that the live band was fabulous.This place handed us an iPad (as many places in Singapore do) and we selected our drinks. My SO selected a pint for $14 and I selected a vodka Smirnoff for $11. A submenu popped up asking me to specialse this drink. \u00a0I was surprised when I selected double vodka and apple juice that it remained at $11. Suspicious, I took a photo of our receipt at the end of our transaction. $31. My SO handed a credit card over to pay the bill and we were charged $44!! They had sneakily charged me for the double vodka and apple juice. I suspected this, however I would not have ordered them had I known that there was a charge for this. $11 was fine for me. \u00a0They kept this completely secret and upon dispute, even though I kept a picture of the receipt, my SO was charged for this. I will be showing this to our hotel - the intercontinental - to have it rectified and this place will be mortified over it's appalling customer service.",

Also, when you come on a regular night, they play cool local music. Even though I was a bit skeptical when I came here for the first time and needed to go through the entire Bugis+ shopping mall in order to come here, I was very nicely surprised when I reached and since that time Hood Bar has become one of my favorite spots for meetings with friends.",

    "text": "This is the place to go if you are looking to listen to original music in Singapore. Almost all the bars and clubs in the country play cover songs but Hood is one place that's looking to break that mould. And more power to them I say! What kind of a country has so much talent but has so little platforms for it's musicians?Opened by musicians for musicians and music lovers, this place has just moved over from their old location at Keong Saik road. The ambience is friendly and casual. The bands that play here differ in terms of music styles and even languages. I've heard full out canto bands, hard rock bands, metal bands, easy listening and singer songwriter stuff here too. Original music is played on Saturdays so that would be my day to visit. I might go down with ear plugs. It might get loud.Outdoor smoking area available andyou can bring your brews out too. great for an indoor drinking hole.",

They used to be located in a cosy spot in keong saik street. A relocation with a bigger fit out, bigger bar and now a food menu, the Hood I've always loved just got better. Drink prices are reasonable, the live bands great, food wise the hot dogs are the biggest and tastiest in Singapore for sure.They have been really clever with their choice of location. It was fantastic to pop in for a drink and a hot dog, before going to the cinema on the same floor before returning for more drinks and a chilled out Saturday evening. Cool tunes, great food and great live music, highly recommend a visit to Hood. It has just got a whole lot bigger and better!!",
