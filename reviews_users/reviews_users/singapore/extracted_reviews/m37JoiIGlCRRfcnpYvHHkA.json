We split the lunch set (10 pax).The crispy rice chips were perfectly crisp and paired well with the prawn and chicken. The Tom Yum Soup was very refreshing and mildly spicy. The Chicken Wings and Scallops were also excellent.The Green Curry was nothing special and the Pomfret was too heavily fried - but the desserts (the Tapioca especially) rounded off an excellent meal with great service.",

The prices are reflective of the atmosphere, but it's absolutely worth it for a delicious thai meal. I will go back again and again - especially for the tom yum soup. Only negative was they do not have a liquor license right now, but you can bring your own and pay a corkage fee.Food:Tom Yum soup - incredible, must order. Note, it is a bit spicyGreen Curry - Very goodDuck curry - very goodSpring rolls - good, but not blown awaypad thai - very goodPineapple rice - very good",

The red curry with chicken was just ok, thin and vegetables were undercooked. Portions are small and not worth the price tag. Go to golden mile, you can get a curry twice as good for half the price",

    "text": "Gluten free! Yep, a Thai restaurant in Purvis St and it is safe to eat in :-)I love Singapore - this is my 3rd visit in a year for work but being gluten free has been hard. In Asia and I want Asian food but every time I show my diet card, I'm told 'nothing for you here'. We found Shingthai near the top of Purvis St and I was glad we did. The menu says to check with staff over dietary requirements so I did, gave my order and was told that was ok. I had the spicy beef salad and the pineapple rice with pork and prawns. Both were stellar dishes. Lovely medium cooked slices of beef and they didn't stint on the beef either. The pineapple rice was fab too - beautifully flavoured with a great balance of sweet and savoury.I'll be honest and admit I didn't pay much attention to the decor and didn't use the toilets. Food came fairly quickly so once that was on the table, we all munched away. The meals come when ready so not starter then main style but that was fine for us.We were $40 sing for starter and main and a drink. Portions are pretty large per person and many dishes can be made to share too. Well worth a visit and as a gluten free person, a fab meal that was safe for me :-)",

    "text": "Absolutely fantastic food and service.In Australia we're treated to a grand choice of Thai cuisine, but this is hands down the best Thai I've eaten, including when I've been to various places in Thailand. Whilst the stuffed chicken wings seem to be the house's speciality, it was the red duck curry, fresh papaya salad, strip-steak salad that were my personal favourites. The strip-steak salad actually comprises excellently grilled steak, rather than the dry, chewy, beef you're often treated to in many Asian cuisines.The staff were very busy, as the restaurant is quite popular on a Saturday, but still managed to provide prompt service with a smile.The one thing I will warn of though, and this is by no means a negative, is that when a dish is typically served with chilli in Thailand, expect it to be close to as hot as the Thais like it.For my wife, this was a step too hot, but for me, I loved it.In Australia we're used to \"white person\" hot where the dishes have a mild kick and it was a (somewhat welcome) surprise to have some face-melting chilli in the mix. If you're sensitive to heat, ask them to tone it down a notch. I also assume this is why locals order more modest (aka bland) dishes and we were the only ones with interesting looking food on our plates.One last little trinket if you've made it this far: avoid the glutinous rice and durian. It's served like porridge and unless you really REALLY like durian (and that sort of rice + custard + fruit style) avoid it and order something else. It's not often I'm smiling at the end of a meal. I think this may be my favourite Singaporean meal, if not one of my favourites ever.",

    "text": "We came here with some regulars for dinner to celebrate a belated Father's Day. The restaurant had a very good ambiance and is very nicely decorated with many carvings on the wall. It was completely full as well so it was good that we managed a reservation. We started with some thai standards - the fish cake, thai papaya salad, Tom yum kung, pandan chicken and their famous stuffed chicken wings. Having eaten loads of thai food in the past, I have to say that the starters were good. I especially enjoyed the pandan chicken dish and the stuffed chicken wing. They had different dipping sauce with the different starters which allowed us to do a bit of mix and match. The stuffed chicken wing was unique - chicken meat stuffed back into the wing and fried. The pandan chicken was very well done and had a good sauce to accompany. The tom yum was also well done - clear broth with loads of lemongrass and packs a nice punch. We followed with a fried grouper, roast duck red curry and stif \u00a0fried Kang Kung. All very well done - the fried grouper came with a sweet spicy accent and the roast duck red curry was yummy & mildly spicy. All goes well with a bowl of rice. We ended with the tup tim krob and the mun chium. We love the tup tim krob but have been frequently disappointed - it was surprisingly good here. Itis a coconut broth filled with the 'red rubies' (pieces of chestnut soaked in some syrup n covered with a layer of red colouring) and slices of jackfruit & coconut. A lovely ending to a good night - Pricing is steep but we all had a good time.",

We also always order the stuffed chicken wings, always a crowd pleaser.The deep fried pomfret is also great. It doesn't come as a whole fish though, it is cut into a few big pieces.The olive rice is easily the best you can find in town. You have to like olive though because their version here comes with a very generous portion of olives all fried within. Tossed it with some tiny lime pieces and chilli, it is brilliant and totally hits the spot.End it with mango sticky rice and tapioca!",

The stuffed chicken wings, mango salad and the mango sticky rice were exceptional. The green curry average. The betel leaf salad, winged bean salad and red ruby dessert were pathetic. So a bit all over the place, and disappointing at some level. The ambience is nice, and a pleasant alternative to the otherwise super-basic crammed low-end or gaudy, gilded and cushioned high end that makes up most of the Thai alternatives in the city. A relaxed, spacious and modern appointment in a space that still feels like the shophouse it is. If these guys could start feeling a little less cool, and focus on their customers and their food this could be a really nice place to go.",

The ambience is nice and cosy with cushiony walls and Thai d\u00e9cor. To complete any Thai meal, there has to be Tom Yum Soup. The rendition of the Tom Yum Soup here is clear and tangy as compared to the red and creamy one that is served at other restaurants. The clear broth is very palatable but a tad too spicy. The fresh and succulent prawns in the soup make up for it though. I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice too, which was delightfully fragrant and flavorsome. The pineapple, egg and prawns in the rice all contributed to the aroma, while the pork floss on top completed the dish. All in all, a pleasant experience and I would patronize this restaurant again to satisfy any Thai food cravings.",

    "text": "Delicious thai food! Bf's foodie friend recommended it, so how can it go wrong.. Haha. I'm not sure about pricing though, didn't see too much of the menu. Might be a little on the higher side, I'm guessing. Pretty nice ambiance, nice cushy red decor on the walls, servers dressed in bright red/pink colours.We had:1. Iced lemongrass pandan drink ($3.50) - nice and refreshing!2. Tom yum clear soup ($7 per bowl, I believe) - our friend said to order it clear if we didn't want too much spice, else it'd come with quite some amt of chilli oil and could be pretty spicy!3. Pomelo salad - mm! yum. Interesting that there was a bit of char-grilled something in it. 4. Khao Tang Nah Tang - rice cracker with minced chicken coconut curry type dip - delicious! Rice cracker on its own tasted like one of those Want Want rice crackers, so that alone was pretty good. But when you spoon the dip on.. Mm! Comfort food!!5. Signature fried fish - indeed, as our foodie friend described, dry fried outside but still moist and flaky inside, with delicious mango sauce to go along!6. Green chicken curry - mm! my favourite. tender chicken, 7. Red beef curry - pretty good too, actually. Good textured beef, bamboo shoots, mm![both curries had these tiny ball-like pea eggplants in them, very cute! slightly bitter. also these larger rounder Thai eggplants which somewhat resemble tomatos on the inside]8. Thai fish cake - came with delicious plum sauce!9. Pandan chicken - very juicy and well grilled! Also came with dark soy sesame sauce of some sort10. Olive rice - SO GOOD. I hadn't had olive rice before, but this has converted me. I normally shun olives. There was some sort of waxed chicken or something that came with it, pretty interesting.. somewhat sweet.11. Seafood fried rice - can definitely taste the oil, but sinfully yummy. Quite a bit of seafood too! crab, prawn, squid, etc12. Stuffed chicken wing - our foodie friend said these are the BEST stuffed chicken wings he's ever had, and I have to agree. Bursting with flavour (again, very juicy chicken, mushroom, asparagus - which stuffed chicken wing has asparagus?!) and well fried!13. Mixed veges - normal oyster sauce veg, yay for lotus root. Quite a mix of veg but nothing spectacular, just standard veges. cauliflower; broccoli; asparagus; carrots; snow peas...I stole some of my bf's durian glutinous rice - it was somewhat surprising though, came in kind of a porridge type sauce. Not really what I expected - I thought the normal was durian on the side and glutinous rice, the way mango and sticky rice is served. Foodie friend's staple is red ruby, which I would've loved to try, but could not stuff another morsel down!",
