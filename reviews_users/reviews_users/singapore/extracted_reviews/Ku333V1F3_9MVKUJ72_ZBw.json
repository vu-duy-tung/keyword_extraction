I was looking forward to some Lebanese appetisers, salads and grilled meats....after so much rice, noodles and stir fry the last few days. Maybe a bottle of red wine, nothing fancy, to complement it nicely. Upon entering and being seated....Observation #1: There were no middle eastern wait staff on duty.Observation #2: There were no chefs cooking in the brick oven kitchen who looked of Middle Eastern origin either.We ordered Tabouleh, hummus, Baba Ganoush, Kibbeh, a grilled chicken dish and Shish Kebab. With the exception of the chicken dish which had absolutely no hint of cumin, cinnamon, paprika,......nothing !....the other dishes were passable.The highlight was the continuos offer of some pita bread as extras. None were served with the dishes. I enquired how one is supposed to eat grilled meats or hummus without pita bread....'\"You want pita bread mister ?\". Mercy.Then of course there is the mystery red wine poured away from the table and brought to you to drink. Thankfully it was drinkable. I have no idea what I paid for.Don't eat here. It is not worth the time or money. Pick one of the other restaurants further up Bussorah street, towards the mosque, where many diners were seen that night sitting under the warm moonlight having a wonderful meal. Baskets of pita bread on tables in abundance !",

A number of food items we ordered mezze platter and Foul were average, portion size of dishes small and meat kebab platter and Vegetarian Moussaka were quite poor.What is appalling is that we brought poor quality of Moussaka to the attention of our waitress and \u00a0restaurant manager and asked it to be taken back. They gladly took it back with no apologies and didn't even remove the dish from our bill. We are never going back to this place - plenty other places in Arab Street to try.",

We were a little disappointed in the food, specifically the temperature of both entrees, and the quality of the chicken shwarma. My lamb moussaka was delicious, but came out tepid, and the shwarma was also served a little cool, and the accompanying 6 French fries were a bit underwhelming. We greatly enjoyed a post dinner visit to the bar Magic Carpet upstairs, and the belly dancing was a fun touch during the meal. This place was not a must skip, just wasn't a must try.",

The hummus is decent, as is the baba ghanouj (which I have never seen in the Middle East itself, incidentally... I have no idea where this dish is actually from). I also recommend the shish taouk as a main. I've never tried the shisha and the service is typically foreign and understaffed but it's not a bad option if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Yeah, so probably ranks as a really disappointing local food experience (first in Singapore) and what makes it worse was that this place was recommended by a part-time local (she lives 6 months here and 6 months in India). Maybe I should have protested more strongly, but I once took the recommendation of a local to try a Chinese in Cologne (my first thought for that had been, really? Noodles when I can have bratwurst?) but I ended up going there and it was hands down best Modern Chinese \u00a0food that I had eaten in Europe. So it was with similar frame of mind that I approached here but this restaurant frankly failed in my mind to deliver for the most part. And it's not like I am basing this on just one dish. I was in a party of 6 diners and we ate home style so folks shared the food they ordered and we also ordered an entree, so my feeling of disappoint is based on 7 dishes, of which only 2.5 I thought were good, but not good enough for me to go back for a return experience. So my thoughts on the dishes:1) Mezze Platter: hummus needed a more robust taste, but good quality olive oil. Thought it was interesting that there were two kinds of baba ganoush - one with smoked eggplant and one with yogurt. I liked yogurt one more, but majority of folks preferred the smoked one. The cheese was too salty for me in the rolls, but I liked the crispness of the falafel.2) Mixed Grill - mixed experience!! Lamb Kebab sucked - super tough and lacked any spices. Chicken was decent. Lamb chop was burned (c'mon really? why would you even send this out to a diner?)3) Spicy Calamari - urgh! Horrid sticky after taste. The calamari also tasted super slimy - not sure how fresh they were.4) Chicken Shishtiush - liked this one, flavorful and juicy. If ever going back, would get this.5) Vegetarian Moussaka - liked this as well, actually maybe my favorite dish of the night, but that might be because it was drizziling in oil!!I am going to stop here.. just writing about how bad the food was is depressing me. My verdict - AVOID!",

Probably the best middle eastern I have had in singapore. Also the price point was good. I will definitely go back. Thank you to the staff and the chefsGreat job",

I am a regular here, \u00a0for a good reason. \u00a0Their staff is attentive, \u00a0friendly amd tend to you the moment you arrive at their doorstep, \u00a0which is a good sign in my books. \u00a0Having been to Dubai twice, \u00a0there were a few dishes for which the barometer had been set and Beirut Grill came quite close to meeting that level of authenticity. Their labneh (cream cheese yoghurt dip) is legitimately fantastic. Soft, \u00a0creamy and flavourful, \u00a0it comes quite close to what I was served in Dubai. Have it with pita bread or Mexican flat bread, \u00a0it goes well with either. The hummus (chickpea) dip is equally good. Additionally for starters, \u00a0their felafel is a must-try. Not too oily, \u00a0crunchy on the outside and soft inside, \u00a0I was left wanting more. \u00a0Served with sesame paste dip it is a great way to start of any meal at Beirut Grill.Their halumi cheese on the other hand, \u00a0was too salty and that overpowered any other flavour your taste buds would have picked up, \u00a0and seems a tad bit too oily when compared to the other halumi dishes I've tried across Singapore. I am guilty of ordering repeat dishes because I love them so much, \u00a0but do give their mixed grill platter a try. Served with 3 different types of grilled meat, \u00a0the tenderness and flavour of the various entries will satisfy your palate for sure. The shish taouk ( skewered grilled chicken) \u00a0served with lebanese rice is also a worthy option when choosing your mains. The good thing about the restaurant is that they have mastered the art of serving meat that is easy to cut, \u00a0chew and swallow - \u00a0tender and flavourful. They have a fantastic selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks as well. Go for the arabic teas in a variety of flavors. \u00a0I am not a tea-drinker but friends tell me that it's pretty good here. Also who can forget - \u00a0sheesha! It would almost be a crime for a place like this with ample outdoor seating to not serve sheesha. Go for their 'Paan' menthol flavoured sheesha, \u00a0in this humid country its refreshing and cools you down instantly. All in all, \u00a0a great place for dinner, \u00a0lunch even, \u00a0or simply for a hangout session with friends. :)",

So I dragged my parents over to Bussorah Street and parked right outside Beirut Grill and ended up going in.Beirut mezze platter! ($22) Gd selection of hummus, baba ghanoush and moutabal (I think? there were two eggplant dips, one had other veges mixed into it - so it sounds like that was the baba ghanoush and the other was the moutabal), cheese sticks (sambousek) and falafel (nice crisp! but odd in that there was some extra spice in it that I haven't tasted of before).Pita bread was awesome, warm and puffy. Only complaint is that 2 pcs wasn't enough for the entire platter, server offered us another basket, which we accepted (and paid $4 for another two more pieces, oh well....)Beirut Mixed Grill Platter ($29) - chicken was done very well! so were the lamb chops. beef tikka kebab was okay, a bit dry. and lamb kebab kofta was quite a lot gamier in taste than the lamb chops. I'm not a big fan of the gamey taste so that wasn't so good for me. And there was BBQ sauce on the platter, which struck me as somewhat American, I've certainly never seen it on any Middle Eastern place I've been to in the US but that may be just my experience. It added some flavour to the rice/meat though, definitely! Oh, oriental Arabic rice was interesting - cardamom or some spice! Those two platters were pretty filling for my parents and I. Nice ambiance/decor!",

The chicken shawarma was pretty good, the chip / french fries were nice with it too. Friends had the lamb moussaka and spicy sausage and were pretty happy. I wouldn't bother with any kind of alcohol there, watered down.",

I loved their tables - as they had a really nice tablecloth under the glass - and it was really something else. The menu was detailed and done beautifully. The staff were pleasant and friendly. What I Loved: The food was yummmmmy! We ordered the Beirut Spring Chicken ($18) - which came with vegetables and salad. It was very fresh and the chicken was VERY tasty. The meat just fell off the bones and the marinade was just woah. Loved it. It was also enough to share for 2. My date ordered the a Lime Freeze Mock-tail drink - which was crushed with ice - it was very, very, very refreshing. I had a traditional Lebanese coffee - and that was amazing too. When I asked them what time they closed, they were like 1-2am, or even 4am on weekends. Wow! Prices weren't bad too - 1 main, plus 2 drinks, about $30-ish. Pretty okay - considering the ambiance and all.Pretty comprehensive menu. Explore!What I Didn't Love: Absolutely nothing!",
