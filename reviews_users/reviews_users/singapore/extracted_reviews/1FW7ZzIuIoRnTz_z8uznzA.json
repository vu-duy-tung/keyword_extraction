There's complimentary chips given when you sit down. The sauce and spice of the masala is on point and flavourful. It was prepared with white meat which I'm not a fan of so the dish overall is alright.The fish head curry comes in a big pot and the fish head, one head why it's a small serving, is drowning in sauce. I think that's how it's supposed to be. I liked the taste of the curry and the fish was easy to eat. I was able to take out the meat fine. Though I don't think having so much sauce was necessary.Also, protip, you pay at the entrance when you're done and about to leave. As a westerner I asked for the bill but it turns out, you do to the front.",

I devoured all the gloriousness of the fish's cheek and jaw and eyes! Yum! I loved the addition of pineapple in the curry; almost a palette cleanser. I'd say skip everything else and get the fish head curry. Worth it!",

    "text": "Muthu Curry was the place that the Folks insisted on visiting when I said I wanted to have some delicious curry fish head. It's been more than a decade since I last visited Muthu and I had long forgotten the taste. Indeed, the signature South Indian style Curry Fish head ($22/$27/$32) that has secured numerous accolades differed from the Chinese fish head curry in many ways. The colour was intense red instead of yellowish. According to the Folks, this kind of curry uses less coconut milk, so it was less creamy but the gravy is still rich because of the heavy spices rather than curry powder. There were no sight of brinjals, cabbage or tomatoes but ladyfingers and the piquant pineapple slices. Those who are adverse to spicy food will be able to handle this pot easily as the curry is NOT spicy at all. No sweat.We all love the gravy and could ladle it non-stop onto the fragrant Dum Bryani ($4/head) or white rice ($3/head), though the fish was not too fresh that day. If the menu looks Greek to those who seldom have Indian food, there is also display counter where one can pick whatever food that looks tantalizing. The Mysore mutton ($11) was too tough but the Tandoori Chicken (below), chicken marinated in yoghurt, was smoky and flavorful. As a big fan of Indian Vegetarian food, I love all sorts of creamy paneers and Daals. But I decided to ditch the gravy laden veggies and try something new. The Vegetable Sheesh Kebab $9 was a mistake because it turned out to be dry rolls of mixed vegetable potato pattie, though the accompanying green sauce was zingy enough to perk the tastebuds. But the Gobi Manchurian ($9) turned out to be one of my favourite dish that night. Didn't know that it was actually an Indian Chinese fusion dish. Perhaps the Chinese aspect comes from the cooking method--coating the cauliflowers in batter and deep fry just like Sweet and Sour Fish. They are later sauteed in soy and chilli sauce. Not spicy but super sour.Another first try is the Peshwari Naan ($5), a sweet naan in coated with almonds. The Folks commented it was strange to have sweet naan with savoury curry but I thought it was a nice balance to offset all the savoury food. So I rejoiced when I could have the entire naan all myself ( the rest took charge of the remaining rice;)As usual, free flow pappadum, free flow of side vegetables (yellow cabbage was ok but the saut\u00e9ed long beans were too salty). Together with the fragrant non-greasy Bryani rice, it was a great satisfying dinner. Even Ah Ma nods in agreement.",

I have previously visited Samy's in Dempsey on a visit to Singapore last year and it has set a fairly high benchmark. Unfortunately Muthus, which also serves curries on a banana leaf, while decent, is definitely not on par with the likes of Samys.Had a mango lassi to drink which was delicious and I slurped it all up far too quickly. The complimentary bowl of poppadoms at the table was a nice touch but the stale soft ones at the bottom weren't! We tried their famous fish head curry, the almond chicken, a beef vindaloo, saag paneer and the garlic naans. The fish head curry was tasty but prepare to be poking around for some decent chunks of fish. The beef vindaloo was also quite delicious. I found the almond chicken quite boring, with bones in the chicken (I had naively assumed boneless) and the saag paneer very bland and tasteless. \u00a0I had expected rich tastes of spinach and cottage cheese, instead the lukewarm dish lacked any flavour whatsoever. In fact most of their dishes were only warm rather than the steaming hot curries of my imaginations. \u00a0Service was probably in the third quartile, i.e. below average. Quite hard to get their attention when we needed more rice/naan. By which stage our curries were definitely approaching the cold stage. Restaurant is clean and modern, and they do much of their cooking at the kitchen situated in the middle of the restaurant. I wouldn't call it a bad experience, but I wouldn't probably go back either given the host of other options in the city.",

We had fish head curry, the dish was quite disappointing. The fish was hard, over cooked, not fresh and had a hint of an off-putting fishy smell. The fish was placed on a big deep bowl with plenty curry sauce, but the strong curry spice couldn't cover the fishy smell. The fish head curry was so disappointing! When we told the waiter the fish was not fresh, he replied, the fish was cooked to order. My point is, cooking a fish that wasn't fresh in the first place doesnt make it any fresher! Another dish is the lamb dish. It was very chewy. Since they had a buffet in the afternoon that included this dish, I was wondering if they just gave us the leftovers. Additionally, one of my family members and I got bitten by a mosquito. My friend already made a reservation \u00a0in this restaurant, and after my dinner I immediately told them to cancel it.

Chicken-65 is something that you can find everywhere in India, it's fried chicken coated with spices. No complaints at all, my naan came piping hot and I devoured it with the scrumptious butter chicken in seconds. Their specialty is of course their curry, my friend had their curry chicken and I had a taste - its definitely far spicier than many indian curries that I've tried. Final verdict: Recommended for those who love their Indian food really hot and spicy!",
