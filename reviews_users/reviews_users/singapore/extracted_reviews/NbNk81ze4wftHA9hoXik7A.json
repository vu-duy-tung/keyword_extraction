    "text": "I've had dreams of the tendon I had in Kyoto occasionally, and it absolutely delighted me when I heard about the existence of this place.We came in early, so there was no queue. There is also the option of white rice and multi grain. I felt the white is more authentic to the tendon tradition so I went with that. For the menu, there is essentially 4 items, the kohaku don, and the veggie don, and spicy variations of those two.In my bowl, I found 3 pieces of shrimp, 2 pieces of chicken, 1 shitake mushroom, 1 pair of long beans, 1 baby corn, 1 piece of squid, and a piece of crab stick. I found some of the tempura-ed good unique, and not something you'd find in a traditional Japanese tendon, like the pieces of chicken and baby corn for example. It wasn't something I would personally want to have, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. The sauce that was paired with the rice was well-flavoured. Obviously it didn't live up to my expectations or my dreams of that Kyoto tendon. I also found the tempura greasy at times and not as light and crispy as I would have liked it to be.The restaurant itself is small and definitely more for a quick eat and go environment, and not somewhere you hang out for a long time catching up with someone.Definitely worth a try, if you're craving a good bowl of tendon but are restraint to the confines of Singapore.",

    "text": "My friend had recommended this place so I was curious to see how good it was. It is easy to identify the place among the other restaurants because it is the one with the longest queue. The batter was thin and the ingredients were fresh. Menu was simple and I wish they have an option for cuttlefish only since it is my favorite but the closest was a mixture of cuttlefish with other ingredients. For those who get tired of fried food easily or find it too oily, this place might prove to be the answer.",

    "text": "The restaurant was located at Eat At Seven in Suntec City. It was the first outlet in Singapore and was known for its long queue. Recently it had opened a second outlet in Boat Quay. As the queue was not long with about 10 persons in front of me during peak dinner hour, I decided to join the queue. The restaurant was small in size and packed. It took me about 25 minutes to get a seat. The place didn't smell.Menu was limited with mostly its signature Tendon in original($15++) or vegetable version, served with original sauce or spicy sauce. The set was an additional of udon soup with a topup of $4.50++. One could upsize the serving of rice with an additional of $1.50++. Looking at the menu, I decided on KOHAKU Tendon set ($19.50++). Iced water is provided free of charge.KOHAKU Tendon (S$15++/ ala carte)It looked great with a small bowl in it to put the the small hill of tempura on. There's pumpkin, baby corn, french bean (2 pieces), mushroom, chicken, crab stick, squid, and prawn (2 pieces) tempura. The vegetable ones were great but the prawn ones suck. Tasted strongly of stale oil, which covered the prawn's taste, made one felt jelat and wanted to gag. The udon soup was served simply with a slice of fish cake, tempura crumbles and chopped spring onion. The noodles was thin type, which was smooth. The soup was light and flavourful.Overall the food was overrated and quite expensive too. But then it was difficult to find a tendon place that did not smell.",

    "text": "And we're back! Yes, that is how much we enjoyed Kohaku. I don't normally write second reviews of the places I've visited but after the service I've received, I can't help but shower praises for the restaurant. Firstly, while we were waiting for our table, the restaurant manager had already seen us and given and acknowledging smile. We weren't sure if this was just an \"I acknowledge you're next smile\" or \"oh I recognize you smile\". This time round, we were seated at the bar and I have to admit that, you do smell a bit of the oil from the frying, but, they've probably improved their ventilation and it isn't as bad as some of the other places I've been. This time round, I decided to go with the Spicy version and OMG.... I'm in love. But more on that later. Upon ordering, the manager actually came up to us and thanked us for coming back! He actually recognized us! Which is brilliant considering the number of patrons they get a day. Having the chance to sit at the bar now, it gave me a good chance to oversee how they're operation works and I have to say, I'm nothing but impressed. I've received enquiries from friends asking how the place was and that they've heard that the waiting time and speed of service is horrendous. The kitchen and the front of house works like clockwork. I did wonder initially why the staff sometimes left tables empty when there was a queue outside and sitting at the bar showed me that. 1) The kitchen staffs don't just aimless and blindly fry the tempuras. They pace themselves based on orders and after 2 rounds of frying, they painstakingly remove all the little bits of floating flour in the oil, ensuring that they do not char and add that bitterness into the oil. 2) to ensure maximum freshness, they will only fry a batches of 5 at a time. After each round of sieving the oil, they will remove the fresh ingredients from the chiller, batter them and fry.3) the belief in absolute perfection. This I have to admit came as a big surprise for me. While placing the tempura's on each bowl, the chef had accidentally dropped a long bean on the counter top. Now this isn't any counter top, it's the one strictly used for plating. From where I was, it looked immaculate. Clean, shiny yet instead of placing the long bean back, he threw it away and told the cook to fry one more long bean immediately. Not fry with the next batch, but ONE long bean to add to the bowl (the fryer was empty then).Even the Japanese chef in charge of making the green tea does it with absolute precision, ensuring that each jug contained exactly the same amount of green tea powder to water ratio. I think it helps a lot when the manager, executive chef? (Not sure if you could call him that) and the main chef preparing the batter and drinks are all Japanese. There's a level precision with everything they do and you could sense that perfectionist attitude that the Japanese are known for. In all honesty? I don't mind waiting a little longer than usual knowing that so much care had gone into the preparation of my food. Now for the main highlight, the Spicy Kohaku Tendon Firstly, the smell. When the bowl came, that mixture of sweet, salty and spicy really got my palette racing. I couldn't wait to dig in! Secondly, I was so happy that they didn't give Okra. Instead, we got a slice of pumpkin today which was very well received. Do note that the vegetables here will vary so I won't be surprised if I get Okra the next time I return. Thirdly, that sauce. I thought I loved the original, until I tried the spicy version. It was perfect. The spiciness was prominent without overpowering the umami-ness of the sauce yet delivering a nice kick that helps elevate the dish. Amazingly, if I thought that our first visit was good, the food this round tasted even better. As we left the restaurant, the manager again showed his appreciation my giving us the lowest bow (90 degrees and maybe a little more) I've ever seen anyone give! A true sign of just how appreciative he was of us returning. That summed up our impression of Kohaku for us and if I could give it a 5.5-6* rating I would. Thoroughly impressed and delightfully satisfied, we're counting down the days to our next visit!",

    "text": "Not a fan of tempura but this blew me away. The long queues on regular days piqued my curiosity, and I decided to give it a try. The ordering process is really simple-you choose from spicy/non spicy, all veggies or veggies, seafood and chicken, and whether you'd like it as a set (with udon) or not.I ordered the regular with veggies, seafood and chicken. The bowl was filled with prawn, beans, corn, and chicken breast tempura. The batter was a thin layer that coated the various ingredients and was not too filling, while all the ingredients remained crunchy and did not lose their original flavour. This was especially so for the chicken breast, which was surprisingly not dry and went well with the tempura batter. I particularly enjoyed the mushroom, which was chewy and juicy. Priced at $15, this is indeed worth a trip down for a try. (Just note the gst & service charge which inflates the price as usual)",

Everything was well-seasoned, and the tempura batter was crispy; it was clear the restaurant used quality ingredients. Also, I loved the brown tempura sauce drizzled over the dish, although some may probably find it a little too sweet and overpowering. The only low point was the chicken, as I found it too overwhelming in size, and not tender enough. However, it was still a very solid bowl of tendon.Highly recommended.",
