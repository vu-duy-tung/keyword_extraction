    "text": "This ranks as my 4 half stars ramen restaurant! Their ramen is so thick, rich and flavourful. Was shopping some months ago at isetan and happened to see that there's no queue and went ahead with it, seems like I've found treasure!If u don't take pork, it's ok as they have chicken base soup that's almost the best I've had so far in Singapore!!! (Hands down) i would say the taste is suited to singaporean's preference. For the chicken soup base ramen, they have it either spicy or non spicy, they're different in taste (although the waiter will tell u the difference is only in spicy was, but it's not). I'll always both spicy and non-spicy at the same time, as it can get a little 'gelard' taking the same soup continuously. I switch between both of them, it helps refresh the palette. Mega love for this ramen shop!! My must go to each time I'm here for a movie at shaw.",

    "text": "So I read Sanpoutei Ramen hails from Niigata, Japan and it has been around since 1967.I also read the Tonkotsu Ramen there was not good. So I decided to stay away from it but opted for the Niigata Shoyu Ramen which Sanpoutei is famous for. Have a list of places to try in Singapore, clearly Sanpoutei is not in that list. Honestly I have never heard of Sanpoutei. Yes, I do go to Isetan Scotts for my grocery needs when I am in Singapore; I have probably past by the restaurant before but never pay any attention to it. \u00a0Sanpoutei was recommended by a friend who suggested we met up for lunch. FOOD 3.5/5I ordered the Niigata Shoyu Ramen. I like the noodles having this QQ (springy) texture. The broth was flavorful. The egg was how it should be. I was not too crazy about the aburi chashu. They were so thin and small :( Overall, it was not a ramen that would make me want to keep coming back. AMBIENCE 4/5It was a nice and cozy place. The staff let me choose where I wanted to sit. I took that booth seating. SERVICE 3.5/5It was not bad. Had to ask the staff twice for a glass of iced water though. Payment was made at the front next to the entrance. \u00a0It was an A-ok lunch but my lunch company was an A+ :)",

    "text": "It's actually a 3.5 for me, because it deserves better than a yellow 3, but it's just average that I wouldn't come back craving for this particular bowl. The noodles texture is great, and the broth is fragrant and smooth. Not too salty, but flavorful. I quite liked the side dishes, the chicken. It was on the oily side though, so you might want to take note and tell the servers if you have dietary preferences. or just dab it with the napkins on the tables. Servers were averagely nice, and you pay at the cashier when you're done, or at least I did. They take credit card, nets and cash, so payment is a breeze. There's another Sanpoutei in Holland Village, and I live closer to that one... I might try that one to see if the quality is consistent between branches.",

    "text": "One of the highlight of our Singapore holiday was when we dined at Sanpoutei Ramen at Shaw House. Neko No Niwa's owners Sam and Sue recommended the Shoyu Ramen from Sanpoutei. We visited Neko No Niwa everytime we went to Singapore and it was a great feeling to get to know amazing people who really cared about cats wellbeing. Sam and Sue travelled to Japan quite often and they said Sanpoutei's broth was one of the best in Singapore. So we took their advice and took a cab there.We got a bit lost when we arrived at Shaw House and I even had to google the shop front picture of Sanpoutei Ramen. I didn't realised that it was only located outside of the Shaw's Food Republic and that we walked past it a few times... (lol).It was quite a late dinner and we quickly decided on what we wanted to eat. Hubby chose the Tsukemen and I ordered the Niigata Shoyu Ramen. Tsukemen is when a bowl of ramen served dry and need to be dipped into rich bowl of soup first.I loved my Niigata Shoyu ramen which came with two slices of aburi chashu and flavoured soft-boiled egg. The noodle was chewy, springy and easy to eat. The broth was quite light in texture but rich in flavour.Hubby's tsukemen was served with a bowl of thick sardine and bonito broth. The staff informed him that a pot of plain Wari soup can be used together with the remaining broth. Wari soup is a plain soup stock. I was quite wary that the flavour of the soup might be fishy but it was delicious! The size of the noodle was definitely quite a lot since it was 1.5x more than usual.There are 4 fun facts that need to be learnt about Sanpoutei Ramen:The secret of Sanpoutei delicious broth lies in the dashi or soup stock that they used. Two different dried sardine was imported directly from Japan and was stewed for more than 7 hours to create rich broth.Kotoyo shoyu brewery that Sanpoutei uses also located in Niigata and founded in the year 1848, 119 years before the creation of Sanpoutei. The shoyu was prepared in wooden barrel.Sanpoutei's 'keep warm' ramen bowl was specially manufactured in Tsubamesahiyo, Niigata. Sanpoutei made their own four layer fresh noodle which was springy and silky at the same time. Definitely check out Sanpoutei Ramen if you have a chance to do so in Singapore. At least you don't have to make a trek all the way too Niigata ;-)",

So after shopping for a while, went to this restaurant around 9.30pm since there's no line.Ordered A2, Niigata Shoyu with full topping.The broth: just like my mom's chicken broth, which i thought is very standardThe noodle: thicker than usual, and i prefer thinner onesThe chasiu: thicker cut than usual & less fat, which again i prefer the opposite The egg: cooked too long. The egg yolk is already hard, not runny enoughThe bamboo soot: it's thick but very tender & flavorful. This is the nicest part of the ramen actuallySo overall not the best ramen i've tasted and would not order that again, but the ramen that's dipped in sauce looks good. Might come to try that one.",

    "text": "The shoyu ramen reminded me of the better places in Tokyo. Very strong sardine-flavoured soup, almost like fish soup, and completely unlike the typical \"shoyu\" ramen served in Singapore (which is closer to water with a dash of soy sauce and pepper), perhaps the more common place to find this intense cooked fish flavour is in tsukemen like Menya Musashi, or Southern French fish soup. The pork was thick, fatty and soft and melting and clearly a cut above the stuff usually served in terms of taste. The tonkotsu soup was also appreciated.Price is high, as expected considering the ingredients and location. Shoyu is $15, everything else $17-19. You know this before stepping in though as this is roughly where all the ramen places in Singapore have colluded to fix their price.The room was half empty on a Sunday afternoon.",

    "text": "The first branch I came across was at Holland Village. Wanted to try a few times but price kept my distance. When my mother asked where to eat, since I have yet tried this ramen chain, this place came to my mind.Parking was easy probably cause it is a Friday 11am. This store opens at 11.30am and the staff didn't let us in before it opens. Since there wasn't a listing of this chain on Yelp, I asked for the unit number cause it wasn't visible. The staff wasn't to impressed with me confirming the unit number so she did smirk a bit. Mom and aunt went in first and got seated on one of the best seats (according to myself) cause I was able to take good pictures of its interior design. Took plenty and wasn't ready when my mother called the server over. I had to decide in less than 2 minutes and decided for the tonkotsu special. For the drinks, I had to rethink of what I would like and the server was a little impatient and so I just go for ice green tea.Food came. Was actually liking my food. Soup base was tasty and not too oily (from the pork fats), the ingredients were two pieces of seaweeds, spring onions, an egg cut into halves and a few others which I can't recall. Tonkotsu was not too greasy as I thought it might be and the noodles was cooked right. I think pricing wise was the thing that minus 0.5 star rating.Overall, ambience wise it was very cosy but might not have the same impact of the restaurant is full. It is opposite of a food court too so many people will prefer wider range of food choices. Will be back to one of the chains soon. :)",

I figured there was a lot of hype about this place seeing the long lines at around 6pm on a Friday night. My wife and I were easily able to get a seat on a rainy Saturday at 4pmTo my dismay, the Shoyu ramen I ordered had soggy noodles. To top it off, The light broth didn't help as well. You sometimes hope the broth is good enough to hide the mistakes of the noodle. Unfortunately, this one just missed the spot. it had all the makings to be a great noodle, but something was just off.The Butariki don was another story. A cracked egg layered on top of beef strips and rice was a HEAVENLY SUPRISE. The heavenly surprise came from a spicy kick that I usually don't \u00a0associate with beef strips. In short, skip the noodles (may have a had a bad batch) and go for the rice dishes.",
