I can see why some people love their congee for the smooth texture, but I personally find it is too smooth to be considered porridge - more like blended rice soup. Really generous portion, with great taste. They don't heat up individual serving of porridge when customers place their orders, which is a no-no for me too. Porridge ends up being lukewarm when served with a raw egg. In theory, porridge is supposed to be piping hot and the egg will be cooked instantaneously when added to the porridge.",

It's very similar to ceviche and tastes excellent too.For two medium bowls of fish jook and the sashimi salad, it'll cost you $S10.So far, my single best food experience in my brief stay here in Singapore.As this place opens at 5:30am, I wouldn't be surprised if people camp the night before to get this porridge greatness.",

There's a ginormous pot (more like a huge tank w an automatic stirrer) cooking the porridge, then the 1 and only chef move each porridge portion into small pots and cook w the meat of choice (fish, chicken, century old egg or combination).It was worth the wait!!! We got the small $3 bowl to share w fish, chicken, and century old egg. Wow big portion for $3.. We promised to save stomach space to eat \u00a0food from other stalls but everyone spoon we ate had meat/ egg in it, that's how much content it had.

    "text": "Feel like I may end up being smote by some Foodie God for not giving Zhen Zhen Fish Porridge a 5 star review but here goes.Do not underestimate the mettle of this store. Maxwell is a stone's throw from my office so I frequent it often enough to be certain that this mystical porridge holds an amazing sway over the masses - the storefront is almost never without a snaking queue. Waiting time is anywhere between 30 - 45 mins, so bring along a book or play many rounds of scramble with friends to avoid ending up questioning your sanity. Patience has never been one my strongest suits so the wait made me a tad grouchier and enraged my expectation of the food to a few notches too high.Let's start with the best bit of the meal. The yu-sheng was spot-on - I can almost confidently say it is the best I have tasted in Singapore. Fresh fish slices are lightly marinated before being tossed with fragrant sesame seeds and crunchy spring onions. Patrons get to top it off by squeezing on some zesty lime juice. The hawker lady generously threw 6 limes into my box of $5 yu-sheng and I was a little perplexed by this plentitude but decided to go for 3 which turned out just perfect. \u00a0 On to the porridge. The uniform consistency of the thick white gruel is certainly a feat. Every single rice grain has been subjected to prolonged methodical stirring that has ensured the gruel's acclaimed homogenity. And therein may also lie the reason as to why I am a staunch 4-star fan - being Teochew, my ideal porridge has got to have fluffy bits of rice grains still intact so this doesn't quite cut it for me.Despite my irrational porridge discrimination, I must say that stall is generous with the ingredients that go into each bowl. I ordered the century egg and sliced fish porridge and had a sliver of meat to go with every single spoonful - a rarity nowadays. All in all, try this if you aren't going to lose your temper over the wait. I am definitely more of a true blue Zhen Zhen Yu Sheng fan.",

The yu sheng tastes good because there is no bone (there are so many out there which has small bones still stuck on the fish) and are sliced thinly. It tastes good with the sesame oil, black and white sesame seeds, and the garnish. For the porridge, even if you order the plain one, trust me it's smooth and tasty. It probably does not have the Crystal Jade plain porridge standard, but with the generous amount of sesame oil and sesame seeds, it's perfect to go along with the yu sheng.It gets sold out pretty early, and the wait can be pretty long. But I assure you that this is definitely worth the wait!",
