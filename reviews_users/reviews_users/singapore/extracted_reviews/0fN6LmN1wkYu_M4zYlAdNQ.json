    "text": "TL;DR: clear cooking skills, fantastic location, but questionable wine.We walked past this restaurant for years. I love the location, but thought it would cultivate a tourist trap. Turns out the chef knows what he is doing. This is one of maybe a handful of times in years that lobster was soft under the fork, perfectly cooked instead of the usual rubbery texture I've come to expect from Singaporean chefs. The snapper was, again, spot on. They made the most of the medium steak with even texture showing perfect control. The chef also knows how to balance salt and seasonings, again something less common here and it took me straight back to the Mediterranean of my youth. Pasta was al dente with a well seasoned and balanced bolognese ragu which I managed to get through despite being full before starting it. Every other table was having pizza so I guess that's what we're trying next.I would have 5 starred it but the Primitivo had very clear volatile acidity (when bacteria trapped in the wine produces acetic acid, leaving a stench of vinegar). This is not an unknown problem with Italian wines and it was still early enough that I could drink it by holding my nose (Primitivo has enough fruit to offset the acidity). But at $12 a glass, in a restaurant where the staff clearly has a trained palate, this is a real shame. It means I won't risk wine at further visits and they will lose the profit I was happy to give them. A bottle of decent Primitivo from 2016 is probably $20-30 to import, hardly a huge hit on the bottom line. I'm sad because it is hard to find a place that cooks meat and especially fish so well, and I was looking forward to pairing it in the future. Tables are relatively close together and the popularity of the restaurant (despite its rating here) meant that it got pretty loud. By 9pm we could not hear each other across the table. I measured an average of 55dB with my phone with peaks at 65dB, about the same as someone drilling through the other side of a wall. Outdoors was better for that reason, despite the excellent presentation of the white tablecloths and fountain behind the dining room.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this well-visited Italian, but the few disappointments were too significant to award a high rating. Highs & lows:- Riverfront setting along one of the most pleasant stretches of the SG River, though the patio was not as leafy as at other nearby spots. - Quick to be seated and quick to be served. Service was snappy but not warm & personable, except for the guys who brought the bread & water - they were the stars. - Pizza crust was a bit soggy, not at all like the nicely-finished northern Italian I'm used to (can't speak to the other regions). Toppings were fairly good but the so-called \"prosciutto\" was not that at all, more like a Parma ham, and less tasty at that. - Price-point was more like 3$, not the 4$ in the listing. (Not sure if Yelp provides formal definitions, though.)Rating: 4* for the setting, 2* for the food (given the price-point, the food should have been outstanding but wasn't). Overall 3*.",

Also enjoyed the usual margherita pizza.It's nicer to sit outside when the weather permits - then you get a view of the river and can people watch if you so desireBasically, i come here when i feel tired and can't be bothered to be creative about where i want to go eat.",

    "text": "Limoncello is located at the end of Robertson Quay. I've been here twice, once with a big group of 16 for a birthday party. Bad experience. Understandably, we went on a Friday night, and things were pretty hectic, but service was pretty bad. It's in the range of La Villa, but the service is way below that of La Villa.We were seated at a long table toward the back of the restaurant and throughout the dinner a large majority of my group complained of the insufferable heat. I was fine actually, but for some of them it got so bad that they went outside, and only re-entered the restaurants when the dishes arrived. Which brings me to the point of the food. We had to wait pretty long for our dishes, and finally, when they did arrive our orders were messed up. \u00a0They accidentally gave us two portions of the Bolognese, so I tried some of it - very standard fare. We also ordered two Spaghetti Al Cartoccio which is spaghetti with mixed seafood wrapped in baking paper in light tomato sauce. Unfortunately, only one of this arrived and we kept waiting and explaining to them that we were expecting a second one - it never came and we eventually cancelled it. Anyway, apart from the mess-up my friend who did get the dish raved that this was really quite delicious, and there was generous portions of seafood. As for me, I got the Spaghetti Carbonara, which was standard quality - nothing to write home about. I suppose I wasn't expecting much anyway, ... so I'd suggest ordering the Al Cartoccio if you do come here. In total I spent about $30, so that's quite reasonable for standard Italian fare. It's kind of a nice restaurant with some potential, and a nice ambience for a date, but perhaps not the best for a group dinner.",

    "text": "The pasta dishes are OK now, and the pizzas are still good, but they have reduced the size of the pizzas! You pay $50 for 2 small pizzas and that is just ridiculous. The smaller size is obvious because 1) you are still hungry after eating a pizza and 2) if you take away, the box which they have been using for years has a lot of space now since the pizza size has been reduced.I say reduce the pricing for each pizza then or increase the pizza size again so customers feel they are not ripped off.",

I've sat outside as well as the bar area before and think the main dining area is the most comfortable. Antipasti platter was v nice - Parma ham,Burrata, tomatoes, rocket, roasted peppers. I had the barramundi today - fresh product was nicely roasted. I would order this again.",
