    "text": "Went there on a Saturday morning around 11am in an obvious attempt to avoid the crowd. Evidently, pretty much everyone else had the same bright idea. Victor's Kitchen opens at 1030am, and by the time we got there, it was packed to the brim with couples and families.Food: The glutinous rice with chicken and sausage was excellent. And this is coming from someone who's not a big fan of carbs. Really liked the zhar leung (i.e. fried doughstick in rice roll), was pretty much the closest we've had to Hong Kong fare. The har gau and siew mai were so-so, not exceptional. The carrot cake with XO sauce was unusual but not exceptional, and the custard buns were just so-so. The mango pomelo sago's pretty good. The iced milk tea though, was absolutely kickass. Victor's Kitchen is the ONLY place which serves iced milk tea identical to the famous stocking iced milk tea in Hong Kong's Fa Yuen Street.Ambience: For a relatively ghetto hole in the wall dim sum joint, it's acceptable. Service: Pretty decent, they try to do their best given the crowds. And I love being surrounded by authentic Cantonese speaking wait staff. This is the real deal.They close around 10pm so it's a decent place for a bite after work if one gets off late.",

I'd say out of everything I ordered it was 50-50 on what I liked and didn't like. So I probably won't come again, though they seem popular enough.Ordering is simple. You fill out the paper form for both food and drinks, then pay at the cashier. While the owners might be Cantonese, almost all employees are Mando-speaking only. Couldn't get by at all ordering in Canto when I went.",

The tables and chairs are already on the small side (for someone bigger in size than your average Asian girl). Long tables which can generally sit to a squeeze of 8, they decide to fit 10. Not very impress with this. However, food wise, yes, they serve a delicious salted egg lava bun, great chicken feet, Cheung fun too. Coffee, tea, coffee tea mix all good (drinks abit on the pricy side). So go early, go for the experience of you have not been to those tiny places in Hong Kong, good food, but be prepared to be pushed, asked to move, asked to sit a bit off, loads of excuse me (if you are lucky, otherwise just be prepared to have an uncomfortable sitting experience while enjoying good food).",

You work around City Hall area and the chance of enjoying authentic dim sum that's affordable yet awesome is not something that's easily achieved.Thus I was extremely happy to walk in to this tiny shop, squeeze into some tight spaced tables to enjoy some really delicious dim sum, sharing my table with other strangers who equally enjoy their meal.If you have heard stories about scary aunty, they are true. But they are ok, just smile and remind yourself that nothing can be worse than having to work in a tiny shop like this one for long hours in a hot kitchen. Anyway, scary aunty aside, the food is superb! Love the carrot cake (XO SAUCE, yo!), love the liu sha bao, love the pork rib rice, love the glutinous rice (wrapped in leaf), love the prawn dumpling, love the fried beancurd skin...i Love everything...I cant wait to go back again!!",

    "text": "To do: find real authentic dim sum Status: checked. Yes, din tai fung doesn't disappoint. But as I develop taste for Asian food, living in Singapore I get greedy and crave for something beyond. So while on the look out for good dim sum that hasn't been all fancied-up by us expats, came across quite a few posts on this place. Then our office move happened and found myself working only ~10 minutes walk away from here. So it finally happened. Food was great. My Chinese friend approved its authenticity and way above-par taste (and even over-ate -- this is someone who DOES NOT over-eat.) * Egg tarts (4/5) were really good. Very fluffy & light with crisp crust on the outside. *Siew Mai's (3/5) were okay. I definitely had better ones before. Didn't particularly find them flavorful. * Har gao (4/5) -- yes! The shrimp meats were thick & tangy. Enough said. * Spinach & Prawn dumplings(3.5/5) also had good shrimp meat inside & had stickiness and juice that went well together. But would've liked it better if there was a bit less skin of the dumpling. * Chee-chong fun with Charsiew (3.5/5) was decent as well. Now that I think about it, perhaps I don't like the dumpling skin-like things too much in general. * Carrot cake, I can't say much about because I am not a fan to begin with. So will refrain from commenting. * Spicy sauce chicken claws (a.k.a. chicken feet) (4.5/5) was a wow! I've heard many things about how it has lots of collagen and all & tried several times, but one bite was enough for each of those. But this time, it was different. The sauce was just the right spiciness with really delicious flavor. Best chicken feet I've had so far. I will definitely order this again. * Steamed spare ribs with black bean sauce (4.5/5) was another win. Well-steamed to the right level of tanginess, just the right amount of flavor that brings out the taste of the rib, while not being bland. Loved it. * Golden \"Bo Lo\" Char Siew Butter Buns (4/5) were very tasty. Crips on the outside, filled with rich char siew fillings on the inside. But to me, it was a bit too saucy. Still good, but a bit more meat and less sauce would've hit the golden balance. * Double-boiled egg white with fresh milk and almond juice (2.5/5) was okay. Too much almond taste for a double-boiled egg. * Golden Egg Yolk Lava Buns (3.5/5) -- supposedly the most popular dish here -- didn't impress me too much. Expected the inside to be a bit more rich gooey liquid fullness but didn't really happen. The mixture didn't seem to be very well mixed. Still decent.  I will be trying Charsiew Baos and some porridge the next time I go. Service is not bad, but the food doesn't come out too fast either. (Having heard of the long queue, I went pretty early-- a bit before noon -- but the food still came out rather slow and came in a staggered manner, not in any particular oder. Perhaps my personal preference but I like my dimsums to just come all at once for me to gawk at the variety and steaminess all together.) But let's just think that that's how fresh the dimsums are? as they are made to order? The ambiance is not somewhere you'd just walk by and be invited to go in. But I think it's part of the authentic experience. So I loved it and would definitely be bringing my friends here.",

I expect you're really expecting some sort of verdict on the famed liushabaos (those salted egg yolk custard lava buns) and those were pretty disappointing. it was very oily, with much of the fat having separated from the paste, and it didn't really ooze (not even with a less-than-gently squeeze). flavor-wise, I think it could have done with a bit more salt.the menu is small, but it's cheap, and it's rather like those eateries you get in old-town malaysia or hong kong. I'm not sure a revisit is in my future - I'd rather spend a bit more and get better quality - but it's a decent option in the future, though definitely un-rave-worthy.",

When i arrived it was just as people commented 'small, tiny place'. Did wait awhile to find a seat and had to call the waitress a few times to get the order chit. Aside from these, the food was not bad. I decided to try the summer milk tea which sounded yummy, indeed it was. However i thought that it was quite expensive $3 for a cup of tea, it was akin to buying a cup of Koi bubble tea with pearls. Next we tried the highly acclaimed items such as the siew mai, custard bun, king prawn dumpling and hong kong style pan fried chee chiong fun (rice roll). The siew mai was really good with actual crab roe on top of it and it was flavourful, juicy and succulent. The custard bun was really smooth and creamy and went well with the texture of the fluffy bun.The dumpling was a giveaway as for that price, the amount of filling given was really worth it. The succulent skin was so thin yet maintained a bouncy and chewy feel and alot of filling was wrapped into that skin, it was as if it was going to burst anytime. Next came the hong kong style chee chiong fun and it was interesting i must say. Have never tried anything like it, crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside, yummy. The service there however was not really good, they seemed to favour westerners more than us. Overall a good experience with some misses.",

The selling point at Victor's might be its authenticity in its owners \u00a0- they sound like they hail from Hong Kong - and their drinks - the closest you'll get to HK milk tea. Prices are decent but I thought the food was just okay.We had the usual fare: har gau, siew mai, shrimp chang fen, beancurd skin with pork stuffing, steamed carrot cake and custard buns. Nothing to shout about, I've had far better dim sum. They forgot our order of the you tiao chang fen or there was some mix-up. It was so busy and chaotic that we didn't bother to ask them.The real highlights of the meal were the drinks. Iced milk tea - hot tea served in a plastic cup in a bowl of ice cubes so the tea isn't diluted when the ice melts. Pretty novel idea and the tea is close to what you get at cha chan ting's in HK. We saw the auntie pounding the lemon slices too when she made the iced lemon tea, one of the better homemade versions I've tried.Come for the experience, if you're looking for a piece of Hong Kong in Singapore.",

    "text": "I first came here after hearing people RAVE about a authentic, bona-fide Hong Kong chef. It was ALL TRUE.Walking in, you hear all the right sounds. Loud Cantonese from the kitchen. A grumpy auntie who ignores you until you wave in her face, then tells you to wait for a seat. A smiley auntie who clears your table, and cajoles a smile out of you as she complains about the grumpy auntie. And of course you see the rest of the crowd who's there to eat. And you know you can't go wrong. The food did not disappoint either. The steamed carrot cake was pleasantly surprising - bits of scallops and waxed sausage (lup cheong) mixed in an almost coarse pudding - and the XO sauce adds a little extra zing.The rest of the food passes by in a haze, and we harry the auntie for more, but you'll remember to order the Zhar Leong (cheong fun with you tiao), and have some ice summer milk tea - they cool the drink by placing the cup in a bowl of ice, so it gets cooled without being diluted. Old School much.And of course, you'll finish your meal with some Golden Egg Yolk Lava Buns. Everyone does, as long as they still have some in stock. You might call it Liu Sha Bao, but here at Victor's, everything's got a cooler name.A couple of months ago, we heard about a change in the family situation, and the food quality may have changed, but subsequent visits don't show noticeable differences. Give it a go, it don't cost much any way.",

    "text": "In a small and cramped shop space, Victor's Kitchen serves authentic Hong Kong dim sum that is cheap and good. It is a really narrow shop though, so be prepared to sit a little too close for comfort next to a stranger from the next table. To order, you tick your selected dishes on an order slip and hand in to a waitress. The waitresses, however, are extremely slow at attending to customers. It usually takes ages just to get their attention. Alas, they do serve a few recommendable dishes, the best being Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun aka custard pau. The custard paus are unbeatable; I have not tasted any better. The piping hot custard filling oozes out the moment you break open the skin. The sweetness of the custard and the saltiness of the preserved egg yolk make a perfect marriage. Another good dish is the Siew Mai - a dim sum classic. Their version was tasty, had a strong porky taste and had a great texture to it.",

    "text": "Who said brunch had to be western? The Chinese have been getting up at noon and peeling wax paper off char siew buns for ages, and if you're sick of heavy and extravagant Western fare, but need a heart-warming Chinese entre\u00e9 to start your day that won't hurt your wallet, you're at the right place.Start off by getting a basket of Victor's signature Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun ($3.50 for 3), and be careful when you split it the middle to let steam out, because the glorious golden filling might just ooze out (and make a mess!). When it's cool enough to eat, savour the sweet-salty and gooey salted egg yolk-based custard. While we're still talking buns, a basket of Milky Custard Buns ($3.50 for 3) is sure to delight both pau & dessert fans with its decadently smooth custard interior and melt-in-your-mouth silky skin.And what's Yum Cha without har gow ($3.50 for 4)? Bite into one of these steamed prawn dumplings and be surprised by the crunch - wrapped in a crystalline, semi-see-through skin are three whole shrimps and delicious pork filling. Another dumpling that is a must-have is their Tasty Queen Size Siew Mai ($3.50 for 4). Larger than your average siew mai, these bundles of joy are sure to put a smile on your face with delight, though they might be too overpowering with umami and a little bit too salty.Order a cup of Hong Kong Summer Ice Tea ($2.00) to accompany the baskets of buns and dumplings, and be impressed by their genius - the tea is served in a cup that is placed in a bowl of ice, so you don't have to worry about your tea getting too mellow with dilution",

    "text": "Sunday afternoons are for family brunches, and dimsum was our food of choice today. Headed down to Victor's Kitchen for their liu sha bao since I was nursing a serious craving for them. Well, everyone else had the same brunch idea so even though we came down at 2+pm, it was packed and the queue was long. We queued for about 15 minutes before it was our turn. Note of caution: No one is going to serve you at the front of the restaurant, so head on straight to an empty table when you sight one. The place was completely packed, and at Victor's, that means Hong Kong-style claustrophobia. Be prepared to wriggle your way in and out of the restaurant (if you can call it that) because of the ultra dense seating arrangement. After a rather unpleasantly long wait for the food, cheong fun was served. It was one of the highlights of the meal. Another winner was the steamed carrot cake that was served pudding style. I enjoyed it, but I wish it came with more sauce. Some other dishes that came were disappointing. The siew mai tasted stale, and the ha gao was over steamed. The steam pork ribs and fried toufu skin with prawns were unmemorable. Fortunately, the liu sha bao was decent and satisfied my craving. Best eaten the moment it reaches your table, this bun is filled with a sugary and salty custard that flows out the moment you sink your teeth into it. The Hong Kong iced milk tea is good too.Not the best place for dim sum, but if you want a true Hong Kong-style dim sum dining experience, head here.",
