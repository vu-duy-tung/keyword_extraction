    "text": "Singapore is a wonderful place for food lovers of all type - including food hawkers. Today, we were particularly craving for some rustic street food. That's why our morning was spent roaming around Hong Lim Food Center. Hong Lim Food Center is located right in the heart of Chinatown. Therefore, this place can be seen as one of the most rustic street food places in Singapore. Offering authentic Chinese dishes with added twists of the Singaporeans, foods here are out of the world!We tried fried Kway Teow Mee, which in our opinion, is a superb dish. This wok dish is not too oily, yet smoky and very flavorful, thanks to the secret mixture of soy sauce and fish sauce. It's evenly coated in beaten egg, creating a semi-wet \"Pad Thai-like\" dish. The smoke flavor come from the hot wok really makes this dish especially memorizing for us.Recommendation: Kway Teow Mee (stall 02-17)For more review, visit us at: thecoupleeats.com/singap\u2026",

    "text": "One of my favourite hawker food centre for lunch in Singapore! My top 4 recommended food stalls are:(1) Cantonese Delights wanton noodle, located at the 2nd floor at the corner with long queue daily. The owners are very friendly, the char siew so far the best I've tried in this market and full of a variety of choices such as curry gravy, chicken cutlets, yong tao fu and etc.(2) Jin Hua \u91d1\u83ef Fish Head Bee Hoon (2nd flr), I like the very thick milky soup which is more indulgent and creamier.(3) An Kee Braised Duck Rice (2nd flr), cheap and nice. The duck meat was braised nicely with flavour, and the 'herbal' soup is my favourite overall.(4) Fragrant Hong Kong Pork Rib Rice (2nd flr), I used to eat the steamed rice with chicken / pork rib, it's soft and juicy!There're more nice foods like Koay Chap, Mixed soup / Seafood soup, Malays food and etc which I couldn't remember their name :D Free free to explore over there!",

    "text": "Uber local, a bit grimy and pay for use toilets- Hong Lim came highly rated - however, found that the food at Maxwell seemed to be of higher quality and the hawker centre cleaner. We had the famous pork noodle and fried kway teo which wasn't really anything to write home about. We enjoyed the curry puff and the rice dumplings (nyonya rice dumpling was really different and yummy). But next time I will just give this one a miss and try the Chinatown one or go back to Maxwell to get my fill of local food.",

    "text": "HL didn't really stand out to me as a tourist, when I went to hawker fares.I had lunch here and a cup of fresh juice, and prices were just average. I found that juice was cheaper in Chinatown! Surprise surprise. AND just as good. I had a fish soup with noodles, and it seemed pretty slow that lunch time even with all the students and business people eating there. The vendor had to take out some fish cuts from his plastic tupperware underneath the stand and put it into the soup to make my meal. That's how slow it was!Anyhow, the place isn't too dirty which is a plus. And shoutout to the REAL MVP's of the food centre...the old ladies and men who wear bright green/orange and pick up after your dirty tables! They're the ones who are tirelessly working hard to clean tables so the next round of customers can have a place to eat. There wasn't a diverse selection in my opinion, but I did notice that it was pretty accessible between our itinerary as we walked around Ann Siang Hill, Clarke Quay, Chinatown, and even parts of Maxwell Centre. Good location, basic stalls.",

    "text": "Well, it was my first day in Singapore and I was looking for some place to eat (not actually knowing all that much about the place mind you) so I decided to check out Chinatown, suspecting that I would find some really authentic restaurants down there. Anyway, my first discovery when I steps out of the MRT station was your standard shopping mall with standard shopping mall cafes, however when I walked outside I suddenly found myself in this place - my first experience of a Singapore Hawker's Market. I must say that I was instantly impressed. Okay, it is nowhere near as large as the Chinatown Complex, but I hadn't discovered that at this stage, so I spent some time wandering up and down the stalls. The juice stall that I came across was amazing, especially since they offered drinks that would never exist in Australia. Here I had a dragonfruit and mango juice, but I also down many, many watermelon juices in my time here. All I can say is that if you are in Singapore and are looking for a place to eat, the hawker's markets are the place to go.",
