Here, traditional Singaporean Cantonese dishes are served in a hip ambience, albeit the traditional display of aquariums of live fish and shell fish visible as we entered the establishment. The 9 of us had the dinner set menu D which IMO is priced very reasonably. We were fortunate the place wasn't quite 50% filled on a Wednesday evening so we were served very quickly. Most of the dishes were portioned and served individually to us. We appreciated we didn't have to carve from an entire fish complete with its head and tail which can turn some off. Every item in the set menu was well put together and very tasty, there wasn't anything anyone did not like.",

They gave us a small plate of fried fish skin before the food comes. Normally, you wouldn't think they charge for it in the US. Like how restaurants give you bread before your food comes out. But here, they charge you $4 for that stupid plate of fish skin! What a ripoff! The guy who was like a manager had a really bad attitude. This place sucks!",

The presentation of the vegetable dish (spinach saut\u00e9ed with garlic) though was nicely placed (we were more amused by this since we were not expecting sauteed spinach to be a fancy-looking veggie dish).

    "text": "Besides the really cool name and mysterious/dark d\u00e9cor, the Dim Sum here is delicious and made with good quality ingredients. The staff are trained to provide prompt service and old and young alike are very pro-active.Our verdict:- Steamed village radish cake: this is the steam version of the fried carrot cake. It's a new dish on their Spring menu and I must say, it offers a different take on the traditional dim sum type of carrot cake. It's hard to describe it holistically but the picture says it all. Try this but note that the portion is quite huge if you're in a group of 2 so it may be best to cut down on other filling carbs if you wanna order this.- Prawn beancurd roll: the smell of this simply makes my mouth water. The portion is kinda small (3 pcs) for $7 but the taste is heavenly. The skin is fried to perfection and complements well with the inner fillings. This is my must-order dish on every visit.- Century egg and pork porridge: I never fail to order this dish every time I have dim sum but somehow this dish is a-ok; not too good not too bad. There are a few measly pieces of pork and century egg pieces but the texture of the porridge is faultless. Suggest to skip this dish if you have other interesting items to order on the menu.- Pan-fried juicy meat buns (3 pcs): another new item on the Spring menu and I gave up my order of Xiao Long Bao just because of the word 'juicy' and I thought it would be interesting to see how something juicy could be pan-fried! However, I was disappointed as it was anything but juicy. It's my expectations failing me! Other then it being not juicy as I expected, the buns were of a good size and the meat filling was quite flavourful. Why isn't it juicy?- Hot and Sour Dumplings (4 pcs): another dish that I absolutely love; the hotness and sourness is just right! A warning though, it may be a bit too spicy for those who are unable to take spicy food.I am already planning to return within the next two weeks and it's one of the places I would recommend to friends if they are craving for some Dim Sum within the Harbourfront area.",

The setting was sleek and I expected the prices to be higher than other overcrowded chain Chinese restaurants but was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices. My friend had typical dim sum items like char siew bun and har gow. The dim sum baskets were unique. I ordered abalone prawn congee which is one of the best congee I have ever eaten. Most restaurants use the same plain congee as the base and just add ingredients as per the order, such that prawn congee is just plain congee+prawns but the one I had here tasted like the congee was cooked with the prawns long enough to absorb the essence. Highly recommended!",

The waitress taking my order was rather condescending, it could be how we are dressed. Four adults and two children, all wearing tee shirt and shorts. Asked her to intro food after ordering a porridge, a fried rice, and two noodles. She said these should be enough for us. I then ordered the liu sha bao and the Xiao long bao as sides. The orders took a while to arrive and after eating everything, the fried rice never showed. Asked 2 waiters and still nothing, just told us to wait. So went to the lady at the counter and she just took my receipts and walked away. Few mins later she came back and from a distance away said very loudly that they are frying now. I responded just as loudly to cancel the order as the wait was too ridiculous. So food wise, someone said the prawn porridge is good, I disagree. It's very watery although the prawns are very fresh. The stir fry udon is cooked with vinegar, so taste like vinegar. The other Chinese noodles is cooked with sweet sauce, slightly better but taste sweet. (Didn't even bother to remember the names)The Xiao long bao and the liu sha bao is nice though. Anyway, I won't go there again. Bad service and expensive. Forget it.",

It did stood out to me. Thanks to Nayoung (one of the organizers for the babies showers), who made the reservation, we were able to sit in a big round table for 11 of us who were present that day. We were given the seats that has panoramic view of Sentosa. The sun rays directed to us and one of the attentive staffs asked me whether I would like to lower the blinds down as I was the first to arrive.After being ushered to the table, I headed to the restroom, located at the back of the restaurant. It was not as bright as I would like it to be and the toilets are pretty narrow and not much space to put our belongings. The one thing that fascinated me was not the mirrors towards the toilet but the sink. It was electronically sensored so you will have to use one hand to wave on the sensor while the water trickled down like waterfall. Service wise it was pretty inconsistent. Sometimes it might take awhile before the staffs come over to check on your needs.Food wise, one of my friends ordered.1) Har Gau (prawn dumpling) - was not warm enough. 2) Sweet corn pancake - did not taste it 3) Panfried radish cake with XO sauce - was alright 4) Prawn toast - highly recommended. The batter they use to get the dish made it crunchy and addictive 5) Crispy Mango Prawn Salad Roll with wasabi mayo - unfortunately I was not a fan of it even though it was Chinese fritters with prawn inside.6) Radish pancake - pretty good. It had quite a number of ingredients and made the dish to be collectively crunchy7) Prawn and beancurd skin rice roll - pretty interesting fusion dish. The beancurd skin was like those that are available for sushi. And flavor definitely popped out upon munching8) Signature custard lava bun - did not try it as it is a common dish at most restaurants that offer dim sum. (Took pretty long time before being served. Had to remind the staffs at least twice)Overall, food was alright.Prices wise it was considered reasonable especially located in one of the tourist must-go spots. Do check with the staff on the portion of the dishes.We were also served with the deep-fried fish skins and sesame with probably honey coated walnuts (if I didn't remember wrongly). Will probably try out their volcano black pepper bun and their signature custard buns during my next trip here.Thing to take note of that are chargeable here: wet napkins and glasses of water. And do check whether they discounted the prices of the dishes for the high-tea promotion (Monday to Saturday: 2.30pm to 5.30pm).",

It's a good thing Tim Ho Wan has come to town and opened up a dozen or more stores to alleviate this reality. Enter Black Society Restaurant, formerly called Bosses Restaurant. This restaurant serves the high-quality dim sum that Hong Kong is so well known for. No none of that late night Dim Sum that we so often see in Geylang that are touted / raved by locals. I mean very very high quality Dim Sum.I tried 5 dim sum dishes, which were all downright amazing.(i) Prosperity Bag Shumai (Crowd favourite) - Your regular shumai that we all know and love, but with a lot more \u00a0pizzas(ii) Traditional Char Siu Bun - Your regular Char Siu Bun, but this was by far the best one I've tried in Singapore -- far tastier than one you would normally taste at street vendors or Uncle Dim Sum establishments(iii) Snow Mountain Black Pepper Beef Bun (Crowd Favourite) - In my opinion, very similiar to the Char Siu Bun with a nice white powdery touch. (iv) Prawn and Beancurd Skin Rice Roll ( Crowd Favourite) - Very crunchy and tasty. A must have to balance out any Dim Sum selection(v) Basket Steam Spare Ribs (Crowd Favourite) - Wow, wow, wow. I've never had spare ribs like that. The spare ribs had a little bit of kick, especially if you happen to bite into the chili In my opinion, five-stars because high-quality Dim Sum is such a rare find in Singapore. It's too bad it is locate all the way in VivoCity.",

    "text": "For full reviews and photos, visit my blog!I know that the famous Michelin Star dim sum Tim Ho Wan has arrived in town. But if you are unwilling to beat that looooooooooooong queue at Plaza Singapure, may i suggest another comfortable alternative- Bosses at Vivocity.While it may not be 1 star quality, prices are affordable, location is convenient, ambience isn't too shady and the dim sum are generally quite consistent. I was first introduced to it by a girlfriend because the 30% discount at tea time seemed quite appealing to us. Available from Mon to Sat from \u00a02.30pm to 5.30pm, this is a pretty good deal for what is usually priced at $4-6 per box of little bites. And we were not disappointed. I've eaten here a couple of times following that first visit and it satisfies this hungry tummy. \u00a0 \u00a0Appetizer of fried fish skin. I know it looks eeeky and all and i have always avoided this dish until my recent trip to Bosses. The auntie server convinced me that it's great with the sweet chili and well.. it didn't turn out as bad as i've imagined. It's just like keropok aka fish crackers. One of my usual orders at Bosses is their Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun or Liu Sha Bao. The skin of the steamed bun is soft and fluffy and the golden sauce inside was of the right level of saltiness and viscosity. There was also a light coconut perfume that i can never seem to place but anything goes as long as it's tasty. This is one of the better ones around in Singapore.Fat juicy and flavorful prawns in my Har Gow. I would like the prawns to be a little bouncier but i wouldn't say that the mix is too powdery. My twin's seafood/prawn craving was satisfied. The meat dumplings, Siew Mai, was also topped with pretty butterflied prawns. I love how the meat wasn't too minced up that they lose their chewiness. Very substantial unlike the regular steamed siew mais in lesser establishments. The meat was also well marinated and fragrant. If you happen to be shopping in Vivocity, Bosses is a good option for a late lunch or tea.",

In particular, the dim sum items are hot favorites as what is served at Bosses is probably more exquisite than what you commonly get outside. I highly recommend you to try the signature flowy custard buns, as well as the seafood congee (forgot the exact name of the dish). The ingredients used are fresh, and definitely very very tasty!What's more, it's got a pretty nice and relaxed atmosphere, contrary to its name. The staff are nice and attentive too, which gives the overall experience an A! The only downside is the cost. The things are slightly pricey, so be prepared to pay a little more.Worth it or not? Well, you can be the boss.",

Once you enter, you will feel how unique the decoration is. Their theme is black in colour. It gives me a very classy and secretive kind of feeling.I have heard many excellent reviews on their famous custard buns. Highly recommended by many of my colleagues. Hence, the first dish to start with will definitely be that. Once the custard buns arrive, I'm really excited like a little kid. Couldn't wait for the rush of custard that is going to flow out. It really did not disappoint me at all. Best custard buns I have ever tasted. Hands down!Next dish I would highly recommend is their signature seafood congee with abalone and prawns. The prawns are really fresh. You can really taste the sweetness and freshness of the seafood in the porridge. Plus, they include ikan bilis to the porridge, which add on saltiness to the porridge. Perfect!",

It isn't a traditional Chinese restaurant by any means and its decor informs you of just that when you walk in. The restaurant is washed in dark sleek tones, which is an uncommon yet modern choice.The wait staff are attentive and they check on your tea pot quite frequently, which is a sign of good service. We had a good view of the sea and further afield, Resorts World Sentosa and Universal Studios. If you are here for dinner, you might catch the nightly fireworks display, which is a bonus.Some highlights of our dinner were the aromatic crispy duck and the drunken prawns. These are must-tries not only for the flavor and texture but also for their presentation. I would return again, and this time for the dim sum.",

This Chinese restaurant gives a very mysterious feeling but once you step inside , you will feel that the deco and design is very modern and classy. Personally I like the lightings, giving it an extra point to the ambience.They are famous for their salted custard bun, eat it immediately when served! But beware of the salted custard that ooze out from the bun, it is really hot. I am sure you will ask for more , one is just not enough to satisfy. Another dish I would recommend is their abalone porridge. The porridge is cooked with rich abalone taste, you will find that they do not scrimp on the ingredients.Price might be on a high side but it is definitely a good place to hold celebration for family occasions or for the elderly as their cuisine is oriental.",
