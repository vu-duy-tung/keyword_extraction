The location in the National Museum is just wonderful. \u00a0There is a 3 course executive lunch for a mid range price. \u00a0Wine is available and the list looked very ample. We ordered club sodas since this was the middle of the day. \u00a0I called ahead for some vegan options and the chef did prepare 3 really excellent dishes for me. \u00a0 Portions are a bit on the small side at lunch, maybe different at dinner.

Very happy they had this as it's a rare find with most restaurants serving plain smoked salmon. \u00a0It was presented with a little too much condiments that detracted from the fish. Nonetheless the gravlax was rich and lovely textured.For mains we shared a saddle of lamb stuffed with chestnuts mushroom and pumpkin. They flamed it on site. Very tasty and a good dish. However the fat was not sufficiently rendered and the lamb could have been more tender. Still, a good dish.For dessert I had a fig carpaccio with blueberry and honey comb ice cream. This was very good. Not too sweet and very deep fig flavor flamed with grand marnier. Altogether a fine dinner at a decent price. Value for money but frankly not an epic meal. Great meal with the family or a first date.",

    "text": "The cuisine at Flutes is modern Australian, occasionally fused with a touch of Asian elements. Its elegant and sophisticated fare is reflected in the posh and swanky setting. That said, the vibe is relaxed, with nary a whiff of stuffy pretentiousness. We liked the service too, attentive but discreet, knowledgeable without being overbearing. We had:1) Queen Victoria's Green Pea Soup ($18): with a block of sockeye salmon mi cuit, creme fraiche to add creaminess, and lemon to lend a bright accent - loveliest green pea soup I've ever had. Velvety smooth, and amazingly complex, this, together with the next 3 mains, made it to the must-try list.2) Twice Cooked Spanish Suckling Piglet ($46): Skin had a satisfyingly crackling crunch, and the flesh was lusciously fork-tender. This was contrasted with a dollop of caramelised apple compote, toasted grains, radish, and cup of sherry jus.3) Chilli Crab Pasta ($38): with oodles of freshly shredded king crabmeat weaved into a roll of angel hair, and crowned with a gargantuan crab leg, was subtly spiced, redolent of crab essence, was fantastic. 4) Pan Roasted Fillet of Barramundi ($42): incredibly crisp skin and moist flaky meat. This was set on a mashed potato bed, and served with rainbow heirloom tomatoes, rocket leaves, and a drizzling of olive emulsion.5) Grilled Margaret River Wagyu Striploin ($120 500gm for 2 to share): done to a medium-rareness as requested, and sided by a crisp peppery watercress salad and red wine jus - the only weak link of dinner. We didn't like the meat, which we thought too full bodied and this was quite forgettable.We opted for the accompanying sides of a beautifully caramelised casserole of Sweet Potato Dauphinoise ($12 ala carte price but complimentary with the striploin) and Roasted Broccoli ($12 ala carte price) sliced with a flavoursome sesame sauce and decadently plaited with smoked bacon lardons",

    "text": "I had dinner here during my last visit to Singapore a few months ago. I know there are a lot of food and dining options in Singapore, and for a much fairer price, but I was curious to explore other cuisines and restaurants that this wonderful city has to offer. I came here on a Monday evening for dinner, so as you can expect the place was almost completely empty. For those who have never been here, this restaurant is located within the National Gallery, but remains open until a later time.Since it was my first visit here, I was curious to try out their options, and so I decided to get the Chef's Table ($98 SGD) along with the wine pairing ($70 SGD). Some focaccia bread with an olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip were served in the beginning before anything else came out. It tasted simple, and was quite good to nibble on before the main items of our meal came out.The first part of the menu consisted of beef carpaccio and was topped with truffle flakes, cheese, potato crisps, and I think a creme fresh. It was all very tasty, and the flavors mixed appropriately. The truffles were a nice touch as well and didn't take away from the rest of the flavors of the course. The second course was foie gras, and this was perhaps my least favorite course of the entire meal. I may just be biased because foie gras (though a delicacy) just isn't one of my favorite things to eat, and the texture of it is just weird to me. It was prepared elegantly, and served with little bread toasts though, so they tried to make it work, but it just was not for me. It had a very buttery and fatty taste to it, so those who enjoy foie gras may like how it is prepared here. I'm not an expert because it is usually something I avoid, but since it came with the menu, I just tasted it anyways.A sorbet to cleanse the pallet was served before the third course. I had an option to choose from a seared beef tenderloin or the salmon fillet...ultimately, I opted for the beef tenderloin. This was probably my favorite course of the meal. The meat was cooked to a nice medium rare, and was tender and flavorful to the bite. The outside was cooked nicely, but the inside was a beautiful and juicy red. The gravy that topped it added good flavor, and wasn't too overpowering or anything. The accompanying vegetables also gave the course a nice touch.A citrus cheesecake was served for the final dessert course. I am usually not a big fan of cheesecake because I just don't like how heavy it feels and I dislike the creaminess of it. However, I would make an exception for the one that they prepare here. It was a small, but \"just right\" portion so I wasn't left nauseated when I finished it. The citrus flavor really helped to also make the dessert feel light and refreshing instead of too heavy and unpleasant. If it were up to me, it maybe wouldn't be my first choice of dessert, but the way it was prepared, I really can't complain.Overall, this is a decent place to visit for dinner and much different than your local Singaporean cuisine. The service was also fantastic, and very polite and attentive throughout the meal. However, I think that in my opinion, with regards to how much the meal was, and comparing it to other restaurants in the US, this restaurant really is just average. The food was good, but nothing was really a knock out, and there wasn't really anything that would make me want to come back here just for the food. I would probably just recommend this to people who would prefer a nicer and more upscale environment for an evening meal or to celebrate an occasion because the decor and atmosphere of the place is rather nice.",

    "text": "Flutes is not the easiest place to find - you have to locate the tiny little valet (look out for the standing sign), and if you miss it you'll have to drive all the way around fort canning to get back to it again, so consider taking a cab or public transport. Also ladies, I'd advise you to stay off heels because you have to climb a flight of stairs and walk across a paved driveway to get there. When you do get there however, it's a quiet little nook and rather quaint with the whole old colonial thing going on. I had a large group so I made reservations beforehand and they put us in a separate corner and customized a set lunch menu beforehand for my guests. Service there is top notch, the food also quite decent, but when they ask you for still or sparkling water, learn to say 'tap water' because 'still water' means they give you the fancy mineral sort and I ended up paying S$50 on water along. Seriously.",

    "text": "Did I enjoy my time in this restaurant? Immensely. Was it because of the food? Not quite. The menu is far from exciting, and the dishes are ultimately pleasant, but not memorable. That aside, everything else about Flutes is worth commending. The service is impeccable, and we were bowled over from the moment reservations were made over the phone. All aspects of our experience were handled with conviviality and a big pinch of charm. The wine list is also extensive and represented surprising value for money, and we enjoyed a great Sancerre along with our meal.Whilst you should not expect a culinary adventure, I certainly recommend Flutes for a date night. The restored black and white surrounded by fairy lights and vegetation offers a beautiful refuge in the middle of town. Locating the restaurant can be a bit of a challenge, so keep a look out for the lit sign indicating the entrance next to the Singapore Philatelic Museum. This leads into their carpark, and there is still a short walk before you get to the stairs leading to the restaurant.",

Tucked up behind the central fire station and next to the stamp museum, a narrow pathway leads you to a large flight of stairs that seem to go on forever. Though once at the top the climb is worth it. A colonial bungalow flutes at the fort charms with its black and white color scheme. The airy balcony and thick green growth hanging across the verandah make it hard to believe that your actual still in the center of bustling Singapore.Fantastic modern Australian food, the beef tenderloin was great, though the chocolate fondant here cannot and shouldn't be missed! Stunning warm rich chocolate with a gooey center gives yet another good reason to climb those flights of stairs. Service is always warm, informative and friendly. \u00a0Location, ambience, food and service make this a must place to dine, particularly if you're looking for a place to impress.",

The servers were super attentive, even to small details like filling up our water cups, and they went around the table to confirm our orders to prevent any mix-ups before the meal. The actual meal was pretty delicious as well. I had a green pea soup which was very tasty, and I loved it that it was a puree instead of a creamy version. I usually applaud chefs who go through the trouble of puree-ing, and they got the texture nice and smooth which is usually hard to do for peas. The fish we had was pretty good too. In general, the decor was super pretty, with high vaulted ceilings and white colonial pillars everywhere, with fresh flower arrangements. The food came on time, the night pretty much flowed seamlessly, and left a good impression on me. Will be back for a proper more intimate meal next time.",

Housed in a colonial black and white bungalow at Fort Canning Hill, the ambience is unlike any other restaurants (save Alkaff Mansion). The quality of the food and the preparation is unquestionable, however, I felt a little ripped off as the portions were quite miniscule in my opinion. Considering the amount I'm paying, I expect it to be maybe 30% bigger. That said, service was impeccable on both my visits and there was an improvement in the sizes, so management does take note of diners comments and are willing to change, which is always refreshing.",
