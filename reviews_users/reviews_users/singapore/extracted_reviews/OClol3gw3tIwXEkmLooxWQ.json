Try everything, most is some of the best you'll taste. Expect to pay $90 per person if you are hungry + thirsty.",

    "text": "It's telling that they are now only allowing people to book table (never mind trying to walk in) if they promise to buy some alcohol. The place has been packed every time I go. The best way to sum it up is this is affordable food for the Japanese taste, unadjusted for the local market. From deep fried oysters to ochazuke (oh, I crave that one weekly, and it's only $10), it's not your standard fare for an international Japanese restaurant. It reminds me of the times we used to pop into random izakayas in Tokyo (the more hidden the better) and ordered by pointing (Google Translate's photo function has alas taken some of the fun out of this). Although I am probably too inexperienced (40-60 bottles ever?) to judge, the sake seemed correct and decently priced for the country. It's a lovely place in my neighbourhood to take guests when we want something a bit more low key, to have a good chat over drinks. It really stands out for its atmosphere, despite the very Singaporean mall in which it is set. I think I'm going to go again tonight.",

Not only was I not handed a menu, but the waiter said 'you read this' \u00a0and rudely tapped on a sign that said the place did not welcome non-drinkers.That did not faze me, but the waiter said in a condescending tone, \"I don't think you drink, right? \" this was rude because I gave no indication about whether I drank. All of my friends are in our mid-twenties and do in fact, drink. I wonder if he would have given the same treatment to a group of similar aged guys. I clearly wasn't welcome and thus, did not eat there.",

    "text": "Food is great and affordable. And the stuff is different from your usual typical Japanese food \u00a0So it's a pity that the owner is such a jerk (I'd use other terms in this review if I could). He has a policy that everyone in the dining party has to drink (alcohol). Unfortunately, he does not clearly communicate this. When we made a reservation, he asked \"are you drinking?\" The person who made the reservation was going to drink, so he said yes -- not knowing that the owner meant \"is everyone in your party drinking?\"When we showed up, a couple of us (out of 5) ordered alcoholic drinks, and the others ordered tea. At no point did the waitresses who took out orders say anything about alcohol. Then the owner (aptly wearing a tshirt describing himself as a (k)\"nob\") came over and scowled and started basically scolding us for not ordering alcohol. We would've done so, except he turned around and walked off like the huffy spoilt jerk he was before we could place any order.We ultimately paid and left without finishing our food and drinks. When we tried to explain to him our position, he just tried to brush us off. If he was really so proud and principled, he wouldn't have taken out money -- but he did. Like the jerk he is. Ps. There was a sign in the restaurant saying that people who don't drink alcohol aren't welcome -- but again it does not explicitly say everyone present must drink.",

I think that's a ridiculous rule, especially if some diners don't drink. And it is a bald faced attempt to make money because margins are obviously higher for drinks. I come here for the food not the alcohol. And if you're going to ram alcohol down my throat then I'm taking my business elsewhere.",

    "text": "Tucked in an inconspicuous spot on the ground floor of an old building behind Bugis, I was honestly a bit shocked to find one of the most authentic izakaya in town on my first visit to Nobu-ya. \u00a0The vibe is unpretentious with minimal decor, so you know food is their focus. It's always crowded to the brim (at least on all of my visits) so reservation is recommended. \u00a0And no, this is not your upscale, pretty, zen kaiseiki fine dining kind of place, it's more like a hole-in-the-wall establishment. At times, their tables spilled over to the \"roadside\" - the corridor inside the very run-down looking mall. \u00a0Understandably, you might be a bit skeptical but the sheer volume of native Japanese seems to be testimonial of its authenticity. \u00a0And the moment you sat down, take a sip of the sake and dig into that bowlful of octopus tentacles full of umami goodness you get teleported to the streets of Japan. \u00a0Menu seems constantly updated and items come in small plates for sharing. \u00a0Just pick whatever looks good or just pick everything, the good thing about small plates is that you can have a good selection. \u00a0On my first visit when my friend took me there, he told me about the \"rule\" that to get a seat you need to order alcohol. \u00a0Understandably that causes some distress in people who don't drink but to be fair it is an izakaya which is literally a place for drinks so make some alcoholic friends!",

But last Sat is \"the worst\"experience to me, I am 9 month pregnant now and my friends invite me to here hv dinner & drink. When I just sit down not even 30 Sec and the owner\" Nobuya San\" ran to our table and shouting at me and said\" we don't welcome pregnant lady becoz she won't buy any drinks and pls no more pregnant friends here in the future\"! Very very rude and I don't know who tell him I can't hv a drink or buy drinks for myself. His attitude has problem and I can't no longer enjoy the food any more.! I travel to JP many time and hv try all different JP restaurant in all Asia countries but Never Never see such arrogant owner before. Be honest his food is so so just a bit cheap in SG but not even better than small JP restaurant in China... So me & my hubby will not go again",
