    "text": "This is my first visit after hearing about it for several years. We had the fish soup (2 small sized bowls instead of 1 medium sized on the advice of a waitress because it's cheaper), fried tofu, prawn paste chicken and sambal kangkong for 3 persons which totalled about $21 per person. The fish soup was the milky looking kind and it was delicious! The fish unfortunately, though fresh without tasting fishy, wasn't outstanding considering the fish soup is the specialty dish. The rice was of terrible quality so you're better off ordering the vermicelli. The tofu and chicken were perfectly fried to a crisp while remaining moist.Food was decent but not fantastic enough to make a pressing case to return for more.",

Old favourites like the fish slice bee hoon soup, prawn paste chicken are still on the menu today. Old yellowing photographs line the walls showing all the celebrities who visited in the past. I came for lunch with my father and ordered the fish slice bee hoon soup, sam lo hor fun and the prawn paste chicken. The chicken is still crisp and flavourful but the famous fish soup was disappointing. Not only was the soup not the rich taste I remember but it had a heavy fishy taste which should not be the case if really fresh fish was used.",

    "text": "This is probably a 3.5 stars place.Ka-Soh has been around for years and is well known for its fish bee hoon soup. Being an old establishment along Amoy Street, don't expect a spiffy decor or a modern looking restaurant. Here you get the traditional old school style of what eatery looks like in the 1980s or maybe even earlier. Besides fish bee hoon soup, they also serve other zi char dishes so it is a good place to dine as a group. I was alone that night after gym and wanted a quick meal. I ordered slice fish bee hoon soup and prawn paste fried chicken (har cheong kai). The soup was not as tasty as before and the small saucer of lard was eye popping. I forgot about the lard. The dish had a generous serving of thick fish slices which made the higher price (compared to coffee shop or hawker center) worth it. The best dish was still the har cheong kai which was crispy and juicy and delicious. I think I prefer the other outlet near Singapore General Hospital.",

    "text": "We got excited when we realized it was the same Ka-Soh that hailed from Malaysia, which my wife had been frequenting for years. Naturally we ordered the special sliced fish noodle soup, since it's what this place is famous for. After one spoonful of the soup however, I couldn't drink any more. It had such an overpowering fishy stench that it was like licking a salmon. And not a fresh one at that. \u00a0I had to lift out the vermicelli and eat that separately - and grudgingly, to avoid going home hungry. The fish itself tasted fine, but still had bones in the \"fillets\"!!Terrible food and not worth the name / reputation.",

I suggest ordering only one noodle dish (their seafood hor fun, shen mian or Hk noodles), their fried Tofu, one pork ribs, one fish soup and rice! That would make for a really good evening meal!",
