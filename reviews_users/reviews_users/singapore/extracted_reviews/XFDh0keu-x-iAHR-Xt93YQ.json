Certainly not the best curry since it's a bit fast-food-ish but still a very good choice. Personal favorite is the Tonkatsu curry. I would recommend going for this classic dish since I'ts the best combo with Japanese curry. Have tried the salmon and shrimp curries as well - which are also good but just don't go as well compared to the Tonkatsu",

I like their omelette too but this time, I chose their croquette curry set. But their rice isn't quite enough for me though. Their rice are only half of the plate size. But thumbs up for their curry! Always my love. Will be trying out the other set next time.",

    "text": "The Pancake Wave in Japan at might be the motivation behind the launch of pancakes at the Westgate outlet and it is the first overseas outlet to do so. (You can't find pancakes in any Japan outlets either). But pioneering new items are attached with great risks. Outlook were not very optimistic for the pancakes, which had a common problem of being too weighty, dense and chewy. Portion size is good for desserts but the whipped cream wilted badly at the mercy of the heat emitted from those fresh-of-the-griddles batter. There are currently four variants - Caramel Nutty Pancake, Banana Choco Pancake, Rainbow Fruity Pancake, and Happy Berry Pancake. So perhaps it may be good to practice some patience and await a better batch of 2nd-generation pancakes as the recipe undergoes a revamp. In the meantime, keep calm and try some of the unique curry that meets the local tastebuds. How can Japanese curry be so spicy that it sets off a burning sensation on the tongue? Yes, chilli heads will be delighted to know that one can get some kick-ass curry at Coco Ichibanya, if you order the highest level 5. I took up the challenge to have a taste and it approximates close to our punchy Southeast Asian Sambal. \u00a0But for those who love the classically sweet Japanese curry, go for level 0.Instead of going for the recommended items such as Creamy Mushroom Omu or Pork Cutlet Cheese, we placed our bets on the Salmon Croquette with Mushroom Curry($15)-level 2. The mildly-spiced gravy made up for the flatly mediocre salmon croquettes, which came with tiny salmon cubes. The idea of customizing your curry level apply to all except for the Omelette rice series. The Pork Cutlet Omelette Curry Rice ($15) with a maximum spice level 3, had a less-than-runny omelette. The breaded Pork Cutlet was crunchy coupled with curry of a faint, fugitive heat.These curry rice meals don't encourage you take petit bites, they exhort you to dig in. Interestingly, the curry here is made with 17 different spices! I was quite impressed by the spiciness of their curry and now I am contemplating to take-away some of the level 4 gravy to go with some fragrant roti-bun next time!",

    "text": "Came across this place for a bit especially when it is located at orchard. It was normally packed but I was fortunate enough to be seated straightaway on a Tuesday night. While looking at the menu, the price seems decent considering it is located at the central where tourists might pass by when they are shopping for goods.What attracted while browsing the menu was the pork cutlet curry. While ordering, the waiter even told us what's cheaper or what's not - set or separate dishes. He also asked about how much rice I wanted as well as the level of spiciness.Curry wise it is comparable to the curry house restaurants in Southern California. But Katsu wise I just like the breaded flour. Rice wise it is considered good for that price.Food wise - 3 stars and adding the other star for customer service especially for the waiter named Jun Jie. Will come back again for the curry but might be ordering shredded beef ones instead. Bon appetit!!",

Prices start from $14 onwards for a simple katsu curry and goes slightly more expensive for dishes with omu (omelette) and beef. What's better is that each add-on is clearly stated in the menu and the prices are clearly shown. Normally I would ask for some extra rice (a bit pricey for rice, but it is absolutely required when taking on the spicy challenge).The curry is thick and consistent but the katsu is quite small in size. But really, that katsu is not the star. The curry is and it is absolutely great in terms of spiciness.Be warned that level 3 onward is really spicy and one should proceed with caution.",

No wonder the popularity of the Japanese curry has also spread here. Currently, there are two Japanese curry joints that opened in Singapore and one of them is Coco Ichibanya. The one at the Somerset is the first outlet and has got me hooked since then! You can make your customize your curry rice, whether you want less rice or more rice, the side dish/topping to go along with it, and even the spiciness (mild to level 5). The main, which is the curry, is really creamy and goes well with the rice, no matter which level you choose. There's a common misconception that Japanese curry is not spicy, which is not true. Personally, level 2 is already quite spicy. So if you want your curry more spicy, you can just go up the level!
