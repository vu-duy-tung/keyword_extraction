    "text": "Prego has been a stalwart on the Italian mid/fine dining scene for ages, and it's no surprise. The food is consistently good, and the menu refreshed frequently enough to keep even long time regulars coming back for more.The service is also genuine and efficient, which helps a lot. Located in the Fairmont Hotel, one is greeted with the happy sight of a deli with cured meats and cheeses. The dining area is a large but still intimate place with the right amount of everything, such that it would be equally good for a romantic casual date in the evening, and very fitting as well for a serious business lunch on week days.The choices offered in the two daily lunch sets are spot on: a quick panini + soup/salad set, or a more hearty three course chef's menu that hits the spot if you're a little hungrier.",

The food and selection was above average for buffet standards, and had every ethnic cuisine known around Singapore, as well as some western items. Pretty much everything I tried was well-made.The layout is very confusing. It's in two divisions and you have to walk ~80ft to get to the other side to see what's there. The service is what really annoyed me. During a late breakfast, the whole service crew aggressively turns over the front of house for lunch. They were slamming glasses, chairs, plates, silverware, etc like as if they were on a time limit. By doing that, it pretty much tells the patrons to \"get out\", it's terribly loud and doesn't make for a relaxing breakfast. At the higher price of this place, you'd expect much better than that. I recommend Gastronomia Di Paolo or Tiong Bahru down the escalator instead.",

    "text": "The thing about Prego or any of the restaurants in Fairmont or Swissotel the Stamford is that the chef is only there for 2 years? Apparently they rotate the head chefs among their hotels worldwide to refresh the menu. But the staple or favorite dishes will remain. I was back there last night and discovered the new chef came in 3 months ago and the menu has been tweaked slightly. So certain items which my friend raved about were no longer there. So do go back often if you like a particular dish as it may not be around a few years later. My favorite dishes are a white pizza and cannolo dessert from a few years ago. I am hoping they will bring that back again. The white pizza was simply brushed with olive oil and herbs and topped with parma ham, mushrooms and cheese. So simple and so good. The cannolo was filled with sweet cream and served with a scoop of ice cream and fruits. Again the simplicity just blew me away. Back to the current menu, it was also very good. I am glad the \"family style\" concept of the previous chef is gone. I stopped going for a while as I found the dishes too hearty. A whole roast chicken? But they retained the antipasti spread which is nice. Based on past experiences, we found the food can be a bit too rich so we decided to share the dishes. It was a good thing too as we still could not finish our dishes. The pumpkin and mushroom risotto looked plain but it was full of flavor and was also cheesy. The fusili had plenty of real crab meat (in chunks so you do not have to search for it) and asparagus and was also a bit jelak (too rich) after a while. The only white pizza on the menu now had a cream base so it was not what I had in mind. We decided to get the Italiana which had buffalo mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes (very sweet and juicy) and arugula on it. This was equally delicious though I wished there were more of the mozzarella on it. Dessert was not as good compared to the mains. Maybe we should have stuck to gelato and tiramisu instead. The tiramisu is always good here. If you cannot decide what to have, the set dinner option is a good deal at $69 and it generally have pretty good dishes. I do think the prices are a bit on the high side, and it makes me wonder if it is catered to the FAR/AMEX card members where they can get discount of up to 50% (depending on number of diners).",

It consisted of 7 pieces of sliced octopus the size of a US quarter coin and 4 cubes of sweet potato on a dry bed of shaved fennel, probably days old because it was tasteless and bone dry. The menu says it would come with Salsa Verde but the whole dish was dry and flavorless. I couldn't take a photo of the dish when it arrived because I felt it would have been offensive to my host--there was obviously nothing to warrant a photo. Nor a return visit.",

This place serves fresh food (oh I'm an absolute lover for fresh ingredients!). Set dinner comes with a \"chef hat only\" anti pasti + \"chef hat only\" pasta + chef daily special + dessert. \"Chef hat only\" cuz you can only select the items with the chef hat logo.We ordered a dinner set, and added on an anti pasti of foie gras and a pizza for 3 to share. We've got aged parma ham for anti pasti selection, a linguini (small serving size was served instead of its normal serving size for set dinner), and a tiramisu. Chef daily special was beef stew with carrots and roasted potatoes. As usual for an Italian dining, bread was served for appetizer with home made truffle butter! The truffle butter was delicious! Olive oil served upon request only.Aged parma ham was served with rock melon and it rocked. We were pretty surprised with the serving size of the linguini though, as it looked like a $5 pasta when served. Really.....Roasted foie gras and pizza (Rustica) was really nice and we totally enjoyed it.Dinner ended with a coffee, tea and tiramisu, and our night feels complete!Waiters are rather attentive to us at all times, despite the huge restaurant space they occupy! However, our orders for coffee and tea were forgotten twice and we gotta remind them.Spent about $$$$/$$$$$ and felt that it was worth it. We spent a great 2 hours quality time together enjoying great food!Till next visit!",

If you're someone who enjoys tasting sweet and salty in one dish, Prosciutto di Pa Parma is for you. The sweet Rock Melon pairs well with the Parma Ham, leaving a clean aftertaste. The beef in Carpaccio di Manzo is thinly sliced and melts in your mouth, allowing you to fully enjoy the well seasoned dish. The mushrooms on Funghi Misti pizza were juicy and fragrant; the thin base and crust helped enhance the taste. Though it was delicious, the pizza seemed a bit overpriced. \u00a0The chicken in Pollo Arrosto were well roasted while maintaining its tenderness. It was also well accompanied by an array of grilled vegetables, making it a nutritious meal!

Not too creamy, strong mushroom taste, smooth and not too heavy. The ravioli is deserving of mention too. However, the portion is a tad small, but that is pretty normal of ravioli orders.The braised lamb shank is usually beautifully cooked. Tender and juicy. Mm.Definitely leave some space for their signature Tiramisu. The $14 price tag doesnt come cheap, but it is well worth the price tag!If you have an Amex platinum card with the free far card gourmet membership, the discount is 50% for 2 diners, 33% for 3 diners, 25% for four diners and 20% for five diners and above. Pretty decent prices after the discount if you ask me!",

    "text": "Went for Prego's Sunday Brunch with my family twice and I must say I love it to bits because of the buffet selection! Prego's brunch buffet changes depending on what they have during that season. The first time we went there, they were offering a selection of fresh fruit juice, foie gras and scallops as part of their buffet. Another time we went there, they had a breakfast selection of eggs benedict, scramble eggs and you can order fruits smoothie made fresh from the kitchen from your waitress (it is part of the buffet). The only things that remained unchanged were the cold cuts section which served parma ham, salami, capicola etc. There's also a nice selection of cheese and crackers next to the cold cuts. The salad section was fairly generous. I loved their salmon salad. They have a roast section where there's duck, beef cheeks, braised ox tail, pan grilled salmon, breaded calami rings etc. They have a seafood section where there's oysters, scallops, prawns and mussels. Of course, being an italian restaurant, they have a chef there to cook the pasta of your choice fresh for you. It's a family oriented restaurant where there's a children's section near the roast food section for kids to play, run around and eat at. The highlight of this place for me was their dessert section. Tiramisu, apple fritters fried before your eyes then sprinkled with brown sugar and caramel sauce served onto your plate warm, a mountain of chocolate profiteroles, chocolate mousse, vodka and wine jelly shots, \u00a0biscotti, ice cream, cheesecake, panna cotta, flan.. oh you name it, they have it. It's desserts heaven for a desserts lover like me. Prego's Sunday Brunch also offers champagne but it comes with an added cost to your total bill. The service was great as well. It is definitely worth a try if you are looking for a filling Sunday Brunch.",

Since there are so many great and interesting places to eat for lunch and dinner, I only go here for breakfast. It is very enjoyable, with a huge selection, from continental European to traditional English to Asian and Indian specialties. Services is good, food is excellent, and it's easy to get in and out quickly. I did try for dinner twice and found it to be good, if unspectacular.",

As we walked, I noticed how homey and done up the place looked. The service was spot on, with the staff greeting us at the entrance with enthusiasm and smiles. We were ushered to a nice table, and the waitress, pushed a wine cart to our table and served us wine immediately! Was like she read our minds! Hahah. We got a meat & cheese platter and a salad, which was yummmy.What I Love: Service was amazing. The menu was cool and I loved the meat and cheese platter they served. Wine was great. Ambiance was perfect. It's romantic, nice and has a nice vibe.What I Don't Love: Price. What we had came up to $130ish? But with a MasterCard, there was a 20% discount - which was amazing. Brought the bill down a bit. Do prepare to spend $50-$80 pax.",

The pricing is a bit off the chart I find but this might have to do with the fact that it belongs to the hotel.Parking is obviously easy as it's connected to Raffles City mall, alternatively if you use MRT go to City Hall station.Another thing this has has going for itself is the decor and lighting. It makes me really comfortable for some reason, like a market style. It's fun!Enjoy peeps!-S :)",

To top that, City Hall MRT is right next door that it's convenient to come here. And after, check out New Asia Bar at Swiss Hotel next door.",
