    "text": "Culina is fresh European bistro food served in a clean, white, and cozy space.The oysters were full and fresh.The burrata smooth and creamy.Charcuterie salty, smooth, and rich.Everything was cooked in a way that brought out its natural flavors.The fish and chips was so simple yet delicious. The mussels and rack of lamb were also cooked and seasoned just right. (The lamb came with a side of roasted tomatoes and peppers that literally melted in your mouth. I'm still confused how they made that happen.)The place was buzzing for Sunday afternoon lunch. Salads and sandwiches are $20+. Mains $30+. Certainly not cheap, but eating here reminded me WHY food can cost this much in the first place - you're paying for a meal that you enjoy in the simplest and fullest understanding of the word.The deli made for a fun wander-through as you waited for your food, though it felt a bit small - probably to make room for the dining space. The place was chock full of wonderful, wondrous imported gourmet things. If I ever run into anyone seeking a thoughtful gift - I'll direct the kind soul to Culina.",

    "text": "Had lunch there today. Very busy even though we came quite late around 2 pm. I sampled the steak. Was nice and juicy although the gravy served in the side lacked personality and tasted like something made out of \"fond de veau de cantine\".The lentils salad was nice except the bottom of the plate that was watery. Not a great finale after a good start.The grilled chicken tasted nice. The sauce made up for the pale looking chicken with a couple brown stripes.The croque monsieur was decent. Above average and good cheese.The gratin dauphinois was okay maybe a but dry and the dish was too deep in my humble opinion.Overall I would say it was a nice European experience and some classic French staple food executed pretty well, attention to details would improve the experience and justify the steep bill.",

    "text": "I really liked their steak here. But, a little pricey for just a steak. However, the burnt sections of the steak where they grill it tastes very good for some reason, it's like they grilled it on cedar wood or some sort of wood that makes it have that smokey taste.We paired this steak with Chilean wine. So they sell wine in the supermarket, but they charge you corkage if you buy from the supermarket. If you buy from the menu, no corkage. Weird right?And the cheese is good - they have a variety of cheese.Dessert we shared sticky toffee pudding and apple pie - both were good too.I would recommend coming here if you can get reservations. It's a nice place to have dinner, indoors, because I can't stand the weather in Singapore...",

    "text": "This place has a novel concept where deli and restaurant merge as one. Culina produces reasonably good quality food. A recent change in chef has meant we miss some of the ways some dishes are prepared but still, we think this place is great to sit, people watch while enjoying steak, pasta or the like which are all cooked well.What disappointed me and caused me to score it one star is the service. While Culina has the basics and generally their floor staff cannot be faulted, they clearly lack a competent sommelier and an empowered assistant manager. For a place that serves wine, it is intolerable to not have someone who can provide sound advice on wine on their standard list and the wine in their deli section. It is also intolerable to not have someone who understands customer relationship management and to make the executive decisions in this space when a customer is complaining about a legitimate issue.Last night, we ordered our regular favorite bottle of wine from their store which we paid corkage for on top of the deli pricing. On tasting, it was badly heat damaged. We raised the concern and the assistant manager decided to stand firm and insisted it was not heat damaged. She pushed the fact that the whole batch has been sitting here and there is nothing wrong with it.I won't pretend to assume I am an expert but in my 20 years, I know when wine is heat damaged or not. We have had this same bottle of wine on many occasions here in Culina prior to last night. Same year. Same vintage. It WAS perfect.She offered to decant and we eventually opened a second bottle. Also heat damaged. In the end, we paid for the bottle but hardly touched the wine still sitting in the decanter and the first glass she poured it in. She never offered any form of apology or suggested to replace the wine with another vintage despite this.This place used to be a staple for us for steak and wine. It is now off the list until someone informs us a competent sommelier is in place. Or a competent manager. Preferably both.",

I heard from a very upset friend that they apparently have a corkage charge if wine is consumed on the premises. I usually just blindly pay my bill, but could you say way to capitalize much?Besides from that my personal experience aside, I've only heard good things about this restaurant. It's a fantastic place for a Sunday lunch, or a lunch anytime at all. Great place to sit down with you buddies for some quality bonding. Generally I am very happy with this restaurant.

    "text": "This review is solely for the boutique/grocery.I was excited to visit this place, as I love to cook Italian food and I can never seem to find quality ingredients for Italian cooking at my nearby grocery stores.They had a good selection of balsamic vinegars and olive oils, and they range from affordable to ridiculously high end. I didn't see any bottled tomato sauce, which surprised me. (I guess I'll head across the street to Jones the Grocer for that, as they have a nice selection there.) Their produce and bread selection is small, but everything looked fresh. It seems they put more of a focus on their wines and their butchery.I guess I had my hopes a bit too high, as I felt the store overall was lacking. I think it's because it's in a small space, and it's simply a \"gourmet\" grocer - gourmet in a VERY broad sense, as it doesn't focus on a specific cuisine. Still, I lust after their high end stuff and once I start working, I might treat myself to a few items from here. :) I don't think this will be my go-to spot for fancy shmancy shenanigans, but if I'm in the area wouldn't hesitate to drop by.",

Fantastic products from all around the world, a great selection of beef, mainly from Australia and New Zealand, they also sell dry aged beef, which I can't think of anyone else in Singapore who is selling this incredible product, worth every cent!! Amazing fresh air flown vegetables, from France, Holland and Australia, will inspire anyone looking at whipping up a fantastic dinner. Their customer service team is awesome, product knowledge is very astute and they are always very friendly and helpful. Add a bistro with great food and you'll find yourself grabbing a basket full of goodies for the kitchen at home, and sitting down for lunch! Steak sandwich and croque monsuire are both very very good, simple dishes executed well with great produce. \u00a0Will and always will be a regular customer of this store.",

They were fresh, big, sweet and amazing. Topped with the Tetsuya sauce which was like a miracle sauce for oysters, these oysters are unparalleled. Their homemade gnocchi with duck ragout was an excellent dish as well. Everything I had here was pretty tasty, except the spaghetti with crabmeat. Crabmeat was clumpy and soft and the pasta was overcooked. For a complete review on it, visit my blog (address under my profile). Thanks!",

There is a great choice of wines from different countries (no Alsace found though), exclusive vegetables (the small artichokes looked delicious), French type bread and cheeses.The restaurant was completely full \u00a0but that is typical here for a Sunday at lunch time. I had a fris\u00e9e with vinaigrette,croutons and baked fat lard with a poached egg, and the only comment I can give is that it was too much fris\u00e9e (a curly slightly bitter salad, not sure how that translates).I saw my neighbor had salmon trout on a risotto that looked good as well. Definitely a nice place for brunch on a sunny Sunday. Friendly service (no service charge).",
