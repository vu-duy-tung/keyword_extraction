Very clean and so good to have a place with an included toilet facility so we don't need to walk outside or around. Food and coffee was okay. The berry bliss was nice. Would reorder that again when looking for something refreshing and light. It was served in a coconut shell which was different and the ice was very well blended so must be a good gadget making it so smooth. Coffee was satisfactory. Glad we tried it but next time I'd be eager to see what else is down the road.",

I definitely recommend this place for a quick, good, western breakfast or coffee.",

Maybe I should have ordered coffee.",

The staff brings you a menu but you would have to make your way to the counter to place your order. We got the iced latte which they call \"ice white\" $5.50, a iced chocolate $5.50 and a iced lychee mint tea $6.50. The coffee was strong but I felt lacked depth. The other non coffee drinks were lovely though. My friend got a brunch plate of avocado toast topped with 2 poached eggs. Competently done for only $8.50! Where to find? OOT but I love their crockery! It's so organic looking :)Note: cash only; no GST. Will be back!",

Will have to come back and try some, and also check out their specialty coffee drinks. Right outside the Novena MRT station exit (United Square exit).",
