The pizza is quite tasty with thin crust. The meatball is just ok but the sauce certainly helps. \u00a0The pasta needs more seasoning and bigger portion for the price they charged us. \u00a0They charges the water. I won't be coming back again.",

Not impressed.The pizzas couldn't be smaller and they could not be stingier with the ingredients. The Meatball pizza came with 5 tiny pieces of some sort of meat concoction at $23!!!Horrible place... and the manager? Nowhere to be found on a Saturday afternoon... and it shows! Spend your $$$ somewhere else!",

The pastas were cooked perfectly \"el dente\" except it was too salty. The fact that all the pasta dishes came out salty makes me suspect that maybe the pasta water was heavily salted as well as the chef having heavy hands when seasoning the food. Fix the over seasoning issue and the food should actually be quite good.",

Then they have the audacity to say they will charge us for Singapore tap water per person. \u00a0First time we were there they didn't seem to charge for a simple galas on tap water. We left just on principle only. \u00a0There are a number other pizza places around that treat their customers much better.",

    "text": "Originally from Brooklyn, I was very excited to see Motorino arrive in Singapore, as it doesn't hurt to have another fine pizza joint. \u00a0And in terms of the pies, Motorino definitely delivers, but there are a few other parts of the dining experience that could be better. \u00a0The actual pie is 12 inches so it's good for one hungry person. \u00a0The crust is definitely amazing, and I really enjoyed the quality of ingredients. \u00a0It's a bit different from Mozza in the sense that there is more sauce, and I really enjoyed my version with sweet sausage, mozarella, and mushrooms. \u00a0What could be better? \u00a0For starters, it's very warm inside. \u00a0Even warmer than outside. \u00a0I know there is a massive oven inside, but still, it's quite uncomfortable (tip: there is a fan by one table which is where I would sit). \u00a0Secondly, it's next to the Butcher Club which apparently has a live DJ (at least on the Saturday night), so it was quite loud...not as loud as Attica, but it would be difficult to carry on a conversation. \u00a0So overall, while Motorino has some fine pies, I found it not very comfortable in terms of a restaurant.",

We used to eat at Motorino \u00a0fairly regularly. I've also eaten at an abundance of pizza places in Italy from childhood through to an adult with relatives. \u00a0We finally found the time to go to Motorino Singapore last night and I can report they have exactly replicated their downtown NYC location with excellent Neapolitan pizzas made with the best and freshest ingredients in a proper wood burning oven by a skilled pizzaiolo. \u00a0Clark Quay is not were I would think to go for a top quality meal out most nights, but if you want a real pizza in Singapore this is right at or near the top of the short list of places to go.",
