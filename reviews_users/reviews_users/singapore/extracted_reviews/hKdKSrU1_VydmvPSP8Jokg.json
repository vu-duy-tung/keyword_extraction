My nieces and aunt brought me to this restaurant to enjoy dinner. We ordered via iPad. I was amazed by how the trains delivered our orders from the kitchen.I loved the veggie tempura. The sweet scallops were very tasty. My aunt enjoyed the chawanmushi or steamed egg with seafood. My niece enjoyed her fusion sushi: duck breast nigiri and fried chicken nigiri. Interestingly delicious! How about those crunchy deep fried squid or calamari tentacles. We also had a creamy ebiko mayo nigiri.It was a fun evening for all!",

    "text": "Pretty creative alternate 'conveyor-belt' sushi. You order all your food via a menu on an iPad and pretty soon afterwards, a rocket boat zooms over with your order served on it. You can order anything from rice bowls to appetizers to sushi to drinks and they all come on this electric boat. Pretty fun to see.Chirashi-don for S$9.50 was the most worth it. It came with some pretty creamy shrimp and salmon, and I like my shrimp creamy. Unfortunately the yellowtail was quite tough and inedible though and the salmon roe was even a bit \"wilted\" and old. The chawanmushi was very disappointing, but at least it only cost S$2.30. The egg wasn't very smooth and there were air bubbles all throughout. The mushroom also left a black stain on the top of the egg, which wasn't very appetizing. The Genki Roll was okay, but they didn't use the top grade salmon to make it; the salmon was a bit older and noticeably more stale. S$1.50 for free flow matcha powder green tea worth it. Sure, it's usually free in Japan, but it's acceptable for Singapore. Cute concept; great for a quick, affordable, no-fuss meal. \"Bar-like\" seating makes it good for singles or small groups.",

The robotic train does provide some entertainment value that is what delivers you're feeling OK however that means that the dishes clean up and servers have no people skills and started picking-up empty plates right in front of me eating as I was eating on the plates in fact! \u00a0To the point that I had to tell them to come back in two minutes. Moreover even before 10 o'clock they started dimming the lights yet half the dining room was still seated. Overall if you want really quick ok quality sushi then this would be an ok place - but if you are looking for a meal then I suggest you stay away...",

On top of that, it wasn't too busy, so we decided to rest our legs and eat some sushi. While Genki is known for its conveyor belt, this particular location solely operate by \"train.\" There's an iPad where you order and everything comes out very quickly! I like this method better, since the food is fresh and fried items are hot as opposed to it being cold when it's circling around the belt. The downside is it can get expensive. The three of us spent over $50. A set lunch menu at the restaurants around this area is about $10-$15, but I did enjoy everything, so I suppose it was worth it!",

    "text": "The Come Back Kid I remember the days that Genki Sushi were at Forum Shopping Mall. Can't quite remember but I do believe that they we're one of the very first to introduce us to the world of conveyor belt sushi. However, since re-opening it's doors, Genki Sushi has returned with a bang. They started garnering attention with their Sushi trains but take away the gimmick and what you're left with is a.... Pretty... Decent... Japanese restaurant. I have to admit..... I absolutely love their rice. As compared to some of their nearest rivals, they definitely have the upper hand. Chirashi Don At $9.80, this has to be one of the most reasonable Chirashi Don's available. With 2 slices of Salmon, 2 slices of Tuna, Swordfish, Egg, Shrimp and Ikura (salmon roe), it truly is a value for money. Salmon Sushi with Pollock Roe Sauce Definitely our favourite sushi here. The sweet vinegared rice, with its succulent salmon topped with the salty pollock roe sauce is a match made it heaven! Takoyaki. Since the original takopachi and Gindako started disappearing from our shores, I've found it progressively hard to find a good takoyaki in Singapore. Thankfully, genki's are pretty good and definitely helps when we're craving for it. Teriyaki Salmon. ($9.80) Another high note for us here. Although the cook tend to vary from restaurant to restaurant, we've noticed that all restaurants at least offer a very decently sized piece of salmon for its price. On a whole, if you're looking for a quick fix for jap food, and don't want to settle for some of the lesser restaurants, than Genki is the place to go. We really love the rice here and that is enough to jeep is coming back for more! Do take note though that they are VERY popular during periods so be ready to queue.",

It's rather cute that each table is the name of a different stop in Japan! This makes the food more hygienic and fresh, given that it is prepared upon order and has not been on the belt for rounds. Their green tea is also worth a mention-at $1.50, you get free flow green tea from green tea powder (not teabags). This means that you can decide the intensity of your drink. Would definitely reccomend their mentaiko salmon sushi-one of the first and best I've had to date. Simply melts in your mouth!",

    "text": "I used to frequent Genki Sushi many years ago when it had an outlet at Forum Shopping Mall. Then I stopped and I thought it has closed down in Singapore till I saw it again at Orchard Central. I was given a booth seat and it was assumed I knew how their system work. I was left to my own devices and I just explored and discovered customers were to order from the tablet placed above conveyor belt in the middle of the table. The tablet also contained the menu and bill. The fun or cool factor was the way food was delivered - via a train or plane or whatever you called it on the conveyor belt. Basically you browsed the menu either on the tablet or on the side of the conveyor belt (one is stuck there), tap on the food you wish to have. Confirm your order. Wait. The food will arrive via the train. Pick it up. Press the button above to send the empty train back to the kitchen. Tuck into your food.There is a hot water dispenser at your table so you can make our own green tea. Once you are done, look at the bill on the tablet and tap to request for it, then head to the cashier for payment. Basically you do not have to interact with the service staff much. Food wise, it is terribly mediocre. The chirashi don was the worst I ever had. The fish did not taste very fresh and the rice was awful. I actually did not finish it. The chawanmushi was not the best either. Maybe if you are used to Sakae Sushi standard, then it would seem ok. The best of the lot of what I ordered was the spicy salmon sushi. Maybe it was perfectly masked in the spicy sauce, so it actually tasted pretty good. I am disappointed with the quality of food as I had spent many happy times dining in Genki Sushi years ago and it was never this bad. Pricing is similar to other chain mass market sushi joint. \u00a0It is definitely not the place for sashimi, but kids will love the place, just to see the train zoom in and out, carrying plates of food to your table.",

The cute kiddy trains that deliver your sushi, and the iPad you use to order your sushi. (Novelty factor aside...)3.

Here in Singers, it's a totally different concept, and one that I greatly admire. Once you are seated, you are handed an IPAD where you place your order. Once you place your order, you sit back and enjoy your company, and in due time, a race car comes out on a belt and delivers your sushi orders. If you are there with kids, they'll get a kick out of ordering off an ipad and watching the race car drive by their table with food in hand. The food is fine for what it is, and we weren't expecting the best quality as this is more of a budget sushi spot. The fish tasted fresh still, and you can stuff yourself until your heart's content without breaking the bank.",
