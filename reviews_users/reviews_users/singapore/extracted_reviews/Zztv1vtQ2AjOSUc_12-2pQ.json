    "text": "This is the best restaurant-on-the-fly experience... ever. I work a block away from Alt. Pizza and have been walking past the restaurant everyday, skeptical and all since, um, when you work in the doldrums known as Suntec City everything looks bad, overpriced or both. Hello only 3 bars for after work drinks, $0.70/pc yong tau foo and the crankiest front-of-house staff at the ONLY salad bar in the vicinity? Yup it's that crappy.Anyway, my colleague and I decided to try Alt. Pizza after a long lunchtime meeting. We were starving, it looked empty, cheerful and held the possibility of good food.The order chits were simple i.e. you fill in what you want and hand it to the waiter, and they served iced water free. The average pizza is about 1.5x the size of your face and costs $12-16, which is ah-mazing value for Singapore, let alone an office area. Let me just talk about the pizza for a second. Wow. Thin crust, quickly oven crisped, fresh ingredients, nothing processed and the most insane cheese (I ordered the Free Bird) topped my lovely pie. I kept declaring that I would return again with the dude while chomping down my entire pizza. Yes, I ate the whole thing by myself. I also shared the spinach salad with my colleague and it had the lightest but sufficient dressing and some crushed nuts.I'll probably be eating at Alt. Pizza again, tomorrow. I need to eat every starter on the menu and have some of those craft beers. If you work in the area, PLEASE DON'T COME HERE. I don't want to have to queue up for insanely delicious and affordable pizza. Kthxbye.",

    "text": "I was skeptical at first. Having tried it, I would say this could be the best pizza in Singapore. Affordable ($12, $15, $17). Crafty. Very thin crust. Smaller in size, so you feel loaded with flavors and not calories. The ingredients are not too commercialized and you can taste the difference right away. As a salad and super food lover, I also love their kale salad. Siracha chicken salad reminded me of Siracha salads in many restaurant chains in the US, but better. We tried to guess some mystery ingredients in the sauce that made the Philly Fanatic pizza taste so good, but we couldn't. We could taste real truffle oil in the Truffle Shuffle. Real steak on the pizza. Hard to find these days in the place where pork and beef is not allowed in more and more non-Chinese eating places in Singapore. I downloaded the app and it's quite OK to use. Not super easy to edit the order but I finally found it. Recomended for team meetings or project meetings. If anyone in your office can't touch chilli or pepper at all then you may want to opt in for the \"make your own pizza\" by hand picking the ingredients yourself. The cost for one in this categrory is of course higher. Not very firendly for kids, I think.",

We ordered the old fashioned (so a margarita but they added some dried oregano and basil) however they cooked the basil instead of garnishing it fresh before serving. My pizza dough was over baked - total crisp and edges don't even spring back. Sauce was too sweet, couldn't taste the natural flavour of tomatoes and they put too much on. Cheese of standard quality. Overall, wouldn't go back unless kids are super hungry and can't manage to get to another pizza joint. Must say, service is good.",

Decided to be adventurous and came by to try their pizzas after hearing the good reviews. Hubby and I shared the:Crispy Calamari Fritti - I appreciated the fact that they used real squid rings and not the processed mashed-up-grub that some places pass off as seafood rings. The batter was nice and crispy as its name says but we found it a tad too salty. Other than that, very nice size to share before your own pizzas. Buffalo Bill - hubby liked it quite a bit with the blue cheese taste adequately lacing the pizza. Generous amount of roasted chicken breast meat all over too. Truffle Shuffle - if you like the taste and smell of truffle and this pizza shouts your name. Like my hubby's pizza, generous amount of funnel sausages and roasted mushrooms and onions makes every bite a delight. The interior decor just screams young and hip! Not to mention their colourful and zany pizza box designs!! This pizza place is gonna give other established pizza places a run for their money. The others better watch out for this one.",

    "text": "Been wanting to try this place as quite a few yelp friends told me that it was pretty good. Hence I came here with a friend who loves pizza as well on a Monday noon.This place is located at Exit C of the Promenade MRT station. You would have to turn to the left and keep on walking till you see the Alt. on the right hand side. Was not difficult to find but I decided to ask one of the security guards for direction as it was almost lunch break for most office workers. We were greeted by a staff upon entering this brightly colored place and since it was not as crowded yet, we were able to select our seating arrangements. Prior to coming here, I did my research on what to get beforehand and quickly ordered the food items below to avoid the long waiting time for the dishes.1) Truffle Shuffle Pizza - as many of you might notice, I am a fan of truffles (oil or mushrooms). Decided to head for this to have a \"lighter meal\". The pizza came in 6 slices so my friend and I decided to split into 3 slices each. The pizza was interestingly thinner yet fluffy at the same time. The ingredients were combined perfectly. The cheese that was spread on the pizza were stringy and chewy to my liking. The fennel sausage were cut into too small pieces that I can hardly taste. The temperature of the pizza was not too warm when served that both my friend and I could straightaway bite on it after taking pictures. Do try the chilli oil or the chilli flakes. Tried both of them and I prefer the chilli oil. Your hands will be greasy after using the oil but fear not. This place offer a wet napkin at no cost.2) Alt. Wings - come with bbq sauce or blue cheese sauce. This dish was not entirely made of wings but it has drumsticks too. This reminds me of the buffalo wings I had in the U.S. Pretty flavorful without condiments. I also tried it with the bbq sauce and the blue cheese sauce. I prefer the blue cheese sauce over the bbq sauce. Service was pretty quick. This place also offers some light bites, salads, burgers and DIY pizzas. Pricing wise it is pretty reasonable and this place gets crowded pretty quickly. Definitely a good addition to Suntec City Mall.",

We tried to reserve a spot in advance cause 15 people is quite a bit. Well turns out for a group that large you need of minimum of 25 sgd PER PERSON.

    "text": "Alt Pizza is quite simply a fantastic place to get Pizza in the Suntec City area. I'm still wondering how I missed this place given that my workplace is only a few blocks away. Thanks to the Yelp app for helping my wife (and me) find this hidden gem! The menu is all about Pizza (specifically, individual 11-inch pizzas). Half/Half pizzas with different ingredients are a no-no. \u00a0I ordered the Truffle Suffle - White sauce, parmesan, mozza, white truffle oil, roasted mushrooms and onions, fennel sausage, while my wife ordered the Hangover - organic tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, fennel sausage, roasted onions and parmesan. After the first bite of my pizza, I could not help but think how similar it was to Extra Virgin's Mushroom Bianco, also a truffle infused Pizza. My wife's pizza the Hangover tasted eerily similar to Extra Virgin's Spotted Pig. After doing some research online, I discovered that Chef and owner, Matthew White, came from Extra Virgin Pizza to start Alt Pizza. No Wonder! \u00a0Given this discovery, why not have a Pizza throw-down (an ode to Bobby flay) review: Alt Pizza vs. Extra VirginAlt's Truffle Suffle vs. Extra Virgin's Mushroom Bianco:- Sorry, Alt Pizza, Extra Virgin takes the cake with this one. Extra Virgin's Mushroom Bianco has a roasted mushroom and onion mix that melts in your mouth. Alt's mushroom and onion has the taste, but doesn't deliver the same satisfaction. \u00a0Alt's Hangover vs. Extra Virgin Spotted Pig- Alt's Hangover is the clear winner in this one. My issue with the Spotted Pig is that I feel the pork sausage overpowers the other ingredients and doesn't fuse together like Alt's Hangover. Alt's Hangover is a perfect combination of all the flavours mentioned all of the above. In short, the ingredients mesh well together an mouthwatering taste. I think comparing Alt Pizza to Extra Virgin is really unfair. It is a testament how good both Pizza joints really are. Extra Virgin's pizzas cost a little more, $20-$25 a pie vs Alt Pizza's of $12-$18. Alt Pizza menu is quite limited relative to that of Extra Virgin (Extra Virgin Menu includes Pasta and other cool side dishes like oven baked clams, etc). To conclude, this is a must try establishment in the Suntec City Area.",

Arggggh!In any event, I finally found ALT (no thanks to bad directions to building 3 instead of 4) and what a pleasant surprise. \u00a0 Well worth the walk in the rain. \u00a0Yep!The place was packed for lunch. \u00a0A good sign for sure. One orders up their own pizza and drink on the order pads provided and in 10 minutes I had my custom pizza. \u00a0No cheese, NY style thin crust, tomato sauce and lots of fresh roasted veggies I picked from the list. \u00a0The pies are 11 inches and just right for 1 hungry person! \u00a0Prices are reasonable. \u00a0Had a great \u00a0blood orange soda- my wife's favorite. \u00a0Thank you, ALT! \u00a0You've restored my faith that there's great pizza outside of NYC and Italia...I'll be back. \u00a0\"Mangia!\"",

    "text": "I look towards the weekends with anticipation because that's when I typically pig out! Hehe... The bf and I chanced upon a pizza joint called \"alt pizza\" at Suntec and decided to try. We found the Food choices on the menu quite interesting. There were a good selection of starters, pizza options, drinks. But most of all the prices looked very affordable and won't break a bank.Our order for the evening:1. Kale and green apple salad - I have never had kale before and wanted to try it, as I have heard, watched and read so much about it in the media. I was pleasantly surprised that the salad was awesome! I loved the fact that the honey dijon dressing didn't drench the vege! In fact the dressing complemented the slightly bitter aftertaste of the kale. Definitely a must try!2. Crispy calamari - The calamari were definitely fresh and succulent. They were each wrapped in a thin crusty batter and paired with some seafoody garlicky type of aioli. Pretty awesome! 3. Buffalo bill pizza- So onward came the supposed highlight of the evening. After all this is a pizza joint right? It's thin crusted, slightly spicy pizza with bacon and chicken breast. To be honest, the pizza felt soggy and we would have preferred if it was crispier. I was definitely slightly disappointed! Taste wise it was a tad salty for my liking and at certain bites I actually tasted some flour in my mouth.After dinner I figured out that perhaps \"alt pizza\" could be the short form of \"alternative\". I am not sure, I didn't do much research about this place. But if I were to compare along side some of the pizza joints in town? It's probably in-between Pizza Hut and Skinny pizza. But then what can I say the prices are superbly competitive, these guys are pretty smart... I am sure you will definitely find quite a fair bit of youngsters coming in. My bf and I took a good look around the restaurant, we were right! Will I come back here another time? Probably not, not because they are bad, it's just that I'd rather waste my calories on on other better pizza joints out there, ie. Mozza Pizzeria at MBS.",

    "text": "Best pizza in Singapore by far. Visited Alt Pizza a number of times. Their pizza surprisingly doesn't leave you with an incredibly heavy stomach like many other pizzas (even if you eat a whole one). Their wait staff and pizza makers are friendly and full of smiles.I did the Old School which is a margarita pizza equivalent. I don't know how to describe it, it tasted much better than any other I've ever had.The other time I visited, I went with their meat lovers pizza (don't remember the name) and this one also they nailed. Solid spot to get a beer and fresh pizza. Great setting on the outside of Suntec and awesome menu. I heard the burger is actually really good too!Highly recommend!",

    "text": "I noticed Alt Pizza a couple weeks ago while on a business trip. The ratings were high but I've been to good pizza joints through out the U.S. and comments such as \"best pizza in Singapore\" are a dime a dozen. I didn't get a chance to try it then but I remedied that today. \u00a0Long story short: \u00a0I used to think I made a pretty good pizza. Now I know I have work to do! \u00a0Not exactly sure what I was in the mood for, I figured I'd try Alt Pizza and see what the fuss was about. \u00a0I went with the calamari rings and the hangover pizza. The calamari resembled onion rings in size, much larger than I'd seen before. When dipped in the accompanying sauce, they were quite tasty and helped tide me over until the main course arrived. My hangover pizza arrived right as I finished the calamari and was piping hot out of the oven. Served thin-crust style, it had sausage, pepperoni, and onion for toppings. Right away, I noticed that the organic tomato sauce complemented the crust and toppings perfectly, not over powering nor hiding in the background. Truly one of the best sauces I have ever tasted. The crust was cooked nicely, lightly crispy yet flexible. \u00a0Being thin, the crust doesn't dominate the taste, either. Simply put, this was one tasty pizza!I had planned to try a few different places during the rest of my trip but now I think I may need to make another trip to Alt Pizza to try one of their other creations. The only downside is now I know I've got some work to do on my own pizza skills when I get home.",

    "text": "At Alt Pizza, you've got to take charge and know what you want.They've got their specialty pizzas, and to be honest, most of the combinations sounded very weird. They sometimes do specials if you order their specialty pizza, and they were running a great deal when we went there (2 specialty pizzas + 2 starters for $45). But none of the specialty pizzas appealed to us, so we built our own pizzas. It ended up being a $3-$5 more for each pizza than if we had gotten specialty pizzas, but we got exactly what we wanted.For cheeses, they've got at least 5 different choices -- regular mozzarella, blue cheese, manchego, parmesan, goat cheese are some that I remember. You can put prosciutto, wagyu meatballs, fennel sausage on your pizza. The combinations are great, the only thing that I miss is an egg.The pizzas are thin, done true Italian style. Some places in Singapore charge $25 for the pizza that I ordered for $15 -- so all in all, a very good value. \u00a0We ordered 1 pizza each,and it was plenty of food. I think 2 people could share 1 pizza and 1 starter, but then you'd have to fight over which pizza to get.Alt Pizza is OUTSIDE of the Suntec mall (if you're walking inside the mall, you won't find the entrance.) There's plenty of signs, but go outside to the taxi stand outside of the Suntec tower and look around.",
