    "text": "fantastic seafood and zi char at this casual chinese restaurant nearish the singapore expo - really, it's rather out of the way (for us), but it's now become my family's go-to place for crabs and the like, and well-worth travelling to. the place has been packed to the rafters even by early evening (we popped here on two consecutive sundays because it was so good) - but the prices are reasonable, the food is absolutely commendably executed, and service is both sincere and quick.having spent a few years away, I've gained newfound appreciation for places like this one - where you can viably decide not to cook and pay a little more for a balanced meal: this isn't really an option you often get in london - not such variety at equivalent prices, anyway.the food here is great - and it draws large crowds despite occupying two shop spaces in an obscure location, so I recommend reservations, and also that you head down for a spot of great seafood no matter where you are. it beats those too-crowded options at the east coast - you know which ones I mean - in price, service and quality.",

    "text": "My friends and I were on a quest for crabs and we googled for new places that we haven't checked out and read about this place call Big Eater Seafood. We decided to check it out as none of us have been there although it seemed to be a popular seafood restaurant in Simpang Bedok. They are super packed and even provide valet services as parking is limited here.I am very intrique by the wall of crab shells graffti that their customers have left behind. Tucked away in the east, we tried some of their popular dishes like the salted egg crabs and the KL hokkein mee, pretty yummy and we were not disappointed. Definitely worth coming back and checking out their other dishes. I love how the management at this chain restaurants name their chain stores pretty catchy. This particular one is call big eater seafood, they have the other outlets by the name of Grand Eater \u00a0and Master Crab.",

    "text": "Standard orders here are 1 x chili crab, 1 x salted egg yolk crab, 1 vegetable dish, and the not to be missed KL hokkien mee. BE is unusual in the sense that it's a largish, airy restaurant; quite unlike the crowded and claustrophobic settings with grumpy aunties that seem to be the norm at other seafood places. And surprisingly, the service is actually good. The aunties are friendly, and it's easy to catch their attention for advice (are we ordering too much??) and extra drinks. The crabs are firm and fresh, though the experts will tell you not to order when the moon is full or something like that. The salted egg yolk crab is better than the chili, while he KL hokkien mee is a happy heart attack on a plate; a mess of black stringy noodles and liberally sprinkled with lard. Oh so good. Prices are ok, and have been correspondingly adjusted for inflation, much to the the dismay of customers. There's valet parking too, which is a good option due to limited lots.",

While they still serve up a mean salted egg crab, the rest of the menu leaves a lot to be desired. \u00a0The seafood they served previously used to be one of the freshest around. The crabs were meaty and juicy, but these days they seem to have gotten considerably smaller.Bad points aside, the dried chilli frog is pretty decent, along with their signature KL hokkien mee. These are worth trying but I doubt its going to be enough to warrant a second visit.",

    "text": "Big Eater is popular seafood restaurant near Simpang Bedok. It is constantly packed with people, especially on weekends. I love their Malaysia styled fried Hokkien Mee (dark sauce!!!). On some days, the noodles seem to be too overloaded with lard. But usually, it should be fine. They are also known for their Seafood Crystal Horfun, which is cooked with generous portions of fresh seafood. The deep fried beancurd skin is also worth a try! Fresh seafood wrapped with beancurd skin. Although sometimes the wait can really be long (be prepared to wait up to 20 minutes on packed days!), I like that the seafood they use is really fresh and they give generous portions. Last but not least, I think they need to space out the place a little more. It can get really noisy when the restaurant's packed with people.",

The chili crab is delicious and so is the hokkien mee. Against my will I have been dragged here several times, but the food doesn't stop to surprise me. What erks me about this restaurant is the congestion and noise. They obviously are maximizing space with the amounts of tables set up. I wouldn't say much about the atmosphere, I wouldn't even give it more than one star, but the real reason why this place is so packed is because of the quality of the food.The service is constantly busy and is a task just trying to waive one down. The prices are reasonable, very satisfactory for the great food they serve!",
