I decided to treat myself to some satay and there was no better place to go to than the Best in stall 7 & 8.I got half the smallest set for $13 with 5 sticks chicken, 5 sticks beef and 3 sticks prawn. Ot was all delicious and I love the flavoir of the dipping sauce. I got a large iced kopi from the nearby Kopitiam stall and it was a nice, refreshing way to end the day.",

The satay and the amazing chutney with a cold beer. very friendly staff and the owner is out there mingling with the customers as well making sure everything goes right. if you ask her for something you can enjoy while she yells at one of her workers to bring it to you.. awesome. We LOVED this place. Thank you for being a great welcome in our first few hours in singapore. Also grab a stretched tea!",

Occupying 2 stalls along 'Satay Street' which opens at 7 pm beside Lau Pa Sat, Best Satay is one of a few Satay stalls competing the for satay-and-supper-loving customers who visit the place. My friends and I were no exception and after a 'light' meal, we decided to have satay to round off our dinner. It was a good decision even if I felt bloated after the meal. I loved the grilled sweet and savoury taste of the satay and the peanut sauce that accompanied it with just the right runniness. I've only tried the chicken satay because I don't like the other meats, but it was delicious and at only $0.60 per stick. In fact, the satay is often the reason we choose to eat at Lau Pa Sat.",
