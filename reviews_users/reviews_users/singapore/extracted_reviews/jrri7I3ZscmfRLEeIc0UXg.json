Not many ingredients - a bit of cabbage, lots of onions.The banchan were(was?) fantastic! 12 dishes that all tasted great. Largest variety I've seen in Singapore and refillable (for no charge? I'm unsure). Only white rice available. I liked this place better than 3 meals a day - I felt they went a bit easier on the seasonings but my plus one thought the food at 3 meals tasted fresher. The food did still leave me very thirsty though. I guess Korean food has more MSG than I'd like it to.I'd like to try to try the hotpot soups - saw plenty of tables with them.",

    "text": "Kim's Family Food is tucked in a corner near Beauty World mrt station. It is a pretty homely place with 2 units. One unit has stronger barbecue smell so you may want to choose the other unit if it has available seats. The best part about this place is the side dishes which get replenished. They include omelette, seaweed, anchovies, brinjals, bean sprouts and many more. The soup with noodles and ingredients like meat or seafood is a pretty good deal. Serving is generally big so do not go overboard with the orders. Haha.",

Kim's Family Restaurant has been recommended by friends before and thus i needed to find out what is it about it that makes it popular.Well, it turns out that i was quite disappointed. It's not that the food wasn't good. It just wasn't up to that raised expectations. Huge variety of side dishes, a total of 12 in fact. I love how it's refillable and that has my favorite anchovies, beancurd skin and vegetables. We ordered a meat set for sharing and it wasn't cheap. I believe it's more than 50 bucks for that few pieces of meat which weren't very well marinated. The soondubujigae (seafood beancurd soup) was also a little on the bland side. I would always order this dish at any Korean restaurant so that i can compare the standard. This was very meh. Overhyped and over priced. There are better korean restaurants out there.",

    "text": "The food here is not the absolute best, but they have a bit of everything made almost right. They have the most extensive menu I've seen so far. This evening, we ordered the soondae guk bap, dogani tang and a buchu jeon. I was tempted to order the bossam, but I'm already cooking something similar for tomorrow's dinner. Maybe the next time.Dinner starts with 12 banchans, all pretty good. I haven't seen so many banchans since I last visited a Korean restaurant in NYC. The serving staff were friendly and offered refills when they noticed an empty dish.The pancake was fried just nice, was on the thin side and slightly crunchy. They add red chilli pieces as garnish, but the flavor doesn't bleed into the pancake, so I liked it.The dogani tang came with plenty of tendon. The broth was light and very peppery. I didn't like the pepper, and will make it a point to ask for less pepper if I ever get it again. But there are other things to try.The soondae guk comes with spicy paste on the side so that you can tailor the dish to your personal preferences. I like the idea. I usually eat my soondae guk without spice. It came with plenty of scallions and a tiny pile of pepper, which made the soup overly peppery. I think this can't be helped if perilla leaves and seeds are not really available in Singapore, but it was still too much pepper. There were plenty of choice organ meat pieces like a good soondae guk, but the flavor of the soup was less rich than I would like. The soondae though was pretty surprising.Like all sausages, soondae was made with intestines once upon a time. But I've only seen the modern version with the thin synthetic casing. Not here though. The unusually skinny soondae was actually a small intestine stuffed with vermicelli. I was really curious about where they got this soondae from, but we didn't ask. I'll have to order soondae here again. Real intestine casing is much chewier than the synthetic case, and a lot more graphic to look at. I think we will be back some other time for bossam too. And maybe to buy some raw kalbi from the grocery store next door for home.",

    "text": "I've been to Kim's a couple of times not because the food is fantastic, but it is probably the only Korean option around my neighbourhood. Eating at Kim's is always a rushed affair- not only because the seats are poorly arranged (and the place is always crowded), but also because the entire place sometimes gets so stuffy due to the bad ventilation that I cant stand sitting in there any longer.What I like about Kim's is actually their starters- they have the standard items like kimchi, ikan bilis etc. They also have the unusual practice of refilling your starters if its \u00a0finished before the main course arrives, something which I am not entirely sure if I appreciate. Sometimes I feel so full from the starters that I no longer have any appetite left for the main course. As for their main course, they serve pretty decent Korean food, even though some are probably not good enough to justify the slightly steep prices. I usually have the ramyeon (maggi mee in soup), which sometimes come too soft probably due to overcooking.Service in the restaurant is generally prompt, but it might get quite hard to get a waitstaff's attention when the place is too crowded. Also, the place can get quite noisy when it is full since everything is packed quite closely together. The final verdict? Not terrible enough to avoid, but not fantastic enough to make a special trip unless you are already in the area.",

    "text": "Being a student who used to study in the area and a friend insane about all things Korean, I was inevitably introduced to this family restaurant operated by a native Korean family. I was pleasantly surprised at all trendy the decor was, and that they allowed patrons to doodle upon the walls. As expected, there were many KPop names scrawled accompanied by love hearts. As per Korean culture, before the main dish comes a huge array of various side dishes, both cold and hot that are fully refillable - one of the points I love about Korean restaurants! Their portions of side dishes are also slightly larger than normal. They serve the ever popular kimchi, pickled radishes and cucumber, salted fishes and egg rolls amongst many others. However I do feel their pricing for their meat dishes are too high for their mediocre quality of food. A portion of meat for BBQ costs almost $40 for supposedly one person, but it is possible to be shared between 2 people if you order rice to go with the meat. While it is tasty, I would not say that it is the freshest. But price aside, it is a nice secluded spot, right opposite the Toh Yi Drive estate in bukit timah, with coupon parking just next to it.",
