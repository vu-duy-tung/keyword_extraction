    "text": "I am so glad my friend told me about this hidden gem!!!! We took a cab here from Chinatown because we were not sure where it was, but it's actually a short walk from a subway station, so take the subway to save on transportation expenses.  We had the Hagrid's Afternoon Tea and I am so glad we ordered it! \u00a0Everything on the menu was delicious. I have to admit that I wasn't sure if the items would look exactly like it was on the menu because there are those places where the pictures in the menu are better then what you get and then there are those places where the pictures in the menu don't do them justice. Well, these pictures represented exactly what we received! This is a perfect place for any \"true\" fan. Yes I say true because I have read reviews on here where they say that their friend didn't realize it was a HP caf\u00e9. How are you a true fan and not notice this? Seriously!!!! From the menu, to the decorations, to the photo area, it all screams Harry Potter!!!!! \u00a0If you want to order the Hagrid's Afternoon Tea, keep in mind that it starts at 2pm and it's in limited quantities. Also, come with an appetite as it is a lot of food for 2 people. At least I think it's a lot of food. My husband had the seafood menu items, and he said they tasted really good. I had the non-seafood menu items and it was so delicious! All the desserts were amazing! Though I did order some coffee to counteract the sweetness of the desserts. Overall, a must for any HP fan that is visiting Singapore!",

We arrived pretty late at night and I was surprised to see diners dressed up in what appeared to be Harry Potter cosplay - but no, the cafe has outfits that you can wear to get in the spirit of things! The decor is so cute and very appropriately Hogwarts-like. Had I come in the daytime, I think the natural lighting would have made for some amazing pictures. We got the butterscotch ale, and though I've never been to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, my friend who has said it tasted JUST like the butterbeer you can find there. It was delicious. The food was surprisingly good for a theme cafe. We got the confit chicken with pesto spaghetti and the pesto mayo pork ribs. Both were really well cooked, not too much pesto on either but enough to give you a could flavor. The pork ribs were super tender and the sides that came with it were delicious, very American-style like mashed potatoes and sweet corn. I loved it and that's coming from an American mashed potato addict. The witch's brew, although I didn't try it, seems like it's something you can't miss here. I was excited to see another diner get it, and the flaming drink looks exactly like a potion from Harry Potter. If I have one regret it's not trying that!",

The moment you stepped in, you will be welcomed with brown decorated interior (brown chairs, brown wooden tables, brown wall tiles and etc...) that adds up to the theme. We asked for the signature drink and was told that it was on the menu, \"Mr Lich's Brewing Brew\" ($15). When served, it is a cup of neon blue colored drink that looks like magic portion, which is actually made up of lime juice and Curacao liqueur. A spoon full of Barcardi 151 Rum, was then torched by the server before pouring it into the mixture. You will be given cinnamon powder to sprinkle for the sparkling effects. Abracadabraaaa boom!We ordered the 2 cakes that taste as good as they looks! The Lychee Cake has a very nice fruity lychee flavor, very fluffy and not too sweet. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake is interesting good, with a complex flavorful the first spoonful.Tips: ~ Feel free to pick a few props from the side table when posing with your food and Goblet of Fire drink. \u00a0~ They accept reservations, call them in advance as they get pretty booked for dinner and on weekends.[009/100]",

    "text": "Harry Potter is my childhooood and coming to this place in all it's entirety I had a lot of expectations! I saw this place in one of the Facebook videos being shared. I had an opportunity to go to Singapore and went directly here to see what the hype was all about! Singapore is a great place by the way and I love the country and its great food! Now going back here, the decor was amazing and they have costumes and wands and broomsticks you can wear to take the coolest pictures and videos with their food! I remember while waiting for our food and drinks, my friends and I had battles with the wands haha. I ordered the famous drink that lights up when sprinkled with cinnamon. It was the coolest thing I've ever done. It was particularly of course my favorite part in the restaurant. The drink itself was good and let me tell you that it's an alcoholic drink. We ordered a lot of desserts since we ate from one of the hawk centers there. The food we got was why this place is only a three stars for me. I took out two because it was just not very good. I had so much expectations. I wanted it to be as magical in my mouth with the expensive price point. For one dish it was like $15-16 and so I was hoping it would be worth it. But it's not. This restaurant just needs better food and more people will flock here especially since it's Harry Potter, the business owners need to use that to their advantage and give their customers a more deserving magical and whimsical experience.",

And yet, disappointing in execution.I came to Platform 1094 for the ever-famous cauldron drink and was thrilled to find a costume rack complete with robes, hats, wands and stuffed animals to complete the experience. This feature was the extent of the magical experience. While I loved the small touches, like the wooden stag chairs, the cauldron drink we received was less than impressive, beyond the sparks that fly when you dash it with cinnamon.It was great to visit once, but definitely won't be making a repeat appearance in my itinerary.",

For a themed cafe, I expected more; to see the theme being reflected in the food, the drinks, the decor, etc. Ambience wise, the only thing close to Harry Potter were the brick plastered walls... they had props, but there wasn't enough to go around (& also, they only had gryffindor robes :/). To give them credit, they did try to create \"potions\" which lit up, but again, that was only one drink (their signature) \u00a0Taste wise, everything was pretty standard; drinks needed more alcohol,",

Based on theme, it is really cutely Harry Potter. You cannot miss it- the corner had a whole wardrobe and some of the wall decor looks like ads out of Harry Potter. The drinks were mediocre at best and pricy. While the signature drink was clever and fun, it was weak. My husband had it because I don't like the taste of alcohol. However, when I drank it, it tasted like fruit juice that I think I could have handled it. I ordered a fruit smoothie (S$8), and I feel like I could have gotten 3 of these at the nearby food courts. Nothing memorable. Overall, I feel the experience and quality together rounds this place to a 3 stars",

You can also play dress up with the ropes for Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Interesting drinks as potions. It would have been better if the staff were more upbeat or dressed to fit the theme instead of just black tee shirts. Wouldn't mind coming back to try the dinner menu.",

I can definitely feel the Harry Potter vibe in the menu selection, and I glad they didn't make it exactly like in the movies, I want food that I am actually able to eat lol.
