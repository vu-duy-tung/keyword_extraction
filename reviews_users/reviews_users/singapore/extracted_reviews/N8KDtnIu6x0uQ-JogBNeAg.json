It's like egg in the hole, bread toasted till crispy but the yolk is not overcooked. I'm in love with their bacon jam on the side.Coffee is definitely the selling point here.I tried their choc croissant during my second visit. It was good. And because I couldn't forget my love for their bacon jam, I requested for the jam on the side (add $2). I know it sounds weird but the savoury jam actually went well with the sweet croissant.Be warned that this place is always very crowded on weekends!",

    "text": "Recently the cafe had updated its menu with new items such as XL crispy chicken burger and Furikake Mushroom pasta. Order was taken at counter with only cash and NETS payment accepted.Sriracha Pork Belly Burger ($15)served with sweet potato friesThe pork belly was fatty with a texture similar to soft bone, although I was expecting a melt in a mouth fatty part with a crispy crust. The burger was not as spicy as expected. It was not messy to eat the burger. The fries was lacking of crispiness.Coffee Soda ($6) It was a glass of soda, accompanied with a glass of espresso. Just add the espresso into the soda before drinking. It tasted like soda drink with a coffee aftertaste. Quite refreshing for a hot day.",

The croissant was large and flakey, but not too buttery. It was so good that I devoured it before taking a picture. I'll definitely have to come back to try the coffee next time!They also have some outdoor seating which includes a few hanging coves, which I found perfect for reading. Sitting outside is a nice alternative if you want a bit of peace and quiet. Most of their tables are in the shade, so it's not too hot on a typical day. L",

Nice ambience, not too noisy for a lazy Sunday morning, and very affordable prices (average $10 as opposed to the $15 average in other cafes).Tried the Gashouse Eggs ($10) and Brioche French Toast with Berry Compote, Candied Walnuts & Fresh Cream ($10). The Gashouse Eggs seemed like a Croque Monsieur, satisfactory, though slightly on the greasy side. Egg could be runnier as well, though the bacon jam on the side was interesting.The French Toast was perfect, not too sweet, crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",

    "text": "I am not in the habit of awarding five stars for a single dish as I normally feel that it requires more than that but trying the French toast with caramelized bananas and salty caramel is just great. I will return just for that. It is perfectly fluffy, not overly sweet and feels fresh. The big brekkie is also very good but it does pale in comparison to the French toast but as I seldom come here alone I will force anyone going with me to share a Big Brekkie and the French toast with me (just a fair warning if I ever suggest going here with you).The coffee is nicely made, perfect execution on all the espresso based beverages. Unfortunately no filters but can head down the road to Pacamara for that. The service has also been very friendly and they managed the packed place rather well. Worth mentioning is that it shares the space with a pizza place so in the evenings it transforms into a pizza place. Never tried the pizzas there but it does make the setting feel a bit strange but nice with some variety from all the other similarly looking places.",

    "text": "I've been rather hardworking for the past couple of weeks in checking out the cafes. Well I must say that Instagram has been most helpful in keeping me updated with the prettiest caf\u00e9s on the block and that kinda led me to One Man Coffee, a hole in the wall that shares their shop front with Crust gourmet Pizza Bar along Upper Thomson Road. Sip on the Melbournian Axil Coffee Roaster beans pulled by Sarah Jane (formerly from Immigrants) or E-gene (who pulled his way around MEL). Coffee is little acidic with medium finish. My latte wasn't quite full bodied or milky though. While it's not quite my style, it was sufficient in packing a punch to last me through my afternoon meeting. Coffee is priced between $3 to $6.50. OMC also stocks B.A.O's pastries. I simply love Christophe's croissants, well the French makes the best croissants! The Chocolate pain is also amazing. Get them to heat it up for that crispy flakiness. Better still, have them with honey ham and melted cheese ($6). Cakes are also available and I was seduced by a Salted Caramel Banana Cake.For something a little more than sweets, OMC does all-day-breakfast with a lean but mean menu, all of which come out of a pizza oven! Talk about easy to make but delicious food here! Love the description of the Gashouse Egg aka Toad in hole aka Egg-in-the-bread-with-the-hole-in-the-middle ($10). It's more of a snack I feel. I really do have a monster appetite for breakfast food. The dish is really simple, they really do just make a hole in the fluffy brioche, crack an egg in, top with cheese and into the oven it goes. Almost a croque madame.Really there's no need to be fancy for brekkie when the ingredients are good (hello ooooozy yolk). What's special is that bacon jam which is smoky, meaty and sweet. I could do with a thick layer of that in the toast anytime. Satisfying flavors, a little dry on the edges, not so satisfying portion but that helps save space for other food. The Broiche French Toast ($10) is another popular item and it looked freaking amazing with the homemade berry compote, candied walnuts and fresh cream. Of course the dust of sugary white completes the instagram worthy picture. OMC is a great alternative to the super packed Habitat Coffee which I failed to visit TWICE! Well I guess I'll just have to explore the rest of the Thomson caf\u00e9s until Habitat becomes less crowded. Anyhoo, great vibe at One Man Coffee but do go early or be prepared to wait as well due to the extremely small space.",

Seating done by a list is not extremely effective if you have a maitre'd who is easily pushed around. Granted it was a Saturday afternoon and from what I've heard (they're always packed), I felt that it should have been made clear that there was a waiting list for seating. Numerous parties after me all sat down at the same seats and were told of their policy and had to get up soon after. Would slapping a reserve sign on the table be so hard? On to coffee, we had a cappuccino and long black, the milk wasn't frothed well, and the long black was just the darkest point of my life to say the least. Last but not least, everyone around was ordering the french toast, so maybe you might have better luck with that than the coffee?",
