Must have been sitting in the kitchen for a bit too long.Prawns were nice, don't really like the ugon sauce but it's not bad bad. Just not to my liking.Rice - choice of garlic or steamed. Garlic of course!Chawanmushi custard egg - nice.Miso soup Dessert was a chocolate mousse - so so.Good size portions.Overall a good meal.What I didn't like? It opened its doors at 12 noon; not a minute earlier. So there were lots of people standing outside the restaurant and going into it was another wait.",

Absolutely love the chirashi don there. Toro, sweet uni, botan ebi, ikura, kinmedai and lots more! I didn't like the truffle kanpachi though. Felt that the sauce overwhelmed the fish and there was hardly any truffle aroma or otherwise. The tako age was pretty awesome. Tender octopus with a nice crispy crust. I found it slightly salty but the friend found it ok. What I don't like is that they charge $5 for green tea though. The tea is a standard hojicha blend and nothing special in the taste to me ):",

There were about 9 or 10 food that came out one by one from appetiser to dessert. The stars of the night were the hokkaido snow crab tempura and hairy crab appetiser. The dessert was way too plain, regular and generic for its class. Nonetheless, everything else was grandeur. (I coulda given them perfect rating if they had much better dessert alternative though).",

My dinner kaki and I went for the $138++ Season 2 Dinner Course last night and topped up our meal with Wasabi Oysters $26++, Truffle Kampachi $28++ and sake pairing $50++.I enjoyed the oysters and sake (of course) very much, but that's about it. The rest of the dishes were decent, but it wasn't a meal that warranted the $500+ dinner bill.What disappointed me especially for the price that we paid, were my meat course of Miso Braised Wagyu Beef, Daikon and Okura, and the sushi course of Mikuni style \"Kai Sen Don\" with crab, uni and salmon roe with crab miso soup.The freshness of the proteins, most unfortunately in the case of the uni in the sushi course, was crushed by the overpowering flavours of the supporting ingredients. Freshness and clean flavours are what I appreciate most about Japanese cuisine. And that's what I did not get last night.To be fair, the food is not terrible. But it surely doesn't justify the hefty price tag.",

    "text": "Mikuni at Fairmont Hotel currently is in the top 3 spot of my list of awesome Japanese restaurants in Singapore. The classy and uber luxe establishment puts a modern spin on traditional Japanese dishes and offers diners a mix of Japanese cuisine such as robatayaki, sushi, sashimi, teppanyaki, as well as gourmet preparation of several degustation menu carefully thought of by the chefs.Decided to go for the 8 Course Grand Tasting Tour Menu (S$220) and added on another main dish and sushi. This was more than enough for 2 person. There is a 6 Course \"Season 1\" Dinner Course for S$138 if you have a smaller appetite. Our server recommends that for individual portions.Special mention is that Tai Chazuke with Sesame and Signature Soup. This rice dish was pure indulgent yet comfort food. I've had this rice porridge on my first trip to Tokyo. C brought us to this hidden place which served a really homey rice porridge with a broth served in a teapot. This particular soup base is made from Kunbu, the best quality seaweed/kelp. A small 30cm x 10cm piece costs S$100 apparently. The whole set up is resembles a chemistry experiment. The soup is set to boil in a round bottomed flask which is connected to a container that holds the Bonito flakes.Love the service. Food was quite good. Great place to go for a special meal",

    "text": "Mikuni is an upmarket \u00a0japanese restaurant that dish out traditional japanese food (sushi, teppanyaki and robatayaki) with a modern approach. This restaurant has been around for slightly over a year and it replaces the famed Inagiku.My husband and I decided to celebrate our anniversary over lunch at Mikuni. Aside from their set meals, they do have a rather extensive ala carte menu for you to choose from. We were spoilt for choices and we ended up order their lunch sets coupled with some ala carte top up. The food were excellent and the sashimi were really fresh. \u00a0One of the dish that left me a deep impression is their signature soup, a rich mushroom broth with seafood served in a siphon filter. It is interesting to see how the soup is being 'cooked'. Needless to say, the soup was flavorful. As with fine-dining, the service here is excellent. The wait staff is very attentive to the customers' needs. Thanks to our Feed at Raffles card, it makes dining at Mikuni more affordable as you get 50% off your total food bill for you and your 1 guest. \u00a0Definitely, I will come back one day to try Grand Tasting Tour.",

    "text": "Had a business lunch here a few days ago. I'd add this to my list of great restaurants to hold meetings in/bring clients. It's a modern Japanese restaurant tucked away in Fairmont hotel and the atmosphere is lively but not intrusive when you want to have a conversation. I had a Lunch Bentou that cost around $90, definitely on the high side even for a high end Japanese restaurant. Hence I'd suggest going if you have a corporate card and not your own dime, at least not for lunch. My bento had fresh sashimi, a perfectly grilled miso cod and a not so impressive ebi and vegetable tempura. There were other small dishes too and a delicious prawn head miso soup and really, I had no complaints. The tempura batter could have been more light but otherwise, the shrimp was sweet and fresh. I felt like the food, while subtle, was made meticulously in a way you'd expect from the Japanese, except of course that the kitchen is probably not Japanese and head chef, as my Korean counterpart pointed out, is Korean.Finally, I also liked that the staff were very well trained and unobtrusive during out meal. There's nothing more annoying than being interrupted in the middle of a conversation because the waitress wants to shove food in your space. Nothing of that sort here. Great experience all round.",

The chef was excellent and the seafood was excellent but I cannot give this place five stars BECAUSE OF THE INSANELY OUTRAGEOUS BILL!!! One piece of sushi.....ONE PIECE....$30USD!I have been around the world and this place takes the cake for most outrageous billing. I even mentioned to them that my bill said Omakase ($100US), but I was still billed for separate items.I have no one to blame but myself to taking this place on...and I suppose they get all there business from corporate accounts....but karma is karma....watch out!",

Both were amazingly flavorful and yummy! The fish was very fresh and accented with a touch of truffle flavor; it was heavenly. We had some salmon sashimi, salmon belly maki. The fish was fresh and well marinated... absolutely delish! To end, we had the soba of the day.. a huge bowl of soba noodles in spicy broth topped with marinated herring. Yum yum! great way to round off the meal! We will definitely be revisiting.. though with the hefty price tag, probably not that often!",
