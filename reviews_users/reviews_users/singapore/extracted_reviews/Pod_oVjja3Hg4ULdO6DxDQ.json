However the three prawns that came with it (I could only stomach two) tasted fishy and not fresh. Gross. Portion is also small and didn't taste very authentic. Also, I don't know of an actual Vietnamese dish that looks like this so perhaps I'm ignorant.",

Now I have had my fair share of sandwiches and growing up in New Zealand I have eaten them from breakfast to dinner But when you have bahn mi, you get to taste a lot more than just mayo and pickles.Bahn mi is all about the flavors and spices. This place has them, they're run by Vietnamese people and the place is quite at first but then gets lively when that 10 am hits as Singapore starts their day around then.I grabbed the sambal chicken which had chicken cooked in sambal or CHILLI. It's amazing what spice can do to a dish and this place has it. I can't wait to have some pho as that is hard to get as well in the shore in New Zealand !!",

    "text": "Have been seeing Nam Nam with ridiculously long queues but finally had the chance to try it at PS (yes, slow, I know).Not sure what to expect but everyone knows how hard it is to find good Vietnamese food in Singapore. I must say I was please tot surprised! The soup was nice and delicate and everything tasted fresh and crisp, the way Vietnamese food should be. The Spring Roll's skin was a little bit starchy as compared to others I've tried but the Pho was delicious! Over the course of 2 visits, we tried the beef slices, pork ball, beef ball and mixed beef. The beef balls were a little touched than your average beef ball, and the beef slices were lacking that fat content, making it turn hard and dry very quickly, however, the pork balls are to die for! We even had the chance to try their friend banana with coconut cream and that was lovely as well. It's a good casual place for a reasonably price bite in orchard (sandwiches at $6.90 and Pho's starting at $9.90).The only setback about the place was the service. Staff were a little rude and the last at the cashier always gave this \"matter-of-fact-ly\" tone, while they had no idea which direction they wanted customers to queue to pay. Was a bit chaotic at the entrance while customers who are there for the first time, aren't sure if they should order and pay before being seated or after as the queue to be seated, leads straight to the cashier. However, despite the service, the food comes out at a decent place and it's a great place to grab lunch as their lunches come with a free drink, which is great for a simple yet tasty lunch.",

    "text": "I always have a thing or two for Vietnamese noodles - one of my favourites in my list. This restaurant always catch my attention whenever I enter the entrance or the extended building. I have been here a couple of times, but to be honest I haven't been convinced by the quality of the noodles and soup. On this trip, I ordered the beef combination beef clear noodles and it cost $11. Don't be misled by the size of the bowl, it looks huge but when I saw the portion of the noodles, I was disappointed and left shaking my head especially to my friend who was as bewildered as me. The noodles and soup are average, I taste better ones at food courts and at a lower price, so my overall experience was a disappointing one and not to mention the meal was hardly filling. Perhaps 1/2 full? My friend ordered the sandwich and it looks small but he found it to be nice. As for the service, it was slow, perhaps short-handed. To order your meal, you have to go to pay first before your food comes. For this part they get points for it as the food was served quite fast. Overall, I am not in a hurry to come back here, there are other better Vietnamese food outlets out there I feel.",

    "text": "Nam Nam will never be my first choice for Vietnamese food, but in Singapore, beggars can't be choosers. The great thing about Nam Nam is it's convenience:. It has two locations in Orchard and another one in City Hall. I usually order the beef pho and/or chicken meatball baguette. I say and/or because I would order the beef pho and then take out chicken meatball baguette for dinner :P I like the beef pho broth here bc they add cinnamon so there's an extra kick of flavor. The noodles are usually too soft and I always have to request for extra mint, but overall, not bad pho for Singapore! As for the chicken meatball baguette, the pate is chicken pate. So, ask for extra! This particular branch isn't bad and is quite roomier than the Wheelock one. So I suggest popping by this branch during peak hours as opposed to the one at Wheelock. Tip: If you're doing takeaway, make sure you tell the staff. Take away orders get to jump the queue. Do note, they charge an extra 50 cents per each item for takeaway.",
