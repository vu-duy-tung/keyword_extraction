    "text": "Expectations weren't high for conveyor belt sushi at $1.50 a plate but you know what, I was pleasantly surprised. Especially, again, at $1.50 a plate. Free green tea doesn't hurt either. The selection is pretty broad and the food does come out at a good pace as it travels along the long snaky conveyor belt. I was more surprised that you could get tuna and salmon sashimi at, again, $1.50 a plate. You'll have to wait a while for the nicer things to come around as you watch the fillers go by but it's fine if you're not in a rush. All in all, the food is actually decent and again, at $1.50 a plate, makes for a cheap sushi lunch.Reset expectations, again, at $1.50 a plate and tuck in.",

    "text": "4 stars bc the sushi is great and the $1.50 really hits the sweet spot. There's no menu so pick and choose the small dishes right after the conveyer belt. Sometimes it does take awhile for the favorite items to come by (ie salmon sashimi, unagi nigri, etc) but they do eventually come--patience is a venture! My favorite item is actually the scallop--they're huge! Unlimited green tea and wet tissue--enjoy!",

It's good prices for tuna sashimi, uni, shishamo fish and ikura and more! The queue was alright but started getting long after 7 pm. I suggest trying the abalone pieces, tuna, ikura, the cream puff and the Caramelized sweet potatoes ( awesome dessert). The rest were pretty ok and the price made it worthwhile. You wouldn't burn a hole in your pocket eating sushi now.",

So here is my experience at Sushi Express. Came here around 12 on saturday, it wasnt crowded yet maybe because it is still early. This long conveyor belt were filled with salmon when i first arrived, the variety was improving around 10 mins later.The sushi were okay, werent that fresh, and i wish there are more variety",

While the rice may not be up to par with the other fancy Japanese restaurants, the range of fish is pretty varied. However, somedays are not so great, with less choice. But I'm not sure whether its a particular day on which this happens. Either way, still worth a try!",

Nevertheless, it still satisfies a poor man's craving for sushi! I suggest you steer far, far away from their desserts though, especially their cheesecakes as their \"Japanese chefs\" have clearly not yet perfected the art of cheesecake-making.",
