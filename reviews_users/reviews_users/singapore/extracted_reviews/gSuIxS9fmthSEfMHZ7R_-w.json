Quality of sushi ingredients are quite good as well. Many outlets in the city. Reasonable price.",

Thankfully, its a decently sized restaurant so the wait isn't usually too bad.There are tables that can hold big groups (up to 6 people) so its a good place to come with a group. There are plenty of non sushi dishes too, if you have friends in the group who do not eat sushi.I've been here many times but this time went I went, there was barely any raw fish on the conveyer belt. There was mostly cooked items such as fried salmon skin, tempura roll or baked salmon maki. Therefore, we ended up ordering most of our sushi.The newer items on the menu include spicy salmon and spicy tuna roll. I didn't try these though as i am a fan of normal raw fish without all the extra sauces.The sashimi here is decently priced- I quite enjoyed the salmon sashimi with ikura.If you are shopping in Paragon and want to get some sushi, come here!",

    "text": "We have been visiting Sushi Tei since its founding in the mid 90's. It is the most reliable among the mid-price Japanese eateries in Singapore, although prices have creeped up in recent years. Wide-ranging options (from sushi/sashimi to cooked food), and quality is good throughout. Don't order the more 'expensive' items here (otoro, uni, even ankimo, etc) - they're not as fresh, just wait until you go to the high-end sushi restaurants. The Paragon outlet is probably the most elegant-looking in the chain; however, the management of the dining room is below average. There is always a long queue, yet when you go in, there are lots of empty, already clean tables/counter seats; furthermore their placing of customers is not always optimal (eg. 2 customers at a 4-people booth, etc). The food often comes out in random order (starch like fried rice/noodles WAY before sashimi or salad), and sometimes they forget an order or serve the wrong dressing. How is that possible if not poor management - these problems could easily be fixed with data provided by the iPad ordering system.",

Over the years, I felt the standard has been dropping or maybe I started going to better Japanese/sushi places and so reduced the time spent in chain sushi places. I did not have a good experience at Sushi Tei after it moved to this current location and so stopped patronizing it for the longest while. The last time I stepped foot in it was probably last year and what I had was average.So it took me by surprise that what I ordered recently were actually pretty good. Maybe it was because I had the cooked dishes, and not sashimi, chirashi or raw stuff. The yakiniku don was to die for. Very tender slices of beef (full of flavor) and soft sweet onions over the fluffy sticky short grain Japanese rice with a drizzle of sauce. Each mouthful was just so delightful and packed with flavor. Even the rice was good on its own. The salmon belly soup was a big portion. It had many pieces of the melt in your mouth salmon belly, bits of tofu, wakame and mushrooms and something like dong fen (mung bean thread noodle). So maybe I have been ordering the wrong stuff at Sushi Tei. What I had was pretty much value for money too.",

The place exuded a cosy vibe with dim lighting and dark interior furniture. Our group was seated into a booth. It was my first dining experience at Sushi Tei. The one dish I remembered clearly eating and indulging in was the crispy fried white bait. It was so savoury and addictive, we had to order another. The rest of the dishes were the usual Japanese fare like the California Roll and Sashimi. Although I can't recall them as vividly, I definitely remembered feeling very satisfied after the whole meal I could barely walk. The whole affair lasted for more than two hours. I know that because I had to later scurry off towards Cineleisure to catch a pre-booked movie with another friend.",

Every visit i go, i never fail to order this. Crispy prawn covered with rice with a layer of juicy mango and roe. Not forgetting to mention my another favourite dish, sukiya. Though the soup base is abit too sweet and salty at times, i still love it to the max. My only disappointment with Sushi Tei is that it has increased its price tremendously over the yearsSushi Tei does not allow reservation. Hence, please go there earlier in order to avoid the queue.",

    "text": "\"Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Streeeeet~~~\"That's the lyrics of Sesame Street, it's relevant to this review because for me, the magic of Sushi Tei is in its SESAME SAUCE. Whenever I dine at Sushi Tei, I'll consciously tell myself, stop ordering their sesame based dishes! But I can't do it. Blame it on the Charles Xavier inside my head who can't resist their sesame dressing. It is sweet and savoury at the same time, nutty and appetising, and leaves a delectable after-taste to the palate.Their menu will tell you which dishes are made with sesame sauce base. I've tried the cold ramen salad (yes), the dry noodles sesame something (yes). Pardon me for I'm bad with Japanese dish names; I only know the paper-pot soup is called kaminabe.The waffles are great. If you can tell from the picture, it is cut up neatly into portions for your convenience. It is unlike other waffles where everything goes drippy drip and all you have on the other end of the fork is a gooey mash (not that it's a bad thing though). The style of the waffles here is clean and sophisticated; you can pick it up with your fingers to bite into that soft crunchy icy goodness. Mmmm.I like the layout of the outlet at Paragon. Try to get the booth seats facing the windows overlooking Orchard Road.",

When friends are late I always amuse myself by sipping hot Ocha and just watching people bustling about their affairs. However, the main reason why I always come back is because they have a very good range of Japanese food, each type of which they make really well, so whenever I go there I am never pressured to pick their sushi because it is their speciality. Their sushi being well made aside, I must say my personal favourite is the sashimi salad which always seems like the mandatory order for every table. The servings of sashimi is ever generous, and it comes with a choice of three sauces: their own made wafuu salad dressing, sesame dressing, and another type which did not look too appetizing to me. My favourite is the sesame dressing although the most popular there is the wafuu salad dressing. To me, it is a little too bland to be eating bland lettuce with., so I always go for the sesame option. That salad has become \u00a0a staple in my weekly diet. It's healthy yet satisfying at the same time, hence dubbed by me as a rare and wonderfully healthy option.",

Service is usually pretty competent, and it's hard to resist the sushi on the conveyor belt that whizzes by you. Be warned though - as fun as grabbing the sushi off the belt is, the price does add up. And it's easy to end up with 10 plates in front of you before you really realise what's happening. The outlet at Paragon is massive, and it overlooks busy Orchard Road so it's a good place to rest your feet at after a busy day of shopping. The Paragon outlet is pretty nicely done up to match its location, and it's probably one of the better Sushi Tei outlets in Singapore.",

    "text": "Sushi Tei, one of my first few experiences with Japanese food in Singapore when I was much younger. Always being fascinated by trains, I enjoyed the whole food conveyor belt that ran around the whole restaurant. Although that is not what I look forward to so much these days, it does bring back fond memories. Sushi Tei is one of the few belt sushi joints that offer better and fresher food as opposed to its counterparts like Sakae Sushi. I usually dive into the Salmon Belly sushi and the Tempura Prawn hand rolls which have been staples on the menus for as long as I remember. The kitchen also offers grilled foods and a must try is the Grilled Cod in Teriyaki \u00a0sauce accompanied with Japanese ginger! Be prepared to queue on the weekends!",
