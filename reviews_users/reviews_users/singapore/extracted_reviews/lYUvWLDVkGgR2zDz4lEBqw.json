Savory, just the right salty, and tons of meat in the crab. I got the Sri Lanka crab, but if you have the budget, there's Alaskan King as well. The service was wonderful. Checked on me several times. I'm so glad I took them up on their offer to tie a bib on me. :)They were upfront on the pricing. It's listed on the menu and they worked with me to find a crab and weight/kg that was ok for me.Great view, sitting right on the water looking at the river and Marina Bay Sands.",

Come to find out after all the research. \u00a0Tian Tian seafood restuarant uses the same menu from the old Forum seafood restuarant that was shut down for scamming tourists a couple of years back. \u00a0Same owners same operation, different name. Google forum seafood in Singapore and you will see the scams being pulled on hardworking tourists. \u00a0Im 100% certain these are the same crooks.Here is the link: \u00a0mothership.sg/2014/05/to\u2026",

There was trash strewn around the floor (napkins and wet towel wrappers) no one had any interest in picking up during the 2 hours we were there (yes 2 hours just to get an entr\u00e9e). \u00a0The trash issue was particularly bad as it all ends up in the river the restaurant sits on. \u00a0My Pad Thai was brought out long before my husband's $72 chili crab (which they said was the smallest they had). \u00a0So my Pad Thai was cold by the time they brought my husband's dinner (and they weren't very busy this evening either, they just have no interest in good service). \u00a0I asked for lime for the Pad Thai as was shown on the menu but they only had lemon. \u00a0When they brought the chili crab, my husband had to ask for a crab cracker (I'm not really sure how they thought he could eat a whole crab without a crab cracker). \u00a0I had to actually get up and ask for a fork TWICE! \u00a0Later my husband had to get up and hunt someone down to ask for the bill. \u00a0Then he had to get up and deliver the bill to them. \u00a0If you're counting, that's 4 times we had to get up and round up a server. \u00a0 To go with the $72 crab they suggested 2 small buns for which they charged $4. \u00a0They couldn't even provide bread with a $72 crab! \u00a0Then they also charged us .60 cents for the wet wipes for after eating a crab in googey sauce with your hands. \u00a0To top it all off, the Pad Thai was among the worst I've had but what did I expect for $26 on a plastic plate? \u00a0The ONLY good things were 1. the Chili Crab was good and 2. they offered a \"free\" Welcome Drink. But THAT was it, everything else was awful.",

The food served always looks good & well presented, but the seafood is far higher than similar restaurants. Local dishes on the contrary, are not priced as high & provide better value.",

The price is by grams so don't be fooled by their 50% discount because even with the discount, each item will easily break $100+. Water is tap and their service is horrible.

I then walked back to my table, picked up my plate of crab with the entire shell body of the crab we ate and showed her how much smaller it was. She said she would charge us 1.25kg each and I said no way. I asked to weigh the smallest crab they had on display, and it weighed 1.1kg and it was bigger than both of the crabs we ate. I then inspected their scale and I showed them that it was not set correctly and that it was weighing heavier than it should, they denied it, and I had to blatantly point it out to them. \u00a0I asked them how many other customers they had done this too and they did not answer. \u00a0They charged me for .8kg each and they acted like they were doing me a favor.
