    "text": "This place is simply divine. Every single dessert here is super creative and elegantly made. Their gelato flavors were so interesting, many of which I have never seen in the United States. Their main course desserts are so beautiful, I just want to admire them rather than eat them. That would be a mistake though, because they are very delicious. We got their Ike main course, which is kanji for pond. The dish is presented as a koi pond, and it almost brought a single tear to my eye looking at this work of art. We also got an Almond and coconut cake that looked as though it had pandan in the center. I couldn't really detect by taste, what the center was, but it was delicious. Lastly, we got two scoops of gelato: white rabbit candy and kaya toast. The white rabbit candy stood out the most only because of its nostalgia. I imagined dissolvable rice papers with each bite lol If we didn't want to try other places during our stay, I would eat here every night and try each menu item. I really enjoyed this place.",

    "text": "5 stars for aesthetic, 4 for taste. The desserts are literal pieces of art. Here's what I tried:- Rubber Ducky (5 stars for taste and aesthetic). It was adorable and the flavor of lemon (?) and mango was perfect together. I think the inside was gelato and it was really good and very impressive they could get it to keep its shape. Nothing I didn't like about this one. So cute and delicious.- Ike, which is the edible koi pond (3 stars for taste, 5 stars for aesthetic). It's seriously beautiful, but I wasn't a huge fan of the taste. Black sesame is an acquired taste for sure and I haven't quite gotten to the point of liking it yet. It was really strong and a bit overpowering. The jelly fish is also very strongly flavored, a bit too much for me. I did really like the mochi though, since matcha is an acquired flavor that I have acquired :) Basically, if you're not a huge fan of sweet things, this is your dessert. For me, I'd rather have something sweeter. - Amethyst Brew, which is butterfly pea tea (4 stars for taste and aesthetic). It has a thin slice of cucumber in it, which is one of my favorite foods. Surprisingly, the flavor of the tea and the cucumber go well together. Overall, there's something for everyone here, even if you're just there to get an impressive Instagram shot. I would definitely come back and try more of the picturesque desserts.",

I love the atmosphere, an old school dessert joint, but all their dessert options are definitely quirky and fun. We tried the dessert that looked like nasi lemak with real ikan bilis, and kaya toast with authentic salt and pepper shakers. We were pleasantly surprised with the execution, we ended up packing some more to bring to my parents who weren't able to make it. They had gelatos you can sample, wish we had more room in our stomach for the gula melaka one! A little pricey but for the creativity and labor put into each dessert, I think it's definitely worth a visit.",

We settled for a Speculoos Avalanche (lava cake) and the \"Le Bliss\" cake (containing raspberry yogurt, yuzu and earl grey, so I couldn't refuse). Everything was delicious albeit a bit pricey. I liked that they also provided water for free, because it's definitely necessary to go along with desserts. The desserts weren't too sweet, and very tasty, but somehow just didn't blow me away. The earl grey could have been stronger in the bliss cake. The Speculoos lava cake was good, and definitely a visual spectacle to see the lava dripping down into the cup, but it just seemed a bit gimmicky and pricey for what it was. Maybe next time I'll be able to try one of their signatures to update this review!",

My friend got the Singapore breakfast and my brother got the Speculoos Avalanche. For how beautifully the desserts are presented, I was a little disappointed by the taste. The standout dessert was the Speculoos, and I watched jealously as my brother devoured the whole thing.My problem with the Rubber Ducky was how the tastes were not balanced. It's overwhelmingly citrus-y and could do with the addition of a contrasting flavor to offset the lemon. I had to eat the dessert very slowly just to stop my mouth from screwing up.",

    "text": "Entry level (non) Entr\u00e9e. I'll be honest. I couldn't be happier when I heard about Non Entr\u00e9e Desserts. Something new, something exciting. Something to give a place like 2 a.m. dessert bar a run for its money. Located in a quite corner of Rangoon road, right next to the famous Ng Ah Sio Bah Kut Teh, Non Entr\u00e9e desserts clearly stands out as one of kind in a location better known for its Bah Kut Tehs and wholesalers. Looking at their menu, we were throughly excited. We took a while to get there unfortunately, thanks to me brilliant mind that somehow translated Rangoon road to race course road, sending us into the wrong direction and wasting a good 30 mins. Upon arriving, we were greeted by a nice, cosy looking dessert cafe. The bright yellow paint job at the entrance meant it was really hard to miss. We looked at the menu and unfortunately, our first choice of Tropicana was unavailable. Probably because we got there pretty late. We decided to play it safe with a waffle and \"Exotic\" flavored ice cream. Looking over at their cake display, and being a sucker for white chocolate, I couldn't help but order their White forest, even though I'm not a big Black Forest (or fruit) fan by nature but it was too pretty to resist. We decided to wash it down with a very interesting strawberry shortcake tea. White Forest Cake While this was a very pretty cake, no denying.. It was unfortunately very very flat for me. Maybe it was the lack of chocolate, or maybe it was the lack of brandy in the cherries but there seemed to be a distinctive lack of depth and harmony in the cake. Bluntly put, it was really just sweet on sweet on sweet to a point it was almost overbearing (and this is coming from a white chocolate fan). Waffle and \"Exotic\" ice cream.We didn't ask what flavour the ice cream was made of but judging by the colour and name, we figured it'd be either a mango or passion fruit base... And we weren't wrong. While the ice cream was decent, it was again a little to sweet for our liking. Again.. It lacked that added depth we would have expected from an ice cream named exotic and left an after taste in our mouths that killed all ability to taste the actual waffle (which thankfully we tried prior to eating the ice cream).The waffle itself was well. A little bit of a let down. While it wasn't particularly bad, it did fail a bit when compared to some of our other favorite waffles. Again... Not bad.. Just.. Pretty normal. Strawberry shortcake tea Now this was a good way to wash down our desserts and thank goodness for it. The tea was fragrant with that slight bitterness you'd expect from a strawberry and it certainly help wash down the overpowering sweetness from the White forest and ice cream. What I will say though is that, this review wouldn't be a fair judgement without trying their signature desserts. We're willing to head back for a second try but at $11.90 to $16.90 for their main desserts, we're hoping it raises the bar and the impression we have of the place so far, if not, we might just find ourselves heading next door to wash down the sweetness with a hot, peppery bowl of Bah Kut Teh.",

What a smart thing to open a cafe right next to a famous local food place! Coffee was good (3 stars). Dessert looks really good (in terms of look). Taste wise, I think that the chocolate avalanche is actually too sweet for my liking. The duckling dessert looks AMAZINGLY cute, but I didn't have the stomach to try it. Perhaps, I will try it if I go to bkt again for lunch and if you are prepared to wait for a table as they are pretty filled up on the weekends.

Don't get me wrong, they taste pretty good... but that's being balanced against the reality that they look stunning.I went with in a group of five, and ordered the Chocolate Avalanche, the Tropicana, the Pick Me Up, and Le Citron. All of them were tasty, though none were spectacular. But to be fair, I wasn't expecting spectacular. The prices are nearly half of what 2 a.m. charges, and to be quite frank, 2 a.m. isn't \"nearly twice as good\". So overall, the desserts are well crafted and affordable, the vibe is energetic, welcoming, and casual. I found my \"meal\" here very enjoyable, and I've been very happy to recommend it to friends and colleagues alike.Go in with reasonable expectations; it's a casual dessert place serving fancy dessert fare. Don't over think it.PS: Why four stars? I feel Non Entree deserves credit for attempting to do what Saveur did for French cuisine. Taking \"high end\" concepts and making them affordable and accessible. If that doesn't deserve a star, I don't know what should!",
