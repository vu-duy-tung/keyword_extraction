    "text": "Overall, I'm rather satisfied with my meal here. The two star rating really is because it's not my first choice for forking out $22-24 for a main course. The price point simply doesn't make sense for a place that looks like a simple cafe. If this place was a little fancier, I would give it another star. The chilli crab linguine was good - the tomato sauce had just the right amount of spiciness to it and there was plenty of shredded crab meat to accompany the pasta. However, I found myself having too much crabmeat and sauce remaining (which honestly isn't a bad thing considering that it reflects well that there's more than enough of the important ingredient - crab). So Marmalade Pantry, please don't reduce the amount of crabmeat/sauce (you're doing great justice to the price of the dish), just give more pasta (which I'm sure costs you nothing) and doing so will only impress your customers considering the large portion of the dish. The mushroom risotto was creamy and definitely \"truffly\". There was just the right amount of mushroom in each bite. The done-ness of the rice was just right too. I was initially hesitant about ordering the dish because I've read that the portion is small, but as a girl, I think it just managed to hit the \"satisfied\" level. I found the cupcake we ordered okay, but my friend raved about it. So perhaps I didn't think much about the cupcake because I've been spoiled with the best cupcakes names in the US, and this one just failed to impress compared to them.The ginger pudding was soft and warm, and the caramel ice cream that accompanied it was clearly speckled with vanilla. I would order it again.All in all, I would be willing to visit Marmalade Pantry again and would also order these items again if I had to eat here.",

    "text": "There seems to be a lack of chic food places at Ion, so I always end up at Marmalade Pantry. Went there again for dinner this time, and I had a wonderful meal!The service was really prompt, especially this waiter with a cool haircut who was really enthusiastic and warm, and made us feel very comfortable.My boyfriend had the Crabmeat Linguine, which was good! I felt like it was too watery though, and I maintain that the best crabmeat linguine pasta I've ever had was elsewhere... (see my blog on my profile)... but it was still delicious by normal standards. It has an abundance of real actual crabmeat and not like faux crab or crabsticks so it's still worth it for the price at $24.(The previous time I came here, I tried the Seared Scallop Linguine ($24) and it was super delicious! The crabmeat one is tomato-based, but this one is more like a broth and it's quite savory? I kinda prefer this more cos I like special pastas that I can't get elsewhere!) The milkshake was good but also too watery for me... hahaha oops what's with me not liking watery food?? The best cookies and cream milkshake we've had is also from elsewhere (check my blog) but Marmalade Pantry's is pretty good!So I had the Pantry Club ($20) sandwich which was reaaaally good. I think when my food came my boyfriend's eyes popped, you know like Popeye when he sees his girlfriend or something. It's quite a simple chicken ham egg sandwich but it just looks so appealing!! It also comes with a side of like... healthy vegetable chips? I really love them!!! Of course I couldn't finish it (there were 4 mini sandwiches) and my boyfriend got to eat one :) score for him!Finally, we shared a Caramelized Pear and Salted Caramel Bread Pudding for dessert! The bread pudding is wrapped in some kind of crispy filo puff and okay wow it was so yummy!!! It went perfectly with the ice cream and the salted caramel sauce - perfectly sweet and salty at the same time.So maybe that's why I keep coming back to Marmalade Pantry, because for the price we get a good meal! The portions are big enough for people with small appetites to share. Their desserts are also good so this place is good for tea with friends too :)Please check out my blog (on my profile) for photos! :)",

The ordering experience involved standing outside the shop to read the display menu while yelling each obscure cupcake name (earl?) through the doorway hoping the cashier heard me through the noise of the mall. Really? No printed menu for me to look at inside? There is also no display of cupcakes- you're \u00a0standing in a dark hallway.The outdoor seating looked cute however. Maybe this is a better experience if you eat in.",

Service is good and fast, the waitstaff are great at taking orders and the food doesn't take too long to come. I also like that since its not in a confined space, the noise level is kept very low and you can actually hold a conversation no matter how crowded it gets.I'm a risotto freak and usually not hard to please, but I found the mushroom risotto here a tad too salty for my liking. It was served in a good portion, there were plenty of mushrooms in there, and the grains were cooked to al-dente perfection. I think it would have been just fine without the cheese. I've also tried several of their cupcakes, and found them to be pretty decent. The cake has just the right moisture to hold it together, but at the same time is not too dense.This is a perfect place if you want to have a good dinner at a fairly reasonable price!",

A main to try would definitely be the crabmeat linguine, served with a generous portion of crabmeat, pine nuts and just the right amount of chilli to add some spice to the dish. If you're looking for a healthy alternative, do give the king salmon and soba a go. To end the meal, do try one of their famous cupcakes, the red velvet is a crowd favorite with a deep red color, cream cheese and coconut shavings.",

    "text": "good, better-than-average bistro food at this branch of the yummy-mummy chain in the ion shopping mall. the food is pretty decent, the prices competitive for the area, and there aren't much better options around for a place to sit down and have some cake and tea.it's pretty flabbergasting to realize that though the orchard road precinct is hangout-de-rigueur for most people on the weekends, and so ought to (and does) have a slew of eateries, there really isn't much to eat around there, just a whole lot of overly expensive sit-down places or trendy takeaway options. this place remains my fall-back option when I'm out with the girlfriends, and has been since I first visited their palais renaissance outlet nearly five years ago.the food may not be spectacularly surprising, but it is reliable and very enjoyable. the menu runs the gamut of european-fusion-ish bistro dishes: easy brunch food, salads and sandwiches, proper entr\u00e9es and pud. I tend to come here for brunch or tea, and so the menu does me well - don't come expecting a formal dinner service here, it ain't that sort place.truth be told though, \u00a0my constant visits are for their sweets. they have the same sort of style as the p.s. cafe chain (and both do a mean sticky date pudding). I got to try something new this time: their caramelized pear and salted caramel bread pudding. doesn't that sound fantastic! and it really was intriguing - two rectangular slabs of bread pudding wrapped with filo, baked to a pale golden, and topped with a scoop of delicious vanilla ice cream. the filo was a little floury - I think it could have been baked a little longer, or brushed with an egg wash - but I'm quibbling: that bare drizzle of salted caramel on the plate was just the right accent to the pud - it was a great way to finish the meal.",

    "text": "Marmalade Pantry at ION is a really convenient place for lunch in Orchard or catching up over a cupcake or three. Food : LOVE the chilli crab linguine with pine nuts. I've tried this dish at other restaurants but Marmalade Pantry still does the best version. The portion is just right and it's not too spicy, while the pine nuts add a nice texture to the al dente linguine with generous helpings of crab meat. Being partial to seafood, the lighter option of crab Caesar salad with parmesan and pine nuts was also pretty good! I personally like the William Pear and Limonata cupcakes for dessert while some friends love MP's sticky date and toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream. Good selection of bites for afternoon tea.Ambience : Casual chi-chi and one of those yuppie / tai-tai go-to places for teaService : Hit and miss. We've been there when the service staff behave as if they couldn't care less for our business, but there have also been occasions where our wait staff was really pleasant and efficient. Your experience really depends on the waiter serving you.Unfortunately Marmalade Pantry does the best version of the chilli crab linguine in Singapore despite its slightly steep pricing and sketchy service, so I go when the craving hits.",

Portions are not huge, but I guess thats good if you want to have dessert. Do not try the high tea. Not worth it. And not good at all. Back to the cupcakes. With the trend of cupcakes finally picking up in Singapore, Id have to say that Marmalade Pantry still holds the title for the best so far. The cupcakes are bigger than other places here. The flavors are awesome. My favorite is the Elvis cupcake-- chocolate, banana and peanut butter. Amazing. I also really like the coconut with cream cheese frosting and sprinkles.

BOY did I come out even more disappointed after trying out this place.First of all, there needs to be something done with the staff. All of them were rude and didn't seem like they wanted to be there. None of them nicely greeted my friend nor I. I raised my hands so many times throughout my meal and all the workers would just be looking down and be too into the zone when setting up or cleaning the tables. Do they not have any sense of peripheral vision and not see someone vigorously waving their hang trying to grab your attention?? My friend and I shared between the Spicy Crab Pasta ($24) and Truffle Field Mushroom Pasta ($24). The food was pretty decent but I just can't justify why the price was so expensive. The restaurant is in the middle of a mall so I don't see a reason of having to spend so much on a meal. I gave this place 3 stars and that's already pushing it. If it wasn't for the carrot cake (which was amazingly moist and not overly sweet), this place would of easily only gotten 2 stars.",

The food took a good 15 minutes arrive (just starters!) \u00a0and the bill took 20 minutes to come, and another 15 to be processed.

A patch of rocket leaves were drenched with overly sweet dressing. Muffins were flat and tasted like it was baked elsewhere and brought to the kitchen. For $18, I expect more. I could do a better Eggs Benedict. Also ordered Americano which tasted like it came out of my coffee machine at home. It's not bad, just not great. Marmalade Pantry, what happened to you?",

What we had: - Crabmeat linguine is still good with plentiful of fresh crabmeat in a toothsome tomato based sauce, pine nuts and chili. The pasta is robust with strong flavor and the pine nuts add a nutty dimension to the overall taste.- Seared scallop linguine in a prawn bisque is a bit bland. The scallops are quite sad looking, maybe I am expecting big, thick juicy lightly seared scallops where you can still see the white with charred edges and not scallops which blend in with the pasta. The prawn bisque is quite light flavored. A nice touch is the sprinkling of tiny dried shrimps over the pasta.- Crab caesar salad is also good with a generous serving of crabmeat and pine nuts over fresh greens.- Sea salt caramel cheesecake is pretty much like a regular cheesecake with some bits being very salty. Not sure where the caramel is though, maybe just lightly glazed at the top. - Eton Mess is pure cream, or at least it seemed like it. Very heavy cream (not sweet) layered with berries. It is the prettiest dessert but the taste is nothing to be wowed.- Ice lemon tea is freshly made and good. Refreshing.- Milkshake (horlicks and double chocolate) is great. Not too thick that it is hard to suck up nor is it too runny that you feel like you are drinking milk. Marmalade Pantry is still crowded, especially for dinners and weekends/public holidays so I guess the food is not overly bad. I would just stick to the few classic dishes which are safe choices.",

Firstly, the food was so-so... the tea well.. nothing special as well.. the cupcake I had was a pear chocolate one which was an interesting and delightful combination. When the bill came... we found out the price was quite a fair bit (I am not gonna mention the price as I can't quite remember the total bill but I remembered it was about 100++ there about). We felt it was really not worth it and there was also some miscommunication between us and the waiting staff which made the experience pretty terrible. After settling the bill, all of us decided for the experience and for the price... this place really is not a worth the price to come back for high tea... and since then I haven't had the motivation to go back to try their lunch or dinner sets.",

Service is fine, smoothies are pretty good (but $11!). Kitchen is located away from the main seating area so food is pretty cooled down by the time it gets to the table.Just don't bother.",

They also serve their tea with the usual apparatus - loose-leafed and in an infuser and a mini-colander to sieve the leaves out - pretty chic and nothing to complain about.Coffee's nothing rave-worthy, service is average, prices are a little bit high, but like I said - a good safe haven from the swarms of people below - and almost a 'place to be seen' with a book in hand (though its too dark too read there).",

The quiet and classy ambience makes it a pretty good place to meet up with friends over tea and cake in convenient Orchard. There is this one particular waiter that was very patient in taking my order (I took a really long time to choose my food) and entertained my friends with his jokes that subtlety highlighted and made recommendations of the cafe's specialties. \u00a0Must try: Lemon meringue sponge cake- the outer meringue is light, fluffy and slightly caramelized. -- reminds me of bbq marshmallows but lighter! \u00a0The inner sponge cake is baked to just the right amount of softness .Try at your own risk: Cinnamon spiced apple cake- this cake is way too thick in texture for my liking!",

    "text": "Marmalade Pantry is the kind of place you go to for a tai tai lunch, or for cakes and high tea. I remember often stopping by for exactly that, while they were still at Palais Renaissance. Since they have moved to Ion, however, though way more accessible, the crowd now consists more of shoppers taking a break from shopping and tourists. Not that that's necessarily bad, no. It's just that, I feel like part of the appeal of the place was that it was a quiet chichi haven, to unwind over cakes and coffee in a little mall that didn't get much traffic. Still, I guess you could look at it both ways as the open concept gives you a chance to take a break from shopping and people watch (if that's what you're into). Moving onto the food, the food is okay. Definitely not bad, but not fantastic. I like their pastas and they'll do when I want a quick meal but it's not quite something I crave and make a trip specially to Ion for. The cupcakes, on the other hand, are a different story. They little babies, I WOULD travel for. I guess everyone has their favorites but Marmalade Pantry's cupcakes still remain high on my list of favs. Some of my fav flavors here include William (the chocolate cupcake with pear filling and vanilla buttermilk frosting), the PB Chocolate one as well as the Nutella one. I also especially like their Mango Cookie (its kind of a shortbread melt-in-your-mount crumbly textured cookie, the size of your hand) The deco is minimal and service is alright. Best thing about it is probably the cupcakes (:",

And honestly, I don't know why in Singapore these type of establishments are so popular. A nation that prides itself on food, is really meh when it comes it anything non-asian. There's nothing wrong or particularly bad about the service or food, but with a little more effort than putting on my shorts, I could have made the same food if not better with a hangover. I rate the food slightly below my college cafeteria, granted we had an awesome dining hall. \u00a0I ordered latte, earl grey, 2 omelettes, and a banana hotcake and it comes out to 77 dollars! Okay, I get you have to mark it up because it's western and it's in Ion and yes it's popular, but seriously, even by Singapore pricing standards, this is plainly not worth the money.  Like I said, nothing wrong with the place, but for 80 bucks, why would you?",

The bad: You know when you crave for a particular type of food, but can't find it, so you eat something else? \u00a0That's what this place is like. Doesn't hit the spot, but it won't leave you completely unsatisfied. The ugly: Service is spotty and its not a great bang for you buck. But hey, its Ion, what do you expect? They are fast, but incredibly inconsistent. I asked for no mushrooms with my eggs and got a tower of shrooms. Then requested salt, pepper and ketchup, to which I got none. Ordered a caramel latte which tasted completely different from the first time I went. When I asked about it they brought my original cup back with heaps of caramel. \u00a0Candy latte? \u00a0Gross. Guy next to me got shut down trying to order off the kids menu, then the manager came over and told him its a no go. Guy left incredibly pissed off. Stick to the cupcakes.",

    "text": "We have been here twice in the past 2 months and both times were not very good. \u00a0Visit #1 was for a Sunday lunch with 5 friends. \u00a0We all ordered different things, and the consensus was for the price that the food was below average to average. \u00a0I ordered the hamburger where the meat was round like a meatball and not a flat patty. It didn't fit the bun and I ended up having to eat it with a knife and fork. \u00a0Really ruined the burger for me. \u00a0 Maybe the Meatball shape is their attempt at a \"high end\" burger, but it really says that they don't understand the makings of a good burger. Service was prompt. \u00a0After we ordered our drinks - \u00a03 additional servers (one after the other) stopped and interrupted our conversation to take our drink orders. When the third one stopped, I honestly started to suspect we might be on a hidden camera tv show. \u00a0Visit #2: \u00a0A group of 5 friends and I went in before closing for dessert and coffee. \u00a0As is often the case here, many of the desserts had finished. \u00a0I opted for the Oreo Milkshake. ($9) \u00a0I am not trying to be humorous or stretch the truth - but the Milkshake had absolutely no ice cream. \u00a0None! \u00a0It was sweet from the Oreo cookie, but was as thin as milk and served at room temperature. \u00a0Two of my friends also had milkshakes and said theirs were the same. \u00a0Thin and warm. The Good: Maybe there is something this restaurant does good, but I never found it.The Bad: \u00a0After 4 visits in total over the past 2 years, I can't think of a single reason to recommend The Marmalade Pantry. \u00a0The Verdict: \u00a0Unless I am suddenly in the mood for a $9 glass of milk, I won't be returning. \u00a0One and a half stars..",
