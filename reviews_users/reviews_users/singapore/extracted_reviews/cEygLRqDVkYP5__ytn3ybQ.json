    "text": "This is one of my favorite hawker dishes and the fact that it is walking distance (when it's not superhot) from my house makes it even better. I always go for a number 1, 15$, dry, yellow noodles and have never been disappointed with this combo of delicious shrimp & pork rib broth and springy noodles with chili. The shrimp are just super juicy and the chili is super yum!The only downside is the ever-present long line jn front of the stall (which proves that I am not the only fan), but luckily it moves relatively quick - unlike the line for Nasi Lemak. It's one of the only places in Singapore where I am willing to wait for my food so may I say: SHIOK!!Recommended!",

They had well in producing the soup.The prawns were fresh to the taste and the chef slice it into half potion which is excellent as less mess to peel the shell if in its whole.Don't forget the chilli powder if you like it spicy like me.Kudos to the chef.4 Star!....cos it's a bit X for hawker food.Cheers.",

Unfortunately, the last time I was here, I was severely disappointed. I like my bee hoon dry, it has nice amounts of lard but at times it was a bit too sweet. The broth used to be rich with Unami flavours but previously was bland and light. So why do I still give it 3 stars? I \u00a0still holding on to the belief that perhaps it was an off day, as I would be sorely disappointed if their standards has dropped to such levels.",

Nothing very special and I've had much better at other unknown prawn noodle places. Not very generous portions of prawns and I've had much better broths in other places. I tried it again thinking the first time was a fluke. However, the second try was similar. That would be the last try.",

    "text": "Usually when I go to zion market, bak kut teh is on my mind. But having always heard about the famous prawn noodles that has invaded Zion Market, decided to give it a try the other day. Had a hard time looking for it because the stall was not opened yet and ironically there was another prawn noodle stall beside it. Fortunately, the stall was preparing to open at 12noon and already a queue had formed for it outside its half-opened shutters. Though I'm not a person to succumb to queueing, since I was at the head of the line, I decided to wait. Although the shutters came up at 12, you still have to wait while the guy prepared. And after all that wait? Was it worth it? Well, it was alright. Good soup, nice prawns, nice pork, definitely one of the better ones in Singapore. But was it worth the wait and hype? Probably not. Will I try it again? only if there isn't anybody queueing.",

    "text": "The prawn mee here has never really blew my mind, but I like it for the fact that the strandard is always pretty consistent, the service is not too bad for a stall this famous, and the portion is just right. Unlike many other prawn mee stalls the aunty gives you the option of having purely bee hoon (as opposed to bee hoon+noodles), which I really appreciate. I like that the bowls come in different sizes in reasonable portions, and that even though they are not exactly generous with their prawns, the prawns are at least very fresh and partially peeled.My standard dish is prawn noodles with pork slices. The broth is very flavorful, and it doesn't leave me very thirsty after drinking the entire bowl so Id like to think that it is not that unhealthy.... The stall also sells fish cake, which the aunty sometimes encourages you to buy, but I personally don't find it that delicious. The prawn mee is best taken with a generous amount of chilli powder. Truly a shiok experience.",

There will be queues, though not to the lengths you'll find lined up for Nasi Lemak. The main thing about this place is how well cooked the broth is - always so full of flavour, steeped in its pork and prawn combination after hours of boiling. For this reason, always get this in soup form, not dry! The prawns have also never let me down, both in size and in freshness, and the noodles are also always cooked very well.A bowl doesn't seem to be very filling, but it does keep me very happy! Always miss this when I'm away.",

Best time to get around there to having your bowl of prawn noodles is around 8pm, where the broth has nicely matured with a rich taste of prawn. I usually go for the $8 portion, nice amount of prawns with some pork bits on bone. Yum.",

    "text": "Great Prawn Mee/Noodles but stingy on the ingredients. Similar to other reviews the broth is rich and captures all the essence of pork ribs and prawns. If you're lucky, you could get a side order or crab as well to go along with your Prawn Mee/Noodles. The crabs are usually proudly displayed at the stall window if and when available. The only downside for me is that the prawns are not given whole instead they are cut in half. It makes it easier to remove the prawns from the shells this way but I personally think it is a trick to make it seem like they gave you 4 prawns when in actual fact it is just 2 miserable prawns. And yes despite all, a \u00a0queue may stand in your way!",

    "text": "Super yummy prawn noodles. The prawns are big and fresh - and I especially like that they are half peeled. The one thing that puts me off ordering dishes that contain prawns at hawker centers is the mess of peeling the shell. So this stall gets a star just for that. Another star goes to the soup. Granted, the standard does fluctuate a bit, but my advice is to go there in the late afternoon when the stock has had enough time to simmer and gain that intense prawn flavor. One note though - they could be more generous with their prawns, but hey. I think the stock more than makes up for it.",
