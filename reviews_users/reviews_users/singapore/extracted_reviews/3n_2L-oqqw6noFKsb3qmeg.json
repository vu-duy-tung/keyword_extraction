    "text": "The place was packed for lunch during Saturday. I decided on the omakase lunch which was consisted of 7 courses (S$97++). My only request was the dessert not to be the restaurant's signature Wild Rocket Chendol which I just had a couple of weeks ago. Ice water was served after placing order.Course 1 : Bah Chor MeeNegitoro (minced fatty tuna) topped with chopped spring onion and chilli padi, crispy lards, fried shallots, on top of a bed of warm glass noodles.Course 2 : Thai Pomelo SaladServed with tiger prawns & frozen coconut dressingThe dressing was like a scoop of ice cream and made of coconut, chilli, fish oil, and shallot. It tasted quite lemak. Having it with mint leaf, pomelo, and cilantro, it tasted quite refreshing with hint of spicy and sweetness of fruit. Course 3 : Chilli CrabCrab cake made of blue crab and spanner crab, served with chilli crab sauce.The crab cake was packed with nothing but crab meat. Quite juicy and yummy on its own.Course 4 : Hokkien MeeFresh pasta cooked with prawn stock, and hae ko (black shrimp paste). It was quite flavourful but a bit too salty for me.Course 5 : Wild Rocket Strawberry CheesecakeIt served deconstructed style in a Martini glass. Creamy without too sweet or sour.I was surprised that I was served dessert before my main. I later asked the staff who thought I already had it. In the end I went through what I had with 2 different staffs and decided that there was 2 more courses.Course 6 : Black vinegar iberico pork jowl with pickled cabbage and chestnut pureeThe meat was quite tender and pulled out easily. Quite appetizing with the pickled vegetables.Course 7 : Lychee sorbet with lychee martini gummyThe sorbet was topped with ginger flower and blue pea flower. Interesting flavours of the light lychee and the slightly stronger ginger flower. Quite refreshing.Overall the food was not bad but was a tab upset about my course of dishes being overlooked. By the way as the place was full house, it was quite noisy too.",

Had the 9 course tasting menu (two of us, two alcoholic drinks for total of S$340 after taxes and pluses). Enjoyed the last few dishes (Eg hokkien mee, pesto laksa, desserts of chendol (deconstructed)). But the first few dishes were somewhat amateurish, cooking school type. Restaurant wasn't exactly sophisticated; it amplified conversations into raucous sounds. Lighting was awful. Was good to try some dishes again but I should have chosen somewhere else for dinner!",

    "text": "Hate giving this low of a review to any place but this is one of the few times I've walked out of a restaurant quite disappointed by the awful flavors of every dish we received. Everything is subjective and all restaurants have bad days which is fine but I just can't justify going back to a place like this after the experience we had.The restaurant is out of the way inside of a budget hotel/hostel. After walking inside the hotel/hostel doors, you can make your way through the Wild Rocket entrance and into the small and intimate (and awesomely decorated) interior. Really good music playing too, we were pumped.My girlfriend and I came in for a later weekday evening dinner and ordered a la carte since none of the mains looked appealing in the four course menu (and the omakase wasn't available unless you book in advance since the head chef needs to be present to serve it).We ordered the following:1) Pomelo Salad with tiger prawns and frozen coconut dressing - Easy starter but the frozen coconut dressing (I think the waitress might have said blue cheese as well) was a bit too heavy. It was the only item that we did finish though.2) Salmon Belly Red Rice and Baby Octopus donburi - The red rice, although oily, was worth eating but the fish wasn't. It had a very fishy flavor like it wasn't cooked all the way.3) Laksa pesto linguini with king prawn - Who can resist a linguini dish that is made with \"Laksa Pesto\"?? We were told that so many customers loved this dish so much that they constantly requested that the chef put it back on his menu. Unfortunately for both of us, the pasta tasted awful. It tasted like an overly peppered and dry pasta dish. Both myself and my girlfriend (born and raised Singaporean) couldn't even taste the slightest bit of laksa in the pasta. The king prawn was fantastic however. We ate that and left the entire pasta.4) Thai Basil Minced Pork Bee Tai Mak with Onsen egg - Just awful. The meat tasted like cheap ground beef that you can find in a fast food restaurant. Nothing here tasted good, we both took a bite and left the entire dish. 5) Teh Tarik panna cotta with pearls - It was a good effort but I wish they did something else instead of panna cotta. The pearls are identical to those you would find in a bubble tea (they give you four pearls) and the teh tarik tastes extremely sweet. I feel this was too easy a dessert to make without much creativity.6) Pineapple dark chocolate tart - This is pretty much what you can expect a pineapple dark chocolate tart to taste like. Nothing special at all.For a restaurant that has been around as long as this one and for the amount of patrons that have been here, I really would have thought there would have been more to it. If you want a real \"Modern\" Singaporean meal, I would highly suggest you visit Labyrinth instead.",

    "text": "This is a review of a Thursday evening dinner date at Wild Rocket.The restaurant is located in the Hangout at Mount Emily. \u00a0Even though it is not, it has the feel of being in a secluded area.i quite liked the ambiance of the restaurant. \u00a0It had the feel of casual fine dining. \u00a0I thought it was a very comfortable room. \u00a0The wall with many candles added a warmth to the room. \u00a0 My dinner companion \u00a0was less taken with \u00a0the space.tinyurl.com/bs5os3xThe service was very good. \u00a0Our server was attentive, professional, and polite. \u00a0He was also quite knowledgeable about the menu and proactively provided input without being intrusive. The \u00a0food ranged from good with some technical errors to extremely good. \u00a0Each dish was presented with a clean and classic style. \u00a0While simple, the presentation was elegant.Complimentary Bread - The meal began with a nice warm focaccia bread served with olive oil and salt. \u00a0When we had finished the first plate, they were quick to ask and bring another \u00a0plate.tinyurl.com/ca529xtSoft shell chili crab with squid ink mantou - This was a tasty appetizer sized interpretation of the classic chili crab.tinyurl.com/cogpfrcBeef Carpaccio with sesame ginger puree - For me, this was a home-run. \u00a0The dish came with the ginger puree in the middle. \u00a0Our server explained that \u00a0the puree should be spread out across the carpaccio. \u00a0This was slightly easier said than done. \u00a0But, once I had achieved getting it spread around, it was so good. \u00a0The spread added such a refreshing element to the simple application of beef carpaccio.tinyurl.com/d5b5t9rLaksa Pesto Linguini - My friend ordered the laksa pasta. \u00a0The flavour was quite nice. \u00a0It was a very assertive flavour but I liked it and she seemed to also. \u00a0The server had also provided input that the dish was strongly flavoured. \u00a0However, the dish (specifically the pasta) was very dry and this definitely detracted from this entree.tinyurl.com/ck2nk4zRoasted Chilean Seabass with chai poh confit & congee - The fish was perfectly prepared. \u00a0It was delicate and flaky. \u00a0However, I would have preferred that it was served with something \u00a0that would provide a balance to the overall flavours. \u00a0The congee did not seem to compliment the seabass. \u00a0It competed and came close to overpowering the simple natural flavour of the fish.tinyurl.com/cnbtceuCrab Meat Whipped Potatoes - She ordered a side of crab-meat mashed potatoes. \u00a0For each of us, this was a new preparation. \u00a0In the end, I found it to be good but it didn't really standout from other whipped potatoes and the crab may have actually interfered with creating the best possible texture for the potatoes.tinyurl.com/c9geazkDark Lava Chocolate Gateau with flamb\u00e9 banana - For dessert, she ordered the chocolate lava cake. \u00a0This was pretty much a standard implementation of this dish that has recently become a staple. It was good but there wasn't anything to set it apart from other versions of the \u00a0same dish. \u00a0On the other-hand, you really can't go wrong with a cake filled with delicious melted chocolate.tinyurl.com/bn5nzjxWild Rocket Strawberry Cheesecake - \u00a0Maybe it is becoming a clich\u00e9 to serve food in a martini glass. \u00a0But this was still a visually interesting and appealing dessert. \u00a0Following the server's instructions, I cut my spoon down and into the dessert insuring to get a little bit of everything. \u00a0I have to say, it was divine. \u00a0It was a great dessert incorporating multiple levels of sharp flavours, sweet flavours, and varying textures.tinyurl.com/cwexnmsReceipt ($292.40):tinyurl.com/bt9bz9cOverall - I thought Wild Rocket combined excellent service, a comfortable and slightly elegant space with relatively good food that included some true high-points. \u00a0From a culinary perspective, the execution was not perfect but did not greatly affect the \u00a0overall enjoyment of the meal. \u00a0I would definitely consider returning to Wild Rocket.",

    "text": "I headed down to this place quite a while ago and am very sure the menu has been revamped since then but I'm quite sure the tastes and quality will still be relevant now.I've heard a lot about the place prior to going to Wild Rocket, especially so from my friend who convinced me to make the trip down because she was so impressed by the food from an earlier visit. Situated within Mount Emily, it was a comfortable setting to have a nice weekend lunch amidst the greenery surrounding the small boutique hotel it is located at.Being a fan of brown rice, I naturally veered towards the Salmon Carpaccio Brown Rice for my starter. For those who love asiatic flavours, you'll fall in love with this dish - the melt-in-your-mouth salmon coupled with the nutty aromatic brown rice and sesame seeds, mixed with chewy bits of octopus meat. This was an amazing mix of textures and flavours which makes you well and truly appreciate the beauty of well-prepared food.I also had the Chilean Seabass with Chai Poh confit. I loved the flakiness of the plush fish meat which was done plain to accompany to richer topping. The chai poh was not overpowering salty like how typical ones can be, showing how properly done food doesn't need too much seasoning to work. All these was served on a bed of plain congee which was a throwback to childhood food and really comforting to have.I rounded off my meal with something richer, the Strawberry Cheesecake. More like a deconstructed version of the cake, you get a creamy strawberry cheese icecream with a thick body layered with chunky bits of graham base.",

The food I'm about 50/50. My girlfriend was worried she would have order envy but it turned out the other way around. Her red rice salmon and baby octopus starter was delicate, rich and delicious. My shitake consomme was deep, dark and earthy but the wonton itself was a let down. The wrapper was chewy and the filling bland. Her pasta was perfectly al dente in a deliciously dark sticky sauce. My chilli spanner crab linguini was so drenched in a quite sweet and not very chilli sauce that I didn't notice the pasta. Service was friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "You know, I visited Wild Rocket back when it was relatively fresh and a super 'hot table'. I wasn't impressed, and never went back.So when a friend said that dinner was at Wild Rocket, I was unenthused, and actually a little wary. Wild Rocket team, I apologise. You've gotten better. First off, the service was outstanding. I asked the waiter attending to our table if the once signature laksa pesto pasta was still available despite being not on the menu, and he was very candid in telling us that it's a love it or hate it dish. When we ended up passing, he brought out a \u00a0moderate sized portion anyway \"just for us to try\" (and of course didn't charge us for it). He was able to give recommendations easily, and most importantly, honestly! He told us to avoid certain dishes, and everything that he recommended was spot on.Well. We ignored him when it came to dessert and were glad we did, but more on that later.I confess to forgetting exactly what we had for starters and mains, but I do remember all of us being quite impressed, particularly with the mains. I believe my friend had the pork, and it was particularly memorable. The one let down that evening was the pasta main (not the pesto) that our other dining companion ordered. It was a bit flat, and really quite unspectacular. Desserts though, were an absolute treat. We had... hmm. A chendol I think? Of some sort, with delicious gula melaka, a ice jelly type thing, and a deconstructed apple pie I believe. Our waiter had actually recommended the molten chocolate cake over the ice jelly, but we were glad we ignored him. The other desserts were rich enough, and the ice jelly with lime granita... or was it a lemon sorbet, well with sour frozen thing proved to be an excellent contrast. We mainly ignored it though because really, once you've had a good molten chocolate cake, you've probably seen them all.So yes, I'm glad I went back to re-experience Wild Rocket. The food was creative, really quite delicious, and the service warm and accommodating. That's a winning combination.",

    "text": "One of my fave restaurants in Singapore; partly because it's located on Mt Sophia (fond memories of high school at MGS) but mostly because it's so quiet and serene up in the exclusive and secluded neighborhood. Love the laksa pasta, their take on black pepper soft shell crab and everything they have on the brunch menu. If you're looking for a leisurely, quiet, no-fuss, no drama meal, Wild Rocket is the way to go",

Never a dull experience. The location is a bit hard to get to but worth the taxi ride or drive to Upper Willie Road.",
