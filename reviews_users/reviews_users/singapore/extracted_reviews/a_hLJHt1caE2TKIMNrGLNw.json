    "text": "Been having the Korean food cravings lately so I decided to drop by here on a Saturday after seeing the storefront a few days before. The interior design is welcoming and the wall decorations are inviting. My mother and I were quickly seated and were each given a menu to look over. Since I was craving for Ddukbokki (rice cake), I ordered that as well as Yuzu as beverage.The waitress placed 4 side dishes on our table - sugar coated ikan bilis, kimchi, spicy octopus/jellyfish (unsure) and black beans. The black beans were good. It has a little sweet taste to it - honey was probably added.My dish came around 10 minutes after the order was taken. The first plunge using my metal spoon was the rice cake with the spicy sauce on top. The rice cake was stringy and chewy. I have been craving this texture for awhile ever since I got back from Los Angeles. Been missing the rice cake at Koreatown Galleria's food court. Besides that, the sauce was spicy, sweet and tangy at the same time. On the plate of Ddukbokki, there were glass noodle (was surprised to see it inside as it is normally used to do jap chae) and korean cabbage with fish cakes. All I can say is that I will definitely be back for more. This is the closest taste to the one I had in L.A. Price wise, it is considered pricy but worth for the ingredients as well as the right spicy sauce taste. Will be back for other dishes as well as this dish I love :)Tried the dolsot bimbimbap (vegetarian). The ingredients are fresh and the portion was right. As it is served on a hot plate, the bottom of the rice is crispy. You would need to mix the ingredients, rice and chilli sauce before the steamy effect goes out. Probably will be much better with beef slices :)",

Iced water was not served.Saba & Samguebsal (S$15.80++)Grilled pork belly, chicken sausage, and mackerel with sauce. Served with rice and soup.The pork belly was tough here although it was thinly sliced. The mackerel was a tab dry.Japchae (S$7.80++)Stir-fried glass noodles and vegetables in soy sauce seasoning.The fried noodles looked a tab plain although it was flavourful.Banchan :Gamja Jorim (Soy Braised Potatoes )Myulchi Bokkeum (Stir-fried Anchovies)Kongnamul-muchim (Marinated Bean Sprouts)Kimchi Not much choice when your dining partner refused to have anything spicy. Not sure why, but the kimchi tasted a tab off here with a kind of sour taste.",

    "text": "It offers 4 free flow sides/appetizers. It was so-so but I think it's kimchi is not bad and is rather crunchy. Tried it's Kimchi soup with rice and was quite impressed by the flavour; is so savory leaves you wanting more. Even as I was sweating eating it, I had a hard time finishing it because of its portions. It's so appetizing I just kept going! Free flow water at no cost does help in this aspect. Another dish we tried was the Ginseng soup. The soup may be a bit bland but because it's portions were so huge and there are actually rice underneath the soup (a bit like porridge or is it already porridge?), couldn't imagine anyone finishing it with a heavier flavour. However you can definitely taste and eat the Ginseng added to it and is a nice healthier choice. Choices in the menu is a little bit limited to me. After all it's just a small joint in the Plaza Sing shopping mall. Prices are before GST and service charges added to it. Service is not very responsive. I requested something twice and it wasn't given until I asked for the third time! When they served the dishes, they forgotten about the utensils! Sometimes I do hope Singapore eateries lump the prices together with the service charge so that I will not grumble paying for it.",

    "text": "Can you believe it? This is the only decent Korean restaurant in Plaza Singapura!! And by what I've had, this is somewhere where I would go to if I were desperately craving Korean food and needed a quick fix.We went to Manna Story with the thought of having Budae Jiggae. We were seated at the two-persons table near the entrance. As we were carrying lots of bags and it was rather cramp, we were asked to move to a two-person couch seat. I noticed that the couple at the table next to me ordered something similar and the plug that was used to power the hot pot was used. We placed our order and the waitress asked us if it would be okay if our food was kitchen-cooked as there was no more plug to power our hot pot. The whole point of eating Budae Jiggae was to self-cook, that's the fun of it! We said we would rather self-cook our meal and the waitress looked distressed as she didn't know what else to do. I asked if we could sit at the 4-person table and she said no, that's for a bigger group. Her colleague came over and offered us another couch seat for 4 persons. The up side is that the tables could be split if need to. We took that seat but the spacing between the tables was so small that it was impossible to go through the gap without hitting on something. The couple next to us who left, had to pull out the entire table before the other person sitting on the couch could get out. And all this time, the staff didn't offer to help. Hmmm. Also, our table was not wiped clean and there were some remnants of spilled soup and a strand of hair on the table. I called the waitress over and asked if she could wipe down our table again as it wasn't cleaned. She used her hand to swipe the hair off our table and took a while to come back with a cloth to wipe the table looking very nonchalant. Somehow, we were not very impressed by the staff here and their attitude could do with a bit more sprucing up.The Budae Jiggae was so-so. The luncheon meat and sausage wasn't much although it was for 2 persons so we order additional beef. The beef came pre-cooked before it was added to our hot pot and was downright delicious!Would I return here again for a meal? Maybe not. I truly hope that there would be more options for Korean food (besides the food court) in Plaza Singapura soon!Believe it or not, the queue outside Manna Story was unbelievably long! Not the the food is out of this world but I guess, most people just wanted to have a Korean food fix. Food for thought; maybe I should open a Korean Restaurant at PS ;P",

    "text": "When it comes to Korean food, I'm quite picky and I seldom venture away from Togi, my favorite Korean restaurant at Mosque Street. To me, all Korean restaurants are dubious otherwise tried and tasted by myself. When a gf suggested having this for dinner, I was doubtful. The fact that it's a little open diner at PS basement didn't help much. But I was surprised by the food, the stews to be specific.I was in a meat and rice mood so I didn't order my usual Soondybujigae so I can't compare it with Togi. The Dolsot Bimbimbap was quite average. It was kinda lacking in the crunch and juiciness of the vegetables. The meat wasn't very well flavored. Overall it was kinda bland.Gf had a beef stew which was amazing! The base is slightly spicy but hits all the savory notes one could ask for in a stew. I could possibly finish a pot of rice with this soup dish. Will definitely head back to try the Soondybujigae! Prices are quite reasonable but the variety of dishes is quite limited. Free flow of 4 side dishes but they are quite meh.",

No way.And the beef bugolgi, it was more like beef strips taken out of sukiyaki and put on a hot plate. \u00a0And the rice? \u00a0Koreans are very particular about their rice. \u00a0Putting normal jasmine rice into a metal bowl doesn't magically make it Korean.Go to this place if you need an affordable lunch without having to wait too long, but please, don't come here if you're looking for Korean.",

    "text": "Manna Story is a Korean restaurant at the basement of Plaza Singapura. An additional plus point is that I rarely see it crowded. \u00a0 I really like the food there - it's decent Korean comfort food at an affordable price. I love the Dolsot Bi Bim Bab with beef for $12.80 (a little more if you add extra cheese, etc.). Another two dishes I'd recommend is the Ginseng Chicken Soup for $15.80 (if you're feeling healthy) and the Kimchi stew with pork for $12 (it's extremely spicy though!). \u00a0The portions are generous and always leave me feeling well-fed. They also do take-away. Staff are sometimes slightly inflexible and unaccommodating - tried asking a waitress to add an additional egg in the kimchi stew today and she refused saying it was impossible as it was a \"set menu\".",
