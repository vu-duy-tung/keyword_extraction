Creatively presented dishes did not compromise on quality and despite being a large group, each dish was exquisite. I will certainly come back to this place during regular hours and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their dining experience!",

The quirky area, the decor, the ambiance whisks me away as if I was on holiday in Latin America. \u00a0I really love it here. \u00a0The food is delicious and presented beautifully, and it reminds me of restaurants back home in Los Angeles.Some of my favourite dishes:*Avocado Wasbi Tuna Tartare- amazing. Fresh, delicious, balanced, and quite authentic. Craving fresh tartare, ceviche, etc. frequently, I really do get my fix here. Highly recommended*Slow Cooked beef Short Ribs- tender, juicy, flavorful. Just wish there was more on the plate!*Seared Scallops in Mushroom Sauce- scallops cooked perfectly and the earthiness of heartiness of the mushrooms really pack a punch*Rocket & Iberico Pizza- AWESOME!. Love this.*Pork Belly with Purple Mash- Another delicious and tender creation. I could eat this all day! The crackling is a bit too hard for me, but it sure packs a crunch.Order a bottle of wine, and you are set for a great date place. Beware of the reservations though- they are always full, but if you book in advance, you will not be disappointed!",

We had the duck salad, pork belly, and snapper main to share, washed down with some house red. This is a small-plates sort of place, where you share things. The ingredient combinations here are refreshing and interesting, and I quite liked everything in general.The ambience is however, a bit iffy because it can get quite stuffy/humid. Come here on a cool day/night. I cannot imagine having lunch here if I was perspiring slightly at dinner. The place gets packed at dinner, even on a Monday, so make a booking prior.",

Happily, it was a company event and so I didn't pay and we got to try a variety of things :)Appetizers/(\"To share\"):1. Rocket parma pizza ($26) - nice thin crust, I'm not a huge fan of parma so no comments on that. 2. BBQ riblets ($20) - quite a substantial amt of ribs! and parmesan rosemary potatoes which were a bit undercooked, I think. at least, there was quite some bite to them that I don't really expect from potatoes.3. Seared scallops w sweet mushroom reduction ($23) - four delicious scallops! The sauce was really pretty sweet, surprisingly. I have a sweet tooth so this was by far my favourite! I wonder if there was any wine in the reduction. Anyway, nice juicy mushrooms and a cherry tomato, mm.4. Crispy salt and pepper squid ($15) - normal. I guess fried stuff just appealed to my colleagues :p Also it came recommended by the server.Mains:1. Balsamic Duck Leg w Butter Parsnip Mash and Sesame Asparagus ($30) - my dish! Mmm. Very tender and sweet balsamic reduction. I couldn't tell parsnip from potato though, shrugs. Some bits of parsnip in the mash, pretty nice change in texture. 2. Day night pork belly ($29) - came recommended by server. I didn't taste this but colleagues said it was good!3. Tenderloin w herb butter and cabernet reduction, roasted pumpkin + goat cheese quinoa, vege skewer ($39) - by far the most expensive item on the menu. Really tender beef! And the reduction was delicious. Quinoa was so-so, nothing special. 4. Squid ink rice w prawns, squid, egg ($25) - I thought this was quite value-for-$, was surprised there were quite a few ingredients to this dish! Colleague loved it. She did have to contend with black lips/teeth after though :p Oh, and the rice was slightly spicy, very intriguing.Saw a few others having the lambrack, looked like quite a lot of stuff on the plate! I guess it does also cost $36.. Anyway, we sadly had no time for dessert, although I would've loved to try their ice cream. Maybe next time! Ambiance was nice, surprisingly it wasn't too hot although open-air, guess there were a LOT of fans blowing. Can kind of see Kallang River, pretty cool. Also, on the second floor of this one building kind of in the middle of nowhere, not much signage. Cool decor!",

    "text": "Japanese Fusion restaurants are not a thing unheard of lately, with every launch boasting a uniqueness that is slowly becoming commonplace. Quietly located in a 2 story retired factory building, Kilo takes us back to the charm & allure of our very first fusion dining experience. Its open-air laid-back atmosphere and casually dressed staff offer a sense of warmth and comfort while its minimalistic art & interiors echo a hint of character and sophistication. The menu channels the identity of its predecessor, Raw Kitchen Bar, where owners Sharon & Javier hooked us onto their creativity. With a plethora of Japanese - Italian dishes, each tickling the taste buds more than the next, the real draw was the Figs topped with Danish blue cheese, roasted walnuts & bacon. The sweetness of the Figs paired with the saltiness of the bacon and creamy texture of the blue cheese was spectacular. The 12-Hour Roasted Pork Belly was no less; tongue-caressingly soft and perfectly complimented with the purple mash, its rich flavors were hard to beat. The Tune Tartare & Ceviche platter added the familiarity of our favorite fusion dishes to this quaint oasis; Kilo has proven to be the highly impressive sister of Raw - personable, un-gimmicky and vivacious from the very first bite.",

    "text": "Located next to the breezy Kallang River, Kilo is quite a charming spot, being one a second level of a warehouse-like building, completely raw and void of lavish decorations except for some rugs and an eclectic mix of tables and chairs.We got ourselves seated at the bar and started off the meal with Mango Tuna Poke and Wonton Chips, only cause the voyeuristic me send many virtual thumbs up for this dish. We dug in for our first bite, a pregnant pause and then, one of my dinner mates announced, \"I don't eat raw tuna... but this is GOOD.\" This was made of raw tuna, fresh mangoes and cucumber in a mix of savoury, sweet and crunchy.We also ordered a serving of Grilled Portobello Mushroom served with Potato Strips. Thick, juice and succulent baked with the savoury sin of oozing cheese and topped with tangy salsa.Chilli Prawn Pizza \u00a0arrived and we eyed the chilli padis on it cautiously. We each too a slice and bit into the slice of indulgence. A marker of a good pizza is a good balance of the bite of the pizza base, the softness of the cheese, the sauce and ingredients. This was so amazing, we ordered this twice. The juicy prawns was heightened by the flavourful paste and paired lovely with the pizza base with the basil leaves breaking the bites with a little spice. Very asian, very awesome. This is fusion well-done.With fusion cuisine having the tendency of trying too hard, I think many are often disappointed with what is offered. I was happy to find Kilo, working with Asian flavours the best they are presented and modernizing them with Western ways to serving. You'll love this one.",

    "text": "I'd probably say this is one of the better 'European' dining I've had in Singapore.. the menu largely consists of small plates (good for sharing between four) and about 6-8 main dishes to share from. We mainly stuck to the shared plates and budgeted about 1.5 plates per person. The great dishes? The chilli and prawn pizza - great base and \u00a0good hit of spiceThe tuna tartar (although no taste of wasabi that was promised on the menu...)The portabello mushrooms - fresh and tastyThe squid ink rice with squid and prawns - liked the egg yolk on top, nice touchThe salt and pepper squid - not as peppery as i'd like but plenty of squidSo-so?Ceviche (I've had some pretty good ceviche in my time and felt this was lacking in flavour and spice)The gyoza (kinda felt like it was a fried pancake with gyoza hidden at the bottom... didn't do it for me)Quinoa salad... just meh. Very limited beer menu (2 choices) and desserts, boo. The lava cake with icream is tasty and good value, but don't do the apple and carrot icecream as one of our fellow diners did... feels like you're detoxing at dessert. Felt like the restaurant has good ambience and although it feels like it's in the middle of nowhere, it's actually very close to bugis. The view is nicer as it gets dark so you only have the view of lights on water rather than a drain and a dirty river! Alfresco style on the 2nd floor but doesn't get hot with the river breeze and fans keeping the humidit at bay. Service is really efficient and helpful without being overbearing. They were able to split the bill three ways which I appreciate. We spent $55 per person and were well stuffed by the end of it. The most similar restaurant I've been to is Artichoke for its tapas-share style menu and I felt this restaurant was MUCH better than artichoke (despite the more limited wine and dessert menu!). I would definitely go back with friends. Recommend.",

    "text": "This is my favoritest restaurant in Singapore. By a light year. Seriously, I lurve it.I heard about Kilo from my boss at work. It almost made me not want to go: he said it was in a rundown building in the middle of nowhere, no air-con, and to boot, I'm not sure that I really trust his palate. Boy am I glad that I tried it.So, yes, it's not in a conventional boring mall as everything is in Singapore but I think it adds to the charm. The building it's in is set back on from the road and walking distance from the Lavender stop. There's no air-con but ample fans going to keep you cool. It's a swank restaurant, I think. It's got an easy, non-pretentious vibe to it, abstract art hanging up on the wall, cacti decor - it's one of those places you just feel hipper or more interesting sitting in.Now to the menu. There's tons of seafood options on it. When I go, I usually make it as far as the appetizers. It's all shareable. And I love tapas-style dining. I'm not sure that I would call it Japanese Italian or whatever - it's just effing good food. There's a ceviche platter that's to DIE for. It's got tuna, salmon, and octopus ceviches and the taste so rightly fresh and citrusy. Last time I went with friends, we chowed down and ordered seconds. There's also the ribs that fall off of the bone. Tell your grandma that she can leave her dentures at home for this one. And then the scallops that come in a mushroomy-marsala sauce you should definitely order. The sauce on it is so buttery and delicious. You'll be asking for bread to sop it up. Or licking the plate if you're on some weird ass Atkin's BS.Wine list is extensive and priced well. With this list, it makes you wonder why other restaurants in Singapore rape you on their price points. Either that or the owners Sharon and Javier just want to introduce you to some great vino. Either way, you win here.And service is attentive. My water glass was always filled with my lemon infused tap water. Such a nice touch. The only drawback here is that Sharon and Javier, even though they don't advertise and rely on word-of-mouth press from their happy customers, get booked out. So RSVP early! It's worth it. And even then, Sharon (who answers all of the emails or the phone) hates to turn away customers. She told me last time, \"Ohhhh Jason! I'm sorry it took so long to get you in! You know, if you randomly show up, we can try and fit you at the bar.\" God, such hospitality.",

Then called Raw Kitchen Bar, he served food with Japanese, Thai and Italian influences, and he's carried over those flavours to Kilo, to the joy of many of his regulars.The feel is everything: stepping out of the lift (which was already cool -the wooden accents and detailed vent... who does that?), I was greeted with what looked like a grungy New York city loft apartment, except there were a couple dozen chairs around large granite tiles masquerading as tables. So you get the feel that it's a pretty cool spot, doncha?On to the food then... we had a pretty big crew that night, and we might have had most of the menu. Starters included a damn tasty row of scallops topped with a cream sauce, chock full of rough-cut mushrooms, and the signature three-fish ceviche. Did I say damn tasty? Mains were well-executed classics like a braised lamb shank on mega creamy mash. Have to give special mention to the 12-hour pork - GORGEOUS. Meat that almost flakes apart, And that skin. Oh, that crackly, fragrant goodness. It was ridiculous. All that disappeared in a flash. So much for sharing, guys. We'll just have to go back again, I guess.p.s. KILO isn't a reference to weight, but for the nautical signal, which means \"I want to communicate with you\". I had to ask. I'm geeky that way.",

Alas, my companion and I had a reservation. Out of the 4 starters we shared, one was exceptional (figs with Danish blue), the other was acceptable (zucchini pancake) and the other two were disappointing. The salmon mint sashimi was overpowered by mint and lime, to the extent that you can't taste the salmon anymore. Not a good thing to do with such a tasty fish. Also, portion was really small. Think amuse bouche-sized. But the biggest let down has got to be the beef tartare with quail egg and fries. basically just over seared beef of unexceptional quality, hardly any flavor with a hard-boiled quail egg and thin fries. Incidentally, it was the most expensive item amongst the starters and came highly recommended by fellow yelpers. Maybe we got there on an off day, but this tartare did not come close to others I've tried. Well, we had no mood for mains or dessert after. The bill came up to nearly $100 for just 4 starters. The only dish I can recommend from my kilo experience is the figs with blue cheese.",

Innovative fusion dishes are made with fresh, quality ingredients and cooked with great culinary prowess, ensuring a great experience there.Located on the 2nd level of TURE, the open air restaurant is small and cosy, complete with a bar in the corner. Be sure to make reservations in advance as there is limited seating. Also, do take note that the food takes quite a long time to be served!Their delectable starters are designed to whet the appetite and visually stimulate the consumer. My absolute favorites are the seared scallops with mushroom sauce, the fresh fig with danish blue cheese and avocado tuna wasabi tartare. The pizzas here are of the thin crust variety and not very big, so they are also ideal for sharing as a starter.Going on to the mains, I must say I've tried quite a few of them, so let me give you the lowdown. The balsamic duck leg is basically duck confit with a twist. The balsamic gives it a beautiful flavor. It's very tender and juicy as it's braised. There is also butter mash and asparagus served with it.The 12 hour pork belly never fails to impress. The crackling is crispy and dry, and the dish is served with a yummy purple mash that strangely makes me feel less guilty. The angel hair cream of Ebiko is an interesting fusion, with the ebiko providing a great texture to the pasta. Lastly, the tenderloin served with herb butter and a cabaret reduction sauce is always perfectly cooked to a beautiful medium rareness. Still it was probably the least interesting dish, compared to the other items note menu.There is a pretty good selection of wine and drinks to go with your meal. Definitely highly recommended! :)",

    "text": "Overdone on hipster and under cooked in quality. Definitely not \"the best restaurant in Singapore\" or close. \u00a0Overrated and disappointing dishes. We had four \"to shares\" at ~$20++ a pop. \u00a0We picked them from the waiter's recommendation: Spicy salmon sashimi, beef with quail egg, zucchini pancake and stuffed figs. Salmon sashimi: could not taste the salmon as was overpowered with lime juice and seasoning. They added what appeared to be rice sushi topping on top. Small amount of salmon.Beef with quail egg: \u00a0the beef was bland and there was no sauce to add a kick. Quail egg overcooked. Dry bread on the side. \u00a0Worst dish of the four.Zucchini pancake: two pancakes with mound of rocket and cream-cheese. Tasty, but nothing exciting.Stuffed figs with bacon: good! six small figs, stuffed with creamy cheese, rocket and bacon. We were still hungry after the four dishes four two people, but given the quality so far, decided to stop there.Ambiance: hipsterish, with a fixed gear bicycle planted in a corner. It gets loud with a full house as the room is relatively small and the floors and roof are concrete, hence bad acoustics. Early on in the night, the owner/manager/hip dude was playing music from a DJ set; \u00a0music was lousy and too loud. I felt bad for a couple next to the speakers.",

    "text": "I used to be a regular of Raw Kitchen Bar on Upper Bukit Timah, and followed their move to Kampong Bugis under the new moniker of Kilo. It's definitely changed, particularly in terms of the general vibe and style, but the food at Kilo is still excellent Japanese fusion fare and the flavours have continued to be exciting and fresh. My only gripe is that, in comparison to Raw which had a large setting that included a lush outdoor area, the new space at Kilo is much smaller and feels comparatively cramped. It certainly is more intimate and exclusive now, but I do miss those days at Raw and the amazing set-up they had. Nevertheless, this still remains one of my favourites in Singapore at the moment for excellent casual dining.",

    "text": "Last night I played host to the first Girl's Night our group has had in a long time. I have met a number of new women in the past couple of months and wanted to introduce them to all my friends. Also, a number of women are leaving in the next few months and I want to make sure we spend some quality time together before then. But beyond all these practical reasons, the universe was telling me to try this new restaurant: Kilo.So as women are want to do we gabbed for 3 hours, moving around the table to chat with new people, sharing bites of food, complimenting each other's jewelry. To be quite frank I was most surprised the whole evening that 1. I have 10 girl friends in Singapore and 2. All the women I invited came!Sure enough, everyone loved it. The dining room was open and furnished sparsely with sleek teak chairs and glass topped tables. If you had put the New York skyline behind the expansive windows we would have believed we were in Dumbo because it was so much like a loft. The first wine recommendation was a Pinot Noir, earning Kilo them some points. I must say everything looked tasty on the menu so I'm going to make a few trips to explore it. Last night I went for the scallops to start and then the duck leg. The scallops were very tender, almost underdone, but the sauce atop them was amazing. My duck leg was expertly cooked (unlike some of the tenderloin going around the table) but I felt the balsamic reduction masked some of the flavor and made the skin soggy. It also came with mashed potatoes [super tasty] and asparagus [love].After we closed the bill and emptied the fifth bottle of Pinot, the majority of women left and four diehards had dessert. My Penguin's Lemon Tart was so delicious and made me want to remake the lemon squares I had dishes up recently. Who knew fresh basil on whip cream was so good.Definitely need to repeat Girls' Night and Kilo soon.",

Great food, excellent service and a cool layout. Nothing singularly stands out, and everything we had was flavoursome and enjoyable. The lounge upstairs is homely and has some nice comfy couches. Certainly going back!",

    "text": "Kilo is certainly off the beaten path, but a path I am glad we found. Some friends suggested Kilo after reading about it in some guidebooks and magazines. \u00a0They made reservations for an early dinner on Saturday night. My husband and I pulled up in our uber. The uber driver said, \"Are you sure this is the place?\" Honestly, we were not sure. Fortunately, it was the place. Kilo is on the 2nd floor and the Kilo Lounge is on the 8th floor. We arrived early so we went up to the lounge for a drink. They told us to come back in 15 minutes (which was fine). We went downstairs and my husband had a beer at the coffee shop, Loysel's Toy, on the first floor. After a few minutes, we went back up to the Lounge. The staff was very welcoming. My husband had a beer and I had a glass of rose. We laughed at the decor. My husband said it looked like some college fraternity guys said, \"Let's open a bar/restaurant and just use the furniture we already have!\" But, never judge a book by it's cover, right? After finishing drinks we went downstairs to Kilo. We met our friends and were promptly seated at our table. We ordered some cocktails. I had sangria for my first round which was very good, but I went with wine for my second round. Kilo gives a nice big pour unlike many places in Singapore. We were told by the waiter that dishes were made to share. We ordered the tuna and wasabi, a sushi roll, seared scallops, a grilled romaine salad, a fig and walnut salad, the pork belly and the ribs. Honestly, every bit of it was absolutely delicious and presented beautifully. The pork belly and the ribs were the true standout. I would go back and order two orders of each. The only reason why Kilo did not earn 5 stars is that the portion sizes are really small. I can't say that I left really full, but it was very tasty and we will be back!",

    "text": "Here's a place I can get great flavours and textures even if they appear 'common' at first fight. The grilled scallops with a good rich mushroom ragout ( if I get this right) had the sweet, savoury balance and the right textures of perfectly cooked scallops. Luckily, there's more than just one for each even if you shared it out!Here at Kilo, you will see plenty of 'skins' used as crisp for garnishing and they are sinful delights that I excuse myself for relishing. It's afterall once in a blue moon, or maybe not. Once, I dined at kilo twice in a week with the lovely sous vide pork belly and the feta pumpkin rocket salad. One of the items that stuck with me is the purple yukon mash. Silky, creamy and purple, great visual effects and gastronomical bliss all at once.For more of such Japanese Italian fusion cuisine, you will have to try it for yourself. They also have a good selection of wines and beverages to keep to relaxed all night!",
