    "text": "This place has to be one of the hidden secrets of Singapore. It's tucked inside an HDB housing estate; even some of my Singaporean friends who live in the area didn't know about it until I told them. The crab bee hoon was simply fantastic. The crab was extremely fresh and meaty, and the soup very very savory. In addition to the crab bee hoon, the stirfry dishes are really good too; with crispy vegetables and tender meats just like how they are supposed to be. The one hour wait was well worth it. The price was reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food; definitely better in every way compared with the boat quay tourist traps. This is a place for people who truly know how to appreciate good food and experience life in another culture. It is not for those who look for Hard rock cafes everywhere they go. If you are going there from the CBD, try taking the 851 bus. It's not as speedy as the MRT but you'll get to see a lot more. Life is about experiencing different cultures, the food, the people, and the daily lives. Give this place a try and skip the chains!",

The other dish that I would order is crab bathed in creamy less buttery soup with some udon like noodles.The only two things I don't like is that one rude person who took my order and sounded like I owed him a great amount of money and the waiting time. But who am I kidding here? Everywhere with good food needs to wait. So the next time I go, I hope that that guy won't be there to take my order.Current medium (which is the large) crab over at Mellbenn is about $80 per crab. Tell me where else would have tasty butter crab and I will hunt it down.",

You would have to take the Red North South Line to Ang Mo Kio, and either have a long walk or hail a taxicab. But, the location is prime because of the large space.Be prepared to wait though. There are usually long lines here, and a group of 10 of us had to queue for about 45-55 minutes. Pick up a menu, and prepare to order while waiting in line so the wait for your food will not take as long once you are seated.We ordered 2 small chili crabs, 2 small butter crabs, 1 medium Signature Crab Soup Bee Hoon (Noodle Soup), Jia Mantao (Fried Buns - which are great for dipping in the chili or butter sauce), and stirred fried vegetables. This was the perfect amount for 10 of us!Having tried a lot of seafood from all over the world from Maine Lobster to Scandinavian Salmon to Hawker Centres across Singapore, this has definitely been one of the freshest and most tasty seafood experiences I have had. We ended up pay about $33 Singaporean dollars per person, which is not bad at all!The wait is long, but it is worth it!",

Where they used to be one stall in a kopitiam, they are now the entire kopitiam (which got revamped to look more restaurant-like, adorned with decorated crab shells on the walls.. quite cute). The prices are significantly more expensive now.The crab bee hoon soup is still excellent, rich and delicious as always. The creamy butter crab still has the tasty sauce that few other stalls can replicate. I also like the Playboy Chicken (feng liu ji) which is what people here would usually call Thai-style lemon chicken, except it's better and comes with a beautiful sauce. I still like it, but it's become harder to justify coming back here as often as I used to, just because of how expensive it has become.",

    "text": "Utterly absolutely amazing. I'm hard pressed to think of a better place to get a crab fix. This place was so highly adorned by my fellow crab-worshipping friends, yet I was an unbeliever for the longest time - for this I repent!!!We shared a huge butter crab, chilli crab and a bowl of crab bee hoon (with a whole crab in it of course). Everything was absolutely stunning. The least overwhelming one was probably the chilli crab, mostly because this is a taste you could get from your Jumbos and Long Beaches and the chilli sauce isn't particularly special. The butter crab, on the other hand, was soooo to die for. It was tastefully sweet, and perfectly buttery. Think about the best butter prawns you've had in your life, and think of that taste in a bottle. Now open that bottle and pour that insane goodness all over this beautifully fat steamed crab, throw on some curry leaves and you've got a plate of perfection before you. I confess to underestimating the power of the crab bee hoon. When my friends proposed to order that, I was going all \"huh, noodles at a crab place - really?\" But how incredibly wrong I was. The broth was sooo sedap and rich with the fragrance of the crab cooked in it. It is also very milky and makes a perfect accompaniment to the noodles, or just as a soup on its own. It's so good that it makes the crab in it a little underwhelming. It was ultimately still really good steamed crab, but I spent most of my time slurping the soup with noodles and digging into the butter crab instead.One warning though: be ready to queue for so so long. Bring a stool, bring a fan, bring a book, bring a friend. We went really early at 530pm and were fortunate to only have to wait in line for about 40 minutes, but a friend of mine once spent 3 hours in line on a weekday night, so...brace yourself!",

I haven't been able to find a restaurant anywhere in the US that emulates this restaurant.My only gripe with this place is the customer service. It's not the best, and that really isn't acceptable. Our chrysanthemum tea had dead flies in it. It was like the box was infested with dead fruit flies and they just brewed the tea anyhow. My cousin and my aunties raised hell, and it was quite possibly the funniest moment I've ever seen.This being said, they first tried to deny it, and then they brought us fresh tea. Regardless of this, they didn't do anything else to make up for their folly. No discount, no service of extra food, not even a genuine and heartfelt apology.The food is fantastic, but is it really worth putting up with lackluster customer service? You'll have to decide.",

    "text": "After being on my list of places to check out for ages, a few of us went down to Mellben AMK to try their famous crab bee hoon on Mothers Day 2012. Firstly, the queue is always large, others here seem to think you can get through quickly at certain hours, but not anywhere near dinner. We arrived at 7:15pm, were seated at 8:30pm and the food arrived after 9pm.But when it does arrive, it is well worth the wait. The menu does not have prices listed, which is terrible, so prices may be slightly off. The first to arrive was the tofu combination ($7.80) which was a dozen or so fried tofu squares, some broccoli, two shelled prawns and two scallops. Quite average.Next up was the famous fried crab bee hoon ($55). We were lucky to get a female crab with lots of roe, and the whole dish is out of this world awesome. Not an incredibly secret list of ingredients, it should be easy to replicate this at home.Finally, the last dish was butter crab ($55) which I would never have ordered normally, except I read the comments on HGW and honestly believe in the wisdom of crowds. Very awesome dish, the sauce was thick, buttery, had a hint of chili and went perfect with the crab.So the positives were to be expected, the crabs are fantastic, and well worth the trek to AMK. Their are a few suggestions I have:* put prices on the menus. Yes, I know seafood is at market price, but even the veges on the menu are not priced. It is great that service charge + GST are included, but everyone should do this.* the tofu combination is below par* take credit cards and lose the whole no 100% guarantee crap - no-one advertises their terrible customer service",

It was at a kopitiam in one of the HDB estates in Ang Mo Kio; the environment was bustling and filled with hungry customers. The Mellben signboard hung high and proud on top of the shop. There was no price list for us to reference, it was just talking to the person who took orders and praying it all won't be too wallet-busting. The range for crabs is generally $50 - $60, depending on market price. We had the chili crab with the fried buns for dips. The gravy was sweet with generous pools of eggs, the claws were full of juicy crab meat, but other than that, it wasn't very memorable, especially for the money that was spent. Crabs are already good to begin with and I've tasted better ones elsewhere.Be prepared for long queues during peak periods.",

Employees barely speak English for those out of towners. Make sure you plan your ride back and forth from the restaurant because it's not exactly in a populated area where there is tons of active cab activity although it is right off of a bus station. However, if you're visiting the area for the first time and you are unfamiliar with the public transportation system this may not be the best place to go for a first dinner. The yelp listing said it closed at 11 when I went on 1/20/13 but they really close at 10pm so I didn't actually get a chance to try their food. But be warned this place is as casual as it gets.

You are warned. Make reservations though they do not take it during the 15 days of Chinese New Year. Now why the crabs? The crab bee hoon soup is just very tasty. The taste is similar to the fish bee hoon soup but this is sweeter and tastier. The butter crab is to die for. The butter cream is so tasty and perfect to dip the mantou in.

    "text": "Finally visited Mellben after YEARS of everyone telling me that we should go. Firstly, make reservations. If not, you'll wait for a long time. Even with reservations, you have to wait! Secondly, know that this place is pricy. If you're having crabs, be prepared to drop a good dime here. Estimate about $90 for a medium crab--good for 2 or 3, I think.We got the butter crab and crab bee hoon. Crab bee hoon is the classic dish here and everyone gets it. It is very good. Add more soup and bee hoon; it is worth it. The butter crab is good too, and has a more heavy flavor and is also very creamy. Both were delicious. The crabs are fresh and the meat is plentiful and succulent. After all, you're paying good money for these crabs.The other side orders are good too. We got rojak chicken, tofu with pork floss and mushrooms, and salted egg pork ribs. The salted egg pork ribs were not very meaty, unfortunately. Come here for crabs. The crabs are so good. It would have been 5 stars if it weren't so pricey, were less touristy and had a better reservation/queue system.",

Well this was the only spot I visited due to the amount of time I had here. \u00a0You can get crab cooked in different ways, but the most popular is the chili crab. \u00a0 And the fried mon taos seem to be popular and used to soak up the sauces. And don't be like me trying to muscle through some of the crab pieces. \u00a0I ended up slicing my finger pretty bad. \u00a0Ask for a cracker or something to get into it. \u00a0We ordered way too much food, but my cousins wanted to try as much as we could since it was our last night. \u00a0The food was bomb, but the price is super expensive. \u00a0I think the total came out to about 350 USD for the 4 of us. \u00a0We didnt make reservations but we only waited about 20 minutes for a table. \u00a0Highly recommend you to try out if visiting Singapore. \u00a0Just make sure you dont eat and jet, they have cameras and pictures of ppl who've done it before - lmao",

This outlet which I went is located at Ang Mo Kio, it is just located right below a HDB. I went to this place on 2 separate occasion and it's always bustling with people. There's a huge carpark located infront of the restaurant and fret not there's plenty of car lot. But try to avoid popping by during dinner time as this is a residential area so car lot might be limited.We order quite a number of dish that night and it was a treat by a friend therefore I can't state the bill for the meal. 1) Signature Crab Beehoon Soup 5/5This is a must to try, the broth make you go drooling and it's so flavourful as the beehoon and crab is cook together. I always ask for extra portion of soup as it's really very good.2) Salted Egg yolk Crab 4/5Anything cook with salted egg yolk is always so yummy. The crab is coated with salted egg yolk and the flavour just blend in so well which keep your finger locking good3) Butter Crab 4/5Oh my, the mantou really goes well with the butter sauce and the children keep dipping into the sauce with their mantou and crab. I think this really tells you how good it is. 4) Cereal Prawn 4/5This is one of my all time favourite, love the fragrant smell of the cereal and Prawn. They just simply blend in and the Prawn is so crunchy.If you ever pop by here, pls order their signature crab beehoon soup. Trust me it's really very very good.",

So my suggestion will be make an effort to call and make a reservation 1 day before.They are famous for their crab, the most famous dish will be the crab beehoon (rice noodles) soup. So you will see almost each table will have this dish. The soup are very nice have a strong taste of crab freshness, if you want more soup you may request for a bowl or two, but they charge for each bowl or soup.I also recommend that you try the butter and salted egg crab. You might want to skip the chili crab, personally I find it don't taste as good as lots of other restaurant in Singapore.The only problem I have with this restaurant is no Aircon, so get ready to sweat when enjoy those yummylious crab.",

For those who think it's a hassle to eat crab and don't usually think it's worth the effort, this place will change your mind =) I've also tried their famous crab bee hoon that comes in a claypot and actually like this better so if you have enough people, try both flavors.Making reservations is also highly recommended.",

    "text": "Friends recommended this place. They don't take reservations so the early arrival in evening could ease the pain of waiting in the long line. We had salty egg crab and crab noodle soup. The salty egg crab is deep fried and coated with salty egg sauce, it's a genius combination if you love the nuance taste of salty egg. Crab noodle soup is amazingly delicious, when drinking the soup it is like thousands of crabs dancing in the mouth. Although the crab is a little bit \"skinny\" - not too much meat inside, its flavor still captures my taste buds.",

    "text": "Best crab bee hoon and butter crab in Singapore!!Having been away from Singapore for long periods at a time, this is one place I always crave for. The crab bee hoon is super flavorful with the broth having a strong sweetness from the crab. The butter crab is heavenly and always leaves me licking my fingers. The wait here is VERY long, even on rainy weekdays so definitely do come early. The place is pretty hard to get to via MRT so you gotta drive or cab or bus here.You still have to wait for about an hour for take out because they cook your order on the spot and it takes about an hour for the crab bee hoon to be ready!Trust me, the wait is worth it.",

Maybe the only reason to give this place a second thought is the high prices. But ... I definitely would return again soon. HahaOh. Do go early to queue. No prior reservations are allowed. And the queue can stretch pretty far.",
