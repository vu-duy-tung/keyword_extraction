Highly recommended for vegeterians looking for something good. Husband and wife were also nice people! Heard tempers flare sometimes but did not notice at all lol.",

That I don't know, not eaten at many Michelin star to know that, and for what I ate I didn't feel like I was paying Michelin price (48SGD? For app, main and desert for lunch).All I know is, loved the meal, service (was served by co-owner/wife Manuela) and vibe (was very busy, but chilled out).Do make reservation and check it out. I sat at the kitchen bar overlooking the chef who came over to chat up this hungry traveller.",

    "text": "I have been meaning to try this place because firstly it's new and there's something about the simple menu that intrigued me. Came here on a Wednesday night, although I had a rsvp, the place was not crowded at all and it seemed like you could even do a walk-in (if you hate to do a booking). Setting is more of a casual establishment, staffs are pretty friendly. The food:Ocean trout as appetizer - love the combination of tangy buttermilk, with a hint of yuzu. $22Rangers valley ribeye- thick meat, excellent marbling, well seasoned, simple and tasty especially with a dash of soy sauce. $55Barramundi with leek, bonito butter & caramelized onion - love this dish a lot too specifically both the butter and onion, they get along perfectly like bonnie & clyde. $32Rhubard with ginger caramel, lingonberry ice cream & roasted white chocolate - now this is mind blowing and this is coming from a person who doesn't really like desserts in general. This dessert is so creative, so delicious, such an excellent creation. We had to order this 3x because it's SO GOOD. It really is my kinda dessert. $15At least I know now where to get my dessert when the sugar craving strikes once a month. On an unrelated note, I personally don't like the presence of fans there, annoyingly disturbing and unnecessary. The aircons were blowing so strongly as well and in a weird way. When I asked them to adjust, they said it's not possible. So for those ladies who are sensitive to a strong fan blow like me, a shawl/cardigan is totally recommended.",

    "text": "I had high expectations of Cheek by Jowl. The food-sphere celebrity endorsements, the comments from my friends and coworkers, I expected my meal here to blow me away. I expected to stand up to Humpback, slap it in the face, and wrest my heart away with aplomb. Long story short, the meal was... above average but not unspectacular, and my favourite (not-ridiculously) expensive restaurant of the moment remains Humpback. But enough about Humpback; what went right and what went wrong and what went eh maybe at CbJ?Positive highlights: the Ocean Trout. The trout was delicious. Well executed, the flavours were fairly delicate, not in your face. It was a dish I'd order again, but not unique or novel enough that it's \"worth coming back for\". The much heralded confit duck with waffles... this dish. Wow. That five-spice caramel. The cucumber and mint salad on the side. This dish isn't a \"fine dining plate\" where you eat all the components together. This was an elevated chicken and waffles, fatty and sweet and rich and delicious, and the salad on the side is so you can refresh your palate and keep going. It's not a subtle dish by any means, it's a kick the door down and go HEY THE FLAVOUR IS HERE GUYS GUNS BLAZING dish, and while that might not be for everyone, it was possibly the saving grace for the evening for us.The black olive cake drew mixed reviews, but since this is my Yelp account, I'm going to say I loved it. It was clever. A brownie-looking cake that was slightly savoury, crumble that wasn't crumble (caramelised white chocolate crumbs) cream that wasn't cream (yogurt)... it was a dish of diverse elements, and as a slightly savoury dessert, my favourite kind.Oh shout-out to the padron peppers and hasselback potatoes. Solid small plates, those I'd order again without hesitation. Definite no-nos: Really, only the venison. Served under cucumber (or was it zucchini), with wasabi and fermented? Pickled? Plum, the plum destroyed the dish. A tart, acidic sauce like an inverse version of the plum sauce you see with roast meat at Cantonese restaurants, this tart gelee overpowered everything. All you could taste was SOUR. No matter what you ate off the plate, if you didn't first scrape off that dastardly gel, all it would be was SOUR. Urgh. I grimace just thinking of it.Everything else was... good. Not knock-it-out of the park good, but good. The slow roasted beetroot was excellent, right up there with most renditions I've had, but beetroot and goats cheese isn't rocket science, and it was served with puffed rice that had a granularity to it akin to sand. Not all of it was bad, but I had some mouthfuls were I was worried I'd chip a tooth, or felt like I was chewing on... sand. Yes. The Roasted Pumpkin? Just toooo many things going on the plate. Pumpkin. Nuts. Cream. And a relish? Wow. Just tooooo many things there guys. The Wagyu steak? A touch overdone when they seared it after the sous-vide (we're guessing they did a sous vide, the amount of unrended fat and perfect interior was unreal), the bottom and edges of the steak were effectively well done. Practically crisp. \u00a0Service was good. Friendly, eager, but not perfect. There were minor slip ups here and there, like offering dessert when we still had a main yet to arrive, putting a wine glass on our table when we hadn't ordered anything yet... but then even though we order the potatoes seconds before our main arrived at the table, it still arrived in time to accompany most of it because the kitchen clearly rushed it for us.All in all, Cheek by Jowl has some things going for it (the service team really is quite good, bar the minor not-critical mistakes), and I think the restaurant can only go up. Would I go back? Yeah if someone told me they wanted to. Would I opt to go back again on my own? Not at this point no.",
