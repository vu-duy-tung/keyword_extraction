I know my fellow reviewers say that its the perfect post-Zouk clubbing spot, but honestly, I know for a fact that revellers from Mink and Butter come to this perennial popular supper spot for food too. Food wise, Spize has an extensive menu. It serves local classics like prata and roti john. Portions are pretty sizeable - which might not be the best idea if you're going directly to bed after this, but it sure helps in soaking up alcohol. Some drawbacks to Spize though are its spotty service, and the non-existent parking available. But considering the location, I think you'll be hard pressed to do better.",

    "text": "You can love it or hate it but Spize is a necessary establishment in every party-goers life. If you're done at Zouk and need food, and you probably will, skip the amazingly overpriced food stand outside zouk that serves no purpose but to rip drunk people off. Instead, head straight to Spize which is so nearby, will still be open and has food that tastes good whether or not you're intoxicated. The menu is really extensive, as is the seating. As a vegetarian, there are plenty of options - the usual nasi goreng and mee goreng (both about $4, as there are a few kinds) can all be done veggie style, though you might want to repeat your order a few times to make sure they get it right (this goes for anywhere, really). More favourites are the drinks like ice limau (lime) and longan. The Blue Longan drink is awesome as well. It's basically just processed fruit and colouring, but it's exciting. Because it's blue. Who needs cocktails, right?",

Came to Singapore expecting some bomb Indian food since Indian is one of the major ethnicity...only to be disappointed. My search for tasty Indian food has been disappointing...until I found Spize.Whether it be a night after drinking or a random meal, Spize has been one of the most delicious Indian food I have ever had. That Mutton pancake thing with the dipping curry is so freaking amazing. To be honest, I have yet to try the other dishes but if it's anything like that, i'm excited to try more of the dishes. Not much to say about service, just standard. I mean if anything the food came out a pretty good time considering how busy and drunk customers there was. haha.The environment I usually go to is post clubbing/Zouk so there's not much to say about it. Just drunk Singaporeans! haha.My search for good Indian food in Singapore will continue but at least I have Spize!",

    "text": "So many people in Singapore drone on and on about the fact that Spize serves up prata inferior to other outlets. I am not disputing this. But every place has its own utility and its own niche. Spize covers the \"post-clubbing drunk-crowd\" niche. And it's a great niche to cover because, let's face it, when you're drunk you could probably pick up a yoghurt-lid slathered in bird shit off the ground and devour it as if it were three-star Michelin fare. Hooray for drunks!I will admit that I'm drunk almost every time I come here. And I come here a lot. It's basically a ritual. I don't care that there are other late night options in Singapore, such as Geylang and what have you. What I want late at night after drinking is prata + teh tarik and Spize is the most dependable and easily accessible option. The food is pretty good guys, come on. And you get to be in the company of your fellow drunks and party goers. Always fun! We even get the benefit of fairly dim lighting so that we don't have to be subjected to the seemingly rapid deterioration of our fellow patrons under harsh fluorescent lighting (exacerbated by our impending sobriety).By the way, even though I order the exact same thing every time I come (cheese egg prata and teh tarik less sweet), I have been very pleasantly surprised by the crayfish. Try the crayfish!",

The food comes in pretty huge portions and is satisfyingly greasy. I would say the out-of-the-wok dishes like kway teow goreng, mee goreng etc are pretty good but the prata not so. The roti john is pretty good. Drawbacks: the prices are pretty steep for an Indian-Muslim place (probably because of it's location) and parking is problematic. A lot people just park illegally on the street because there just aren't enough parking lots. But if you're coming here post drinking, you shouldn't be driving anyway!",

There's a HUGE variety of dishes to pick from, so you'd be spoilt for choice. They have all kinds of pratas, both sweet and savoury, as well as murtabaks to choose from. I like the mutton and cheese murtabak. It's huge and stuffed with ingredients.Rice or noodles? Take your pick. Most of the fried rice or noodle dishes here are pretty standard. Satay here is decent, but pricier than most other hawker centres. In fact, all the local dishes here cost a little more than average.There's also a western menu available, but I've never tried any of those dishes. Neither have my friends, so I can't really comment on that.The toilets here are usually filthy, and the floor is really oily. Tread carefully, especially if you are inebriated. They set up rows of tables and chairs on the walkway outside their shop, and the next 3 shops on either side.Parking around here is a real pain when you've got the post-party crowd in. Most people park on the streets illegally. Watch out for drunk people crossing the road as well, as some of them park on the little streets across the road from Spize.",

The Nasi Lemak came with this delicious spicy chili sauce which was amazing, and the rice and egg were perfect. The burger was cooked about medium well (we weren't asked), and had an awesome spice/herb flavor. Topped with grilled onions, Swiss cheese, and an egg. Fabulous.

Hehe Post-clubbing food, albeit not much hyper-active past midnight activities for me these days. What I like from here is Maggie Mee Goreng THAIII~ You gotta emphasize on the THAI so that they don't give you maggie goreng in RED colour! Plaster prata is a hit or a miss here, sometimes I feel like sending my plaster back so that they could give me a beautiful yolk but they are pretty busy most of the times I visit. One of their nasi goreng is quite delicious, especially with the accompanied samballll. The iced teh limau, which is iced lemon tea and teh halia are pretty good as well. What I dislike from here is probably the smokers' corner and the dust from the road. But guess what? I have been successfully avoiding these two since I found out they have delivery services and satisfied my crazy hunger pangs at 3am! :D I could then sleep soundly without being grouchy. Be minded that the waiting time is approximately an hour.",

After my quick fix of truffle fries elsewhere I came here with my friend.Ordered mee Bandung after wondering what it is. The food came after 10 minutes or so as there were quite a number of people before and after us. The food presentation was colorful and there are quite a few ingredients in it - eggs, cauliflowers, a piece of prawn and chunks of chicken. The sauce is like mee rebus' but added with chilli. It was not thick nor runny so it was perfect with the yellow egg noodle when combined.My friend ordered nasi goreng kampoeng without chilli or chilli sauces. She commented it was alright.For dessert, I tried prata bomb. The prata is sweet and it has two melted sliced cheese on top and a side of curry sauce. Right way to end my late meal :)Mango selaseh was quite good to especially when eating mee Bandung (Perspired a lot). Overall, worth the bucks I'm spending :) Service was still fast and efficient even though crowds were trickling.",

It has all types of cuisines from burgers, pastas, and nasi etc. So I supposed great for a group with particular choices. Basically I feel it's an upscale hawker restaurant. That's not an insult. It's what I hope to get at a hawker stall but never had. Actually hawker stalls are the worst food in sg. It is a bit more expensive than a hawker stall but worth it in the extra execution in the food. Cons- Maybe you find it charming the outdoor eating but you'll also have find charming the sounds of cars whizzing by. I'll try more things here as this is a bang for buck place.",

On and off, it's quite near my home making a regular late night supper destination.I'm surprised that the food is so well received because for me it's always been mediocre. But that's not what Spize is about after all. It's not there to be serving you amazing Indian food, it's there to fill you up in the middle of the night after a long day or work or after some frenetic dancing at Zouk. It helps then that they have a wide range of options, so no matter what drunk-munchy craving you have, they've got something that'll probably hit the spot. It says a lot that they're constantly expanding (they just took over the unit next to them), and I expect Spize to be around for many years to come.",

    "text": "To a late night party goer, this is paradise. The most extensive range of late night food you could probably ever find, and when you're tipsy, or tired, or happy, the food will still taste great no matter what. Even sober, the food here doesn't disappoint, and while it's no Tony Roma's or Chilis, but they do offer a great variety of Western and local wares to keep you satisfied.I am a big fan of the fact that they server truffle fries here. Truffle fries! At 3 am in the morning, truffle fries are a godsend. Haha jokes aside, I have seasoned truffle fries connoisseurs tell me that the ones served here aren't half bad at all. Their food options cover the whole spectrum, from your fish'n chips, to prata, they have almost anything you could think of whilst inebriated. Or sober.Here are a couple of the dishes I have tried which are mention worthy and some you should definitely try when visiting Spize. Their roti john chicken special - cheese, mushroom, chicken goodness on bread. Their maggi goreng seafood pattaya - maggi, with seafood and a tinge of orange spicyness wrapped in a hot omelette, nuff said. Their truffle fries - as mentioned above. Their fish and chips - fried crispy goodness with tonnes of fries. Their bangers and mash - good ol' sausages with creamy mashed potatoes and an equally tasty gravy to match. Their nasi goreng - they've got multiple variations of fried rice, be sure to give them all a try. There's a reason why there's more than one type. I could go on but you get the jist. I think the magic in this place is that it comes alive late at night, and is always full of sights and sounds way past midnight. Fantastic for eating those post party blues away. Also fantastic for drunk people watching at 4 am in the morning when you are hungry and cannot go to bed. Their only downside, when it gets crowded, be sure to expect that orders will slip through the cracks, and you may end up waiting for some time before those truffle fries finally arrive at your table.",
