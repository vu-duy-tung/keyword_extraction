    "text": "We found this place through a local friend and when we went there the taxi driver was surprised we knew about the place (as we are expats). The place gets packed on a Friday or Saturday night so make sure you have a reservation. Best to go with a large groups so you can try multiple kinds of crab. \u00a0Also, come early or reserve crabs as they have run out on busy nights.Hua Yu Wee is an old style old crab restaurant in an old house with a huge outdoor seating area in the back. Years back this restaurant was on the coast but thanks to the land added to Singapore over the years it is no longer on the coast. It is the last of the old restaurants still on Upper East Coast road.The food here is great and if you know what to get you can get a great meal for about 30% less than you'd pay at one of the name crab restaurants in East Coast Park or along the river. My wife and I much prefer the crab at Hua Yu Wee to that from Jumbo or No Signboard. We particularly like black pepper crab and it is wonderful at this place. As for the chilli crab it is also very good and not as sweet as at Jumbo, much tastier and better for soaking up the sauce with your buns. We've also had the salted egg crab which is good but very hot (thermally). They also have very good fried baby squid, drunken shrimp and excellent fried rice. Overall the Chinese food is very good and a great complement to the crab. You can bring your own wine, which is great and they will give you an ice bucket for cooling the white. Otherwise they have beer at decent prices for Singapore. Service is hit or miss, you will get served your food in a reasonable amount of time after you order but sometimes getting the check is a challenge.",

    "text": "Spent $350 here on 6 people. The crabs are about $100 each, but they are large and fresh. Everything else is relatively cheap. I'd suggest getting a couple crabs, some noodles, a vegetable dish, fish soup and Roher the chicken or prawns. Or both! For beverages, it is popular to get coconut juice, served in the coconut. You can also get fresh lime or watermelon juice. I believe they have beer as well. You can choose from different sauces for your crabs. The most popular is probably chili crab. It's not really my favorite, as it kind of reminds me of spicy ketchup. But it's nice with some steamed mantou. I prefer the salted egg crab. It was a little greasy the last time we came here, but I like the \u00a0sweet saltiness of salted egg and it's a little less messy. Apparently, the crabs come from Sri Lanka. Idc, they taste delicious. The service here is good, too. It gets very crowded on the weekends, so try come on the weekdays or make reservations:)",

Drunken prawns- excellent- fresh. Fried rice- decent, but nothing special. I'd pass on this if I came again. Seafood vegetable hor fun- average dish. \u00a0Beef with scallions- solid rendition but not blow your mind. A nice complement to the crabs. The crabs were obviously the star of the show- otherwise I wouldn't give this place a 4 star rating. Both the chili crab and the pepper crabs were pretty amazing, and they alone are worth the trip out of the city center to eat.",

    "text": "Hua Yu Wee is an old school Cze Char housed in a Colonial bungalow along upper East Coast Road.Restaurant is known for its nostalgic feel and pocket friendly Cze Char dishes.Given a Friday evening, the place was bustling with people, young and old. Given this, dining is only make possible with reservations even though restaurant have extended its seating into the backyard area. Servers were dressed in Kerbaya which reminds me of Singapore Airlines where our air stewardess are all dressed in such traditional costumes.Best is parking is free and even if the parking lots are full, valet parking is available without additional cost.Going straight after the main gate will be where the diners gather. However if you are wondering where did they prepare the food, well if you look closer on the left side after entering the main gate, you will see a block perpendicular to the main dining area where you heard lots of hitting noises from the wok and pans, that's the one.Looking around the tables and it seems to be a popular dish in Hua Yu Wee. It was sweetly coated in sauce and all I can say that its crispy and gave a good cracking feel when you bite on it.Deep Fried Baby Squids - $12.84The Tofu was good. The perfection of a little crispy on the outside cradling the soft silky tofu inside where the top layer was cover with spinach, assorted mushrooms and enoki. The sweet and starchy gravy was so pleasant and moreover with the enoki, they give the dish an extra bite.We all like healthier choices and for the greens we had stirred fried broccoli with garlic. Simple food like this is comfort food as the gravy tastes good with a bowl of plain rice.Garlic with Broccoli - $10.70 / $16.05 / $21.40Oh yeah! Oatmeal with prawns was definitely fragrant. Prawns were fresh and plump. Surprisingly, the fried oatmeal were pillowy soft. Prawn with Oatmeal - $20.33 / $40.66 / $55.64The entire chicken was very well deep fried and preserved. It was such tasty that I had a thought I'm attending someone's dinner as the service was good with servers dividing out into portions for the table of us.Feng Sha Chicken \u98ce\u6c99\u9e21 - $32.10Given the traditional place, Salted Egg Yolk crab is not in the menu, however they do serve the common ones like ketchup with chilli, black pepper, salt and pepper baked, deep fried butter and steamed crab. Crabs were all charged at $7.28 per 100g.Steamed CrabWe ordered the most original recipe and did not expect it to turn out so well! It was all impressive, at least to us with its most original flavour without additional sauces it was tasty in its juiciest and plump fresh. On top of that these crustaceans were placed on a bed of steamed egg which makes it presentable and unique in its style. Steam eggs were silky, light and refreshing. Believe me, I cant simply stop at one spoonful.Next will be crab again but served in the mixture of Tomato Ketchup and chilli sauce. The amount of spice was well balance out by the ketchup. Meat was as fresh and plump. However, more votes will still be given to the original steamed crab.Take these lovely Mantou for a dip inside the spicy chilli sauce and soak them up!When all yummy food fills our tummy, here comes the complimentary food from the restaurant. We have a platter of 2 melons, watermleon and honey dew melon. They were served chilled and tasted sweet.Being the first timer there, even though the environment may seems a little bit of chaotic initially, I would say that servers were all professionally trained. We are dining in big groups, occupying 2 tables and service was rather prompt without having our serving mixed up with others. As a whole, I like the place as it is good for gathering and family dinners. Even if you are there to celebrate your birthday, they are there to help you play the birthday song in the background for you!",

    "text": "This is the restaurant I will go for seafood in Sg. In fact I have been their loyal customer for more than 10 years now. Seldom really ever disappoint as far as the quality of the seafood is concern. The restaurant is so consistent in the freshness and taste of their seafood that I have literally \"stop\" going to other seafood restaurants. But of course, like most restaurants they don't provide the best of service when they are busy. But I can live with that as long as I get quality seafood..... Here are the reasons why they are top of my mind when come to seafood especially when you are after the crab dishes.1) The crabs were always fresh...... How many of you like crabs with meat that are soft and soggy?? Seriously, never once I have to make comment like the meat of the crabs were too soft. The crabs were always fresh, packed with meat and the meat are usually always firm, juicy and chewy. The only imperfection is that sometime the crabs were not packed with roe.... but of course it depends on the season too... so this is not a major issue.2) The best combination... crabs full of roe with sweet chili gravy. We will always order 2 crab dishes when we visit. Chili Female crab, and Black pepper Male crab. Female crab occasionally are packed with roe though they usually have lesser meat and smaller. Reason being the REAL STAR of this dish is the \"gravy\" and \"crab roe\" rather than the crab meat. The roe of the crab has a very unique aroma and coupled with the sweet mild chili gravy it just bring out the sweetness and favor of the crab. I personally like the sweet chili gravy though this is a personal preference. The gravy is not too spicy and it has more of a tomato taste rather than chili which is something that I prefer. The gravy is also very smooth and slightly sweet and has a tint of garlic flavor. Order fried mini buns and dip them into the gravy and you will be surprised how good a simple fried bun can taste.... So if you are there order the chili crab if possible a female one with roe and also fried mini buns to go with.... Ha ha a word of caution though... the crab roe has very high cholesterol content.... : ( \u00a0 \u00a0 but who cares... Next, Black pepper crab. We usually like to chill out with a couple of drinks. Black pepper crab with cold fresh beer is just plain heaven...... : ) Tried with red wine but still prefer to go with cold beer. This dish is kind of spicy though as it is packed with cracked black pepper corns. In my opinion they serve one of the most delicious black pepper crab in Sg (have tried some more popular one, but the crab meat sometime disappoint so imo they serve one of the best). We usually order this dish with a male crab because they are usually packed with meat especially their 2 gigantic pincers. The crab is covered with generous amount of cracked pepper corns and onion. You will be able to taste the sweetness, juice of the crab meat and the aroma of the cracked pepper corns with every single bite.... Down it with a gulp of cold fresh beer to complete the indulgence... it is pure pampering at its best... : ) \u00a0We will usually finish the chili crab first then go for the black pepper crab with beer....3) They serve live seafood... so the freshness is usually pretty much consistent.4) Parking not a problem..... : ) Fortunately for a small restaurant like this one parking is not a problem because there is valet parking. Just pass the key to the valets and they will do the rest. Tip is usually $2-$5. Parking is free.5) Must try...Chili Crab (female) order fried bun to go withBlack pepper crab (male)Mee gorengSteam bamboo clams with chopped garlic (think only serve occasionally)King pork ribFried crispy baby squids (goes well with beer)Deep fried half/whole chicken (I kind of like it, but may be too salty for some)The rest are pretty normal.... but definitely worth a try",

No surprises here as this mansion has been here for the last 50 years! Lets get down to the food :Crispy sotong : Definitely my favourite. The crispy sotong was fried well and had none of that oily residue taste. Together with the dark sticky sauce, this dish definitely went well with rice.Sharks fin: the broth and stock was good but I felt the sharks fin had too firm a texture. Would rather spend the money on the cheaper fish maw.Hor fun - A tad too salty for my taste but the wok hei is really good and the generousgravy delicious. A very enjoyable fish.Chilli crab - very solid crab although I found the sauce lacking. However it has it's own charm with a good spices with a little sour twist. Personally I like to compare all my chilli crabs with the Geylang no signboard crab... So that's my benchmark. Many old customers rave about the chilli and pepper crab so.. Take their word for itWill be back to try the pepper crabs as well as the tofu",

    "text": "If I'm craving for chili crabs, this is my number one go to spot. I can't remember the number of times I've trooped down, ordered one chili crab upsized, one vegetable, and a plate of fried buns as a comforting dinner. HYW is an old colonial bungalow with a large open seating area out back. There's also a very large separate kitchen by the side. Kids love to crowd along the kitchen and gawk at the chefs in action from the windows, much to the latter's amusement. I usually like to sit al fresco during seafood dinners as the ambience is more kampong like. Also, the A/C inside tends to cool the seafood down too quickly, which detracts from the flavours. Sitting outside is better for conversations too, as the insides get too echoey and loud from the other tables. \u00a0I've come here for a couple of birthday dinners, and recall fondly the pumpkin soup we had. Thick, sweet and savory at the same time, it made a great start for the night. The chili crab is unbeatable. The sauce is thick but not overly spicy, and has chunky bits of egg and roe in it. Also, it doesn't turn runny after a while, unlike those in many other sub par seafood restaurants. Dunking fried man tous into the sauce and savoring the sweet, fluffy insides has to be one of life's greatest pleasures. I quite like the mee goreng too - it used to come with fries inside, though they seem to have gone missing off late :(Parking is a killer here, and there are many idiots who haphazardly leave their cars in strange spots to block one's way.",
