I always add the fresh cut chillis and the house made chilli sauce for an unbeatable one two punch of spice. Their chestnut drink helps kill the heat if you've over done it. When feeling extra hungry I add an order of the chicken patties, mmmm crispy fried goodness. Give it a try if you're in the area.",

What more can you ask for?I've always wanted to try the lei cha from Joo Chiat and when I finally did, i was definitely not disappointed! I think what makes this stand out is the soup! There's something about it that differentiates it from the other ones i've tasted! I can't put a finger on it but there's just something different! ahahaHowever, i wouldn't recommend eating in the actual restaurant because it's pretty hot and stuffy inside. What i did was take away!Definitely would be returning! :)",

Flavorful and healthy with different ingredient textures to excite the mouth, this is definitely one of my favorite foods in Singapore!This outlet is not as spiffy looking as the one in Harbour Front, but the food was good (unlike the kind you get at Lau Pa Sat) and you pretty much get what you pay for.Thumbs up!",

    "text": "I want to come by more often. Really, I do. But as with all sites along the Katong, Siglap and Joo Chiat stretch, parking is pretty much a nightmare. Sure, there are lots around, but they're usually jam packed with cars. The restaurant is staffed with Chinese servers, and is usually deserted each time I pass by. There's a greasy feel to the place, from the menus to the tables, though I'm not sure why. The thunder tea rice comes in a generous serve, and drinks are fetch your own. I find the options here wide enough, though the quality of the food is rather pedestrian. In comparison to the thunder tea rice sold at Food Republic, I actually prefer the latter, perhaps due to its more bustling vibe. The Thunder Tea Rice outlet here feels uncomfortably like a ghost town to me, and I half expect a tumble weed to tumble past at any moment.",

    "text": "I eat this when I need to feel healthy--it's GREEN! The mix of textures and flavours is fun for the mouth, and you can always customise it re what toppings you don't want, and how soupy you want the tea to be. And you can even ask for the brown rice option, which I do, for extra goodness. It's not tea like cha-soba or tea-eggs--it's green, opaque and frothy, a mix of fresh herbs. You can add as little or as much tea to your rice as you like. It's not herby or medicinal, just green, though if you don't like that, the rice is perfectly good without the tea.I really like the fried bean curd with meat paste as a side, though unless you're starving (or greedy, like me), the thunder tea rice really is a self-contained meal.",

    "text": "It's simple, healthy, cheap and it tastes really good. For just $5 you get a bowl of Thunder Tea Rice, complete with the tea/soup for your rice and an option of a side of omelet or tofu. Perfect for vegetarians, you just need to inform the service staff that you'd like your rice without the anchovies and you're good to go. The peanuts, veggies and rice are all very veg-friendly! The place is usually pretty empty, but a consistent stream of customers, mostly regulars, keep business thriving. It's interesting to note that while Thunder Tea is pretty much seen as a womanly dish, plenty of young bachelors can be seen patronising this place. It seems going green is the new SNAG thing. If you're vegan, ask for your tofu without egg; they're really familiar with the various dietary restrictions of the different forms of non-meat eaters, so just remind them and you'll be fine. Interesting drinks in the form of juices and teas in a squarish bottle are also available; just help yourself and they'll add it to your bill. If the chilli isn't on the table, ask. Your meal won't be complete without it. :)",
