On the few occasions I had it, the skin was crispy and the fresh, juicy and tasty, with a flavour close to goose, Irish ducks are indeed more flavourful than the Malaysian ones we usually get here.",

    "text": "This is more like Imperial Treasure and Crystal Jade Kitchen fare rather than a proper Chinese restaurant with only dishes to order. So this is quite a do-able meal if you are not here with a big group or are dining alone. The difference will be a smaller menu as the focus is on the duck. The only meat available - duck, roast pork and char siew. Then you get the dim sum options with the usual suspects of siew mai, har gow, cheong fun etc. The rice and noodle dishes highlight will be with the roast duck. Congee is also available. I had the highly recommended black pepper duck bun which was nice. It was very saucy and while it was tasty, I felt the black pepper overpowered the duck flavor. The duck noodle was excellent. The noodle had a bite to it and when mixed with the sauce and chili was delicious. The duck had a rich taste due to the fattiness. I removed the layer of fat from the crispy skin. Unfortunately the skin was not crispy all the way. The duck was tender at some part and a bit drier on others so it was not consistent. Overall it was a good meal and I would come back again as it has more than just duck. A good option when you do not want to go to Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasure. The prices are decent too, slightly lower than the Noodle Place in 313 Somerset.",

Not sure that it was worth it. \u00a0I had also ordered the black pepper duck buns (all good - moist, tender duck, soft bun - except maybe a bit too much of the black pepper). Even for takeaway orders, the staff were a confused lot and what I would call 'cannot make it'.Today I had a late lunch in the restaurant. By the way, they have taken additional space (see photo). No crowd so service was much better than before. Staff was friendly.Had duck noodles and warm barley. \u00a0Duck was tender, skin not crispy at all. I had to remove the fat but alas the skin came off too. Barley was not even warm. Waiters and Waitresses in Singapore food outlets have a problem understanding 'hot', 'warm' & 'luke warm'.So my conclusion is that it is not 'die, die must eat'.",

    "text": "This Fat Duck is NOT for the skinny hearted.I've recently been seeing a lot of people try this place out and I knew, if it was good, would make the perfect Sunday brunch. We're happy we got here around 10.15am as the queue really started to pick up around 10.45 -11.00 am.First impressions... Service was a little slow. With only one main server taking orders, another 2-3 waitresses were running about getting the restaurant ready, turning on the tele which showcasing how their signature ducks are bred etc. After getting our seats... We noticed a huge amount of filth on their floor. Not a very good second impression. Used tissue paper and crumbs on the floor, clearly they weren't ready to open. We decided to ignore all that and concentrate on what we were here for, their famous duck.  Signature London Roast Duck ($12.80) $12.80 for an entire leg (drum and thigh) is pretty decent and comparable to the prices you get at imperial treasure or crystal jade. The skin itself was so wonderfully crispy, while the meat was juicy and tender. The health conscious maybe not be a fat of the thick layer of fat under the skin but hey, that's what they're known for.  London Roast Duck Rice ($7.80)We decided to ask for the breast this time around and we were not disappointed. Just as tender as the leg, the duck rice gave a good portion of meat along with a generous portion of fluffy white rice. Very very good. Signature Black Pepper Duck Bun ($4.80) Similar to a Bolo Bun, the top of the bun has a nice, sweet, \u00a0crunchy crust while the inside was filled with succulent duck, cooked with a tasty black pepper sauce (almost a hybrid between a char Siew and black pepper filling).It was such a delight the have!Pig Liver Congee ($7.50)Breaking away from an all duck brunch, we decided to order a Pig Liver Congee and see if it truly is a worthy challenger to Crystal Jade's crown. The texture was perfectly smooth and a worthy rival to many of the top Cantonese style porridge a in Singapore.The taste however fell a little short. It's not as \"porky\" or tasty in comparison while the liver was a little over poached. Will try the century egg Porridge next to see how it measures up. Overall, I'm giving this place a 4* solely based on food. Their manager or owner still seemed a bit lost while and looked drastically under staffed and not prepared for the flood of patrons and the cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. But at a month old, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and hopefully they will be able to stabilize the ship and really give the other Chinese restaurants a run for their money. But for duck's sake, please try the duck!b",

The duck has some flavour, some fat under the slighly crispy skin but because of the sauce, the crispiness of the skin is very much diminished. The roast pork was cold & not crispy at all with or without any sauce. The char siew leaves much to be desired, tasting overly sweet, overly charred like candy & not like barbequed pork. The rest of the dishes ordered siew mai, wanton in soup, xiao long bao are decent but also not very tasty. To compare the roast duck, char siew & roast pork, imperial treasure peking duck or crystal jade or even the local hawker stalls serves much better food! I do not recommend london fat duck.",

    "text": "With all the rave about the \"Wagyu of Duck\", I decided to try it out for myself. Let's start with the food. To be honest, the duck tasted pretty average to me. I personally prefer their Char Siew better than the Roasted Duck (and my girlfriends agreed too). Besides that, the rest of the dishes are alright. I won't say it's fantastic or like out-of-this-world. But if you do head down and try, do try their Duck Bun and Egg Tarts. That I recommend. Be warned though. With the expected waiting time (since they just opened and everyone wants a piece of their duck), the place was a little messy and chaotic. The plus point for them for our night there is the lovely wait-staff who was assisting us (just that one nice auntie) and that the food came almost instantaneously.Now, I can say \"I've been there, done that.\"",

    "text": "Ok why pay a premium here when you can easily get a whole roast duck at hawker centres for say SGD 25-30? Before we proceed, a duck here will cost you about SGD 50 after GST.If you don't already know, they do import their ducks from Ireland, which probably adds to the cost. But how different is it? I can only say it is very fat, very very fat, and I'm not kidding.Next, have so far only bought the duck to go, meaning I only get to consume it at least 45 minutes to an hour later. Typically the roast ducks that you buy to go will either be too dry or too soggy. They provide very high quality boxes which has a plastic container so to speak within the paper box. Given that it is very fat and oily, the crisp and moisture is still retained in the meat and crispy skin. Hence even after an hour or so has passed, the duck still tastes as good.This may not be the duck for everyone but if you like tasty, moist and crispy skin roast duck, I would highly recommend this.The other popular item is the black pepper duck bun which is not expensive and very tasty. I guess I will continue to come bere to get my roast duck until I can find a place that has roast ducks done so well and able to retain it's tastiness and crispiness for long.Do be warned that it is really very fatty and oily.",

It was a nightmare walking in and out the slippery floors.We had:1) Signature London Roast Duck ($12.80 for regular): gamey and chewy and dry. Terribly disappointing, considering its signature dish status. Suffice to say, we didn't finish this.2) Barbecue Pork with Honey ($14.80): saving grace of the meal and absolutely smashing. Beautifully caramelized with a sticky honeyed glaze, and meltingly luscious, this was perhaps the best char siew I've had in a while. I'll return just for this.3) Hongkong Wanton Noodle ($6.80): decent, if a little pedestrian.4) London Roast Duck Noodle ($7.80): disappointing that the noodles was better on its own, plain, without the duck, which was double whammy with its gamey taste and lean breast cut.",

    "text": "We were roaming around Scott's plaza and saw a huge crowd in front of the London Fat Duck at the basement. \u00a0I thought to myself \"this must be a hidden gem\". \u00a0So I suggested to eat here for dinner (on a Saturday night). \u00a0We waited for about 45 mins for a table. \u00a0We ordered quite a bit of food and was really eager to try it and see what the buzz is about. \u00a0The cracking pork belly came first. \u00a0There were 12 tiny pieces of pork on a huge plate. \u00a0The skin was barely had any crisp to it and tasted average. \u00a0The duck came next and we couldn't wait to dig in. \u00a0The skin of the duck was much crispier, like one would expect of a Peking Duck. \u00a0Flavor was great and the duck was really FATTY. \u00a0Way too oily for my preference. \u00a0The thickest fat was over an inch thick! \u00a0The beef stew noodle soup had an over powering star anise taste and the noodle was over cooked and soggy. \u00a0Same with the wonton noodle soup. \u00a0Wonton tasted average with soggy noodle. \u00a0Their signature charcoal duck bun was also a disappointment. \u00a0While the charcoal topping was crispy, the filling had way too much black pepper. \u00a0So all you could taste was the thick black pepper sauce. \u00a0The protein in side could have been anything because the sauce was so over powering that you can't taste much else. \u00a0The chicken feet was... \u00a0meh... by the time we got to try it, the oil/sauce had solidified to some oily jello consistency which wasn't appetizing at all. \u00a0We ordered three types of rice rolls--shrimp, char siu, and the special treasure roll. \u00a0The char siu and shrimp rolls were average, the special roll was another disappointment. \u00a0I took a bite of it right after the waitress put it down. \u00a0It had a rice roll on the outside, middle layer was supposedly a crispy egg roll type skin, wrapped with shrimp in the center. \u00a0The shrimps were over cooked and tough. \u00a0The middle layer was thick and chewy, no crisp at all. \u00a0The rice roll was too thick and not silky smooth. \u00a0At this point, we were scratching our heads and felt deceived by the huge crowd we saw. \u00a0The iced barley was really thick and not much barley taste. \u00a0The lemon iced tea tasted much better. \u00a0The surprise of the night was the egg tart. \u00a0It must have just came out of the oven. \u00a0The shell was really flaky and the egg center was just set and jiggly. \u00a0It was the best thing we had all night! For $150, our money would have been better spent else where for yummier food.",
