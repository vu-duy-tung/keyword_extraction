    "text": "I can only assume that the people giving positive reviews of this place are the owners because the food is legitimately among the worst meals I've ever had in my life. Putting aside the gimmick of eating in the dark, which is fun and different for a few minutes, a restaurant still needs to sell food that people want to eat, and this food is objectionable. Anyone who has a food allergy - don't even try eating here. Went in a group with a few allergies and vegetarians - almost everyone ate something they weren't supposed to and in one case narrowly avoided a trip to the hospital. The visually impaired staff that work here are great. That's the only positive thing I can say about the place. Other than that, I can only pray that you never are forced to eat here.",

    "text": "Have you all dine in the dark before? We all heard a fair bit about the concept of dining in the total darkness, haven't we? I think NOX need no further introduction.NOX is located along the shop houses of beach road occupying 2 level of shop space.The service staff welcomed us into the lounge and gave us a drink menu to choose upon. The moment I sat down, the plushy sofa seat reminds me of Gold Class Cinema lounge, quite similar in a sense. Servers explained there is no food menu to choose from, rather there is a secret menu at $88++ per pax that consists of 12 dishes spreaded into 3 courses, appetizers, mains and desserts. Restaurant menu will be change every 6 - 8 weeks and should you have any dietary preference, e.g. vegetarian, please highlight to them.MocktailA citrus combination of orange with a bittersweet finishing taste from a pomelo. Its more sour than sweet per say with grapefruit, lemon juice, simple syrup and Grenadine that give a tart and sweet flavour to the naturally sour fruit.Grapefruit Spritz - $14The zesty and minty flavours make this quencher such refreshing. Out of 3 drinks tasted, I rate this the best. Ingredients were close to other drinks with passionfruit, simple syrup, lemon juice, lime juice, fresh mint leave and ginger ale.Virgin Passionfruit Julep - $14Being described as not the ordinary strawberry milkshake, it really make me wonder how does it taste like. Drink was milky pink served with little ice cubes and a strawberry. It was more of sweet and less of the sour taste with fresh milk, vanilla syrup, simple syrup, lemon juice and Amaretto Almond Syrup.Strawberry Shaker - $14StartersWe were served with the starters with a vegetarian on the left and 2 mini cones on the right for the non vegetarians. The fried vegetarian had a pleasant scent of truffle oil smell and looks good with its creaming sauce at its base.Starters for the non vegetarian was miniature. Raw salmon was served in the tip of the ice cream cone biscuit added with caviar. The presentation which depicts some plants on the soil had totally taken me away.Before Proceeding into the darknessWe was told not to bring any of our belongings to the dining area and had them kept in the given lockers, not even our handphones or watches with illumination / glow in the dark function. Instagrammers, sorry! For those who needs to go toilet, its best to have the \"passage\" clear before entering into the darkness.Entering the DarknessWe were quite excited while the door to the dining area swung open and we were greeted by the service staff. Have you wonder how to walk up a flight of steep stairs in total darkness? Well, we conquered the first stage by having 1 hand tapping to each other shoulder in a line and walk up the stair and into the dining.Dining in the darknessIt all started with uneasiness, getting ourselves up at the dining area. When we reached our table, we were led to the back of the chair and have to figure ourselves to take a seat under the clear instructions of course. We were briefed to locate our cutleries (spoon and fork) and the position to place our drinking glass on the table. With every course served, we was told to lean backwards to our chair as these visually impact servers placed the dishes onto our table accurately. Each course consist of 4 dishes served in a wooden tray and placed in a \"t\" shape. The rule to dine is to start with the dish nearest to ourselves at the \"6\" needle base on a analog clock and go clockwise.It was a challenge as well as fun locating the dish and place our spoon correctly into our mouth without dropping off the food, afterall this was my 1st time ever dining under such environment. I vividly remembered that our appetizers consist of rocket salad, foie gras, fried calamari, chick peas, lentils etc. While the mains were duck confit, wagyu beef cubes, cod fish. Meat was tender and tasty. Desserts was lava chocolate, popcorn ice cream, lemon sorbet and strudel. Finishing the mealWe stood up and walk a few meters on the carpeted ground using the same \"tapping shoulder method\" in a line before heading back to the stairs. Luckily the stairs were dimly lit and we could see and walk down under the shades of light. As we proceed back to the lounge, our eyes were tired and as though we had just woke up.We were told to fill up a questionaire to recall and guess what we had eaten. After which, the person in charge will come with an ipad, showing the pictures and naming out the 12 dishes we had. We were surprised by our guesses as it really gave our taste buds a good test.ConclusionAll in all, it was a good 1.5 hours session of experiencing the life of a visually impact human, coping with darkness in their moves. We took our 5 senses daily for granted and being in such environment really gave us a good reminder of how lucky we are to be able to see, h",

    "text": "Such an \"eye-opening\" (sorry lol) experience. Not many pics available for the night as the dining experience is pitch-black. You get there, have a drink, learn about what's on the schedule for the evening and how the heck one is supposed to dine with 100% lights out! No phones, no glowing watches (those will be safely locked up before heading to the table).Go to the lou before heading upstairs!!! Your server will help you out if you realize you need to go later, but it's so much better to have an uninterrupted meal, especially in this setting.All servers in the dining area are sight-impaired- from severe impairments to full loss of vision... In other words they are complete badasses. They take your orders, clear your tables, balance dishes while avoiding other tables and servers all in the dark and WAY better than I ever could. They are funny and so nice.But this is their life! They want you to take away that even though blind people have this disability they can do SO much. So after a cocktail and a briefing, your server comes downstairs to lead you up the stairs... This is tricky at first but if you go at it slowly, it gets easier!They lead you to a table where they help you feel around and get acquainted with your space. Then comes the food!We were guided through 3 courses, each having 4 bite-size portions of different food. It was an entertaining test of palate and also a test of one's willingness to let go and engage the other senses. It really is amazing how much we rely on our sight. It was fun trying to understand what we were tasting without knowing what it was...Oh yeah! They don't tell you what you are about to eat (they ask before about allergies and preferences). Afterwards, they give you a questionnaire about what you ate and THEN show you on a tablet what all the dishes were. They are actually still gorgeous dishes! They do not skimp on the experience here.The servers were utterly impressive. They held more grace than a lot of sighted servers with whom I've interacted. They made guests feel confident and comfortable in a disorienting situation. Learning about your senses and sensations while also getting a real look into a moment of the lives of those without sight was enlightening! Being without sight is scary, but not as debilitating as you think. It's amazing what our brains do to compensate.This was an incredible experience. While there is a novelty factor going on, the food was amazing! There is a wide variety of dishes so you may not like a couple things but it's all very thoughtfully crafted, which is always appreciated. It was fun, and sometimes difficult, to pick out s favorite dish in each course.They switch up their menu every so often so going back is totally worthwhile. Next time I'm in Singapore, I will definitely be stopping by again.",

While making a reservation here, I didn't see any pricing on the menu so I kind of came here blindsided, not knowing how much we would spend. The experience itself was different.

If I had known that, I'd probably wouldn't have tried this restaurant. We could've hand good steak and overall, good food for that amount. If you got the money to spare, then try it.

    "text": "Very cool and enlightening dining experience. The downstairs staff are so friendly and professional as are the waitstaff. \u00a0The waitstaff are your guides who help you walk up the stairs into the pitch black dining room, help explain where all your utensils, food, etc. are and also help you with anything you need. You really do make a \"transfer of trust\" to your guide, and this in itself is a very illuminating experience. As for the food, very unique! At $78 per person it does seem a bit steep, but they do serve quality food and it is fun to try and guess what you are eating. There are three courses, but each course comes with 4 different dishes (which also means 4 different desserts, a big plus if you have a sweet tooth like me) so a lot of food to try and my husband and I were definitely full afterwards. \u00a0Eating in the dark also raises your other senses so I could hear everything very clearly, and relying on just your taste to experience food is definitely very different from when you can clearly see what you are eating (and maybe even unconsciously judge food just based on the appearance).I was also trying to be extremely careful not to knock anything off the table. I am normally a bit of a messy eater so eating in the dark didn't help that, and I did end up with some chunks of food on my lap ;) The menu changes every month and a half, keeping the novelty and surprise alive. We would definitely return! They can also accommodate different dietary requirements. One of the highlights was at the end of the meal when they take you back downstairs and you write down what you think each dish consisted of and they reveal what it actually was and also show you the pictures of each dish. It was quite surprising and funny to see how wrong we were on some dishes and satisfying when you are right. \u00a0The hostess pointed out an interesting trend about how what you end up guessing right typically indicates what type of cuisine or food you normally eat. For example, most of the food I guessed right was geared towards veggies, seafood, etc. but my most inaccurate guesses were the meat dishes. All in all, my husband and I had a very wonderful time at Nox - Dine in the Dark, and it was a novel and enlightening dining activity to experience with each other.",

We definitely spent a lot more time 'thinking' about and concentrating on the food we were eating, which made me realize how much I rush through my everyday eating experiences. It also did make my boyfriend and I giggle quite a bit as we tried 'toasting' in the dark as well as pouring water. Unfortunately I haven't given the restaurant more stars because I think it is overpriced for what it is. The 3-course menu is $88++ per person, add wine pairings (3 'small' glasses including a sickly sweet moscato at the end), plus 2 cocktails (as you spend 30 minutes in the bar prior to your dinner seating) and our bill was just shy of $370... Eek!!! Rather extravagant for a meal that I would call 'good' but definitely not 'fantastic'. I did like the quiz side of things at the end...something I was convinced was fish, then possibly chicken, turned out to be duck... and then they had one complete curve ball in there as well. Apparently they change the menu every 5-6 weeks so you don't have to worry about repetitive meals... having said that, I think this is something great to do once in your life but I wouldn't feel the need to return. My other suggestion? Update the music! It was like a 90s cocktail bar...",

    "text": "When my friends first spoke about trying out this restaurant, \u00a0it sounded really interesting although the inital idea of dining in the dark sounds rather daunting. We decided to take the plunge and met up for an early christmas dinner at NOX. We were very excited about this dinner and we prep ourselves that this would probably be one of our messiest dinner. Well, we were glad that we proved ourselves wrong as we left the restaurant as clean as when we got there. :) This got to be the most interesting restaurant concept that I have been though the price is a little steep. The tasting menu is good (The chef was previously from Ember and Private Affairs) \u00a0but what stands out from other restaurants is that this dining concept teaches us a life lesson on appreciating the finest things in life without sight. \u00a0Having \"surrendered\" our phones and any light illuminating gadgets to the lockers provided within the restaurant prior to the dinner service, it is back to the good old school conversation that is sorely missed. Finally, \u00a0a gathering without having the camera to grace our food before we partake our meals and also \u00a0no distraction of Facebook, what's app and another other social media to distract us. Not to forget that the guide who is visually impaired did a great job with the dinner service. \u00a0He taught us how we can navigate around our new found surrounding and making us feel 'at home'. He shared with us how he turned visually impaired yet he is still very optimistic about life. We spent most of the time pacing ourselves with our friends and guessing the ingredients and dishes since there is a \"pop quiz\" at the end of the dinner. \u00a0We looked forward to moment where the hostess revealing the \"secret\" dishes. We were very excited that we got 70% of the dishes correct! :)It is not a restaurant that I would visit everyday but it is definitely a good experience and I do encourage everyone to check out this place at least once to see a different side of life.",

    "text": "Dining in a pitch black room, served by blind waitstaff. When I heard about this from a friend I met in Thailand who just happened to be going to Singapore the same time I was, we made plans to do this and I'm so glad that I did because our travel partners were super lame and not adventurous enough to try this. This was undoubtedly one of the most interesting things I've ever done, let alone dining experiences. You're seated in the lobby with a menu to decide what you want; we did the \"ultimate NOX experience\" and I would highly recommend it. You start off with a small appetizer and cocktail downstairs. When you're done, you are led up a staircase and into a room with your hands on the shoulders of the person in front of you, hoping you don't bump into anything along the way because you literally can't even see your hand in front of your face. Once you're seated, your appetizers arrive along with your first glass of wine assuming you do the wine pairing. I'm not a wine-o by any means, but I was glad to have splurged for the pairing. You get a glass with each course, the first cocktail and coffee or tea at the end. Your server will describe where everything is on your table so you can feel it out. About by the time we were done with the first course, I think we had pretty much got the hang of eating in the dark. Muscle memory I guess, you just remember where you left your fork, water/wine glass, etc. So unless there is some other offerings, I think the standard is a three course meal consisting of 4 plates per course and you eat in a clockwise fashion starting from 6 o'clock to 3 o'clock. It really makes you use and appreciate your scent and taste buds since you can't see what you're eating and guessing what you're tasting/smelling really makes you question how refined your palate is or how far off you are from reality. Our waiter told us a little bit about himself and how he lost his sight and his story was pretty inspiring. At the end of the meal, you are led downstairs to find out what each dish was and it's fun to talk about why you thought something was what it was (or wasn't) with other people you were eating with. I enjoyed every dish, some of which I didn't like having had them before; I won't say what because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. This was extremely enlightening and I would suggest it for anyone whose never tried such a thing and are adventurous enough to not know what's coming your way.",
