After a small conversation with our waiter, who was extremely friendly by the way, we found out the place recently had a facelift. Located slightly off the road from The Central at Clarke Quay, this place serves one of the best Al Granchio's I've had! It is creamy, but without being too cheesy, and they're really generous with the amount of crab meat. Their starters aren't very wide, but their mussels with white wine weren't too bad.",

    "text": "I like this place. I came here once looking for pasta and decent Italian food and I think this is good pasta. I tried the 3 dishes in one plate, and the gnocchi really surprised me, it was probably my favorite dish but of course you can't have too much gnocchi otherwise your tummy just gets filled up. It's not like a high end Italian restaurant but I thought the food was good. I just have to continue to come back to make sure the food is consistent since I last came. But I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others based on my first experience. And I would recommend the gnocchi. The other 2 dishes was a crab meat pasta and lasagna. All are good but gnocchi stood out to me. We paired it with red wine as well.",

    "text": "Quite conflicted about this place, some parts of the dishes were good but there were others that were horrible. 1. Grilled chicken breast- Came with some sides, - Mash potatoes - So good! Buttery & rich :) - Salad - ok - Peach color cream was really yummy! - Chicken breast - Unfortunately the main star of the dish was sorely disappointing. It was dry and so tough to eat! Very blend too! If not for the aforementioned sauce, I am not sure how I would have eaten it. 2. Bruschetta & smoked salmon. - This starter dish came after our mains which was weird. - The Bruschetta was cold. It wasn't crispy or toasted :( Overall, despite some small hits we left disappointed with the food and will probably not return again. I read other reviews which suggest that their pizza is not bad but I don't think I could risk being served another disappointing portion of cold bread!",

Great value for the quality of food (deliciouso, specially their Mushroom Soup, and their desserts are to die for).Service is attentive, waiters even recognised me (for a moment of time I even used to come here every week because I loved it so!). Special mentions to their Ricciotti Salad ($13.50), Tagliatelle el Salmone ($21.50), and the Rustica (pizza, $23.50).",

I've not had the chance to try any of the mains or pizzas yet, but from the satisfied looks of other diners together with the aroma that arises from their orders, I can more or less be assured that the food is of decent standard. At night, Ricciotti's ambience becomes a tad more cosy and romantic and is quite a common sight to see dating couples enjoying a glass of bubbly or wine and staring into each others eyes.",
