From their hipster decor, to the yummy toasted almond latte, to the wonderfully sinful poached eggs, Group Therapy ticks all the boxes that a cafe should be. Nestled in the hip Duxton area, Group Therapy's entrance is rather hidden away, with only a signboard outside giving any indication of its location. But once you find the place, man, it's easy to while hours away there - people watching, or just hanging out with friends. And should you decide to go to this cafe - really, trust me. The poached eggs are to die for.",

On the menu this dish listed with salmon, but they swapped out the salmon with sauteed mushrooms for me with no problems. And they did not skimp on the mushrooms. Enormous doorstop of bread. Drowning in hot hollandaise. Yum. Not to mention that at $15 it's one of the lower priced versions of eggs benedict I've seen in Singapore. Another favorite is the minty mango passionfruit smoothie -- the mint is the 'twist' on the menu. I also love the rustic chic vibe of this shop house cafe, with lots of different types of seating areas. The very competent women who run Group Therapy are always pleasant. Great for a brunch spot, or a lunch spot if you want eggs benedict in the afternoon (I do) but I would totally fill up the place with friends for an evening do if I could.",

    "text": "We got here on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed. The noise level was significantly loud with no music, so if you would like peace and quiet, you could try this place on a weekday. I got the poached eggs with smoked salmon that everyone is raving about and it was good, but I wouldn't say that the eggs weren't beautifully poached. They were just....poached eggs. BUT, coupled with the smoked salmon on the thick slab of toast, and with the delish hollandaise sauce, the flavor combination really hit the spot. A great dish to have if you wanted something relatively light but still flavorful. The shepard's pie was tasty to me, but I do have a penchant for sweet and savory food. For those who does not appreciate sweetness in your salty foods, do not get it. The portions are pretty okay, but on the small side for a typical brunch. Worth a visit if you are around in the area craving some brunch, but not super delicious to go out of the way for.",

I had their Poached Eggs & Smoked Salmon ($15) on Thick Toast and roasted almond latte. The hollandaise sauce coupled with salmon on top of a thick, well-toasted toast was delightful breakfast food. Their roasted almond latte ($6.80) tasted of distinctively of almonds (duh). It was special because of the flavour, but not spectacular. The caf\u00e9 also comes with a selection of interesting beers and ciders. A creative vibe can be felt, as many artistic-looking types congregate to discuss work or just peace out. The venue is open for booking, I rememebr attending an event Group Therapy hosted for TED (TED.com), which I really enjoyed. The staff are friendly, patient and approachable, plus there are quite a number of powerplugs nearby - which makes it a prime place to get stuff done.",

    "text": "The first impression of the place was good- relaxing, \u00a0casual ambience, lots of delicious-sounding food on the menu. It quickly went downhill from there. My partner and I were seated at a table for four, nursing our drinks and conversing, when a waitress came up to us saying \"Excuse me, you're sharing this table with someone else.\" Those were her exact words. Now, I don't mind having to share my table with strangers if I had been warned of the possibility ahead of time and asked if I was ok with it. The way she put it was just insensitive. The other couple sat down next to us and the 4 of us sat in awkward silence. The table was small and we were literally rubbing elbows with strangers. As soon as another table freed up, they requested to change tables. Barely 10 mins later, another waitress came up again and said \"Excuse me, another couple will be sitting at this table.\" For the second time, our conversation died down. It was getting very disruptive. This time, the two companions were not shy about talking out loud. The first thing we heard was:A: \"How have you been?\"B: \"I've been sick lately.\"A: \"Really? Me too.\"Needless to say, \u00a0we spent the rest of our meal in silence, focused on eating fast and getting out of there. Food was decadent - I had the Croque Madame. The bacon was great and cheese was abundant. But in Singapore, where people eat not just for sustenance but as a way to relax and socialize, this place barely even made it on my list of go-to places for brunch. The sad thing is, Group Therapy's intended vision was to be a place where people connect over food.",

    "text": "I'm a bit torn about this place. I basically fell in love with it via yelp reviews and photos before ever going. But upon visit I felt pretty let down.The poached eggs and salmon on toast is the picture of my ideal breakfast. Thick toast, eggs, smoked salmon, hollandaise. In my mind it was delicious but in reality it was not. Realize I'm really breaking away from the trend of the reviews here so perhaps it was just an issue with mine...- the bread was hardly toasted and definitely not warm (consistency leads me to believe it was thrown in the microwave for a few seconds and then topped with the eggs and sauce, as the bread was tough and relatively hard to cut)- the eggs were hardly warm - the hollandaise sauce had a weirdly similar consistency to mayonnaise, and also was not warmI'm used to a breakfast dish such as this being served relatively hot, so \"hardly warm\" is rather unpleasant. No one likes warm (soon-to-be-cold) eggs.Usually in an eggs bene I am using the bread / muffin to soak up every last bit of the hollandaise, but in this instance I found myself scraping most of it off. I've never seen a hollandaise this consistency before, and I've had my share of it elsewhere. It seems like they mixed something into it so the sauce could be made in bigger batches and stand to sit around without constant stirring. If you've made hollandaise sauce before you know how temperamental it can be, and requires a lot of love and attention. Not mayo (or whatever additive was in there - it was not a pure egg/butter/lemon juice recipe). I really really wanted to love this place. My food aside, the redeeming qualities I saw were..- my friend's burger looked delicious- the ambiance is very cute- the beer list has some interesting options- the rest of the menu dishes look promisingI'm hopeful was just a fluke, and intend to give Group Therapy another chance, possibly for dinner. Unfortunately I'm just not in a rush to go back. There are a lot of other great looking places in Duxton I'd rather try first.",

    "text": "Group Therapy Coffee has a nice, laid back vibe that puts you at ease almost immediately. Mis-matched furnitures, decorative pieces and crockery dots the spacious cafe. A twinge of vintage, a touch of rustic and a dose of randomness works to the cafe's aesthetic advantage. It's a place that makes you feel like anything goes - a pretty rare occurrence in this day and age.Having been craving for a some egg benedict for quite some time now, I eagerly ordered a serving of poached eggs that came with smoked salmon, toast, gruyere cheese and hollandaise sauce ($15). Dessert is always a must, hence the lemon meringue tart ($6.50) and a cup of roasted almond latte ($6.50). I felt that the food was quite pricey for the potion given, its taste was decent but nothing spectacular. The eggs were nicely poached but the thick slice of toast sitting underneath it was a little too hard and dry. Fortunately, the runny yolk saved it from being too bad. I couldn't taste the gruyere cheese and actually forgot that it was part of the dish until I began writing this a few minutes ago. I'm now thinking they might have forgotten to put the cheese in but oh well.The lemon meringue tart was not bad, bursting with flavour with a tangy custard, coupled with a sweet meringue top. The only complaint was that the meringue was a little soggy, but I liked that the custard was filled with real lemon zest, that gave it a nice bite. The next time I need an escape from demands/datelines/work, I have a place to run to for some respite and perhaps some much needed therapy. Food or desserts aren't exactly their forte but a place like that, with its quirkiness, ought not to be overlooked. It's a pretty great place, whether for a meet-up with the girlfriends, or for chilling alone with a book. Just try not to go there hungry I guess?",

I have been here for breakfast, and I love the muesli yoghurt, although I would prefer to have a non-sugar version but that you cannot find in Singapore, can you...It is rather expensive, though, and opens very late. One morning I got there 20 min before they opened, and I was put off because I was not let in with my morning newspaper. You don't blame them, do you, but what harm could would it have done if I had sat quietly at a table reading my newspaper while they were opening up? It would have shown some entrepeneur spirit, and had made me feel valued. So I roamed the streets and got back as the first guest.I do recommend this place.",

It's not a bar, but if you're on Duxton Hill and craving a good beer, this is a good place to stop.",

After some research, we decided to head to Group Therapy and, boy, we were not at all disappointed with this choice. The poached eggs were absolutely delicious - served atop a thick slice of toast and smothered with a hearty, creamy hollandaise sauce. My only regret is that my partner and I ordered one each, which proved to be way too much for us because the portion was so generous. I suggest sharing one and getting something lighter for your second selection. It's casual, yet is evidently on the hipster's radar, so expect crowds, especially on the weekends.",

The decor is a nice mix of industrial and warm coziness, and the owners and baristas and waitstaff super friendly and inviting.The wine and beer list is also above average for a cafe of this type.

Group Therapy was brightly sun-lit and complete with the tinkering of teacups and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee accompanied with the muffled chatter of bosom buddies.The ambience is perfect - having been here on 4 separate occasions - loving it each and every time, each corner promises a different experience. There were many different sets of furniture, fit for the odd group of 5 or if it's just a corner for one, there'll be one waiting for you!",

There is a mixture of tables (standard and high) as well as couches that are available at various \"rooms\", giving visitors a number of choices based on your preference. I tried the Almond Latte which I found to be tasty, at $6.50. There was no queue and the coffee was delivered to my table a few minutes after I sat down after ordering at the counter. I brought a book to read at the cafe but found the ambiance a bit too noisy/social for me to have a peaceful read. Overall decent offerings in the Tanjong Pagar \u00a0area.

They also have other light bites like panini sandwiches, chicken ham pie, salads etc. There is also some simple main courses like a meat stew. W wasn't hungry so I only got to taste the Poached Egg. Fluffy toasted white bread. Crispy and nice on the outside. Very similar to that of Wild Honey. Nicely poached and runny egg yolks. Salty smoked salmon which were slowly cooked by the warmth of the eggs that rested nicely on them. And that hollandaise sauce is so cheesy and creamy!

    "text": "It's embarrassing when I rave about a place to my kakis and when I finally force everyone at gunpoint to grab a meal here, the food sucks.That's what happened a couple of weeks ago. My kakis at that time were a bunch of my colleagues including my boss.Up until then, I'd always been a fan of the WIld Mushroom Truffle Ravioli. The menu changes every week, last I checked, it wasn't on the menu.The raviolis must be hand-made (thumbs up). But this time, they were barely stuffed with anything. One of them had nothing inside (thumbs down).So, I won't be coming back here. I don't like guessing what kind of quality I'll get.",

If you're near outram park mrt or chinatown mrt, you can make your way to this cafe to chill or just to hang out with friends. This cafe's specialty is their all day breakfasts! I tried their poached egg with salmon and it is just heavenly~!Their salmon is fresh and off a good proportion. (Now just a thin slice of salmon) The poached egg is good as well. Not over cooked and under cooked. The sauce they used is hollandaise sauce and it compliments the whole dish very well. :)I will definitely go there again!",
