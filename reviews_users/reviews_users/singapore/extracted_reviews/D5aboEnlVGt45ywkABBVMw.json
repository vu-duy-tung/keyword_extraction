I like both the signature and the asam version.Not the cheapest, but sits in airconditioned comfort eating spicy food. Nicer then Al fresco.",

There was a little argument and I refused to pay for the drink.They are incredibly calculative and wanted to charge me for their mistake. There is no knowing what other penny-pinching tricks they may be up to in the kitchen.I will never be returning.",

    "text": "So I finally got the chance to eat here!!Assam Fish - we opted for fish slices version with Assam curry. The fish slice was the deep fried type you eat in fish soup. I thought its a little queer but still tasted good as the curry is good. It's not super Assam as it's lemak too. Kinda the best of both worlds. :)Golden Claypot Chicken - another awesome dish. Pre-fried chicken pieces coated wiTom Yum Soup - not great. Taste like it's made with instant paste. Can skip the next time. Sambal Lady's Fingers and Sambal French Beans with Prawns - both very good. Vege were stir-fried with good wok-Hei. Cannot stop eating. A meal here cost is $80 so while it's not cheap, it's very affordable. Will be back again for the nice and affordable fish head curry.",

    "text": "West Co'z Cafe serves amazing food options for westies, and is particularly a great option when you have a group of at least 6 people. They are well known for their fish head curry, which lives up to its hype. The seating here is great because they have plenty of round tables which can seat around 8 people. I came here for lunch during the week and found the group of 8 to be perfect in trying their set menu + few add on items ala carte from the menu.The restaurant is clean, well ventilated, and easy to find. Highly recommend!",

The curry chicken, Assam fish head, golden claypot chicken and other signature dishes are winners. The fried rice dishes also have the requisite 'wok hei' flavour. I think it's way better than most of the \"zi char' places around here.",

    "text": "I'm a resident of the West Coast area and when it comes to great food around here, it's pretty hard to match West Co'z Cafe. As other posters have pointed out, it's a venue that specialises in Halal \"zi char\" (stir-fry), so you get the usual dishes like sambal kangkong, hot plate tofu, shrimp paste chicken wings, cereal prawns, etc etc...basically the zi char experience in an air-conditioned mall (very similar to what you get at Far East Plaza), with a strong consistency across dishes.The specialty of this place is Curry Fish Head. Seriously, if you come here, just get this, otherwise you're just wasting your time here. It costs $16 and comes in a generous portion that feeds 4 (I get aggressive sometimes and order this even when there's only 2 of us here). You'll notice that every table has one of this and they do both the Nonya and Assam style, so pick your poison. They do enough quantities on a daily basis that it's fresh and cheap.One thing to note is that this place generally gets very crowded during mealtimes, but they do take your number and ask you to take a walk around the mall. Turnover is pretty quick, usually a 10-20mins wait, so don't get frightened off if they ask you to come back later!And oh, did I mention, a zi char place that takes American Express cards in Singapore? Yeah, this place is weird like that but so convenient!",

I also absolutely LOVE their lemon chicken rice! The cafe is located on the third storey of West Coast Plaza. The wait staff have always been very polite and attentive even when they're busy (which is almost always).The cafe offers a satisfying meal and I have not been disappointed with their food or service so far.",
