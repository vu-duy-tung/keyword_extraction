    "text": "I'm not sure why I didn't wander into this restaurant sooner since it's so close. Paleo? They sure make it easy to follow the lifestyle. Their menu features salads and meats with veggie sides in addition to the typical bakery delights. Good luck avoiding the breads and pasteries...they look delicious! So far, I've had the beetroot, pumpkin and feta salad (skip the feta for the Paleo folks), and it was awesome. Very fresh. I've also sampled their omelet with peppers, mushrooms and ham, which was also good. My favorite so far is their peri peri chicken ($22) because it couldn't be more Paleo with seasoned, grilled chicken breasts and veggies. Don't love too much spice? They put most of the sauce on the side. In the Killiney Road area and looking for something healthy? This would be my first recommendation. I'd go here daily if it was a bit less expensive!",

The staff are all quite young, perhaps that's why they're all bustling very busily to little effect. Tried the boeuf bourguignon pie - dug in and found peas and potato. Perfectly ok but that's not boeuf bourguignon so they should just label it a beef pie lah. Have to say they're very generous with the beef and the chunks were tender, not chewy. Good quality balsamic on the accompanying salad.  The portobello sandwich had generous stuffing of well seasoned portobello, but it was cold. Would be much better warm. The chocolate croissant wasn't buttery enough although it was ok. Chocolate eclair wasn't too sweet but again ok, no great shakes. Best thing was a lemon curd tart with a bracingly tangy curd - but then again I can make lemon curd, so um not blown away. Long black coffee tasted a little sour like it'd been percolating a while so I'd advise coffee aficionados to go for the lattes and mochas which have to be made fresh.",

Until yesterday, when i happened to walk down this way after coming back from town. Anyway, i came here for lunch so i didn't try the pastries (next time!).I had their roasted chicken sandwich, which was more like a baguette since that's what they used instead of soft bread. This was simple and really good! I don't normally finish the bread part of sandwiches in my feeble attempt to save some carbs, but i definitely gobbled up every last crumbs of this sandwich. The baguette is actually what makes it delicious, it's laced with different types of nuts and seeds which gives it that nice crunchy texture and savory flavor. I do feel the price is steep for just a simple baguette though. It was $11.80, I think i would have been more ok if it was $8-9.I got a long black and, like other reviewers, was disappointed. I expected such place to serve quality coffee, but it tasted like the coffee brewed in my office pantry and costed $4.80. I'll go somewhere else for my caffeine kick next time.They also have a brunch menu from 8am - 2pm!",

    "text": "I cherry picked my pastries based on visual-appeal. I swept sweet bakes like Vanilla & Raisin Swirl $3.50 & Orange Brioche off the shelve, and the former wins slightly but with low marks. The Danish presented in burnt rims, has a notable buttery flavor but not rich enough to remember. The sweet glaze blend gently with the flaky pastry partnering some scattered candies raisins. I wasn't really impressed with the taste, just mediocre.The Orange Brioche $5.00, was weaker in taste. It didn't sing any buttery tune like other artisanal brioche, no signs of flakiness and rather dry in its texture. There was a small helping of citrus scented custard piped in the middle of the dough, mildly sweet. The orange fruit slice hindered my chewing - simply aesthetically pleasing on the the sweet bread.The Madeleine $2.00/pc, was a decent piece. Not exceedingly sweet with a soft interior. I'd prefer it to be served warm like db Moderne Bistro so that I could taste the rich buttery structure in its comforting warmth. This one was left in the open, atop the pastry glass cabinet, side-by-side the Financiers. Obviously, it has been overpriced.The Kumara & Bleu Tart $6.00/pc, champ the fleet in my whole selection when its rivals failed to compete well. The soft and crumbly tart shell adapted quite well to the sweet orange-pigmented kumara cubes gelled together in a pool of coagulated cheese - buttery rich and very delightful. Noticeable flavor is seen coming from the flaky tart, less from the filling.The battle field continues to be less interesting when the limping Roast Chicken Sandwich $11.50, hit the ground. The fillet slices were dry and fibrous, no traces of flavor until my taste buds met up with the sweet onion chutney above the fresh lettuce. The hard-like-rock baguette made things worst, it was a total shame!When I thought nothing will be praised, I was charmed by the healthier fare, $8.50 - Quinoa & Lentil Salads. The power grains are executed in perfection along with a mixture of soft lentil which is often undercooked. Carefully seasoned with the right amount of tang lending from the balsamic reduction and some sweet hints from the fresh apple slices, the rehydrated dried cranberry fruits, the heap of rocket greens woke my taste buds with a striking saltiness from the accompanying shaven Parmesan. Just as the episode starts to climax, I felt a cold gush of water came splashing down - the 2 sesame rolls that served alongside was rockier & rubbery than the earlier baguette! What's happening to the breads here? I let out a heavy sigh!",

I'd really like to try their sandwiches the next time I'm there, the breads and pretzels looked quite enticing.Overall I'm excited at this new place.

In my opinion based on visiting Parisian bakeries & eating thru many of NYC's best croissants, I'd have to say that ABC's croissant is better than Maison K & Tiong Bahru B. ABC's croissant is crisp on the outside and has a sound when you tap the exterior, while the inside has visible layers with a soft interior. Today I tried the eclair which I thought was one of their signature items. It was a bit disappointing bc did not taste authentic at all. Tasted like something I'd buy from the supermarket and not up to ABC's high standards. I've also had lattes a few times and noticed that the temperature was bordering warm to lukewarm. C'mon ABC, I know you can do better! :)",

Subsequent visits to the Somerset and Asia Square outlets were really disappointing. I really wanted to like this place but the bread and pastries here are not worth the effort. On one visit I bought a loaf of bread after asking the staff to recommend one that was soft & fluffy in texture, instead it turned out to be dry and crumbly. On other visits, we have tried the pear tart, chocolate eclair (twice!), chocolate lava cake. The tart and lava cake were average, nothing to shout about. The eclair pastry was surprisingly dry and hard. I would rather pay a few more dollars to have a delicious Paul bakery eclair than waste my calories here. If you are looking for a chill out cafe to have a coffee and a chat with friends, this would be the ideal place.. But i wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again unless the quality of the food improves.",
