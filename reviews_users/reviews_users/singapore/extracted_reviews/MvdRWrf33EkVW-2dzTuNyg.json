Parking can be found at a nearby multi-storey parking garage or limited parking spots just behind the restaurant.Air-conditioned, tucked in a corner of the ground floor. This little big restaurant serves some of the freshest seafood and with chefs that know how to bring out the best of the seafood, you wouldn't be disappointed. Servers were also friendly and prompt.I've been here multiple times but have never reviewed it. So I feel now that I've come to taste most of the seafood on the menu, it's time to review it.Bamboo clam (razor clams) steamed with light soy sauce, spring onions, mung beans & fried minced garlic. Flavor was light but tasty. The clams were steamed to perfection, it was tender not rubbery.Crab Bee Hoon. Fried crabs & braised bee hoon sitting in thick savory sauce. The crabs were cracked to allow easy eating as well as letting the flavor permeate into the crab.Fried Soon Hock. Deep fried so crispy that the entire fish can be eaten like a cracker. The flesh of the fish was meaty, the head, tail and fins crispy allowing it to be eaten too.Coconut dessert, this dessert is served in a young coconut. Inside the coconut is coconut jelly, cleverly using the coconut water and gelatin. A scoop of vanilla ice-cream sits on it.",

    "text": "This is a classic Cantonese seafood restaurant in the Clementi district on Sunset Way. It's outdoor seating, but there's a private section that has A/C. It's popular for chili crab. Cool thing about this place is you get to choose your crab- that's pretty Asian. The pork spareribs are melt-in-your-mouth. There's no bone, but it still has that tender fall-off-the-bone texture. It's super savory and has a lightly sweet taste to it from the fat and marinate. Also, the spinach with salted egg soup is delicious. Yangzhou fried rice has a nice peppery taste. Chili crab is the obvious star though. Not as delicious as Malaysian chili crab (sorry, Singaporeans- I know about the argument between who has the best food- Malaysia or Singapore), but still deliciously spicy and hearty. The mantou (bread) is crispy and soaks up the chili for dipping. One more thing, for dessert, the coconut pudding dessert is amazing. The pudding is in a young coconut and it's sweet and doesn't have any artificial taste to it. It's one of the best Chinese desserts I've had! Clementi is a residential area, so there's not going to be many gwei-loh's or tourists. It's more local since it's not in the town, but the food here is super good.",

Not because of the quality of food but they couldn't handle the crowd and we had waited for 45 minutes for water to be served. Luckily it was our aunt and uncle and their family.Well, we decided to go back for fried rice with crab meat and shark cartilage soup. Unfortunately, both were not good. Shark cartilage soup was weak. The worst we have had. As for the fried rice, they might as well call it steamed rice.Disappointing to say the least. Will I go back again? Very unlikely.Giving it 3 stars only to be fair to them as we did not have their seafood. Otherwise, they really only deserve 1 Star for what we had on Sunday night.",

Their chili crab sauce was thick, creamy, and flavorful with a mild hint of spicy. The perfect amount of heat from the sauce didn't hinder the meaty crab's fresh taste, though make sure to get a plate of buns to scoop up all the leftover sauce. It's a messy dish to eat with your hands, but so delicious! Enjoy with fresh coconut water to help sooth the heat and overall richness of the chili crab dish.The bamboo clams with vermicelli noodles were great as well, and the savory broth was delicious with rice. The drunken prawns were large and succulent, though the taste of wine wasn't prominent. Overall the seafood here was delicious and very fresh, and you wouldn't expect any less since you pick out your meal from the live fish tanks.",

Chili was tomatoey with a tiny bit of spice for a nice balance that didn't overpower the natural flavor of the fresh crab. 5 stars.- Black pepper crab: didn't know this version existed and being a pepper fan loved it so much. Best thing was having a piece of this and the chili crab and blending the sauces together upon dipping a piece on the plate. 5 stars.- Shrimp: simple fresh full ones. 4.5 stars- Take out: we took out our meal and it was still good.Lowlights:- Can't get this at home and will be craving it until I can have it again.Second to my best friend living in this country, I'd return to Singapore for this crab.",

I drool thinking about it. \u00a0They have manage to perfect the salted egg yolk with puree pumpkin and possibly cream into something so addicting that I just couldn't get enough. \u00a0It's no wonder they ask you if you want mantau (plain buns) to go with it, our default answer was \"No\" thinking who needs more carbs when you have all this delicious seafood. \u00a0In hindsight, I was spooning up the sauce without the mantau realizing what a good idea it would have been.Ordered some razor clams. \u00a0Mine was cooked just perfectly although one member of our party claimed that theirs was chewy. The drunken shrimp was okay. \u00a0I was a bit upset that it wasn't drowning in alcohol. \u00a0The server placed the pot over the fire, once it came to a boil, he divided everything to be served. \u00a0To my dismay, the prawns itself lacked flavor. \u00a0The rice wine was worth a taste, but I've had better.They live fish is also a good choice if you want to get away from the other crustaceans and want something slightly healthy. \u00a0Unfortunately, I don't live in Singapore but this looks like a place to bookmark for my return trips just for that pumpkin sauce crab alone!",

Atmosphere is noisy and bustling. The seafood is fresh and this place separates itself from the competition through quality sauces.We dined on 1.9kg of Sri Lankan crabs two ways - salted egg and golden sauce (sweet butter & pumpkin) along with garlic prawns, broccoli w/ spicy XO sauce, and grilled beef and noodles for S$175. It seems a little silly to an American to put sauce on the outside of a crab, but that's how they roll in Singapore. Truly one of the messiest meals ever. I think they must deep fry the crab because the meat is not as moist as when steamed. As a result, it was tough to get at the leg meat.There were a few suckling pigs ordered around us and they looked delicious with really crisp skin.I had to chuckle when I noticed charges for wet naps, tap water, and seemingly complimentary peanuts. Still, the total damage was reasonable by Singapore standards.",

Or just dine during weekday lunches.Seafood is the order of the day, and you'll do well to get the Boston lobster and Alaskan king crabs. Skip everything else if tummy space is limited, as the cze char here is fair but not particularly memorable.We had:1) Sauteed Scallops with Asparagus in XO Sauce ($20 for small): decent albeit forgettable, a lovely contrast in soft and crunchy textures, and lively in spice.2) Spicy & Sour Szechuan Soup ($10 for small): surprisingly refined for a neighbourhood seafood joint such as this.3) Hongkong Steamed Giant Garoupa ($38) was unexpectedly done fillet-style, and it was a smidge overcooked. In any case, the fillets were still slightly bony. I suspect this would have been much better left whole.4) Alaskan King Crab in Pumpkin Cream Sauce ($138 per kg): absolute must-try and fantastic. The salted-egg yolk accent was a savoury, and decadent, counter to the sweetness of the pumpkin, and curry leaves and chilli specks lent a subtle heat to the velvety sauce. Seriously the best salted egg yolk sauce ever. We wiped this clean off.5) Alaskan King Chilli Crab: heady with spice, and complementary to the incredible sweetness of the crab. Once you've had Alaskan king crabs, you'll never want their Sri Lankan cousins anymore; I haven't been able to look at Sri Lankan crabs the same way since. A telling factor to how amazing these are: a girlfriend who's mildly allergic to crabs and has to take anti-histamines before indulging, didn't break out in hives even though she ate several crab legs.6) Boston Lobster Noodles: sweet with the essence of the shellfish. Excellent stuff.",

It's only a couple of minutes away from my place and my parents aren't good with corner coffeeshop zi char places, so this is our go-to place. And what a great go-to it is! The food is great, the prices are reasonable and the ambiance is nonetheless comfortable. My wife and I think the pumpkin & salted egg sauce they have, which we had for our crab, is one of the best dishes we've ever had, and by way of comparison, we just went to Le Bernardin in NYC. It's one of those genius combinations of sweet, salty, spicy, umami, and subtle flavors, such as from curry leaf, which distinguish the best of south-east asian food. Also good here are the razor clams and fillets of fresh fish, which you can order as an alternative to a big expensive whole fish, if you already have other dishes and a smaller party. I was not as big a fan of the drunken prawns, although my mother kept drinking the broth, so there was at least one fan there. I think if you let the shrimp marinate in the broth longer (the server insisted on ladling it out for each party member) and add the provided dipping sauce, it's still definitely delicious, just not necessarily a big star like the crab. Overall, I highly recommend this place. You can choose to sit either inside or outside, and if you are outside and have a problem with the mosquitoes, they will provide some mosquito coils.",
