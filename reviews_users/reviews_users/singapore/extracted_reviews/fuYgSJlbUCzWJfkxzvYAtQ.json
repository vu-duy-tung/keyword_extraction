    "text": "Impressed with this place! They have buffet lunch and a la carte dinner, and buffet dinner on holidays. Live music starts at 8 pm every night.The Papdi Chaat (indian taco) was sooo delicious and my favorite with flavours of mint, yogurt, and tamarind.We got the Tandoori Milawat that has a few pieces of 4 kinds of tandoori grills - chicken tikka, fish tikka, prawn, and kebab. It was great to try different kinds.The Aloo Gobi (cauliflower and potatoes) was kind of mushy and could've tasted better.The Chicken Makhanwala (butter chicken) was perfect with the naan bread.If you like bread, the bread basket was perfect! Plain and garlic naan, roomali roti (thin chappati-yum!), and tandoori parantha (also yum!)We tried the Jal Jeera to drink and it was very different and not something I would recommend. Can't go wrong with the Mango Lassi though.Unfortunately we were disappointed with the service. It could've been much better for the price we pay. Servers didn't clear our table or refill our waters. Most were chatting and standing around.We went for dinner this time but would love to try the lunch buffet next time.",

In my context I feel that this place is lush and posh.I had Chicken Makhanwala, Palak Paneer and Bengali Fish Curry with my Garlic and Butter naan. They are flavorful and delicious. I would prolly order 1 gravy dish in future. I had so much gravy that added complexity to the naan. LOL!As I was sitting at my table, I noticed a lot of hot plate being served out. And I was intrigued by the smell and flavour that I had to just ask the service crew what it was. Tandoori Paneer, the crew explained to me it's cottage cheese and peppers laced with a creamy marinade. The service was excellent n warming.",

Probably it is because she knows what to order.Music was too loud and 2 of us ended up having headaches. At one point the mike went berserk. I would rather they do without the Indian music and singing.",

    "text": "Our main course was the chicken tikki masala. Although a bit heavy on the onion, the tandoori chicken was tender and flavorful. The sauce was a scintillating collection of spices that excite the tongue. It worked well atop the sesame naan and vegetable stuffed naan. Note that each table also gets a crispy spiced wafer basket to start, which includes some tasty mint/pickle paste. The service was pretty good. There are several roaming staff members who fulfill different roles and work together to cover the tables. The ambiance in the dining room is most pleasant. It is quiet and decorated with an intricate gold/brown Indian theme. After 8pm, there was a small group playing live ambient music composed of subtle drumming, wind instruments, and light vocals. The flavors were great and the environment was soothing. While the prices are on the high side, this remains a good place for a wonderful Indian meal.",

The chicken masala is rich and textured, the vindaloo has a tang unlike any other I've tried, the makhani sauce is so rich and creamy it warrants a luxury tax of its own. For fine, yet classic Indian food, this to me is the top of the tree.",
