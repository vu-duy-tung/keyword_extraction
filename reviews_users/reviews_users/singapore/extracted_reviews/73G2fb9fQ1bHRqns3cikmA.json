    "text": "The best unagi I have ever eaten! I didn't know about this place until my friend recommended to me. You won't miss this place with its long queue outside the entrance. Everyone is orderly with a small number queuing right outside the door and an empty passage way for pedestrians to walk through then the longer queue starts so don't be deceived if you only see a few people at the door. My friend and I waited an hour which would have been longer if we were a bigger group. The place is pretty small which explains the long queue. We got a seat near the counter where they prepared the food. We were lucky to face the side of grilling the unagi instead of the side of slicing the unagi which was quite a bloody and unpleasant sight. You can also choose not to look up and just dig into your food. The unagi had really crispy skin and tender meat. To justify the waiting time to myself, I ordered the medium portion which was definitely filling and satisfying. We each paid about $30 which is value for money given the quality and portion of the food. Service was also polite and pretty attentive.",

    "text": "Oooooh-nagiAnd so, the 2017 Michelin Singapore Guide is out, with a bunch of new entries and new recommendations. One of them? Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant. I've heard the reviews, I've seen the \u00a0queues and I have to admit, my first reaction was, \"crazy, I won't queue for that\".How wrong I was. If not for my colleague suggesting Man man for a group dinner, I might have never gone to try it, despite my love for Unagi. #1 Tip. If you're going to be arriving anytime after 5.30pm, be prepared to wait. We got there at 5.20pm (our office is pretty nearby) and still ended up being the 6-7th group in the queue. The restaurant is small and cozy and really reminds you of Japan. What makes this restaurant different from other restaurants serving Unagi? The Unagi is freshly killed, skewered and grilled \u00a0in the restaurant. Medium Donburi ($25.80+)We decided to go with the basic, although the sight of everyone having the Hitsumabushi made us regret that decision a bit (oh well, gives me a reason to come back). After one bite, all I could say was......... life changing. What ever idea I had of what a good unagi should be and taste like went completely out the window. The sauce was flavourful without overpowering the natural sweetness of the eel and the eel.... oh my. It was tender, juicy, it melts in your mouth and tasted so.... pure (I can't even find the right words to describe it). Bottom line, I can see why it received its Bib Gourmand. Only draw back would be the queue but despite that, it still easily gets 5 stars from me.",

Thank God, I did because the Hitsumabushi set (eel three ways) is one of the most delicious meals I had in a long time. I had the large set: it was way too much food but I still finished all since it was so good.Aaaaaand, although the restaurant is super busy the service is awesome. All wait staff is mega friendly and attentive (yes for regular tea top-ups).So, delicious food and awesome service: 5 stars!! Worth the hype!",

    "text": "The restaurant was the latest by Chef Teppei. Interestingly the entrance to the place was at the back. Reached the place about 20 minutes before it opened and there was a queue of about 15 persons in front of me. The 6 counter seats were the first to fill up. \u00a0The place was quite smoky. One could even smell the smoky grilling smell before entering the place. The place was decorated in a light wooden look. By the way I did see a customer who bought a couple of fresh eels back too. Tables were placed quite near to each other. There was barely place for bags but lucky I selected a table by the shelf, therefore got place in the shelf for bag.On the table, there was condiments such as sweet sauce, unagi sauce, spicy, Japanese pepper and chilli powder to help yourself to. Refillable Iced tea was served.Kimoyaki (Liver) ($9.80+)Looked quite charred, It was chewy with smoky although it was a tab bitter at certain parts.Yahatamaki ($14.80+)Unagi roll stuffed with pickled radish in it. Crunchy and tangy.Large Kouhaku Histsumabushi ($39.90+)Unagi Served with Mentaiko Sauce, Soup, Pickles, Broth, Spices.The dish was a January special.To eat Histsumabushi, divide the serving into 4 parts.1) Have one serving in the small bowl which is also known as torizara, to enjoy the dish in its original tasteyakumi2) Second serving, add the yakumi (condiments such as fresh wasabi, chopped spring onions and green onions). I spend quite a lot of time busy grating the wasabi. The fresh wasabi really peaked up the dish.3) Third serving, add the lightly-flavored dashi (made from simmering fish or meat) broth. The dish reminded one of teochew porridge.4) Eat the Last Serving the way You Like best. As for me, I like it with the broth and freshly grated wasabi in it.The layer of Mentaiko Sauce was a tab too little to make a different to the dish.Although there was long queue, most customers finished their meals quite fast.",

    "text": "Man Man Unagi stands out in Singapore as a restaurant that is passionate about serving quality, authentic chargrilled unagi at accessible prices. The entrance is humbly tucked in a back alley that you might not notice if you weren't looking for it. As you walk in, you're greeted by nothing less than two pools of live unagi. I like a restaurant that knows what they stand for and isn't shy about it. Around 8:30pm on a Thursday, there wasn't too much of a line and we were seated almost immediately. Most of the tables are cozy, which is typical of a Japanese restaurant, so smaller groups are more ideal. Most come here to try unagi three ways, and that's exactly what I got, the Butamabushi for S$18.80+. The unagi was so fresh and perfectly basted. Basically the three ways are unagi with rice, unagi mixed with the side ingredients (seaweed, scallion, and wasabi), and lastly unagi with the ingredients and with a soup/dashi broth. You actually divide the serving into four parts, and the last part is eaten in your favorite way. My favorite was with seaweed and a hint of wasabi. The refillable ice green tea was also very welcome, and I'm glad they didn't pinch on small things like drinks. We also got a small side dish of unagi bone crackers for S$6, which probably wasn't necessary, but it was different and fun. Bravo for going all out on unagi by sourcing and preparing it like nobody else in Singapore.",

My partner had the kabayaki unagi set $26.8 and I had the shiraiyaki set with the same price. The unagi tasted really really fresh! My partner and I agreed that Man Man Unagi tasted better than the one in Japan with one michelin star. We also had mini unagi with vinegar as appetizer, really nice but a bit too salty and tamago which was really fluffy & delicious. I was also lucky because I didn't have to queue as I came during odd hour, otherwise be prepared to wait at least an hour. Location a little hidden, but the area outside the restaurant is very conducive for queuing, me thinks!",

First time I quit because the queue was ridiculously long... and I determined that I would succeed this time. The dinner starts at 6pm. We arrived at 5pm, and we were the second in the queue. Less than 10mins, another 10 more group arrived... and \u00a0by 5.30pm I couldn't see the tail of queue at all. Not exaggerating... it's really loooooooong queue! It is a small restaurant, and if you miss the first round, it will take another 1hr to come to your turn. They don't limit the time, means you can eat as slow as you want. The unagi is so delicious. It is so fresh as they slaughter the eels on the spot. It is so yummy that the price is no longer important. The staffs are very friendly and know very well the food they serve. I ordered Hitsumabushi, and I love it! I am not a porridge person but i am really falling in love with this one. My favorite is adding the unagi rice to the soup, and sprinkle the spring onion and seaweed. And I like to grate some fresh wasabi on top. The price range is $30 per person. Reasonable for this quality.",
