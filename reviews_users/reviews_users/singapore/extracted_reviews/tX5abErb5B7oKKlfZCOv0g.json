I went for the standard stack of pancakes with maple sirop and better. You get the option to choose a small, medium or large stack. Since I did not know the actual size of those pancakes, I just went for large. Oh boy, and it was definitely large. A bit too much. The taste was nice, but the last pancake was too much. So I asked them to pack it for me. Nicely packed in a box, with some maple sirop on the side, I got to take it home. And I warmed it up the next day. Nice. Overall only 3 stars, because it was just a pancake.",

I went to the staff to show them the piece of egg shell and complain. I was met with a sense of apathy and a mumbled apology. I told them that perhaps they should let the chef know. I was really disappointed with how the staff dealt with the issue.The staff made no attempt to recover the issue and just looked at me with a blank expression.I felt like I was the the strange person in the situation who had made a mistake rather than vice versa.I don't mind if the chef, staff, or management make a mistake but it is important that they try and deal with the issue and situation at hand. \u00a0The staff at strictly pancakes made no attempt to deal with the issue. That's why I am giving one star.",

But it was a bit too strong and too much for me. While I'll like to have a little bit of savoury to balance out the meal, but I also like ability to put some maple syrup on my pancakes. This garlic prawns totally dont gimme any room for syrup! :(in any case, it's still good and the next time Im back, i want space for my syrup!",

They are clearly understaffed, but what I don't get here is that they have an upstairs seating as well? Are they out to displease all of their customers by making them starve while waiting?Food was meh, pretty alright, the hamburger steak they made was pretty good (needed more salt), and they are pretty filling (well they are almost 100% carbs - what do you expect?).

    "text": "This quaint little 2-storey shop is found in the midst of a row of shop-houses along prinsep street such that you might almost miss out on it. The second level is most certainly the more desirable level to be on as the first level is often empty.The serving in this shop is definitely an overkill for just one person alone as one will get sick of the taste of pancakes after having it for awhile. I went there as a group of 4 and ordered 3 meals to share amongst the 4 of us, thus the portion was then, just right. The Garlic Buttered Prawns with Pancakes is personally my favourite and I highly recommend that you try this. The sauce that this pancakes are served with is almost too good to be true. However, the cherry tomatoes may just stink your mouth up so I suggest you don't eat them unless you've got mints on you.To counteract the savoury-ness from our first meal, we ordered the caramelized apples with pancakes and it was indeed a heartening choice. The caramelized apples were not overly-sweet and thank goodness for that. The scoop of ice cream that comes along with this meal is quick to melt thus I suggest that no one should hesitate in digging into this meal upon its arrival.Our last order was the \"Snuggle Up\" whereby 2 sausages were wrapped between 2 pancakes with toothpicks holding them together. This meal is considerably good, however it would seem to fall short if you've had the above 2 pancakes already.This place caters more to people who would just like to catch up with their friends instead of dates( unless you take the window seat and you go really early).In total, we spent $11 per person which is absolutely worth it!",

Ever heard of a pancake burger? Two thick pancakes that are suppose to substitute the typical burger bun with a beef patty slapped in the middle. Go to Strictly Pancakes and you can order this unusual dish. If you are like me and find it a bit odd to eat such a dish, go for their desserts... which are pancake based (Ok, it's quite a duh thing). I went for their triple chocolate pancake with a scoop of chocolate ice cream, strawberries, chocolate chips drizzled with chocolate fudge. A chocoholic like me can only clap my hands with glee when it was served. However, after going through one and a half pancake.. oh boy was I filled up. One thing I have learnt from this.. Strictly Pancakes may sound like a \"Meh... probably desserts only..\" place, but boy, I was in for a surprise with their interesting menu and their uber filling pancakes. If you ask me why I didn't rate this higher, it's because the location is pretty out of the way and the service was kind of terrible.. took us quite a while to order our meals and to get our food served.. and it wasn't peak period to boot!",

Discovered Strictly Pancakes one morning (when kaya toast just wasn't cutting it) searching the interwebs for a reasonable brunch dive where I could throw down on some flapjacks. We hopped over on the Circle line to Bras Basah MRT and walked our way up Princep where we found it--damn near hidden in a cute little complex of other restaurants and shops. The two-story shop was renovated about two years back and is really aesthetically sound. It's really cute in there--very stylish in a Singaporean avant garde kind of way. While it can get a crowded on the weekends, the wait in my experience hasn't been long. I ended up scratching my garlic monkey and went for the Potatoes Leeking Cheese, which is two pancakes stuffed with potatoes, cheese and leek, served with a side of sauteed mushrooms, garlic and herb butter and a \u00a0side of bacon to balance it off. For a drink I tried the Ice Blended Hazelnut Latte, which always seems to disappear as fast as it comes.I was actually surprised to see so many locals in here. Although most were younger, I would think that the Western palette would probably appreciate this place much more. Then again, theres no need in trying to make sense of Singapore. It's an anomaly in itself!The one thing keeping this place back would probably be the service. Cold and aloof (and this is coming from a pretty cold and aloof person) the staff sometimes seemed to not know what was going on or wasn't able to understand what their patrons wanted.Check out Strictly pancakes if you're craving a flavorful (good portioned) treat. Since my first visit, I've been a frequent visitor, telling any and everyone about \"funky pancake place!\" From savory to sweet (yay for options right?) you can't go wrong heading here for a brunch date.",

For the casual dinner who has the sudden craving for pancakes and are lazy to make their own, or if you're past McD's breakfast timings, then you're in luck. Not the most fluffy of pancakes, the pancakes on offer are pretty decent, and decently sized for the relative cheap price. You get a choice of salted or unsalted butter (go for the salted one, it makes a difference trust me) with maple syrup. You have the option of asking for another serving of butter and syrup at a slight cost, if you love your pancakes sweet! One thing to note, unless you're really crazy about chocolate pancakes, it might be wise to stay away from the Druggie as that is one seriously \"heavy\" pancake.
