The food here is good and there is a nice variety of dishes on their menu. I've had their Pad Thai, which is how I gauge most Thai restaurants, and it's nice and flavorful. I've been here a few times and I can't say I've ever been disappointed. It's a solid choice for lunch or dinner.",

Beef stripes instead nice chunkier beef. Beef was cooked oddly to must have been soften in some brine. The steamed rice was a small handful cup. And the sauce was so sweet and awful I drew most of the stuff away. Nothing made sense with this dish except the color.",

However, when we left at 12:15p, there was quite the line outside!I got the RED CURRY DUCK and it was not bad, but not great. The texture of the current was interesting; I think it felt a little powdery. The duck was a bit hard. I was hoping the duck would be nice and tender. The presentation was pleasant and the taste was pretty good. (I would eat the duck curt from OSHA Thai over this one any day).I'm quite disappointed that they didn't serve brown rice. The white rice was nothing special; just your typical white rice at the restaurant. The price is expensive for the quality of meal. $20 for curry and rice, but this is the CBD so that's expected I guess.",

This isn't even about authenticity, the food just simply tasted bland.On the most recent occasion, my dining party ordered four dishes: the red chicken curry, the minced chicken with basil, the fish cakes and some veggies.The basil dish is my favourite Thai dish (and I would normally eat it with minced pork but this was not available) and I have tried many versions over the years in many places. This is probably the worst version I have ever tried. It doesn't need much description: bland. It lacked spice, taste & anything interesting. Same goes for the red curry, it tasted watered down and lacked coconut milk or any interesting texture. The chicken was overcooked to the max.Basically, avoid this place. The Marina Bay area is not known for its food but you can still do better than this.",
