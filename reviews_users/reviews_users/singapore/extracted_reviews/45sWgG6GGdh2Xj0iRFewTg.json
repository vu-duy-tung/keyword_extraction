Also the menu shows a serving size of 3 prawns but they actually charge $15 or $5 per prawn. Also the $5 prawns were pre-cooked and warmed since they insides were tough and without any flavor or spices. Be carful out tab for 2 was $76 S.

    "text": "Inspired by Andrew Zimmern 's \"Bizarre Foods\" episode where he visited Banana Lead Apollo (BLA) and had the so-called \"famous Fish Head Curry\" and raved about how flavorful it was, I found myself nearby at the Temple and opted to trek a few blocks further into Little India to this establishment to whet my appetite. \u00a0Although it is on 48 Serangoon Rd, the entrance is on an adjacent st. (on Hastings Rd) about a block from the Little India MRT station. \u00a0If you walked passed Campbell Lane, you've gone too far. \u00a0Yesterday, while I was there, it was intensely crowed because of a parade that appeared to be going along Serangoon as part of the Pongal Festival (a Harvest Festival).Oddly, upon entering BLA, \u00a0I noticed that it was only around 25% occupied, if that, on a crowded Friday night. \u00a0The interior is cold lit with what appears to be around 4-5 kitchens where there are staff preparing dishes at their respective stations and you'll often find them unsettlingly staring deeply at you while you're eating.Perusing the menu, I saw the Fish Head Curry selling for around $S22-28 depending on the size you wanted to order. \u00a0If you order this, I suggest you get the small to share with another person. \u00a0I ordered the medium and it was ridiculously too large. \u00a0In addition, we ordered the chicken Briyani (an Indian equivalent to chicken rice), some garlic naan, stewed curry vegetables. \u00a0 With the dishes comes a complimentary serving of these circular chips that tastes like dried pig skins or shrimp chips. \u00a0I tried one and it was awe-ite. \u00a0The lingering housefly noticed I wasn't too keen on it and obnoxiously laid claim to it.Note that the green mat is actually a banana leaf that you can place your food on. \u00a0That is to say: the mat=plate. The chicken Briyani was pretty good and came with two sauces: 1) a curry based sauce; and 2) an interesting tangy yogurt with chopped cucumber (favorite sauce here) \u00a0While the rice was aromatic, the chicken lacked flavor and wasn't very appealing. \u00a0And now to the Main Event: the Fish Head Curry. \u00a0The server placed this huge bowl and a gigantic fish head in a red, curry based sauce. \u00a0This \"secret sauce\" pretty much tasted like any other curry based sauce in any dish in any Indian Restaurant. \u00a0While it made an excellent dipping sauce for the naan, would you pay $S26 for a naan dipping sauce?If anything, I was perplexed at how much meat there is in a fish head. \u00a0The fish head meat is soft (especially the cheek meat) and has a stewed consistency. \u00a0Honestly, it is more hype than anything. \u00a0Yes there is some quality, but it didn't \"wow\" me at all, especially given the price.The curry stewed vegetable dish was blegh. \u00a0Didn't do much to my palette and this is coming from a person who walked into this establishment very hungry.All in all the fish head curry is a dish where you're guaranteed to get your hands dirty as it's a messy dish. \u00a0That means unfortunately, you will have to wash your hands in the filthy bathroom located at the back. \u00a0Word of warning, do not use the washroom prior to eating. \u00a0If you do so, you will lose your appetite.The service is pretty reliable. \u00a0Though at times, they rush and do not listen carefully as the staff person gave us something we were only considering to order (a mango lassi which was actually not bad) but didn't commit to.All in all, the experience is a unique one, but I doubt that I'd ever need to stop by here again. \u00a0Thumbs up slightly on the quality and service. \u00a0Thumbs down on the atmosphere (especially the third world quality wash rooms).For these dishes and a Tiger beer, it will cost you around $S65.",

The butter chicken was tasty, but the naan breads (butter as well as garlic) were a little dry. The place was pretty much empty on a Friday evening which was slightly strange, and the service was slow despite this fact. My eating companion and I were in a pinch so we chose this place more based off of proximity than reviews. Not horrible, but would not recommend if you have time and want to find some lip-smacking Indian food in this part of town.The prices are also slightly less than palatable given the service and quality of food.",

I felt a bit like a rebel ordering both South and North Indian and eating it all on the same Banana Leaf but that is part of the fun of this place. Very good veg food. I dream of Banana Leaf..",

    "text": "This is a review of a dinner with a colleague at Banana Leaf Apolo.The room is very basic and functional. It is a clean space though. \u00a0It was not very busy (a Wednesday evening) when we were there.The service is friendly and polite but basic. \u00a0Your order is taken and your food is brought out. \u00a0The food came out in a timely procession. \u00a0It was neither delayed nor rushed.As you probably already know, the food is eaten from a banana leaf instead of a plate. \u00a0Possibly because we are westerners, we were provided with forks and spoons. \u00a0 So, we didn't really do the eat with our fingers things.The food was all pretty good. Some of it was even great. \u00a0It was all freshly prepared. \u00a0While nothing fancy, the \u00a0food was presented in a pleasing manner.Vegetable Samosa - Personally, I prefer the larger style samosas with more filling. \u00a0But these were good. \u00a0They were crispy on the outside and tender and flavourful on the inside. \u00a0They went well with the provided sauce.tinyurl.com/crp68poVegetable Pakora - These were \u00a0tasty. \u00a0But they were not as piping hot and crisp as I like them to be. \u00a0I did enjoy them though.tinyurl.com/cysvgkjButter Chicken - This was a sweet and buttery dish. \u00a0It was pretty much exactly what I expect from Butter Chicken. \u00a0They were generous with the chicken and it was very tender.No PhotoSpicy Prawn Masala - This was a very nice dish. \u00a0It was not very spicy though. \u00a0As with the chicken, the prawns were tender. \u00a0For my tastes, the prawns were perfectly prepared.tinyurl.com/cge9zxqAloo Gobi - This is not something you will hear from me very often. \u00a0My favourite dish was the Aloo Gobi. \u00a0Yep, the vegetarian dish won the evening. There was just so much flavour and it all worked so well together. \u00a0The cauliflower and potatoes were both cooked just right. \u00a0So good!tinyurl.com/bojsrtlRice and Garlic Naan - Both of these were well prepared. \u00a0I could have personally handled a bit more garlic on the naan. \u00a0But, all things considered, it was a good take on one of my favourite breads.Overall - This is a basic shop that serves better than basic Indian food. I would love to try some of their other dishes. \u00a0They offer both southern and northern Indian cuisine. \u00a0We really enjoyed the food.",

    "text": "A happy meal here is an order of fish head curry, and all the refills of rice and vegetables you could want, served by men walking around with silver buckets of food. NOM. I've never quite understood why a curry fish head restaurant had to also serve other things like tandoori chicken, but not everyone likes their food looking back at them. I remember Apolo as the one with the chandeliers (yes, really), and it's really a sign of how much fish head curry is part of our national identity that busloads of tourists come by ever so often for it.",
