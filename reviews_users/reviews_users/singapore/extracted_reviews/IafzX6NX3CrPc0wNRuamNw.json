    "text": "Always a fantastic place to have authentic South Indian food. The service is fast and the owner ensures that all the patrons have a great experience. Their banana lassi is fantastic as is their filter coffee. In many ways, I find the food in this restaurant to be a bit better than Komala Vilas. Their VIP thali is fantastic and you have the choice of either poori, bhatura, chappati or parotta. They also make sure that they refill all the curries in time. I only wish that they take credit cards. Other than this, this one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore.",

    "text": "Met my ex-school mates at this Indian Dosa restaurant in little India section of Singapore. It was good to see them there and it was a good time to catch up on life. I ordered the marsala dosa paper thin version. It came in a steel plate with three compartments. The dosa and potato filling was good and so were the dipping veggie curry and sauces. I enjoyed very much and service was pretty efficient but not super attentive. Try the bru coffee (pronounced brew) which is supposed to be a coffee from India. It was delicious and strong. Fortunately the restaurant has a/c so it will be great for tourists. I will come back again should the opportunity arise.",

    "text": "Recently my mom was eating in the restaurant for lunch at 2:45 pm. The staff came over and turned off the lights while she was eating, in a rude manner. The staff seemed to be directed to do this by the staff manager. So she was very interested to know why they had turned off the lights and asked why he did as such. He simply told her to move over to another few seats which were near the entrance without offering an explanation. We find this extremely annoying and quite uncalled for as it was simply inappropriate to eat in the dark. In case you wish to explain to us why this happened, do feel free to drop me an email personally at parvin.net@gmail.com. In fact I expect it quite soon.",

You'll have one and you know you'll want one more. They have lovely appams as well served with milk and this nice sweet orange sugar. The mock biryani here is huge and is really yummy. It's very reasonably priced and the service is decent.",
