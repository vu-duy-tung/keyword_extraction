    "text": "Came here twice. Once on a weekday, the other a weekend. There was an April only promotion - 50% off for 4 pax.My first visit, weekday lunch starts at 11am. So there were 3 of us and the promotion would not apply to us unless we bought a 4th pax and we would enjoy the 50%. The usual price was $48++ per person. And so we did as recommended by the manager.Peach Garden is located in the Amara Hotel in the Havelock area.. Parking here can be pricey if you come on a weekday. We parked some distance away off Chin Swee Road, in the residential area and took a short walk to the hotel.Once we sat down, we were promptly attended to. We ordered our tea and took a look at the menu. The promotion menu is on a piece of print out where one would be required to mark what we wanted.Our first dish was the deep fried Soon Hock (Grouper). The dish was excellent. Every part of the fish was edible, even the tail because it was so crispySoup: we ordered a mix of clear sharks fin broth & thicker version. Both were tastyAbalone & wasabi. This turned out a little disappointing. The salad was rather bland. There wasn't a key item for the eyes to feast on therefore killed the dish for me.Fried shrimp. Slightly oily but tasted great. Would've preferred lighter/less batterSpinach, tri-egg in broth. This dish is a must have.On my second visit being a weekend, there were 2-round seating, one being 11am, the other being 1pm. Therefore be aware you cannot sit leisurely for lunch.The menu had fewer soup items, and a few additional items. This time, the manager told me that the Soon Hock is not available. This was a huge disappointment because this time, we brought our grandmother who loves fish. And we had to order other fish dish.This time, everything was salty. The saltiest item we ordered was the spinach noodle in Mapo Tofu sauce. We returned it. What we ordered that we did not the other day were Indonesian curry shrimp. The shrimps were fresh. Flesh was tender. Curry base was tasty. Would've loved it better if some yew tiao were provided to soak up the sauce.Steamed PaTing fish, slightly fishy, but still quite good. sauce it was sitting in was good with rice.Herbal shrimp. This was so good, we each drank up all the herbal soup that the shrimps were sitting in.Deep fried fish skin. It was good but was a little soft by the time the skins were served.I would definitely come back again but will only do it when there's a promotion. Otherwise, it's just too expensive.",

    "text": "Peach Garden 30% off Dim Sum.The dim sum menu items on the menu has only 17 varieties. Most of the normal dim sum was on it. The most expensive item is the shark fin dumpling with abalone being S$20 per bowl. The rest of the items starts from S$5.80 onwards.Entrance from the car park goes directly into the dinning area. You have to make your way to the front to meet the maitre'd. Service after that was fast. The waitress asked which tea would we like but actually she only had one type, so why bother to asking? Chances of someone ordering the tea she carries is like 1 in 70 due to the number of tea combo there are. There were numerous occasions that the waitress brought us the wrong order, sure the restaurant was crowded but not full.We ordered the normal stuff, prawn dumplings, meat dumplings, chicken legs, steam pork rib, various buns, century egg and pork porridge, fried carrot cake and the $20 shark fin dumpling. Unfortunately the shark fin dumpling was not that good and does not worth the $20. The pork ribs was lean and so after steaming, it was really tough. The various prawn and meat dumplings was average. The char siew pow was above average and was the only item worth ordering. The century egg and lean pork porridge was rather expensive as it was like 7 spoons of porridge only. The carrot cake was also nice but it was $18 and comes with prawns.Overall the food is just average and it was rather expensive But hey this is a after all an hotel restaurant.",

    "text": "This will be a more of a photo diary because I don't even know half the things being ordered and I just eat!Had the AYCE menu where you'll just submit on a piece of paper what you'd like to eat so we kind of went overboard~This tea on the right side is Longan Tea which was really bitter here... & had to ask \u00a0for more hot water to water it down ):Shiu yok - So under-rated but tasted so good for some odd reason. Shrimp soup - supposed to be good but it was plain and nothing special. Crunchy fish fins or something like that - which actually didn't taste so bad because it kind of melts in your mouth.Wasabi shrimp dish - Even though I hated wasabi, I still tried it... and nope, it wasn't for me.2 Big pork dishes - The pork on the left tasted really good. It almost tastes like pork shoulder (I could be wrong) and the sauce tasted sweet and savoury.Peking duck!!!!! - Always awesome, not on the menu, ordered separately I believeShark fin that they served - it was under this section of the menu where there were 4 options and each person can choose one. I chose the shark fin. Even though it probably is made out of chicken broth, etc... I still enjoyed it.This was the other option - abalone soup. Yes, that is the abalone which looks so small like a clam. It was totally not worth it.Tom yum prawn soup - Actually so spicy. So so spicy but fills up my soul.Lots of dessert options as well! - Little colourful jellies, hahaha. This dessert is sweet and simple - suits my tastes exactly.Table overall was just so full all the time with tons of food. Was yummy... but like I said, we over ordered. Oops.Peach Garden is a nice huge restaurant with huge tables (seemingly only for special occasions or big groups) and high ceilings. The manager who tended to us was nice but the server was kind of awful. When we asked for items, she didn't get back to us or she forgot about it... & She has this snobbish attitude while serving us.PS: The restaurant may look fancy, but don't expect the washroom to be just as fancy.",

She then went on saying that if we made the booking over the phone, the person would have told us about our timing to eat - which we weren't given at all?? after that she went and came back and said ok, we could eat and our last order was till 915pm. Really strange service, and food took awhile to come. Food was meh. We paid total for 6 pax, per person at around $30++ after the 'promotion'. I think we could have had better quality food at a regular zi char store with much tastier food. The worst we had was the 'char siew with bones'. Seriously? Nope. Never again.",
