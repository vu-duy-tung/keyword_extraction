    "text": "Serious contender for the number 1 spot for Nasi Lemak. Every single dish is awesome. Chicken wings are mega awesome, simple, clean fried deep but doesn't feel yucky oily. This is one of the few places you feel clean after eating. I would say this is the elevated, a little more premium kind of nasi lemak. Its even suitable for a weekend family dinner if you get what I mean. Again, 5 stars for the good food, clean environment, and just a wonderful place to eat Nasi Lemak at. Detailed review:Rice - fluffy and grainy. Not soggy and meshed up at all. Very good. Cross cut cucumbers - thank you for the love. Chilli - above average but does not mix too well with the rice at times.Chicken wings - awesome! Dry and very crunchy on the outside. Juicy and succulent on the inside. Just how I like it. Sides - all good and what it should be. (Nghoh hiong and heh Joh is a little disappointing though.) Lon Tong is a absolute delight especially when mixed in with the chili. Queue - 10-15 mins. Saturday night still able to get seats.There's a sink for you to wash your hands after eating those wings. Must be the cleanest coffee shop in Singapore and sets an example! This has to be mentioned!",

    "text": "This spot is unassuming as they come. It's cafeteria style food, right...and then you take a bite of the coconut milk-infused rice...and then it's basically game over from there. You dab at the chili sauce, to find that the flavors mingle perfectly with the rice- so you mix the rest of your chili into the rest of your mound of rice. Then you bite into the crispy fried chicken. What a texture contrast to complement the creamy heat you've just concocted before. Juicy and crispy- matched with creamy heat- wow. Two crispy fried tofu rolls stuffed with water chestnuts and a bit of ground pork and wood ear mushrooms completes this wallop of a meal to my taste buds. I finish off the meal with a cold barley drink- not very sweet, just enough to help cool of the residual heat from the chili. I'm down for the count. \u00a0And fat. And happy. \u00a0Oh, and this was my second meal after an already solid meal across the street at Heng Long. Simplicity and excellence in food can be so beautifully tasty....",

    "text": "My 1000th review is dedicated to my favourite nasi lemak place in Singapore!The perfect combo for me is: rice, fried chicken wing, luncheon meat (Spam), fried egg, ikan bilis, string bean, eggplant, and yes to chilli. Total damage is $7.30 + more fat for my muffin top. I regret nothing every time.If it's your first time, definitely choose the fried chicken as it never disappoints. Always juicy, with the crispiest skin that is the most beautiful shade of golden brown I've ever seen.Don't let the queue deter you. Also, pay attention once you are the 4th or 5th person in the queue, as that's when they begin taking your order- and they are rapid fire quick.Add in a lime juice from the nearby drink stall to complete the meal. You're welcome.",

    "text": "I can seriously imagine Daym Drops coming to Ponggol Nasi Lemak, ordering some of that seriously fine Fried Chicken for \"take away\" and heading back to his car where he does of one of his well-known YouTube videos showing off his initial reaction after the first bite! Yep, my reaction was the same reaction he had when he took that very first bite out of a Five Guys Burger. The fried chicken at this Nasi Lemak is literally just to die for (cholesterol anyone?). The skin is crispy, and the meat has that great oily finish. The coconut rice is super fragrant and the side offerings are top-notch. In terms of the side offerings, go for the green beans and egg. Aside from the Chicken, my favorite is the serving of Sambal that the auntie puts on once the dish is served. I'm not sure, if the Sambal here is specially made or comes from the regular supermarket, but I find it very tasty, but not overly powering spicy like other sambals I've tried. The mix of fried chicken, coconut rice and a tinge of Sambal is just heavenly.Lines are long, a lot longer than I'd like, but as any Singaporean / local would know: a stall with a long line, is usually a stall that is very good. Punggol Nasi Lemak is no exception to the rule!",

    "text": "Finally! I had the foresight to arrive 15 minutes before opening (5:15) and man was that a smart move. 5:30 and the queue was already wrapped around the corner. I went with another yelpers recommendation and got the luncheon meat and the chicken thigh. I also added lady fingers and French beans to counterbalance the fry fest. Everything was so good. The chicken was \u00a0cooked perfectly so that with every bite you could hear this delicious crunch. I might have to double up next time. The sambal was a little tame but kicked up the flavor level with a mild spice and slight sweetness that mixed pleasantly with the coconut rice. I can't wait to go back and try everything they have to offer. Yummmm",

    "text": "There is always long queue everytime I visit this place, large variety of food but price might be on the high side despite its nice display. Ordered some ikan bilis , otah , fish fillet and chicken to go along with the rice , price has risen a lot from a mere 6$ to 8$-9$. I think the price has increased tremendously from the past and food quality has really dropped. Apart from that i would not want to queue for such a long time for that kind of quality and price. The green rice was average (used to be better), not really the grainy type that i like to eat. Chicken wings was pretty normal as well, nothing fantastic about it.The queue can sometimes reach the main road and that is madness. Overall i would not waste time queuing for expensive and low quality food. Maybe if they improved on their food quality will i go back to patronize them again.",

I'm not sure if one serving is enough to fill you up if you're rather hungry. Nevertheless, its good food!",

On top of them serving excellent nasi lemak in the traditional sense, they also offer a range of other dishes that you can choose from (very much like a mixed rice store in a way where you pick the dishes that you want to accompany the fragrant coconut rice) - from deep fried chicken wings to fish cake, fish, squid, eggplant, eggs, and a wide variety of other vegetables. \u00a0With the wide variety of dishes, it'll be hard pressed to find someone who isn't able to have an enjoyable meal here. The portions are however tiny,and their nasi lemak is pretty pricey! Very clean for a road side / hawker store though, even the toilets are kept clean - I was pretty impressed.",

The rice, for starters, isn't as fragrant, and sometimes is a bit greasy. The rice portion also seems smaller.The chicken wing here is still good, and so are the other vegetable or rice dishes. But I feel less satisfied with the overall experience as it just doesn't seem like good value to pay so much for a meal that isn't that filling.Parking around here is a right pain in the proverbial... I'd come here later at night rather than around dinner time. The traffic here also does get pretty congested during the peak hours in the evening. I've witnessed accidents on this stretch 3 times already, no kidding.The place is clean and brightly lit, but I do prefer the food from the original stall. Can't really put my finger on what's wrong exactly, but the everything just feels that little bit off kilter.",

Add in a fried chicken wing, some long beans, a fried sunny side up egg and some ikan bilis and you have the perfect meal for you. ]However, parking is a nightmare around the area since it draws a huge crowd all the time.

The queues are ridiculously long, so much so that there are lines to mark out the direction for queueing. Parking is terrible, as the Tanjong Katong stretch is jam packed with eateries. I do find this place incredibly expensive though; a takeaway box can cost up to as much as $6 depending on the sort of ingredients one chooses. Yes, the rice is fragrant, chili has enough kick, chicken wing crispy but still, is a bit too steep for frequent stopovers. Heck, the place isn't even air-conditioned!",

It's pretty common to see a long queue forming up during the evening and especially later at night, when most of us head out for supper. This branch located in the east, has a fairly decent amount of seating though parking can be a hassle as most of the time, you'll find cars either parked there or the nearby carparks full, which means a longer waiting time. What I usually do is to go there, queue up, order take away and proceed to somewhere else to indulge myself with the deliciously fragrant nasi lemak.",
