    "text": "I've updated my rating to 5-stars; maybe it was just that I was incredibly hungry, but my blue cheese (the usual) burger was especially delicious on my latest visit. Good serving size, succulent meat, amazing sauce, fresh toppings - truly sensational.I've also tried the Elvis burger - bananas, peanut butter, bacon, and patty. It's a messy sucker but it's quite tasty. Definitely not something I'll get regularly (the bleu royal takes that accolade) but worth experimenting with for a surprise! The chilli cheese fries are also fairly good; enough for three on the side and generous toppings. The vanilla shakes are glorious, while the chocolate comes in a far second.",

I'm also not really a burger person, I went here with some friends so I doubt I would have gone out of my own volition. I was impressed by the amount of choices they had so you could craft your own perfect burger though.",

    "text": "Set in the heart of Holland Village, Fat Boys features a very good selection of pre-set burgers with the ability to build your own with a variety of buns, meats and toppings. I tried the Fat Basterd which is 2 patties with cheddar, BBQ sauce and a fried egg on a sesame seed bun. The burger was well prepared, cooked medium with lots of flavor. Make sure to ask for extra napkins as it gets quite messy. If you are a singapore eating-pro you will probably have your own, but it never hurts to ask for more.All burgers seem to come with fries, so there isn't a need to order extras unless you are really hungry.Drinks include milkshakes, sodas and beers. Stella Artois seems to be the favored beer and they have after 10pm happy hour with price reductions.Like most places in Singapore service isn't amazing, but it's good enough. Overall, there isn't much better than sitting on a nice patio eating a good burger with a cold beer.",

    "text": "Love this cosy cafe that packs a punch with an awesome list of burgers! You can even build your own burger if you know what patty works with what toppings and sauces. From the traditional to the wacky, you will never get sick of the burgers here.My favourite is still The Elvis - a dessert kind of burger with the banana, peanut butter and a pork patty with bacon in between a honey oat bun. It's magic in my mouth! I'm a dessert baby afterall!Burgers aside, the side dishes - especially the spicy drumlets are mouthwatering and portioned for about 3 to 4 people if you are also having burgers. Calamari rings in a beer batter is great too - you can taste the beer.Desserts may not sound impressive here but to get your sweet fix, order their malt milkshake that you can add more stuff like nutella, marshmellows etc! Thick, silky and creamy, it's a good way to start or end the burger meal!A place to just kickback, watch the sports channel (they have a tv in the cafe) and enjoy the awesome food they have there. A great place to enjoy the all time comfort meal - burgers!",

I don't disagree with them, the burger are as juicy as it gets. The concept is too build your own burger, the true 'Have it your way\" burger:CHOICE OF BUN: Sesame Seed Bun,Whole Meal Bun,Honey Oat BunCHOICE OF PATTY: Beef, Lamb, Pork, Grill Chicken, SalmonADD ONS: Bacon, Chili Queso, Guacamole, Portobello Mushroom, Sauteed Shitake Mushrooms, Sundried Tomatoes, Cheddar Cheese, Swiss Cheese, Monterey Jack, Cheese, Wild Arugula, Fried Egg, Beetroot, Caramelized Onions, Onion Marmalade, Grilled Bananas, Grilled Pineapple, Pickles, JalepenoSAUCES: Fatboy's Homemade BBQ, Wasabi Mayonnaise, Honey Mustard, Caesar Dressing, Roasted Garlic Aioli, Peanut Butter, Curry Remoulade, Bleu Cheese DressingSmoked Chipotle, Mango Chutney, NutellaI always go for the Honey Oat, Salmon, fried egg, nutella burger, yummy! Ok maybe not, but i have been curious how to combine nutella on a burger but still haven't find a way to make it work.The lamb is juicy and has a lasting deep flavour and forms a perfect combination with the caramelized onions. This burger won't leave you hungry. Do take into account some waiting time though as the burgers take a while to be prepared, usually i'm at my second milkshake already when the food is served.",

The classic 'Royale with cheese' beef burger is also good. Haven't ordered a custom burger so far, but there is a good selection of meat, sauce, bun and toppings \u00a0to choose from. Fries are decent too.Their weekday lunch combos for $10 are great value, and also include non-burger selections like grilled dory, pasta marinara and chicken chops.",
