Chewie, mild chicken taste. I suppose when comparing among the nugget world, McDonald's is better. Although it's definitely still well prepared.- Cleanliness is top notch, but it is also Singapore - everything is clean.",

    "text": "The cheesesteak here is mediocre. The beef tasted like it'd just been cooked and there was neither the flair of the grill nor any fragrance - it tasted like it'd just been boiled and then put inside the bun. Although it was oozing cheese there was almost no onion inside.The chicken coney hot dog was a bit better. There was quite a lot of coney sauce but it was made of chicken so it didn't taste exactly right. It was better than A&W Indonesia's pathetic and limp chicken coney sauce though. The sausage was okay - better than normal chicken sausages in Singapore (what is called \"hot dog\", is filled with questionable material and is really soft). In fact it was similar to the Ikea hot dog sausage. Strangely it was cut in two and fully wrapped with paper which made it very messy when opened.The first batch of fries were good - well fried, with bite and with enough cheese on top. Unfortunately the \u00a0second batch were slightly underdone - some fries were slightly undercooked and/or not crispy enough.The mushroom soup was mediocre. It was a bit watery and tasted like there was mushroom oil or essence inside. It didn't taste generic - which was good - but it wasn't quite hot enough.The coleslaw was weird, tasting raw and underdressed. Also, strangely, it was marked as a dessert.",

    "text": "Toa Payoh has a nice selection of local food, but for Western fare, not so much. \u00a0Therefore, I was very surprised and excited to see a cheese steak place near the office. \u00a0Having lived in Philly for \u00a03 years, I had some high expectations coming here, so perhaps this explains the 3 stars. \u00a0For starters, I would say the bread was actually the closest to D'ambrosio's that I have had in SG so far. \u00a0Soft but not too soft and the perfect size for a sandwich. \u00a0But if I look at the cheese (way too much) and onions (way too little), the balance was not there. \u00a0For about $3 more, you can get a set which includes a drink and cheese fries, which were quite good. \u00a0But at the end of the meal, I felt like I had way too much processed cheese :). \u00a0Overall, Yellow Submarine falls short on the executtion a bit, but the results are still pretty tasty and the value is there.",

    "text": "I grew up in the US, nearby Philadelphia - the original hometown of the Philly Cheesesteak, which made the \"hoagie\" famous. And I've had my share of Philly Cheesesteaks - from good to amazing.The average cheesesteak in the US is nothing fancy - some meat, cheese, and maybe grilled onions/mushrooms. And the best ones are HUGE and CHEESY. Americans love cheese on everything.That said, Yellow Submarine's cheesesteak hoagie tasted pretty decent! The bread was toasted just right, the meat roasted well and shaved thinly like it's supposed to be. The cheese was melty, gooey, dripping, there was lots of it - just the way we Americans like it! The cheese fries tasted pretty good too! Felt like a pretty \"authentic\" cheesesteak actually. Although the taste was on-point, I didn't feel like I was getting the \"bang for my buck\" - not getting my money's worth - hence the four stars.I spent $9.90 on their classic cheesesteak plus fries, small drink. Since I don't eat so much, so the portion was just right.But I feel like I could have had more food for paying that much - I'd be much more satisfied if the meal was about $1.50-2.00 cheaper.Overall, taste is OK! If I ever have a huge hankering for cheesesteak hoagies, I might drop by occasionally - but only because I live next door!",

    "text": "I'm a carnivore and nothing makes me happier than a combination of thin juicy slices of premium beef with gravy, topped with melted American cheese and sauteed onions sandwiched in a bread roll. \u00a0The latest option to satisfy this Philly Cheesesteak craving in Singapore is the Yellow Submarines, a cheery and happy spot located in the Toa Payoh heartland. The Yellow Submarine Classic (S$6.90) is a tasty sub no doubt with high quality Australian sirloin steak being used in this one. The cheese sauce also had me swooning and i wished there was more of that in my sub (i gave feedback that they should provide a side portion of cheese sauce for all who wants more heh). The bun was also faultless with its crusty exterior and toasted \u00a0buttery interior. \u00a0Here comes the but.. and only because i'm too accustomed to the real deal. The meat was a little too thickly sliced and hence it lacked in the juice department. The large onion chunks (a fixture in all their subs) were too Asian styled for my liking. Philly cheesesteaks have long strands of sauteed, caramelized onions, not chunky pieces. And why the ketchup? Now that definitely doesn't belong in a Philly cheesesteak. Thankfully the ketchup taste wasn't too overpowering. I'm not saying it is no good, it's just not authentic Americano. I cannot express how crazy i am about Yellow Submarines' cheese sauce. Made from a blend of several cheeses, this heavily guarded secret recipe is a sure winner. You gotta make your sub a meal with the Torpedo fries and a drink for an additional $3. I say this is certainly one of the best tasting cheese fries in Singapore. Desserts don't fare as well here ($2.80 each). Again, everything was toned down for the Asian palate. Food should educate, not accommodate and this whole 'catered to Asian taste' thingy is sure pissing me off (i'm . The cheesecake was very milky and soft, though lacking in the richness of the cheese. The brownie was dry and not chocolatey enough.Overall, i did enjoy my meal at the Yellow Submarines. The fries are sufficient for me to visit again soon. Do hope some changes will be made to un-Asian-fy the subs. More cheese would definitely be awesome.",

The beef cheese steak was not too bad, though it didn't come with the oozy cheese a philly would have. I'd be giving the classic yellow submarine a try instead the next time. Cute dining concept, happy to see they have an outlet in Bugis too.",
