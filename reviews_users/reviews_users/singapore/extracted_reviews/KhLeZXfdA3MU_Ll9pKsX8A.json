High ceilings with fans. Good enough as it isn't too hot this Sunday afternoon.It serves Hainanese western and local food. \u00a0It is what I call comfort food. Not expensive but I wouldn't say it's cheap. Main courses from $6.50 to $26.00.Food is all right. I wouldn't come all the way here just for the food, more for the ambience.Food 3 stars; authentic ambience 4 stars.Opens 11.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. Closed on Mondays.",

    "text": "Hearing so much about Colbar for a long time, I have finally been here to Whitchurch Road. I must admit it is not an easy task to travel all the way into Wessex Village square as it is quite remote from the public transport system and even if one is driving, we have to go through some narrow roads.One thing that I is worth the travel is the nostalgic feel that really gave us the feel that we were back into the past. Walking deeper into the pavement, I felt that as though there was a tweak in the time machine, bringing us into 60s, 70s and all we saw was some foldable wooden shop doors with the rustic looking signboard. Not only that, as we entered into the cafe, we were welcome by this old school analog weighing scale.Over at the counter, you will notice a road sign with \"Jalan Hang Jebat\". That was actually its original location before moving to witchurch road.Even the menu looked so old school.Forget about air conditioned dining as Colbar offers dining just like time had stopped back in the 70s where such cool environments are still not so common.With the drinks accompanying the meal, I find that the amount was relatively on the high side given the pricing.Lime Juice - $4 & Strawberry Milkshake - $5.50 They serve good breakfast items. Even though we were having dinner, we decided to order sides like Tomato Omette for sharing. Egg was fluffy with slices of tomato.Pork Cutlet was lean and easy on the jaws with mushroom gravy that was on a salty side. However, such style of preparation are lesser seen in the Western Food Serving nowadays and I totally enjoy having this \"home-style\" cuisine.Pork Chop, Chips & Mushroom - $11Food tasted nothing extra ordinary but such food combination was nothing like what we had outside. Besides the chips, the chicken cutlet comes with a sunny side egg and Goreng Pisang (Fried Banana) which we thought was rather unusual.Chicken Maryland - $16.50Having dine in a peaceful with laidback environment, \u00a0I don't mind coming back again to escape myself from the city lives.",

They serve curry chicken rice and other western cuisine. There's quite a number of expats visiting, there's an old school charm to it.They allow dogs as I saw a little frail chihuahua sitting obediently outdoors. it's a Little out of place if you're not driving.I would say that there are many places who try their darnest to recreate a hipster/industrial chic meets old school but this is truly genuine.",

    "text": "I was going to give this 4 stars but getting to the place is so difficult even by car, due to the new roads and all. Once u reach though, it's a pretty neat place.Colbar or Colonial Bar is nestled amidst lush greenery - and not the artificial-looking, neat rows of plants. It kinda looks like something you stumble upon while trekking through the jungle. That said, it was pleasantly cool when I was there last evening thanks to the afternoon shower; I would think it might get a little humid on other nights. The high barn-like ceiling and large concrete floor space makes you feel like you immediately stepped back 60 years into the past where space was not an issue for restaurant owners. And they've cleverly kept the authentic \"kampung\" ambience with the blue-paint wood plank panels and kopitiam tables and chairs (love it!). It's actually a really old restaurant (thanks to my know-it-all boyfriend) and kudos to them for keeping it this way because the expats living in the area obviously love it. It was crowded even on a Tuesday night!OK menu - personally I preferred the Chinese food. Served piping hot, the horfun and stir-fried veg with garlic we had was better than your average zichar stall in the heartlands. The fish n chips was kinda 'meh' - nice chunks of potato but the fish was dry. Pork chop was alright too. The range of craft beer is supposedly impressive (didn't drink cuz working on my summer body). The great thing is you don't need to worry about being too noisy in the middle of the jungle.All in all a good place to chill with old friends, or with your german shepherd (they're pretty dog-friendly from what we saw). Just bring cash!",

    "text": "Finally managed to grab dinner here after 2 visits (both times it was closed) and I guess my expectations were a little high the 3rd time...But I digress. This place is so rustic, so vintage, so unintentionally cool... Everything the hipsters aspire to be, except for its authenticity. It was originally a bar for British soldiers half a century ago when Singapore was still a colony (hence the name).Location wise- difficult to get to without a ride (though not impossible). Decor- distinctive blue building with very simple, practical details, none of your carefully sourced vintage kitsch here. A bit too practical, felt even more run down than the hawker center opposite my house (but I suppose that's part of its authenticity).Food- surprisingly expensive (was not expecting $20-$30 meals here) though came in a good-sized portion. However, the taste left much to be desired. The ribeye steak I had was fine (but quite salty) but my dining companion commented that his mom could make a better version (yes he's biased, no she's not a chef). Mixed grill came with beans which were mehhh.Overall, it felt like hypertension on a plate.Would come again for the ambience and the drinks (looks like a very good selection of cider) but as for the food... Maybe not.",

Well, everyone has the same idea of course and come tonight, all the watering holes at Clarke Quay and Robertson alike would be packed with desperate alcoholics. To escape the crowd and enjoy an ice cold beer (or cider for me) the laid back way, without too many of the CBD worker bees or the local coffeeshop flock, I would head to Colbar at Wessex Estate, an up and coming dining estate. This is probably the most laid back hippie bar, old school Colonial style, in Singapore.Colbar, or Colonial Bar as it is officially known, was the canteen and unofficial mess for the old British army troops while it was still at Jalan Hang Jebat. The whole bar was literally dismantled part-by-part, and all the tiles, timber screens and swing doors were used for the reconstruction of the new Colbar. I'm glad they did all they could to preserve this bit of history. Simple and old furnishing- Formica tabletops, mini pale green tiles, faded old photographs on frames. Love the air of nostalgia and days long gone. I wish i could travel back in time..Basic Western and Asian fare is served here. The cooking isn't great but really, who goes to a bar for food? The highlight here is the impossible selection of imported beers and ciders (mostly English and Irish). Beer lovers rejoice! I saw my favorite Brothers Toffee Apple Cider here. Oh yea.The outdoor area is very open and i love how it's surrounded by an oasis of green. Listen to the birds and crickets sing in the background and occasional tune from the arty group next table (highly possible considering the crowd) while enjoying your happy juice. Cheers! You deserve it. ;)",

A tiny drawback is the location though, being tucked away in a largely upscale private residential neighbourhood with only one direct bus service (191). This is a great place to bring both new (and old) friends as you laugh the evenings away with blithe smiling faces while knocking back a few cold beers.",

The bread was even starting to get wet from the juice of the beef which was quite a turn off. And it was served on a side plate, the plastic kind you get at the coffee shop for you soft boil eggs.

The spacious outdoor sitting area makes it a very suitable chill out zone to catch up with a large group of friends, and tables can be moved around freely with the owners consent. The food, while reasonably priced, comes in a fairly small portion, so it might be wise to order some sides to make up for it. Last orders for dining are at 8.30pm but you're more than welcome to stay for drinks till closing. Dog lovers will be glad to know that animals are welcomed at Colbar, just take note that over the weekends, you'll get a lot of kids coming along as well, so it might be wise to leash them up.",
