    "text": "Yay! First review of 2017! Guess I'm a bit rusty, haven't written a review since end Nov 2016. Let me try to do a short & sweet review (I'm always trying to do short & sweet reviews but it always ended up being quite long-winded lol)Ok! Let's start. This is my 3rd visit to Saveur, my 1st 2 visits were to its flagship shop at Purvis Street. I will do another review of the Purvis Street outlet another time.I first visited its Purvis Street Outlet about 4/5 years ago. I was super wowed by the food then that if I was a Yelp reviewer then, I would probably have given it 5 stars. Why am I not giving 5 stars to it anymore, but giving it 4 stars now? Here's why:1) 4.5 stars for Service: Service was excellent. The wait staff assigned to our table was very diligent in pouring water for the 7 of us. They were running a full house and were short of staff with just 3 wait staff for the entire restaurant. Bearing this in mind, I think she did a great job - she was very courteous, apologising profusely when one of orders was mixed up and was really attentive to our table. 2) 3.5 stars for food: It is sad. A place where I would have given 5 stars for food 5 years ago, I would only give it a 3.5 stars now. The appetiser (salmon confit) and dessert (Pistachio Panna Cotta) were very delicious. However, their signature Duck Confit just didn't make the grade. It used to be truly awesome! It's really quite meh now. My 6 friends with me also share similar sentiments - they all felt that the food quality has dropped compared to when they last dined at this outlet 1/2 years ago.3) 5 stars for price: $29.90 for a 3-course French dinner is really really cheap by SG standards. Thus, based on this, I will give them 5 stars.Taking into account of the above, I have decided I'll give it a 4 Yelp star rating. But, I do hope they will work on their food quality so that Saveur can return to its former glory.Review: 1/50",

The restaurant was pretty small and there were quite a few open tables. \u00a0We decided to try their set menu which was a good price at $29.95 which included a starter an entree and a dessert. \u00a0The three of us tried different things and I decided on the French onion soup, the steak and chocolate cake. There was an extra charge for the steak.The service was prompt and attentive while the food was hit or miss. \u00a0The onion soup was a little lacking while the steak was medium rare while I ordered it medium. \u00a0The dessert was excellent.I honestly don't know if I will try it again but maybe when there aren't any options left.",

Its crowded, casual and loud.We ordered Foie gras, duck confit, salad, fries, pistachio wanna cotta. Duck confit was okay, it looks so dry in first place.Foie gras lacks full creamy taste. Fries were not seasoned properly. Service was okay, but seems like they need more people to cover entire dining area. Lack of flavor and poor service, this place is not for me.",

We didn't think much and enjoyed what was presented. Good to the eyes but the taste was nothing as good as it looked. in fact, we both had upset stomach after the meal. sad but true.",

    "text": "Located on the ground floor of Far East Plaza, is Saveur. It is right next to the Nasi Lemak stall.To sustain their affordable prices, they have jam packed the dining area, so it can get quite loud, which ended up with me getting a migraine and feeling light headed, as it was very stuffy as well.Make a reservation if you don't want to wait at least 30 minutes for a table.At each table, you will find a order chit with a pen, you can tick what you plan to order and the waitress will come around and confirm your order.It's always refreshing to see a bible verse on the first page of the menu :)1. Mushroom Soup $4.90++Served like a drink, it was very creamy and authentic, definitely not straight out of a can! 2. Pasta $4.90++Pasta - Entree portionI really liked the pasta, it was al dente, even though there was supposedly chilli oil, I couldn't taste any spiciness. The crispy little shrimps added a crunch in every bite! Highly recommended!3. Confit of Duck $13.90 ++The mash was like a fluffy pillow of potato! Any baby would happily lick this plate clean of the mash! It was deliciously tasty! The duck meat was also, very tender and it pretty much fell off the bone! The skin of the duck was very crispy and slightly oily. The sauteed mushrooms was juicy and they really didn't give us enough of these perfectly cooked mushrooms!4. Chicken Roulade $10.90++This was slightly too cheesy for my liking, but the chicken tasted okay. I wasn't a fan of this dish though.As the restaurant was very busy on a friday night, it took forever to get service. Everytime we needed either the order taken or the bill, it took forever. So please bring some patience and a very low level of service expectation and you will have a great meal :) The food is good and it is gentle on your POSB account!",

I was therefore surprised that I would find myself in a French restaurant in singapore of all places. Saveur is a hidden gem in Far East Plaza. The ambiance is nice, the service is mostly good and the food is excellent. In comparison to most eateries of this caliber in singapore, it is also relatively inexpensive. We tried the pasta, salmon confit, duck confit, sea bass, and basmati rice entree. For dessert we had the chocolate hazelnut mousse. The sea bass was definitely my favorite. The fish was perfectly cooked and the fried potatoes were seasoned perfectly. For about $15, it is such a steal!! The duck confit was also very good. I liked the mushroom and orange accompaniment :) I will definitely be back!! French just might be my new favorite!",

    "text": "Saveur Saveur Saveur... Been a while since I was back and oh my how things have change. While I still rate the food a 3.5* - 4*, your service standards have taken a serious dip. Maybe it's one off but it was so underwhelming (politely put) that it made me erase everything I remembered about this place. Well... Let's start with the food points first. If you're looking for affordable french food, Saveur is definitely the place to be. With Foie Gras with lentils at $7.90 and duck confit at $12.90, the prices of Saveur is a quite incomparable. And the food is pretty decent too! Some of our favourites include the salmon confit (which I adore), the Foie gras with lentils, chicken roulade, Saveur pasta ((the mince pork sauce and Sakura ebi adds a nice touch to the pasta), pork belly with lentils (though I have to admit that the skin could done with a bit more finesse as more often than not, it comes out a bit hard and chewy instead of crispy) and the duck confit (skin is nicely crisp, duck is nice and moist and the mash that comes with it is pretty good too!).Now for the bad points. On my most recent visit, they gave the order on the wrong table, in fact, it was a table that had arrived after we had finished our appetizers. Not too big a fuss as I know people make mistakes. When the GF's roulade arrived, I politely pointed out that we were still waiting on a confit. Waiter was polite enough to say he'll do a check. After checking, and realizing that it was sent to the wrong table (which we already knew), he decided to confront the waitress who sent wrongly instead of coming to me directly (he was 2 tables away asking the waitress \"why you send the duck to the other table? Wrong table\"), It took the same waitress 5 mins to come tell me it was sent wrongly (and judging by her reaction, she was definitely new and lost as to how best to handle the situation). This is where the nightmare started. Now I don't know how their kitchen works, but from my knowledge and experience, if you missed an order out, you re-fire it immediately to make sure it gets out ASAP. I waited, patiently... 15 mins... 20 mins... By than, the gf was done with her main. The same waiter whom I had highlighted too earlier, came to clear the table asking if we wanted dessert. (Ok, here is where I got a bit sarcastic, I admit that). I told him \"no thanks, I'm still waiting for my main\". He goes oh, and again, never gets back to me. Another 5 mins passed, still nothing, so I decided to get another waitress to check (I wanted the manager but he was busy). Told her if it wasn't coming, I'll cancel the order as I've waited 25 mins for it. She did a quick check and said it was being done and will be ready shortly. Now as far as I know, all duck confit are prepared ahead of time because of the 2-3 hours cooking time and popped back on the pan for 15-20 mins to crisp the skin. Finally, after 30 mins, I was served my main. At this point, I was already freezing and starving having been at the restaurant for 45 mins. Digging in, I was more pleased about finally getting food than the food being good, but my enjoyment was short lived as I kept biting into shards of shattered bones. Now I understand that you need to cut the leg (normally where the joints are) and in this instance, you were required to cut through the bone, but more attention needs to be paid on ensuring that these broken pieces of bone are removed before cooking or serving. Lucky for me I tend to chew throughly before swallowing but what if there were guests who took 2-3 chews before swallowing? They would have missed the bone and swallowed it instead, giving every opportunity for these sharp pieces of bone to get lodged or even cut their throat. This, to me, is unacceptable and to be fair, very dangerous. At a $3 chicken rice stall, yes, maybe but at a restaurant? That's a big NO. Overall, we'll probably still be back, but maybe not for the duck confit anytime soon.",

They were not wrong this was some of the best European food I have had in Singapore for a very reasonable price and friendly service. Highly recommended. The wine was also fantastic for $8 a glass. Hope they can keep up the quality with it turning into a chain already! Just don't expect the food presentation to be amazing. But if the foods delicious who cares.",

They have a $1 off promo on their house wine if you order a main course. Don't bother, order a proper wine. Portions are on the petite side, so make sure you don't come here starving.",

    "text": "second time to Saveur and a thumbs up once again. there wasnt a wait coming in on a Sunday evening so it started well. ordered the recommended fish main after trying the duck confit the last time round. it definitely did not disappoint - particularly. i liked the sauce drizzled at the side of the plate as it complemented the fish very well. the potato was also tasty! desserts including the chocolate mousse was delicious. the other dessert had an interesting foam-like appearance. It tasted of peanut and the thing that fizzles on your tongue. you know what i mean if you've tried it :)",

    "text": "This is a review for the Far East Plaza branch.Kudos to the owners of Saveur for serving up affordable, tasty and unpretentious French fare! The foie gras could have been a little crispier on the outside, but otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, which consisted of foie gras with lentils and onions, the duck confit, the capellini pasta with shrimp (DELISH) and duck salad. I actually like that the serving sizes are small because that means I get to sample more food! In fact, to be honest, I even think they can get away with increasing their prices; I'd be happy to pay more for the dishes - that's how much I like the food! Good job to Saveur and continue the great work in bringing affordable French fare to Singaporeans! One last word of feedback: would be nice if the cans of soft drinks are served cold, from the fridge, and not at room temperature.",

    "text": "came in on feb. 4th 2016 around 2:30pm. food was good, but not happy with the service. after my friend and i ordered, the waitress told me that the creme brulee is not available. so she gave me other options and i opted for the panna cotta. while eating, the couple on my right was served creme brulee. my friend and i looked at each other with a big question mark in our heads. few minutes later, the couple on my right got served with creme brulee. i never asked the staff why i was told it's not available because i was more focused on catching up with my friend. after we ate they served the lava cake that my friend ordered and handed us two spoons. immediately we assumed the waitress forgot the panna cotta so we finished it and continue on with our chit chat. 20 mins later a waiter came to us and wondered why we never asked for the bill yet. then i saw him walked to the kitchen, talked to one of the cook then grab the panna cotta, finally. mind you, i was going to let that panna cotta go..",

    "text": "Interesting restaurant concept - simple menu (1 kind of dish for each kind of meat), almost communal table, sleek interior, local chefs cooking French food, cheap price, small portion. I was wondering how did we end up waiting for 45 minutes before getting a table on this restaurant where there are plenty of restaurants in the area with less waiting time, but my friend told me that people did that because of the price. We ordered the pork belly with lentils, stuffed chicken with foie gras and risotto, duck confit with mashed potatoes, foie gras with apple sauce, and pistachio mousse. The pork belly and confit were a bit too salty, but the confit is fall off the bone tender while the stuffed chicken was very good. The foie gras appetizer is kinda funky tasting with the apple sauce combo, kinda mess up the taste imho. Pistachio mousse was too sweet for my taste. All and all, it's suprising to see a French restaurant serving a main dish for less that $12 in Orchard area, even if the portion is pretty small.",
