    "text": "The food tastes really nice! And the set menus look very appealing, though they all seemed to have at least one item that I'm not a fan of. Had two dinners here, one with a party of three and one by myself. This review covers both. When we arrived as a party of three there was a short queue. After a little wait we were moved to the intermediate waiting area where they have magazines and menus to explore. Good way to make a longer waiting time seem shorter. Service was very quick and precise. Orders are noted on a piece of paper (or pieces of paper in case of separate checks), checked if the order is correct and later on checked if all the ordered items have been delivered. I normally judge a sushi place by the crispiness of the nori, but the only item I had with nori (really) were hand rolls and those are somehow usually always crispy even though other nori items may not. Only one of us had a set menu. It looked really nice, but I can't judge about the taste. I really liked the texture of the salmon and the fact that the tamago wasn't too sweet. The ebi tempura was also very nice. The shrimp meat perfectly cooked. When I revisited this restaurant by myself. I choose to be seated at the bar as that would obviously go faster. The advantage of sitting at the bar is that the food goes straight from the chef's hand to you and you can watch the chefs prepare all the food. Disadvantage is that the conveyer belt keeps moving tempting dishes by at about exactly the right height and distance to grab some more (-;I have had a look at the 'fish market' where they sell all sorts of ready made sushi and fish to be prepared at home. The ready made sushi looked so much better that those of the supermarket on the same floor.

    "text": "Sigh. I think I set my expectation too high because my Japanese friend recommended this place. I got the Kurobuta Goma Shabu Udon, and while the pork was good, the whole thing was just... too sesame-y. You know how they sometimes serve you sesame dipping sauce at a Chinese hotpot place? It's almost exactly like that, except in this case the udon was drenched in very thick and creamy sesame dressing. It was nice at first but too much after the 4th bite. The place was spacious and comfortable, though. My friends and I ended up staying for almost 3 hours just hanging out. They also have a pretty extensive menu, will probably give it a second chance and try their sushi/bento box.",

It's a shame that it is inside of a shopping mall and the fidelity card is also very confusing system, I did not get my free aka and cashier took my card after first prize but there were three more to go.The combo was really good and enough of food for two.",

My fav includes:1) Ichiban Jyu - this is my hubby's fav as he digs the fresh salmon slices and the spicy chilli padi 2) Salad with Jap Sauce - I forgot the menu name of this salad dish but I simple love love love the thick salmon and tuna slices and that Japanese sauce that I cannot find outside!!

    "text": "Ichiban Boshi used to serve up very decent Japanese fare. Not any more. I've patronised Ichiban from day one, when they were first located at Novena, and originally positioned as a mid priced offshoot of Kuriya. I dare say the quality (and quantity) of food and service has gone down the drain. Sashimi is barely fresh. Portions have gotten smaller. And quality of ingredients has become mediocre. Barely value for money as it were. Service is harried at best, occasionally surly. And the kitchen misses orders with a regularity that is - frankly - quite embarrassing. This place is a shadow of its former glory. Its mediocre Japanese cuisine at best, and a bright shining example of all that's wrong with over-expansion and mass market mentality. Only eat here if you've no choice. Still better than other mediocre chain outlets like Sakae Sushi or Sushi Tei. But only by a bit.",

They have many set meals as options - curry, soba, udon, tempura, rice bowls etc and some hot dishes and of course ala carte sushi. No special lunch deals so pretty pricey for what you get. I didn't try the sushi so not sure that's good/value for money.. But the set menus are overpriced imo (average $20 and you don't get too full; maybe we just eat like pigs?!). Won't be back given so many other Japanese places to check out and with lunch specials.",

    "text": "This is a pretty average sushi place, but my colleagues and I come here for lunch anyway because it's a short bus ride from the office and the prices are fair, considering the quality of the food and the atmosphere.The weekday lunch queue can look a bit intimidating, but exercise a little patience and you'll be seated within 20 minutes. I'm also surprised at how efficient the service is, as we usually go in a group of 6 and everyone usually gets their food around the same time.Their bento sets are pretty good; my only complaint is that the amount of food you get can be a bit too much for someone who's not very hungry. My favorite is their aburi sushi; it comes with around 7 pieces and you get a clear soup with it.If you're not one to wait for a mass-market sushi meal, check out their Kuriya takeaway area. (Note: I'm not sure if this is something that I should separately review, as Kuriya and Ichiban share the same space and cash register, but have different names.) They have an amazing variety of rolls, bowls, nigiri, aburi... basically, a lot of what you can order off the menu at Ichiban, and a lot better than what I see at Fairprice and Cold Storage. I've bought a few things from them before and really enjoyed them!Overall, nothing to go out of your way for, but a decent choice if you're in Great World City.",

No one thing is extraordinary - but decent + decent + decent has to be much more thank decent, right? So in summary has a few things consistently right. The set menus look appealing though impatience takes hold and I have yet to try them. The agedashi tofu, most handrolls and Hokkaido cheesecake are worth a try.",
