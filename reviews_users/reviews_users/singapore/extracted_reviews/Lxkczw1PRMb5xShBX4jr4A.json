    "text": "Sometimes a restaurant provides an experience in addition to good food. The venue is beautiful - classic Peranakan furniture and aesthetics, with high quality service. Our waiter proudly described visits by Blumenthal and Bourdain. True Blue is culturally special, and a wonderful follow on from a tour of the Peranakan Museum next door.The food, though, is not mind blowing. The banana leaf salad was refreshing, and the Ayam Buah was rich and delicious. The Tamarind Prawns were not stunning, and the desserts were decent.Would I return? Absolutely. True Blue is a wonderful experience, and worth cherishing.",

It may be the reason that taste is acquired and my palate was not yet cultivated. The much recommended stewed chicken with black nuts looked dark and felt like Chinese medicine. The cured black nuts were not nutty and yet salty and bitter.Spicy banana blossom salad: refreshing and crispy. They used the flower of bananas to make the salad, and therefore blossom in the title.Crab and chicken meat soup: the meatball was not chewy and the meat was hard and starchy. Pass.Rendang beef: lack of the rendang flavor and the meat was a bit too lean.The only highlight the night was a cabbage stew with mushroom and black fungus. And of course, the fresh durian- I got a dollop of it as a side. One of my friends had to step out while I was eating the stinky fruit, because he could not stand the smell. Haha.. people are so different ;)",

My wife, her sister and husband and I went there for lunch. We loved the food and great service. We did not know much about Peranakan cuisine. So, we asked the restaurant staff to recommend what we should eat. Everything was fantastic!! The salad, soup, chicken with nuts (incredible), prawns, etc.If you are in Singapore, we highly recommend this restaurant. The exterior and interior are like a museum. Beautiful!! Don't rush it. Enjoy the food and atmosphere. Then go to the Peranakan Museum afterwards or before if you have time. You will get a better sense of the food's origin.",

    "text": "First, I can not write this review without considering another review that I need to compose. \u00a0That is for Blue Ginger, another Peranakan restaurant I recently visited.I've eaten at True Blue twice. \u00a0While the same exact food was ordered each time, the experience was considerably different.I will start with the consistencies. \u00a0This is with the food and ambiance. \u00a0Each time, the exact same dishes were ordered. \u00a0Each time, the food was simply amazing.The spicy banana flower salad. \u00a0I find this dish to be very refreshing and the presentation is quite lovely. \u00a0There is a mixture of \u00a0sweet, savoury, and spicy that comes together just right.tinyurl.com/9efxpoeThe first time I ever tried Chicken with Buah Keluak (black nut) was at True Blue. \u00a0I fell in love with the dish. \u00a0The richness of the Buah Keluak is simply amazing. \u00a0I've been told it is an acquired taste. \u00a0If so, my acquisition skills must be very good. \u00a0Because, from my first bite, I just wanted more. \u00a0The chicken is cooked perfectly. \u00a0It is simply a little pot of goodness. \u00a0If I had a complaint it would be that there could be more of it.tinyurl.com/8ehbqj6tinyurl.com/9ms74heThen there is the Tiger Prawns with curry leaves. \u00a0What can I say? \u00a0They are huge. \u00a0They are sweet and delicate. \u00a0They are as close to being lobster tail as you can get without being from a lobster.tinyurl.com/9scmpraI think the food at True Blue is very good.The other consistency is the room itself. \u00a0It is a beautiful room. \u00a0It has charm. \u00a0It feels as if you are in someone's home. \u00a0The very high ceilings give the room a feeling of space. \u00a0You feel like you have stepped back in time.Now, I must note the key inconsistency.The first time, I went with a regular who was introducing me to the restaurant. \u00a0The meal was well-paced and relaxed. \u00a0Dishes came and dishes went. \u00a0The staff was very attentive. \u00a0Overalll, it was a very pleasurable meal.The second time, I took a friend to introduce her to the restaurant. \u00a0 We arrived and we were quickly seated. \u00a0Soon after we ordered. \u00a0In just a few moments, the food began to arrive. \u00a0When I say food, I mean all of it. \u00a0It was all brought out at the same time. \u00a0There was no pacing. \u00a0It was not really a dining experience as much as it was simply eating. \u00a0We were finished in 30 minutes.True Blue is not an inexpensive restaurant. \u00a0I do not mind paying well for great dining experiences. \u00a0But, dining isn't only about the food. \u00a0If it was, I would eat every meal at a hawker centre. \u00a0When I am paying for an expensive meal, I expect it to feel like a experience. \u00a0 It is a shame. It was great food served in a great ambiance. \u00a0But, it felt like a fast food experience.If my second trip had matched my first one, I would be giving True Blue five stars. \u00a0My next trip will determine if they should retain their current four stars.The food is amazing. \u00a0The flavors are great. \u00a0The presentation is very good. \u00a0The room is beautiful. \u00a0There just needs to be more attention given to the overall experience.",

Last night we dined with a couple of friends of my cousin who are in town for business. \u00a0Luckily they are adventurous eaters. \u00a0They did have trouble finding it but seemed to enjoy the plush surrounds. \u00a0We sat in the corner with a full view of the restaurant and the china collection cabinet. \u00a0We ordered our favorites: the banana blossom & cucumber salad, sweet potato leaves, okra in candlenut sauce, black nut chicken, fried chicken in Indonesian spices, and beef rending. \u00a0The dishes came out of the kitchen at a steady pace. \u00a0Rice and tea were refilled plentifully. \u00a0I drank so much of the red date & longan tea that I had a mild sugar high mid meal. I cannot speak highly enough of the banana salad. \u00a0I have never been able to identify the banana blossom in the dish but the sauce is so good I don't really care what is in it. \u00a0I usually polish off the dish myself while people focus their attention elsewhere. \u00a0Like hollowing out their black nuts and chicken. \u00a0This is another stunning dish here. \u00a0The chicken is infused with more of the black nit flavor than other versions of this dish I have tasted. \u00a0The beef rending is simply superb. \u00a0I don't care for fried chicken but our guests fought over the last piece so it must have been delicious. plates clean the dessert came: pineapple tarts and some mango puree and pomelo for me. I hadn't gotten enough of pomelo from the juice which was amazing. \u00a0The pineapple tarts are homemade and you can tell. \u00a0Our guests commented that it didn't taste like pineapple at all. Either way, they ate them with delight. \u00a0We sat for a long time after the meal in deep conversation about the country. \u00a0The atmosphere in this restaurant makes you want to talk about important things. \u00a0After holding the table for over two hours we departed. \u00a0But it won't be long before I'm back for that salad.",

    "text": "5-star setting, pity about the foodTrue Blue is possibly the prettiest Nonya matriach in town. Gorgeous artwork such as the beaded slippers are displayed in one of the rooms, while another houses a breathtaking array of lace blouses. The ground floor seating area is the main hall, while a few private rooms upstairs and one on the ground floor are popular for wedding ceremonies and private events.Pity then that the food and service appear indifferent and lacking in soul. Ayam buah keluak was the best dish, while everything else really failed to exhibit depth of flavour. The beef rendang was tough and barely warm when it hit the table, the chap chye watery. Prawns petai style were not fresh and lacked in sambal. Oh and if you want extra sambal, you will have to pay for it. Not surprising then with the small sizes of the dishes that the bill quickly adds up. Desserts were overhyped; the \"best pineapple tart in Singapore\" was mediocre with its dried out jam centre not yielding any moistness.This is a really beautiful restaurant to bring overseas guests, but only the connoisseur will know that there are smaller, more boutique Peranakan restaurants serving far better quality dishes.",
