With Headchef Luca Beccali at the helm and a team of staff with great personalities, Basilico is a perfect place to enjoy delicious and fresh Italian buffet.When we think Italian, we will straight away think about the fresh produce that available in the country. Starting from seafood, meat, delicious cheese, salad, tomatoes and also olives. Basilico definitely tried to provide all those for their customers, including the remarkable list of Italian wine. Some the wines are also available by the glass.We were impressed with the food presentation especially when we saw the big island set up in the middle of the room. I walked around to see different types of cheese from soft burrata, to freshly aged asiago. Each cheese on display has the name, place of origin and information on which animal it came from. It was impressive, and I wish I weren't bound by time so I could try each cheese on display.Of course when we think cheese we will also consider the cold meat that we need. I stopped counting the amount of prosciutto and salami that I took. I wrapped some prosciutto on olives, mixed it with burrata and Roma tomatoes, as well as sweet cantaloupe. Moving on to seafood, even though there wasn't any Mediterranean water nearby, the quality of seafood at Basilico was really fresh. They have plenty of salad that can be mixed together with slices of tuna, salmon, and even lobster. I included some house-made bread and dips to complete the mini feast.Basilico also offers main dishes to complement your buffet. That night we tried the famous cheesy truffle foccacia, called 'Foccacina con Tartufo Nero e Robiola' in the menu. The well-flavoured foccacia was made in-house and served with generous amount of black truffle. I crushed the black truffle and spread it all over the surface of foccacia.Another dish that we enjoyed in the group is the Pentolone di Carne. It was served in a big pot and smoked with pizza dough on top. Underneath, there were tender lamb chop, pork sausages, grilled beef tenderloin, and some vegetables. This was only available until the 25th of September as part of Basilissimo Flavour of Autumn, so we were lucky that we were there to try it.Basilico also has its own dessert counter with gelati and beautiful house-made cakes. I was thankful that each cake was in a perfect bite size. I tried the Pistachio Cherry Mascarpone Mousse cake, Chocolate Mille Feuille with cute layers, Maple Hazelnut Financier and a small jar of Tiramisu (yas!).Basilico was chosen as one of the top restaurants in Singapore's Top Tables. We really loved the hospitality of each staff, the presentation of their buffet spread and the quality of each ingredient.",

    "text": "Sumptuous Italian buffet, especially on Sunday. Most fabulous is the cheese room; even in Italy, it is rare to find a place serving or selling so many different cheeses. The cooked-to-order raviolis with fresh truffles and the pan-fried foie gras are also delicious. The seafood is extremely fresh, even if they don't offer oysters. Relatively speaking, the mains (for which there are many) are the weak link here - we've all had better versions of the same dishes. Excellent, pro-active service staff. To a customer (unaccustomed with elegant buffets) who spent a long time picking bacon pieces from a serving plate of pappardelle, a busy chef offered him a big helping of the pork.",

The entr\u00e9e portion of your meal is a la carte, and you can choose from pasta and meat dishes. I've been eating a lot of cheese and olives lately, but unfortunately these ang mo foods are very pricey in Singapore. You can only imagine how I felt when I saw an elaborate display of all of my favourite things (and more!) when I walked in. What surprised me the most were all the condiments they offered. Things like chilli honey, truffle honey, different types of salts, bottles of olive oils and balsamic vinegars... heavenly!Truthfully, I was disappointed in my main. I ordered the beef tenderloin, and I didn't like it much. I should've gotten Miguel's order of the risotto; it was also served with some fatty bone marrow, and it tasted so much better.For $88 per person, I found the dinner buffet value for money. I was only miffed that they charged us for tea at the end (without telling us it would be extra) and each pot cost $9! Additionally, we noticed that there were some chianti bottles open with some wine glasses on the table near by the open kitchen, which leads me to believe we could've gotten some wine as well without paying extra. Next time!",

It's a brilliant showcase of the awesome cuisine of Italy and then more!Grilled Lamb Ribs - hubby ordered this as his main and the meat was grilled perfectly, tender and juicy. There is no funny gamey taste and the sides are also well cooked.Fresh Pasta with Bacon Chunks - I found the fresh pasta cooked al dente and the shape of the pasta is a little special, not long like spaghetti but way fatter! I didn't really like the bacon chunks though. Not my most favourite pasta experience. Should have stuck with my usual favourite and not be so adventurous. Haha..I remain a fan of this place and have converted my hubby too!",

    "text": "I think our lack of research on Restaurant Week became apparent when we arrived for our lunch booking and was informed to our surprise: \"It's a buffet!!\" We were not prepared for a buffet. By which I mean I had had a hearty breakfast mere hours earlier. But refusing to be cowed, we soldiered on to tackle their spread.The spread was not vast but definitely more than sufficient. Their antipasti and cheese spread was particularly impressive with more than 10 types of cheese available with a variety of bread pairings. Predictably, as an Italian buffet, their main courses were dominated by pasta, pizza and red meat. The lamb crackling was a stand out for me as well as the gnocchi. We were also brought a special cheese stuffed pizza with hints of balsamic vinegar which was delicious eaten hot. The dessert selection was also good given the overall size of the buffet. None of the desserts were particular knockouts (not even the tiramisu!) but was sufficient to wrap up the meal nicely. Singaporeans who are used to the buffet scene here might be disappointed that some of the popular buffet elements have been opted out of here - no seafood or sushi for starters and no towering chocolate fountain. I particularly liked that they stuck to Italian cuisine and executed it with aplomb. Service was fairly good although towards the end it became a struggle to get our water glasses filled or get the bill for payment. Overall, a very good experience with RW.",

Surely two cheese rivals could put aside differences for a day in the luxurious company of a dedicated cheese room?And what a cheese room it was with a glorious spread from fresh soft burratas of all kinds (smoked, regular, truffle, etc) to medium to semi-hard to hard, from sheep's milk to cow milk, from super mild to peppery and salty, from white to bright yellow and everything in between...Our weekly Sunday family cheese day reached the next level of amazing!El Quesito Peque\u00f1ito was heaven, trying the less salty, semi-hard cheeses, while El Queso Grande took down plate after plate of tens and tens of cheeses!As icing on the...ahem... cheese?, El Queso Grande was even selected as the winner of a Father's Day Maserati drive! \u00a0Halfway through our meal, he got to go for a 20 minute fun drive!The rest of the buffet was fantastic as well with plenty of delicious Italian favorites from frito misto with large succulent prawns to waygu lasagna to truffle focaccia. \u00a0The dessert spread also epic!PARTING THOUGHT: Basilico has one of the nicest high chairs I've seen at a restaurant Singapore and it's one of the only ones where the wipe stays white when I wipe it down! \u00a0Super clean!",

    "text": "My favorite Italian restaurant with a buffet spread. Tucked away from the bustle of Orchard Road, on the 2nd level of Regent Hotel, Basilico offers a warm, soothing respite from everyday life. The entrance of Basilico belies the fact that it is actually a pretty big place which can accommodate about 200 persons. It is also not very noisy as the tables are placed in different sections, affording some semblance of privacy and cutting down the noise. There is also a private room near the wine cellar if you have a big group. I have found the staff to be very accommodating, thoughtful and helpful. We had the \"royal\" treatment on my first visit because of a friend's incident at the restaurant previously. The service recovery included the private room, glasses of limoncello for everyone, special food (e.g. grilled lamb chops, foie gras and a truffle bread thing) and a birthday cake as my friend decided to have her birthday celebration at Basilico despite the incident as she loved the food. But subsequent visits on my own with other friends have found the service to be consistently good. So it is not a one-off thing. Likewise for the quality of the food. Sunday buffet has a larger spread as it includes the foie gras, lamb chops and other stuff. Saturday buffet spread is also good enough with grilled meat station, pasta station, pizza, the awesome antipasti bar, dessert spread and a smaller selection of Asian food for those who just need to have Asian cuisine. What I like is the dinner where you get a choice of main to go with the antipasti bar and dessert buffet. The selection is not overwhelming but what they have is all of good quality. Quality over quantity. I love the duck rilette, selection of cheeses, truffle honey, chili honey, balsamic honey, truffle cream, truffle salt to go with the cold meat and seafood. Seared tuna was very nicely done, the Angus semi-rare beef slice was fabulous with the truffle cream. Parma ham with melon slice, pimento, olive dip, grilled vegetables and different types of bread were just so good.I could basically dine happily on just the antipasti and dessert. The panna cotta was creamy and excellent. Likewise for the bread and butter pudding. So far I love everything I have tried at Basilico. The mains were equally good, not overcooked or dried out. I will definitely be back when I am in the mood for good Italian food.",

    "text": "Honestly, I had super high expectation of this place. With six 5-star reviews, I had this bookmarked and knew I had to check it out. So tonight, as I went through my bookmarks again and re-read the reviews for this place, my mouth started watering up and before I knew it, I was dialing their number asking for a table for 3. When I got there, I'd realised I'd actually been there on two other occasions years back but hasn't recognized it on yelp nor did I remember the name (now thinking about it, it was probably because the food was forgettable) but even having had tried it, I was still excited as I didn't remember much from my past experiences. We went for the 3 course dinner set (which includes an anti pasti buffet spread, a main course you can order off the menu and a dessert spread)Like most of the other reviewers mentioned, the spread is not huge. And so I was prepared for that. But did quality make up for quantity? I didn't think so. Sure, they had \"expensive, high quality\" foods such as truffle oil, olive oils, seared tuna, aged cheeses, prosciutto, cold cuts, scallops, octopus salads for the anti pasti spread - but were they ACTUALLY high quality or just expensive-type foods? I believe it was more the latter. To be honest, there wasn't one thing here I thought was amazing. I mean, it wasn't bad, no. But I can't say it was that great either. The breads dipped in truffle oil / truffle salt was probably my favorite. However, everything else was ok. The seafood salads were bland, the prawn was not succulent enough, the prosciutto didn't seem fresh (seemed like it was bought at cold storage) and even the main course (I picked the Sea Bass with Mussels and Artichoke) was average. The saving grace for the night, the desserts. Almost all the desserts I had were good from the tarts to the cakes (loved the peach tart and lemon meringue tart in particular) and especially their gelatos!! Rich, smooth and super creamy, might have been one of the best gelatos I've had in Singapore.But all in all, for about $78++ per person, it was definitely not worth it. The ambience and service was good, yes, but if I'm rating it based on food, I definitely will not be back.",

This is hands down one of the best buffets in Singapore, and one of the best Italian dining experiences.Being a buffet, it's really hard to breakdown what's good dish by dish. Let me put it this way however, there's free flow cured meats, free flow cheese (at least ten different types), a whole selection of olive oil and vinegars.I swear, there're few things that make me as happy as an endless supply of Parma ham. Salami. Of tasty cured meats and grilled vegetables. And while some people talk about how amazing the Bravissimo menu (where you pick you main and have the dessert and anti-pasti buffet) is, I'm more than happy to just take the anti-pasti buffet for dinner. Because everything you need to be all filled up is on that buffet... and who needs an actual main.Weekday lunches feature local foods, including surprisingly good roast pork, and there're expanded selections on weekends (Saturday offers free-flow Prosecco, Sunday, Champagne) in line with the Champagne brunches many other buffet restaurants offer. To really enjoy a meal at Basilico though, I'd highly recommend preparing your stomach from lunch. Eat a light lunch, maybe a salad, and just light snacks, and make sure when you sit down in Basilico, you're ravenous. :)",
