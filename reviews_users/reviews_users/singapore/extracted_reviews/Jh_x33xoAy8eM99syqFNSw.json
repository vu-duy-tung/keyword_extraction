I like the vibe in the restaurant with the decor and the music also, it is very laid back and not uptight like more formal places that serve steak. The steak was good, the fries were good, the cheese fondue and desert were also good, but what we enjoyed the most is our conversation with the owner. We had a great time!",

Soggy fries, gristly steak. About 30% was gristle. We complained, no one cared. Nail on the coffin? The lava cake was cold in the centre. I applaud the chilli mustard. It's a busy restaurant. I wish them well.",

    "text": "Value for money budget steak with all you can eat salad and fries.Despite the Brazilian name, it's more of a steak frites place. The owners of this restaurant are French. The menu is simple, S$19.90 gets you a sirloin and unlimited fries and salad. To upsize your steak, pay $5 extra.By all means it's not the best steak, you get what you pay for, really. Beef quality is only a small notch above Aston's or Jack's place. Fries are crispy out of the fryer, and for the salad, you get butter lettuce instead of iceberg lettuce. If you're in the mood, they do serve caipirinhas. :)4 stars cos it's value for money, but don't come in here expecting Morton's or Ruth's Chris. The food quality is only 3, but on a day when you crave steak, it's fine, really.",

Ok quality, I went there with higher expectations because of the 4 stars, but not expecting Ruth's Chris level. Came out disappointed. Gave us a tiny bowl of salad for 4 person though can ask for more. Fries are too soggy. Won't be back again for sure",

    "text": "I'm really really surprised that this place hasn't gotten more notoriety on Yelp. \u00a0Braseiro is a fantastic French grill in the the heart of Joo Chiat Road. The best deal on the menu is easily the signature Meat (you are getting the steak, no questions asked) served with an UNLIMITED supply of French fries and fresh lettuce. \u00a0P.S I wish they replaced the French fries with rice, kidding! Clearly, this is not an Asian restaurant :-)For doneness of my meat, I chose medium-rare. The rib eye steak came out fantastic. I had no idea the French could grill! You also have the option of three sauces: mango, mustard and chipotle to mix with your steak and fries. Don't fret, if there is no seating space on the first floor. There is a large 2nd floor with another set of 8 dinning tables or more. it's a bit neat to see expats living in the neighborhood playing a card game of sorts on the second floor during the evening. The big surprise is that there is a beautiful terrace in the back that accommodates 20 or more people, if you are keen for a fun night amongst friends under neath the stars and in an enclosed outdoor setting.Four stars for the price - $20 for char grilled steak and unlimited homemade fries and the fact you won't find this type of restaurant anywhere else on Joo Chiat or anywhere else on the East Coast for that matter.",

We took an Uber over to Braseiro. 2 storey little place, cute terrace on the second floor. The owner was so sweet...she is french, she and her boyfriend opened the restaurant, combining elements of french food (think steak frits in a Paris brasserie) and Brazilian ( think perfect Caipirinha in a bar in Rio). The steak was cooked perfectly..the homemade fries were to die for. Did I mention how delicious the Caipirinhas are?? Now for the kicker: $19.90 for the 200g steak and the fries and salad are bottomless! So glad we came here...you should too!!",

Prices are almost suspiciously reasonable for an area that seems to try its hardest to out-expensive Holland Village. The menu is simple and we like that: Choose your meat, and get unlimited fries and salad with it. Don't be fooled by the small downstairs space, they have an upstairs, both indoors with aircon as well as a small roof terrace. Upstairs is quieter, Joo Chiat isn't exactly a pedestrian zone. Owners and staff are nice and helpful and give the place a personal touch. Food is good. Another plus: They're open until late, including the kitchen. I believe there's food until midnight. There's many food choices in this part of town, but this brings something new to the mix.",

Here all the meat is very tender and the cooking as requested.To recommend",
