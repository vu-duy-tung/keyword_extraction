I've definitely had much better and reasonably priced steamboat. However, the poached chicken, chicken rice, pork chops and pork satay were delicious. I'd skip the expensive steamboat and just have everything else.",

    "text": "Classic underground \"steamboat\", but the actual highlights were the chicken rice and satay. The chicken rice is flavorful and thoroughly seasoned to a golden shade of brown by the chicken fat. The steamboat is more of an upsell and not cheap at S$17pp. Interesting way cracking raw eggs over a slitted spoon so it creates something like an egg flower in the soup. It's not many places that you can satisfy all three cravings at once.",

    "text": "Have been coming here for a good old local steamboat since I was a little kid. This place holds very fond memories for me and to me, the chicken rice and \u00a0remains awesome for me. The steamboat was also very wholesome to drink. I used to down 4 to 5 bowls easily on top of 2 full bowls of rice. There's something about the food here are 'opens' my third stomach. Heh...Today, my whole family came here for lunch and the chicken and rice still kicks butt, I found the soup base not as tasty somewhat. Dunno if it's because my tongue has gone slightly cuckoo, or maybe my brains just remember the 'good old times' to be always so much better?I would still need to go there once in a whole for my steamboat chicken rice fix. :)",

    "text": "I am a Hainanese. Whenever I told my friends about the fact that I'm a hainanese, the first thing that comes to their mind is Hainanese chicken rice. But of course, i have no secret recipe to any of the hainanese chicken rice. I would like to review on Thien Kee because not only that they serve excellent chicken rice, they also serve steamboat, which I feel is a pretty unique combination. Something which I always have with my family during Chinese New Year reunion dinner. Thien Kee offers nice smooth chicken. As for steamboat portion, you can either choose the seafood set or beef set to go alone with their nice fragrant chicken rice. They also offer sweet and sour pork chop. Even though, I'm not a pork lover, I think that it is a dish that everyone must try when you are there. There is one con that i would like to admit is their food is pretty pricey.",

    "text": "the missus and I are old school when it comes to food. Neither of us are big fans of the plethora of repetitive hot pot restaurants all over town. When it comes to steamboat, it should be done the local way like how families used to eat it at home during the Lunar New Year reunion dinner. Fortunately, Thien Kee at Golden Mile Tower is still just such a restaurant. Forget the china-style buffets or japanese shabu shabu, this is authentic Singapore style steamboat. The kitchen serves up all the ingredients on one plate. And there's also raw cockles which is a bonus of cockles lovers like us, Besides steamboat, Thien Kee being Hainanese is also famous for their pork chops and chicken rice. Both are great compliments to the steamboat but our favourite has got to be their pork satay. Not for the health conscious as each stick has equal amount of fats to meat ratio. The pork fats simply melt in your mouth along with the tender meat. For an air-conditioned restaurant, their prices are reasonable as long as you avoid indulging extra in the premium beef or pork slices for the steamboat. Be warned though, Thien Kee is still very popular especially with large families. It is almost impossible to get a table during weekends or special occasions. And when its crowded, its gets really noisy and difficult to get the attention of the service staff.Still, its one of the few places on our monthly must eat food jaunts.",

I don't want fancy sauces (or be charged per sauce), I don't want super thin slices of meat, sometimes I just want an old school steamboat the way my family would make it.What my family can't or won't do as well, which is also why this place is so awesome, is to make great 'pak cham gai' (steamed chicken) and pork satay and pork chops as well. Not at the same time anyway. The default rice they give you is also awesome chicken rice, not white rice, AND the Hainanese milk tea is awesome too. I'm a fan!",
