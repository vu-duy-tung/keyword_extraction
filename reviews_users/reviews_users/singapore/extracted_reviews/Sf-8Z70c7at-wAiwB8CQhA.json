    "text": "The ambiance of the restaurant was wonderful. It was very cosy and comfortable. \u00a0As I got further inside, \u00a0I felt a certain bohemian appeal just beside the main counter. \u00a0Delightful. \u00a0Usually, \u00a0I sit by the window, however, \u00a0I decided to occupy the table across the open space by the counter. \u00a0I took some time to decide what to have considering it was my first time here. I didn't feel rushed to decide. That felt good considering that this is one element that adds to the pleasure of dining.About the food, \u00a0I had to decide between 2 items, so I settled for the steak. \u00a0The quality of food was excellent. The steak was made exactly the way I requested. I enjoyed it.I'm intend to return to try out the other dish I was contemplating on whilst bringing company.",

    "text": "The place was dark and empty for a weekday lunch time. One had to press the bell for service. There was a note stating that the staffs were busy in kitchen. Pasta J's Nitro Coffee ($6.90+)Cold-brew coffee infused with nitrogen gas is released through a pressurized valve with tiny holes and as high pressure forces the cold brew past a disc, it creates a creamy, stout-like effect. Smooth, clean, lovely cold coffee with a much silkier mouth feel and there's a cool factor to a nitro pour when you see the coffee cascading. Winey sweet with a bit of prune and chocolate. Absolutely delicious!The coffee was light and chocolaty in taste. It really looked like stout.Mad Mac & Cheese 3.0 with Pork Sausage Patty ($16.90+)Beloved bacon and caramlised onions cheese sauce with short pasta and a sausage patty base.Not the usually kind of mac & cheese, as it was not the cheesy type that one was expecting. But it was kind of rich and creamy meaty sauce. Felt that the patty was a tab dry.The Ultimate Kaya Toast ($6.50+)Home-made kaya made with only coconut cream, not cocnut milk, egg yolks, no egg whites and so much pandan leaves. Smooth, velvety, eggy, coconutty and oh so fragrantThe toast was light and crispy. The filling was kind of savoury but not the usual butter taste. It was more of a unique taste.Service was not bad with ice water refilled regularly.",

    "text": "My dining companion and I agree this was a firm two star experience. The owner is great at selling you on his menu, but sadly our experience fell far short of expectations. The steak we ordered was just okay -- not bad (we loved the salt dips!), but certainly not worthy of the price tag. For ~$50 you can easily find a better steak on the island. We would rate the food at around 3 stars (4 tops).Other reviews (on other platforms) mentioned that the owner is passive aggressive and overbearing, and this is spot on. A simple question received audible sighs and eye rolls from him, along with thinly veiled rudeness. I won't go into detail, but will just say: as the owner of a restaurant, your goal should be to make your guests feel welcome and comfortable. We felt neither. The other staff were lovely, but clearly fearful of the owner, who seemed to rule (both them and his customers!) with an iron fist. Service was a firm 1 star experience. The value was also poor. Portions were not generous (especially for the price charged), and better food and value can be had in the Thomson area -- indeed just doors away -- quite easily. Our $6 dessert was microscopic (attaching a photo here with the pepper shaker for scale), and our upsized steak looked about the same size as the standard one (it was a different cut, for sure, but honestly this was a pretty mediocre rib eye). Value is also 1 star. There's great food to be had in Thomson, but this is one to miss in favor of some of the other great places nearby.",

    "text": "It is pricey and the pastas are salty. The service is terrible because the owner is condescending and thinks very highly of himself. If you order very little or just drinks please expect to be discrimated and treated differently from the staff. They have no shame showing their hatred for thrifty and cautious people. But if you are a big spender, you will be treated as royalty. Be wary when the owner jokes with you or engages with small talk, he does not want to make your dining experience better, he just wants to make you spend more.",

    "text": "Pasta J prides itself on delivering extraordinary flavours, and that they have done. Every dish is punchy, creamy or rich in its own way - all of them veritable umami bombs. It's also a dog-friendly establishment (at the outdoor seating area).We loved every dish we ordered, so I'll just mention three outstanding ones:Muddy mushroom soup ($6.50). The soup was really thick and chock full of mushrooms. It had a full-bodied mouthfeel, unsurprising as it was prepared on a pork bone broth base. Very rich and satisfying.Caramel carnivore pasta ($16.90). Loads and loads of sweet, caramelised onions that have been reduced to a thick and flavourful sauce, served with pork marrow and meatballs. This was crazy delicious.Pesto pasta ($16.90). The pesto sauce is a signature here (you can even buy some bottles to go), so this is a must try. The pesto is strong and punchy, with a clearly discernible taste of fresh basil, garlic and quality cheese.The recipes and flavour profiles are certainly not Italian. I'm not sure how to classify the food here - some sort of fusion? It's basically dishes of the chef's favourite flavours, turned up to the max.Service can be slightly slow, but the chef and his staff are friendly and earnest. Their passion and pride can almost be tasted.",

    "text": "The food overall is good, and worth a try. \u00a0I tried the pork shoulder. The taste is very good. It is done about average and worth a try. \u00a0The room for improvement are that it is a bit too oily and some pieces of the meat were slightly over cooked caused the texture a little dry/rough. The steak was awesome. \u00a0Very tender and juicy. Taste is also very good. The ginger wings is ok. \u00a0Taste fine and cook well. Only A bit too much ginger taste over powered all other taste. The laksa is unique. \u00a0This is a fusion between eastern and western food. Laksa serve with pasta noodles. \u00a0I really like the generous portion of the seafood serve with the noodle. Taste not bad. \u00a0I would recommend to make the dish a bit more sauce as it was a bit dry. \u00a0Also, the noodle taste good and texture is good. I would prefer it little firmer. The one thing that I found it doesn't match the place is the way they serve soft drinks. They should just pour it on a nice glass rather then serve the can. Overall this is a nice surprise find. The service is excellent and the environment feel very comfortable. \u00a0 I would go back again with friends and also for biz dinner. Be warn that The location is a bit hard to get to without a car. \u00a0Even with a car, parking could be tough. \u00a0 So take a taxi!",

    "text": "Visited Pasta J and was super impressed with their extraordinary food from appetizer to main course! I'm not a big fan of pasta but this place got me really HOOKED! Seriously!What I have tried and ordered:Power chowder soup ($6.9): This one was really really good! it was delicious, hearty and I wanted more. It's kinda different from the regular thick boston chowder but it's more of like homemade chicken soup style with tid bits of beef here and there which is just really amazing. I was impressed. Chicken soup ($6.5): A super tasty light soup, tastes just like how my mom would make and just the way I like it. Carnivore pasta (about $16): Amazingly creative and tasty pasta with simmered onion with black sweet sauce & homemade pork meatballs.Mac & cheese patty ($15.9): My partner didn't really like this one because according to him it was quite sickening but guess what! I LOVE IT! Again it's not the regular american mac & cheese, I personally think that this version is much better than the original one. The patty was not that juicy but I still could taste that it was really freshly made from the oven. Really loving the homemade fusion touch at Pasta J.Red devils chick wings ($10.9): I guess this was the only menu that we didn't like. The idea of baked wings is fun and healthy but the taste just didn't make the cut.Classic cr\u00e9me brulee ($4.9): Dessert time! It came in a super mini version and it's really good. I just find that the caramel on top was too bitter and thick, the rest was great! They even used real vanilla beans instead of artificial vanilla as flavoring and I appreciate that so much! I could really feel that they put lots of effort, dedication and passion in bringing up the utmost flavour for all their dishes, try it, you will not regret it. It's really a hidden gem! Perfect place for a family as well. There is outdoor seating for smoking area and dog friendly! I'll be back for more soups!",

To start my meal of, I had the mushroom soup which was interestingly served in a mug. I could instantly tell it was homemade with the fine string of onions and mushroom in it, it had the perfect texture. For the main course I had the boudarian I think that's what it's called. A+ for the presentation. Although the noodle was a little soft and the sauce was quite blend . All in all it was a good experience dinning in Pasta J.",
