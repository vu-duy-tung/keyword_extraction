    "text": "If you love strong flavours, you'll dig the Duck Noodle Soup (S$8) that's only served during lunch. Available in both spicy and non-spicy versions, I didn't like the spicy version as I felt the tart flavour of the vinegary chili sauce overwhelmed the flavour of the spices in the aromatic broth. The regular broth was generously topped with nutty bits of browned garlic. The silky strands of rice noodles, crunchy bean sprouts and chunks of braised duck made this a very comforting dish, especially on rainy days. The Phad See-Eu (fried rice noodles with soy sauce) is a great option too. Diners are offered a choice of pork or seafood. Priced at $8 for a regular portion and $12 for a larger portion, this is a great option if you'd like to share. If you're very health-conscious, you might like to know that the Phad See-Eu is a little greasy.PS: No service charge (10%) or GST (7%) at the present moment so prices are nett.* Closed on Mondays.",

    "text": "The place can get super crowded, especially after 7pm and on weekends. This is my 2nd visit, with the 1st visit a few (or was it several) years ago. I am pleased to discover the food is still as good as before and the place looks a bit more spruced up.It is a homely place with pretty authentic home-style Thai food. It has none of the sparkling glitz of the more modern Thai restaurants. It is a more down to earth place which focuses on cooking good food and not on its ambience. The menu is old and fraying at the edges, with several items either not available or only available for lunch. The main dishes are still there though. Order using the chit and someone will come along to take the order chit. We had the basil chicken, seafood tom yam soup and green curry chicken to share. All were delicious even though they did not look very appetizing, especially the green curry chicken and seafood tom yam soup. Cash only. The pricing seemed average, around $10 or more per dish (depends on the size).",

    "text": "The service at this restaurant is one of the worst I have encountered in all my life. The waitress refused me water when I requested for some upon seating by pointing at some house rules flyer they've put up. When I agreed to pay for my water or a drink she said that she refuses to bring anything till the whole group comes in. We were waiting on 2 friends who were at Bugis + which is about a 5 minute walk away from this place. I was extremely thirsty from all the walking & where I come from we don't even turn away our enemies when they ask for a sip of water. It is considered not just rude but extremely hostile to refuse someone drinking water in many cultures let alonein the hospitality business. She came back only to toss the menu at our faces instead of laying it down properly on the table & walked away without even paying attention to our reactions. When she came to take the order, she started giggling when my friend started asking her questions about the food & the restaurant's specialty dish. It didn't help that she repeated our orders by mumbling in a very thick accent with little regard for if we were following her or not. I found her entire demeanor extremely unpleasant, ill mannered to the restaurant business & wanted to throw the menu at her face at this point but for the sake of public decency I waited on silently to see if the food was worth all this.The food in all fairness was not bad but there was nothing extra special about it either. I tend to enjoy my food more when I'm positively disposed & where the service is keen, attentive, efficient or at least pleased to attend to a paying customer!I've had equally if not better Thai food at Thai Smile Cafe, Spicy Thai, Lerk Thai, Jane Thai, Bali Thai, Jai Thai & E-Sarn Thai which in my opinion tops the list.I am a firm believer in service quality especially when it comes to food which everyone is rather emotional about. Cordiality immediately translates into Kitchen etiquette vis a vis hygiene & nutritional concerns. Disrespecting your customer to the callous point where they want to walk away from your establishment & being brash with your clientele can make its way into poor food hygiene practices. Give this place a miss if you don't want to be subjected to the worst service ever, unimpressive food & an ambiance without an A/C that boasts of dated Elvis Priestley photos.",

There are other competitors but the cooking is done to a higher standard without being too fancy.Am a regular of the lemon chicken - most places make the sauce over-guey and sweet but here its a light sauce, and the fried without being too greasy. Papaya salad is great too but only served at lunchtimes. I also recommend the coconut juice - freshly cut with copra.Sometimes the service is a bit off but I bear it given the quality to value ratio of the food.Don't be surprised if you have to share a table!",

It is definitely a no frills Thai eatery with authentic Thai fare at affordable prices. The Tom Yum Seafood Soup was a good dish to start off the meal. It was a good balance of spiciness and sour, and the tanginess made the dish really appetizing. The seafood was sufficiently fresh too, and at a generous amount. My favorite Thai dish to try at restaurants is the Phad Thai, so I had to try it here too. It was passable and rather flavorful but not exactly up to the standards of most other Thai restaurants. The service was pretty disappointing too. They are inattentive and they ignored us a few times despite seeing that we have called for them.",

    "text": "The food here was very good. Spicy and authentic. I visited this place a few years ago, with a local, during lunch time. It was airy and resembled one of the local coffee shops. The menu was pretty extensive, with pictures to depict each dish. We ordered a variety, as there was a large party of us. I remember that the pandan leaf chicken was very tasty and I thought the Pad Thai was of decent standard - better than what you get in the US but not up to the standard of what I've had in Thailand. The fish cakes and olive fried rice was also very tasty, though the latter was a bit greasy. We didn't order it but I recall seeing fragrant rice being served in a pineapple husk at other tables, at it looked very tasty. We had a filling lunch, and barely had space to stuff down any dessert, but at the recommendation of my local friend, we tried the mango sticky rice, which tasted very rich, creamy and wonderful. A little too much for me, so I managed half a bite. it was very tasty, like the ones I had in Thailand, but tasted fairly fresh and not like those that are prepacked and sold from the fridge. Our meal ended up being fairly pricey at almost 80 USD for three people, since this wasn't even a restaurant, but it was well worth it for an authentic Thai experience in Singapore.",
