Or you could sit at the long communal table that occupies most of the inside of the cafe. The communal table, high ceiling and floor-to-ceiling glass shop front makes the space feel a lot more open.There are food options like quiches, sandwiches and breakfast/brunch items. A different menu is offered for brunch, lunch and dinner. There's also wifi and ample and strategically placed power outlets so you can pull out your laptop to work. Toby's takes its coffee really seriously (you know, Third Wave and all) so there's a clear focus on coffee appreciation. You can buy coffee making apparatus, books (including one written by the owner) and other assorted coffee paraphernalia.",

It's fine to have a long butcher block table for seating everyone but no attention was paid to the order in which people came in and asked to be seated.

All round applause.In summary, one of our favourite places for brunch, weekdays or weekends.Edit: We just tried their muesli. Divine.Update 25 Feb 2014: We noticed the strong truffle flavours overpowering the mushrooms and have provided feedback directly in the past. The mushrooms are still too heavy on the truffle side - can we please have an option to reduce the truffle or eliminate it altogether? Sometimes, we just like the mushrooms sauteed lightly with salt.Update May 2014: Fly discovered in breakfast half way through the meal. Staff did not offer to replace or strike off the cost of the dish. That's not the way to run a business in Singapore's competitive F&B scene. Seems like attitude and service mentality is dropping. Didn't have a chance to see if they have taken input about the mushrooms as there were no mushrooms on the day.",

They have been roasting and serving cups of caffeinated (or de-caf, depending on your preference) goodness since 1998.Stepping into the cafe, you're immediately greeted by a gorgeous handpainted mural on the main wall, as you see above, which depicts the point of harvest to the end product. This is representative of Toby's mantra towards coffee appreciation, \"for us, it is all about the journey of the bean. We take pride that we do our business sustainably and when it comes to the process of creating that perfect cup, we also take it very seriously.\"Serious is Toby's Estate about its coffee as you see the sheer varieties of ways you can get your cup done - espresso machine, chemex, clover, woodneck, V60, siphon... and before you get your heads in a mess with the sheer amount of geeky coffee terms, rest assured that the baristas will be more than happy to explain to you the various ways to preparing the drink. We love the idea of \"man\" versus \"machine\" as a way for coffee lovers to explore how the different preparation methods creates different coffees.We had a cup of espresso and cappucino each to taste the blend on its own and with the addition of milk. Needless to say, we were suitably impressed as it has a bold body, definitely will work for those who love their shots!Good news to those who love to work outside, Toby's Estate is wireless equipped so you can drop by for your appointments and meetings.",

Hailing from Australia, this franchise was a sign that our coffee scene is now big enough to sustain an overseas franchise since the Second Wave coffees. What it brought along was a huge space along the Robertson Quay area. It has very high ceilings and a very casual friendly atmosphere. What I really liked was the fact that they are really serious about the coffees. You can tell with the bean bags and apparatuses lying around. They bring in their own beans and there are sampler sets for you to try.The baristas are also very friendly and will speak to you about the coffee if you asked. When we went they have already ran out of food. Generally, try to avoid cafes on Sunday late afternoons if you want food!",

There were not enough people that looked like a frikken HOT MESS because they miscalculated how far it is from Clarke Quay and walked a good 20 minutes under the brutal sun right after lunch time. (I may or may not be talking about myself....) If it's your first time visiting and you cab it, note that Rodyk St kind of dead ends and looks pretty residential. Keep walking towards Robertson Quay, hang a right and you're there! The first time I stopped by, I ordered a cappuccino and a pastry. I admired the excellent latte art; the pastry was nothing to Yelp about. The second time I visited, I ordered the iced chai latte, and that was an epic fail whale. I kid you not, it was 10% chai at the bottom, 90% milk, and a tall cup full of ice, all for the lovely price of $6. Blech.I also find it strange how they don't have a bathroom inside the shop. You have to go outside around the corner. I actually went to this bathroom, and it explicitly says it's not a public bathroom but only for the residents of the building. Weird. Despite the warning signs, I used it anyways and unfortunately discovered that it needs some maintenance. There were only 2 stalls, and neither of them locked correctly. Overall, decent place to check out if you need to get out of your bubble. Just beware of the bathrooms.",

They have introduced consistency into their coffees, such that the espressos are flavourful and well made; and the milk-based espressos are also tasty. If there's a slight grouse, it would be the use of the Greenfields milk - I'm not really a fan of that as it's rather thin and not so creamy. What I like is the variety in the beans that they use. Toby's brings in beans from all over the world, and so you have very interesting variants in the hopper ranging from a sweet Ethiopian Yirgacheffe peaberry, to full bodied Mexico, to jammy Costa Rican - and if you are in luck to visit when they have COEs on offer (certificate of excellence coffee) - by all means, try that. you'd be pleasantly surprised. The food - it's alright, not stellar. The eggs could be much more runny and use cream; although the mushrooms and bacon are alright, you can't go wrong with them. The ambience is lovely - a high ceiling, by the river - very Australian. Reminiscent of Seven Seeds in Melbourne, or St Ali.",

Went for lunch and there were multiple service errors. After 20 minutes I was told \"there is no mango in the kitchen sorry so we can't make your salad\". I said \"ok please give me the menu back and I choose something else\". So I reordered and then they brought out my salad anyway with no mango and put it on the table. The two waiters argued, took the salad away and my new dish took another 20 minutes. Then the avocado was rock hard and inedible. Waiter reluctantly exchanged. They also botched coffee orders. Waiters running to tables, appeared anxious and very poorly trained. Coffee and location great hence the 3 stars but that was a stretch. I won't be going back. It's pretty basic, train your staff!",

    "text": "This is one of many place along the water at Robertson Quay and I know what you are thinking - yet another place that is just over-priced and does not really deliver nearly what one would expect. I can really understand that view as many of the places around here cater to people with more money than sense and taste but I do not believe that Toby's Estate is one of them. The coffee here is actually really good, they serve excellent filter coffee and the ice coffee is also one of the better ones I have had in Singapore. Espresso based beverages also do not disappoint but I seldom order them since the other coffees are so good and in my view a good filter always is preferable over an equally good espresso based beverage.The food is not bad but a tad bit on the pricey side so I do only eat here when my hunger coincides with an intense need for coffee. Service has always been very friendly here and I can see that as a regular you tend to get certain benefits as I have noticed that when I have been here a lot during periods (when I stayed close by) they always manage to find a seat and also sometimes give some free tasters of some coffee.I can agree with Michelle M that the bathroom set-up is a bit strange but that seems to be the same for several places around there but I never had any issues with it being overly dirty or messy - maybe it is for once the ladies room that looks worse than the men's room :-)",

When we finally got a table, it was by the window. It wouldn't be so bad if the sun didn't shine through and heating up our area. On the bright side, my friend(nearest to the window)'s coffee remained warm throughout.I ordered scrambled eggs on toasted brioche, $10, with Harrisa sausage, +$4.50. The eggs were tad overdone to my liking instead of runny and creamy. For a moment, I thought I was at McD for Big Breakfast. Very plain and ordinary.Not going back anytime soon since its just another cafe serving plain pricey eggs. But hey, at least they have free wifi. ;)",

I have never had a bad or off one here.2) Try the Gilbraltar for a bit more intensity than a latte and a bit more volume than a piccolo3) They have lovely shattery-crust croissants here!4) Love the decor and chill vibe5) Fluffy scrambled eggs6) A bag of Rodyk blend beans..costs $12.50. That's cheaper than many of the roasters in town and this blend really works with milk-based drinks. Chocolatey, well rounded, not too much acidity and therefore a crowd pleaser.7) It's always a plus looking over the river enjoying your drink. Makes you feel you have all the time in the world and you're really out of the \"city\"8) They serve a brioche here with great texture and lightness..so much so that I quite often order scrambled eggs on brioche to share..on the side of a croissant of course. Tip: Ask for jam, it's free!8) Consistency (see 1, 5 and 8)",

There's also a couple of coffee places where you can sip your coffee by the river. Of course when the weather permits.. Sat by the river for a bit and it started pouring.. Coffee on a weekday afternoon was awesome nevertheless. *Thumbs up*",

Fortunately Yelp came to the rescue and recommended this place that was just across the river from my hotel. I must admit that I am not really used to the cafe culture here in Singapore, namely because they pretty much all have table service (normally I simply go to the counter, order my coffee, and then find a place to sit). This place wasn't all that bad, and the Brooklyn Style that I had was pretty nice. They also made a decent coffee (not that I am a real coffee connoisseur, but I decided that since I was overseas I would try out the coffee in as many places as possible). The service was pretty good, though not the quickest (but I found that that was the case in most places in Singapore anyway - maybe it is not as hustle and bustle as I am used to in Melbourne). It's also a pretty quite part of the city as well, and the riverside view makes it great for the experience.",

    "text": "Toby's is just a stone's throw away from Kith Cafe which is also very popular with the residents in the area. Shall try that some time soon. Love the old warehouse feel to the area. Very grunge but they have since refurbished and repainted the exterior. We have noted this place some time ago before Toby moved in. Something we noticed about the recent development in the cafe scene is that they all kinda have the same decor. Brick walls juxtaposed with a black, white and wood theme. A little raw, a little unfinished. I'm not complaining because i like it this way. The flooring of my future home would be cement or i would have a cement wall feature.Nice airy space to chill at but my main complain is that there are not enough seats in the house! The concept of communal dining is cool but it's not very comfortable squeezing between different groups of people early in the morning just to get my caffeine fix. The space could be better utilized i feel.The coffee is easy on the palate. I usually don't take coffee without sugar but after having Papa Pahleta's, i concluded that good coffee doesn't require any additional sweetening. I would put this in the same category. Can't say too much about the coffee as my throat was crying for help from the soreness and i think coffee made it worse. :(Ham and Cheese Croissant was really good. The pastry is very light and airy and extremely crispy! I would love for the centre texture to have more pull though. The pastries are outsourced. S said something about it coming from Bread Project. I should just go straight to the source to get my croissant. S had the poached egg with salmon on brioche. My first impression is that it looks a lot like WH's but the brioche is not toasted and this is more buttery and very fluffy. Shall try the brioche with jam next time to get a more accurate feel to the texture. Nicely done eggs but i wouldn't say that this dish is spectacular? Not something i would definitely come back for.W showed up at Toby's after we were about done with our breakfast. He had the Toby's Breakfast- a composition of scrambled eggs, back bacon, roasted tomatoes and peppers and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. The eggs sure look runny enough. Shall try this when i feel better. Anyway, it's breakfast till 3pm daily so more incentives to come down. Downside to this place is also the really slow service. They really need to work on getting the coffee and food out faster.",

    "text": "My new favorite joint for brunch even though it isn't very accessible (my definition: near an mrt). I hate driving into town area because I am pretty bad at directions and one wrong turn can cause me to loop around a couple ERPs. Not cool. The nearest mrt station is clark quay but it's still quite a far walk. Despite the long \"hike\", I managed to reach this place, hungry. All that walking really works up an appetite. The food1. Soya milk latte- Loved it. It had the perfect nutty taste. 2. Croissant with scrambled eggs & honey bacon- Cindy Q was spot on in her review of the its croissants. It has to be the best croissants I've tasted!!! How on earth did they make it so flaky and crispy??? Magic. The scramble eggs were pretty good but then again how wrong can one go with them. Child's play. The honey bacon on the other hand had an interesting smokey flavor laced with a sweetness that reminded me of candy bacon (Epic Meal Time). It was ok I guess but I think I prefer my bacon savory rather than sweet. Lovely ambiance It's like walking into a cafe in Australia - Chilled, laid back and with a big coffee roaster. \u00a0I would love to bring a good book here one day, read it while sipping on my latte and nibbling on those magically croissants! Overall great experience. Perfect for a lazy weekend brunch. Best thing is that they serve brunch till 5pm so for all ya sleepy heads out there who cannot get up in time for a MacD's breakfast, this is perfect.",

Small amount of pork and lukewarm fries. \u00a0After I finished the sandwich and about 25 min later they then decide to bring my wife's chicken salad. Very low quality chicken and the pieces were practically cold. They charge $18 for this \"dish\". I suggest to visit one of the other small restaurants near by.",
