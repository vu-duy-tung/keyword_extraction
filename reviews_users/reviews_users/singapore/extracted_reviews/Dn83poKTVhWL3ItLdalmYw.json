I did notice that it was packed almost all day, every day no matter the time nor weather. My partner and I stopped by one Sunday afternoon for a lunch and iced coffee after I discovered its notoriety. You order and pay at the front counter, so its better to know what you want before you come in. Its usually pretty busy but especially packed in the mornings. The menu is pretty limited and I didn't have the chance to try too much, but there's a nice variety of items to choose from whether you want a snack or a meal. I've had the chicken curry with prata and it was delicious. The curry itself was rich and flavorful with a couple of bone-in pieces of chicken and potatoes. The prata is perfect for soaking up the spicy curry goodness.The iced kopi was a perfect mix of rich, strong coffee and creamy sweetness. And it was perfectly priced. All in all, the meal is incredibly tasty and the price can't be beat. If its reputation doesn't pull you in, its value will.",

The eggs were done perfectly and the toast had a good amount of coconut jam (kaya) and was crunchy enough to soak up all the egg deliciousness.

I always get the laksa (although personally, I feel the Katong Laksa tastes better) and chee cheong fun. My friends are fans of the mee siam.I like their teh-si peng which is just nice in its sweetness. I top my meal off with a local dessert like cheng tng or grass jelly with longan. \u00a0Price-wise it's still in the cheap range although it's expensive for a kopitiam.

    "text": "Killiney Kopitiam is a mainstay in Singapore's breakfast culture, and has been for many years. \u00a0They know it too - they sell small jars of fresh kaya that can be carefully packaged for a long flight (well, Singapore's just one island, so all the flights are international). \u00a0There's a number of things you can buy as gifts - I have actually done this and it's a great gift for friends or family.Come to Killiney during morning primetime, and you'll likely be queuing up outside and/or hovering around a table waiting for people to finish feeding themselves. \u00a0The queue for ordering food is also a bit annoying - it's disorganized and right next to people sitting at tables. \u00a0Frequently you have to move around to let servers go by or let customers in/out. \u00a0Considering the size of the place, this should be expected (and in Singapore space is at a premium), so it's not a huge issue. \u00a0Your average hawker center probably has less room to maneuver. \u00a0As for the food, it's the best kaya toast I've had in Singapore, the laksa and mee rebus are both great, and their kopi c/teh c/yuan yang drinks are all top notch. \u00a0The french loaf kaya toast and soft-boiled eggs combination is something I've recommended to many of my friends before, and also unique to Singapore. \u00a0I've checked - no one else sells a french loaf like this. \u00a0It's kind of like banh mi bread - a baguette that's toasted and crispy but soft and fluffy at the same time. \u00a0The kaya is fresh and when combined with the melted butter, is heaven in your mouth. It's hard not to eat 2 of these french loaves when they're SUCH a good value. \u00a0A french loaf, 2 eggs, and a kopi will be about half the price of any other sit-down breakfast in Singapore. \u00a0Sometimes the staff can be a bit rude - probably because they are an institution for kaya toast and the queue is pretty constant during the entire morning. \u00a0Most of the time I had pleasant experiences with the staff, and most of the time my table was clean when I sat down (again, this is about what you can expect with low-cost casual dining in Singapore).I should say this - this Killiney Kopitiam location is the original, and the best by far. \u00a0I have always had great quality food here, whereas other locations are VERY hit-and-miss (usually a miss). \u00a0I started going out of my way to come here, even though I was working within walking distance of the Raffles location. \u00a0Just don't think that the rating and quality of this place will be the same island-wide, or at the airport.",

You know they have been there a long time, not the sort that people buy at furniture stores for the \"vintage look\". The curry chicken and mee rebus here are famous, and for good reason. The curry chicken is one of the best, if not the best I have tried in Singapore. It's super thick and aromatic and the chicken and potatoes are cooked just right. You can really taste the fresh spices and coconut that have gone into making that delicious gravy. It also has a real kick of spiciness, not like the lousy curries you get in food courts that are oily and one note. If i were to nitpick, I would say that sometimes the chicken has that faint chickeny taste you get when the chicken used isn't super fresh.",

    "text": "Hands down the best traditional S'pore breakfast I've had during my week here.The first kaya breakfast I had in my life was at the big chain, Ya Kun Kaya Toast. You can see it in the food levels of Singapore's many malls around the city, or like we also did, visit the original location on China Street in between Telok Ayer and Chinatown. But Killiney's original location on Killiney Road a little walk's away from Somerset was just as quaint and much more delicious in my opinion.Their system of ordering is at the cashier once you've found a table. You can't order items unless you can provide a table number, so if you're with a buddy, have them take over a table while someone else puts the orders in. MAJOR KEY. We had their soft boiled eggs and kaya toast, mee cheong, mee siam, and iced tea/coffee. We ate like kings for about $20-$30 I believe. I don't remember the actual amount, but it should be around that price--pretty great for Singapore.My favorite was their kaya toast. SO much thicker and still crisp compared to Ya Kun's, and their spread was less sugary like Ya Kun does it. I even bought a jar of kaya spread to take home to the States! I loved it THAT much (kaya is essentially pandan, coconut milk, eggs, and sugar). I can't wait to use it on my toast at home. Their iced tea was SO good, not overly sweet like at Ya Kun, and definitely freshly made with fresh foam on top of my cup. We were so excited about our first order, that at the end I put in an order for mee siam after looking around their shop at the photos. That wasn't my favorite item, but the egg was cooked to perfection, and the sauce was a hint spicy with lots of flavor. Service is QUICK and their workers are all bosses at efficient food running and order taking. Hats off.",

The coffee is pretty good as well. I've eaten a lot of laksa over the last few weeks and I think Killiney Kopitiam has the best laksa broth. \u00a0Its very flavorful and well balanced. The toppings are pretty basic in comparison to most places but it gets the job done. It's just so good. Don't miss out on ordering it. They have a system for ordering. This is important. I travelled solo, so it was a little difficult to get it down. Step one, find a seat and mark your territory (put an umbrella down on the table). Step two, note your table number. Step three, go up to the front, place your order, you must give them your table number. \u00a0You'll see a menu on the wooden panel on the left side of the cashier, point to things if you need to (I did). Step four, wait for your food and enjoy.",

In fact, I went here twice for breakfast while in Singapore The Kaya spread that had a unique combination of mildly sweet yet savory taste to it. I'd recommend the french toast and spread some of that kaya goodness with it. The coffee also goes well with the toast. The coffee is also well balanced and goes well with the toast (keep in mind that the coffee with cream is sweet due to the condensed milk that they use so order without sugar so you can adjust the sweetness after you've tasted it). I also order the laksa which was creamy and cocconuty with a slight spice kick (it wasn't too spicy but just enough).",
