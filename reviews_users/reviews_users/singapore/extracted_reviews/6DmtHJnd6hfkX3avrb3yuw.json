    "text": "Food is relatively mediocre! (I would give it a 2 Half star). They serve OK beef Tajine ($18) but it's not really authentic Moroccan style. It actually taste 'homely' more than anything else. Though I must say that it's quite addictive (albeit the diluted sauce). Good to go with either rice or pita bread (just a note that they don't serve handmade pita bread, from the taste and texture, it feels like they source their pita breads from local grocery stores). Also ordered their mixed chicken & mutton kebab. Honestly, the rice wasn't to my liking. However, chicken kebab lifted my palate for... a bit. Not your 'wow' kebab but good contrast compared to the rice. I would not order this dish again. To be charged $23 for a kebab rice dish like this, personally it's a nope for me and I would rather try it elsewhere where you get QUALITY kebab for that amount :) Ok so we heard some reviews about their iced mint tea and had to try it. It was appetising and refreshing! But not a game changer haha. (A note here, I actually think they reuse their straws :X the straw had some sweetness on the tip and it was wet with water. Maybe it wasn't washed properly, or maybe it had contact with some sugar water. Whatever reason, not taking any chance. Removed the straws immediately).The motherly lady boss served us free hot mint tea as a form of dessert after our meal , well, this was nicer than the iced one (just a little too sweet)! The mint flavour was stronger and overall blends well with the tea. Would I have both the iced and hot mint tea again? yup! But not with the straws. Service was good. The lady boss was super enthusiastic about almost everything haha. Didn't get the vibe that it's a restaurant I would try again! Good experience on morrocan food in Singapore, though it wasn't anywhere near authentic! It's not easy to find good Moroccan food in Singapore anyway, if you do, let me know! :)",

    "text": "While I am sure there are plenty of other great reasons to eat here, there is only one that truly matters: the Moroccan iced tea. Simple as that. We first ordered dinner and a bunch of waters. I'm not sure what came over me, but something compelled me to order the Moroccan iced tea. It must have been divine intervention because it was was pure heaven in my mouth. I cannot begin to describe how amazing it was. All conversation on how good the food was immediately turned to the drink. Everyone was trying mine until it was completely gone. The owner of this little shop was SUPER friendly too. She was very cute and accommodating for our big group. I sincerely miss this place.We actually went back one day to order JUST the teas. She was completely fine with it and brought it out to us right away. You need to go. You need to get the tea. Now.For those of you reading this review outside of Singapore, by your plane ticket now. And go there. Now. Seriously. Now. Oh, and bring some back for me.",

    "text": "This is was my first time eating Moroccan cuisine, and it was very, very cool. We started with a starter, a Red-pepper filled with meat-filling. Then, a rice/lamb briyani-ish dish, though it tastes very different to a briyani, the Kasba Lamb rice is a MUST-TRY! Basmati rice goes really well with the soft lamb meat. The pita bread is pretty much like all other Middle-Eastern breads, but light and yummy.What I Love: The Beef Kofta Tagine. It's really yummy, traditional and authentic! I found the apricots an interesting twist - savoury and sweet. The Mint Tea is Fab too.What I Don't Love: There is no air-conditioning. And the place is pretty tiny. Now, a hot tagine-stew doesn't go with no air-conditioning. So, prepare to get a little stuffy and sticky. The staff do take a while, but the saving grace is the owner's wife - she's really sweet, almost like a Mom-figure and she took care of us.",

We brought visiting friends there with their two little girls, and the place became absolutely terrible. The girls simply had grilled chicken and lamb, with some fries and salad and they both got sick and threw up all night and the next day. The rest of us were also very disappointed with our meals, only the beef tajine was passible, but still way from a good meal. This used to be a very nice place with delicious food, but it is not anymore. Do not go there!",

The fruit and peppermint teas are also lovely, turkish style and strong.I went back a couple of months ago at night, and it's a small place, and perhaps it was a bit crowded that night but I waited for an hour just to get my food, which was a bit surprising because I usually had pretty good service at other times. The proprietress is a lovely and friendly lady though, and I'm hoping that was a one-off thing because I do like this little establishment, small and snug along the walking end of Bussorah Street with a nice view of Sultan Mosque.",

I had the Moroccan iced tea (iced tea with mint leaves) which was awesome. As mentioned in the other reviews, that was liquid gold for such a hot day. For lunch I had the mixed kebab plate (lamb and chicken- I liked the chicken better.) The kebab plate came with hummus, a salad and french fries. The hummus was nice and thick, salad was good although the fries could've used a little flavor. Make sure to ask for the chili sauce as that made the meal complete.",
