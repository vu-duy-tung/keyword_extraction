    "text": "My family & I love this restaurant & also known as Golden Spoon. Die die must try their famous signature dish, crab with bee hoon soup. The soup is so tasty & the crab is fresh. Their appetiser - deep fried oyster roll with mayo is delicious, too. We love their fresh fish & vegetables & as if we're dining in one of the good restaurants in Hongkong. Noticed lots of expatriates dining in this restaurant. The boss told me that he has lots of dining places & Red House Seafood is one of them. Prices are reasonable. This restaurant is always packed & so is their car-park lots. Worth your calories.",

The stock was robust with wok hei and the bee hoon soaked them all up. The coffee pork ribs were very aromatic and well marinated and the HK steam fish (we took soon hock) was fresh and steamed just nice. Service was fast and polite.",

I liked the gravy A LOT. Some must orders: crispy squid and their crispy tofu. Both were standout dishes that got everyone in my party fighting for thirds. Haha",

    "text": "A fairly typical Chinese restaurant serving up the usual dishes, the one reason why I keep going back to Golden Spoon is for their crabs, specifically their Crab Bee Hoon. Located in the heart of Tiong Bahru, near the market, parking is relatively easy as there are a lot of lots to be found just in front of the restaurant. The only issues I have are with the staff, who don't really seem to understand you, so patience is definitely required. One thing to note when dining, especially when you're going for the signature Crab Beehoon, is that the later you go, the higher the chances are that you'll end up with only the larger crabs left. Meaning if you're planning on going on a date, its best to get there early to choose a smaller crab or you'll end up like me having a 1.8kg crab to share with my friend, which honestly, is a little too big!",

    "text": "Great crab bee hoon. Although I have to admit, I haven't had crab bee hoon anywhere else, I can't imagine it being any better than this anywhere else. Another hidden gem is the cereal tofu - think cereal prawns, but with less cholesterol. Chunks of egg tofu coated in garlicky corn flakes and deep fried, but the kicker is the sweet pumpkin sauce underneath. You don't get that with the prawns, and it's great. I just found out that this isn't even on the menu anymore, but they'll still make it if you ask.",

    "text": "Another one of my local favorites. The chilli crab is really good here, and is the mee goreng. I also tend to order the famous crab bee hoon, but for me it's slightly inconsistent- sometimes good, sometimes not memorable. The drunken prawns are another of my favorite orders here, and my wife, loves them. The broth is strong, and the prawns very fresh. The pumpkin sauce tofu is also delicious. There is much more seating outside than inside, and sometimes the fact that it is right in the car park might be irksome. Once, during the the height of CNY, they set up a tented area next to their restaurant, and the breeze was very welcome there. Also, BYOB is free. Highly recommended.",

Food came out promptly and service was good despite the huge crowd.Crab bee hoon: soup is really tasty and blends really well with the bee hoon. The crab is really fresh and big. Their most popular dish.Thai style pig trotter: one of the best I've eaten. The sauce is not too sweet and goes really well with the crispy skin and tender, juicy meat. A must try!Cereal tofu with pumpkin sauce: cereal is very crispy. Egg tofu fried in cubes. The creamy pumpkin sauce has a tinge of sweetness which blends perfectly with the cereal and tofu. Another awesome dish here.",
