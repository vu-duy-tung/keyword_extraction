    "text": "Employees Only is one of the few cocktail bars in the Tanjong Pagar area that's open on Sundays. As with most fancy cocktail places in Singapore, drinks here run for about $25++ each. I enjoyed the Ready Fire Aim cocktail, a refreshing and smoky mezcal-based concoction with pineapple and lime. If you enjoy lavender, go for the Proven\u00e7al cocktail, which has a strong floral profile balanced with a heavy measure of gin.Be warned that this bar can get quite noisy. It's probably not the place to visit if you're looking for a quiet place to grab a drink.",

Break out your wallet, as drinks will run at 20+$, but I don't feel cheated on the quality, quantity or originality. Try the West Side or Ginger Smash. For good, we started with the Spicy Crispy Prawns. They were a bit of Singapore meets LA. \u00a0Spicy yet sophisticated. Dinner was the Porterhouse Pork Chop. \u00a0Perfectly prepared and presented. Service was fast and professional. Will return",

The cocktails were well made and satisfying, the appetizers were even quite good, but the entrees were underwhelming and uninspired. Note, the food was cooked well, but for the price, I expected more flavor, better presentation, something more. Would go back, but only to have a couple drinks or an appetizer - so many places in Singapore to have a nice meal with better value for the price - hence the 2 stars. \u00a0Recommend making a reservation for a table if you want drinks - walking out, the bar was overwhelmingly packed, could barely walk out. Also, the staff was quite nice and attentive despite being very busy.Food:Steak Tartar - really really good. The final mix of ingredients is done at the table and tailored to your preference. highly recommendBone marrow poppers - pretty good, but would rather get two steak tartarsPork chop - Juicy and well cooked, but lacked flavor. Comes with black eyed peas which were nice, but I didn't care for the combination.Trout - Cooked very nicely, but I thought it lacked seasoning or flavor. Comes with a frisse which was really really good.Kale - side. Sauteed with a little garlic, good, but pretty standardDrinks:Manhattan - very goodGinger smash - nice and refreshing",

    "text": "The drinks here are amazing. I loved everything I ordered!!! Even though they could cheat and pre-mix their drinks, they don't do that so everything comes out tasting fresh and amazing. When I wasn't very inspired by the menu and ordered some classic cocktails, they also added their own twist to them and they were absolutely delicious. I've tried:- Fraise Sauvage: perfect for someone who loves refreshing drinks - extremely delicious- Provencal: super interesting with savory notes from the herbes de provence, loved it!- Ready Fire Aim: did not expect to love this because of the mezcal, but they balanced out the smokiness really well- Red Dawn: delicious and didn't have the earthiness from the beetroot at all- Mata Hari: so. yummy. The pomegranate juice really adds a delicious touch- Ginger Smash: refreshing- Negroni (single glass, not on the menu): super well balanced, very good version of this classic drink- Aviation (not on the menu): absolutely delicious! They added their own twist to it and I loved it- Corpse Reviver (not on the menu): delicious but I preferred other versions I've had- Daily Daisy: this was a frozen Sangria when I visited recently, it's deliciously spiced and not too strongThe food here is also pretty good for a bar - not exactly the only reason I'd visit but they were delicious. The skate wing is a specialty here and tastes great with the paprika sauce and spaetzle.The service is great if you're at the bar and only have to deal with the bartender. If you're seated at a table, the service can be slow because the servers are super busy.If you make a reservation, you'll have to sit at a table away from the bar since the bar is walk-in only. Also, if it were up to me, I'd only visit in the early evening. It gets crowded, rowdy and the music is way too loud past 9pm. For a bar where I'd like to have a nice conversation with people, it's extremely unfriendly when it gets that late.I'm taking one star off for the price (so. expensive.) and the noise level past 9pm. Otherwise, this place has 5-star worthy drinks!!! Would love to visit the NY store to try their drinks.",

No experiments.While the bar is slioghtly smalle than the original, the drinks are the same. Jalapeno infised chartreuse and other self made ingredients are also availiable there as their well known food. If you want to be on the safe side when getting a drink, you will be fine here, if you want some more local style, you need to go elsewhere.Slightly more expensive thant the other SG bars.",

Food menu was boring, with no appetizers or sharing portions, making it really hard to order. Worst of all were the stuck-up servers, who kept trying to push us new drinks... and were so pushy they eventually ended up pushing us out of the bar.Honestly, I feel sorry for New Yorkers who have to put up with this kind of condescending service.

The art deco decor is on point and they have most of the same drinks with a couple of other new favorites. One of the bartenders beat out his fellow coworkers in a competition with a drink called the Black diamond. It was the best drink I've had in a long time. The staff was unreal friendly. We're only in town for a short period of time 3 nights, but I'm making sure we swing back by one more time. Can't say enough good things.",
