    "text": "Hi everyone, took my children to Red House last night, for Chilli crab before end of Xmas holidays and before they fly back to stormy UK and start of 2014 University term. Was not disappointed, booked a table for 7.00pm as thIs is one of top places for Chilli Crab in Singapore and on last nights experience, much better than Jumbo. We had a mixed calamari starter platter, followed by their signature lobster coated in custard sweet sauce, very yummy, then a chilli crab and a black pepper crab and buns. Also ordered asparagus and greens. Service was very helpful, and reasonably priced for 4 wanting something a bit special and 3 hungry teenagers. My children really enjoyed the food and we had a great messy time with our fingers, which adds to the occasion. \u00a0Will definitely return again. Only reason I have not scored this 5 stars is that I reserve this for a fine dining experience and special places. The red house is a special place for chilli crab and the sweet sauce, but it is a casual dinning experience, and \u00a0a very good one.",

    "text": "I am always on the hunt to find good dim sum. I heard about Red House (RH) from numerous friends and saw posts on social media, so I decided to give it a try since it's also been around for 40 years. Located on the corner street of Robertson quay area, RH is one of the most modern looking dim sum restaurants I've ever been to! The d\u00e9cor is simple yet sophisticated; I can tell you that you won't be able to guess its age by looking at the ambience.Let's talk about the food. I love that the menu has pictures. They don't have too many varieties just the staples. And I love all the basic dumpling choices they have for both steamed and fried. They have your usual Har Gow, Siew Mai and they have some unique ones you usually don't see on a dim sum cart like the hand made signature Takesumi Chilli Crab Bao, NOW that is a MUST TRY!!!!! Honestly, everything on the dim sum list IS AMAZING. Apart from dim sum, I love their braised spinach tofu and chili crab. The House Mee Goreng is worth to try as well. They also have a great beverage list (alcohol and non alcohol). The service is friendly, although can be really slow at times but the delicious food could make up for it.I was stoked when I saw they have 40% discount for dim sum (like all dim sum, yes including the chili crab bao), which is valid until december 2016. Congrats on turning 40 Red House!",

Ordered signature Singaporean drink \"Singapore Sling\", calamari with salted egg, bamboo clam with garlic sauce, brown chilli crab, Taiwan grouper, sambal kangkong, mee goreng and seafood fried rice. Service was excellent, the staff was attentive, fast & friendly. Most importantly, the food was exceptional especially the calamari, clam, sambal kangkong and brown chilli crab, respectively. Those are in my opinion is a must have at Red House. The others were okay, nothing to brag about. The Singapore sling was too sweet for Asian's taste and weak on the alcohol. The restaurant can fit in quite a bit of people, nice atmosphere and clean. Will go back to eat here if I visit Singapore again.",

    "text": "Summary: Very good crab; reasonable, if expensive market prices; worth trying as a special occasion perhaps, but not worth going to regularly.Upselling:They try to nickle and dime you for every little extra thing without asking: tea, napkins, nuts. So if you don't want something, make certain you say so before they bring it (or right when they bring it to the table).The waitress recommended the Chili Crab using Alaskan King Crab as the most flavorful. The price wasn't too bad for Alaskan King; at 188 SGD per kilo* it's competitive with the market price in the USA. The downside is that the minimum order - even for one person - is 1.5 kilos.Since I didn't expect to return to Singapore anytime soon, I decided to go all out. (And just to break up the flavor, I had a couple of steamed buns and a small side of custard prawns. I don't advise this. It's way too much food for one person.) Although the chili crab was very tasty, there can, indeed, be too much of a good thing. It would be better if they let solo diners order an appropriate amount for one person.",

But everything in this pre-fixe came out was great, and dim sum style.My favorite starter was a fried shrimp with a wasabi sauce on top, it was perfectly fried and the sauce gave it a spicy tang which fit perfectly. The chilli crab in the red house special chilli stew also did not disappoint with a perfect amount of spices. The seafood fried rice was a flavorful side and so were the small dinner rolls that were almost sweet and also a perfect side with all of the seafood we ate. The mango Pomelo with sago dessert was a simple dessert that were not used to in the states but also delicious and sweet. Great spot for my first trip to Singapore.",

Use their one provided wet wipes for this messy eating. They could provide more wet wipes or have large table napkins. Used their sink near back of restaurant to wash sticky hands.",

The pork ribs was the worst I've ever had. The mushroom dish was chewy and horrible. There was an unidentifiable chewy shellfish(?) in there. The pasta had a very off taste.",
