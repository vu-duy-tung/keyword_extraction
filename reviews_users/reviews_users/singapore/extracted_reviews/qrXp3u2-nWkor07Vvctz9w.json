    "text": "Very pretty decor on the 3rd level (think we were banished up there for Restaurant Week :p) with silhouettes cut-out on the wall, chandeliers and lamps. There is a framed open prep area which made it looked like you are looking at a painting with people moving in it. The place is quite dim, with natural light coming in from the window. No candles or anything on each table for the dinner service. As we were there for Restaurant Week dinner, we got a choice for mains (black cod or wagyu beef cheeks). Service was good but nothing outstanding, just what you would expect from such an establishment. The starter of hokkaido scallops, ponzo dressing, pear and pomegranate was refreshing and good, especially the pomegranate which was crunchy and sweet with a hint of tartness. The bread basket with butter was just heavenly. The crust was crispy with chewy softness. Plus they were warm. Nice! So good that it went so well with the lobster bisque. I liked how each dish was made, at least the last part to being done, just before they were to be served. I could see one of the staff in the prep area straining the bisque. The creamy lobster bisque was topped with a dollop of cream and was very flavorful, with tiny slivers of lobster meat in it. I had the grilled black cod with prawn risotto and kaffir lime leave emulsion. The black cod (aka sablefish) was good, reminded me of the chilean sea bass with its buttery tasting meat. The prawn risotto was ok, though the kaffir lime was a nice touch. I had a taste of the wagyu beef cheeks. It was so tender it could just melt in your mouth, and had a very strong beefy taste, much like bovril. Very nice and definitely one of the dishes to get. Dessert was a disappointment and I was looking forward to it. Earl Grey creme brulee with hazelnut sugar and yuzu jelly sounded so promising. Unfortunately the whole thing did not gel. I could barely discern the Earl Grey taste and the jelly on one corner of the creme brulee just tasted strange. Not a big fan of the entire thing.",

    "text": "F&amp;B restaurants are a dime a dozen in Singapore these days and most don't even survive past a year. Which is why Absinthe is great, because despite its lack of publicity and even a change of location, it has been doing good since i last wrote about it 2 years ago (read about it here).We sampled a couple of dishes from the ala carte menu. Pictures show tasting portions.Hamachi ($26), carpaccio of marinated yellow tail kingfish with Aquitaine caviar, cucumber and baby cress. A simple refreshing start to the night.Saint Jacques ($26), seared Hokkaido scallops, braised daikon, wakame and lemon thyme emulsion. Lemon line. This dish really whets the appetite with the tangy citrus. The braised daikon, while being thoroughly flavored, still maintained some bite to it. The scallop was perfectly executed with a light pinkish center and lovely browned crust.Next, the Foie Gras Po\u00eal\u00e9 ($29), Chef Francois' rendition of pan-fried foie gras served with warm blinis and Morello cherries. I found it little on the oily side and the blinis soaked up all the excess oil. Needless to say, I left it after a bite. If foie gras is your thing, opt for the Foie Gras Terrine ($29), layered with smoked duck breast and served with warm brioche (read it here). It's certainly a hot favorite.The Bisque ($15), lobster (of course) was a little on the bland side. A hint of cognac was detected but did not lend any flavors to the soup.From the mains, the Canard (lunch $40, dinner $42) is a French duck leg confit should not be missed. Nice crispy skin with a well flavored and moist duck meat. Comes served with Sarladaise potatoes, mushrooms and Madiran wine sauce.We ended dinner on a sweet note with the Vanilla Madeleines ($15), freshly baked-to-order and accompanied with Valrhona chocolate mousse. Freshly baked goods are always good but this changed my mind about the boring madeleines.",

    "text": "Came here fueled by dreams of getting high/drunk/inspired by the Green Fairy.We were here on a weekday evening and made reservations, though we needn't have bothered because the restaurant was practically empty when we were there at 7. We were seated outdoors in a prime spot beside the Singapore river, which made for a great view and some (ok make that a lot of) attempts to get a nice profile-pic-worthy photo, much to the chagrin of my dining companion.The dinner set had been replaced by another culinary summit set, so we decided to get our dishes a la carte instead.Started off with the bread and butter. Butter was of the requisite room temperature and tasted ok, but nothing too special. We shared the Foie Gras Terrine, which was decent but really didn't go well with the brioche it was served with. The brioche was just too cake-like and the textures didn't blend well... A harder type of bread (like those they use in tartines) would be more appropriate.For mains, my dining companion had the rabbit while I chose the canard (duck). The rabbit came in 4 interesting-looking rolls. Tried some of it- I've never had rabbit before but it was tender and the meat was bouncy (wonder if it's an innate quality of rabbit meat)... So bouncy that even in death the rabbit was bouncing off my knife and I had some difficulty cutting it. Thankfully my teeth were much less forgiving. My dining companion was commenting that it tasted a bit fresh (the other word is undercooked) and towards the end he was openly commenting about being infected with Tuleremia.I had the duck, which started out promising but ended up being a bit meh. It looked more appetizing than the rabbit, though less exciting. The skin was crisp initially but I later realised that there was a lot of underlying lard and ended up scraping them all away. The meat was slightly dry, with thick, coarse fibers... Not exactly the smoothest things to eat. It was also not very evenly cooked (the bright side of this is that a small spot in the middle tasted pretty good).For dessert we shared a 3 cheese platter.. Nothing mindblowing here. And lastly the drinks we came for (after all, the only reason why Absinthe was even on the radar was it's namesake). I had a shot of Absinthe B55 (Absinthe, Baileys, Coffee Liqeur) while my dining companion had a mixture of absinthe and gin (I think). The thing about absinthe is... Well try it at least once for the experience but the thing is so darn high in alcohol content that as I sipped it I could literally feel my lips turning cold from the alcohol evaporating off my skin. And every sip (and I do mean the tiniest of sips) was a mind-blowing, nose-clearing experience. No wonder people used to go blind from drinking this pure! 3 sips and I thought I was going to be knocked out. Worried about how I was going to finish the whole drink.Thankfully that worry was soon left unfounded as I knocked over my shot glass. What a waste of $16 though ):Spent $230 for 2. Menu's available online if you want to be specific about the prices.",

    "text": "If you have a lot of time to enjoy a meal as you would in France and order off the ala carte menu, Absinthe scores 4 stars.If you're there for the set lunch and holding a business meeting, Absinthe is a 1 star.Average that out and you have 3 stars.The deets on 4 stars: I have had wonderful, long dinners at Absinthe while it was still at Bukit Pasoh. The food is classic French, service was proficient and I generally walked away feeling that the prices I paid were worth the experience. Nothing terribly memorable but decent enough that I would consider returning.The deets on 1 star: Had a business lunch at Boat Quay, where the restaurant moved about 2 years ago. Both the food and service was a mess and I will preface, I am holding Absinthe to fine dining standards because that's what the restaurant markets itself as. There wasn't a door host when I arrived and the waiters seemed to consciously avoid trying to seat me. After about 5-10 minutes, someone attended to me but then sent me to the wrong private room and sat me down at an incorrect table that consisted of about of strangers having a private event. I looked at them and they looked at me like we had just seen the grinch. When I clarified with her male colleague if I was at the right meeting, he exclaimed \"oh no. Oh sorry please excuse the receptionist downstairs\". I'll let you decide how to respond to such a situation. At lunch itself, the starters were served quickly but our mains arrived almost half an hour after our plates had been cleared and the same thing happened with dessert. Most of the table (including me) didn't get to see dessert anyway because by 2.15pm (we arrived at 12.45pm), we had to get back to the office. If a restaurant is trying to court the business lunch crowd (which Absinthe certainly is with their set lunch menu and private rooms), the unspoken protocol is to serve everything within an hour or at least by 2pm. \u00a0China and Tower club, all the Fullerton restaurants etc do it. Lastly while our starters were fine, the portions for mains were unbelievable. The seabass I ordered was the size of my clenched fist (and mind you, my hands are really small). I ended up going to Golden Shoe hawker afterwards to eat some fishball soup because I was still hungry.So pick and choose when you eat at Absinthe :-/",

We started off with a glass of Champagne, the Delamotte brut, which is actually a sparkling wine from Nappa but very nice regardless, a nice way to start the evening. My fianc\u00e9e started with a Sauvignon Blanc, Sancerre, hard to go wrong with Sancerre. It is always rated ~89 on Robert Parker so... a good choice.I started off with the Pan Fried Foie Gras, Morello Cherries and Blinis. Very nice, not the best I have ever tasted but very solid. Blinis are a nice touch compared to the more traditional toasted country white bred.I then had the Veal chop, Pan Fried Milk Fed Veal Chop, Creamy Mash, Cep and Blue Foot Mushrooms Fricass\u00e9e. AMAZING and HUGE. So either share, or be ready to eat. The meat is quite light compared to beef but very tasty and the mushrooms were excellent. A big bravo to the chef.I finished off with the 6 cheeses set but since I could not decide on which one to pick for #6, they gave me 7. I took the Comte, Epoisse (I highly recommend), Vacherin, Gorgonzola... all excellent.I found a fantastic red wine but since we had 2 bottles for 4 but of us were not drinking, I cannot remember the name of this excellent Bordeaux wine. It is a second wine of a famous Ch\u00e2teau, was price around $138, it was a good choice. I was expecting it to have a little more tannins but it had amount of fruit and acidity so I was pleased overall.",

I am not a fan of greens and avoid salads to the best of my abilities. However, the grilled marinated baby octopus was delicious and I polished off half my salad with the help of that. My dining companions had no problems finishing the whole course and said it was one of the better salads she have had.The second course was Cream of Wild Mushroom, which wasn't bad but wasn't too impressive as well.For the mains, we had a choice between a fish and pork. My guest went for the Crispy Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly with Star Aniseed Jus, Beans and Potato for which she had nothing but praise for. The pork belly was crispy, lean and I have heard plenty of other patrons compliment the dish as well.I, on the other hand, was craving for cod and thus had the Black Cod with Prawn-Crushed Potatoes and Chervil Emulsion. The fish was cooked almost perfectly, just slightly overcooked but still retaining its juices and a translucent colour. The prawn-crushed potatoes were delicious while the chervil emulsion was negligible. Satisfaction for my craving attained!Lastly, deserts consist of an Upside Down Caramelized Apple Cake with Vanilla Cream which I personally enjoyed and found was a great end to a delightful meal. The vanilla cream had a strong fragrance of vanilla beans and enticed me into finishing deserts despite feeling full to the brim from the previous three courses. Good thing the portions aren't very big here (which is a pity if you have a large appetite).For the full review and more pictures visit voraciousappetite.wordpr\u2026Thanks!",

Red wine and a chocolate tart. True to form the meal was good. Not outstanding or memorable, but good. Service was attentive we had a great time.",

    "text": "Restaurant Absinthe is the brainchild of Chef Francois Mermilliod and it showcases his talent well.Food : We highly recommend the Pan Fried Foie Gras with Warm Blinis and Morello Cherries, which had a beautifully caramelised crust that was deliciously crispy, contrasting nicely with the tenderness of the foie gras, while the slight sourness of the cherries was a welcome detraction from the richness of the dish. Another must try is the Bouillabaisse \u00e0 l'Absinthe, a fish and seafood bouillabaisse which from all accounts, was the best we have ever had! The dish was rich with hints of spice, chock full of seafood such as scallops, king prawns and mussels and served with a rouille (garlic and saffron mayonnaise made with olive oil) and warm crusty bread. The bouillabaisse is well known to be a signature of Chef Francois, who came up with his own version when he was unable to find one he really liked.The Roasted Black Cod Prawn Risotto and Kaffir Lime Leaf Emulsion was yummy, the freshness of the cod enhanced by the buttery creamy flavour of the prawn risotto, which was given a tangy lift by the kaffir lime leaf emulsion. We certainly left the restaurant spellbound and yearning for more!Ambience : With its walls a soothing shade of pistachio, its chairs upholstered in a lovely rose and its friendly professional service, it is certainly a walk in the park to feel at home in the restaurant's cosy ambience.Service : Great but somehow couldn't shake the feeling that it was better with Philippe Pau helming the service team.One of my favourite French restaurants.",

I enjoyed the food; mind you, it was not mind blowingly great, but with consideration to the price and ambience, the restaurant would easily command a 4-star rating.unfortunately, my visit was marred by the fact that the 15% dbs card discount wasn't applied by the staff. even after questioning, the staff insisted that the discount wasn't applicable. after verifying with DBS, I found out that the discount was actually applicable in this case, but was not applied.I emailed the manager to voice my discontent, but received no reply regarding the matter neither. suffice to say I shall not be visiting this establishment again. -2 stars for disappointing service.",
