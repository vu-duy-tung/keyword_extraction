    "text": "I ate at this branch of Nam Nam the day after I dined at the City Hall branch, and I have to say, I appreciate the niche that this new chain fills. The food is of good quality (in my opinion), and personally, quite reasonably priced! Although I tried the pho at the other outlet, I'm not going to say that much about it here since that would technically be a different review. (I liked it though!)Instead, I had the 5 spice pork belly bahn mi. Considering (from what I've been told) that this chain is a sub-group of Annam, the Vietnamese restaurant by the Les Amis group, I was surprised it only cost me $5.90. I've had better bahn mis at a similar price point, and while they were a touch generous with the bread, I thought the flavours worked and the portion was alright for the amount I was paying. I would've liked more picked veggies, but I thought there was a good amount of pate, and personally enough pork belly too. Accompanied by an ice water, it was a quick, fast, and affordable meal that was precisely what I needed!",

I enjoyed the spring rolls. however the beef slice soup was a letdown. the beef slices were chewy and had sinew in them. we had also added beef balls (+$2.50 for 2). I didn't find the broth to be any better, as it left me feeling thirsty after the meal (use of MSG?) wouldn't really be an option to go back for a second time. but that's just my experience!",

Why? Anyways, after painfully jumping through lines and hopes and finally getting our order in. The wait to get the food was not too bad.

So I decided to go for the banh mi this time. Caramelised 5-spice pork belly ($6.90 ala carte)Toasted baguettes stuffed with savoury meats, topped with chicken pate, mayonnaise, hot chilli peppers, pickled carrots, daikon, cucumber and fresh cilantro.Quite a yummy combination with the tangy pickles, melt in the mouth fatty pork belly, and the creamy pate (I though it was tuna mayo at first as it was too creamy to the point of watery). Quite messy to eat with the pate dripping all over.Had it with a cup of hot Viet coffee with condensed milk. The drink was served in a metal cup which the older generation would had it associated with the poorer time. The coffee was a bit too bitter, but there was condensed milk on the counter to help oneself to. The drink tasted more better after that.Service was fast, may because there wasn't much people for a weekday morning.",

Seriously, when everyone around you sits down at 9:30am to eat pho, you'll get what I mean. I ate the rare beef and meatball pho, and the broth was super flavorful. They provide jars of fresh \"lemons\" (they look like miniature limes) on the tables. There are tons of seeds, so be sure to squeeze the lemons into your soup spoon to catch them. The amount of food was pretty decent. My breakfast deal included a drink (I chose a bottle of water) and was super affordable (about $6 USD). I wish I lived here.

    "text": "We wandered in, seduced by the well-constructed , vaguely oriental hipster decor, and the promise of a warm bowl of luscious rice noodle soup. I've never been to Vietnam, and can only say that Nam Nam have a fair account of the cuisine - their pho was tasty but lacking in top note aromatics e.g basil and coriander. The banh mi was heavy on the bun, but light on filling. That said, the addition of cream cheese to the lemongrass pork banh mi was a surprising touch, imparting a hint of musty sweetness to the sandwich. Drinks were served with a suspiciously generous bouquet of aromatics - lemongrass sticks, coriander, mint leaves etc. It took us a few minutes to discover the bamboo straw through which we were to slurp up the precious little liquid which the clump of aromatics helped to pad out. It might have some strange rustic aesthetic charm, but seriously folks - bamboo straw = bad idea. Lousy control over flow rate, liquid either fails to be drawn up the length of the straw or gushes into the mouth in a massive torrent. And don't get me started on how sanitary the bamboo straws are...However, what disappointed me the most about this outlet was the very surly (lack of) service. Forget smiling - I don't think a single word was spoken to us throughout the meal service. We were vaguely ushered in by a dour faced waitress, and then treated to an unending stream of silent wait staff shoving our orders at us. I've eaten at various other Nam Nam outlets in the past, encountering varying degrees of unfriendliness, but this one has to be the most unwelcoming. The fact that the owners went to great lengths to present a very attractive facade but no apparent effort into customer experience, shows that this place is all style and no substance.",

    "text": "Update: 29 August 2013I went back to Nam Nam recently and tried the Bahn Mi (grilled chicken with chicken pate). The bread was about the size of a sub, but it looked bigger and fluffier. Set against so much carb, the meat filling seemed pitiful. Bread : Meat ratio 3:1The bahn mi underwhelmed me. Maybe I did not order the correct filling. But the whole thing was fresh which was good, and for just $5.90 one should not complain as it did fill your belly nicely. Add $0.50 for take-away. I also tried the pho (beef slices) again and the restaurant people probably took note of feedback as the basil had disappeared! No more herbs in the soup though the soup was still tasty. I must say I prefer this version as I am no big fan of too much basil leaves in my pho.=======================================3 March 2013I am on the fence about the pho. It is actually pretty good except for the strong herbal (probably basil) tasting broth. The beef was not overcooked and the noodles were smooth and soft.I prefer the Canadian style where you are served a plate of sprouts, basil, lime and cut green chilies and you can customize it to your liking. At least Nam Nam has the hoisin sauce and chili sauce to make your own dip for the meat. Not many places provide that. \u00a0I would like to try the banh mi next time though. The place can get crowded during dinner time but the food is served pretty fast. It is probably not a place for you to linger over coffee during the peak meal times.",

My husband and I always see a good amount of patrons at this joint, so naturally our interest was piqued.My husband ordered the beef pho. I thought the broth was on point. However, we didn't like how they included the chili in the bowl. We would have rather had it on the side, so we could adjust the spiciness to our liking. Also, they didn't serve what we felt are the traditional garnishes: bean sprouts, basil, and lime. (Well, it did have lime, but only a small wedge was thrown in.)Next up was my banh mi. I ordered the first option, which is the 5 spice pork belly. At $5.90, it seems reasonably priced, as banh mi should be. However, the moment it was served to me, I had immediate buyer's remorse. The bread was way too thick. If you were serving me an Italian hero, it would've been perfect; but for banh mi, it's unacceptable. Second, the filling was very weak, with only 1 layer of meat and a paltry serving of pickled veggies and cilantro. The taste was there, but it was overpowered by the huge chunk of carbs in my mouth. Then, they had the nerve to charge us $1.60 each for small bottles of water, which are about the size of the Maggi seasoning bottle that they have on each table. To top it all off, their coffee machine wasn't working, so Vietnamese coffee was out of the question. And this is on a Sunday evening!This place had so much fail, I couldn't handle it. Next!",

    "text": "This place is just so darn cute!The kitchen staff wear I heart pho t-shirts with the singapore flag in the heart, they have signs showing how to get a table & order (pretty straight forward but it was quiet when I went, judging by previous reviews this isn't normally the case), and they even have little ceramic-y prison style cups to keep the ordering sheets and pencils in, even if the food was only so-so I'd go back just for the look of the place! I was very excited to be back on yelp soil, but not so much I couldn't stay away from more Bahn Mi! To be honest, I didn't expect a lot after spending the last couple of weeks in Vietnam, but boy was I wrong! I has the cold meat & p\u00e2t\u00e9 Bahn Mi without chilli (of course), and it was delicious! Ok, so not quite \"man up the end of the street from my hostel\" delicious, but as good as I've had outside of Vietnam! There was a slight kick to the flavoured mayo, but anyone with normal taste buds wouldn't have even noticed. I like the dim sum style fill in a form ordering, and you have to get your own utensils & napkins, but they still bring your dish to you. I also had a (small) bottle of water, and came to $7.50, which for what I've experienced in Singapore (outside of Chinatown) is pretty good You should check it out!",

    "text": "That's what happens to a decent chain having done well and expanded greedily ..... my last visit was a year ago and I was startled to witness how badly the food quality had deteriorated. The pho was hard and dry (either undercooked or raw material went out of control), beef slices and beef balls definitely over-cooked (being hard and dry). The broth was overly peppery. \u00a0Really do not know what had happened this evening. We were seated right next to the food service counter .... and horrified to see cleared dirty plates placed right next to cooked food which were awaiting delivery to the tables - all on the same counter top and next to each other!!!! A used dirty napkin that was atop a cleared plate flapped over a plate of fresh rice rolls that was awaiting delivery - and the service staff just removed the dirty napkin and matter-of-factly brought the tainted rolls out to the customer for consumption!!! Help!!!",

Why you put so much bread and so little inside meat and greens in your Banh mi. subway gives more toppings that you do, la. :DIf you look at Nam Nam's Banh Mi, 70-80% of the circumference of the Banh Mi is bread! Talk about cheap servings.The Pho. Well the pho is put in a bowl so small, it might as well come from a kids menu. Pho served in a huge white bowl! \u00a0the beef is good, but again the portion is small...Very disappointing, indeed...",

    "text": "These guys serve acceptable, occasionally even good and tasty food. But the Banh Mi's are mostly just bread - larger than life buns with measly little bits of filling. So the possibly nice flavors are lost. Try Viet Baguette - generous portions and better taste - \u00a0and you will never think of coming back here. \u00a0And some taste hidden in little morsels is no recompense for their idiocy - \"we don't serve water! Haha.\" Wake up - chasing away customers with your inanities and soon there will be another Name Name in the history book of closed restaurants. Hospitality business!! Haha.",

So for those reviews that say it's not authentic pho, what do they know? None of them are Vietnamese. \u00a0Chef is Vietnamese for one and we all know how much Vietnamese just LOVE cooking their food with MSG \u00a0(yes downside). \u00a0Well, since their pho is yum, I'll let it fly. \u00a0For drinks, skip the Vietnamese coffee, it's too watered down. \u00a0Get the coconut juice instead. \u00a0So yum!",

    "text": "After many failed attempts at eating here and turning away at the size of the queue, the moll and I headed in on a Sunday mid-afternoon. There was no queue and we get a table under the stairs. Spacious it's not, but we were not expecting acres of space and besides we were there for the food. We ordered pho bo, spicy chicken salad and the chicken and chicken pate banh mi. All of this washed down with hot vietnamese coffee with the sweetened condensed milk and two kinds of Vietnamese beer. The verdict? \u00a0Food was wonderful. Pho Bo had all of the right flavors although customizing with five different types of sauce on the table is easily done. The spicy chicken salad was great with just the right amount of spiciness and crunch in the salad. After tasting the delights of banh mi in Hanoi we waited to try it with some trepidation. We should not have worried. The bread was so crusty on the outside and melt away goodness on the inside that we could have eaten it on its own and enjoyed it. The chicken and chicken pate filling just added to the taste. The beers were good, the coffee strong and flavorful and it's a place we will return to again. Great value compared to comparable pricy Vietnamese restaurants and much better tasting than most. Thoroughly recommended.",

    "text": "Overall, I appreciate the setup of having customers put in their own orders, followed by table service, and I thought the atmosphere was pretty casual and light without being cheap. However, I wasn't a big fan of the pho or the bahn mi. I think the the restaurant just adds ingredients in proportions that are not appealing to my palette.The pho (I had the beef steak slices pho) looked to be about 60% noodles (which were a bit overcooked and mushy), 25% broth, 10% meat and 5% herbs; I prefer less noodles, and more meat and herbs. Additionally, the beef slices were not cooked-- which is a good thing (as the hot broth is supposed to do that for you), but they tasted too tough after they were only put into the broth for a minute. And the broth was sort of sweetish and sour-- vs. savory and brothy, which is my preference. Oh, and I also didn't like the fact that they automatically added chili slices to the soup (I'm not a chili fan and had to pull out each individual slice myself); I much prefer Vietnamese restaurants where you can customize your own intake of herbs.I liked the bahn mi more than the pho (I had the caramelized 5-spice pork belly and pate bahn mi), but once again, the proportions were off. The pork belly was tender and succulent, but all I could barely make out the pate and all I really tasted was the bread-- which was sort of fluffy and airy. And once again, they had chili in it, which I had to take out (although in this case, it probably would have dulled the bread taste somewhat).All of this said, there don't seem to be many good, affordable Vietnamese restaurants in Singapore-- so this is one of the better ones, but definitely not somewhere I'd frequent.",
