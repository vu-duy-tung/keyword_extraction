    "text": "A comfortable cafe with all the vibez on point. It has a rustic hippie feel with darker benches near the entrance and beautiful sunlight (perfect for that gram!) For the bar seats. While the atmosphere did not disappoint, their signature free the robot coffee did not impress. While the cold one had a decently even taste of coconut-reminding you of ondeh ondeh-throughout, the hot version was, as mentioned by another foodie, but a normal cuppa with a layer of coconut oil floating on top. What was bad was their vanilla coffee, which did not blend at all with their beans and left a rather pungent taste in the mouth. My food buddy even found a piece of paper in her drink, which was honestly unacceptable. What made the visit rather unpleasant was the staff which kept hovering around our seats and were swift to clear our cups even when the cafe was rather empty. That being said, credit must be given for their somewhat enthusiastic service. Overall, a place worth a visit. Whether it warrants a trip back depends on your personal preference! I'd say no for the coffee, but I haven't tried the food so that might make up for it. There's also a really cute dog named Baileys there on most days!",

It was also quite dim as there wasn't much lighting and what lighting that could have been used from the entryway, was covered by some kind of a wooden barrier with a peephole. Which I know looks cool from the outside, but is kind of annoying if you're inside trying to work or read and the light keeps disappearing because people are walking by...The french toast was so fluffy and tasty!!! Wish it was a bit more for the cost. The iced latte wasn't anything special, but good all the same. The gem I think is their fresh pressed juice! You can get a mix of any juice you want and it's served to you in your own little glass bottle!!All in all it's a decent place to go especially in Telok Ayer at lunch or for brunch when everywhere else is crowded. Also robots. I love robots. Robots all over. NEEDS MORE ROBOTS!!!!!!!",

Loving the nook they've created by blocking out most of the outside, so you feel like you're in a Melbourne alleyway. Tiny gripe is that with gst(?) my average latte from $5 came up to about $6.40. Pricey for 2 shots of coffee and some milk. I work around the area so that adds up pretty quickly.",

I can't say that I've ever tried that combo before in a coffee, and this one really worked well.I hosted a CMYE (community manager Yelp event) here and what I didn't realise was how small the space was. It's also very dark inside, as they purposefully cover the windows. It was very stuffy during our visit; even though they had air conditioners and fans running, I wasn't sure if they were actually working.Bottom line: Great place for takeaway coffee or for grabbing coffee with a friend... any more than 4 people would already be a crowd during peak hours!",

Bread and cakes are all homemade, down to the small English muffins. Small menu and portions on the petite side but the prices are noticeably less than others in the area.- Latte. Consistently well made and they do it better than another place I go to regularly (the Lokal), I think I had the woolloomooloo blend $5. Yes they do skinny or fat milk here. - Smoked salmon muffin, I didn't realise till it arrived that this was served on a homemade English muffin. Super yummy but I really need a bigger muffin to soak up that yoghurty sauce. $8- Sous vide egg is $3, add $2 for truffle oil and a piece of jamon with a tiny piece of toasted brioche. Again, the brioche needs to be upsized so do what I do and order their white bread for dipping ala kopitiam style. We loved the truffle version, truffle flavour was clear.- Toasted white bread - this is really good white bread and really toasted lightly with butter. They need to add some jam as a condiment for those who want it. $3 for 3 pieces- Tuna toastie $6 - same white bread, simple fillings but tasted quite fresh and not like how tuna can sometimes get a smell if opened too long.- fruitcake made by the owner's mom. He told me his mom is health conscious and he worried it wasn't sweet enough but for me this was perfect because it was light, fragranced delicately but clearly with spice and didn't have that greasy feel leaving your fingers all oily. Very moisty, I might have to go back to get a loaf. Loaf for $12 but you can get it per slice.I love the look of the place, the handpainted wall murals, little cubby hole window and the name Free the Robot. Yes, my robot definitely needs to be freed more often.At night this turns into the bar Bitter and Love so they close shop at 4:30pm.",

Also, take note of the quirky, hand-painted murals. There's so much to spot! \u00a0Visiting Robot is like hanging out in the home of your cool, arty, ultra-foodie friends.*Actually, Robot has the best cafe ambassador in the form of four-legged Baileys",
