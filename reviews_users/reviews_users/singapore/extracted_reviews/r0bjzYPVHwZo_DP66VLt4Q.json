    "text": "The best Spanish restaurant in Singapore by far! I highly recommend the chochinillo asada iberico aka baby pig. You have to order a day in advance for this dish, but it's well worth it. The skin is perfectly crispy and the meat juicy and succulent. Also tried the house and squid ink paella which were both absolutely delicious. Yes, it was indeed a feast! It's a quaint little spot with beautiful ambience so great for date nights! But it can get busy and reservations fill up fast, so just make sure you book in advance. I heard a new outlet opened in Boat Quay so will definitely drop by when Bukit Timah branch is fully booked. Highly recommended!!!",

Dough pastry fried, dusted with cinnamon sugar, warm chocolate and ice cream, almost ice milk with a hint of lemon. Service is attentive and thoughtful. When they delivered the churros dish with all the rest of the food, which I thought was a dessert, but realized was a brunch item, they promptly took it away when I asked for it to be served later. They then made fresh churros because the previous ones were no longer hot! Definitely worth more frequent visits.",

    "text": "Summary: This is the most authentic home-style Spanish restaurant I've had so far in Singapore. Food is fantastic, while price is reasonable (for SG!). Interiors are Spanish-homely and cosy. *Pros* are that the food is fantastic, reminds me of my trips to Seville and Madrid! Tapas are reasonably priced (for SG) and good with the flavour, not too salty. The jamon (Spanish ham) platter with five different selections was simply amazing. The main dishes are also pretty well done. The best thing we had that night were the Paellas: House and Squid Ink; Rice was well done (and made with real Spanish rice I might say!) and absorbed with the juices of the accompanying meats and seafood, which I feel thoroughly brings out the best medley in flavours. The party table beside us ordered a whole suckling pig (!), which I understand needed a prior 24 hours advance reservation. Oh yes, they also have a great Spanish wine selection, which I understand the owner imports the various variety by himself.*Cons* are that this place is not easy to book during the weekends, and service staff seems limited so they are always busy. I like that the manager and the chef do try to engage with the patrons when they have the free time. Nonetheless, the restaurant brings out the great charm and authenticity of real Spanish food, and the interiors are cosy and homely. The price is also pretty reasonable too, for Singapore. Would definitely go back for more! Recommended: Tortilla (egg and potato omelette), Jamon (Spanish ham) platter, chorizos (spicy sausages), albondigas (meat balls), pulpo (marinated octopus), gambas (prawn in spicy garlic sauce), clams and mussels, asparagus and garlic mushrooms, house paella (I hear the seafood paella is great too!). Yes - we had a party of six so we ordered quite a bit. Next time will try the suckling pig and the escargots!",

    "text": "A restaurant is defined by good food, good service, and a good ambience. \u00a0Unfortunately, My Little Spanish Place missed the mark on all 3 counts. \u00a0The food lacked salt and this is the first time I have had Spanish food that was under seasoned. \u00a0The service is quick, but relatively mindless. \u00a0They won't check up on you or act particularly hospitable. \u00a0The service and ambience were a combined point for us. \u00a0We had a baby and no reservations and inquired about a free table on a Sunday afternoon. \u00a0Although there were at least 3 empty tables indoors, we were told that we couldn't possibly finish in 30 minutes so we couldn't sit inside. \u00a0We finished in 30 minutes and I noticed that there was at least still one or two empty tables inside 45 minutes after we sat down. The restaurant was half full and seemed like a neighborhood spot. \u00a0But I can't imagine returning for the food here.The foodAlbondingas or meatballs are tender and come in a tomato based both though they were a bit bland. \u00a0Tortilla espanola or spanish omelet was well cooked with a sprinkle of parsley. \u00a0It wasn't oily and cooked well though it lacked some punch. \u00a0The pan/bread plate was a joke since it was S$6 for a plate of bread, olive oil, and garlic aioli. \u00a0The harmburguesas or sliders had a nice cheesy taste, but also lacked salt.The manager was saved from a verbal lashing from me only because my husband held me back. \u00a0I think that we were told to sit outside because of our baby and had a bad feeling from the start, but we stayed. \u00a0Now I can safely say, the food itself wasn't worth a visit. \u00a0Save yourself a trip here if you are looking for warm service and savory Spanish food.",

So I can only review this place with my limited knowledge of Spanish culture. I have on hand movie references and my Singaporean palette. I'm not a big fan of paella but I must say, I enjoyed this one! It's not too oily and every mouthful was tasty to the end. I like Sangrias and the ones they served here were yummy... come to think of it... I might just go there for the Red Wine Sangria. It tastes very much like a festive drink. I had some form of custard for dessert but i forget what it was called... just have the restaurant reccomend one to you! Loved the ambience and decor of the place. It was nice and quiet and i felt like I was on holiday there. Maybe it's because I went on a weekday, it was not crowded. Might be safer to make a reservation.",

And that impressive jamon bar.We ate:1) Joselito Guijuelo Iberico Bellota ($25 for 25gram serving): cured for a whopping 48 months, intense and decadent but so worth the cholesterol.2) Gambas al Ajillo ($16): fresh sweet shrimp sizzled with olive oil, fried garlic chips, and chilli pepper; that umami gravy was most sumptuous.3) Croquetas ($12): stuffed with jamon nubbins, cream, and mash; excellent on its own.4) Tortilla de Patata con Aioli ($10) - a thick, dense potato omelette layered with onions, and sided by aioli: passed muster, but was forgettable.5) Huevos Fritos con Chorizo y Patatas ($18) - fried eggs with chorizo and potatoes: What I expected was a breakfast hash of sorts, but this was really just a mish-mash of thick fried chips, fried chorizo dice, and a fried egg sunny side egg, strewn together. Rather disjointed and jarring",
