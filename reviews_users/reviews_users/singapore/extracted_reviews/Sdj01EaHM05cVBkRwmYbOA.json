If the heat outside is too much to bare, than the upstairs is where its at. take your shoes off and smoke some hookah inside. The drinks are nice and it's the only hookah joint I know that has Sam Adams lager beer. Another good thing about this place seems to be the location. It's close enough from the main area with all the hookah bars and restaurants, but because it's surrounded by shops that close early, people think that part of Haji Lane is dead. Little do they know this hidden gem. Haven't tried the food, but will definitely do so next time around.",

The live music that night was inconsistent- some songs were excellent, some were crucified. We were lucky to get an outdoor \u00a0seat. If you want one of the few coveted seats outside, come early. This place is located at the end of the street. I would come back.",

This place is truly magical in every important aspect you would want a chilled out cafe bar to be. Plus it has a whole spiritual element to it that makes it so unique and different to any other place i've ever been to. Great people all over this bar... not just working there, but the regulars that go to visit the place. The decor of the space is colorful unique and important. They play lovely world chillout music. So if you want to relax, take it easy, try something different... have a chakra lassi at Going Om. They serve them in 7 different colours as alcoholic or non - alcoholic beverages.They have an incredible goddess by the name of Tian who plays soothing feel good music with a ukulele on thursday nights. A charming unbeatable cafe on haji lane with infectiously enjoyable parties.",

    "text": "My favourite place to be in the Arab Street/Bali Lane area. The whole vibe is super chilled out and borderline hippie-ish, but a rastafari feel is prevalent as well. Think lots of plants, pretty lights and helpful but laid back service staff.My favourite place to sit is outside because it's great for people watching. They set up tables along the street (like most places in the district do) and you've got your choice of spots if you go early enough. What really adds to the laid back feel of Om is that there is no menu. This also ensures that the staff are knowledgeable enough to know everything on the menu, their prices and their discounts. And the prices are pretty cheap too: Beer (Asahi, Heinken, usual beer options) Liquor (Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum, Whiskey) + mixed (free)Cocktails ($12 onwards)Shisha ($25) If you head upstairs, and you'll have to take your shoes off, there's a cosy little attic which is really good for functions. Spread yourselves out on the floor amidst carpets and cushions, and order plenty of drinks - a bucket of beer is $40 which is great for a group or that one alcoholic friend we all have. Definitely one of the coolest places in Arab Street simply because it doesn't try.",

    "text": "This place was one of the first few Cafes that opened at Haji Lane - and it still has a nice buzz of people always hanging out, drinking, etc. The ambiance is very chill-out, and the place has a feel - with cushions on the floor, pictures and paintings on the wall, very friendly staff, and the guys that own this place, Barry & Oli are really nice and sweet guys.What I Love: There's always some activity going on, be it fire juggling, tarot card readings, musicians performing. There are small events, very underground and rave-like, that happen occasionally. The vibe's very underground, creative, artistic and hipster-ish. The second floor is my fave, basic & chill-out, great to hold tiny gatherings. Their food portions are pretty big and the wedges are yummmyyyyy.What I Don't Love: Their drinks. Their finger food is okay. But drinks-wise, stick to bottled or canned beverages.",

Compared to the other shisha joints such as Nasrin or Narbins, Going Om is so much more tastefully decorated, with their quirky prints and fascinating looking furniture. Apart from the typical shisha custom mixes such as Apple-Mint, Grape etc, they have a surprise in store for you. If you ask the staff nicely, they whip up a mean \"Vodka-infused\" shisha. Their shisha is smooth on the throat, and is one of the best I've had in Singapore. Ofcourse, comparing it to the shisha joints in Egypt will not be a fair comparison. Don't bother requesting for a menu, just ask the staff to recommend something for you. Their fried oyster mushroom nibblets were pretty good, and so are their wedges. They offer both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages too.",

    "text": "A hidden gem in the midst of our bustling city, Going Om is a Cafe Bar with great ambience and a heart - literally! A large, colourful heart is mounted on the hand-painted exterior of the two-storey refurbished shophouse, making it impossible to miss. In the day, it is a calm and peaceful oasis where lush, tropical plants and exotic eastern meditation music welcome weary shoppers seeking respite from the heat. Crystal healing, yoga classes, intuitive card readings and free meditation sessions are some of the unusual additional services offered here.At night, the place is transformed and the atmosphere is almost carnival. People from all walks of life converge here. There are live acoustic performances every night, and a roving magician makes an appearance to entertain and befuddle guests on Thursdays. A real treat is when the Starlight Alchemy movement artists make their weekly appearances. They perform with enchanting lights along the entire length and breadth of the narrow little street, delighting all the customers seated along the street. There is a large variety of flavoured tobacco for shisha, and you can request for custom mixes. However, I have not seen their innovative Watermelon Shisha anywhere else in Singapore. There is no menu here. While the usual western-styled food and bar snacks are available, the owners at Going Om also whip up their own original creations, so expect new dishes every time you head down. The staples fresh salads with homemade dressings and homemade desserts, such as the \"Strawberry Surprise\" and the \"Apple & Pear Crumble\", are popular dishes here.The Going Om Chakra drinks are also a must try here. The seven flavours correspond with the seven chakra or energy points in our bodies. They have both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions.",
