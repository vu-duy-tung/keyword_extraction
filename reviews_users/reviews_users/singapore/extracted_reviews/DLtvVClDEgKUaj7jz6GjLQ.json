We offered to wait for a table but it seemed that no amount of waiting would help as the tables were reserved for hotel guests who might saunter \u00a0down for tea. Make of this what you may but we surmised that Anti:dote does not welcome young mothers with babies, perhaps, for fear of despoiling their pristine and childless interior. The haughty hostess did not help. For this lack of hospitality, I would give Anti:dote a 0 star rating.",

I can see from other reviews that it is good for other stuff as well (breakfast, high tea etc) but this bar scores well for ambience, its drinks and attentive service. My girlfriend and I had the Lord Kane and Tea Time cocktails, which were relatively refreshing with a decent kick. Perhaps the only kink to mention would be the range of drinks available. If they had more choices, it would be perfect.",

We also ordered oysters, which were a steal (a dozen at $36 I think), though I do wish they had green tabasco. The oysters also came beautifully presented, which I really love.The convenient location in a hotel and the dark vibes at night make it a nice location for a date, as seen by a few canoodling couples on a Friday night. It does get busy at prime times, you may want to make a reservation.",

This review is for the evening bar, I've never experienced their seemingly popular high tea.I like to sit at the bar, which is beautifully lit and watch the bartender craft their cocktails. I have tried several cocktails from their menu but after a few visits I have decided that their Old Fashioned with Diplomatico rum is one of my favourite drinks ever.The oysters are decently priced (for a bar in Singapore) and are of good quality. Actually, most food on the menu is a very good match with their drinks. Another fave of mine are the cod croquettes and surprisingly I love the olives which come complimentary.Summarized: Atmosphere: A+, Service: A+, Drinks: A+, Food: A+Recommended!",

The atmosphere is louder than I prefer and the reason is probably because it's connected to the lobby and there's also a bar in the space but they separate out an area for the afternoon tea. Food-wise, I LOVED the egg appetizer with caviar and crab meat. The sandwiches were not quite as good, they were interesting but not the best tasting. The sweets were pretty good. Quite a few places have sweets that look amazing but don't taste the same. But this place is pretty good although they really emphasize one taste. For example if it's supposed to be tart, it's pretty tart. But overall it's a great value. \u00a0I made reservations pretty early on so timing was wide open.",

    "text": "At the lobby of Fairmont Singapore, there is this restaurant called Anti:dote well known for its bar. But do you know it also served tea set?The restaurant offers 2 types of tea sets : The Anti:dote Tea and The Oriental Tea which costs $45++, and comes with a choice of tea from a selection of TWG tea. Both tea sets are similar except that The Anti:dote Tea has The Anti:dote black truffle scrambled eggs, while The Oriental Tea serves a selection of steamed and fried Hong Kong Dim Sum. There is also Children Tea set ($15) but need to pre-order in advance.For tea,Tibetan Secret An exclusive green and black blendAs dramatic and uplifting as the Himalayan plains, this remarkable delicate TWG black tea is blended with sweet fruits and spicy overtones to soothe and revive the spirit.It tastes slightly gingery spicy.Holiday In ParisAn exclusive white blendRare Yin Zhen and sweet vanilla have been blended as an ode to a leisurely promenade along the cobblestone streets of Paris. Nard and wild flowers decorate this cup with their crisp, floral flavour and leave a heady, perfumed aftertaste.It tastes rather light with a slight flowery taste.For The Anti:dote Tea set,The Anti:dote black truffle scrambled eggs is served in black colored egg shell look alike cup, with soldiers by the side. The scrambled eggs smell of truffle and tastes creamy and rich.For The Oriental Tea set,There is pan fried carrot cake which looks slightly over fried as it is a bit too char. The inside is a bit too soft. There is also the fried shrimp fritter which is filled with juicy shrimps. Have it with the delicious chilli sauce.For steamed, there is Siew Mai topped with a piece of juicy scallop.The tea set is beautifully served in box with 3 layers of drawers with different items in each drawer.From the bottom drawer, there is Butter Cookies, Homemade Strawberry Jam, Devonshire Clotted Cream, and Lemon Curd. The butter cookie is melt in the mouth with a milk powder taste.In the middle drawer, there is the pipping Warm Raisin and Candied Ginger Scones. The ginger scone is not overpowered by the ginger, just a hint of it. It tastes very nice with just the rich clotted cream and slightly tangy lemon curd.In the top drawer, there is Smoked salmon, lemon and dill cream cheese, ikura roe,Boston lobster roll, confit lemon, chervil,Iberico ham quiche, mozzarella, black truffle,Confit duck rillette, foie gras terrine, pickled onions, and Coronation curried chicken, apple.Surprisingly my favourite item here turns out to be the plain looking quiche which quite a nice taste of the truffle.On top of the drawer, there is Strawberry gateau,Limoncino Napoleon,Cappuccino comtessa,Framboise lychee macaron,Red cherry rose ball,Karukera chocolate mirror tart,Chocolate pralines, andChocolate-dipped strawberry.Unlike the usual macarons with over the top sweetness, the one here is not too sweet with a melt in the mouth texture.Overall the tea set is quite tasty and pretty looking. The armchair is quite comfy and roomy. Service is not bad with the staffs checking on us from time to time. Remember to check out the unisex restroom before leaving. It has a rather interesting 2-in-1 Dyson tap. Besides being a tap, it's also a dryer.",

These drinks are made from artisanal pours of rum, vodka, rye whisky and gin balanced with fruits and spices, mostly of which from the hotel's own garden.Corpse Reviver #2 with level 4 potency and refreshingness. This would revive any corpse. A seemingly healthy drink with beet, rosemary, honey, lemon and tequila- Blood of Dillinger. There are about 24 items from the Tapas menu which is served till 10.30pm. We were fortunate to make the last order!The Crisp parmesan pizza ($12) is a must order at Anti:dote. This minute cracker is made of parmesan crust with dollops of flavorful pesto and powdered tomato as its based. Topping it off, you have the olive oil caviar, melty cheese snow and micro basil. Hearty pizza flavors in a small bite. Lovely! Crisp anchovy sticks with garlic aioli ($8) are the perfect snack to go with drinks and by that i mean cider but cocktails can do too! I love the salty and buttery puff sticks and also that strong and pungent garlic aioli.The Caramelised foie gras and vinegar glazed leeks on crisp puff pastry ($18) were little sweet morsels, kinda too sweet for my liking and there was quite a fair bit of leek/onion glaze. I could do with a slightly more seared/cooked foie gras but that's a personal preference.We could smell the Black Truffle Bao ($20) before we could see them. For a hotel bar, i must say the bao (Steamed Bun) skin was done very nicely and it had a nice fluffy bounce to it. It was nice seeing sliced Perigord black truffle but somehow the taste of the truffle didn't come through. Perhaps it was the strong flavors of the veal cheek and caramelized shallot with Madeira that overpowered it. The foie gras in the bao might as well have been a piece of tofu because it didn't give the bun any flavor at all. \u00a0We would have gone for more items if we weren't so stuffed. Other must tries are the 2-hour braised short rib ($18), clam sphere ($14) and the Paleta iberico de bellota done tomato shabu shabu style ($18).",

It is not that the service was bad, it's just that I am not a huge fan of these flash hotel bars - which is what this is. Fortunately it was one of the bars that Yelp recommended to me that was actually open, and I must say that the name intrigued me, but when I walked around the corner and discovered that it was a part of this really fancy hotel my eyes literally rolled. Still, it was my intention to step in here for a drink. The seating wasn't the best. Okay, they did have some lounge areas, and you can sit at the bar, but there were these other odd things that you sort of leaned against - I really don't like leaning against things when having a beer, I like to sit down. However, they had a pretty decent selection, not the usual stuff that you find at most bars, so I do give it points for that.",

    "text": "Disappointing. Visited from the US and was looking forward to a nice afternoon tea to end my Singapore trip. Staff was polite and courteous however service was non-existent. Staff seemed more connected to their mobiles rather than taking care of the guests. The tea was okay with no explanation from the staff when served. The white presentation box the savories came in was stained, torn, and looked old. Also, there were missing scones in the middle tray to which the server ran back to get from the kitchen. My guest and I also had to ask for all the condiments such as sugar and honey. Another problem was that there were no teaspoons with the silver ware. How could that be for afternoon tea? I expected more being that this restaurant serves The Fairmont brand of hotels. I hope they will train the staff for this tea service they claim to be unparalleled or take it out of their food offering because it truly is an embarrassment.",

    "text": "I went to Anti:dote with a group of 7 friends for drinks and dinner. For starters the atmosphere was really appealing: modern, with music but not too loud and friendly people having what looked like delicious bites.We ordered almost everything on the menu as everything sounded good but my favourite dishes where: Truffle Bao with veal cheek, jam and foie gras; Crispy parmesan pizza with tomato and garlic powder, pesto and caviar; Shigoku oysters; and caramelized foie grass with cabernet sauvignon vinegar.Everything was simply delicious and really, really savoury . The flavours of each dish were really intense and original, like nothing I had tried before.To top that off, the cocktails are on the same level as the food: quite awesome. My favourite one was the whiskey sour.That said, don't expect large portions of food. It's about quality and intensity, not quantity, but totally worth it.",

    "text": "The reviews for Anti:dote are confusing, as it appears that people are reviewing everything from breakfast to tea to cocktails. \u00a0So to be clear, my experience with the establishment has been solely as a guest of the bar, which has been superb on every visit. \u00a0Starting with the space, I love the modern d\u00e9cor and clear bar table. \u00a0The cocktail list is both creative and traditional, and even the traditional cocktails can have an interesting twist, like a spray of Chartreuse on the glass for the Tuxedo. \u00a0There is a very nice selection of Whiskey, not the most extensive but well-thought out. \u00a0After reading an article on the Whist cocktail in the New York Times, I requested one here, and the bar tender actually put together 3 versions using a different sweet vermouth, which was genius and also really showed what a difference one ingredient can make. \u00a0There are also some interesting tonics, which are made in house, but I tend to stick to old school drinks. \u00a0The food is also a nice surprise, being light and modern. \u00a0The parmesan pizza had a crust which was the parmesan, so it's basically a delicate frico with pesto and other toppings (careful - they break easily). \u00a0The octopus skewers were also very good, as was the aged iberico ham. \u00a0I have never stayed at the Fairmont here, but one does not need to be a guest to appreciate the quality of the drinks, food and service here.",

    "text": "This was my first high tea experience. Not the greatest service or friendly face at the entrance. Some of employees were genuinely nice, but the hostness or whoever seated us, not so much. Due to my Fairmont Gold status, I had $50 USD in credit that I was told I could use anywhere in the hotel restaurants and I was given a pretty hard time about being able to use it here. Three of us arrived at 3pm when high tea starts and were told they were already out of the Oriental Tea menu, meaning no dim sum appetizer. They wound up bringing one out, and two of the other sets. I'm not sure why the confusion, but I'm glad we got to try both. The dim sum was great as was the truffle scrambled egg, the finger foods pretty tasty, the tea was interesting and the desserts were not bad. I'm not sure I'd do it again considering it's somewhat spendy, but it's a fancy way to spend an afternoon in a upscale hotel in a nice part of town.",
