The caramelised onion quiche was well made and the greek salad fresh. The ploughman's sandwich was a real tummy filler, just like one would expect back in the UK!I would like to see this place stay as its a rather unusual location and relatively off the beaten track unless of course one lives nearby. I am only giving it 3 stars as it feels somewhat overpriced... clearly targetting the expat market.",

    "text": "This review is based off of their breakfast as I have not had a chance to try their dinner menu yet. \u00a0We have been here several times now and each time not just the food but also quality have been top notch. The lady who makes the lattes has some kind of magic touch. They are creamy, frothy and make us feel like we are somewhere in Europe. \u00a0We come with our one year old who can be a little rambunctious at times and everyone has a lot of patience, it's great. I usually opt for some kind of scrambled eggs while hubs gets the avocado toast. Eggs are softly cooked each time and the avocado is super fresh and exactly ripe. They also have a guest chef who prepares special items for brunch and dinner but we are always too early to try. I think one dish is huevos rancheros and it looked awesome. Oh and they also have the best music playing in the morning a little bit of new wave, disco and some funk. Definitely recommend it if you're in the area.Update:The last few visits have been off due to the service. There are some excellent people here but you're only as strong as your weakest link... Even my order for food was lackluster and I was really bummed that this is where we chose to have Mother's Day brunch. Unfortunately this place is just inconsistent. You're taking a risk if you dine here. Hopefully you'll go on a good day but I wouldn't choose this place if you're expecting anything special.",

When we arrived, we were greeted by Richard, the lovely owner. He was very chatty and made us laugh quite easily, so I had this feeling that a good experience was coming up.After perusing the menu, we called Richard over. I had questions about the juices, and he was very honest (\"Oh, the second one? That's just a fancy name for apple juice!\") I ended up choosing the Ruddy and Ready, which is their take on the classic ABC juice.I ordered the French toast upon the recommendation of Miguel, while he tried the special, which was an omelet with a local twist. I loved my French toast, as it was light, there was a generous side of maple syrup, and the portion was perfect for me. The berry compote really made the dish! Miguel's special was a well-executed savoury dish; good to know they can add in local flavours competently.As it's now 2015, I encourage everyone to stop by and check out what they're doing here. With Richard now managing the restaurant most of the time, the staff here is well trained and his presence just makes the place feel very neighbourhood-y and lovely. If you have the pleasure of meeting Richard when you visit, you'll know what I mean.",

    "text": "I'm seriously calling out all the Yelpers for their reviews of this restaurant. This brunch spot is downright AMAZING! From the food to the ambience to service. All great. The Breakfast menu is top-notch. The French Toast served with maple syrup & berry compote was Wow! I like my French Toast a little soft, likely due to slow cooking. However, this French toast was doused with egg cinnamon and dark sugar mix. Who knew French toast could be mixed with anything other than butter. The berry compote is a nice touch, adding that sweetness that so many of us crave in the morning. I know I mentioned that Suprette had an amazing French toast, Rabbit Carrot Gun just may be a little better! The other dish worth a try is the omelette with sugar cured prawns and topped with sweet Malaysian Sambal. The owner, Richard, dared me to try this dish and said to me that if I didn't like it, it would be on the house. Let's just say, I didn't get my money back. :D Kudos to Rabbit Carrot Gun for delivering a traditional western meal with an South East Asian twist! I'm dreaming of it already, as I write this review.My only knock on this restaurant was the flat white. It was just that, flat... There is some seriously some good competition nearby, ie Group Therapy Cafe etc, so I can't blame them. In terms of ambience, who can beat an open space on the corner of the bustling street of East Coast Road. Best of all, this spot has a neighborhood feel to it, which brings me back to my days of living in Brooklyn, NY. I would argue that this one shop turned the fortunes of Joo Chiat / Katong into the next new hip neighborhood. This resto oozes what this neighborhood can become.In terms of service, maybe I was a little spoiled since we were served by the gregarious and welcoming owner, Richard. However, I've been here once before on a weekday morning and thought the staff was courteous and prompt.Overall, one of my favorite brunch places on the Red Dot, if not my favorite. I can't speak on behalf of the other reviews, which were written eons ago, but this place has surely improved since those were written. Keep it up guys!",

For lack of a better description, both were distinctly average. The eggs were done alright but could have been fluffier.

No more lemak goodness *wipes tear*Anyhow. You know how when you hit up Boat Quay at night and will be left wondering if you've fallen into a rabbit hole and ended up down under? Or visit a hot pot restaurant and ended up at the birthplace of your forefathers? Similar experience here; only two tables of us natives and the rest a hodge podge of globalisation. We ordered up the lamb shank, sausages and a bottle of Odd Socks Shiraz-Cab-Merlot to share. Food was one dimensional and bland overall, and the lamb while tender, had barely any flavour to it. The sausage had tiny bits of apple, and the bubble and squeak that came with it had an interesting textureIf you're sitting inside, seating leaves much to be desired as tables are situated uncomfortably close to each other. It's a challenge to inhale deeply before squeezing past the neighbouring table, and you're always faced with the dilemma of whether to have your ass or crotch possibly brush against your neighbour's arm. Decisions, decisions. Product knowledge seems a little off. The lady on my left ordered a glass of red, the exact same blend as us. However, the waitstaff referred to it as Old Socks rather than Odd Socks, in that \"Ma'am did you order a glass of Old Socks?\" and \"Excuse me, here's your Old Socks.\" How do I know this? Blame it on the close proximity of the tables. The table on my right had a bit of a sticky situation when the couple's mains arrived before their side of wedges. The guy went ahead to devour his steak, which looked more like a skinny sirloin than 120 day grain fed rib eye, and the lady just didn't want to touch her chow till the spuds arrived. They arrived after having had to check with the waitstaff twice, by which time the dude was more than half done with his steak. How do I know this? Again, blame it on the close proximity of the tables. More of a miss than hit here, sorry.",

Sadly, the experience was disappointing. Despite a half empty cafe, food was served almost 30 minutes after coffee and juice arrived. The chalkboard advertised pork pie was minuscule and burnt -- the bottom crust was blackened and my knife couldn't cut through. The eggs Benedict was so-so, which didn't make the wait worthwhile. When I sent back the pork pie, the wait staff didn't seem surprised. As no one from the kitchen came to apologize, I decided not to accept a replacement and canceled the item. The disappointment spilled over to our general appetites and we decided not to finish the flat whites.",

Rabbit's unique name is actually inspired by our popular childhood game 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'!This caf\u00e9 is set up by Richard Huggins, former regional sales director of Microsoft Advertising and English chef Jane Glascow of The Pantry at Loewen Gardens. I highly recommend you to drive here as this place is quite inaccessible. Parking lots are available along Ceylon Road or Marshall Road. Forget about taking the MRT! The 'nearest' MRT Station (Dakota or Paya Lebar) would take you 25 minutes to walk!The entire place is very hip and informal. The interior is filled with black and white photographs and retro-looking artworks. Coupled by the antique furniture collection and 'traditional' floor tiles, it certainly felt quite homely.I visited this caf\u00e9 on a weekday afternoon and the place was very quiet and empty. What I disliked the most was the lack of air-conditioning. Since the caf\u00e9 is open to the street, it's quite hot and humid, especially in the afternoon. I felt that the seats were arranged too closely to each other, which made me feel uncomfortable.I later found out that their only business isn't just a caf\u00e9 - they also have beautifully re-furbished suites for travellers to stay in. Directly above the cafe lies the Rabbit Retreat - three luxuriously furnished rooms for travellers to explore a different side of Singapore.I find the food here very expensive. Appetizers can go up to $16.50! Besides, food takes forever to come. There were a total of 4 customers (including us) but it took almost 20 minutes for our pastas to arrive.My friend had their Prawn Aglio Olio ($16.90). Pasta and spinach tasted pretty good - it's chewy and not too salty. Also, prawns tasted very fresh.I went for the Beetroot Pasta ($16.90). It tasted sweet and goes really well with the lump of yogurt! The only drawback is that the portion is slightly small and to pay such a high price for it, not value for money!I would say Rabbit Carrot Gun is a decent place for catching up with friends over a good meal and for people watching. Service was pretty good. All of them were quite friendly and helpful. However, the high prices will surely deter me from coming back anytime soon!",

My husband ordered the sambal omelette, which was very tasty, but very small. I had the eggs benedict, not good. The food was very bland. There are so many great options nearby, RCG is something to skip.",

    "text": "Pretty quiet for a Sunday evening dinner much different from a Saturday lunch crowd that we saw. \u00a0By quiet I mean really quiet like 20 percent capacity. \u00a0Certainly no need for a reservation and I wonder why. \u00a0We sort of had cold feet on whether we should even bother going in and tempted do a burger two doors down but braved it anyway. \u00a0The food finally came...ordered the salmon, steak and the sausages. \u00a0Food was pretty good actually. \u00a0For starters they did not over cook the salmon. \u00a0The apple sausages were nice with just enough fat and pork. \u00a0The mash that came with the salmon and sausage was light and smooth. \u00a0They got a medium rare steak right too. \u00a0Only issue is on a value for money they get a 2 out of 5. \u00a0Certainly a salmon with mash and local naibi will not cost you $28 and another 10 bucks that be at fine dinning level main course. \u00a0That is a high profit margin there. \u00a0Ambience wise it was a little dimly lit and the Airconditioning has no effect. \u00a0I suppose if you want more customers they should brighten the place up perhaps able to attract more customers. \u00a0Overall service was not too bad just perhaps things are a little slower so they tend to be slower? \u00a0Has the apple crumple and toffe pudding. \u00a0Not bad but wish they got more ice cream. \u00a0Unfortunately the toffee pudding could not beat the one at pinique at taka.",
