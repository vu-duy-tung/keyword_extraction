Menu is not very friendly for people who are unfamiliar with Indian cuisine as there's no description to indicate what the dishes are. Thus we had to rely on google to try to understand. It's decent food and that's about it. Nothing fancy so don't expect too much.",

    "text": "If I could give this place -10stars I would . Without doubt the worst Saravanabhavan Restaurant I have been to . And I have been to their chain in a few countries . Firstly the staff are just lifeless . Secondly when I asked for palak paneer the staff offered makhani paneer and said same same . It wasn't . I know my Indian food. Stop trying to fool me.Thirdly , they gave us paneer fried rice when we ordered mushroom fried rice . Didn't even have the decency to say it was wrong . We started eating and wondered where the mushroom was . Could only see paneer. I asked \" Is this mushroom fried rice?\" Only then did the staff say \" this is paneer fried rice. Same same\". No it was NOT the same . Paneer isn't mushroom . They take ages to bring out the food . Should have gone to Gokul Vegetarian which a member of our party suggested. The only saving grace of this place was the Gobi Manchuria was good . Spend your money elsewhere . This place ain't worth it .",

    "text": "Saravana Bhavan is a famous chain of vegetarian south indian restaurants with branches all over the world. I've eaten at a few of them in Chennai, Delhi and the SF Bay Area. While some of them are really awesome, the others are a serious let down. This particular one falls somewhere in the middle for me. 3.5 stars to be exact (rounding up to 4 for the benefit of doubt). Their menu consists of the regular south indian fare - idlis, vadas, dosas, uthappams, rice dishes and thalis. I had the Ghee Roast Masala Dosa which tasted pretty good. Chutneys and sambhar were okay, but not fantastic. Like many places in Little India, Saravana Bhavan also doesn't have a good policy to handle crowds. Prepare to be ignored or wait indefinitely until a table opens up. But the thing I've come to realize is that the wait staff doesn't ignore you on purpose, it's just that they are understaffed and don't have good protocols for handling wait-queues. But apart from that, dependable south indian food that is a tad too pricey than what it should be.",

Tried again for the benefit of doubt in 2012 .. Nothing changed .. People still clamor to this place for its name.. It's just a shame that saravana in Singapore is last place I would consider..",
