    "text": "Guzman Y Gomez finally opens for business, in the west side of Singapore.During the opening, they gave out free burritos for an afternoon with a live mariachi band playing. The line was extremely long but moved rather quickly, I got my burrito in 20 minutes.It's similar to Chipotle, fast food tex-mexy type burritos and tacos. It's okay not mindblowing, but the good part is that they're consistent. (extra star for that) It's good now that they are in a convenient location outside the central business district (CBD).3-stars. Overall consistency and that free burrito bribed me into giving another 1-star.",

The pork and beans were just okay. Not too dry, but the flavors could be better. The rice definitely has room for improvement - it could use better spices.",

The burrito can be filling after a while so you might find it more enjoyable to have a small burrito and pair with sides like nachos. My friend opted for 2 quesadillas instead which looked rather small for a proper meal. My preference is the burrito bowl. The fish is surprisingly good- very fresh in big portions. The guacamole is also well prepared.",

    "text": "disclaimer: i am a big fan of chipotle mexican grill!the idea of having mexican food at a stone's throw away from my abode was so exhilarating! of course i have to give it a try asap and my first impression was, \"my! what a small shop front they have.\" their cashier counter was basically 3 steps away from the automatic glass door. the lady at the counter must have known it's not that easy to be staring at a steep menu board for long so she very quickly offered me the paper menu. I chose the spicy grilled steak with regular rice and a side of gucamole. she asked if i wanted sour cream. not being too keen about it, i replied, \"just a little.\" she said, \"sorry, we don't do just a little...it's additional 50 cents.\" that's when the first wave of missing Chipotle came crashing over me. i already accepted the fact I had to pay additional $2 for my guac and also they don't have corn as an ingredient in the bowl so I didn't think I want to splurge anymore for my $13 meal. Quickly i ended my order before i could do anything else stupid like ordering an additional side of churros with chocolate dip. My order was ready in less than 5 minutes and i was happy to find that they offer chipotle medium hot sauce at the condiment table; there were also sliced Jalape\u00f1o and diced red onion plus 2 other kind of sauces. It was a good 30 minutes before i could eat and the bowl stayed pretty warm in the eco friendly to-go container. Another nice touch was the melted cheese on the rice but the real saving grace was the hot sauce I picked up on the way out. the sauce really gave the other wise regular tasting bowl its kick. if you like black beans then you will be happy to know they are very generous with their beans. i ran out of rice faster than i could eat the beans. By now i am completely missing Chipotle like crazy.Thanks Guzman and Gomez for offering me a decent bowl of mexican food. it doesn't completely satisfy me but I am glad you are in my life for now.",

There is just so much flavour and spice in one bowl, which blended well together. Though the portion isn't huge, its enough to keep me satisfied. I'm glad that I'm able to find a similar version of Chipotle in Singapore!",

The burritos taste almost identical to Chipotle in the states, the tacos are really really good, and the quesadillas are delicious(my favorite). \u00a0You can also get jarritos(Mexican Soda) and a pretty good guacamole. If you're from cali or want some really good tacos/quesadillas I would definitely recommend this place. The burritos are just ok in my opinion(just like chipotle).",
