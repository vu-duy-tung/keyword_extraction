Efficient Yelpers are efficient!;) (of course there are a few exception :p) The seafood laksa cream I ordered was pretty good but wish that it had a bit of herbs or laksa leaves to taste. The seafood was fresh. It was a good balance of the laksa rempah and cream. The soup and garlic were average, didn't stand out.Pretty value for money when ordering the set meal (soup and drink, additional $3). I'd suggest to skip their desserts and head over to their neighbour Tom's Palette for good interesting ice cream. :)",

    "text": "I didn't know about this place until a fellow Yelper mentioned about it. As a busy person, I have no time to explore new places, and usually if I do, I spent my time overseas so since this came in my discussion with the other two Yelpers, we decided to try out this place. This cafe is located at Shaw Leisure Gallery - I have no idea of this location until that day and you can find it easily as it's located near the entrance. There were a few vacant tables so we were lucky to get a place. We ordered set meals which consists of a soup, drink and our main course. I had the Chicken Curry pasta and to be honest, it was average, I tasted better ones elsewhere. As for the soup and garlic, I didn't like it. So overall, I find this to be average, I can't give this more than 3 stars, I would give this 2 and a half stars if it's possible. As for the service, it was ok. Slow due to manpower shortage but the staff were polite. Overall, nothing to shout about.",

    "text": "Located at Shaw Towers, it is another food place you can drop by before heading to Tom's Palette. Came here with two Yelpers and we each ordered set A (drink + soup). The three interesting dishes' flavors on the menu are seafood laksa cream sauce, chicken java curry sauce and seafood thai cream sauce? (need to double check) and we have to choose the pasta types (Spaghetti, Linguine, Rotini). You could also choose the drinks (lemon tea, sodas, etc). After deciding on what each one of us wanted to try, we filled up our orders on a paper-based menu. The drinks came first then our foods and lastly our respective orders. Our orders came switched. I wanted to order rotini with seafood thai cream sauce but it ended up with linguine. Portion came bigger than expected for a reasonable price. Verdict, among the three dishes I tried, I enjoyed what I ordered more. The cream was lighter and it has the spicy and sour flavors in it. Overall, I am glad that one of the Yelper recommended this place. Affordable pricing and generous portion is getting rarer these days :)",

If you are wanting to try pastas with local flavours and wanna be adventurous, you gotta try this one! It serves creamy sauces and very satisfying pastas. It's seafood are also pretty fresh that's for sure! Soup and drinks are not worth mentioning. Service is slow at times but when you call out to them, they will attend to you, and maybe forget about you for a second time. No matter, the pasta is worth coming for. Prices are around 10bucks and they do not charge GST nor service charge. Yippee yay and you should try it!",

I have been patronizing this caf\u00e9 since 2008 and i would strongly recommend all pasta lovers to try their pasta selection.Their pasta selections ranges from the tomato based to the creamy based. I personally do not take cream and can't comment much on that. However, one seafood marinara is already enough to keep me coming back for years! The seafood that they use are all very fresh and includes salmon, scallops and mussel. Of course, choose your favourite pasta type to go with it. For me, I definitely love their linguini the most.The pricing of their menu is also considered value for money. They serve set lunches (which comes with a main dish, a bowl of delicious soup & a drink of your choice) at $10.50 and dinner (with an additional dessert) at $15.90. However, do avoid the busy lunch hours as you might have to wait 15-30mins to get a seat.",

    "text": "Shaw Towers seems to house a whole bunch of yummy secrets that I love discovering all at the same time! Creation Caf\u00e9 is right to the left of the building after entering from the main street, and sells creative concoctions of pastas with a dash of local flavors. My choice of pasta was the Laksa Linguine, which was amazing beyond words. Imagine the usual laksa sauce, except that it's ten times creamier and thicker, mixed with fat fresh prawns and poured over steaming soft pasta - carbs heaven! They also serve items like Tom Yum pasta, and Green Curry pasta, which are basically locally flavored sauces served with your choice of pasta. Both taste really good as well, and I've been back there several times to have each dish as my full meal rather than be satisfied with the spoonful stolen from friends. Service is quick and sincere since it seems to be run by a couple who actually owns the place, and parking is cheap too! One point that bugged me though, was how dimly lit the place was, but I guess its just d\u00e9cor and ambience preferences.",

Went many more times but lost touch after traveling lots: thought shaw was to quiet to survive, but heck we tried anyways. Happy to report the food it's just as great and the brownies heavenly still. Just a bit more pricey, but left us real happy: 4of us this time.",

Given the size of the shop and its popularity, there is always a queue. So be sure to be there early to avoid the working crowd. The setting of the caf\u00e9 is simple, but the pasta is beyond satisfactory and very affordable. Due to my preference for cream-based pastas, I tend to order the Seafood Linguine in Laksa Cream or Chicken Linguine in Java Curry most of the time. These 2 fusion pastas are incredible, the sauces are unique with blends of spices and cannot be found anywhere else. Imagine a thick and creamy laksa sauce over al dente linguine and that's what the laksa pasta is like - flavorful. They also toss in generous amounts of seafood like succulent prawns and squid. Similarly, the java curry linguine is to die for, with a thick creamy curry sauce with tender juicy chicken. You are allowed to choose which pasta you like - spaghetti, linguine, fusilli or penne - but I prefer linguine because there is more bite to it.The service is average, but there is always only 1 guy attending to the customers and he is always busy running around taking orders and serving food.",

    "text": "We came here seeking out the pasta, after deciding that Western for lunch was the agreeable to all. The set lunch cost about $10.90 each, and for starters we had corn soup with half a piece of bread. The soup was okay, and tasted like how any other instant soup would. For the main course, I had the Salmon Alfredo (Penne; other types of pasta are available) and was quite disappointed to see the few miserable pieces of salmon. However,the pasta was not difficult on the tastebuds, and overall it was a fairly good meal, even complete with a drink (ice lemon tea and many other flavours). We all agreed that we've had better, and probably would not head there again for a meal.",
