    "text": "How can you come allllll the way to Singapore and not stop somewhere to have the famed Hainanese chicken and rice? What sort of world traveler and food eater would I be?Even though I was in Singapore for less than 24 hours, I made it my mission to find SOMEWHERE that served this delectable treat. After asking around, I finally found a spot nearby. Unfortunately I had already stuffed my face with various other foods (dry noodles, stone pot steak, fresh blended juices, etc) literally minutes before finding this spot. The service was average, but the food came out swiftly. \u00a0I ordered the Hainanaese chicken which came with a soup and the delicious chicken broth rice. I originally thought it I would rate this a 3-star spot, but I decided that since I was stuffed to the brim already and was still able to eat all the chicken that it deserves 4 stars. That, or I'm a fatty with plenty of handles for the loving. Either way if I were back in town, I'd make the trip back since it has a convenient location and the food was good.",

The Hainan chicken in delicious!!The salty egg pork was also very good. Cereal prawns were average. As was the chilli crab. So yeh, stick to the meats, they taste better and are cheaper!",

I am sure the chicken was good, if not great, to most people but to me, it was simply just okay. \u00a0In addition, the place was packed which made it hard for us to put in orders with the waitress/waiters. Despite all of the above, it did feel like a hustling and bustling Chinese/hainanese restaurant and my stomach did feel satisfied after eating half a chicken. In terms of pricing, everything was in the mid-tier. Nothing too expensive or cheap. Their drinks are pretty good and adequately priced.",

What I learned over the years is every chicken rice taste slightly different. It's like each place have own recipe. Their chicken is one of the best I had. I really liked their fragranced rice. I could eat just rice alone.We ordered both roasted and steam chicken. Roasted was crispy outside and both were really juicy. I enjoyed with thick soy sauce, chili paste and ginger mixed sauce. Broth soup served with the rush had a very nice flavor, I was still feeling hangover from previous night, this broth was so comforting to my tummy, I felt so much better after lunch.Tow Miao vegetables was cooked with great flavor. It was so tasty and went well with the rice, I almost thought about asking for the second plate of rice.Come early, preferably by 11:30am to avoid crowds. They were packed with customers by 12:10pm.",

    "text": "If I could give zero stars, I would. Horror story begins now. Marina square outlet. Shop 1/4 filled. We came as a group of 15. They merged two tables for 12 pax. I asked if we could add one more table on the side. They said it was the manager we arrange this. I insisted that it's not logical to force 15pax in a 12 pax table. It's not one more but 3more. I let it go since everyone was in a good mood today. Waitress went to speak to another colleague who appeared to have more authority. But what she said next took away my hunger for that night. No joke. I literally stopped feeling hungry. First time in my life. \"If you want lor. I can join this table lor. If you want.\" Using two fingers and a thumb to hold a 30kg table. That's how much she really wants to do it. I replied. It's okay. Let's leave it. We ordered so much that the table had no space and all these while. The two large tables beside us only sat two pax. As if it could piss me off further. Bloody table with two pax who ordered two plates of chicken rice. The other areas of the restaurant was still only half filled. The Chilli crab is crap. Best of all, the very person who mess up this experience with them. Left for home carrying his bag at 7:30pm. Which restaurant manager leaves his shop at peak hour of the operations???? My first time going to Wee Nam Kee or whatever the name it is. The rest is history.",

First it's just chicken in an average sauce and then rice on the side. The chicken is cold (which is ridiculous); I also had BBQ pork which was cold. I asked the seater if it should be cold and he said yes. So, if you are hankering for a great Singapore dish-skip this one and go for something else. It is unimpressive and overrated. Sorry.",
