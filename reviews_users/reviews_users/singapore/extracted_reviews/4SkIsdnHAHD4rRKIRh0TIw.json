    "text": "I was hesitant about this place even though I always wanted to try it. I have heard mixed reviews. Some raves and some rants. In any case we managed to get a table without much wait despite it being peak dinner time on Saturday night. Maybe it helped to be just two persons, and not a big group. While we were there, we saw a constant line of people waiting outside for a table right till 9+ pm. A brisk night it was. The servers (only 2 or 3?) were swamped and looked ready to drop. So do cut them some slack, if they are a bit slow.It is a family friendly place and we do see many families having their dinners. We placed our order and waited. The side dish - cinnamon apple wings - came first. Followed by the ratatouille. Then it stopped. They forgot the rest of our order. The half chicken in caramelized apple sauce and mashed potato came pretty fast after we asked about it. The half chicken was a decent size and could feed two nicely, or one extremely hungry diner. The chicken was tender and moist, a bit salty. It felt like the chicken was kept in a steamer or bath after being roasted, to get that wet feel and not a totally dry roasted chicken taste. The sauce was ok, salty and sweet. The ratatouille was surprisingly good. I was surprised to see it oven dry, and less stew like. But the taste packed a punch and I liked it. The winner was the mashed potato. It was so creamy and gorgeous. My friend said it was very similar to the one served at Joel Robuchon restaurant. I could die happy just eating this. Definitely unexpected in a place like this. The cinnamon apple wings were average, and that would be very kind. It lacked much taste in both cinnamon and apple. The crumb batter was also tasteless and the chicken tasted like it was from frozen stock. Tasteless too. I would go back again for just the chicken roti, mashed potato and ratatouille.",

    "text": "As a foodie, I heard about this place from my friends but finally saw one of the chains at Great World City. Ambience wise, it is cosy and open air concept which made it inviting especially when it is located at the second floor. I like the interior design outlook. Reminds me of the European food talk shows on the television.Was seated quite quickly as I came in around 5.30pm on a Thursday. Ordered the chicken roti and it was yummy. The pricing was a bit on the steeper end but less than $20 with tax for a French main dish was worth it. The chicken was well baked and the mushroom with creamy sauce makes it perfect. Went off and then came back to try their limited offer for the peach baked good. It wasn't really recommendable but you can try it out. Might try the tiramisu on the next visit :) Overall, I am impressed with what this restaurant does and will be back for more!",

Unfortunately this didnt really stand out. \u00a0The atmosphere is what you'd expect. Mall crowd, people shopping, pretty much zero ambiance. \u00a0I cant really hold that against them since its in the middle of great world city. I didnt come here trying to impress anyone. \u00a0With all the items we tried the only thing I really enjoyed was the creamy wine sauce on the chicken. \u00a0The french onion soup was blah! Where's the cheese? And I HATE french onion soup that just comes with a few croutons thrown in. \u00a0I cant pretend to be a fan of escargot so cant really comment but the sauce had tomato sauce in it which isnt really authentic. And since its called POULET I figured they would have some more interesting chicken dishes but I think I counted two on the menu. Its just roasted chicken in a tasty sauce. Good sauce but boring chicken. The service was typical. Not bad but not great either. \u00a0I dont think I will be back.",

This place served me two balls in a bowl of mush posed as a plate of profiteroles. Seriously?! The ice cream and chocolate sauce was melted. Where was the profiterole? Drenched in a mush of sauce. That being said, the roast chicken was done nicely. Meat slid of the bone. Mushroom starter was impressive with that dancing poached egg. French onion soup was alright. Nothing special.Service is prompt, polite and its rather cool to watch the head chef calling out orders and watching how the kitchen worked. But as a dessert person, that mess did Poulet in for me. Sorry guys.",

    "text": "I've been to Poulet three times now, and I think I can safely say that dining here is definitely a two-star experience. You might be inclined to give it 3 I suppose, if you like faux French cuisine that's a little bit overpriced. It's a specific type of craving, and I wouldn't be surprised if Poulet survives for a while despite the mediocre offerings.I've tried the star of the menu, the rotisserie chicken, and it's at best a 3 star item. It's... oddly sweet, and while the mushroom cream sauce is delicious, it's incredibly cloying. This leaves you stuck. The chicken isn't much without the sauce, but too much sauce and you feel a little full. Other items I've tried: the braised duck. Gravy's tasty, duck's pretty tender, but it's served with practically nothing. Two onions and a chunk of carrot are more an after thought than real accompaniments. The pork belly came with cold mashed potatoes and a sprinkling of baby spinach leaves. The pork was... moderately tender. Not quite melt-in-your-mouth tender, but fatty and decently cooked.The mushroom and potato soup is creamy and actually quite good, while the French onion soup is a touch too sweet. The mushroom vol-au-vent is... just what it's described as. Nothing more nothing less. If anything, it was unbelievably mediocre.I will say that their escargot are fairly unique. Instead of the usual garlic butter, it's in a tomato fondue with almond butter. It's a nice change and the tomato provides a good contrast to the butter and oil. I'll end off with desserts. The tiramisu? Average. Not horrible, but nothing to write home about. The lychee panna cotta? Interesting, and worth trying, but hardly the sort of dessert to make a trip for. The banana bread and butter pudding was piping hot, and definitely tasted of fresh bananas, so I suppose if you have a bread and butter craving it's worth a look-see. So I'm sure you can tell what I think of this place. Decidedly average and frankly quite underwhelming. Why have I been there thrice? Once was to try it myself, second time was to let my mother try it, and the third time was because my brother wanted to try it. I'm just relieved that everyone at home has tried it now... so I don't have to go back again.",

The banana bread pudding looked good too but was rather small!All in all a decent place, I liked that because it's not halal, the manager allowed my Muslim friend to bring in food from elsewhere while the rest of us ordered from there. Some restaurants are pretty inflexible about these things so I like that there was some common sense at work here.",
