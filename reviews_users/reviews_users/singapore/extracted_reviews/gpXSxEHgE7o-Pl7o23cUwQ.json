    "text": "Reviews of this place from 2012 are pretty terrible, and justifiably so - at that time you got what you paid for.Yet, around 2014 I observed a significant rise in the quality of food served by Nihon Mura.Sure, the price has gone up from $0.99/$1.19 per plate to $1.60 per plate, but the food quality has also improved significantly.Naturally, this being a budget joint the quality of the food doesn't compare to premium sushi outlets. That said, what you get for $1.60 is pretty fresh and tasty. Take the inari sushi for instance (rice inside a sweet beancurd pocket) - many places in Singapore have dry inari sushi. This place is one of the better ones, with the beancurd pocket quite moist and reasonably tasty, and the rice inside being similarly moist. Their other items are generally pretty good too - the lobster salad items, for example, have a decent amount of lobster which isn't shredded too thinly, and feels reasonably fresh (i.e. firm).A natural comparison would be with Sushi Express, where a plate goes for $1.50. While the quality of Sushi Express is reasonable, the main downside of eating there is that you can't order what you want - you just have to pray that your desired dish is on the conveyor belt. At Nihon Mura, though, you can order whatever you want on the iPad mounted beside your seat. There is even a search feature for you to look for dishes by name.Which brings me to the bad thing about this place: the service. We ordered a few dishes at the start of the meal and they only came at the end after we had reminded them. That was after at least an hour. The service on other occasions when I've been here has been similarly lacking.That said this is still a good place to eat unless your budget is not an issue.",

    "text": "This place is located on the basement floor of the Cathay Cineleisure Orchard building. After watching Deadpool, I wanted to get a snack. This place was conveniently a few floors below, so we decided to give it a try.Each table has an ipad, similar to Genki sushi. We placed two orders right away. 15-20 minutes passed and our food still did not come. We had to flag down a waitress (because they were all busy chit chatting with each other instead of going around checking whether or not the tables needed service) and she told us that both orders never went through. We ended up having to place the order again, manually. I noticed that the food that we ordered was way fresher than the food that came off the conveyor belt, which makes me wonder how long the plates have been sitting there.In my opinion, this place does not compare to Sushi Express, which is just a block away. Its $0.10 more per plate, they make you pay for your tea, less variety of food, and bad service. This place has potential, but they really need to work on improving it.",

    "text": "Hmm mixed feelings. Is this place better than sushi express ? It does have more choices or different choices. Quality is about the same. 1.60 vs 1.50. Venue is more booths rather than sitting a belt. So this place you could get your food faster than sushi express because you are iPad ordering it rather than fighting others for a dish. The service is really poor here. Overall I would say sushi express is a notch better in the dining experience. Would I come back? Not so sure.",

    "text": "Stopped here for a quick lunch. They had quite a bit of variety and the iPad ordering system was pretty handy. The conveyer belt with different plates in the center of the seating area was pretty neat, but did make me a little worried about refrigeration of the food we were about to consume. Everything was tasty, but nothing special. Heads up - they don't have water here and you'll have to go to another vendor in the mall to get it. Happy hunting!",

It took maybe 2 minutes at most till the waitress came to Serve us our food. Sadly, they no longer have shishamo or the pregnant fish on their menu. It was my favorite .",

    "text": "I'm a regular patron of this sushi buffet restaurant, if only because of its very affordable price. Nihon Mura's probably one of the cheapest place where one can get his/her sashimi fix. First of all, the service is hit or miss. It might take more than a minute to get the waitresses' attention, and they do mess up your order once in a while. The sashimi's average at best, but I do feel that the quality and freshness justifies the price. At least the salmon sashimi is fresh enough. Nihon Mura also serves fried stuff such as Torii Karaage (fried chicken), which I found to be rather tasty. I liked the Shishamo (pregnant fish) quite a lot as well, but be warned that the quality varies. All in all, this is a value-for-money restaurant; just don't expect too much out of it. If you're looking for good quality sashimi, expect to spend at least 50% at places such as Hanabi or Ikoi.",

    "text": "Although Nihon Mura advertises for 99 cents sushi (one of the cheapest, if not, cheapest in town), they have a huge lack of quality, variety in food as well as exceptionally slow service by their waiters.Meeting at Cathay for a school reunion dinner, my classmates decided to give Nihon Mura a try. Not only did we wait for 20 minutes before receiving our seats, the waiter just left us at the table after bringing us there. I found that they did not have a wider variety of Japanese food. Mostly sushi and Japanese grills. Aside from sushi, the other foods were significantly more expensive. In the end, I ended up having a few pieces of their 99c sushi which were not sufficiently filling but I had a bill of $7 in the end. Definitely not worth it to have a meal at Nihon Mura.",
