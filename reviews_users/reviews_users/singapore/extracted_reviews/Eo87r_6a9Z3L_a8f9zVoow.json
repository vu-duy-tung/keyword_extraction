To my understanding, they rotate their taps and food items on the menu. I ordered the marinara cheese sticks. The bread was a bit soggy, but I did like their marinara sauce. It was a bit spicy, yet sweet. I would return again, but just for drinks.",

Consequently, the beer list was not at all well rounded, only focused on two styles. Highly disappointing!Besides that, the atmosphere is great. Most beers are around \u00a015-18, a bit more expensive then other beer bars in the city; however, sours also cost more. Would love to see more IPAS next time.",

They constantly introduce new beers, as long as one runs out, they'll replace it with something interesting. As a result, there are times when the menu is friendly to certain taste preferences, and others when you struggle to find something to drink.You can ask to taste anything before you order and their staff are very knowledgeable! I usually let them know what kind of beer I like and they'll recommend something that is close to the flavor profile you've described.The first time I came here, I had really awesome beer that was light, fruity and delicious. The second time I came, they only had rather tart beers - like one that tasted like pickles, another that was lemon, and one with sour cherries.

The place is tiny, has bad air-conditioning, and the size just makes sound reverberate in a really bad way.Came here on a Friday night and it was so loud we had to shout, and when you're paying $8 a glass for beer, it ought to be COLD. Within 5 minutes, my beer tasted like warm piss. I don't care where this beer was brewed, I don't care whether it is ale or pilsner or whatever, I do care about the temperature of my beer. Something needs to be done about the storage capabilities of this place. Mid-priced warm beer coming out of the wall in some location not really near an MRT? Errrr okay.I did take a look at their snacks menu - looks promising and very local, but I didn't try. Also, they don't allow you to taste test anything, with some clueless and overworked waitstaff at the cashier to collect your money and vaguely recommend you a brew. This place would be good if they allowed a shotglass tasting of all the beers they have on tap for an amount, say $20, maybe someone can suggest this to their owner.P.S. Amex not accepted",

    "text": "Ok, I think Singapore may not be totally ready for Druggists. \u00a0The fine folks at The Drinking Partners (thedrinkingpartners.com) decided to come up with The Great Beer Experiment and got some good buzz from beer enthusiasts that made the trek all the way out to Pasarbella at The Grandstand. \u00a0 \u00a0So, toes dipped and the water temperature promising, putting the whole foot in involved launching Druggist in Tyrwhitt Road, where the gestalt is decidedly more hipster, low rent enough not to go the whole hipster hog (just opposite Jalan Besar Stadium) and not totally slumming it at a hawker center. \u00a0The evening traffic, IS hipster, or so I've been told by the beertenders. \u00a0I've never hung around long enough to find out for myself, opting to scurry away before the sun climbs below the multi-story carpark at Jalan Besar Sports Complex across the street, like a Carpathian hay farmer fleeing the lengthening shadows. \u00a0So I'm really glad for the Drinking Partners that they had the stones to put Druggist out there, but that's just me, the beer nerd talking. \u00a0If it'll help, they have my undying loyalty and oh, here's a virtual string of garlic and a wooden stake from Crate and Barrel carved with calculated indifference...the only thing to put the hipster undead down for good, or maybe put Tactical Nuclear Penguin on the menu.Man shall not live by bread alone and beer businesses shall not live by beer nerds alone. \u00a0We may love and understand everything you do, but we also understand that you cannot pay the rent and all those enthusiastic young people on beer nerd custom alone. \u00a0You have to do the hard thing which, the almost impossible thing, which is to \"educate the customer\". \u00a0No scarier words have rung in the ears of those who dabble in the dark art of F&B. \u00a0My hat's off to Lincoln and the Drinking Partners!!So here are my recommendations for Druggist:Beer Nerds. \u00a0Show up early. \u00a0Preferably when they open. \u00a0Keep asking for the tasting flights which should have been launched by now. \u00a0Early is good since you have the place to yourself and you get to properly taste the wonderful rotating kegs (new kegs come in every Tuesday) in peace without being distracted by the bone chilling miasma of indifferent cool. \u00a0 You get a bit more individual attention from whomever is tapping that day as well if you need to find out a little more about each tap.Ratebeer. \u00a0Whip out that smartphone, type Ratebeer into the search bar. \u00a0Get very useful rating information plus an invaluable guide to what to expect. \u00a0 None of the Druggists offerings are below a 90 rating. Useful supplement to whatever the staff at Druggists are already telling you about what's behind each tap. \u00a0You get information on what other beer nerds from around the world are saying about this very beer that has your eye.Parking. \u00a0Multistory carpark across the street. \u00a0Basement parking also available at Jalan Besar Stadium, but a little creepy, but for me nothing compared to the threat of being mobbed by hipsters. \u00a0Street parking if you're early.Flights. \u00a0I wish they had them, but I just do my own when at Druggist. \u00a0So you don't rapidly reach a point of diminishing returns, you ask for about 100ml in each glass \u00a0taste it and then move on. \u00a0You end up paying for the full glass, but you don't waste good beer and you don't get wasted and you get to be a better person for having a more experienced palate for beer! \u00a0Still waaaaay less expensive than tasting single malts...Ok, to close, here's the sermon. \u00a0Beer in Singapore is close to where coffee is, a budding culture backed by people with a passion for their product, armed only with what little capital they have and a fierce belief that Singaporeans are ready to dig deeper and to understand the origins of beer, appreciate its traditions and explore the cutting edge of where global beer culture is headed. \u00a0I think we're getting there. \u00a0There is a nucleus of enthusiasts and a general open-mindedness about spending a little more to try something new, to explore outside the conventional, the commercial and the safe. \u00a0Maybe, just maybe that rich amber brew with the off tan head bearing that slightly funky fog of sweat sock going at $17 a glass might be a life changing experience, an epiphany. \u00a0The fine folk at Druggists are betting the farm that Singaporeans are willing to take that gamble and I for one am hoping fervently that my fellow Singaporeans are ready to roll the dice!",

    "text": "They have 24 kinds of beer. Tried a few of them. Taste was unique, non-traditional, I would say, and was not for me. I like more traditional German or Belgium beer. They only have a few kinds of finger bites menu to eat. Beer \"full size\" was in large red wine glass (probably 350ml) and charged $15 to 17.",
