We got to try two of the three flavors and both broths were heavy with rich tonkotsu flavor. \u00a0I liked my spicy red tonkotsu broth - the flavors here were mildly reminiscent of Szechuan flavors with its red oil (though not the same type of ma la flavor). \u00a0 You can request fresh sesame seeds to grind in to your broth. \u00a0Top this off with free hard boiled eggs and bean sprouts and you leave a very happy diner.Be warned that you may have to wait during peak lunch and dinner times and literally rub elbows with your fellow patrons. \u00a0But you will be happily slurping away when you get your ramen. \u00a0Slurp on with the king!",

    "text": "Truly the King of the Japanese Ramen BrothDo you know that there are two Keisuke shops in Singapore - Keisuke Tokyo Ramen at Millenia Walk and Keisuke Tonkotsu King at Orchid Hotel?Keisuke Takeda is precisely known for his creation of very unusual soup bases cooked with prawns and crabs, not the usual classic soup bases like shio, miso or shoyu. Ironically, Keisuke Ramen in Singapore which initially started selling only the very unique prawn based flavour, switched to selling the usual after customers' feedback. Keisuke Tonkotsu King, the little ramen shop at Tanjong Pagar, goes back to the basics. There is always a queue here, for the reasons that the ramen is really quite authentically delicious, and the shop can only sit about twenty. You can choose between the basic Tonkotsu Ramen ($10.80), Black Spicy ($11.80) or Red Spicy ($11.80). I would suggest a Tonkotsu Ramen Special All Toppings ($14.80), and you can also indicate if you want your soup to be light, normal or strong.While I may have preferred the noodles over at Ippudo or Marutama, the char siew at Santouka, and the tamago at Miharu, the Tonkotsu soup at Keisuke is the best - thick, milky, tasteful, flavoursome and slightly salty. I finished till the last drop. The soup wins, hands down (you may still argue it is too salty).",

The great thing is the ability to customise your order - you can choose hard noodles, soft noodles; how rich you want your stock to be; the amount of chicken oil; etc. And it comes in three variants - the usual tonkotsu broth, the tonkotsu broth with red chilli oil, and the tonkotsu broth with black garlic oil. All of them are good, but just different. The normal tonkotsu is just so porky and intense. The black version features black peppercorns for a spicy kick and for contrast with the porky broth. The red version is just as delicious, rather intense in its spiciness. And the eggs are done perfectly. There's also free beansprouts and eggs to munch while you're waiting which thankfully isn't long - once you get in! Just love this place - just don't like the long queue![My ratings are determined by the class of goods / services provided i.e. 5 stars represents the best in the industry for that particular class of goods / services; 4 stars represents excellent; 3 stars represents OK...and so on]",

The menu is simple enough -- you make your selection on a piece of paper with check boxes: spicy \u00a0vs non-spicy ramen, noodle firmness, chicken oil amount, and broth strength. I went with a non-spicy tonkotsu ramen with all normal selections for $10.80 plus service charge & tax. The best part was you get some sesame to grind and pour into your ramen, and you also got free unlimited hard-boiled eggs & bean sprouts on the table! The queue is usually quite long during lunch hour because it's quite a small place inside, but my coworker and I went on a semi-rainy Friday 1pm and we happened to catch a window when there was basically no queue.I'm glad I have another good ramen lunch option around the Tanjong Pagar area!",

If you need more flavour, there are additional seasonings on the table. OMNOMNOM",

I would not recommend for a big group to eat here, they'd be able to fit parties of 2-4 easily and quickly, but any more and you might find yourself having to split up/wait for a long time.Price is fair and you get to customise your ramen based on how much oil you'd like in the broth, type and strength of the broth, hardness of the noodles and whether you'd like seaweed or flavoured egg to go with, or both. In the name of efficiency, you mark your preferences on a sheet while standing in line so your order gets sent to the kitchen when you reach the front of the queue.There is a barrel of cool (barley?) tea next the entrance for hungry/thirsty contenders in the line - a nice little gesture like this is always appreciated.Once inside, there is plenty to occupy you while you wait for your steaming bowl (which doesn't take very long): conscientiously grind sesame, peel your own hard boiled eggs, or nibble on pickled bean sprouts.I love that it feels a little like I'm eating in a hole-in-wall noodle shop in Japan when I'm at Tonkotsu. I always get the black pepper bowl, it's a good quick fix for when Ippudo just seems too far away and too long a wait.",

At 1st I thought that it's just another ramen place which open during this recent Japanese food invasion in Singapore. After reading the reviews here, I decided to go during off hours to avoid any lines. The place is sooo tiny, no wonder there's always a line if it gets busy just a bit more. You'll be given a paper to construct your ramen: how thick you want the soup, how springy you want the noodle, onion or not, egg or not, pork or not, and also different kind of ramen (regular, black spicy, and red spicy). I chose the complete regular with normal soup and firmness. The soup is pretty thick with visible fat floating around (this is a good thing for me!) even for the normal, the seaweed is in the shape of big rectangular cut peaking above the bowl, the egg is runny once you break the white part, and the ramen is springy! If you think you want more ramen, tell the waiter before you finish the soup - there's an explanation on the wall about this. Pretty shiok ramen from this small place on a non-touristy area.",

We were here right at 6pm when they opened and we managed to walk in straight away. \u00a0But the tiny space filled up almost immediately even before our noodles are served.Free flow of hard-boiled eggs, bean sprouts at each table is a nice touch. But note that you do get a perfect onsen egg in your ramen, so I would advise against bring too greedy with the free eggs.Ramen - I prefer the original to the black broth. The black version has a spiciness that reminds me of Sichuan spice and I feel that it took away the sweetness of the amazing tonkotsu broth. I would only go for the original next time.The pork slice is nothing compared to santouka. I didn't finish mine.Order original with extra firm noodles and less oil, that is my perfect bowl of ramen.Plus...thank you yelp for finally allowing reviews to be posted via mobile app!",

    "text": "This outlet of Keisuke specializes in Tonkotsu Ramen, which is made from a rich milky pork broth. Keeping things simple, they have 3 flavors to pick from- Original, Black Spicy and Red Spicy. Black Spicy is a pepper based spice while Red Spicy is a fresh chili paste.The first thing i heard about Keisuke was their free flow boiled eggs and seasoned bean sprouts. That kinda contributed to the long queue i guess. Not that much of a cheapo to go for such stuff, especially since bean sprouts are the bane of my life.The ramen could be easily customized using the order form. Kinda idiot-proof. I went for the original with seaweed and flavored egg. And a little bit of spring onions. Don't quite get who would go for the 'no char siew' option.Despite the less oil option, there were a lot of pieces of fats in my noodles. I dutifully scooped out most of them.S's spicy red ramen with normal oil level. I didn't quite like the red spicy flavor as it was more of a dull piquantness than a savory one. The original broth was very rich and flavorful but it was also rather salty.Our verdict on the ramen. It's not bad. We concluded that the broth was on the same level as Santouka's or better. Santouka happens to be his favorite ramen in Singapore. I wasn't too pleased with the char siew though as it was drier and tougher than the high quality pork cheeks that we are used to at Santouka. But the egg? Simply awesome. I could inhale 5 of these realistically speaking. Nice gooey texture in the middle and the soy infusion right to the center of the egg. Lovely.I wouldn't mind coming back for ramen IF the queue isn't insane. Certainly one of the better ramens around.",

    "text": "So my quest to look for a decent bowl of ramen in Singapore (despite what you think of this metropolitan city where you can find almost every cuisine readily available, it is not -that- easy to find very good ramen) took me to this place where I dedicated a good part of my Friday night, post-work at. Queuing, that is.Be sure to come ready to queue at this little outlet (or the one nearby). If it helps, they serve you green tea and you can order your ramen first so your wait is shortened just by a little. Naturally, I was very hungry and full of expectation when my dinner partner and I were finally showed in.Ramen is served very quickly, along with your personal stash of beansprouts and boiled eggs. So that was a relief after the long wait. I picked the pepper ramen with regular soup broth and regular ramen (eat the way Japanese do is my battle plan for the day). Go for the regular soup broth if you, like me, are a fan of thick and rich broth which are just that slight bit salty. I love the way the flavours melt into the noodles. I wouldn't go for the pepper flavour - thought is was a little unncessary and will head straight for the original the next trip. (Yes, a next trip is already planned).If you are one for bites on the side like gyozas with your ramen, head for their other branch. I heard the gyozas are fabulous. Will be back to report on it.",

    "text": "I had passed by this place many times and seen a long queue outside at lunch and dinner, so I figured I definitely have to try it! Due to the long queue outside, I made sure I went early or lunch... and still had to wait. Still the wait wasn't long as the turnover rate is quite high, and people just eat and leave quickly. The place is really small and can seat only about 20ish people. Ambience here isn't fantastic, and it's not a place to hang around for a drink after. You just eat and go.While I was waiting in the line, I was given a menu to choose between the basic tonkotsu, the black spicy or the red spicy ramen. I picked the basic tonkotsu ramen special that came with all the toppings because I'm greedy like that. You get more for a top of a few dollars. They take your order while you're in line.At last, we managed to get seats near the counter, but it was interminably hot! Perhaps my corner didn't get much air circulation, or maybe we were just too near the counter where they prepared food, but it did get uncomfortable.My bowl arrived, still steaming, with a large sheet of seaweed sticking out on one side. I pushed the seaweed into the thick broth and mixed everything up. It was mouthwateringly fragrantThough it was unpleasant sweating over my bowl of ramen, I still enjoyed it immensely. The ramen noodles weren't the best, but they were springy - just the way I like it! The soup is probably one of the most authentic I've had in Singapore, really thick and milky, even if it was a bit salty. Be sure to grind your own sesame into the broth for an enhanced flavour. It definitely makes it taste yummier. I found the char siew meat a little tough, but the egg with the liquid yolk was just divine. I really like those eggs. But I found it hard to finish up all the soup. I normally do at other ramen places, but the soup here was a little too rich to drink by itself, or maybe i just wasn't in the mood that day.They also serve free hard boiled eggs on the table - free flow! You can eat as many hard boiled eggs as you want! I had 2 with my leftover soup and then gave up, but left with a very full stomach, feeling really satisfied with the meal here.",

Just like everyone else mentioned, be ready to queue (that's what local ppl say here in Singapore... having brought up in California, I just say \"be ready to stand in line\") upon arrival. If you are a huge ramen fan, I think it is worth it.You can personalize your ramen the way you want it to be. Just make sure you remember what your combination was, so that when the waiter brings you a bowl, you know you have the right one (and they speak with the local accent, so be ready to listen and focus).One thing I would like to do next time is that they have all-you-can-eat hard-boiled eggs at each table. Instead of ordering \"flavored egg\" for your ramen, I think this will work if you just drop the regular hard-boiled egg (the free ones) and let it sink in your ramen for a while.That would take a few SG$ off your bill.A bit on the expensive side, but I think they are staying true to the Japanese style.",

We had:1) Black Spicy Tonkotsu King ($11.80) with Flavoured Egg ($2): so thick the broth was practically viscous. I couldn't finish this, it was terribly cloying. I should have ticked the 'light' option for the soup base, this needed to be watered down to half its viscosity.2) Red Spicy Tonkotsu King ($11.80) with the option of Special Topping ($4) comprising a flavoured egg, seaweed, and stewed pork: just as stodgy. And the pork needed more flavour and stewing time.The best part of the meal was free: the marinated beansprouts that were totally refreshing, lightly spiced and delicious",

Whether it is the black, red or original, all are damn tasty! Savoury yet not oily! The flavoured egg was decent as well. But I would say one major disappointment was the meat. The meat was tough and cold :( And I also loved the interior of the place. Cosy (and most say SMALL), with lots of traditional ramen shop decor. I also loved that they played many Arashi songs when I was there (pardon me for the fangirl moment. haha)So overall, I'm still willing to give it a second chance! :)",

It's rich and almost reminiscent of your favourite black pepper crab memory.. except here, you can slurp is all up quite happily.I also prefer the noodles here. You can specify soft, normal or hard for noodle texture. I have a distinct preference for crunchy, thin noodles, and while I do like Ippudo and Santouka and all the rest, Tonkotsu King's noodles win for me. The rest of them leave me full and never wanting any more; Tonkotsu King's noodles always make me order 'kaedama' ($2 for extra noodles. Leave some soup for it). Slurp!It's more central than most of the other ramen hotspots, and the queue tends to be manageable. To be fair I wouldn't know about the regular version and the red version... but the black one is quite something!",

This little nook is more affectionately known as the \"Orchid Hotel ramen place\" - a lazy moniker referring to the building it is situated in. The place is always packed at lunchtime with a line of people sitting patiently on itsy bitsy stools that rests against the glass of its shop-front. Ramen here is taken extremely seriously and you get to make decisions like how hard you would like the noodles to be, what level of spiciness your broth should be and so on. The waitress leaves you to ruminate over you choices with a slip of paper and pencil and returns to hustle you to your seat when it is ready. You always enter to a couple of shouts from the kitchen, welcoming you in traditional Japanese fashion and soon a steaming bowl of ramen is plonked before you. The soup is flavourful but always a tad too oily for my liking and the slices of meat that come along with it are also much too tough. I do, however, enjoy their noodles because it is always springy and never overcooked. Mention this place and you will definitely be told about how your ramen is accompanied with free flow of eggs - that is probably the most exciting bit of news for me.",

    "text": "This popular ramen stop is located a couple minutes from Tanjong Pagar MRT station (exit Tanjong Pagar Road) and is adjoined to Orchid Hotel. You will often see a string of people waiting to get in. We went on a Sunday night at around 730pm, and, while bustling, we only waited about ten minutes for a seat. The small restaurant seats about 20-odd people and serves ramen - that's pretty much it, but you do get to make your own! When queuing outside, the waitress will hand you a piece of paper and you tick the boxes - do you want your ramen soft, normal or hard? Do you want to have light chicken oil or do you prefer your soup more artery-inducing? After ticking the boxes, you hand it to the waitress and wait for your turn to be seated. We waited around ten minutes (with about four groups of people ahead of us). The ramen is served pretty much the moment you sit down, so it ticks the box for fast service. Is it good? Well, I think there are better ramen places in Singapore, but for the bargain hunter there is a free-flow of eggs and you also get to ground your own sesame seeds in cute bowls to bring out the soup's flavour. Due to the speed and high volume, I thought the broth lacked consistency (I got mine with light chicken oil), but the noodles (I selected \"normal\") were just the right texture and flavour. Altogether we paid about $35 for two bowls of ramen (including everything), which comes up to about $17 each. That doesn't make it the cheapest place, but so I would give it an average rating for value-for-money and taste.",

This place is one of my top places to go to for ramen. And... they provide a free-flow of hard boiled eggs. What's there not to love?Let me first state my ramen preferences: I like bouncy noodles in a broth that isn't too rich (not gravy like) and oily, with a slice of char siew that contains enough fat to melt in your mouth. And a well cooked flavoured egg of course! I had the Black Spicy Ramen on my last visit, and it almost met all of my requirements. I was happy with the noodles and the broth, but found it a tad oily for my tastes. The char siew was perfect, and reminded me of the ones I've had in Japan. I've had better flavoured eggs elsewhere (Tampopo!). But overall, this is a pretty decent place to go to for ramen, and to bask in an authentic Japanese ramen bar setting.",

The same can also be said for a restaurant that you can find by following a cacophony of slurping. As you may have guessed, both of these things proved true at Keisuke Tonkotsu King. And while we could debate for days about the authenticity of the chasyu, or whether better shio, shoyu or kira miso can be found, it's really the amazing, amazing tonkotsu that made this spot queue-worthy. It's all customisable which I loved - not just your preferred extras, but your noodle texture, any ingredients you don't want floating around in there, the style and strength of your broth (red spicy, please!) and your oil level. And oh that amazing oil - it's like they picked up those piggy bones and wrung them out into a bowl the size of my face. It was milky and delicious - and for a moment I forgot that I was about to step back outside into 35 degree heat. They truly do churn through the queue, so don't expect it to be a leisurely lunch. My advice? Get there early, slurp away, and move on so the next person waiting can enjoy this deliciousness.",

If it's your first time, don't be shy. Go for the middle option for everything, don't ask for less oil. FAT IS FLAVOUR. Don't forget. The 'onsen' egg is done perfectly. There's a big basket of hard-boiled eggs for you to help yourself. You can grind your own sesame seeds. There's beansprouts for you to add to your soup. In terms of free condiments, (as far as I know) no one comes close to this shop. \u00a0So be forewarned. The soup is really rich, kind of greasy, and probably incredibly fattening.

I would say that I've never tasted any broth as thick and flavorful as Keisuke's Orchid Hotel - in Singapore. \u00a0In addition, you get to have a multi sensory experience - space is cramped (a la Japan), you crush some sesame seeds, and the aroma fills the shop. Technically you should go in, eat fast, and get out fast, similar to Japan (correct me if I'm wrong). Of course you can eat slowly to spend more time in the shop, but why deprive others of their noodles? :DTldr: broth thick, noodle/ramen qq (springy), meat is nice!

    "text": "Nearly perfect blend of flavor and spice. Being a food simpleton, I tried the Spicy Red Ramen with none of the extra accouterments. I wish the broth had a slightly more pork fat taste but I had a hard enough time finishing it as it came because I stuffed myself silly, like the good little tourist I am, on peanuts from Long Bar while I waited 20 minutes for my drink. I am giving 5 stars because I specifically requested a medium pork fat flavor, expecting the strong option to overwhelm the spice. I regret that decision but it was still a mighty fine bowl of ramen. My first in 6 months! Thanks Keisuke!",

Not bad, the size of the shop is not big, people tends not to sit long Like other reviews mentioned unlimited supply of free boiled eggs and bean sprouts, you can't eat much anyway.I have ordered a Tonkotsu King Ramen with seaweed. The noodle texture is just right and the taste of the soap is good, not too oily. I didn't give 5 stars because the soup is not hot (temperature) \u00a0enough. Service is excellent, very polite. I was impressed by though quite a bit of people queuing outside, they still kept refilling the water and no intention to kick you out after you finished. Most of us very discipline, eat and go. I will come back to this Ramen place next time. Worth to try if you never been there.",

Saw that they actually provided free barley for customers who are waiting in line to help themselves to, they even left several fans in case it get too hot. That's nice. I ordered:Black Spicy Ramen - the broth was thick and savory. I opted for the noodle as 'normal' texture so that's nice for me. The soup was not spicy at all, just a hint of it. The pork slices were thick and flavourful, but a little tough. I opted for additional flavour egg and it was good, soft & seasoned at the yoke. Free beans sprout - I thought it would be plain boiled bean sprouts but I was surprised to find a small jar of bean sprout goodness left on the table for your own service. Their bean sprouts were boiled and seasoned with sesame, spicy oil and something yummy. I only know I CANNOT stop eating that!! I wanted to whack the free eggs too but was way too full from the free bean sprouts to do so. Will return if in the area, just to whack the bean sprouts again!",

    "text": "You need to get lucky when you visit Keisuke as there is always an endless queue at this place during meal times - and working in the area, I attest to that personally as someone who has witness these queues for the last year or so. There is not a walk to the MRT station at the end of the day that I don't see a snaking queue outside this outlet. I got lucky - on two separate occasions in fact, once at lunch and the second time at dinner today. I say lucky because while there was a queue, the wait wasn't too long - we 'skipped' the queue during lunch because we had a table for our (smaller) group size opened up. At dinner today, we did have to wait for a bit (~15minutes) but again were lucky to skip past a group in front of us. So my tip here would be to go only in groups of 2! - the shop is rather small, so they have more 2 seaters, which gives you a higher chance of a shorter wait. I tried both the red spicy and black spicy tonkotsu noodles on the respective visits - added all ingredients in the red, and just an additional egg for the black (cause dinner needs to be a small meal :P). I have to say that while I loved both soup bases, their chashu is rather inconsistent. I loved the melt in your mouth piece that I got at dinner compared to the 3 rather tendon-filled, tough pieces that I got when I went for lunch. I think it's again, all about luck when you done here, depending on the day etc. because the same happened for my egg - Japanese ramen eggs are notoriously awesome because of its yolk consistency (at least for it it is) and the egg that I had at lunch was disappointing because it was more hard-boiled than runny. My colleague on the other hand had a perfectly runny egg. ): But I guess that was redeemed by the egg that I got when I went for dinner. They had free hard-boiled eggs at the table, as well as marinated bean sprouts that I would definitely recommend everyone to try! I guess for quite a number of people, this is a highlight though I wouldn't concur as most of the ramen places in the Tanjong Pagar area have this free hard-boiled egg perk. The food here is really good, when you get lucky - which is why the 4 stars. It lacks consistency in both the broth (my dinner partner had been here before, but he had horrible tasting broth - when we went for dinner, his feedback was that it was a lot better than his first try) and their ingredients, which I feel is really sad because every visit could be a hit or miss. Keisuke Tonkotsu has a sister branch nearby in 100AM serving the ramen with a chicken based broth instead, which I hope to go try someday.",

    "text": "My favorite ramen in Singapore! The bowls aren't perfect - perfect ramen should have perfect broth, noodles, charsiew, and Keisuke only gets 2/3 of these down pat - but it's never disappointed me since I was first brought here 4 years ago. Speaking of the 2/3 things, this chain of Keisuke (and likely the others as well, though I can only speak for Paya Lebar, Bugis Village branches) has such deliciously milky and rich broth!! Their menu is simple, with the original or black (pepper) or red (pepper + chili oil) versions. I ordered the black version, but I honestly don't see much difference between them - they're both really good. The noodles are also great, al-dente, not too soft, not too chewy, delicious. It's not the sapporo style ones that resemble instant ramen, but the straight-cut Hakata-style, just like Ippudo's. If you've a bigger eater, definitely order extra ramen for a few bucks!Also, I didn't list the flavored egg as one of my criteria for perfect ramen since its pretty much a basic pre requisite. Keisuke's is perfect and hits the spot. The charsiew is a little meh. Nothing special. The little extra perk that Keisuke offers is the free-flow bean sprouts salad & hard-boiled eggs. Some people go really crazy on the hard-boiled eggs and I don't really understand why, but to each his own. I'm a huge fan of the bean sprouts! They taste slightly spicy and sweet and are so addictive. I gulp down whole bunches of these with my noodles. I'm not kidding, sometimes I literally finish half the container at my table. Kind of strange, but this is definitely one of my favorite things about Keisuke!",

    "text": "Welp. What a disappointment. But let's start with what went well. The broth is great and is how a good tonkotsu broth should be : thick, rich and extremely flavorful for all 3 types: normal, black (peppery) spicy and red (chilli) spicy. The oils, ground sesame seeds went well with it. The noodle was nice and firm. The portion of meat was great. For 15.80, it came with all the good sides, including 4-5 big slices of pork And that's exactly when things went to crap. Those big slices of pork. Oh, they held so much promise. But the first warning sign came when I noticed that any signs of the good ole usual layers of fats seem to be missing. Strange. Maybe they were using a lean cut. But nope. Biting into it was like gnawing into a gunny sack. Dry. Oh god SO tough. Flavorless. It was awful. Enough to spoil the meal for me I guess. The chef has clearly way way waaaay over cooked the meat, making it extra tough and dry, and of course, melting all the fats away. In short, I would sorta recommend this place if you're vegetarian and looking for some great ramen and broth. However if you, like me, find the pork to be an extremely integral part of a good tonkotsu ramen, I would recommend you stay far far away",

Imagine hot soup in a really empty stomach at 10pm. The best way to cure hunger. I have to say the service was pleasant. Whilst waiting for our turn to get into the restaurant. We were offered free Japanese Barley Tea. Which was actually barley rice tea. And we waited for a mere 15 minutes and we were in. Our waitress was great and got us settled easily. What helped this place is that our orders were pre-taken when we were waiting outside the restaurant to get in. great concept. We barely sat for 5 mins and our food arrived. Pictures were taken and it was then time to eat.While this is a good place for Ramen, there are better ones. The broth didn't speak much to me, And i really had wanted to try the lobster king ramen. but it wasn't available here, only at their clarke quay branch.Well i would have to give it a taste soon. Ill be back!!!",
