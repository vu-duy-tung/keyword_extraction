    "text": "There was a time when ilLido was the top of mind recall when one mentions Italian Fine Dining. Then things went a little down south and they moved out of the Sentosa Golf Club in Aug last year. A revival came in the form of a merge with The Cliff in Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Resort & Spa early this year. Now, diners can pretend to be on the Amalfi coast, indulging in gourmet Italian classics with the gorgeous backdrop of the South China Sea at the new ilLido at the Cliff.It's easy to forget you're still in Singapore once you step into the luxurious Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Resort & Spa. Breathtaking views and lush tropical greenery conjure the seaside holiday vibe. On a good day, the alfresco area is perfect for enjoying your meal and view without leaving unsightly sweat stains. Otherwise, head indoors to the elegant restaurant where you can feast on the extensive menu featuring seasonal antipasto, pastas, and wholesome Italian mains.Simple fresh goodness is the Burrata with Rucola and Cherry Tomatoes ($26) with compressed tomato and pesto. The cheese is flown from Italy and has a firmer texture than my usual creamy milky preference but a decent burrata no doubt.The Grilled Octopus with Roman Artichokes ($28) was skillfully prepared. \u00a0No tug of war or jaw-breaking chew to get a piece of this nicely charred octopus into your belly.I'd recommend the octopus along with the Hokkaido Scallops with Nduja and Sweet Pea Cream ($29). See that golden sear? What you don't see is the light pink succulent center that is so delightfully sweet.Tuna Tartare with Salmon Roe and Sea Urchin Hollandaise ($26)- was a refreshing dish. It looked like a garden and tasted like one. Mild tuna, ikura and pops of capers were coated by a faint sea urchin hollandaise. Was looking forward to the Uni sauce but i couldn't taste any bit of the creamy roe in the dish.Handmade egg pastas are the best and ilLido at the Cliff sure lives up to its Italian fame. The Pappardelle with Smoked Pork Jowl ($30) has light chewy sheets coated with a sweet almond sauce and \u00a0a hint of balsamic. Each mouthful balanced with the salty melt-in-your-mouth pork. The meat may be a tad salty on its own but it's perfect with the pasta sheets. Plus it still tastes great even when cold! Fettuccine with Venison Ragu and Radicchio Tardivo ($32) was another favorite! This pulled meat has absorbed all that braising sauce for a flavorful bite. The radicchio tardivo lent a crisp bitter crunch that complemented the sweet meat.A familiar taste of home was found in the Tagliolini with Scallops and Truffle ($35). The thin noodles were like our Chinese Mee Kia but this was elevated with the lovely sear on the scallops and the light truffle scent. There were generous shavings of truffle but strangely we didn't taste much of it. For your Secondi, definitely go with the Kurobuta Pork Milanese ($45) fried in clarified butter, served on top a Butternut pur\u00e9e and Cherry Tomatoes! I tend to avoid fried pork as they easily turn dry and coarse but not this one. Firm, lean but juicy meat in a buttery and thin crispy batter, paired with a creamy pur\u00e9e. I would love to have more of that pumpkin for sure!The Wagyu Beef Cheek with Spinach and Beetroot puree ($38) may look like a massacre but it is taste and texture over presentation for this one. All connective tissues have been broken down, resulting in flavorful bites held together by collagen. The beetroot added a light natural sweetness which was welcomed. That said, flavors are mild in this one and \u00a0could do with a sharp accent to balance it. For the milder palates, go with the Black Cod with Caramelized Celeriac and Lemon Capers ($38). That if you're really mild. It was forgettable IMO.For dessert, look forward to Italian classics like the signature ilLido Tiramisu and the Almond Panna Cotta with Peaches and Pistachios ($18). Such smooth milky creamy curd with bursts of light sweetness from the peach! And crunch from the cookie crumble. Lovely! I thought the Buffalo Ricotta Cheese and Orange Cake ($18) was rather interesting as it was slightly salty! This baked sponge makes for a lighter dessert with a citrus perfume. Enjoy the contemporary Italian fare at ilLido at the Cliff along with their compilation of Old and New World wines like Amarone, Barolo, Brunello, and France's Bordeaux and Burgundy.Their 3-course set lunch menu is only priced at $38 and \u00a05-course gourmet menu at $88. Keep a lookout for ilLido's Weekend Brunch with free-flow Prosecco ( $128/pax) later in the year.",

    "text": "ilLido was a well known restaurant and was used to be located at the Sentosa Golf Club, overlooking the sea. It offers delectable Italian classics made only from the finest seasonal ingredients from Italy. The restaurant has recently reopened at the nearby Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Resort & Spa and renamed as ilLido at the Cliff. Similar to its previous location, the restaurant overlooks the sea, offering a cooling and windy environment for those having alfresco dining. Those who dislike the hot and humid, there is always the indoor dining area with air con. Indoor it was decorated in a grand way with comfortable armchairs and sofa seats.The easiest to reach the restaurant will be by driving or by taxi. There is the half-hourly shuttle bus service provided by the hotel between Vivocity Shopping Mall and the hotel, but it is only for hotel guests. Another way to get to the hotel is to board half-hourly Sentosa Island Bus 3 from the Beach Station, after boarding the Sentosa Express from Vivocity Shopping Mall.This week the restaurant is offering 'FEAST OF THE OCEAN' menu as part of the restaurant week promotion (from 19 March to 26 March 2016), with dishes specially created by its chef. For the lunch, the set meal costs $40++, which includes an appetizer, a pasta dish, a main course, a dessert and ends with a cup of coffee or tea.Bread with vinegar and olive oil dipWe were served with 2 types of bread, which both are quite soft and fluffy on theirs own.Lobster Knuckles Salad with Asparagus, Mango & Balsamic VinegarThe juicy lobster meat was topped with a fruity, tangy salsa like topping which was quite refreshing and opened up one's appetite.Green Polenta Tortelli with Cod & Fresh Sicilian TomatoThis was quite a surprise dish to be found in a Italian restaurant. The intense flavours of spicy and sweet tomato sauce reminded me of local well known dish 'chilli crab'. The tortelli was like dumpling, stuffed with the buttery smooth polenta.Roasted Seabass with Celeriac & Saffron CaciuccoThe fish was meaty and chunky, well accompanied by the tangy seafood based tomato sauce.White Chocolate & Hazelnut Coulant with Amaretto KellyIt looked like a fluffy pie, served with strawberries, blueberries, golden colored jelly and gold color coated hazelnut. It cut open easily with the \u00a0molten filling flowing out easily. The filling was nutty without tasting too sweet.Coffee & TeaWe ended the meal with a choice of coffee or tea. Tea was a blend from well known local brand TWG, which was light and smooth. The coffee was rich and thick.Overall the food was delicious and filling. The environment was very relaxing and time passed quite fast and easily. Although there was children dining at the next table, it was not noisy. Service was great. Water was refilled often. The chef even went about asking about the food.",

    "text": "Disappointed. Service is poor, especially for a restaurant situated in a classy hotel like Sofitel. We were 30 mins late for our reservation and the server glanced down at her watch, let us in but made us feel bad with that gesture. We waited 10 mins at the side with no water, no menus and was only seated when we asked if our table was ready. We asked for a table in cooler area but we were seated in a corner with no fan. The restaurant was only 60 percent full and there were many tables open. Not sure why it took so long for them to prepare a table for us and why we couldn't have a cooler table. No attempt from the servers to engage guests in explaining the menu or recommendations. Very transactional in general.Food tastes fine, nothing too special. Overpriced but I'm not surprised because guests are really paying for the view. View isn't as great as one of the restaurants on fort canning.Overall a disappointing experience. Not worth it!",

I'd be annoyed if we had trekked all the way out to Sentosa but thankfully we were having a staycation at the Sofitel. The service was excellent so that was a definite plus but the food was relatively uninspired. Nothing was bad, it just wasn't amazing which is a shame for the setting and price. My husband had the tiramisu for dessert and while I realise that it was the chef's take on the dessert, it really should have been called something else as there was no delicious, boozy sponge at the bottom!",

The outdoor seating had an expansive view of the sea, and it was beautiful. I can imagine it would be tres romantic at night. Service was by and large good. What I felt was lacking was the food. While tasty, I'm not sure if it packed a memorable punch. The scallops were scrumptious but the sirloin was not. A bit too chewy for my liking. The dessert was very prettily plated but not outstanding. Oh well. Hit and misses. The superior view and ambience singularly lifted this place from a 3-star to a 4-star rating.",

    "text": "Designer setting, comforting foodHad the good fortune to attend an intimate wedding dinner recently at Il Lido, which reminded me I hadn't been back in awhile. The solemnisation was held on the balcony, while the dinner took place indoors. The Italian cuisine, while traditionally robust, is plated for the modern connoisseur - meaning that it looks like art on the plate and tastes even better. There are sweeping views to add to a romantic night out - no wonder my friends booked out the whole restaurant! The chef is very good with seafood as well as handmade pastas - I've visited at least 4 times now, and the pasta is always as good and al dente to the bite as I remember it. For dessert, the showstopper is the dark chocolate lava cake with a dramatic sweep of balsamic vinegar - very clever combination and you'll be thinking of it til long after. Service too is well put together.",

It included an amuse bouche, an appetizer (three prawns done to perfection on a bed of egg plant), crab meat pasta (which I wished I had a whole bowl of because the flavor was so good that it filled the whole dining room, even when other tables were having it), and a main course (choice of cod or beef cheek). The cod looked pitifully small, but my beef cheek was just sufficient). The creme brulee I had was wonderful and earned my stamp of approval when it passed the spoon-sugar-top crack that creme brulee should have. \u00a0I would recommend the set menu, and coming around sunset time for the view.",
