But I made a rookie mistake of having juice from a nearby stand (after only finishing breakfast about half an hour before... Late breakfast... :-p ).But geeze was it worthed going there and feeling like I could explode from eating too much this morning. We only realized that the noodles has prawns in it when I started to order, and then we found out the broth is seafood based as well. Luckily, can they were nice enough to \u00a0whip up a simple broth for me. Even though I'm sure it's not as good as the normal broth, it was still awesome. And the char siu...it melts in the mouth. Every mouth full was loaded with flavor. Definitely worth the visit.",

    "text": "The noodles definitely achieve the shop's goal of serving \"gourmet noodles at hawker prices.\" The flavors in the dish are extremely fresh and the broth is very well-seasoned. 4 stars just because the service - while trying to operate most efficiently in a small space - can be a bit awkward, as you're prompted to state your order while still halfway down the line, at a point when you can't actually read the menu, so it's tough to decide any additions / modifications you may want to make to the order other than the size of the portion. Although the wait is not nearly as bad as other reviews make it out to be - once I had located the stall, I maybe waited 20 mins in total between joining the line and receiving my food at 12:30pm, peak lunch hour.",

We got two small bowls of Singaporean style ramen and we both enjoyed it a lot!The noodles, the broth, all the dressings were phenomenal. \u00a0The slow cooked egg was silky and creamy. Chirashi pork was delish! My boyfriend wants to come back here again after the rush hour, as you can see the line getting significantly shorter after 1:30pm. And they are open till 7:30Also since it was hard for me to find the food center I bookmarked Gayatri Restaurant, the place right outside of it, so it's easy to find it next time. The hawker center is two stories, and the Noodles are in the ground level.$7 SGD per small bowl of ramen. I think it's worth it.",

For me, this Ramen tasted like your typical wonton noodles with a lot of add-ons. Aside from wontons, they added a runny egg, potato crisp covered prawn and char siu. I like how they thought about making this bowl of noodles in a typical hawker set-up. Overall, I would say it's worth a try!",

I came right when they opened, because I knew there'd be a long line. Around lunch time, this place is packed with business people on their lunch break. They have three sizes and I went with the medium. Get the chili!! Once you get your bowl, mix it all up! Their cha-su is probably the best I've ever had!! Their HK style wontons were beyond amazing! Their crispy wrapped prawn was nice and crunchy! And their egg cooked to perfection! I've never anything so good and it's a must stop if you're in Singapore!!",

And a long line of people waiting for food, which is a good sign. I waited like 20-25 minutes to order. There's just one thing, the noodles, but you can get small, medium, or large. And you can add on extra sides (like an extra egg or more HK style wontons). The lady behind me said that the larger sizes just come with more noodles. After I placed my order for a small bowl, the light for the sign went out. The lady behind me said that that meant they ran out of stuff! I had such good timing! The noodles were SO delicious! No broth. Noodles were amazing. The hard-boiled egg was cooked perfectly. The potato wrapped shrimp was super tasty. And the wontons and chashu pork were yummy! A perfect 10. My noodles also came with a soup. Totally worth the wait!!!",

My guess is that they don't use MSG, but unlike Japanese ramen shops, don't have enough ingredients that contribute their own umami.Of course, these are small grouses given the very reasonable price of $5.5-$7.5. It's certainly worth a try if you're near Amoy.",

    "text": "Visited this shop approximately a month ago. Came with a high expectation amid the fanfare generated by the Michelin announcement, and the plethora of cool pictures on Instagram.Ordered the jumbo plate and it was.... okay. Many people loved its concept of a Singapore-style ramen, but it was fusion-confusion for me. Personally, I found it pretty weird to be eating a wanton (Chinese dish) immediately after a cha-shu (Japanese dish), In entirety, the taste profiles of the ingredients just did not blend elegantly enough. In addition, I found the noodles too cluttered in a lump, making it tough to eat. Finally, the chilli looked cool, but tasted pretty dry.Nonetheless, I was deeply impressed by the quality of the ingredients, and that the owners decided not to cut corners despite the price point and hawker-food positioning. The potato wrapped prawn was also pretty incredible - crunchy and tasty. And yes, the bowl of noodle was full of cool ingredients that would make it very much Instagram-worthy.Does it deserve a Bib Gourmand? Probably not for me, although the owners are still pretty young and will only go up from there. I applaud their audacity to sort of reinvent the wheel, and I look forward to trying their dish again in a year.",

Careful attention and detailed work. The result? A damn good bowl of wan ton mee. Don't expect the fiery chilli like eng's or the one at da Jie.
