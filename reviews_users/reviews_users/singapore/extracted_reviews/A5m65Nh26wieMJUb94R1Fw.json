    "text": "I still like Jollibee's fried chicken though the size seemed to have shrunk. And when did they start offering a spicy and original option? Trying to be like the other fried chicken joints here?I usually go around 1130am when it is quieter. I was surprised to see a crowd at 1230pm ish on a weekday. My colleague told me to avoid going on Sundays as it would be packed to the gills. It seemed like the queue system has changed. Instead of a snaking single line leading to the many cashiers, it went to the typical many lines. And it also looked like they allowed people to find a table first before waiting in line. Luckily we still manage to snag a table after looking hard. The fried chicken was still good. We had a mix of original and spicy. The spicy was pretty hot though it was only confined to the skin. So I would suggest getting original and dipping the meat into chili sauce instead. The fries were still bad. The buttered corn was good and mashed potato decent.",

    "text": "In this review I will be comparing this Jollibee to the stores in America because the only other country I've had jollibees is in America (specifically California and Florida). This Jollibee is located on the sixth floor of Lucky Plaza. It's a pretty big store with a lot of seating inside so you won't miss it if you're walking by. The employees are abundant and friendly. They were still taking orders and letting people in past 9PM which was great for us because we walked in super late. Unfortunately, they only had a few pieces of original chicken left so we ordered whatever they had left.The chicken wasn't as crispy as I remember it being but that might've been because we ordered all the leftover chicken right before they closed. The menu was a bit limited - they didn't have some of my favorite desserts like the peach mango pie or halo halo. They also don't have sliders. However, I'm not sure if Singapore Jollibees stores have a different menu than the ones in America.I felt that the serving size was smaller than the sizes in America. The mashed potato side I had was very little and left me wondering if I should have ordered more. As for flavor, everything tasted consistent. I am still obsessed with Jollibees gravy - I can pour that on anything and be able to eat it.Overall, an average Jollibee with okay food and good service. Even though it is a bit cheaper here than in America, I'm still missing my favorite menu items and the larger American portion size.",

    "text": "So Jollibee finally launches its first outlet in Singapore...and there happens to be a bunch of idiots running a Facebook page screaming for people to boycott Jollibee Singapore...for some illogical reason that only their neanderthal brains could possibly understand-to-be-logical.Anyways, I'm glad whoever these tards were...they didn't add to the obviously insane queues that welcome this amazing establishment in Singapore. Our first attempt of a UYE here failed miserably when our tiny group was not even allowed to join the line at 1830 hrs because THERE WAS JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE! Having finally witnessed such a ridiculous line, I made note to myself not to come back here for another month or so.ENTER...my fine lady, who is so sweet in every possible manner and always ever thoughtful. She remembered that the last UYE was a flop and asked if I wanted to give it a shot again. Of course, I'd love to give it a shot again...when the LINES are - maybe - GONE? X)I don't know about any of you BUT lines are always a turn-off EVEN if the food is spectacular UNLESS I'm in line with amazing company. The two hours we were in queue was probably one of the most fun moments I've had in a LONG time. Chatting, joking, playing stupid games on the phone, and making ridiculous jokes about the world, we slowly worked ourselves through the hordes and eventually got to order.So, if you think I'm going to stop at 1 chicken joy...after being in queue that long, THINK again...3x Chicken Joy1x Burger Steak2x Burger Yum w/ TLC2x Spaghetti2x 1pc Chicken w/ SpaghettiOkay, I ate most of it...and my sweet lady helped out. I bought a little extra as well to treat two Filipino friends who didn't believe that Jollibee was in Singapore.All-in-all...a good day.*******RECOMMENDATIONS:If you're going to bother lining up, make sure you try the Chicken Joy...makes Popeyes, KFC, and Church's (I mean Texas Chicken) look like they don't know fried chicken.Everything...else? Comfort food only for those who grew up eating it.Yelp 100: 21/100",

    "text": "Why is it more fun in the Philippines? Because their bees are jolly and they sell chicken!What kind of bees make milk?Boo Bees!!Okay, I think that's enough bee jokes for this review... ANYWAYS, this famous Filipino fast food chain finally came to Singapore and there were way too many people excited about this, so I wasn't able to taste the goodness 'til a few months later. I've been to the Philippines before; however it's been a hot minute since I've experienced the bee!I ordered the Chickenjoy and spaghetti combo- delicious and well priced at $6.60. Filipino spaghetti sauce is different in that it's sweeter, but it ain't truly Filipino unless you put hot dogs or Vienna sausage in it! The piece of chicken I had was crispy, juicy, sizable, and soooo much better than Popeye's!I've also tried the fries, but they're nothing to write home about. They do come with chili sauce, which is ok and not spicy.I've only visited during off peak times, and they're still quite busy. They've really mastered keeping the line moving, so the wait isn't bad. I think they still have a few pesky restrictions in place, ie your entire party has to be present and you can't order more than one meal per person, so keep that in mind if you decide to stop by.If I like it so much, why don't I just give it 5 stars and marry it? Well, first off, I'm already married, and second, it's a fast food chain- to keep my reviews and ratings distribution fair, it's my personal policy to give fast food chains 3 stars at most (unless they go above and beyond and save my life... Or give me a lifetime supply of free food. Just sayin'.)",

    "text": "Ever since Filipino fast-food chain Jollibee (which specializes in their fried chicken) opened their first outlet in Singapore at Lucky Plaza, crowd here has never failed to get shorter, with queues stretching over to the neighbouring units. However, the queue clears off fast as well, though be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes to make your order.The 2-piece Chickenjoy with Rice and Drink ($6.60, +$0.20 to up-size drink) is the signature dish of the place. It's not hard to see why. The chicken is crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. As such, oiliness of the fried chicken is kept to the minimum. The rice and chicken is best mixed and dipped into the gravy provided, which tasted similar to the chicken gravy used in KFC's Whipped Potato.If you do not want rice, the 1-piece Chickenjoy with Spaghetti and Drink ($6.60, +$0.20 to up-size drink) is an alternative. This meal was topped up with additional fries ($1.50). The spaghetti is sweet and is full on tomato taste. The fries are crisp but is certainly not one of their highlights.Definitely one of the better fried chicken joints around the Orchard area. Don't let the queues repel you from going!",

Tender and juicy. It's not thickly \u00a0coated with flour and is well marinated. Just that I'm confused with the combination. Personally I think rice and fried chicken don't go well together as they are rather dry. The chicken is already good enough enough to eat on its own so I used the gravy for the rice. Again, the gravy and rice don't taste right together and I don't mean the combi is awful. Maybe the gravy would be more suitable for grilled meat? Good fried chicken but I won't make a special trip down:)",

After some negotiating, a bunch of us left for a super early lunch at 11.30am only to be met by a snaking queue at Jollibee. A queue that took 1.5hours. A queue that a quarter way in, I'd exhausted all my Candy Crush lives. Imagine the horror. Seats were easily found, and we got our Chickenjoy. With all this hype, I'd expect rainbows to shoot out of our mouths at first bite. Or for angels to sing as we tore apart our meat. But alas no rainbows or angels there. Sure, the chicken is moist and homely tasting. And there's an interesting pat of rice served with your fried fowl. Which goes ok with the accompanying gravy. There's a bee mascot making his/her/its rounds, and getting terrorised by the kids in the restaurant. The kids relentlessly smack the bee's (padded) butt and stab his/her/its eyes but the bee's minder doesn't interject, which is a bit strange. Sure, it makes for entertainment but it's also a bit like animal abuse no?Don't stone me for saying this but... I don't get the hype. Possibly because in my books, nothing without rainbows and angels is worth a 1.5hour wait. And.. don't kill me for saying this but... I kinda prefer KFC for a more robust crunch and spicier packeted chili sauce.",
