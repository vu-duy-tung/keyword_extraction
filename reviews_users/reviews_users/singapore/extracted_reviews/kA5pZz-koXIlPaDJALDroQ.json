Now it's \u00a0really pleasure to climb Ann Siang hill steps via the the temple and enter the beautifully cool interior.Love love love the white wine sangria and the laksa pesto.",

The three level shophouse has a beautiful rooftop bar, which is frequented by the office crowd after work. Expect the normal PS Caf\u00e9 fare here and their fabulous cakes. The vibe here is better for a date and is more intimate than the Dempsey Hill restaurant. Also a nice place to go for a quick lunch. They have nice sets with sandwhiches and soup. I tried the prawn sandwhich with truffled mushroom soup. Service is always great here too.",

But the portion of the fries is huge, so come with at least three other friends if you don't want to feel too bloated.I also tried the Laksa Pesto, which sounds great on the menu, but I think people are going to either love it or hate it. it's basically spaghetti tossed in the laksa leaf with fishball slices and prawns. It's unique, to be sure. Last came the double chocolate cake, which was too rich for my tastes. I gagged halfway through the cake and just couldn't finish it.The highlight of the evening was the strawberry sangria, which was perfect to wash down the whole meal.It's a bit pricey, but the ambience is fantastic and the food unique. Worth trying at least once for yourself!",

When we made a call to the manager to ask him to reconsider since we can't predict who would fall sick on the day, he said it was too bad and we should inform 2 days in advance. He then rudely informed us that he is very busy and hung up. My boss hadn't even signed the bill when she got the sms that it was already charged to her Amex (which was used to make the reservation). They then gave us a $50 \"GIFT\" voucher. It isn't really a gift when we had already paid for it. This was in very bad taste and horrendous customer service.",

Which I enjoy. \u00a0I also noted that prices for drinks and food were higher (especially drinks) if not eating street food, or at a casual local establishment. \u00a0The food was OK. With the higher price tag, I expect my food to be somewhat remarkable. My group had the super food salad, pad thai salad, chicken in a basket, and shoe string truffle fries. \u00a0I didn't understand the hype around the fries, as they were just typical fries, with a dash of truffle oil, and a sparse sprinkling of parmesan cheese on top. \u00a0Mediocre compared to the many truffle fries I have had in my life. \u00a0The salads were not bad, just lacking in flavor. \u00a0What was the best here were the drinks! \u00a0The Rose Sangria was the best sangria I have EVER had. \u00a0It even came with edible flowers! \u00a0The flavors were remarkable. \u00a0I would definitely go back here just for a drink or tea and enjoy the ambiance of the space and have a good conversation with friends.",

The cheese souffle was quite a unique concept, but not worth trekking all the way here for. Strangely, the poached egg was rendered utterly flavorless; even the flavor of the egg was mysteriously missing. At first I thought they forgot salt the water, but the yolk also had no flavor. Something as classic as poached eggs needn't be experimented with by amateurs. The staff were quite discriminatory as to how they treated their customers. Certain groups were given an \"Asian menu\" while others were given a detailed description of water and bruch specials. While the service may vary depending on the status of your outerwear, the service charge remains fixed at 10%. Save your money and try some of the many other places in Singapore for brunch.",

The other way emphasizes the hill that this restaurant is perched upon.Service by the staff was overall disappointing (not mentioning any specials, not offering water after declining alcohol, and slow to attend). Would not have noticed had we not seen the better treatment of other tables. Maybe it was our attire, or passing on the chance to order drinks? Very disappointing given the ambiance, steep price point for some spotty food, and automatic 10% gratuity on your bill. You can get much better for less in an expensive city like San Francisco!Food: The chorizo chili hash (29 SGD) w/ poached egg would have been decent, had it not been for the unusual lack of spiciness and insipid poached egg. I'm baffled as to how you can maintain the texture of a poached egg yet have no flavor even in the egg yolk! The portobello brunch souffl\u00e9 (27SGD) was more unique, looking like a burger made of souffl\u00e9 buns and a portobello patty with toppings. Nice flavor although a little small, and despite the inclusion of another bland poached egg.Cocktails are all over 20SGD, so a single drink plus entree easily puts you in $$$$ territory for Singapore according to Yelp. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the excellent quality of food and service often found in San Francisco (especially all of its wonderful $$ brunch spots), but there are many other brunch places worth exploring first in Singapore before bothering with PS Cafe.",

We had ordered a full brunch and had spent quite a bit on food and drinks between the three of us. When I asked for an explanation and clarified with the waiter that it would have been great if we had been told nicely or if he had explained the urgency of the situation, we were met with even more hostility and defensiveness.

Tucked in at the very end of the Street was PS Cafe. We have eaten at the branch in Orchard Rd and really enjoyed it so decided to go in. We got a table on the next level up and waited a little longer than we would have liked before our order was taken, but that turned out to be a very minor gripe. We ordered a Bloody Mary each and they appeared quickly. They were as good a Bloody Mary as we have had in Singapore. Not too strong, and not too much ice, allowing the flavors to stay right to the end. The Calamari appetizer appeared soon after we ordered it. Hot, crispy, with two dips, we shared it and watched it disappear quickly. It was hard to pick an entree as there were so many good choices on the menu. \u00a0Eventually we made our decision, a Caesar Salad and a Tiffin Lamb Salad. The Caesar salad was very good with just about the right balance of ingredients. Very fresh. The star of the show was the Tiffin Lamb Salad with a wonderful piece of lamb sliced up on top of a good fresh garden salad with some chopped cucumbers in raita, a curried potato salad and a creamy coconut salad on the side. We gauged incorrectly that we had enough room for dessert, a Pecan pie and a Banana and Caramel pie. Both came with delicious scoop of ice cream. Washed down with a good cup of coffee and you have the perfect meal. We stole a quick trip onto the roof and got a glorious view of the shophouses of Chinatown withe the gargantuan CBD offices in the background.",

I went upstairs to grab a table because downstairs told me their small bites menu was still available. Upstairs didn't know that.There isn't a lot on that menu. I got a petit burger (2 bites small), truffle fries (huge and I felt bad for wasting), and the veggie dip. The truffle fries were really good but how much can I eat in one sitting? The veggie sticks came with 3 dips. I only really liked one. As I was eating, the servers was buzzing around setting up tables for the next day, so service wasn't too bad or slow. They were pretty rushed though. Before I finished my dinner, they asked if I wanted dessert because they had to shut the system. I got the sticky date pudding with toffee and ice cream - very good. Overall the quality of the food was very good. Def a nice ambience and for a nicer meal. Their dessert menu is huge and as a dessert fiend, I wish there were more mouths to feed so I could try more items.Also like that they have tons of magazines - perfect for a solo diner!It is NOT cheap though, so be prepared when you walk in.",

    "text": "After having noodles, it was dessert time at P.S. Cafe@Ann Siang Hill. It was full house, and I forgot how they managed to allocate two bar seats for us.The Pecan Pie with Ice Cream is indeed very close to those you see on Martha Stewart Show or the classic Louisiana's style pecan pies. Served chilled (not reheated at all), the sticky brown molasses that intertwined with the nuts were very sweet and fragrant but the pecan nuts were slightly rancid. And at the price of $14++ for this, I thought I had made a rash decision to come here.Gotta think thrice before stepping in ~",

    "text": "This is a review of a large group meal (approx 12) at P.S. Cafe at Ann Siang Hill.First, the staff did not seem to be affected by the size of the group or that some folks arrived late. \u00a0They just rolled with it. \u00a0The staff remained courteous, professional, and responsive throughout the meal.The interior is a combination of classic and modern. \u00a0It is a comfortable space.The food seemed to be appreciated by everyone. \u00a0I will focus on the food I actually tried.Fried Calamari - This was quite good. \u00a0The breading was crisp and light. \u00a0It allowed the taste of the calamari to shine through. \u00a0The calamari was cooked very well without an hint of being tough.tinyurl.com/bvr4chpTruffle Fries - These were quite good. \u00a0I think the truffle flavour was a touch overpowering. \u00a0The fries were perfectly cooked.tinyurl.com/d9unv8dPS Burger - I had their burger. \u00a0First, it was cooked to a proper medium rare. \u00a0I always consider it a win when a burger has fried onion strings on it. \u00a0All of the ingredients were of high quality. \u00a0The burger came together very well. \u00a0There was a nice balance of bun, meat, and other ingredients.tinyurl.com/d54yrfuChocolate Cake - This is an impressive looking large slice of chocolate cake. \u00a0But, beyond that, it was a relatively average chocolate cake. \u00a0It didn't really come off as being that decadent with the chocolate content.tinyurl.com/cj94kvwWhile I have not linked to them, I did upload photos of quite a few other desserts. \u00a0The apple pie and the date pudding were quite good.Their lime juice was overly bitter. Overall - This was a very nice meal. \u00a0The service was very good. \u00a0The room is comfortable. \u00a0The food was consistently good to great. \u00a0Everyone had a nice time.",

    "text": "The whole experience was marred by the appearance of a baby cockroach running across our table. We trapped the insect under a glass cup and called the waitress over to remove it. I had already finished my pasta and my partner was halfway through his meal. It was disconcerting to find cockroach running across the table at a posh place like this - very highly unacceptable.When the waitress saw the insect, she didn't seem surprise but took her time to remove the insect. She also didn't offer any apologies.By then, we were both quite unsettled.The food was ok but quite forgettable when compared to the cockroach. The PS Bolognaise that I order (forgotten the name) was not bad while the Chicken Parmigiano that my partner ordered was delicious. We wanted to try something different and called for the Coconut Bakewell Tart which took a long while to come - 30 mins. The same waitress took our order and we were wondering why it took so long when we saw the row of cakes/tarts in front of us. She also didn't bother to inform us upon taking our order.Finally the cake came - it was warm but not to our liking. The coconut taste was too strong and the texture of the cake was rough. For fans of the Key Lime Pie, I would suggest sticking to the tried and tested desserts.Upon asking for the bill, I was annoyed that at that point nothing was done to apologize or make the situation better. The waitress brought us the bill and upon seeing my annoyed face, did a half-hearted apology and said since we ordered dessert, the dessert was on the house. I wondered if there would be any service recovery had we not ordered any dessert?The food at Jamie's Italian (Vivocity) was over-rated but I would say the atmosphere and service was top-notch. Of course, a comparison cannot be made like that but with the price of the food, we would definitely go back to a place where the service was excellent instead of one where the service is poor and cockroaches run amok.",

    "text": "PS Cafe is an old stalwart that just keeps giving. Long before there were trendy industrial-chic third wave cafes and cocktail bars hidden down manholes and inside lamp posts, there was PS Cafe. And it still delivers. Maybe the menu isn't as innovative as your Burnt Endz and your Keong Saiks, and maybe the coffee tastes like something that came out of a single-boiler monstrosity in Italy circa 1963 but it's a solid, dependable restaurant with good fare and a great atmosphere.I like the Ann Siang outpost in particular. It's hidden in a leafy enclave off Club St, has multiple stories and is cloaked in leather and rich mahogany. I'm pretty sure Ron Burgundy would approve, as do I.",

    "text": "Walking into the PS Cafe at Ann Siang Hill is like a teleportation machine to Europe. Whether you feel it's like a French Brasserie or an Italian Trattoria, this is a superb cozy little place. Good for business meetings or a lunch with your colleagues for celebrations or just chilling out for TGIF drinks. The 2nd floor is really like a trattoria, long tables and great for groups. The 3rd floor is like dining on the attic, in front of the large floor length windows or outside on the roof. It is romantic and makes you forget that you're actually just taking a breather from work. I won't talk too much about the food because you'd go there really for the ambience and the drinks. Yes, this is an adult joint, as the sign outside clearly states, no children aloud. Expat mothers not allowed to bring their crying babies in tow. This is really why it's perfect for business lunches and what not. The cocktail concoctions are hard hitting. From interesting white sangria with white chrysanthemum in the mix to the muddy mojito that packs a punch. It'll do for lunch. Of course they have a good selection of different whiskeys and hard liquor on the menu. Definitely worth the visit every so often.",

The service can be a bit slow, the food is nothing special, maybe a little pricy for the kind of quality that they provide.I had tried the PS burger which tasted anything but nice, was rather ordinary and in my opinion the burgers from fastfood chains tasted even better. I got a pie as well which was average but really pricy for the portion that they served. \u00a0I decided to get a dessert to 'save' the meal and was not disappointed. I ordered one of the chocolate cakes and it had alot of filling and was huge, really chocolaty. The overall experience there wasn't satisfactory. The food was very overpriced for that quality and maybe this is one of the places that people should go only for their desserts and cakes.",

    "text": "PS Cafe at Ann Siang Hill is my favourite of all the PS Cafes dotted around town and one of the main reasons is that it admits adults and teenagers only. It is a joy to be able to dine in peace without screaming children running around. Food : The chargrilled cheeseburger here is massive. A large thick chargrilled patty of wagyu and US chuck topped with melting gruyere and mozzarella cheese, sauteed mushrooms and crispy onions on a toasted sesame bun complete with shoe string fries, it is a burger lover's dream come true. Well, maybe with the addition of bacon. We really liked the crab tart served with prawn bisque cream and lemon honey vinaigrette and harissa, but the laksa leaf pesto pasta was a bit of a let down. The Canadians at our table raved about the poutine but I thought it was a bit heavy and much prefer the truffle shoe string fries. Love the blackforest profiteroles!Ambience : Love it! The concept at the various PS Cafe outlets are all somewhat different, and my favourite is the one at ASH. It's got a very Mad Men feel to it, dark wood paneling, even a bar on the roof to chill out Service : Efficient and reasonably pleasantPrices are a tad steep but I'd go back for the crab tart.",

    "text": "It had been one of those days in the office, we were hungry and had a thirst for something that water couldn't quench...We headed to Ang Siang Hill as we had some out of towners in our group and it's a great area with a good choice of bars and restraurants. The shophouses give it a distinctly heritage feel but with a new fresh edge to it with buzzing bars.Given the haze situation we decided on PS. Caf\u00e9 as a an indoor location safe from the ever increasing PSI daily count that we have all become so aware of here.We climbed the tree lined steps up to the main entrance noticing the respectful sign at the door informing us children were not allowed. For us this was a positive bonus after a day in the office and we proceeded inside. Once there, we were greeted by polite staff who informed us they didn't have a table for us at the moment, but we were welcome to take a seat at the bar and they would find us a table in about 15-20mins.The downstairs bar area had a nice relaxed feel and we soon were sipping from a good selection of wine, beers and cocktails. In about 10mins the staff brought us up to the first floor where we were seated for dinner The low level table lighting, the relaxed music all helped to ensure we felt relaxed and welcome.The menu selection is good, which proved difficult for a few of us to narrow down our selections from as our decision making skills were a little washed out at this stage of the evening. We choose some calamari and crab cakes to share as an appetiser and I choose the Flamed Prawn.The calamari was fresh and crisp and the delicious sticky sauce it was served with gave us an interesting guessing game for the ingredients, our summary was honey, soy sauce and star anise but I would love to know if anyone knows the answer for sure! The Flamed Prawns were perfectly cooked and the sauce has the right balance of creaminess and spice without being over powering for the delicate flavour of the prawns. The rest of our party choose the burgers and a chicken parmigiano which smelt absolutely divine, and judging by the speed everything was polished off we were a happy bunch at the end of it.But perhaps once of PS. Caf\u00e9's strongest forte's is their deserts, being a keen baker I fell in love with the old fashioned glass cake stands with chalk boards next to each one, they were a great range of traditional and some interesting fusions (lime, ginger and butterscotch as one example). We chose a selection of a grand chocolate cake, a carrot and ginger cake and the key lime pie. They were all freshly baked with very generous serving portions that we found ourselves egging each other on to finish. A task we actually just couldn't manage but we left feeling full and relaxed after unwinding over a good dinner, some delicious desserts and that thirst I mentioned at the beginning? That was definitely quenched over some good wine.I'd recommend this for a catch up with friends, a romantic dinner, or as we found it, a good place to bring out of town visitors.",
