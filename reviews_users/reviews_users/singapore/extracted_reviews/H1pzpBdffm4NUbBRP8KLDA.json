    "text": "Argh this place. I don't get it at all. There are horrendous queues for dim sum lunch because they don't take reservations, and we queued for about 20 mins on a public holiday Monday (2 of us).You don't always get what you want because you have to wait for the trolleys to roll past you, and then you flag em down and get what you want. Some of the trolley ladies don't holler out their wares, so you're gonna have to ask what they're hawking. I tried practically everything less the congee, and I have to say I am not impressed with the food. The rice rolls- argh. Too salty and dark a sauce. The siew Mai, forget it. The prawn dumplings had skin that was too thick and prawns within were unremarkable. The egg tarts had uneven levels of egg, and was really soso. I also tried the banana prawn fritter, and the skin was probably fried at the wrong temperature because it was oil-soaked yet not very crispy. The spring roll was dripping oil from it's too-thick skin. They also ruined my favorite dimsum item, the liu sha bao(custard bun), where \u00a0the bun was filled with a flowing custard that tasted of freezer burn! Other failures include the char siew bun, which had very little filling, was cold despite being in a steaming cart, and was awfully sweet. Just... weird. I don't know how this place survives. I don't care about the deco, I want my food. It cost about $50+ for two, but I feel it wasn't worth it at all. It was too expensive for what it was.",

    "text": "A distant relative suggested this place since my #1 criterion for a place to eat is there must be air-conditioning. I can't fault him since this is probably the only place that opens for dim sum at 8.30am. When he first said \"Red Star\", I was like \"Red what??\" I have never heard of Red Star despite I was born and raised in Singapore. Personally I believe if it was any good, my dad would have brought us there when we were kids. Notice I used the \"was\". I yelped the restaurant and had already prepped myself with the 1970s decor. I didn't expect it was so bad until I seen it with my own eyes. It was dingy and tacky. The location of this restaurant was not the easiest to find until you arrived at the building. Saw a sign indicating Red Star is located on the 7th floor. There was an elevator next to it, I was horrified when I entered it. When the elevator door opened on the 7th, I had no words. After following the signs, finally got into the restaurant. Yes, the decor was stuck in the 1970s, but I still can deal with it. After we got seated, the male staff asked what kind of tea we would like. His mannerism started from indifferent to rude.I looked around at the table setting in front of me. My plate was greasy. My bowl was dirty and so was the soup spoon. By this time the male staff came with a pot of tea and a metal bin of cups lying in there. He just left them on the table and walked away. And yes, the tea cup I pulled out from that metal bin was dirty too. Anyway, guess we would have to pour our own tea. Then came the highlight which was the dim sum.This restaurant has probably the worst dim sum I have ever eaten in Singapore. Honestly I never have awful dim sum in Singapore, this special award really goes to Red Star.Just to highlight a few items : 1) Siew Mai (pork dumpling) - F - it looked unappetizing, there was no flavor to it, the meat tasted weird2) Cheong Fun with BBQ pork - F - zero flavor, and the BBQ pork tasted weird too3) Egg tart - F - it was fresh from the oven, but the crust too dry and the custard part has no tasteAnother female staff was so rude when my relative asked if there was any egg tart. She basically said if it was ready, it would already be out.Rude service, awful food and overpriced for this kind of dim sum someone actually has the guts to serve to patrons. \u00a0I say those who like the food here do not know any better. It doesn't matter this place has been around for a very long time, things that are old are not necessarily good.And not to mention, the air conditioning was almost non existent here. Any self-respecting Cantonese will never give this place any star beyond 2. I chose a 1 or none.",

    "text": "This place - WOW. While dim sum here isn't the best you can get in Singapore, the entire dining experience here make up for it. To be honest, I've never heard of this place before until a group of friends talked about it and decided to bring me here for lunch last weekend. \u00a0Red Star is located on the 7th floor of a HDB flat (Block 54) within the Outram neighborhood. The restaurant is super retro - dim lighting, a center stage (for wedding singer or sort) and a huge main dining hall. The dining hall is filled with tables and chairs arranged in the most compact way to maximize the space, a common sight in any chinese restaurant. \u00a0We learnt that there are 2 ways to come up to the restaurant - one through the main door and another through the kitchen (back door). I think GOD knows that we're a curious bunch, the elevator we took lead us to the back entrance of the restaurant. We walked pass the kitchen, an oily walkway, through a few peculiar looking doors that says \"RED STAR THIS WAY\" before reaching the main dining hall. And then we saw the main entrance on the other side with people already queuing up trying to get a table during the peak brunch period. Lucky for us, another friend was there much earlier and already got a table when we reached. Service here is world class. Middle aged ladies with their headgear (like Emirates airlines) graciously push their cart to your table recommending and introducing different dim sums available for the day. They speak fluent cantonese and limited english but good enough to understand if you have any visitors or caucasian friend who cant understand mandarin or cantonese. I \"interviewed\" a couple of them and learned that they have been working here for the past 20+ years and take pride on their job. And with that I truly understand now that despite the average food, people still come back for its exceptional service as well as comfort food that's friendly to the wallet too. \u00a0Red Star is no where near any of the \"finer\" dim sum outlets we get in Takashimaya or 5 star hotels, but if you're looking for something different with a local touch, unpretentious, where you can talk and laugh as loud as you can then this place might be the right choice. I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Familiar food. Familiar service. In an ever changing Singapore where every old thing make way for new, this little corner of history seems forgotten. I am not too young to find the place smell of old people, neither too old to find this place reminiscence.Food. It seems time essentially kept the food tasting great \"just like old times\"; both a compliment and a tinge of sarcasm. Compliment becos it still gives us a wonderful memory of the old HK dim sum taste like, and yet when the quality and evolving tastes has improved, this place has not. I am sure many of the customers have tasted better and more exquisite dim sum in HK and Singapore. But where can you find such reminiscence in this present day? Surely you can afford to pay for some historicity!Service. When compared to the other food places this has an army of people watching over our shoulders offering us the multitude of dim sum choices and the time to explain how each of them is special. Truely an experience only found in an old HK restaurant.The teacups came in a pot of hot water, just like old times. The pushers ( the people pushing the carts) is more varied; both old and young. It's not fair to keep those ladies working over 20 plus years thou some of them still do.New dishes. Apparently, they do add new varieties of dim sum, and have quite a number of \"newer\" deserts in their carts, those you can find everywhere else. They taste just like everywhere else so these I am not impressed! No historicity.Price. A bit pricey since we are paying for some historicity here, especially when you get to taste some of the old unchanged flavours dim sum in a old HK setting. Food is average. If you can get the ambiance and the historicity like me, those are the stars. If you want better food and a nicer modern ambiance with more cute looking or younger service people, leave the Q.Oh... The fragrance. I have to say something about the smell of food when I came thru the door. Suddenly I am reminded of the HK restaurant back in 1990 when I first met my HK in-laws! Yes. It was both pleasant and scary at the same time.",

No reservations required for dinner. It was kinda awkward because it was a really huge restaurant (100 pax) and we had it all to ourselves. They stop serving Dim Sums after 3pm. We were very disappointed but made do with what we had. We didn't want to be rude and walk off since we were majority of the customers they had last night... so we ordered...The food 1. Fried bean curd & broccoli - LOVE it. The bean curd was so soft and silky. The dish was drizzle with sauce made out of crab meat and egg. 2. Prawns and cereal - LOVE it. Probably one of the best cereal prawns I had in awhile. The cereal was amazing. Can't quite put a finger to it but we ate every crumb. Another winning point was that the prawn was already de-shelled :) 3. Roasted chicken - Ok. A bit dry as most Chinese roast chicken are ... but its skin was crispy on the outside. 4. Crispy noodles & seafood - Ok. The noodles weren't very crispy by the time we had it. I would have ask for the sauce separately for this dish. \u00a05. Omelette - Meh - Oily, greasy & not very tasty. Pass!Service - Super Fast! of course, there weren't many tables...except us.",

The pineapple buns actually had pieces of pineapples in them -- not that I would have minded it if the buns had tasted better. The kailan was drowned in some cold, nondescript, greasy goo. \u00a0As to the atmosphere, imagine an old Chinatown restaurant that is vast and dark, with nothing done to its deco since perhaps the 1970s.

Apart from the tacky 60's d\u00e9cor and how they still serve their dim sums in pushcarts, that's where the similarities end with restaurants in Hong Kong as I feel their dim sum is overpriced and severely lacking in quality. \u00a0However, if you're going there not for dim sum but to enjoy the wide variety of Cantonese dishes on offer, then it's a different story. Be sure to try the US roast duck, shark's fin with crab meat, fried garoupa in tomato sauce and their butter prawns, amongst some of their best offerings on the menu.",

One thing I dislike about Red Star is how inconveniently it is located, and forces me to make a morning trek just to get to the restaurant! But all the better since it does make the food taste like victory! Be sure to arrive early since they don't take reservations for daily operations, and is one a first come first serve basis. There is usually a long queue that stretches all the way to the lift landing, so don't make the same mistake as I did, and arrive with a starving stomach, you won't be able to resist over ordering! \u00a0My staple dim sum dishes would be their fluffy egg tarts which are crisp around the edges and a soft pale yellow in the middle that looks healthy and non-artificial. The usual accompanying dishes would be siew mai, prawn dumplings with huge whole fresh prawns, and chicken feet if you can handle it! Their service really brings us back to the old days, where there are dozens of little Cantonese ladies pushing carts filled with goodies, going round table by table to serve you. If the food is not to your taste, at least it will be a morning filled with interesting conversations with these feisty ladies!",

The people behind Red Star are also a part of the Heavenly Kings quartet, the four-some who redefined Chinese food in SIngapore (and some say Malaysia), by creating and inventing some of the dishes we now take for granted, like the yam ring and even the Chinese New Year yu sheng. It's a massive hall where people -- lots of people, and sometimes the occasional celebrity -- jostle for seats from the moment their doors open, especially on weekends. The stage that tells you you shouldn't attempt singing, on which so many of our parents' friends got married. The gaudy tablecloth. The dimsum trolleys.The food isn't great anymore.Especially considering the shift towards 'fine' dimsum, ordered off menus in restaurants far higher end than this.There's a tendency to automatically class this as \"kopitiam dimsum\" because it isn't the super refined Cantonese-style dimsum we've all gotten used to, and therefore say this isn't good.But it's still good. Especially considering how little you're paying for this, how authentically old school everything on the menu is, and what a funny, awesome, nostalgic experience it is to eat here each time. There was a period in 2010 or so when the food standard declined dramatically to the point of inedible, yes, but I'm glad to say that these old farts are back and their hargow and roast meats can out-heritage, if not out-class, all the wussy Crystal Jades and Imperial Treasures of the world.",

    "text": "This restaurant used to be a popular place for Dim Sum amongst my parent's generation. As a kid, I enjoyed the fantastic delicacies they had. We stopped going there for a couple of years and my recent visit to Red Star was pretty disappointing. While the restaurant's age is showing through the dated decor, the old fashioned carts being pushed around by aunties serving Dim Sum still gives the place a nostalgic charm. The food, however, is no where near the standard of what it used to be. While the char siew sou is still pretty good with its buttery and flaky pastry with a moist, flavourful char siew centre, the rest of the Dim Sum we ordered did not impress. The standard of their pau (steamed buns) have dropped and the buns we got were rather stretchy and had a slight alkaline aftertaste. The siu mai just did not work for me. We ended up ordering congee to fill our tummies as we sort of lost faith in the dim sum there.",

    "text": "I have been to Red Star twice. It was recommended by a local friend. \u00a0They served more dishes on the cart on weekends. We anticipated good dim sum due to the long line. We were totally disappointed with the food and the service. It is a traditional Chinese restaurant with traditional CHINESE service - rude and no manners. The food was terrible. So, I thought the staff were busy on weekends therefore provided bad service. My parents were visiting, so I brought them there on a weekday and get a second opinion. My parents did not enjoy the food, every dish was lousy. There were very few choices to choose from. THe worse part was, the servers were very political. THey condemned each other. When I wanted to order some fried dishes, this server said, \"It is not my department. You have to ask that lady. That lady is very grumpy. Don't order the fried stuff, they are not good.\" in Mandarin. I got to walk to that lady to get her to come to our table. She was not serving any customer yet she was impatient while my parents making choices. In conclusion, we never went back there since 7 months ago. I will not recommend to anyone.",
