    "text": "So yummy! Ultra delicious soup, quality ingredients and good service. Definitely worth a visit or rather multiple visits!!This is my first visit to Hai Di Lao. We were seated promptly as we had a reservations made for 16 pax. So I did not have the opportunity to experience their free manicure station, fruit juice bar and snack bar. Most are complimentary for guests waiting for their tables, based on my friends, they mentioned waiting time average around 1-2 hours.We were given a private room, and each individual's gets to have a personal pot to themselves. Most steamboat offer a communal pot.We use their iPad to place our orders and had a personal server who most wait on us. She made sure everything is in order and arrive promptly, she was super detailed and polite. we absolutely love her, service is awesome here!! I ordered a chicken soup base. It was SO SO good. The best I ever had!! My friends ordered tomato base and ma la base, they were really good too. Food was really fresh and everything taste fabulous. I wish I can give them 10 stars, they are that good - well, also because I didn't have to wait. I might drop the star ratings if I were made to wait for over 2 hours.",

    "text": "First of all, their service is really one of excellence. Many restaurants should take a leaf or two from them to really enhance diners experience. Secondly, their food items are really fresh and appetizing. I would like to specially mention the pork balls. They don't have the porky taste and each bite is QQ and full of flavour! Super win! I usually don't enjoy eating meatballs because so many people kill it for me. Their pork balls is currently my top ranking ones in terms of taste and texture! We chose the herbal black chicken soup base and their signature mala spicy soup base. I requested for really low level of spice as I don't know what to expect. Turned out it still packed quite a punch though it's low spice level. Their chicken soup is white and full of flavour. Even without anything in it, I could have drank bowls and bowls of it already! And to give them credit for using REAL stock, I didn't feel thirsty even after me drinking a lot of soup by the end of the meal. Dessert and condiments counter, we opted for this at an additional $4 per pax but to me, it's really worth it. Not only I can mix my own dipping sauce the way I like it, there is a nice selection of fruits and Chinese desserts. Today, they had rock melon and watermelon which were nice and sweet. As for the Chinese desserts, I enjoyed their chilled Beancurd and white fungus especially. All in all an excellent meal! Totally satisfied and already planning when to return again. Surely a sign of an excellent restaurant!",

    "text": "Everyone mentioned how Hai Di Lao is known for their service, but I do not think it is that extraordinary so I have no idea what is the baseline for comparison. I think the staff is cordial and efficient. The only difference is they will hand you a hot towel once seated to clean your hands? They also offer aprons and cloth to cover your bags on the chair. As reservations can be made for lunch, we didn't have to wait for a table and make use of their manicure services and fruits refreshment. You are given a tablet to order your food. Somehow ours was set to the Chinese language and unfortunately most of us could not read it and order. Finally a friend who can read it found there was an option to switch to English (upper right corner). They should consider putting \"ENG\" or something when the menu was in Chinese mode and in Chinese characters when in English mode so the monolingual can select the language option. Alternatively you can also flag down a wait staff for assistance. The food is good. Fresh and appetizing and of better quality. I did not expect cod in the seafood platter. The soup is also tasty and the Szechuan spicy soup (mala) is actually drinkable. It did get spicier after a while. Take out the chili to reduce the spice level or ask to top up the soup to dilute the spiciness. The chicken soup is delicious too. I am also surprised the cost is lower than expected. I thought it would be similar to Imperial Treasure Steamboat pricing (about $100+ for 2) but it turned out quite reasonable. Maybe it depends on what we ordered too. For a table of 5 girls, it came to around $140. We had a seafood platter, slice beef, beef balls, mushroom platter and vegetable platter. We did not add the self service free flow seasoning for $4++ each as we did not fancy the desserts or fruits. We were full with what we had, with room for dessert elsewhere.This is a comfortable place for hotpot but it is very crowded and so it is very noisy too. I still prefer to have steamboat at home but I will not mind returning if since reservations can be made. No way will I queue for this though. The usual wait time is about 2 hours or more. Another slightly cheaper option with equally fresh and good food will be Shi Li Fang at Orchard Central and Icon Village.",

    "text": "Have been hearing Singaporean friends rave about HDL so when I was in SG for the weekend, decided to check what the fuss is all about. Amazed that the waiting time can stretch up to 2-3 hours! But they try to make it less painful by offering free food, drinks, even manicures if you choose to wait. Instead we went window shopping and came back when we anticipated the table might be ready. We still had to wait about 20 mins despite being told our number was next in line. Can kill time by folding paper cranes to redeem a $6 dish haha. After being shown to our seats, we were offered a ziplock bag for our phones, aprons to cover our clothes etc. Thoughtful indeed. Ordered the ingredients we wanted over an ipad, and half portions were available. Our waitress helped us concoct a dipping sauce and also helped cooked some of the ingredients. I even saw her peeling prawns for the next table. Hot towels are also given for us to freshen up. Service indeed is one of the commendable highlights here. So now let's talk about the food. The tomato broth is indeed one of the yummiest soups they have offered. A slight sweetness that goes well with most of the ingredients. Also had the Szechuan mala one which I sometimes mixed with the tomato soup in my own bowl for that wonderful pairing. Appreciated the fresh seafood pastes (prawn, squid etc) and meat balls. At least the more premium pricing is justified by the fresh, non-processed ingredients. Also was treated to live noodle making show. After the yummy steamboat, there are still fresh fruits, sweet chinese tong sui and ice cream if you must have something sweet to end the meal. Pricing was about $50/pax which is a bit high for us tourists, but I think you pay what you get and this is a place definitely worth trying at least once! Go for the 4 soup option then haha. The only thing making me think twice is the waiting time.... but I did hear that they open until 3 or 5 am.... so supper option maybe?",

You can do your nails, snack on popcorn (fresh from the popcorn machine), and leave your loud ass kids in the play pen while you wait for your table haha. The place stays open forever too. Come around 1am-2am, and you'll witness the shift in demo from the afternoon family crowd. Prices are on the higher end, but worth it especially in a group of 6 (it's the magic #). Try to get reservations or go at odd hours -wait is impossibly long otherwise. FOOD (must tries): - chicken herbal & mala soup base- hand pulled noodles - dumplings - homemade tofuSERVICE: - good (some servers don't speak english well) COST: - around $50-$70 / personOVERALL: - recommend for groups - great for late night- be ready to poop fire",

You're definitely the best hot pot restaurant in the world, if not the universe. \u00a0I was first introduced to you in Shanghai, and during my recent trip to Asia, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that you are in Singapore also! The Ma La Tang broth is undoubtedly mouth numbing but oh so addictive. \u00a0The sauce bar is perfectly set up for a delicious concoction. \u00a0And when I merged my personal sauce creation with freshly boiled meats and vegetables, it was the perfect marriage of umami flavors in my mouth.One of my favorite dishes is the Kung foo noodles, where a talented noodle artist came to my table and made fresh noodles right in front of my eyes. \u00a0People will have to check out his moves in person. \u00a0And to top it off, the noodles were delicious! I recently discovered that you have a sister chain here in LA also. Excited that I don't have to travel to Asia just to get my HDL hot pot fix!",

I decided that next time i will just order half portions for the ingredients; HDL's portions are actually quite big in comparison to other steamboat places so beware if you are more of a variety type of person and not too concern over quantity. the only downside of my entire experience was that i didn't know how to fold a paper crane so i couldn't get the free $6 dish. what dish is it you ask? it remains a mystery. next time when i go there again and if i manage to either solve the rubix cube or fold a paper crane then I'll update this review.",

    "text": "Probably my favourite chinese restaurant in Singapore. I'm a huge fan of steamboat, and since this branch opened, I've been making reservations here and rounding up the family to head there regularly! Everyone knows the service here is top-notch (hot towels, popcorn & herbal tea & fruits & manicures while you wait, ziploc bags for phones, aprons, hairties, etc), but I wouldn't come here if not for the amazing amazing food. For steamboat the broth is paramount and basically defines your meal. And the broth here has been consistently good. I always order the ma la with either the mushroom (they call it San Xian) or black chicken soup. No steamboat restaurant has the same reverence for and focus on the soup: it's served to drink alone with parsley and spring onion before you even add any ingredients, and on its own, it's already so addictive. It comes with ingredients too - actual black chicken, and two types of mushrooms & fishballs for the mushroom one. I am a huge fan of ma la tang, and the one here is tasty in itself, even after I scoop out most of the chili oil. It's actually drinkable !!!The dishes here are also fresh and inventive. You can order half or full portions - we usually order half portions and add on later if we like the dish. My faves: -Noodles - freshly spun and cut at your table. A rather small portion though, so order more if you'd like to enjoy more of this silky soft handmade la mian. -Pork and chives dumplings - YUM. Too many steamboat places are sloppy on their dumplings. The filling is fresh and juicy, while the skin tastes just like mee hoon kueh / like the la mian. Delicious. -Fish glue - my family loves this. It tastes very distinctly of fresh prawn here, compared to other places where it may taste more like fish or fish cake. -Meats like U.S. beef and black pork - thinly sliced and delicious on its own, even cooked in lighter soups like chicken/mushroom soup. The portions are not that large though, so savor them! -Meatballs - none of that tasteless frozen synthetic junk here. Tastes just like fresh meat. I'm also addicted to their chilled beancurd, served along with their sauces and condiments ($4 each). I'd usually balk at paying for this at some other steamboat restaurants but never hesitate at Hai Di Lao: besides the chilled beancurd (which is impossibly fine and soft and light and delicious and I eat maybe 5 portions each time), there're a few traditional cold dishes like peanuts and beancurd skin, fresh and actually very ripe fruits like watermelon and cut oranges, and a ridiculous display of sauces. Tbh I don't know why someone would have Korean gochujang or fermented beancurd sauce with steamboat...but definitely impressive variety. I feel like I need to say something bad about Hai Di Lao after raving for so long...so let me rack my head. Okay, it was a bit of a pain to make reservations because the line is often busy and can't get through. But just keep calling and make them, because you don't want to watch hungrily outside for 2 hours. I've never waited. This usually means I make reservations a few days or a week ahead. Of course Hai Di Lao is pricier than the usual run-of-the-mill steamboat restaurant. Orders of two types of broth already totals to more than $20 for the table. But it's not meant to compete with more casual places - Hai Di Lao offers a relaxed, quieter, more formal ambiance, where you can leisurely cook and sip at your soup and chat while enjoying your meal. IMO that's worth paying for occasionally, and frequently if you can afford it!",

    "text": "This is actually the 2nd branch of the well known \u6d77\u5e95\u635e chain from China. They are pretty known for their service and quality of food. The service staff is generally very courteous and attentive. The usual practice is that after the soup boils, the service staff will offer to pour out some soup and add some gsrnishing for you before you actually cook your food. If you have trouble with the menu they will be more than willing to help you out. Also when you do order prawns, they will check if you'd like them to remove the shells for you and if you would like to have the prawn heads in the soup. I would say that the 313 branch is slightly less crowded and easier to get a table. They now have a new concept of small individual pot as an alternative to having one big pot with 2 separate soups. Price wise, it's slightly higher as they do provide more than just food, free manicure session for the ladies if you have to wait very long for a table and a kids playing area.",
