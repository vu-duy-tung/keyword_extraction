    "text": "Located at the ground floor of Orchard Forum is insta-worthy Hana Japanese Restaurant. Famed for it's flying Japanese noodles, it has now added a refreshing new authentic Japanese menu.PREMIUM SNOW BOWL $49.00Lets start off with the ingredients : Engawa, Minced Otoro, Uni, Snow Crab Leg, Ikura Roe, Tamago. This bowl is so drool worthy! I couldn't help but imagine the juicy sensation of the Ikura Roe popping in my mouth. The minced otoro had a melt in your mouth texture. The Engawa is a very interesting fish texture, gently glazed with the blow-torch, it is extremely flavourful and delicate.The uni is generously served and though this portion looks good for 2, I'm not willing to share any uni!! It's all mine! The freshness of the seafood here is incredible, matched with friendly service, who are willing to explain the ingredients.\"MAKE YOUR OWN\" MAKI ROLL SUSHI PLATTER REGULAR $39.00/ PREMIUM $59.00/ COOKED $39.00Here's another fun and interesting menu item, how about \"making\" your own sushi? Each set comes with free flow Sushi Rice & Seaweed. Here's a mixed platter and you can choose what you want in your sushi!Here's my open-faced sushi, with my favourite ingredients, salmon sashimi and ikura roe, along with a portion of sushi rice. The seaweed is extremely fresh and crisp in texture.DREAM CATCHER $25.00Here's a mix of mocktail and a cocktail, made with Green Apple & Passion Fruit Base with the option of Rum. Truly a sight to behold.SCIENCE EXPERIMENT $25.00Want to play more with your drinks, try the Science Experiment out, made with \u00a0Litchi & Apple Base or Vodka/ Rum.

    "text": "Before coming to Singapore.. my girlfriend showed me a pic of the flying noodles offered here. Super awesome gimmick to get people in. Spoiler Alert!!!.... the chopsticks are held up by a hidden stick under the noodles. The restaurant looked very clean. We were greeted right away and seated right away. Not to crowded for lunch on a Monday. The three of us just ordered the flying noodles since that was the reason we went there in the first place. Husband and I both ordered the Cha Soba noodles and my girlfriend ordered the Flying Salted Egg Yolk Udon.Cha Soba Noodles: This dish came with green Soba noodles with the japanese soy dipping sauce and a small side plate of spam sushi. It was good but expensive for something that is just soba noodles you can get anywhere. The only difference was this was a flying soba noodle. So honestly... its just good for photos but you're better off ordering the Salted Egg Yolk Udon.Flying Salted Egg Yolk Udon: Something completely different. My girlfriend ordered this and let me try it. Her dish was savory and delicious. A bit on the heavy side but it was different from things I normally eat or order. Better then I expected it to be. I expected hers to be really sweet but thankfully it wasn't. If you were to come here for the flying noodles... I highly recommended getting this dish.Even though this place is just ok.. prices are a little high. I'm glad I got to eat the flying noodles here since it started here. Recently a restaurant in the Los Angeles area started to offer \"flying noodles\" but it isn't the same if you don't have it in Singapore!",

    "text": "I truly appreciate this restaurant and believe the sushi is excellent.This isn't a Ki-Sho or Ginza Sushi Ichi and they aren't aiming to be like that, rather this is a casual place you can go and enjoy yourself over good food and drinks. Many of their dishes and drinks are instagram worthy and you'll definitely see most everyone taking pictures of whatever is in front of them.The sushi rice is sweeter than what you'd find in normal Japanese spots as that is what more Singaporeans prefer (if they aren't splurging at expensive omakases).They have a great sake list and the service is wonderful. They also make their own umeshu and you'll notice a bunch of containers above the bar which is umeshu that is owned by different people that want to age their own umeshu and drink whenever they come back.Just do the 12 piece sushi omakases and chill out over a Born Gold sake.",

One of us ordered the flying noodle, another tried their beef bowl and i ordered the grilled fish. Flying noodle came, everyone was taking photo of it. After 5-10mins, finally we can taste it. The noodle was a little sweet taste, not much ingredient on it. Basically this noodle's selling point is just the 3D look. Suggestion is just try once for experience sake. Beef bowl came, but it was on a 'chopping board' bought from IKEA. It comes with a mini salad bowl and soup. Ingredient includes beef, egg, pickles, rice. Nothing much about it, but it is rather filling. Next is the grilled unagi. Very simply presented, taste is not bad like the standard japanese restaurant. Rice has to be ordered separately tho. Overall, it is good for chillaxing with friends. But not really worth the money for the food. 3 stars for HANA.",

To my horrors there was salmon sashimi, processed crab sticks and rice which didn't even taste like Japanese rice. I'm really curious if this was the \"premium\" version, what the cheaper version would consist of. Where are the premium ingredients like scallop? Or otoro? Or even one or two small pieces of uni? I really can't believe they put PROCESSED CRAB STICKS and still charged $60 a plate!!!??Even with the 1-1 voucher... The bill came up to $35 per person, it would still be too expensive for ingredients which were given. They were obviously very poorly staffed and the poor manager seemed to be running everywhere in a rush trying his best when it wasn't even crowded to begin with. I do applaud his effort, but this restaurant would not last much longer and I'm pretty sure of it. This place makes Sushi Tei seem like a 6Star \u00a0restaurant.1 Star - for effort from the managers part",
