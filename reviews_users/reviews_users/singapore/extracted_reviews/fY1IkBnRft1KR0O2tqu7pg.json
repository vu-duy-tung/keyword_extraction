All the more so as the price is very affordable price (less than 5SGD).However, I was a bit disappointed after the excellent reviews I read about it! The chicken was indeed not bad but there were little pieces of bones inside of it (I never had them in other chicken rice stalls I tried in Singapore) and the rice was not exceptional. I guess it was okay but I had better rice in other stalls, and it is still a big thing in that dish!So overall, it is a good place to eat but maybe not worth the long queue...",

On my trip to Singapore, I was determined to find one that is clearly better. After 5-6 restaurants and stands at hawker markets and food courts, I was starting to think that my go-to Hainan chicken rice restaurant in Los Angeles is as good as it was going to get (other than the fact that the price in LA is higher than that in Singapore). Luckily, I marked up Tian Tian, which is highly regarded by Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay, and made a point to come try this.WOW! The chicken was silky, clean-tasting yet flavorful. The rice smelled AMAZING and tasted even better. The red sauce added a special kick. My girlfriend and I devoured half of a chicken, and took 2 chicken rice plates to go! This is what Singapore is all about, and I can finally return home happy, knowing that the Hainan chicken in SE Asia is not \u00a0an unfortunate hype.",

I used to remember coming on particular days of the week (is it Monday) and the stall isn't even open at all! Seems like they dictate the terms where you guys can or cannot taste their chicken rice!Seems over-rated to me after all. I came down on a weekday evening and was pleasantly surprised that they were still open at around 8. Proceeded to order a plate... and it didn't come with soup. The chicken is a little tough as compared to those I've eaten at other places. The chili however, is absolutely delicious. Not to hot and sweet enough for my liking. I went back to take another helping of it. Oh I didn't see them providing dark soy sauce too.The rice is absolutely normal. There were some cucumber hidden beneath the chicken.The experience was underwhelming and I'm sure the other stalls around like Ah Tai are already biting at their heels in contending for Chicken Rice hegemony.",

When I first came to Singapore, my #1 to do was to eat chicken rice from Tian Tian and their stall in Maxwell food centre. I popped in real early as I wanted to beat the queue. As soon as the stall opened, I was first in line. I ordered the standard chicken rice set and after 1 minute of waiting, a serving of chicken, rice, soup and garlic chili sauce was waiting for me. After I found an empty table, I threw some garlic chili on top of my dish and dug in. The moment the mix of chili, rice and chicken hit my tongue was like ecstasy. It was as if I had lost my virginity all over again (okay, maybe not quite the same). Plenty of time has passed after my first time there, and I can proudly admit that I've eaten the chicken rice there at least 20 more times after that. Whenever I have visitors, I always make sure to take them to Tian and Tian and have them experience it for themselves. It's a must.",

While the rice is definitely soft and fragrant, the chicken was flavorless... and cold. I've never received chicken and rice in Singapore with cold chicken so assumed this was the specialty of Tian Tian, but aside from just being tender, there was nothing about the way this dish was served that marked it as something I'd come out of the way for. The second time I came here was out of my boyfriend's interest to try and had the exact same experience. Personally, definitely not worth the wait in the queue (although give it a try if you're lucky enough to not have to wait). I'd say you can very easily have a much better meal at another stall at Maxwell.",

There was a line that wraps around the corner when I first came and there still was a line after I finished eating. The chicken rice... hmmmm it wasn't fragrant at all! It was cold and hard. Not what I'd expect. Thumbs down on the rice for me... The chicken.... hmmm I found it to be course and dry in the breast area and the leg was nice and silky. I didn't mind it actually. But to claim as the best ... I doubt it... I've had so much better in Shenzhen and also in Melbourne. this is my experience only .. Give it a go still.. it may be different for you.. at least it is one to cross off the list.",

At the time, I was told that some stalls in Singapore recently gotten themselves a Michelin star and I was wondering if this was one of them (I checked, they don't have one...yet). I'm pretty sure that when we arrived at 1pm, we had at least 30 people in front of us. However, I must give them props for efficiency, it was far quicker than expected.We ordered Hainanese chicken rice, Beansprouts (taugeh) and Vegetables with oyster sauce. I think the reason why it is so famous is their absurdly fragrant rice! The sauce on the hainanese chicken is really good too! On top of that, the hainanese chili sauce is really very good!If you have time, want a decent hainanese chicken rice, come here. However, please don't be too overdressed, it gets kind of hot in this food court.",

This unassuming food stand that seems to always have a line wrapping around the corner at Maxwell is it. The rice is so flavorful that I can eat two bowls and still want more. I'm not a fan of white meat due to typical dryness, but when they ran out of chicken drumstick/leg, I had to settle for breast. And to my surprise, the white breast meat was tender and juicy. The chicken skin is super smooth and silky. I usually don't eat chicken skin, but I just couldn't help myself. During my short two days visit, this is the only thing I ate more than once. So, this place is legit.",

I ordered:Chicken and rice: while the chicken was moist, I think that I like the rice even more: very, very fragrant chicken smell and tasteBok Choy in oyster sauce: while this was good, it was actually more expensive than the chicken and rice itself. Next time, I would skip the veggies and fill up with other good food in this centre.Overall, Tian Tian met my expectations, but I wouldn't say that I was blown away.

Still if you're in Maxwell Road market during off peak hours, it's worth trying Tian Tian if the line isn't long. I jumped into the line when I noticed it was just a couple of folks on a weekday at around 3pm. That's when I noticed they had receipts with them. I obviously missed something. It did indeed turn out to be too good to be true. Tian Tian's recent notoriety has enabled them to take over the stall next door solely for taking orders and handling payment so customers move assembly-line style down to the next stall to receive their order. It's efficient but not very friendly. The rice is the star - fragrant and flavorful. The chicken is really moist and works well with the chili sauce. Thick soy sauce is available too but you have to request it which you should. All in all, pretty stellar chicken rice.",

But its all true, there is no overhype. Tian Tian definitely lives up to all the hype. The chicken plate for $4 is amazing. I've never had chicken so juicy and tender and flavorful. Just from looking at it, you can see the plumpness of the chicken meat! You can actually taste the flavor of chicken. I didn't even use the sauces as the chicken itself is the star. I didn't want any sauce to takeaway from the star of the show. I really wish LA could get their hainan chicken act together, even something half as good as tian tian would be nice to have. And the rice is just heavenly. Rice itself is perfectly cooked: light and fluffy. The flavors of chicken have immersed itself into each grain of rice. Eaten together with the chicken, its like a party in your mouth. I went on a weekday around 2pm, so the line definitely died down. Waited about 10 minutes before I ordered, and another couple minutes to grab the plate of food. After you get your chicken, you can grab a drink at one of the juice stalls in the area (there's one directly across from tian tian). I'm salivating just writing this review. I want some Tian Tian hainan chicken rice!!",

I think to achieve the perfect chicken rice dish, both the chicken and rice must be excellent, and I've had many plates from many places that serves either perfect chicken or perfect rice. This stall serves the most fragrant rice which is moist and flavorful, and coupled with the chilli sauce, is exceptional. The chicken is very tasty, and very tender. Definitely a number 1 stop for tourists and locals (if you haven't tried it).",

The rice - Good rice, but I've also had better. \u00a0There is a chicken rice stall in the Redhill Food Centre which I think has better rice and better chili although the quality of the chicken meat isn't as nice. \u00a0I also think that Ah Tai (the competitor to Tian Tian and also run by the ex-chef from Tian Tian) is overall a better stall. \u00a0Try Ah Tai before you make your decision on which is the best.",

I visited Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice at 3.30 pm on a weekday and was surprised that there was a queue. Looks like this stall is certainty famous.First of all, let's talk about the rice. The rice was fragrant and flavourful. However, not all the grains of the rice were soft. Some stuck together and were hard.The chicken drizzled in a 'special' sauce mixed by Tian Tian was amazingly tender, fleshy and tasty. I also tried the chilli sauce, and it was delicious! Together with the chicken, it definitely brings the taste up to a whole new level.Overall, Tian Tian definitely serves up one of the best chicken rice in Singapore, but if you're not a fan of queuing, better think twice about coming here especially during the peak mealtimes.",

Tian Tian was recommended to me by a Singaporean-Malaysian-Chinese friend from the states who had visited before. This was also my first time trying Hainanese Chicken rice. I was impressed to say the least. Lemme just say, this place is hyped up but it's for a reason. This is a ~no-frills, order at the counter, sit down in the Singapore humidity~ and eat type of establishment. When we approached the stall, there was already a small line formed. First, you pay for your order then you wait as it's assembled. \u00a0I waited for about 10 minutes before receiving my food. I ordered a medium sized chicken rice, with the soy sauce and the spicy sauce. It.Was.INCREDIBLE. The chicken was perfect. I'm a big fan of big flavor, and I was a little surprised that boiled chicken would be so good. I mixed with the thickened soya sauce and it was heaven. The rice was fluffy and in the words of Anthony Bourdain \"absolutely fragrant.\" and the cucumbers added perfect, refreshing crunch. I was STARVING on this day, and I just had to go back for seconds. I ordered myself a small size chicken rice this time, the cooks at the counter chuckled and said \"back for more?\" I said \"Its so good, can't stay away.\" They had a hoot and I left absolutely satisfied.** As a tip; the small and medium sized are pretty much exactly the same. So save yourself a couple of SGD and order a small! You'll get the same amount. ** This place is delicious. An absolute can't miss in Singapore. Boy, wish we had this back in the States.",

The chicken was steamed nicely, soft and succulent and the rice was fragrant and tasty. Because it is in a Hawker Centre, be prepared for the Hawker ambiance. No air condition, crowded, share tables and long queues. But worth it to try the chicken rice!",

Though, I have to say there were about 20 people ahead of me in the queue and majority of them where Singaporeans, so it can't be that bad, right? It's boiled chicken; honestly I think it's a cooking style that won't suit a lot of Westerners. It's more about textures rather than flavors. I ordered a large and it came with its own plate of rice. The chicken was lean with a bit of fat and the meat overall was soft and juicy. The skin was very silky and went well with the rice. Under was a layer of cucumbers, which to me was pointless.The highlight was the rice! Superbly fragrant, a little oily and I could taste the ginger and garlic.Chicken rice is Singapore's national dish, so it's worth trying at least once even if it's not Tian Tian's version!",

Is it the best food under the roof...or just the spot a someone made famous???....get in there and find out for yourself.I personally loved the dish. It was quickly prepared, very affordable (cheap) and most importantly...delicious! We got the simple \"Chicken Rice\". It comes with fresh cut chicken, atop well cooked rice, with some cucumber slices and a spicy side of sauce (and i do mean spicy!!). The dish was simple and the flavors were not over the top (save that sauce) but it really appeals to the palate. Add the sauce for a fiery kick! If you find yourself in Singapore...make the hike to this spot to try the dish of the country.",

    "text": "Amid the sea of hawker stalls that make up the Maxwell Road Food Center, one stands out to even the casual observer. It alone has a line/queue. Apparantely Tian Tian has people waiting for its food virtually all the time. I visited during what I thought would be a between-meal lull in foot traffic, around 4PM, and sure enough there were still about 10 people waiting ahead of me. No other stall in the Center had a queue.The reason is obvious after you taste their Chicken Rice. How they infuse so much flavor into the chicken meat from a boiling/steaming cooking process is remarkable. The bowl of clear broth that comes with it has a similar flavor and is quite nice. The \"Vegetable with Oyster Sauce\" dish that I also ordered was surprising delicious: baby bok choy infused with thse same wonderful flavors found in the chicken. And all of it came to a little over S$6.00 (US$5.00) for food quality that many much more expensive Asian restuarants can't match.[A hint for fellow tourists: hawker stalls like this don't provide napkins, and to use the wash rooms to clean up will cost you ten cents (exact change helps). Also Tian Tian doesn't sell beverages. For something with an Asian flair that's easily accessible to everyone's palate I recommend the sugar cane juice from the stall directly across from Tian Tian].",

Likely, If I were showing guests around since this restaurant has gained popularity because of Bourdain and that's why people want to try it out. Chicken was moist and flavorful as people say. Rice had good flavor as well. The sauce provided was good but I like the chicken rice meal on its own. $3.50 for a small. If you're with a group, order a whole or half and share. I'd say that other places are just as good without the hype. Also, then you don't have a wait even though this line at Tian Tian moves give or take quickly. Tip: have your $ ready because they try to hurry you along Tip2: expect a line and to wait at least a little",

Came here with a couple of friends and we went super early before opening time to avoid the long lines.Place opened roughly around 10am, but do be prepared to wait in a line since this place is pretty popular among the locals and tourists. Wait time for the food wasn't too long and the portion amount was decent.Overall, the chicken rice wasn't mind blowing, but rather, it was a tasty dish. The rice was quite flavorful and fragrant and the chicken was soft and tender. I definitely like the house made chili that definitely had a lot of zing and spicy to it.Still haven't figured out why there is such a craze for this dish but it's worth the try if you like chicken rice. Also, I noticed that a lot of other competing chicken rice stalls have a similar look to Tian Tian, so do check the names before waiting in line if you're looking for the \"famous\" chicken rice place (aka Tian Tian). Another recommendation I have is if you're in a group, have one person make the order for everyone. Saves time and it does make the line shorter ;)",

The chicken is juicy and flavorful and I really loved the light sauce on it, which had an amazing taste. The rice is fluffy and lightly tasty. I didn't really love the soy sauce/ chili sauce to add on top, so adding those did mess up the dish a little for me but didnt' change how amazing the chicken was. It's simple and lovely and perfectly cooked - a must-have dish when you're in SG.",

They give you a choice between the small & large place, but by the looks of my large plate, the small one must be meant for a mouse!Overall, great local food (even if it doesn't really constitute Singaporean food) and great taste!

The line for this stall is usually very long on the weekends, but I was able to go on a weekday with no wait. Yes, the chicken rice was great, juicy, and plump. However, any other chicken rice stall around Singapore has similar chicken rice that tastes just as great. It was $3.50 SGD at Tian Tian for the white chicken rice (no soup given). However, I am able to find some places around Singapore that sells chicken rice that is just as great for $2.50 SGD and they give you soup. Give this place a try if you like, but if the line is extremely long I say you should try chicken rice at another stall.",

As a plate of drumstick plus rice was $4.30 I asked what else is included. Immediately she said no drumstick, and I said your menu said so. Immediately she printed another receipt for a plate of chicken rice at $3.50. This is the going price for a hawker stall elsewhere. I wondered how much the tourists in front of me paid for the similar looking plate of chicken rice. The cashier obviously know what she was doing. The chicken rice was in clumps, made worst by the thick sauce they pour on the chicken possibly to flavour it. Chicken was not flavourful as they need to poured the thick sauce over it. Good steamed chicken does not need any condiments. Enough said. The old Swee Kee chicken rice wins hands down compared to this.",

Loved it. Steamed chicken was okay. Then we read that this place was recommended by Antony Bordain, hence group of European looking tourists in the que. For 3 SGD it was perfect! The Maxwell Center has a lot to offer too, so we ended up trying the oyster cake and a sugar cane drink. Coming back tonight to try the ramen from one of the stalls.",

The rice was oh so fragrant and brothy. It helped that we didn't have to wait long for the food.

    "text": "LOVE IT. Worth the queue. 11/10 one of the best chicken rice vendors in Singapore, and perhaps the world.The rice is fragrant and fluffy. Not overcooked; you can taste and feel the individual grains as you shove each spoonful into your mouth - no kidding. The steamed chicken is flavourful, tender, and melts in your mouth. The chilli sauce (with ginger) complements both chicken and rice perfectly, adding a tantalising kick to every bite. And you have the option to order some steamed oyster-sauce veggies as a side, if you feel the need to be healthy amidst the amazing hawker fare in Singapore.All-round satisfying dish. Pair your chicken rice with 'sugar cane juice with lemon' (from any stall in Maxwell market) to make this the quintessential Singaporean meal.Side note: Drooling as I type this review. Need to planning my next visit to Tian Tian!",

The chicken was cold, very smooth and velvety, if that makes sense. \u00a0I actually liked the sauce, but thought that there was too much of it and would have been very content with just the ginger chili sauce which was the best I have had in Sing. \u00a0They poured a lot of the soy-based sauce on my dish and I ended up tasting that more than the chicken. \u00a0Rice was good, but not as memorable for me. Like most, I wanted to complain about the rice and the vegetables costing extra. \u00a0And I miss my clear broth soup. \u00a0It helps wash everything down. \u00a0But it was $12 SIN so yeah...It was awesome.Come here if you have the chance. \u00a0It's definitely worth the visit and judge for yourself.",

But it is well executed, a tiny plate filled with two ways to mainline chicken flavor.(1) the chicken, which somehow tastes less like chicken than (2) the rice, which tastes like ten chickens. The chicken, pillowy and soft like a baby's skin, needs the accompanying spicy sauce and is mostly enjoyable for its texture. The rice needs nothing.",

    "text": "I am not very often angry when receiving bad food. Disappointed, yes. Upset, maybe but never angry.While I know that food review sites and awards are always subjected to the reviewer's tastebuds, I never really thought that I would get so angry over a stall that doesn't deserve its award..... until today. For years I've been wanting to give Tian Tian Chicken Rice a try but could never bring myself to join the crazy queue. Than came Singapore's edition of the Michelin Guide and with a Bib Gourmand recommendation, the queues became even longer and after tasting it for the first time today....I can't help but think WHY? Tian Tian chicken rice lacks just about everything I would consider as a good chicken rice. The Rice.While the texture of the rice was fine, it was neither fragrant or tasty. It lacked the depth that a lot of better chicken rice places have. It didn't have that pungent garlic or ginger taste, or the umami-ness of the chicken stock used to cook the rice. While the colour looked on point, the flavours were severely lacking. The ChickenSeeing that it was our first time trying, we ordered a portion of white (boiled) chicken and a portion of the roasted. Portions were generous but the meat was overcooked and stringy. The white chicken didn't have the smooth, moist , juicy texture that help make chicken rice so famous. Instead, it was overcooked and stringy.The roast chicken didn't fair any better. Overcooked, stringy and the skin didn't offer any flavours to the protein. The only plus point was the sauce that was drizzled over the chicken, which was fragrant and tasty but even that could not offer any redemption to the overall disappointment to the dish. To the tourists that have tried it because of the Bib Gourmand, my sincerest apologies for not offering you the best chicken rice experience in Singapore and for those you are thinking about trying, please don't, there are better options out there. Michelin recommended? Better to rip that page out of the book.",

Ok, \u00a0so back to the chicken... disappointing. The chicken was tough, \u00a0potentially overcooked or from frozen and chopped way too thick. I'm used to silky smooth meat that's full of flavour. And where was my chicken skin? I know it's not healthy, \u00a0but surely that should be my decision to make??? This was then covered with a gravy. \u00a0Surely that's only required if you need to remoisten the meat or add flavour to the bland chicken. \u00a0Anyway, \u00a0onto the rice. \u00a0It had some chicken stock flavour, \u00a0but was way too sticky and heavy in my opinion. Could have been enhanced with more ginger/garlic. Condiments... The chilli was passable but nothing worth writing about. Apparently you have to specifically ask if you want ginger and sweet soy. I say a lot, \u00a0but the reputation certainly builds up the expectation.

Unlike other places that just serves their chicken plain, at Tian Tian they dress up their chicken with an awesome sauce that makes it taste velvety smooth. They also don't offer the typical chicken broth or ginger sauce but those aren't really necessary. The rice itself was fragrant and full of flavor, and the garlic chili sauce was just perfect with the right amount of heat. The vegetable with oyster sauce is just your typical baby bok choy blanched in water so nothing to rave about, but we always order some veggies with every meal.Definitely stop by here to try Singapore's national dish and eat like a local.",

Every guide book and every local has told me that, this is definitely the spot to try it.Now, I'm an exchange student in Thailand right now (in Bangkok to be exact). Hainanese chicken and rice is also very popular here and it's the place where I tried it for the first time. It's very delicious and very cheap in Thailand (it costs less than 2 US dollars).With that being said, I was really looking forward to trying it in Singapore, the home of this iconic dish.When I arrived, I was happy and sad to see a line. Happy because it means the food is great and sad because it means I'll have to wait.I eventually got it and I have to say, it's very good!!! But, I'll be honest, the Hainanese chicken and rice I've had in Bangkok tastes better. But the Hainanese chicken and rice in this restaurant is still great and it's definitely worth a visit when you're in Singapore",

    "text": "When we showed up to the Maxwell Centre yesterday afternoon, we saw a long line and worried that it might be for Tian Tian...and we were right. That said, the line itself, while looking a bit daunting, moves along relatively quickly - after all, how long can it take to serve a bunch of chicken rice? We ended up getting to the front of the line in about 20 minutes' time - not too bad - and we were served shortly thereafter. Unless you are really full already, I would go with a large, which, in all honesty, is not that large to begin with. Once we found ourselves a table, we chowed into the famous chicken rice - and in all honesty, it is pretty good, but it was not quite as 'amazing' as waiting in line might make you expect. The chicken is flavored well, although the sauce is a bit on the light side. I really do enjoy the cilantro here, but the quantity of leaves is pretty small. Speaking of quantity - the amount of chicken is also a bit less than I would expect, and with the pieces served with bones in them, you do have to work your way around it to get the meat off - no small feat when you have no napkins and no knives to help with. The rice is really well-flavored on its own - I could probably just eat that as a standalone - and the combination of the marinated chicken with the rice makes it easy to understand why it's so popular.So why the average rating? As I mentioned, the quantity of food was a bit low. For S$7.80, it's not a bad deal...but consider when we decided to give Tong Fong Fatt (a few stalls down a whirl)...it's no contest - their chicken is better, you get more of it (as well as soup), it is cheaper to boot, and perhaps best - there's no line. So despite the accolades that Anthony Bourdain and all the other testimonials say, the food here is certainly good - but it's not even the best version that is available amongst the rest of the hawker stalls.",

Located in the Maxwell Food Centre hawkers is where I found Tian Tian. I knew to come here because I researched beforehand best chicken rice in Singapore. Tian Tian got voted such by local foodies and celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain. If that wasn't reason enough, a helpful hint I always go by is that you always eat where the locals flock to. There's a good reason for that line you're about to stand in. Service didn't take long at all, and this line was only 3 people deep. You get served on the spot, we ordered two servings of chicken rice. That's the reason we came here. The rice was fragrant, with chicken was so tender and smooth. The skin didn't bother me, it was thin and not chewy like eating a fatty piece on meat. The broth complimented it all with chili and soy sauce; it was perfect.",

When I came there had been a long line.One thing I first noticed was there were no bones and the dish was pretty convenient to eat. The rice is cooked in chicken stock, it was infused, altogether cast over with lovely chicken flavour, so eating it alone brought a great pleasure. The meat was tender, was breaking apart by slightly being stirred about. Tender and juicy. Also, the ginger garlic and spice dipping sauce goes well with it. The dish can't be likened to the Hainanese chicken I had back in Toronto.",

The chicken is almost like a sou vide preparation where it is barely cooked with a savory sauce poured on top of it and the rice.It wasn't my favorite dish, but it was tasty. I think the popularity has more to do with it being a traditional comfort food for locals. The one thing that locals really like, but others don't' really understand why they love it so much.

They don't give black sauce unless you ask.They no longer give soup. Not sure if they will if asked.Be prepared to queue. Just look at the photo I posted. Most times the queue is a lot longer.

Not sure if that was a result of miscommunication or being ripped off since she was obviously foreign. Lol. The chicken rice is worth the hype, in my opinion, and the chili is AMAZING! Besides the chicken and fragrant rice, the chili that comes with Hainanese Chicken Rice is really able to make it or break it for me. In Tian Tian's case, it definitely made it :) I'll be back!",

It just looks like a pile of normal rice but it has such a rich flavor and pairs really well with the pretty unassuming chicken. The drink stands are separate from the rest of the food stands, so be sure to grab a beer to pair with it like a Tiger. The Bok Choy was also delicious, it was super rich (and very oily, so be aware of that). We went to the stands at around 4pm, so most of them were closed or closing, but this was still open and the line was in-and-out. Be sure to bring a pack of tissues, as the eating area wasn't particularly clean-looking by western standards -- but that totally wasn't a problem at all! Definitely come here for the chicken rice and check out the rest of the stands!",

I passed by this joint on a weekend a couple days later and saw the line running all the way out to the streets before you even get into the hawker centre! The chicken and rice dish definitely hit the spot. The skin was full of oil that was naturally coming out from the chicken and melts right in your mouth. As well, the chicken meat was super tender and juicy. It is always a pleasure eating chicken in Asia as it is much more naturally flavourful than the ones in America. The rice itself was decent but was expecting it to be more aromatic. Highly recommend folks to come here and give them a try as it is one of the top spots in Singapore.",

Here at Tian Tian, the food is hawker-style - no fancy platings or decorations on the dishes. Just plain good chicken and rice. The rice was very flavorful - good enough to be eaten alone - and the chicken was very tender. I usually don't like to eat the skin but with Tian Tian's, it didn't even matter. Price for a plate is about US$7 per person.JONASAPPROVED!",

I'm not sure what Bourdain was on when he had this. \u00a0He must have been high, drunk, or was just being polite. \u00a0I would pass on this stall and the wait.",

It says that locals are still willing to brave the long tourist-enhanced wait for this chicken rice, despite being knowledgeable of the many alternatives. And indeed, this chicken rice is worth waiting for. There's not a whole lot of superlatives to add, except that you can definitely customize your order to include only leg meat, which I liked (I ordered 4 legs for my wife and I). Don't just order 'chicken rice' if you know anything about this dish and need to amortize your wait over more mouthfuls. They are also happy to give you as much chilli sauce as you might need. The meat is silky and well-seasoned on its own, but the provided chilli and dark soy sauce makes it superb! I am continually astounded by reviewers who don't seem to understand that in hawker food, the side sauces are essential additions, and not just for show, like salt and pepper on western tables. Combine with a mouthful of savory rice for a spectacular sensation. PS- there are lots of seats on the outer wings of the hawker centre, don't just look for them inside.",

The drawback is the dish was just too oily for my taste and the chicken has a bit too much red meat (I personally prefer white meat chicken for chicken rice). The accompanying chili sauce helps give a bit of contrast to the oiliness but nonetheless not the best chicken rice in SG for me. We also tried the stall next to it (which is a spin-off from the original restaurant) - while the taste overall is similar, I do find Tian Tian's rice a little bit more fragrant. But if Tian Tian's line is super long (as it sometimes is during peak hours), you can't go wrong with the stall next door",

I think that's the perfect word to describe my experience eating the infamous Anthony Bourdain/Michelin Star rated Hainan Chicken.The chicken was cold when we started eating, and the only sauce that came with it is the red sauce, which is quite spicy so be cautious when drenching the chicken for the first time. I also feel like I didn't get a lot of meat for what we paid for. It was mainly just bone ... Another disappointment. The rice was good but I just feel like I expected so much more and that's not what I got. I've definitely tried better Hainan Chicken back home. Maybe I just had too many expectations but I don't think I'll be back, nor would I recommend this to visiting friends and family. I'm sure there's better places out there.",

First time I attempted to try out this place was on a Thursday at around 5:30 pm, about 6 or 7 people ahead of me by the time they \u00a0completely sold out - sad. Ended up going to Ah Tai (which was delish!).Tried again on a Friday around 11:45 am. The line was super long, but it moved quickly. We got a medium sized portion for $5 SGD. The rice was delish and the chicken was tender. The spicy sauce was really spicy and so good! I will say that after trying Ah Tai, I felt like Ah Tai was a better value and just as delish. If you're not feeling the wait for tian tian, def try out Ah Tai. Otherwise, tian tian is worth a try!",

Full of flavor, rich and creamy from the chicken broth. BUT! the chicken itself wasn't spectacular - sort of slimy, and not a ton of meat, mostly bones. Boo. My best rec? Get the chicken rice from TIan Tian, then meander a few stalls down to add some soy sauce chicken to your rice. Awwesome mix.",

Guess they are THAT popular and famous that they have one window to pay and another to get your food, when most hawker stallls are usually a one or two man show. The chicken rice here, along with the one in Far East Plaza, is supposedly the most popular in Singapore for chiken rice. But the blue sign hawker stall on the second floor of Golden Shoe hawker is just as good, and my coworkes and I frequent this one more often as it's right next to our work in raffles place. Can't choose! all three are good, with juicy chicken and fragrant rice. \u00a0I always get the steamed chicken rice with no skin, with extra hot sauce.",

Located at the heart of maxwell food centre, this stall boast large crowds and occupying two stalls spacing. I ordered a medium serving which when it came, looks plain boring. Aside from the looks, the medium serving gave quite a big portion of chicken! As there was much hype about this stall's chicken rice, I think I expected too much as when I took a bite, nothing was special about it. The chicken and rice was not bad but not \"best chicken rice\" worthy. The chilli was exceptional which gave life to my bland chicken rice! Expected much more from them!!!!",

    "text": "3 stars. I didn't really need to look up online to find out where to eat at the Maxwell Food center, I just needed to find the stalls that had a line and this one definitely had a line. I enjoyed the Hainan Chicken Rice here. Ended up ordering half a chicken and boy was it large in size. Usually when you order half a chicken, you'd be lucky that it would ever come in this size. This is probably a Chicken that was fed hormones/anti-biotics or something because it was huge. Usually organic/non anti-biotics chickens don't get this big so that's just my speculation. The sauce that was drenched all over the chicken might have been a bit much, would have preferred no drenching of the chicken, it didn't add much to the flavor and it just make more wet than it needs to be. The chicken was very tender and juicy both the dark meat and the white meat. Rice was very well done full of flavor. I would definitely come here again if I'm in Singapore again for my Hainan chicken rice cravings but sadly I don't think it's the best Hainan chicken rice I've ever had. I think places in Hong Kong did a better job. But regardless if I'm in the area, I'd still come back! and yes like all stalls at a Hawker center, it's cash only!",

Tian Tian dish is more subtle in taste compared to the other which tastes mostly like garlic.

And for $3.50 SGD, the chicken rice dish is probably one of the least expensive dish you can buy at this hawker center. And at that price, the serving portion (of chicken) is not particularly large... but you do get plenty of rice to fill your belly up. As for the famous chicken, the 6 or 7 slices are soft, moist and flavorful. Though I do wonder how much of that tasty flavor was from the broth they spoon on the dish before serving. I'm giving Tian Tian 4 stars... If this dish was served at another hawker stand, I would prob give it 3 stars. But eating out is never just about food alone, and factor in the whole experience of waiting in a long line along with everyone else ordering chicken rice... That deserves one more star in my opinion.",

Though it's a typical small sized stall that you'd expect at any hawker centre in Singapore, they've got enough manpower that the division of labor with such little space is impressive! Order after order is rolled out so efficiently that your mouth just waters as the queue gets shorter. If it's 2-3 of you, I highly suggest grabbing half a chicken and 3 rice bowls! Soup is included, along with all the condiments (it's not Hainan chicken without all the sauces)! The chicken is so damn succulent that you'll want to eat it until the very last bit of meat (and veins) that you're nearly close to the bone marrow!If you know some Chinese (or getting a bit rusty), this is your chance to speak it as some of the ladies passing you the food don't know too much English (maybe some Singlish though, haha).

Before her visit to Singapore, she sent me a link to your video (I'm sorry I've never cared enough to watch any of your shows even though I'm practically always on Food Network) and MADE me watch it so that I could bring her there.Well, that's the thing...that video and your stupid picture on the stall makes people think that the stall is freaking good because you \"approved\" it.Oh, please.It is quite obvious in the video that you would have never tried chicken rice if the crowd didn't BOO the living crap out of you (which I've done since I first watched one of your shows).So I must say - as I did to my fair lady - that I knew of Tian Tian way before you even highlighted it in your story. Singaporeans know their food and will never need your picture or \"approval\" to seal in the awesomeness of a particular stall.For example, I just look for a freaking line that is longer than your achievements and know that the food will be GREAT. Just like on the day that I binged on two orders of chicken rice to try both the roast and the standard steamed version...I tried the porridge with a line that took nearly 40 minutes before I got to order...that DIDN'T have your face on their stall.For the record, do us all non-fans of yours a favor before we bash you even more and tell the truth to your fans (such as my fair lady) that your \"approval\" of this stall is worthless because your opinion on Asian food (or all other local food) just doesn't count. Not to mention, if the crowd didn't boo you, I'm 100% sure you wouldn't have tried chicken rice.You fail.Tian Tian just WINS enough to grace you with their attention so you can make a buck by featuring it.Get a real chef job.Sincerely,ChickenRice-FanYelp 100: 24/100",

It takes about 40 minutes taking the MRT from Changi to get here. Just hop of at stop 15 and go down maxwell road. What you see is what you get: chicken and rice ;)This dish is so tender and flavored! You will love it!",

Love the ginger sauce as well. I add the thick soy sauce to the rice and mix it together. Yum! One of my favorite meals in Singapore.",

    "text": "Since hearing the tale of how the hawkers at this restaurant famously defeated Gordon Ramsay in a cook off battle, I've been clamouring to try this stall.Chicken rice is my favourite Singaporean dish so I badly wanted this one to blow me away. The queue was pretty intimidating around lunch time but it moved quickly enough. The ordering process itself was bit of a nightmare. The woman at the till was very brusque and seemed more intent with moving me along. Understandable but in her haste, she ended up getting my order wrong and pointing me to the wrong collection queue (and then scolding me later for not being at the right one).All the logistics aside, the chicken rice was good but not amazing. My chicken was tender but there were way too many bones. The rice was fragrant but again, not unexpected with a chicken rice dish at most other stalls. You also have to order your vegetables separately ($4 for a plate that can be shared between 2) which was slightly annoying since most places do everything together for a cheaper price. Most of the people queuing up were also tourists which can sometimes be a telling sign as to whether a restaurant is more hype than substance. In this case, I am afraid it is.",

    "text": "It was as if clouds took rice form and were cooked in an amazing broth of just right seasoning - that is what the rice is like from TianTian. Having first tried the chicken rice in Chinatown, I had an \"okay\" benchmark of what it could be compared to. This little hawker stall (or rather two hawker stalls) lived up to the hype. The rice was flavorful, fragrant and indeed was eaten by itself for a few moments before realizing there was a half chicken waiting to be consumed also. Paired with the soy and chili sauce, the chicken and the rice worked together wonderfully, and left me to wonder if this was better than 53rd and 6th's own Chicken and Rice. My conclusion: it holds its weight. A must-try if visiting Singapore. Not just because a celebrity chef said so, but because food should be considered a way to get to know a new culture intimately. And with this simple dish, you definitely feel at home, even thousands of miles away.",

When we said two she said half chicken is more than enough. The rice is super flavorful! We ordered to go and the one complaint I had is they did not pack any ginger sauce. When I think of Hainan Chicken rice I think ginger sauce and yummy rice. For me the star of the dish is the rice. Need to add the ginger sauce. The chicken was juicy and tender. We ordered bean sprouts ans that was delicious!! It tasted very much like home cooked meal. Amazing!!! Cannot wait to go back. This time I will make sure I get the ginger sauce.",

    "text": "As many others that travel to Singapore, Tian Tian is probably on the top of their list of must try restaurants/food stalls. \u00a0A local friend recommended Tian Tian (or Ah Tai if the line was too long here) so naturally I knew I would be stopping by. \u00a0We had originally planned on stopping by for either lunch or dinner on Monday but after checking their business hours, we noticed they were closed that day. \u00a0Seeing how we were leaving on Wednesday morning, we made the trek over to Tian Tian (don't utilize the map location on yelp as it takes you to the wrong place as this is hawker stand is inside the Maxwell food center) for an early dinner. \u00a0It was a super muggy/hot evening so we opted to take the food back to the hotel to enjoy in an air conditioned room. \u00a0We were lucky to find a short line and were in and out within 5 minutes. \u00a0We ended up ordering their half chicken along with two orders of rice and an order of their bean sprouts. \u00a0To our surprise, the portions were huge!!! \u00a0We only ended up eating 3/4 of the chicken and maybe about 3/4 of the rice. \u00a0One draw back about taking the food to go is that they didn't include the ginger oil and also some sweet soy sauce which is what we are accustomed to having along with our Hainan chicken rice. \u00a0Though the chicken was super tender, I didn't think the rice was that aromatic or flavorful. \u00a0Despite being disappointed with the rice, Tian Tian was 1/4 the cost of our dinner at Chatterbox. \u00a0I think the perfect Hainan chicken dinner would be the chicken at Tian Tian and the rice from Chatterbox.Tian Tian is still a must try when visiting Singapore, but I think I'll try other places before coming back again.",

Was shocked to see a long line to the counter and from what I heard from my cousin, that was quite typical of Singapore, especially the good ones.We waited in line and really hoped that the chicken rice would be worth the long wait. I saw a number of people walking with their chicken rice plates and quite honestly they didn't look appetizing at all.Finally got the counter and ordered their much famed chicken rice. They drop a bowl of rice on the plate, some sauce in it and chicken breast slices on the top, and a few slices on cucumber on the side.Would never imagine that something that looks so simple cab taste so good. Wow wow wow, I can't stop raving about this dish. It is so flavorful. Worth it, the long wait was totally worth it!!!",

    "text": "I was told Tian Tian has the best hainan chicken in Singapore. That's why even though it was closed the first day I went (on a Thursday evening!?) I decided to go again the next day.Well, first things first, the price was unbeatable. Only $4 for a chicken rice plate?! Although the portion wasn't that big, it was pretty filling and I felt kind of full with just one plate. It was probably the rice - which had a fantastic smell of chicken oil+coconut. The chicken however was just okay. It wasn't very tender and a bit on the dry side. But again the experience of eating the rice itself was so enjoyable that it added points to the chicken as well.I give 4 stars mostly because of the price and the rice. Quality of the chicken and the long line doesn't really justify it to be a 5-star restaurant. If I could go to Singapore again, this wouldn't be on my list of \"must-go\" restaurants but I wouldn't mind dropping by and grabbing a plate.",

But how's the food? \u00a0The Hainanese chicken is just ok. But nearly all of this type of chicken is just ok because it's all about the rice and sauce. The meat is smooth, evenly cooked, relatively clean (devoid of fatty sinews and bone spurs) for this type of chicken. The rice is very good, but not bursting with flavor as the pro chef's review suggests. Still, its soft, juicy, and fragrant. This stall's orange colored sauce is legitimately hot. Not as hot as something like, say, a Halal Guys red sauce in Manhattan, but still quite heated. \u00a0FYI: The Singaporeans do not seem to rock the ginger, green onion sauces that them Cantonese folks like. Overall it's about average and it makes wonder if I should be letting a \"gwai lo\" (in Cantonese) tell me what is good Chinese food.",

This one barely qualifies as decent as it does lack some of the freshness and also appear to use some chicken that is not the highest quality.

I wanted to try all the Hainan Chicken Rice out there. Before coming to Tian Tian, I had about 7-8 different Hainan Chicken Rice from places all over Singapore. Honestly, they were good, but NOT amazing. I got to the stall at around 11am. There were only a few people in front of me. For two people, we shared half a chicken and rice. THE CHICKEN WAS SO TENDER AND FLAVORFUL. AND THE RICE OMG. You can literally just eat the rice by itself. It was so fragrant. All the other chicken rice we ate, we ad leftover rice, but this place, we cleaned the plate in less than 5 minutes. ALSO, the SPICY SAUCE, is sooooo amazing. I love spicy food and it had the perfect kick. It was so good that we took two more orders to go with us to Sentosa to eat on the beach. Don't judge me! My only complaint is that the chicken had a lot of bones. Other places made it with chicken breast and no bones so it was a lot easier to eat and less fatty. If I ever come back to Singapore, it would be for Tian Tian, nothing else. I MISS IT ALREADY.",
