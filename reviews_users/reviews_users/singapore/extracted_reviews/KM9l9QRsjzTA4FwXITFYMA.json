    "text": "The good: High quality ingredients. Good ikan billis, nicely cooked onsen egg, tasty fish cake and quality noodles. You can tell a lot of care has gone into the food, and It's a nice place with a comfortable ambience. The combo meals are also pretty good value. The Less Good:All the above can't make up for lack of flavour. Unfortunately the broth of the House Special Pan Mee lacked flavour, and so did the noodles themselves. The same for the hot Chilli pan Mee. Very little flavour, and could've done with a light toss in some pork oil, or the drippings from the mince pork topping. The Chilli comes in a tiny container, which I thought was a bit stingy but turned out to be plenty. It was very spicy indeed!Overall a bit disappointing but I'd come back for the Sarawak Laksa (which I saw too late, after I'd placed my order!) and Kolo Mee.",

    "text": "This is the closest thing I have to the kin kin chilli pan Mee frm KL! Even the original Kin kin which now resides in Singapore is no where close to the KL kin kin! At about $9.20 for a set meal which comes with a small side and drink of your choice. The noodles is soft and not too dry, the egg is done perfectly to be mixed coating every bit of noodle. The bowl that they use is huge and it doesn't look like much but I have to say I'm very full after having finished it. A bit expensive for a bowl of noodles when I compare it to KL, but who am I kidding?! You can hardly get anything cheap in Singapore these days. But the question is, \"does it hit the spot when I can't have the kin kin dried chilli pan Mee in Singapore?\" YES DEFINITELY!!They should offer some soup to accompany it though. 4.0 STARS",

Although it is not the best I tasted but I'm pretty sure the next time you have ban mian craving, kin kin and face to face will not pop up in your mind ever.The positive thing is that the Sarawak noodle taste pretty ok, much better than the ban mian here.",

The pork was quite good, and the noodles were quite al dente, and tossed with the egg, made it moderately tasty. I just don't understand why they give such a miserly portion of their chilli, which is in a tiny plastic container. They should put the chilli in self-serve containers on their tables.",

    "text": "Came here approximately at 5+pm on a Tuesday evening.It was pretty empty at that time. Only two tables were occupied (one occupied by the owner herself). And another corner seat was filled with another person with a laptop. Managed to get a corner seat too so I was able to re-pack the things I bought earlier.Had always wanted to try their hot and spicy pan mee and their wantons. Ordered that with three musketeers (lime, lemon, kumquat?) - pretty refreshing mix of sour and salty beverage.I left the noodles in the open for awhile before eating it as I was busy doing other stuffs. Managed to take a nice shot of it. Tried the wanton but it wasn't flavorful. The skin was crispy but the two small bite wantons probably lack of pepper and salt. The noodle was stuck together (like a lump) when I was about to consume it. On the side, there is a plastic container of the \"spicy mix\" to add flavors to the existing ingredients - flat noodles, poached egg, minced meat, fried anchovies and shreds of spring onions (not sure). But somehow the flavors were there. The meat was soft. The noodles were chewy and the anchovies gave a crunch and salty after taste to add to the noodles.The environment is definitely conducive for studying or doing admin work if you are on the go. I stayed here for awhile and decided to try the longan Ribena drink. Wasn't too impressive on that. Will be back again to try their other noodle and appetizer options ;)",

    "text": "Nice theming \u00a0for a noodle shop. Walls \u00a0decorated with wood carving and umbrella. The environment completes with thick wooden table and chairs, a cool air con and piped in music. This gives a nice rustic feeling bringing you back to yesteryear. Well may be not the music.It's a quick service concept but delivers the food to you. With limited number of choices, ordering was quickly taken. The cashier seems knowledgeable but did a small mistake but was corrected quickly. Overall the staff was friendly. Noodle dishes description was put up on a large menu board behind the counter much like that of a fast food restaurant. May be it is mimicking that as the food arrived quickly.Ordered the house special pan noodle value meal. The deal came with noodle, 2 wings and a drink. The noodle came with some minced meat , greens and an egg. The ikan billis (anchovies) came at the side along with a sambal chilli paste in a tub. The side dish of chicken wings came in the same long dish. Not sure if it was supposed to dump the anchovies and sambal into the soup, but I didn't. The egg looked good and I eat it alone, but it was rather cold. The soup was bland, it may be because I did not mix in the condiments. The noodle was cooked well and soft but not soggy mostly because the whole bowl was lukewarm.The 2 wings were pre-prepared so the skin was not as crispy as it would be. It was like only 1 and half wing as one of the wing was less than half the size of the other wing. Other side dishes available was fried won ton and cheese ball. The drink was honey lemon that tasted a tad salty hopefully from the 2 slices of lemon and not from some where else. At least the drink was cold with ice.Overall value wise, you pay for the environment. The noodle, side and drink itself should not command such a price as you can get better noodle and fried wings elsewhere. But then it is a restaurant in a shopping center that is \u00a0considered downtown, so price is somewhat cheaper than say at an orchard road eateries.",

    "text": "I'm a huge huge fan of KL kin kin chili pan mee (used to love the one at mcpherson but it sucks now), and so when I saw that there was another one in another area I decided to check it out. But I was very disappointed! I was craving it so badly and had such high expectation! I guess trying this place for the first time would be a 50/50 shot anyway considering the reviews. But I was close by and I figured well it can't be that bad. Yeah it was that bad. SO, STAY AWAY!!!!!! Absolutely terrible and super bland. I thought I needed more chili to enhance the flavorless pan mee but adding chili did not help at all. My bf and I had ordered the Sarawak noodle and Chili pan mee. The chili had no kick and flavorless, it's just like a plain boring dried chili; so different from how it's supposed to taste like originally in KL. The price is actually very high for a (not so delish) bowl of noodle so it's quite ridiculous however it's acceptable if the taste is mind-blowing. I heard the chef is from Ipoh well I guess he needs to visit KL and recreate his recipe again otherwise he won't have any repeat customer which is sad as I see a potential in him. Sadly I won't be back as of now. Hope it gets better in time.",

The onsen egg is done just right. However, the flavor itself was lacking, and no amount of side dressings can make up for that. Also, this place does not take credit cards. For a nice eatery charging more than $10 in a shopping mall, that just shows a lack of concern for customer convenience.",
