Polished it off right quick, then went back and nailed the lamb one too!Really tasty; Fast friendly service; Slightly pricey at $10-a-go, but at that time of the night do you really care?",

    "text": "The restaurant is located along Beach Road, across the road from PARKROYAL on Beach Road. The restaurant is open concept, with a few high tables available for al fresco dining. Although it is lunch time the place is not crowded. As I remember the Entertainer mobile has 1-for-1 chicken/lamb/beef shawarma promotion, I decide to use the promotion. The staff allows the promotion but does not allow me to mix the choices. Beef shawarma ($9) is not available. Between chicken shawarma ($8) and lamb shawarma ($9), I decide on lamb shawarma. I could select the vegetables and 2 kinds of sauces for the wraps. For vegetables, I select all which includes shredded lettuce, tomatoes, beans and sliced olives. Out of the 6 kind of sauces, I select garlic and hummus which is highly recommended by the staff. \u00a0After wrapping up, the staff lightly toasted the wraps. Although plain looking, the wrap is quite filling with crunchy vegetables and spicy sauce. Quite yummy to have.",

One thing I can tell you, when I ordered a 3 dishes they came different from the picture on the menu. \u00a0the pic they have in the menu is just a pic and the food completely different.

    "text": "Visiting Singapore and staying on Beach Road this was our very first stop. The appeal was Kebab because we were looking forward to good Turkish kebabs. The last time we had good Turkish food was in Australia. (There is awesome Turkish food in Sydney!) Anyway. The service was good. Both the cashier and the kebab maker were courteous and polite. The food however was underwhelming. Choices are chicken, lamb, mixed, or falafel. Fillings are cabbage, pickle, tomato, onion, cheese. Sauces (all from a squeeze bottle) are chili, garlic, mayo, hummus (did you read squeeze bottle?) , spicy chili, garlic mayo (not a typo), ketchup (what?) Choose meat, fillings, and two sauces. All is put into a pita bread, \u00a0wrapped, and pressed into a kebab. It was not a bad meal. It was not the kebab I was expecting. I suggest if you want more of a Lebanese type experience you head a few short steps into Arab or Bussorah street and try one of those restaurants. I mean there is not even tabbouleh or real hummus here.",

Wow was I surprised with such nice fresh ingredients and service with a smile. Prices can't be beat: e.g., falafel wrap was 6.50 Sing (or about $5 USD) and was quite massive in weight. \u00a0They also offer things for the carnivores as well. \u00a0Order your food and enjoy it while watching life go by on the avenue perched at one of their shaded tables out front. \u00a0They also take cc's.
