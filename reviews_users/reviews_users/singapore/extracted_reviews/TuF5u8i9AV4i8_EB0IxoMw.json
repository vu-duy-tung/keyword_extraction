    "text": "Not many may know that Tampopo has launched their FIRST Kyoto fair featuring the award-winning KYOTO BEEF only until 11th FEBRUARY!! \u00a0Kyoto Beef? How good can it be when it's not even one of the Top 3 Wagyu Beef in Japan? Yes, I had those questions in mind too but when I had a bite of the Kyoto Beef, I nearly wanted to flip the tables. (Just kidding) Trust me, this breed of cow is just as elite as the vegetables and tofu produce from Kyoto.Wagyu purists might disagree but I do not care. This is definitely my ideal cattle because of the regular marbling of fats make this a balanced cut that is tender yet not too fatty. Kobe beef felt like swallowing a whole chunk of butter and I couldn't proceed after one. But not for this. The one-week Kyoto fair is run by Okamoto san, an experienced chef with a restaurant in Kyoto. ALL ingredients, from the pickles in the appetizers to the strawberries in dessert are all imported from Kyoto. There is ala carte menu but the lunch/dinner course is much more highly recommended for the full quality experience. The price ranges from $28 to $100, which is jaw-droppingly reasonable for the excellent standards of the meal. But that's not the end. The dessert brought the Kyoto meal to another climax. Matcha Fondue. Yes, dark green liquid served WARM with Kyoto Strawberries, Warabi Mochi, Matcha Cake and Shiratama Dango. This was so ridiculously good that I licked my fondue cup clean. Blissful. The beef, the tofu, the matcha. Every ingredient played their respective role in he course. Looks like this meal has set a high standard for 2015 and honestly speaking, it's difficult to find another place in Singapore that can beat this in terms of value and quality.",

There were salmon nigiri, salmon maki, salmon belly sashimi. And I had the 11 kinds of sashimi don. The toppings change according to season. It was absolutely fresh and every piece was sweet and oh-so-yummy. Really good. Even if it's a bit pricy $35.80.",

From my very basic knowledge of Tampopo, they are supposed to be famous for their black pork fried cutlet and that has always been a staple in my usual order.This time round, my friend Cheryl L made me try the Wafu Steak and Fried Pork Rib Ramen, which she swears are awesome.Unfortunately, the Wafu Steak wasnt that great. It was slightly tough and a little too salty for my liking. Cheryl L agreed and was pretty upset cos it's usually very tender and the meat actually melts in your mouth. So much for our first dish.When the Ramen came, I was a little apprehensive. But the broth did not disappoint! Though it's stated that it's spicy (1 chilli), it's not spicy at all. For someone who cant take food that's too spicy, this was perfect for me (but for lovers of chilli, you might need to get them to increase the dosage!). The Fried Pork Ribs were great too. However, I'm not used to very salty food, I couldnt continue after about 4 pieces. Cheryl L happily consumed the rest. Heh.",

But, we ordered the chicken katsu, ebi bento box and a salad, and everything was delivered fast, was fresh and tasted great. Their are probably better places in Singapore, but all in all this is a great place to go to. They do get busy, so expect to wait for 20 minutes or so, and when coming with a bigger group, definitely make a reservation beforehand. The menu is big, the prices alright for Singapore, the service friendly.",

About 5 minutes while we were still eating later we were handed the cheque and staff hovered about waiting for us to pay. Even though the restaurant didn't close until 10 pm tables were being cleared and chairs put up around us, giving us the impression we were expected to get out. For a restaurant of Japanese heritage this is just shocking. Even management didn't seem interested in customer care. We certainly were not able to enjoy the food because of this atmosphere.",

Was really impressed with the presentation, and the service was impeccable, even though the staff couldn't really enunciate or speak understandable English, they were super attentive and the green tea we had was always hot and filled to the brim.

I told them it's a must to order the unagi sushi. It tasted even better than the takeaway version. Warm unagi at the top of the sushi. Next, i tried chicken teriyaki raman. Love how the chicken is grilled perfectly. One negative part will be the sauce is abit too sweet to my liking. It's a must to add in tasty egg to your bowl of ramen.  .",

The unagi served is thick and juciy which one will not expect. However the pricing for sushi is on the high side, which explains the freshness of the sushi.One dish for take away is the tam po po cream puff. In fact they do have a separate bakery store at the basement of liang court. However you can ask the staff at the restaurant on the availability of the cream puff. It is just plain awesome. Try it!",

It's value for money (not overpriced) and definitely worth repeat visits to try more of their extensive menu! Since they're famous for the ramen, we tried the Deluxe black pig shabu ramen. The broth was really flavorful - I was told they actually make their own bone soup as the broth base, not some chemical concoction. There are lotsa add-ons too like the flavored egg and spicy mentaiko. Their tonkatsu was really good... we ordered the premium loin black pig tonkatsu. I don't think I've had better tonkatsu - the meat was super juicy and tender yet the batter was extremely crunchy. Waaay better than what I've had at Tonkichi. I really liked their desserts too. We ordered the milk pudding, matcha warabi mocha and matcha parfait. I think they're all winners, though my fave was the milk pudding - silky soft and full of milky goodness!",

I must say I am pleasantly surprised as Tampopo offers not only ramen but a wide variety of Japanese dishes that range from sushi to bento sets. My first experience was to try their signature black pig shabu ramen and I must say I was very satisfied with what I had. It was authentic and very similar to the ramen I had when I was in Japan and the paper thin black pig pork belly slices simply melts in my mouth. I gave the sushis and bentos a go when I returned for my subsequent visits and realized that for the price you're paying, which isn't a lot, you get to enjoy decently authentic Japanese food, and that's why I will keep going back for more.",

Although during lunch and dinner times, the restaurant is rather packed and noisy, I must say this place serves up a bowl of delicious ramen. They're most known for their pork bone soup ramen, and my family and I have been there enough times to say for sure that you do not need to be seen at a stuffy and uptight Japanese restaurant to eat good ramen. If it's anything that describes the ramen at this place, is that it is both cheap and flavourful. You can really taste the richness of flavour in soup stock ; one spoon full of the ramen soup really packs a punch. All this at an affordable price of $14-16 a bowl. Not to mention the lovely Japanese sponge cheesecake that I love to end my heavy lunch with. It's the perfect balance of sweet and light. This place has never failed me whenever I needed a quick ramen fix and I always crave it whenever I go back to the UK to continue my studies.",
