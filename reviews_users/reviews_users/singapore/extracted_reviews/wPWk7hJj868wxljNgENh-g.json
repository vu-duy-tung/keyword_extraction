    "text": "You could say that Eurasian cuisine is the original Asian-fusion - East meets West with a whole lot of spice. Think dishes like oxtail curry, black ink calamari, chilli prawns, and roast beef. All lovely dishes with plenty of sauce and rich flavor to accompany the rice. Some of the curry dishes are surprisingly spicy - a slow build but packs a lot of heat later. Balance out the spice with some veggies like tumeric cabbage or chap chye. All in, worth the chili sweats. \u00a0 Low key during weekday lunch and kid-friendly. Quentin's is a good place to spice up your usual lunch routine.",

    "text": "My first time trying Eurasian cuisine and I loved it! The restaurant is in a tranquil part of the east side, and ample public parking just beside the restaurant. We ordered a lot of dishes and they all tasted great, by and large. Here's a low down :AppetizersKeropok with Sambal balacan- fresh, crunchy as you would expectDevil's wings - 3 full wings per serving. Well seasoned and well fried without much residual oil. Wings were a little on the scrawny side but apart from that, no complains. Meat cutlet - 2 huge fried \"begedels\" lookalike. Filled with minced meat and potato. Well fried and yet not dry. Shepard's pie - comfort food with a homemade taste. Mom in law tasted some lamb inside so watch out if you can't stand lamb. MainsPot roast beef - sliced roast beef that was a bit tough. I didn't enjoy this. Cooked with lots of caramlized onions that were delicious. Fried beef steak - with a delicious black pepper sauce, potatoes and tomatoes. I loved this dish. Beware, it's a vehicle for rice loading!Baked fish fillet - a piece of white fish that was fried first before a layer of spicy rempah smothered it all over and baked on banana leaf. Taste wise, this dish really hit the spot. A bit sweet, a bit spicy and sourish. But the fish filet was a little mushy and soft. Either not fresh, or the type of fish didn't really stand up to the robustness of such a sauce. Pineapple prawn curry - About 6 large prawns with a sweet and sourish pineapple curry gravy that was deliciously addictive to slurp on its own. Prawns were meaty and fresh but didn't really absorb the flavor of the gravy. Shame. Fried eggplant - eggplant was soft and absorbs the taste of the spicy gravy. Chap Chye - another hit with me. It's comfort food. Lots of miso (bean paste) and a mix of vegetables. I like that the cabbage isn't stewed until it's super soft. That's a personal preference :)DessertsSago Melaka - not rich enough and the gula melaka is not powerful Sugee cake - averageLive music starts about 8:30pm and there's a playroom for kids. Perfect for families !",

    "text": "Among the best meals of my life, and if it wasn't for the dry pork belly, would have been a full on 5-stars! I went here with a local colleague and basically left menu choices in his hands, and thus ended up with fabulous food (in the majority) that was just gorgeously cooked and soul-satisfying. Between the 3 of us, we ordered Water Spinach dish (Vegetarian), Eggplant dish (vegetarian), Squid Ink sauce with Calamari, Pork Belly (along with rice as an accompaniment) and then to end the meal, we got Sugee Cake as the dessert option. The majority of the food just tasted really awesome and extraordinary, and the only major disappointment was the Pork Belly - this was just so super dry, and a real struggle to chew. In contrast, the eggplant dish was melt in the mouth delicious and i enjoyed the heartiness of the water spinach dish too. My fave dish however was the Squid Ink sauce with Calamari - the squid ink was so fresh, tasted exquisite and the calamari was super tender, plus juicy and savory, with a wonderful, clean seafood taste.The Sugee Cake was a grand way to finish off the meal - I have never eaten sugee aka semolina or cream of wheat in a cake before, but I am a fan now, and am definitely looking at recipes online to tiger out how i can recreate this dessert in my own kitchen.I would def recommend this restaurant and would go try other dishes when/ if in Singapore again.",

    "text": "I can't believe it's taken me this long to try Eurasian food. Quentin's is the best (and one of the handful of places in Singapore) to give it a try!According to my sources, Eurasian cuisine is a fusion of Portuguese dishes with Malaysian and Indian spices. If you're into spicy food, you'll have a lot to choose from.I can take a little spice, but my husband can't take too much, so we had to ask our server for recommendations. As the portions are meant to be shared, we tried one seafood and one meat dish.The Cambrang Bostador are prawns cooked in a coconut curry- flavourful without being spicy! Unfortunately I am blanking out on the meat dish that we had; looking at the picture and the menu, I'm going to guess it was the Kristang style beef stew. (Or was it the oxtail?) Either way, it tasted very familiar... but different. In a good way!If I had to choose between the two, it'd be a difficult decision, as they are different flavour profiles and both so delicious! But I think I'd go with the prawns. The free flow white rice is a nice touch. My only feedback is that they might be slightly understaffed. Other than that, the food is amazing and they are close to where I live. They're getting all 5 stars from me!",

Food is great generally really tasty coconut curry prawns, chao chye (love that radish was included in the mix) The other food inthe Christmas set was too sweet for my liking - the beef, devil's curry, eggplant Not too bad though First time trying Eurasian food; tastes similar to peranakan but I think I prefer peranakan",

    "text": "To tell you honestly I didn't know what a Eurasian was until I visited Quentin and the Eurasian community house. For those who don't know, Eurasian refers to people mixed Asian and European ancestry, which I would discover are quite prevalent in South East Asia. \u00a0I had very low expectations of Quentin's coming in. There wasn't much fan fare on Yelp and no one in my neighborhood was raving about them. Boy was I dead wrong! Quentin's patrons are more often than not regulars. Seriously, who would pass up a cuisine where east meets west is a real treat. My wife and I had the Cambrang Bostador, which according to the restaurant website is \"a thick coconut based prawn-dish in a luscious union with sliced green chilies and a blend of fresh local herb.\" \u00a0Simply, wow! \u00a0Mixed with the free flow of rice, I was in heaven. The other dish we tried was the Kristang beef stew. The dish was good, but not memorable. Overall, Quentin's has a amazing selection of dishes, especially if you love SPICY food. My wife and I tried to stay away from the Spicy dishes during our first visit for the simple fact we didn't know what to expect. However, given how good the Cambrang Bostador was, I'm definitely going to be a little more adventurous the next time around!",

I've been here a few times and some of my favourite dishes include the sambal kang kong, curry devil, roast beef and black ink calamari. I doubt youd be able to find, as eurasian a meal as you can at Quentins, elsewhere. If you're feeling adventurous or traditional (for eurasians) waste no time and go there now!",

    "text": "This establishment been around a while and i have been wanting to try it but didn't go about it until recently. I happened to see a Deal.com.sg voucher for their ala carte buffet and bought a couple of vouchers and got some friends to dine there. Food was \u00a0good ... One of our favorite for the evening would be the Oxtail Devil Curry. However, the service was rather disappointing.There were a couple of wait staff that evening and there was one in particular who had really bad attitude. Firstly, when we wanted to order another round of dishes, since we been told that it takes 15-20 minutes of wait time, she rejected our orders and insisted that we need to finish our first round of orders first. So, we left it as that and placed our order with another wait staff. Towards the end of dinner, we ordered our desserts to end the evening. The same wait staff came over with our desserts and asked if we are done with our food. We said yes and she commented, I am going to charge you $5 for wasting food. \u00a0We were pretty much done with all our dishes except probably the bones, garnishes and sauce. The item she referred to was leftover of \u00a0the soup that we ordered Salted vegetable and Pork Ribs soup. \u00a0We left the boney pork ribs in the soup as it was mainly fats and bones. But she insisted that we are wasting food. I would love to see how she eats up the bones!!! \u00a0So, what we ended up doing in her lurking eyes is each of us took one piece, put on our plates... in a failed attempt to find much meats on the bone. After that episode, there was another episode, a friend order 1 beer $6. Since the meals were paid for, we just need to pay for that 1 bottle of beer. \u00a0We gave $50 to a wait staff and he asked if we got smaller change. \u00a0We gave him $7 and he never came back with $1 change! \u00a0He proceed on doing his own stuff and totally ignore us until we left. He bid us farewell from far with a \u00a0bid grin on his face. Seriously, no matter how good the food is, the service will be a big factor to deter us from going back there again.",

As I understand it, Eurasian cuisine is pretty meat (especially pork) heavy, but we were equally satisfied with the seafood and veggie options on the menu.Many diners seem to prefer the indoor section with its a/c, but at night I would recommend the terrace, which has well-spaced tables, faces out onto a big green space, and is romantically lit with hanging lamps. Families with energetic small children and canoodling couples on wine-fueled dates seem equally welcome and comfortable here, which is no small feat for a restaurant to pull off. They seem to be running a weekday discount offer, which I haven't used, but might be worth checking out for bargain hunters, as it isn't the cheapest in the area.Also, parking is usually a big issue in Joo Chiat, but here (I think) they have free on-site parking for guests beneath the building.",
