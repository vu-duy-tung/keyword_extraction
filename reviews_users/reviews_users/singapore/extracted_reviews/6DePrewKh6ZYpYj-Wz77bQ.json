Had a cheese and ham platter - it might have been enough with that, but we also had a great rib eye and risotto. \u00a0No room for desert though. The restaurant is in a very romantic neighborhood - a stroll along the canal is perfect before and after.",

Maximo brings the Real Italian element. I will definitely make this place a staple on my list for Italian food in Singapore. Prices also commensurate with quality and service.",

The first time we came after lunch they were one hr from closing and they were NOT happy to serve us but we decided to stay anyways, I am not a terrible person so we ordered quickly and ate super fast but they kept giving us mean looks and they practically took the plate away while I had food on my fork! I felt super rushed and we left within 45 mins. Today I went for dinner, was not greeted well and they CLEARLY stated they have pasta and pizza specials which is buy one and get one. I asked the waitress and she confirmed it and showed me on the menu, another waiter a male came and I confirmed again and we ordered pastas and drinks. They ignored us the rest of the time and when the bill came it was for the full amount with no special, I tried to call the waiter and he ignored me 3 times, finally he came and I showed him the bill he took it from my hand, did not let me finish my sentence and went to correct it which tells me he knew it was wrong the entire time. He was rude and I will certainly not go back.",

    "text": "Ughhh I am so conflicted writing this review. To be honest, everything BUT the food was good when we ate there this past weekend. We really liked the ambience, the service, and the crowd dining there, but the food was unfortunately underwhelming. The prices for wine by the glass are very reasonable. My prosecco cost less than $10 and you know how many places you have pay more than $12 for beer? I had the fettuccine with bacon and sundried tomato, my fianc\u00e9 had this fusilli with pesto sauce and salmon. My sauce was way too salty and it was overall a very confusing flavor. My fianc\u00e9's dish came with maybe five measly small bites of salmon. The taste wasn't that much better than the presentation. If you just want to get couple glasses of wine and grab some light fare, maybe give it a shot. But don't expect too much of the food.",

    "text": "Hate to do this but our meal at Mondo Mia was rather perfunctory. It's a rather drab looking joint but I'm willing to over look that since the likes of Da Luca have seen better days too. It strikes me as a neighborhood joint where you can pick up a pizza/pasta to go or dine in with a book if you felt like it. We sat facing the kitchen and there were no Italians in sight, which may or may not have been a warning bell because we've eaten at Indian-run Italian joints and they turn out decent pizzas. If you're a stickler for Italian-ness, there was some smarmy Italian music playing so there you go. We popped in here for a pre-theatre meal on Saturday.After we were shown to our table, we sat down and the waiter laid our table and placed a bottle of olive oil in the center. We expected some bread to appear since other tables had some but I guess our table fell though the cracks. We started our meal with one of the day's specials - burratina \u00a0with parma ham, salami and rocket leaves. This was the highlight of our meal as \u00a0the cheese was fresh (though a little sloppy even for a home made one) and went very well with the salty cold cuts and bitter leaves. My only gripe is that it cost more than our mains, but not a big deal. For mains, I had a crabmeat spaghetti with vodka sauce while the dude had an aglio olio. Both dishes were terribly bland, which is not something you'd expect with a vodka sauce or pasta tossed in spices. The aglio olio looked strikingly similar to a vongole as it had *some* garlic, no peperoncino or parsley, let alone some pecorino to top it off. You can imagine how much fun that was to consume.We paid about $70 for these 3 dishes and no wine, so I would definitely say that I've had better.",

The attention from the staff was on point, the food was excellent well executed Italian, and the music actually fit to the cuisine of the restaurant. They were extremely friendly and made recommendations and the owner/manager specifically showed such love and care for his place. Will definitely recommend this place to others and will return when I make another visit! My tummy is so happy!!",

    "text": "Serving up not only authentic italian dishes, the dining experience is made to be as close to the real deal; served complimentary prosecco and little bites with an Italian service crew recommending dishes to you, I thoroughly enjoyed the meal there, besides the fact that I was stuffed by the end of the it. I taste the mondo mio signature pasta,and though I felt it was too pricey, when I did dig into it, the price seems rather fair.Here what is great is how there are no hard and fast rules. We had also asked for a second pasta, however one that was off the menu as recommended by our server. We were more than happy to taste something according to what we had liked since the server asked us what we were the flavours we usually prefer. The pizzas were thinly crusted, well made, but given a few other italian restaurants that I've tried, the pizza didn't stand out that much.If you are undecided and strolling along Robertson Quay, this is one restaurant you can count on for decent food!",
