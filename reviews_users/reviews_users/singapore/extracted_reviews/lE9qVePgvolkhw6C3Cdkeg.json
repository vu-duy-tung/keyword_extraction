    "text": "Without a doubt, PS Cafe at Palais Renaissance is my favorite of the other locations. It's easy to get to in Orchard yet it is buried deep enough in a quiet shopping mall. I've been here a couple of times during dinner when it gets really crowded but other times I've never had to wait to be seated in the afternoons.The owners of PS Cafe branched out from fashion and that elegance has translated into the interior decor of the restaurant. Dark wood interiors that incorporate big floral arrangements added to a semi-open kitchen and a row of delightfully tempting cakes housed in glass covers, you get the idea.I'm usually very predictable with my orders at PS Cafe and that is because I love the Portobello Mushroom Soup, Caesar Salad and Truffle Shoestring Fries. I'm gladly boring for such good food.",

Basically, you're paying an exorbitant price for a serene, pretty setting. The waitstaff is mediocre; they need to be better-trained. Communications seems to be an issue here. Overall, a great option to hang out with your GFs for a few hours for brunch, coffee or afternoon break.",

There is not much else a girl could ask for.PS big bacon with eggs, eggs benedict and PS breakfast stack are my usual orders. And they never fail to satisfy my brunch cravings. Then of course, their famous truffle shoestring fries. YUMS. It will be polished up within minutes. So be prepared to order more than 1 plate if you are with other truffle fries monsters!The possible downside is that you would probably have to wait for a table especially in the weekends. But hey, queuing is our national sport. So it is fine to embrace it once in awhile=)",

Expect the similar food to the other PS outlets, although the menu tends to vary a bit in the different locations. Prices are a bit steep here, and again try the cakes which a great. My favorite is the chocolate blackout cake. Its amazing but definitely one to share as its huge! Also try the key lime pie and flourless orange cake.",

I have tried a couple of their main meals there and would not deem this as a place of fantastic food. They do hearty portions but the taste and quality can be better. The one thing that I am a great fan of is their seared tuna salad. I love how japanese flavours are incorporated into this salad with the wasabi vinaigrette. The fish was fresh and well seared and the whole combination of ingredients made it tasty, fresh and light. I tried their chocolate cake once but felt that it was pretty run-of-the-mill and not worth its expensive price tag.I would not actually visit PS Cafe for their food, but I would come back for a nice chilled afternoon for a cup of coffee to enjoy the wonderful ambience.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places in Singapore. They have several locations. I've been to this one and the one on Dempsey Road. Both are equally good. It is very consistent and they make a mean burger for those who enjoy burgers.This spot is very low key and on the smaller side, but you have the option of sitting indoor or out. We picked indoor because my BF doesn't do well in the heat. We were seated immediately even though we had not reservation. It was around 1h30 in the afternoon.We had Bloody Mary's to start and even though they were not as flavorful as we are used to, they were still very good. They used fresh tomato juice which gave a completely different flavor profile. It comes with a celery, cucumber and carrot stick and a green olive.My BF had the PS. BURGER (wagyu & us chuck patty, vintage cheddar,wilted spinach, crispy smoked bacon, tomato & crispy onions, toasted sesame bun & chunky fries). He asked for no mayo or BBQ sauce and switched from the Chunky Fries to the Truffle Fries and holy cow were they good! You get a good amount of them too. It's kind of a signature dish for them.I had the Caesar Salad with Poached Egg, Smoked Bacon, Baby Cos, Baked Croutons, Parmesan. I asked for dressing on the side and regretted it. It was fresh and light, but I think it would have been better with the dressing incorporated. The egg was somewhere between soft and hard, but very good.For dessert, his eyes had caught on a Marshmallow Brownie Pie which not only ginormous, but delicious! It was so big and so rich he couldn't finish it!Overall a great experience!",

I like the two of them must have eaten a lot, lol!!After my lunch at Sanpoutei today, I was taken to PS Cafe at Palais Renaissance. I walked by a display of cakes. They are not necessary the kind of cakes I like but still...FOOD 3/5I suggested we both shared the Flourless Orange Cake with Orange butterscotch sauce. It would be too much for me to polish that whole cake. The cake came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was alright. Nothing to write home about. The Oreo milkshake was good, but is it even possible to mess up a milk shake?AMBIENCE 3/5My first impression of this caf\u00e9? There are so many steps in this place. It is crazy!! I should put a PSA here. This place is not wheelchair friendly. It is not friendly to anyone who has mobility issue. It was rather crowded when we entered the caf\u00e9. It was a lovely place with lots of greenery. I wanted to love the place but.. the back of leather couch was leaning on the back of another couch sat by another patron. It was not the heaviest chair, so I was extra careful making sure my couch remained in place and not disturb the patron behind me. I was not comfortable throughout my dessert session. The patrons behind me were not as considerate as I hoped to be. SERVICE 4/5I took off a star since it was so hard to holler down a staff to take our order. Other than that, the staffs were nice and polite. Would I return to this PS Caf\u00e9 for anything? I doubt it. I have taken a good look at the menu, no wonder my sis spent over $100 for breakfast. The price is on the high end (think 5 star hotel pricing)and I am not sure if the food is good enough for that kind of \u00a0pricing. I may try it out one of these days. Then again, there are way too many places for me to visit. Maybe just one day...",

I totally forgot that PS CAFE was located at Renaissance. So once my colleague suggested we have dessert there, I was ever too happy to oblige.They have two entrances; one by interior of the mall itself on the second level. It has a protruding doorway due to the extension. Pretty genius. The other entrance was my favourite -- a spiral iron staircase. It starts from the bottom level of the rear entrance of the mall. Overall, a pretty place.They have a brilliant spread of cakes to choose from... but overpriced. A slice of cake for more than $10?! Holy cricket! So their excuse was that they added a scoop of ice-cream on top. Hmm... We ordered a slice of chocolate cake with salted caramel sauce; that came with their promised scoop. Nice. Luckily it's tasty. Otherwise ruckus were in the works. Haha! My colleague can be very loud when she critics a dish. We also ordered mint tea that was shared between the two of us. It was served in a press pot. Loved it. Mint is always my favourite of flavours when it comes to tea. It quite complimented our cake.Service can be improved though. The waiters can be quite unfriendly during the peak hour. I would have given them a 4-star rating, but considering the service and pricing... let's just be neutral.",

I feel have something for everyone and their meals come across healthy and fresh. They always have specials up on the board which is what usually takes my fancy but its the cakes that win people over every. single. time. I'll always be a fan of the PS chain of restaurants.

I'm a huge fan of truffle fries and I order it almost every single time I end up in a restaurant with truffle fries on the menu. Seriously give the truffle fries here a try. I had the P.S. House salad, and added the rosemary-honey dijon chicken. I think this was one of maybe like 3 times in my life I've ever felt satisfied after eating a salad without craving a burger or something. The salad was well balanced and I love the dressing. The chicken was very well seasoned and surprisingly tender.The food was excellent, but I must mention that the service was not fantastic. We put our names down on their iPad checkin system, but we waited for half an hour without being seated even though the place had a couple of empty tables. We went up there and asked a server how long more we would have to wait (we were the only customers waiting), and she said another half an hour in a pretty flippant manner and walked away. We got pretty confused then, since we were told that the wait was half an hour pretty much half an hour earlier, and now we're supposed to wait another half an hour? When she came back we told her our name was in the system, and only then she led us to a free table.My friend ordered the same salad as I did, and told them to leave out the rocket. The waiter noted that down and said it was no problem. When the salad came surprise surprise it came chock full of rocket leaves. We called the waiter back and he said the kitchen premixes the salad, so they couldn't take it out. Well before I get started on a kitchen that premixes a $25 salad, if you can't take out the rocket at least let us know before you serve it and ask if we're still ok with having it.I only took away 1 star because the food is good although it is pricey, but I really hope the service improves.",

Opulent, secluded, sexy and alluring...but I just wish that the main meals were worth forking out big dollars for. Sadly, it's a case of - you're largely paying for the killer ambiance.The Green Goddess Pasta ($26.00) was painfully under seasoned - it's a rather unique take on the traditional pesto sauce but not a dish that I would recommend anybody ordering. Even their famous Truffle Fries ($12.00) were awful today; cold, even before they hit the table and without the slightest hint of truffle, or salt for that matter.The cocktails were the redeeming factor of our visit, I highly recommend trying the White Bouquet Sangria ($18.00) or the Green Apple Mojito ($16.00)After this experience, I'd say that PS. Ann Siang Hill or PS. Petit in Tiong Bahru are definitely better options. If you can stomach the subpar food, all PS outlets have \u00a0a vibe and decor that trumps many other cafes and restaurants. But when it comes to Palais, like I said - you'd be better off sticking to late night drinks and desserts.",

    "text": "Everyone had been raving about this restaurant so eating here was a no-brainer. It's conveniently located in Palais Renaissance so I stopped by after a haircut (there are several salon's here that are all excellent by the way), hoping for a quick bite. In short, the food was fantastic, but the service was terrible.I have two pet peeves when dining out. My first has to be the impatient server. You know the kind: talking to you while not talking to you, looking boredly around the room while in conversation with you. This was the first impression we had as the server took our orders.We stopped here for a quick bite with the intention of the meal being, well, 'quick.' It was anything but. After we were seated and our orders taken, we were virtually ignored for an hour or two. Not just us, but the entire section where we were seated. A little odd, especially since it was barely even half full, and there were always at least five servers standing at the entrance talking to each other. And every time we would try to hail a waiter, it would take several minutes, despite there being no other tables being served.My second pet peeve has to be specific inconsistent attention. What I mean by this is when you are virtually ignored for your entire meal, only to have a server on winged feet when paying for the check. Unfortunately, this was again what happened during our visit to this restaurant. As soon as I asked for the bill, the server speedily appeared, and remained hovering until it was paid.To be fair though, the food was excellent. The burger had just the right amount of juices flowing with each bite, and every plate was picked clean. The smoothie I ordered tasted a little bland, but maybe I was just regretting not ordering the milkshake.As we walked out, my girlfriend mentioned that the other branch she had visited of the same chain had much better service. Or maybe just service in general, especially considering the one here was virtually nonexistent. With that in mind, I would gladly recommend this chain, just not this particular location. And after skimming through some of the other reviews, one easily can find many examples of bad service and questionable management.Good food, overall, but when you're paying high prices for such bad service, why bother? Especially when you really are spoiled for choice in the food heaven that is Singapore.",

    "text": "There are several PS cafe outlets but the one at Palais Renaissance remains my favorite. It's the perfect place to hang out after a day of shopping and it's quiet (Harding is really noisy) and airy (unlike the claustrophobic Paragon and A.S.H outlets). There's a choice of outdoor seating which is a good option if the weather is not overly humid. It looks good and smells good. Boy do i love the lilies in the toilet.The food at PS is not fantastic though the portions are huge. I like the crab tart (which is only served at Palais). Their quiche (varies from day to day) is a hit and miss- \u00a0dry tart and the tart to filling ratio isn't perfect (too much of the former). Their brunch menu is also rather forgettable. So why do i keep going back? For the desserts of course! Their cakes are quite consistent and so far they haven't failed me when i have a sweet craving. I love the steamed apple pudding with butterscotch sauce and real vanilla ice cream. Tender juicy caramelized apple chunks on top of a warm brown sponge that soaks up that butterscotch sauce and neutralized with a fragrant vanilla ice cream- it's an explosion of taste and texture. This is only available at Palais as well (another reason to go there!). I don't like their sticky date pudding at Harding, too much of the date skin which really scratches the throat. Dates are also too sweet for my liking.",

Cafe branches and this is certainly one of the most elegant outlets. \u00a0There is a lot of natural light, high windows, and bountiful bouquets at the entrance and in the restrooms. \u00a0While I wish we could have made reservations for brunch (for some reason, the person on the phone said I couldn't make lunch reservations), we didn't wait more than 15 minutes on Saturday for a group of 6 people.The food:Truffle fries = french fries + parmesan cheese + truffle oilThis is possibly my favorite item here and certainly one we get for the table every time. There is a great truffle flavor with a nice savory bite and bits of parmesan cheese.Otherwise, there is a wide range of brunch and lunch options here. \u00a0I've had everything from the large burger with egg and steak cut fries to the \"leftovers\" lasagne with tons of vegetables, basil pesto and mozzarella (the vegetables are mildly overdone). \u00a0The sandwiches, including the turkey and brie sandwich with cranberry sauce, are savory and have interesting and complimentary flavors.I ALWAYS want to have dessert here because the desserts are beautifully displayed by the entrance. \u00a0I may not manage to save enough room for dessert, but I have enjoyed them when I did plan ahead. \u00a0The apple galette is light and mildly sweet and the profiteroles have a nice chocolate sauce. \u00a0I really like the toffee sauce on the sticky date pudding, though I have found the dates to be a little overwhelming at times.I don't hesitate to come here, except that it gets pricey. \u00a0Entrees are in the 20s while desserts hover somewhere in the teens. \u00a0Expect to pay up when you're here, but also expect good food in a lovely setting.",

    "text": "Decent chain restaurant for Brunch. There are a few locations, but the one I went to is P.S. Cafe Palais in the Tanglin area. This place would be a lot more enjoyable if we didn't have to break our wallets on our meals and drinks, but it's okay to spoil yourself once in a while right? I would recommend making a reservation an hour or so in advance on the weekends during prime brunch time. We had to wait about 45 minutes to get a table, but they had a good selection of magazines to skim through while our party waited for our table. Either choose to eat a meal or a small appetizer with dessert because the desserts are HUGE!! The chocolate cake, which is on the counter as you walk in, is humongous! My friend ordered this after her meal, and it was basically a meal in itself so she only ate half of it. The food is pretty westernized and has an American style - burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc. There is a decent variety. I had the Soup & Sandwich combination (S$24). I had the 'Garlic Oregano Grilled Veggie, Feta & Pumpkin Pesto' sandwich on Crushed wheat & Pumpkin Seed bread with the \u00a0Portobello Mushroom soup. The sandwich was pretty decent, but not the best. I enjoyed the pumpkin bread, but the contents inside the sandwich were a bit bland. The mushroom soup had a weird fishy taste, so I didn't really enjoy it too much. My friend's ordered the P.S. Caesar Salad with chicken and the P.S. Crispy Onion Burger, which were both pretty big portions as well. Our drinks were really fresh and perfectly sweet, and it was a great start to our casual Sunday. I had the Red Strawberry Sangria and it was a lot larger than I expected it to be, and it came with an assortment of fruit inside. My favorite drink was the Burnt Peach Cooler. The peach slices were the icing on the cake! I would probably come back one more time to try the famous truffle fries and some more cocktails! :)",
