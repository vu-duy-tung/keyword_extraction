    "text": "My favourite hawker centre of all time. Why does anybody go to Newton? This is THE shit. There's everything here including great kway chap (Blanco Court), char kway teow (Lao Fu Zi), lor mee (Xin Mei Xiang) and Hokkien mee (Nam Sing). Also the now famous Lao Ban beancurd with its equally crazy queues. The only downside about eating at a food centre like this with so many all-stars: I can't think of any other food centre where you have to queue so much, no matter what you are ordering! On the bright side, even if you didn't want to queue for the 'famous' stalls, the less famous stalls which offer the same types of food tend to be quite good too. Nothing really sucks, I think. Not sure if that's a safe proclamation to make.My new favourite stall here is the under-rated Chuan Loo Bee Hokkien stall which is opposite the Lao Ban beancurd stall. It sells some of the best -- and cheapest -- seafood and zichar I have ever seen. I love the black pepper crabs, hotplate egg omelette and beancurd and pretty much everything they've got. Wash down the huge feast (any combination of things here, put together, necessarily constitutes a feast!) with a beer or sugar cane juice and mark it down as the quintessential Singapore experience. Do your tourist friends a favour and take them here, not Newton!",

All my favourite foods in a hawker centre-space just slightly larger than Maxwell Market, packed with the famous Hougang Wan Ton Mee, Lao Ban Tau Huey, delicious traditional Chinese desserts (like the pastes, chng tng, gingko barley soup), bak kut teh, tze char, Lor Mee (!!!), Chicken Rice, Pig Organ Soup (not my cup of tea but fans love the ones here!), complete with fruit juice & drink vendors thrown in (and the occasional duplicate/bandwagon stores, which are totally legit and yummy as well!). Easy to get to, Dakota/Mountbatten MRT, 20 minute bus ride from the city... envious of people who live in the vicinity and get to have all these local delicacies in their disposal till late in the night...",

    "text": "Lots of good eats within one place! I'd always heard about the wonders of Old Airport Rd hawker centre but never traipsed over east-ish (it's actually not that far east, even) to try it out. But since a colleague from abroad was here visiting, we made the pilgrimage down! 1. Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow #01-12 (2nd row of stalls, kind of in the middle) is certainly da bomb.. Deliciousness! $3 for a plate, not an overwhelming lot, but probably enough saturated fats to last for a while, unfortunately. Noodles were well fried and slid down your throat, with a suitable amount of sweetness from the sweet black soy. This stall has a combination of kway teow noodles (the flat rice noodles) and thick round yellow noodle (I can't figure out the name, unfortunately, this website calls it ), which isn't found everywhere. My two female colleagues baulked when they saw me approaching the table with 2 plates of $3 noodles (this, as recommended by an uncle standing in line in front of me when I asked for a $5 plate- he convinced me that 2 $3 plates was more worth it - I guess it's true! Didn't make the lady boss any happier, certainly). However, the six of us devoured almost all of it..2. Mattar Seafood Barbecue #01-63 (3rd row of stalls, right at the back)a. Chilli crab was not bad, colleagues liked it a lot and preferred it to Jumbo's. It is also cheaper, at $40/kg. We got 2 for $61, not too bad I guess! And yay for mantous.. 50cents each. Although still can't beat the Forture Seafood ones. Those are gigantic and fluffy and heaven on earth!b. Stir fried greens with mushrooms ($8) was also pretty good - we just asked for whatever green veg they had and she supplied us with puay leng (chinese spinach) with mushrooms with a delicate light sauce! c. Sambal stingray ($16) from them was unfortunately so-so, the stingray was okay but the sambal was somewhat lacklustre. Pity about that!3. Guan Kee Seafood (#01-66) a. Cereal prawns ($13 \u00a0I think) were delicious! I forget how many prawns they gave us though.b. Pork ribs king ($12) was not that great. Tender pieces, but not much flavour.",

With a wide variety of stalls all housed under one roof, this place is home of my favourite hokkien mee, wan ton mee and hand made cheong fun. There is also the hugely popular Lao Ban tau huay alongside many traditional dessert stalls. The hokkien mee in the 3rd row, can't remember what it is called exactly, is absolutely divine! However, the wait for it can go up to 1.5 hours during busy periods!It gets pretty crowded on weekends and finding a table and parking can be pretty difficult, so planning for an early dinner/lunch may help you avoid some of the crowd.",

    "text": "Oh the sinful memories. I used to work very near Old Airport Road and had lunch there almost everyday. I believe this should be stated as a major job perk if my office was hiring.The place's divided into 3 rows. My colleagues and I always call it row 1 - facing the road, 2 or 3 - against the wall to differentiate the stalls.There's a wonderfully juicy chicken chop at row 3, the chicken is succulent and never fails to emerge with glistering skin and an intoxicating grilled aroma. On the same row, there's a small stall that sells goreng pisang and fried nian gao (aka rice cake) and fried - get this - DURIAN. It is amazing. In row 1, there are two battling stalls of wanton mee, apparently each stall has their own loyal following - can tell from the queue.The thing about hawker food is that everything's so affordable; every meal there can easily spiral out of control and become a little feast. Not that I'm complaining.",

My colleagues pick the cantonese porridge and Western food stall.I'm only ranking this a-ok because I think I need to explore this place more before I make my decision.",

It is also very huge - spanning 3 rows of stalls in a space that is probably the size of a football field or bigger.Seating will be a challenge most times especially on weekends. However this is when group work comes in. One can sit, the others can start to queue to buy the food.Of course the famous Lao Ban beancurd will come to mind since they originated here. However there are also other notable stalls such as Lao Fu Zi fried kway teow and Whitley Road Big Prawn noodles. The TPY Rojak and Hokee Wanton Noodles are also very good. The Western BBQ stall also has great chicken chops.If you are unsure of what to eat, just join the stall with a queue and you can't be wrong.",

Great food and good layout.Highlights:- Chay kway teow: mixed type of noodles in a soy like sauce was a hit. 5 stars.- Hor fun: wide rice noodles with gravy. 5 stars.- Carrot cake: rice patties with egg and a brown sauce was one of my faves. 5 stars- Meatball bao: soft bun and tasty big meatball hiding inside. 4.5 stars- Black pepper puff: didn't care that much about the famous curry puff but loved the black pepper version inside of the thick flaky exterior. 4.5 stars- Fresh juices: so good, I got 3. Blend the fruit with a bit of ice right there. 5 stars- Tofu: silky and just a bit sweet of a dessert. Meant to eat a few spoonfuls but almost ate the whole container. 4.5 stars - Noodles with minced meat: with and without soup with linguine type noodles were great. 4 stars- Layout: 2 long aisles with seating in between and outside under umbrellas Lowlights:- Few stalls closed on Sunday- Need coins to pay last for the toilet - My friend wanted fresh fruit for his kid but couldn't find it anywhere Got my 2 week trip off to an awesome start blissfully happy trying all of these dishes and would love to come back again.",

    "text": "This hawker center is a bit out of the way, but worth the stop if you have time! After visiting a couple of other hawker centers, this one was your typical place of various food stalls and such. Do note, that if you need to go to the restroom, it will cost you ten cents to do so.For most of the food here, the options vary from porridge to pasta to the typical dishes you see at hawker centers. I didn't know what to get so I conducted a small experiment. Instead of ordering whatever looks good to me, I simply chatted with some of the locals and ordered food based on their recommendations. Result? Everything I got was DELICIOUS. One of my favorite items was the Thai style noodle dish with wonton soup. The stall was located in a dark ish looking corner of the place. The wonton soup = yummylicious. The broth was perfectly seasoned and the wontons itself were savory and filling. For only $4, you get both the wonton soup + the noodles. Noodle dish was quite tasty, with the fresh cut BBQ pork and the seasonings on the dish wasn't too overwhelming. For other small dishes I tried, I really enjoyed the curry flavored puff and the fried dumpling. For the puff, the outside was nice and flaky while the inside tasted legitimately like good Thai yellow curry with its potatoes and chicken. As for the fried dumpling, this was surprisingly filling! The inside was mostly chicken, potatoes and small veggies and it had a nice spicy kick to it.Overall, I really like the vibe of this place. You don't see too many tourists and the locals are friendly and nice to talk to. Not sure if it was the time we went (late afternoon), but there was hardly a long wait (except for one stall in particular) for most of the food stalls. Definitely a relaxing eating experience at this hawker center.",

We were on the hunt for my new local favorite Singapore dish, Char Kway Teow and settled on unit#1 30. The stall was named Lucky and their specialty was spelled differently as Char Kuay Tiao. Minor details aside, we ordered two plates of Char Kway Teow with chili. The drink stall across the crowded way crammed with tables and people was playing Classic Rock and had Carlsberg on special offer. We also ordered a couple of drinks from the juice stall beside our Lucky stall. The food was great. Great flavor of cockles, Chinese chives, bean sprouts and flat noodles all cooked in light and dark soy sauce. Just the right amount of spiciness and a good sized portion. What's not to love. Washed down with Carlsberg and Soursop and Plum juice listening to old Aerosmith and ACDC, our visit was a resounding success. Cannot wait to go back.",

The tried a lime juice fresh from the cold drink stall. Also amazing! Totally refreshing and not too sour/tart. \u00a0Lastly grabbed a hot red paste bun from the only place selling hot buns in there which was so fluffy and perfectly hot and topped with sesame seeds, white and black. \u00a0I will definitely be back! All for the low low price of 4.90 for all of the above :)",

The huge compound holds more than a hundred stalls ranging from savory to sweet, small snacks to hearty meals, local to western cuisine.Some hot favorites are the 2 competing wanton mee stores at the left end of the complex. Cho Kee and another stall. They even have their electronic queue display.There is a hand made chee cheong fun stall (i'm not sure what's its name). It's in the second block, the second row from the main road. There's always a long queue for this one. Melt in your mouth rice rolls with char siew or prawns or scallops and topped with a light soy and shallots. Yums.Other great stuff includes lor mee, Lao Ban beancurd, Albert Street Prawn mee and more. Char Kway teow is apparently very popular too.",

    "text": "I used to come here a lot when I was in Secondary school. So this place brings back lots of memories.Seems like everyone is raving about the CKT.. so here's my take on two of them.Let me start with Lucky Char Kway Teow. According to the owner, the stall has been in operation for seven years and they have various recommendations as seen plastered around the stallfront. The CKT here is less than saucy i.e. dry in a good way. I like that the lupcheong (chinese sausages) were given in ample amounts and the taste was strong and distinct from the rest of the noodles. The noodles were pleasant and would give it a 3.5-4 stars.Opposite Lucky on the second last row of stalls on the west side of the hawker center is Laofuzi CKT(with a green sign). There's always a queue regardless of the time of the day and many have sworn by this CKT. I find wouldn't drive like hours to just eat this.. its just okay. The noodles are quite delicious when eaten hot, and the 'hum'/ cockle just rounds off the taste. I love hums.No trip to OARFC is complete without Laoban soya bean. There's 51 a competitor and much cheaper but the taste at Laoban is just superior. It has a strong bean taste that some may call 'plasticky?' but i really like it. Choose the small cup ($1) of soy bean milk for a filling and wholesome thirst-quencher.",

    "text": "A must go when visiting Singapore! I absolutely loved the vibe of the place, which is where you can go to see how the locals eat. Food is so inexpensive, at 2-3 USD a plate. Lines stretch over half an hour for the most popular stalls at peak times. Definitely try the famous Hougang Mee noodles, the Hougang Otah, Fatman Satay (only evenings), Fish Soup, Char Kway Teow and Fried Oyster Omelette stalls! Many of the stalls at this food center have been opened for over 30 years, although few retain their original owners to this date. The food is still super tasty!Also, the crazy line at the back of the food center is probably for Lao Ban bean curd dessert and soy drinks, I've seen more than 40 people lining up and their product is really different than other local versions. This one has an almond taste to it and a very custard texture, which is unlike the soy milk quality that their competitors produce. Beat the crowd by going at 11am or 530pm before the locals come eat! Payment is always in cash and local currency, so leave your credit cards at home.",

It's called Nam Sing, and it's store number #01-32 and you MUST call him first at +65 6440 5340 before coming. If the uncle doesn't pick up the phone, don't bother coming. If he picks up the phone, make sure you ask if there are still a lot of noodles left. I had the unfortunate experience when I made sure that they were open, but they were sold out by the time I got there!Other than Nam Sing, there are several other famous stalls here such as:- Xin Mei Xiang Lor Mee- Lao Fu ZI Kway Teow- Toa Payoh Rojak- Lao Ban Soya BeancurdEtc etcBut for me, I always go for the Hokkien mee. IMO the best in Singapore, where the noodles is very eggy and it's cooked like an al dente pasta.",

The macik is the best, she is super nice and used to remember our faces when we came over for lunch. That being said, I only remember her being opened till the mid afternoon. Never saw the place open for dinner.But I digress. This is hands-down one of the best briyanis on the island. The rice is fragrant and goes super well with the curry they used. The fried chicken and it's little fried scraps are tasty and fresh. Be sure to ask for veg and the papadum as well, she was out of veg when I got there at 2pm.Nevertheless, always worth the visit.Selera Rasa is located in the corner of old airport road food center.

Quite packed and a bit difficult to find seat for a large group but nonetheless a good place to visit to immerse in the true local experienceReviews of some popular stalls I have been to per the below.- Dong Ji Fried Kuay Teow - the stir-fried noodle here has a nice wok smell but the line is long and moves slowly so gotta be patient- Lao Fu Zi Fried Kuay Teow - another fried kuay teow stall - this one has a stronger walk smell than Dong Ji but I personally prefer Dong Ji's seasoning of the noodle. A very good option nonetheless but super long slow line since they cook one dish at a time - Wen Wen Prawn Mee - average - nothing particularly special- Roast Paradise - really good BBQ pork - recommend- Nam Sing Hokkien Mee - usually I'm not a big fan of Hokkien Mee but this one is good - the noodle is not too soggy from the gravy and there's a hint of wok smell in the sauce. Long line.- Chuan kee satay - Ok / despite its popularity, I have had better satay elsewhere- Toa Payoh Rojak - personally not a Rojak fan but this is one of the better ones I have had - the ingredients were fresh and well-balanced. If you order with chili, it can indeed get spicy- Hua Kee Wanton Meat - good / comforting wonton noodles - not mindblowing but a safe good bet- 51 Soya Bean - a good place for traditional SG/Chinese dessert - try the tao huey (cold tofu pudding)- Sugar Cane Juice - a classic SG refreshment for a hot day",

Seriously though, the prawn mee is amazingly delicious- a really unique and complex mix of flavors in one broth. Also, get the Or Chein (oyster omelette) at Xing Li Cooked Food. And if you have a sweet tooth and want something to cool down with away from the heat and humidity, Nyona Chendol is good- I like the original, but adding red beans looks just as good. Everything here is cheap, relatively speaking. Old Airport Road is popular and a bit more touristy, but also a little further away from town, so if you're a visitor, you should just call a taxi (MRT is always good, but not everyone has the time or patience to check routes and stops). If you're a tourist with little to no exposure to Singaporean and Malaysian food, most of the food here will probably seem to be delicious to you. More often than not, if there's a long line for one particular hawker, the food is good. But seriously, no trip Singapore would be complete without visiting a good ole food court.",

To get here, you'll need to take the MRT to \"Dakota\" stop and it's along the Circle (YELLOW) Line. This place is pretty huge. The first floor are the hawker stalls and the 2nd floor are mainly shops selling goods.Stalls that we tried:-Roast Paradise [Stall #01-121]: They offer roasted pig and char siew dishes. Our meals costed 4 SGD each.-Hong Hua Dessert [Stall #01-86]: They offer a variety of shaved iced desserts. We shared the \"Ice Kachang\" and it costed 1.50 SGD.-We also got the sugar cane drink. But, I don't recall what stall it was.Not bad overall. I wanted to try Chau Kee Satay [Stall #01-85], but they only open in the evenings. I also wanted to try Lao Ban Soya Beancurd [Stall #01-127] again, but I was already too full to eat anymore (Note: I tried their tofu dessert at Maxwell tho].

It's a pretty popular hawker (a term that means Chinatown complex) where you have two long rows of many different food options. FYI, it's hard to find napkins there so bring some with you. It was also hard for me to find trash bins so I found one attached to a juice stand and threw my trash there. I got scolded though since they could get fined for having random trash items in there. Very odd. Anywho, I ordered some prawn noodles and dessert from two of the stands and left pretty full and satisfied. Another great eating place to come back for sure and try other stands!They also have wifi there so that's a major plus!",

They bring the food straight to your table number when it's ready. \u00a0Even when you pay for beer, they bring the bottles to your table too. \u00a0Absolutely great food and experience.",

The sugar cane juice here is pretty decent and refreshing. $1.50 a cup. Western Barbeque #53Supposedly a famous stall, and they serve each plate with bun all wrapped up in plastic, very old school. We ordered, chicken, pork and lamb. All were tender and juicy. The sunny side up was perfect too.Jogurtz #129A newly opened froyo stall on the back row, serves small $3.50 or large $5 cups, to be honest, both small and large cups seems to have the same amount of froyo, just more toppings in the large cup. The small sized cup seems to be at least a medium sized Llao Llao cup. It's more icy and slightly more sour than other competitors but it is very refreshing to eat this after alot of bbq and greasy food.Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow \u8001\u592b\u5b50\u7092\u7cbf\u6761 #12Probably one of the most famous stalls in Old Airport Road, the queue grows quickly but the uncle also cooks quickly. The stall can be recognized by the music playing out of the boombox, and the auntie who takes orders very quickly. You can be the 10th person down the line and she's asking for your order! The kway teow was very wet and wasn't too oily, the flavour was there and I didn't eat chunks of lard but I could definitely taste the use of lard.Xing Li Cooked Food \u5174\u5229\u719f\u98df #28Fried OysterAs mentioned by fellow yelper Dominic C, the fried egg is very gooey and isn't crispy, the cook definitely takes his own sweet time to cook the fried egg.Jia Long Mei Shi #55Chicken WingsThe chicken wings were juicy and good, the auntie was very friendly and there was no queue. Got the food quickly and ate it quickly as well! Not a bad choice for chicken wings!Kah Ping Ri Ye Xiang #87RojakLots of big dough fritter pieces, all were crispy despite taking my time to slowly finish up the plate. The chilli can be quite spicy so beware. Lots of crushed peanut in every mouthful!Ming Kee Fuzhou Fish Balls #109 (facing main road)Fuzhou fish balls have meat embedded in the fish ball which is nice! The meatballs are soft and bouncy and very flavourful. The soup is slightly more bland and comes with a small seaweed. They are served in portions of 6.",

Get there after 2pm, the stall will be closed.There are at least two prawn noodle stalls here, again you have to decide which one is your favourite.Luckily there is only one rojak stall, get a queue number before you start your entree as the queue is super long.Don't forget the char koay thoew as well as the carrot cake.

I could've shied away from the chilli but I figured it wouldn't do the dish justice if I skipped it. The dumplings were stuffed to the brim and delicious. Throw in the copious amount of al dente noodles in a bowl and it is BEST.#01-12: Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway TeowI love Char Kway Teow and am not very particular with my stalls. Just know this one does the dish justice.#01-51: Waan WaanThis is a Thai dessert spot that does coconut ice cream. Their dishes are quite refreshing in this Singapore heat; however they do try to upsell me sometimes even though I tell them straight up that I'm not interested... not a fan of that.Next time I want to try some of the curry puff stalls and the banana fritter stall in the back!",

    "text": "My favourite hawker in Singapore in terms of choice (although Chinatown Complex has the craft beer stalls in its favour). Worth noting there is a covered path all the way there from Dakota MRT (but not Mountbatten). I'll update the list over time. Best:- Yi Ji vs Nam Sing (fried hokkien mee): both are worth trying. I personally prefer the fishier, sweeter Yi Ji and its pungent chilli. There's something fun about the brusk service as well. Nam Sing is an impressively professional operation and the prawns have a slight edge. - Geylang Lor 20 banana fritters: looks unassuming but these are very sweet, soft bananas. Love it. I'm not a fan of the larger, less ripe pisang goreng though.- Lim Hin fruits/juice: the soursop juice (\"classic\") is phenomenal. This stall is supposed to be quite picky with their fruit and it shows. Good soursop is one of the best things about living here. I never thought a simple soursop juice would make my \"top 10 meals of 2017\" list.OK:- Lao Fu Zi char kway teow (black): not as much wok hei as I'd have imagined from the giant wok, perhaps because outside rush hour. Still, this CKT has good ingredients and is on the sweet side. Can't wait to try Dong Ji. - Sin Thor Bak Koot Teh: a well executed, but not standout braised pig leg. I'm biased due to the closure of the two BKT stalls near my home, meaning any BKT finds favour at the moment.",

One such average food stall is #01-91 which sells congee or rice porridge. There are many varieties of porridge available and it does see a steady stream of customer who usually get it to go. I like the options available for the century egg pork porridge. You could choose meatball or meat slices (I think). I had the meatball which was lovely. It came with a you tiao stick which was still crispy. The dish not to order would be the raw fish salad. The small portion was miserable. One could hardly see the fish slices which were so thin they almost blended in with the disposable plate. I guess I am used to the versions served in Chinatown Food Center or even at Tekka Market Food Center which were more generous and cheaper too.",

There is incredible variety of food, but I'm going to give a review specifically of Wen Wen pork rib prawn Mee stall 01-147. We had a steamboat of crab, prawns, clams, pork ribs, intestines and pig tails. The base stock was crazy good with intense flavors of prawn and pork. After the ingredients were eaten, the stock became extra rich with even more intense flavors, this time with crab and clams into the mix. The owner is Richard, a thoroughly nice guy. The place and ambience is well, hawker center. But here you can also bring your own stuff, vegetables, abalone or whatever and just throw into the pot. Richard won't charge you extra. Highly recommended and very affordable. One hint, better come before October 2017 as he will move to Kallang market.",
