    "text": "For all that I've heard about PS Cafe while in Singapore, my one experience proved it's overrated. Service is a joke, you'll spend more time flagging down a waiter than actually consuming your average tasting food.The truffle fries weren't the best I've had, but the fries were thin and crispy and while it could have been more balanced with the truffle topping, it itself was delicious.I ordered the mushroom croque monsieur as my main as a reco from a colleague- also just \"good\", but overly cheesy and blocked any flavor coming from the three different kinds mushrooms in the dish. The sourdough bread however is delicious. Perhaps worth a one time visit, but this location is overly crowded, especially during lunch time \u00a0so be wary of the wait.",

I enjoyed the automated queue system which notifies you by a phone call when your table is ready. You can also check how many tables are ahead of you to estimate your wait time!I usually enjoy open kitchen set ups but this one was not well-ventilated and ended up spreading intense smells into the dining area. With the recent haze situation, my nose is especially sensitive, and my throat and nose were annoyed.We had to wave at the servers to get their attention, and also had to wait a long time before our food arrived. The servers only refilled our waters after long periods of time..That said, even though the venue and servers were really disappointing.. the food was as good as ever. TRUFFLE FRIES. one of the best i've had in Singapore and the U.S. Although there were some overfried ones, the flavors are still so delicious! I also had the honey and lemon hot drink, and that was nice and smoothing for the week.I probably will not go back to this branch of PS Cafe. It is in one of the most busy areas in orchard, and probably that's why there is such a wait even after lunch hours!",

    "text": "I stop by PS Cafe at Paragon on Orchard somewhat frequently these days because I'm in that area a lot and it can be tough to find food that fits my Paleo lifestyle anywhere else. They have an electronic queue system at the hostess stand that is user-friendly and you will get a text or call when your table is ready if they have a wait. In the meantime, you can wander around Paragon and get some shopping done. I've found you have to grab the employees attention when you are notified your table is ready. They tend to not really look at you otherwise.The food here is on par with all of the PS Cafe locations I have visited. I really enjoy their veggies with three dips and the long blacks are actually sizable here. No problem getting honey on the side for the Paleo coffee drinkers. I ordered the Brioche and Portobello Stack for breakfast. They wouldn't substitute the bread for anything else like tomatoes or potatoes, which I found pretty limiting. I skipped the cheese and actually found the portion to be a decent size, even without the bread. Service was friendly, but we had to ask our server for my husband's truffle fries a few times in addition to flagging them down to take our credit card after dropping the check. They just seemed a bit frazzled. Overall, it gets a 3.5 in my book for not being more flexible with healthy substitutions and for having to constantly flag down servers. I'll keep going back just because not everything on their menu is fried and the location is very convenient.",

    "text": "3.5 stars, but rounding it up to 4 stars.For some odd reason, I am angry whenever I enter this shop. Angry, or perhaps hangry (angry+hungry). Bc I'm only really hangry for the first 30-40 minutes. Service is so damn slow!!! Though the PS.Cafe here isn't as busy as the one on Dempsey or Club Street, you still really need to flag down waiters. My friends and I came here after a morning run at MacRitchie, starving! Hangry! And dizzy (bc of the accommodated amount of lactic acid in our stomachs)! We had to ask the waitress three times for water before it was brought to us, about 20 minutes after we sat down. It was cucumber-flavored water so we were pleasantly surprised and a bit less hangry. Our hangry level spiked again when we saw a table that ordered after us being served their mains! Excuse me! We havent even gotten our appetizer yet! We ordered one burger, two salads, and veggies & dips....how hard and long do they take to prepare? After staring miserably and hangrily at each other for the next 10 minutes, our food came out...fantastic! I loved the presentation and the food was delicious! The salads were nutritious and large! Super filling though at SGD 18, it was quite steep but worth every penny. My favorite is the lemongrass ginger--lemongrass dressing with fresh shaved ginger on a bed of pea sprouts, snap peas, bean sprouts, carrots, and chicken? YUM! I've tried to recreate this recipe many times, but I just can't get the tartness right. This salad def. grants PS.Cafe a few more visits. The Veg & Dip (SGD 22) is quite expensive, but the richness of the dips (especially the hummus) makes it worth it. Plus, the veggies are so fresh and you just feel GOOD eating here. \u00a0 \u00a0But, ugh. Service in Singapore. There's a rant coming along, but I'll save it for another day since my belly was full with delicious food instead of simply lactic acid. I know I shouldn't be angry, but I really wasn't. I was just hangry.",

I would request a seat inside if you want a more intimate experience. Back to dessert, I really dig the steamed ginger pudding with the earl grey creme anglaise. The ginger cake is wonderfully moist and the creme anglaise has the right amount of sweetness balanced by the tea. Very satisfying.A little pricier but serving sizes are larger. Just the steamed ginger pudding is reason enough for a return visit.",

    "text": "P.S. Cafe in Paragon is rather small as compared to other branches. There are like 2 separate area and both are quite cramped. If you're planning to catch up with friends, maybe it's a good idea to sit at the outside area (the one opp of escalators) as it is rather less echoey. Much like what others said, we do need to catch the attention of the waiters despite the fact the waiter was like right across us. Nevertheless, they are still attentive and warm once you caught their attention. We tried their truffle fries and banana cheesecake, along with some coffee drinks. The truffle fries was good.. It was truffle-y enough (if such word exists) but not too overwhelming, which is my main complain about truffle fries at other establishments. The banana cheesecake was a let down, however. It was decent enough but does not have that oomph factor to make it memorable or outstanding. The coffee beverages were also quite meh as I find it a bit too acidic without the distinct coffee smell (almost felt like the beans are stale). Then again, I'm just very particular about how my coffee should be done, so each to his or her own in this case.Overall, P.S. Cafe at Paragon is a nice place to sit down and catch up with your friends in the middle of Orchard.",

I'll usually go for the turkey cranberry sandwich, or one of the burgers - portions are big, and quality is assured. Prices are also steep, but that's true in all P.S. branches. There's usually not much room to stomach dessert after, but the sticky date pudding is not to be missed. Just spend some time over a pot of tea, and you'll be good for round two in a bit.
