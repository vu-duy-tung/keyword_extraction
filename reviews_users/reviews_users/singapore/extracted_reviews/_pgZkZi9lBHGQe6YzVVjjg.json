    "text": "Sunday lunch time and by accident I turned into a courtyard with many different restaurants and bars.The Mexican caught my eye and I had no trouble finding a table outside in said courtyard.The offer for a set lunch with soup, main dish and brownie / ice cream for desert - 18S$ - had to be checked out.Portions are not too big but as it's three courses I was still quite stuffed afterwards. Everything was tasty and at least as Mexican as Chilis ;)The waiters were nice and always checked on me, asked before serving the next course etc. They even managed to bring the ice tea without sugar but a little pot with sugar on the side.Really liked the place as you can sit outside in the shade and with a fen if you like. The food is good and inexpensive, the staff really nice, so where else to go for a lazy Sunday lunch and some book reading?",

I came here on a Friday night with Michelle M. and there was a small band jamming and singing in Spanish! What a perfect way to start our TexMex adventure. We ordered nachos, crab enchiladas, beef burrito, and beef tacos. I didn't try the beef burrito, but the crab enchiladas and beef tacos deserve an ole! The enchilada sauce wasn't as flavorful as I would like, but it definitely tasted like enchilada sauce so me gusta! It didn't taste much different from Chevy's enchiladas, which I faintly recall. Plus, the nice chunks of crab meat gave it a distinctive local flavor. Kind of like chili crab but no need for messy hands or a bowl of lemon water. The tacos are also worth the $17 as the price included 3 soft shelled tacos, rice, refried beans, and a small salad. Not bad considering Lucha Loco charges $11 for just one taco. The refried beans were also delicioso, def. an item I'll order as a side or even as an appetizer. I'm no nacho lover, but Viva Mexico's nachos blew me away. They came with REAL jalapenos! Nice big, fat vinegary ones! \u00a0 \u00a1Salud! I was so happy I almost burst into tears...do you know how difficult it is to find jalapenos in Singapore?? My homemade Mexican food just doesn't taste the same without them. Viva Mexico (and Subway, I guess), tell me who your distributor is, por favor! I need them jalapenos! This certainly isn't the best TexMex I've had in my life, but for Singapore, I'm thoroughly impressed. For the price, atmosphere, and food--me encanta! For those who really crave Mexican food, visit Siem Reap, Cambodia. \u00a1Mi numero uno!",

    "text": "This a a review of a Tuesday evening dinner with a friend at Viva Mexico.First, I want to be clear, \u00a0in California, this would NOT be a four star review. \u00a0For a Mexican or Tex-Mex restaurant, It might only be a two star review. \u00a0But I am not in California and I have to adjust my expectations to where I'm at. I will also note that on their site, Viva Mexico claims to be \u00a0traditional Mexican food and not Tex-Mex. \u00a0While they have some moles, from what I saw of their menu, it is mostly Tex-Mex. \u00a0Plus, the fajitas seem to be pretty popular. \u00a0They are as Tex-Mex as it gets.My goal was to find a place that served decent US chain (El Toritios, etc..) quality Tex-Mex food. \u00a0My mission was a success. \u00a0In almost every way, this is exactly what Viva Mexico is. \u00a0This is true from the ambiance to the food.Speaking of the ambiance; it is festive. \u00a0Well, it is in the festive get out the decorations for taco night sort of way. \u00a0But it sets the mood for having a margarita or two. \u00a0And speaking of margarita's theirs are pretty good. \u00a0Nothing to write home about, but good enough to keep the Viva Mexico mood going. \u00a0It seemed like everyone there was in good spirits and enjoying their meals. \u00a0For me, this was a nice plus to the overall ambiance.The staff was friendly, professional, and prompt. \u00a0This was maintained throughout our meal. \u00a0This even included a moment where the power went out. \u00a0But that was only a very minor hiccup.The food was quite good.Nachos - We started with some nachos. \u00a0We enjoyed them very much. \u00a0I sought out the jalape\u00f1os. \u00a0My friend did everything she could to eat around them. \u00a0The chips were crisp. \u00a0 The cheese was all melted. \u00a0This is all just as it should be.tinyurl.com/bz5eu8nGuacamole - We also ordered a side of guacamole. \u00a0This was also very good. \u00a0There were lots of fresh ingredients. \u00a0They had also insured not to over mix it so there was still some texture.tinyurl.com/aleeo7jFajitas - I ordered chicken. \u00a0She ordered beef. \u00a0I thought both were good. \u00a0I love fajitas. \u00a0I love food where you get to do a little bit of combining and playing while eating. \u00a0Being her first adventure with fajitas, my friend did not embrace this part as much. \u00a0She abandoned the create your own fajita taco and stuck with the fork and knife. \u00a0I thought that both the chicken and beef were cooked well. \u00a0They were both tender and had nice seasoning. \u00a0The veggies were still very crispy. \u00a0All in all - \u00a0two good sets of fajitas.tinyurl.com/abmcj9qOverall - This was a fun meal. \u00a0The food was good. \u00a0The service was pleasant. \u00a0The ambiance was on the festive side. \u00a0Good stuff! \u00a0I will be back.",

    "text": "I have to agree with J N, I'm really struggling to understand why this restaurant has received such great reviews. I don't claim to be a TexMex expert but the \"kitchen sink burrito\", which has received plaudits on both Yelp & Foursquare, was clearly prepared well in advance. The tortilla was stale, as were the nachos we ordered, and this is simply unacceptable. The cardboard-like texture of microwaved corn chips is not something I enjoy, much less am willing to pay for.The main reasons I've given this place two stars instead of one are the service and the vibe. Staff were quite attentive, friendly and hospitable and the al-fresco setting on Cuppage Rd is a winner. This is a great place to have a bucket of Coronas but if you're coming for the food then you will leave disappointed.",

The food was very tasty but having 'grown up' on Mexican, I am a pretty harsh critic. \u00a0We had the fajitas (beef), the crab enchiladas and my oldest daughter had the tacos. All were pretty darn good. \u00a0The beef in the fajitas was especially tasty. The service was good and the price was pretty reasonable too - we had three adult meals, a kids meal, a couple of cocktails and an appetizer for $160. Well worth it! \u00a0I will definitely go back (it was my wife's second time so you know she liked it).",

He ordered the kitchen sink burrito and I the chicken quesadilla. Both of our meals were excellent! He was more impressed then I simply because its been so long! The quesadilla was good, but how can one really mess that up. All in all we had a great dinner, fast service and typical Mexican restaurant ambience. We will be eating here again although prices were high but they are at all restaurants in Singapore. Yum!",
