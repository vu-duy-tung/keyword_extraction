I had the Tunisian breakfast set served in a pan - I loved the seasoning used, and how it looked. You pay at the counter before getting your set. Prepare for a long wait though, as this place is always crowded. More importantly, i liked the cosy cafe setting with nice sofa chairs. What I disliked is the queue!",

The food is quite expensive, but for a schmancy breakfast spot in downtown Singapore, that's to be expected. One thing I really liked was that both of our entrees came out together. In Singapore it is very common for different people at the same table to be served minutes apart, which is a major faux pas in decent restaurants all over the world. My Bloody Mary could have been spicier and had another splash of vodka, but it was still good, and a great compliment to my eggs bennie and fruit.",

When we finally asked about our order, we realized that it never actually went into their system, with the only explanation being a breakdown in their system. When we asked to speak to the manager, the only thing he said was that it must have been a bad day and didn't try to offer anything else to compensate us. When my order finally came, it was incorrect (I asked for sauce on the side and it was piled on top of my order). I used to frequent Wild Honey at Scotts Square, but given this unacceptable experience which is the worst I've had in Singapore, I highly recommend avoiding this place!!",

Are you kidding me?Went there with my gf whose friend is a fan, she made reservations.Even though we had reservations we still had to wait about 10min.They made the reservations process so troublesome but still had to queu up, really? what was the point?Decor is nice, however crowded.Just be prepared to have a packed restaurant and many many kids, so if you are looking for relaxing look elsewhere.Service was so so. Still had to chase down the server for salt, although pepper was readily available on the table. To management: if you offer pepper then ignore the salt?What ticked me off finally was the hostess came and suggested to us there were people still waiting 10 min after we paid our bill. \u00a0I was not aware there was a time limit for brunch, \u00a0really? usher your customers out after they just paid \u00a0a S$117 bill for 3?Maybe its me but for S$40 i would be expecting a much better experience.",

    "text": "How can breakfasts be so expensive? Singaporeans must really love their breakfasts to pay these prices. I skipped the breakfast items (so cannot comment on them, and therefore, I suppose I shouldn't judge the pricing, as the breakfast items could be really crazy good) and ordered a \"chicken salad chop chop\" or something with an equally silly name. Possibly \"chop chop chicken salad\"??Anyway, the salad is NOT like a salad at all. Firstly, there were no greens. Ok, fine, there was some lettuce in the salad. But the lettuce was coated in some brown coloured seasoning (curry powder? no idea). In fact, the entire bowl of \"salad\" was one single colour - brown! Definitely not appetizing and not the fresh, healthy bowl of salad I was expecting. However, having said that, the salad tasted fine and I grew to like the crunchy crackers in the salad. So much for trying to have a healthy meal. In a bid to keep up with my attempt to have a healthy meal, I ordered the mixed beetroot juice - this was expensive, but not too bad, quite tasty and was freshly squeezed, of course.Service was slow. Our glasses of water were not topped up. I'm not used to paying such sky high prices for breakfast food and won't be coming back. It's not like the food I had was that great, or the service, that good. In fact, everything was pretty average to me, down to the ambience. Only advantage I suppose would be the location, although to me, I'd very much prefer a relaxing, quieter cafe to have my breakfast at.",

Two of us arrived 20 minutes early and asked if the table was free for us to go ahead a sit down. We were shown to our table and reminded about the 90 min reservation. We thought that started from our 11:00 reservation time, so no problem. We each ordered a drink, our friend arrived we ordered a second drink and our food. Our second drinks did not come. They came to take our food order and we asked about the drinks. They hadn't made them yet. The food was good as always. At 12:10 they brought the check and asked us to leave for the next reservation who were waiting outside. We said that we had the table until 12:30. She told us that since we came early, the 90 minutes started when we sat down. We did not argue and left. A disappointing experience.",

    "text": "Holiday weekend and we walked to Wild Honey to get a change of pace from The Line at Shangri La. The hostess stand had an iPad where we checked in digitally and received texts regarding the status of our table. The wait time was estimated at 45-60 minutes and we waited only 40 minutes. We walked around the mall and did some shopping to pass the time more quickly, which was a nice change of pace to lingering around the entrance. We received a call when our table was ready and were greeted by a friendly gentleman apologizing for how crazy it was, but we weren't concerned at all because it was a holiday weekend. We were seated at the round counter and quickly greeted and put in drink orders - iced coffee. The menu had a lot of variety and offered meals from many regions around the world. I chose the Tunisian, which was chorizo and eggs in a tomato based sauce, with two hearty pieces of toast and a cucumber and tomato salad. It was incredibly tasty but not very filling since my Paleo lifestyle doesn't allow me to consume grains. My hubby tried the special - duck confit potato hash topped with poached eggs and hollandaise. It was also very good. We topped off our meals with the berries, but passed on the yogurt. The service was good. The menu is a little limited if you're paleo, but it's not too hard to make it work. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and I was a fan of the music selection, which would fit into the \"coffee house\" genre. Overall, we were very pleased and will be back.",

    "text": "Wild Honey at Scotts Square is a vast improvement on its sister outlet at Mandarin Gallery. For starters, there's a lot more space and a wider variety on its menu, and we can finally make reservations online instead of having to wake up at the crack of dawn on a weekend to queue for a table.Food : The best eggs Benedict I've had in Singapore. We shared the Tunisian, the Scandinavian, the European, the English, the Australian and I Love New York amongst us so that we could all get a taste of the different breakfast sets. The coffees were well made and a couple of us tried this Banoffee drink which was mad yummy! Being a ravenous lot, we also shared a bread basket while waiting for our breakfast sets to arrive. We particularly liked the croissant, evident in the fact we almost came to blows over the sole croissant in the basket. The homemade jams and honey too, were the perfect complement to the bread basket. If we hadn't wanted to save some stomach space for our breakfast sets, we would have ordered one more! The most difficult decision you will face at Wild Honey is deciding which breakfast set to order, but whichever you decide, rest assured they are all equally tasty in their own indigenous way.Ambience : Love the mosaic tiles on the floor and the airy feel of the restaurant. The dark wood works well with the colorful furniture and drapes. Overall, the atmosphere is bustling yet comfortable, and is a great place to people watch on weekends. We like!Service : Can be a bit sketchy if one is sitting outside on the verandah. It is practically impossible to get service after the server takes our initial order, and the wait staff inside the restaurant are too busy to pay us any attention. If you can get their attention however, they are perfectly pleasant.Perfect if they can improve service standards. Prices are a bit steep for brunch but at least the large portions compensate somewhat. Reservations for weekend brunch at prime time absolutely necessary at least a week in advance.",

Love how the dishes are named after different cities / areas - one of my favourites is the 'Belgian', fluffly waffles with grilled mango and blueberries. \u00a0An instant hit for my sweet tooth - beware though, it IS sweet and may not go down well as a main for dinner. \u00a0Perhaps better to share as a desert :)",

    "text": "Sad to say, Wild Honey was an over-hyped and over rated restaurant for me. A couple of old friends suggested dinner there to try out their 'must-try' all day brunches, and it was on the list of 'trendy cafes in Singapore' that we've heard so much about. We weren't allowed to make reservations, and despite arriving super early after rushing down from work, I couldn't get seated to ensure 4 of my other friends had seats either, which was quite disappointing service. So there I was waiting alone outside while the restaurant slowly filled up, to the point where by the time all my friends arrived, we had to be seated at a table for 4, with an additional chair squeezed in. The food was greatly talked about, so we went all out and got a banana toffee milkshake that came served in a colour and shape that was honestly that of doo-doo. It tasted cloying and overly artificial, and the drink slowly congealed into a paste towards the end of the meal - not tasty at all! We ordered several different pancakes from their all day brunch menu that they were famous for, and the top choice was the Norwegian pancakes, that came with smoked salmon on scone like breads. This was average at best, with the accompanying sauce a bit too sour for my taste since it just made the eggs taste sour and the salmon taste bad. 2 stars at most for just having a good ambience in the restaurant.",

The downside is the price (well its in Orchard road, what do you expect), some dishes aren't too fantastic (e.g. Mexican), some of the portions are too small for my liking in relation to the price. Also you can't make a reservation for the mandarin gallery branch, although this is not a problem for the Scott's branch.In conclusion: not perfect but always a reliable place to go for brunch. I'm still waiting for the seats out on the patio!",

The European is their take on eggs Benedict: seriously thick brioche with parma ham and poached eggs. \u00a0The brazilian bread is this cheesy little roll thing, amazing. And the queen bee is a honey grapefruit mocktail. \u00a0Yum.Other highlights of the menu are the Tunisian and the English. \u00a0Enjoy breakfast!",

Due to the limited seats, many find it frustrating to wait. The restaurant did excite me but not the queue. I wouldn't brave myself to Wild Honey until its 2nd outlet at Scott's Square becomes operational; there - I have gotten my most important meal of the day fixed without having to wait, any time of the day. \u00a0 \u00a0Serving an array of breakfast dishes; distinguished by country that ranges from English, European, Belgian, Canadian,Tunisian to Japanese et cetra. While many raved about European - eggs Benedict; I heart English instead.The portion has been massive; it can feed 2 ladies with small appetite. Routinely, I would portion the plate unless I declared a NO dessert and could leave the place without any. What have been so enjoyable in the plate are those juicy pork meat cased in its crispy sausage skin. They are perfectly grilled without drying out and loosing their flavour. The toasted brioche is more provocative - rich in taste with a strong buttery note. Slightly fluffy yet crumbly in some parts. While the briny bacons compliment well with the bread, the scrambled eggs add moist and even-out the saltiness in the former. When waffles becomes unavailable, I will make good with a stack of pancake - Canadian. These thick fermented round flapjacks are doubled in size; 3s are somewhat excessive - sharing is more ideal. I am particularly fond of its texture - very light yet with some volume. They are relatively moist but not dampish. For a savory note, nibble on the bacons along with the cake. Otherwise, top it up either with maple syrup or homemade jam - the morning becomes more angelic.",

I had a delicious, strong serving of French Press coffee- really, it reminded me of Blue Bottle Coffee in SF- strong and luxurious. Also had a serving of the Apple cobbler ala mode. Delish. It's definitely overpriced, but i look forward to checking out their brunch or dinner service when i visit again",

I ordered the Santa fe which is two fried eggs sitting on top of two folded tortillas with some pico de gallo and tiny bits of avocado mixed in.

Ironically, it was served with slices of avocado. (When was the last time you had avocado in Norway?)We also had a raspberry smoothie that was essentially raspberry puree and ice blended together and served in a martini glass.

When we got there, we happily went in and chose our table at the corner of the establishment, but was told by one of the staff that the table was reserved and that we can only sit at the long table in the middle.The seats at the long table was uncomfortable, and the whole place feels gloomy when there's few customers but resembles a fish market when crowded. Although the breakfast was delicious and up to standard, I feel the service could be improved. That said, I will still return to Wild Honey in the near future.",

But due to the smaller set up in the Mandarin Gallery outlet, seating is limited and it is on a first come first serve on-site queue basis, no reservations allowed.But guess what, at the Scotts Square branch, not only is the restaurant bigger, you can actually make reservations! No need to queue and you are guaranteed a table when you arrive! As this outlet is also larger, you wont have the issue of tables being too close to the next so you have more privacy when dining. Not only that, for those who love the Wild Honey Concept so much, you can actually reserve their terrace for private parties!One thing to note though, due to the mall operating hours, this outlet closes slightly earlier than other regular restaurants not within a mall so do go early to maximise your dining experience.Cant wait to go for my breakfast during dinner time again soon! :)",

Somehow the bread is over toasted and was too crunchy. Pretty dry. :(The Wild Mocha Dolce is my poison. This is intensely sweet but packs in some serious caffeine. I always get super high after drinking this. Friends know not to feed me with too much coffee/tea because i'd be bouncing off the walls. I also love the scones at WH. For tea, i like to have their cranberry scone with a cuppa of hot mocha dolce. This has to be one of the better scones in town. I'd put it in the same category as Foster's (another of my favorite). The exterior is crispy and the middle is dense and moist. I'll gently coat it with a thin layer of butter and sprinkle sea salt flakes on it- my very own version of salted butter (because WH doesn't provide salted ones). Yummy! And their fresh compote of berries to go with it. Perfecto.I would be hanging out at the SS branch more often for the following reasons1. Wider desserts selectionAccording to the manager, the kitchen at SS is 3 times bigger than that at MG. Therefore, more space to make pastries! I tried the sour cherry strudel when i was there recently (not fantastic) and they also have more tea cakes and stuff. :) I'll be sure to try more desserts soon.2. More breathing space! I always felt that the MG store was really claustrophobic! In fact, the entire MG feels that way. I feel like i can easily touch the ceiling (ok i exaggerate). Also, because of the small size of the place, i do feel like i can't stay on for too long even though i just wanna chill out with my book sometimes. Scotts is more airy and there's more natural light hence the relaxed ambience. So if you haven't tried WH (quite impossible IMO), do head on down. All day breakfast means that you never have to wake up early! As for me, ADB FTW!",

It is near a hotel so you get many international travellers here having a leisurely breakfast. Fantastic atmosphere and d\u00e9cor. Definitely on the pricey brunch end.",

    "text": "A business cum social meeting was the occassion and Wild Honey was chosen as the venue. I must say from the get-go, its popularity is warranted. Location wise it is the most convenient to get to - minutes away from Orchard MRT station, with bus stops closeby and the Grand Hyatt taxi stand at your disposal next door - it was a breeze getting there.Without the foresight of making a reservation, we were told it would be a half an hour wait at 11.30am on a Sunday, during which we decided to have coffee in the basement below. Their technologically advanced waiting list system was impressive. A few taps on the iPad located at their entrance, I was 7th in line and I received a call on my mobile, informing to choose if I would be there immediately or needed at 10 minute extension. A 'service' I was particularly fond of.Jumpin right in, we were seated outdoors (you can indicate preferences on the iPad), and it being my first time, I took about 5-7 minutes to decide what I wanted whilst we were served water and the orange juice I ordered (Which was fresh, not too sour, good job once again). I decided on the 'Scandinavian', which is grilled salmon fillet on potato rosti, chargrilled asparagus & homemade Hollandaise sauce. It was right on the money, \u00a0approximate $25 bucks if I recall correctly. Salmon was grilled to perfection and the rosti was crispy (I am used to it being less crispy, but it clearly said 'crisp rosti' on the menu so I guess it was done right). Do note it takes about 15-20 minutes to prepare, so if you feel like having this, get your order out right as you are seated.  My friend ordered the 'Norwegian' which consisted avocado, grilled asparagus spears, two perfectly poached eggs wrapped with imported Norwegian smoked salmon, homemade Hollandaise & salmon pearls on a whole-wheat brioche. It looked fantastic, and he isn't too expressive about food but just gave me a thumbs up and a sigh of satisfaction when he was done.Definitely coming back here for more. Service was great, a little too crowded for my liking but then again, Singapore is getting that way and perhaps making reservations in advance would save you unnecessary delays. Another great brunch menu checked off my list!",

Salmon wrapped with asparagus, on top of deep fried thin hash brown (I hope I got it right), drizzled with hollandaise dressing. Sadly, I didn't like it. Not at all. Especially I didn't know what to do with the tomatoes. The deep fried \"nest\" made of hash brown was very tough and oily, I was slightly worry about it flew out of my plate when I cut it with knife. That would be embarrassing. I didn't finish the main, I thus ordered a brownie with vanilla ice cream. Not bad! Good for sharing. Too much for one person.

    "text": "Ah, comfort food, comfort place.Wild honey has been a favorite to-go place for brunch in Singapore. But because they're so famous, make sure you have reservation prior or be prepared to wait. There are 2 outlets around Orchard Road vicinity - one at Mandarin Gallery (first outlet) and they accept no reservation, so you'll have to pray hard there is no queue and the second outlet - at Scotts Square has bigger dining area capacity and accepts reservation. My favorite is always their second outlet at Scotts Square as the sitting area is more spread out and the verandah sitting area has the best natural light for you food \"pornographers\" out there.Their menu has been the same since I visited 2.5 years ago until today. That's pretty unacceptable in Singapore since the dining scene is always fast paced and people always crave for something different from time to time. But it got me thinking, the main reasons that they're maintaining their stellar items in the menu is probably because it still sells like hotcakes? The superstar items like the Tunisian (baked eggs with chorizo in thick tomato sauce) or their perfectly poached eggs benny that we won't get bored eating or the simple-yet-so-delicious French toast that we crave. If one main isn't enough to fill you up (for my case all the time), consider getting \"small plates\" of chorizo, saut\u00e9ed mushroom, bacon and the likes. They have a long list of items under this section for you to mix and match to your liking.Looking at the lack of good caf\u00e9s around Orchard road area, Wild Honey will always be my to go place if I need a good brunch spot knowing that they're always consistent with their quality and portion.",

Waitress hands over our change from the back over my husband's shoulder; not cool. Personally, I wouldn't come back but for those who would like to just chill out and have good milkshakes, this might be a nice spot to soak in all that posh ambience.",

I don't feel there is anything spectacular here. My Corsican was an omelette stuffed with cheese, with some basil and bread on the side. The Carribean waffles were unimpressive, with insufficient mango and banana. I don't think the food here warrants their high prices. Zero innovation, subpar food, high prices. Meh.",

I ended up picking a sandwich with artichoke and cheese. I can't remember what it's called but it was average - 3 stars. The price would put it lower than that though. My friend picked the Portobello Road, again 3 stars. At the end of the day I'm not sure it's quite worth the price!",

    "text": "Definitely on my go to list for weekend brunch. The ambiance here is quite pleasant for weekend gathering and stuff although it is rather noisy (lots of echoes but well it's quite common in dense SG isn't it?). The waiter are welcoming and are not intrusive at all despite the fact the place was crowded, which i really appreciate as I was able to catch up with my friend comfortably without feeling hurried to leave. Onto the main highlight, food. Pricewise, it's rather pricey (bout $30/pax) but portion is quite generous. We ordered the English breakfast and the Boulevard St Michel and it was delicious. I like the fact that jn both of our dishes, they successfully poached the eggs so it has firm whites but runny yolks which I adore. I also liked that they serve our dishes at the same time and are responsive whenever we call them although it was a busy day. Unfortunately, the coffee was a rather let down. We ordered the cold brew coffee but too bad it tasted more like your ordinary cup of joe on ice. I may be a bit of coffee snob but I believe cold brew should be slightly stronger and more aromatic. Nevertheless, my friend, whom is not a coffee drinker, enjoys it. So i guess it depends on your preferences.All in all, i would recommend this place to people who seeks for a good brunch at central location. I would advice you to reserve your seats as it may be hard to get a seat, unless you don't mind sitting at the bar, facing the columns.",
