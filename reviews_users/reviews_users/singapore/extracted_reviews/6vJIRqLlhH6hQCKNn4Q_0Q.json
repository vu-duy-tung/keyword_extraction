    "text": "I love marche pizza so much, but not their nachos. We had margerita pizza, love this one.. And i order nachos for snacking but gosh... The cheese drives me crazy.Other friend ordered pork nuckles, not too bad, it tastes more like smoke duck instead of pork as i dont like pork taste in singapore at all. They also order like bake bacon asparagus... Hmm tasteless as they only depend on bacon to give the asparagus taste.The place itself, Marche movenpick at cityhall, is nice, like a cafe type of resto, pretty cozy to hangouts with friends. I give 3 stars rating as overall for me a resto should have good food aside from good location.",

    "text": "The food is ok, not bad. We had the tenderloin steak and spaghetti bolognese as mains, they were ok. The apple tart dessert is made with thin crispy pizza dough (effectively an apple pizza), served with vanilla movenpick ice cream; it was innovative dessert well executed and very good, but we were told it would take 5-10 minutes to come out and in the end it took 20 minutes. The people are nice, but the service is very slow. Most of the two hours we spent there we were waiting for our order and very frustrated. If you don't have two hours to spare on lunch, go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Mediocre at best. Pizza was decent - although basically a flat bread with toppings on it. Easily made at home by your handy 11 year old. Carbonara was creamy - but more like Alfredo sauce with ham. Finally, for the love of God, pick s cuisine - you can't do Italian, Mexican and German all well. Doing one good is hard enough.",

    "text": "Agree with the previous post. Nachos were awful. The cheese tasted like it was watered down, and was served cold. I requested they heat it up, and they brought it back warm...er. I'd say they brought it up from cold to the level of lukewarm. And the olives and such topping the nachos were too scanty. Wife got a salad and wasn't thrilled with it. Said the chicken tasted funny, and the bread thing served in the salad was horrible. I tried it and I agree. I didn't think bread could get that bad. I thought there was a floor of plain/blandness that it couldn't break through, but theirs broke through it. Would not recommend eating here.",

Movenpick is Swiss, and just like the Swiss you can expect a mix of French, Italian, and German cuisine. Jack of (many) trades, master of none.",

    "text": "This place is godawful. \u00a0We got excited when we saw Marche Movenpick next to our hotel thinking that it would be like the ones in Toronto, Canada and Lausanne, Switzerland. \u00a0Oh boy! were we wrong. We ordered the Margherita pizza and the pasta carbonara and they were both barely eatable. First the pizza - \u00a0it was bland and has no flavors whatsoever, it was a simple crust with few slices of tomatoes and some sort of cheese and I'm not even sure it was mozzarella. \u00a0My girlfriend and I are both low sodium people and we had to add some salt which tells you how bland this pizza was. \u00a0 The pasta carbonara - the pasta was so laden with heavy creme, some sort of mystery cheese and bacon and I don't it's even sure they used pancetta. \u00a0The dish was so salty because of the extra heaping of bacon which was the polar opposite of the the pizza. \u00a0Perhaps they should marry the two dishes together, they may have something there. \u00a0 The service was okay, nothing to write home about...this is not a recommended place.",
