    "text": "Breakfast and Dinner seem like the only meals we get to squeeze into our crazy schedule. Harlow's is definitely a great place in Tempe to get good breakfast. With a very \"homey\" vibe, Harlow's had a huge selection of breakfast and lunch all at very reasonable prices.   The place was fairly packed, but we were seated pretty quickly. The staff greeted us with a smile, and we have to say, they were pretty easy on the eyes. Water was already at the table and drinks were brought out right away. We don't think you can order anything bad here. The standard eggs, sausage, bacon, and pancake breakfast was as good as anywhere else. And the biscuits and gravy were massive with plenty of gravy.   A great local spot to go to the next day after a gig, with plenty of regulars you might have met the night before. A breakfast place that we will be returning to.",

When we go to have breakfast out, we really want a good cup of coffee.  The coffee came and it was very weak.  When we mentioned this to the server she asked if we wanted a cup of the \"double\" coffee.  We said if it was stronger than yes.  It was not much stronger than the weak cup.  Where the coffee was not exactly desirable the food was!  They make their own Chirizo and Salsa.  My husband had the Eggs Maximilian with Chorizo added and was sweating from the heat of the food.  My food was the traditional eggs and bacon.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the bacon, not over or under done.   Well Done Harlows!",

Aside from the food this place has a very local atmosphere which I love and let me tell you that the service rocked and all the great looking female servers are another great plus! Go there on a Saturday or Sunday morning and expect to wait to be seated but it's highly worth it!",

Well the waitress's are still eye candy but I don't expect we will ever return.  The food came very fast..impressively fast but it was all cold. I ordered a Green Chilli Burro and I swear it was Hormell Chilli right out of the can and didn't even resemble anything like a green chilli.  The Biscuts & Gravy were also cold. The biscut was more akin to a dinner roll and the gravy had no taste. What a shame. I hate it when landmark resturants cut corners.",

It's always very busy and you sometimes have to wait 10-15 minutes to get in, but never more than that.  It's a popular place among the ASU students and old-folk regulars.  Nice mix.  Once you're inside you'll discovery they have an only mildly cheesy 50's diner motif.  The staff are super attentive and friendly.  I've never had to wait long for food despite the fact they're always so busy.  Their lunch menu is fairly standard but this place is all about breakfast.  They have a nice array of omelets  (around $8-$9) and egg dishes.  Their chorizo is fantastic along with their homemade salsa, and hash browns.  I can't get enough of the Percy omelet, or the Eggs Maximilian.  If you're in the mood for an affordable and hearty breakfast this place is amazing, just be prepared that it's busy.",

I ordered a glass of water, coffee and eggs Benedict.  First the water tasted like it came directly from the tap, not at all filtered, the Benedict  was mildly warm along with cold \"hash browns\" (these are really chopped potatoes with no seasoning).  My husband ordered iced tea, corned beef hash with hash browns, sourdough bread and a pancake on the side.  His tea tasted like lipton, nothing special and all of his food was barely warm.  The toast was so cold the butter didn't even melt, I could not believe that the waitresses that walked by did not say something.  The pancake tasted like it came out of a box and the corned beef hash was straight from a can.  I do not understand how this place is still in business.  The prices are way to high for the poor quality of food that is served, we paid over $30 and I left feeling like I had food poisoning.  We will never return!!  If anyone is looking for a good HOT breakfast check out Biscuits on Elliott and 48th St on the West end of the Safeway parking lot or The Nosh on Warner and 48th St.",

I did not find this on any website to begin with.  I found this place on accident when i pulled into a parking lot to set my GPS.  I was about to leave and looked up to find the parking lot was full of cars.  This is always a good sign but I couldn't stop and eat right then so i made a note to come back.  Character:  This place has a ton of character and has been updated on the inside for some time but i really enjoy a place like this.  I'm sure it has a ton of locals it's hard to know going ur first time but everyone was very friendly including the waitresses and hostess.  Food: The food was good I had a breakfast burrito smothered with Pork Green Chile.  The boy had a bunny pancake with an egg.  It was good food that came very quick and hot.  I wish i could go back, consistency is a big deal but its back to Vegas tomorrow.  Coffee:  I don't like to see the bottom of my coffee cup when I'm at breakfast and they were quick to refill when it got low and they were always walking around with a pot of coffee.  Thank you Harlow's",

Their menu boasts their heritage of family owners, and the items on the menu are displayed in the style of an old movie poster.  I ordered a 2 egg plate with toast and a juice, it was a simple breakfast because I wasn't very hungry, but they did it well.  The waitress was confusing because she tried to explain that the juice I got was bigger than the one that comes with my meal, and I could order another juice or just pay an upgrade price.  The way she said it made less sense though, and we ordered another juice and then while she was still at our table, changed our minds because we finally understood what she meant.  She seemed to have attitude before that incident, but afterwards she definitely had attitude.  The restaurant was good enough, I think the service could have been better, but all in all it was not bad.",

The best view can be had while sitting at the bar (it's wonderfully positioned right behind the expo line (where they put the food for you non-industry peeps)).

Go to Denny's. When you want to upgrade and not really pay much more... splurge at Harlow's...  The Bad... Parking is a pain and during college season, it's pretty packed. The ambiance is a real dive. I mean it's not much to look at but it is comfortable. Lastly it gets pretty hot there during the summer.   The Good, prices are awesome. I have had the steak and eggs, chorizo, and huevo's rancheros. All are completely great. I've also splurged w/ various pies and all have been good. I try to sneak in here every chance I can and hope to see you there.",

My hubby always orders the eggs and chorizo with a side of refried beans.  He say they make it just right.  I have ordered a variety of items from the menu and I have always liked everything that I ordered.  I really appreciate the fact that they have some options on the menu that are not so large that you can't finish them or feel stuffed.  The place is always crowded on the weekends but I have noticed that if you go earlier in the morning it is less so.  Also, when ASU is not in session it is a little better.  Just be prepared to wait for a table and don't come with a large group of people or small kids.  On the flip side, I appreciate the fact that after you are seated and enjoying your meal, the wait staff always takes your order and brings your food and coffee refills promptly but never makes you feel rushed or gives the impression that they are trying to turn the table quickly.",

    "text": "So my friend ordered the Eggs Benedict and she did not like it at all.. their Hollandaise sauce was very \"lemon-y\" and just not good, so we alerted our waitress and asked for 2 eggs over medium instead.  No problem, we got the two eggs as a replacement and ate our meals.   I had the corned beef hash, which tasted like it was from a can, potatoes which were good, and sausage patties which were excellent.  They easily and happily made my meal sans butter/dairy as requested.  One little bonus was that our server had an ass that was hypnotic... in the words of the great Mr. Pacino, she had a \"GRRRREAT ASS!!\".... but I digress  When our meal was complete we received the bill and noticed we were charged $10 for the Benedict plate.  \"No prob.\", I thought, she just forgot to take it off.  It was New Years day and they were swamped up in there.  So I get to the counter and alert the hostess, she goes and speaks to our waitress and returns telling us that our waitress said we ate half of the meal, which is why we were charged.  WTF?!?  I explained that she was wrong and literally two bites were taken... 1 by the person who ordered the meal and 1 by a friend to confirm how gross the dish was.  She ended up removing the item from the bill, but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, so to speak.  We're not some grungy, poor ASU students trying to scam a free dish, fuck off.",

    "text": "Y E L P !!! My first restaurant comment after lurking the reviews for nearly a  year.  I was up for a late breakfast and really craved something along the lines of a family diner where I could sit at the counter, read my paper, sip my coffee, plan my day and feel comfortable in flip-flops, t-shirt and shorts. My  inbox showed that I had received the Weekly Yelp. A quick search found all of the usual haunts that I ride my bike to in my end of Scottsdale. I had some business in Tempe and narrowed my search to that area. Voila! Harlow's was the first listing.   As a native, I have seen the various incarnations of this local establishment and heard all the raves, yet I never had the time or I wasn't in the area. Not today! I knew that it was almost always busy and figured since it was just me, a little wait wouldn't hurt.  When I arrived, the parking lot was half full. I parked, grabbed my paper and entered into exactly what I expected. Nothing fancy but a very comfortable interior that is inviting. It's roomier than it looks from the outside. Air conditioning was set to cool off anyone coming in from the 105 that had already settled in and was rising. I went to the empty counter and was greeted immediately by one of the many waitresses. She served my coffee and I never opened the menu and asked if I could just tell her what I wanted and she said, \"No problem.\"   The reviews said that the waitresses were cute and young and hot (True), but that is a disservice to how efficient and productive they are. They were all busy, all moving, all social and most importantly made everyone feel welcome. Even first time, old timers like me.  My food was fantastic, large portioned and prepared the way that I requested, but everybody has different likes and dislikes so I won't give any more review on food.   Here's the kick-in-the-nuts part of my visit...  ...after carefully planning where I was going, getting my paper and heading out to breakfast, I kept feeling that I had forgotten something. Hmmmmm, what could it be? Oh, well, off I go.  Still bothering me in the back of my head as I go to pay at the front register. Money clip left at home! Red-faced and kicking rocks, I approach the hostess and explain my plight, feeling like a two-bit bum without two-bits. Got any dishes you need washed?   There was a manager (and I'm assuming owner) at the front as well and without skipping a beat, she takes the ticket from my hand and says, \"That's OK. We're open until 2pm. Just come on back when you get your money.\" She was smiling and pleasant and never asked my name or phone or any details. She never hesitated. It's not like I'm a regular and they know where to find me. I offered to leave my cell phone as collateral, but she would not accept. Embarrassed, I went to my truck, determined to return as quickly as possible with my cash.   Then I remembered that I keep a twenty in the truck for emergencies (like this one). Woo Hoo! I went right back in and thanked her for faith in humanity and vowed to return and tell my friends.   It's rare these days to find that comfortable, small-town trust. We are, after all, the biggest little metropolis in the southwest.  Kudos to Harlow's for great food, quick and friendly service, personality  and a personal touch that went a long way with this customer.",

The food is great, the eggs had a great texture, their made-to-order hash browns were cooked perfectly with just a little crunch and their waffles were light and tasted great with the fresh strawberries and whip cream we got on the side.   When I walk into a place like Harlow's two things cross my mind, (1) old which leads to, (2) dirty bathrooms. I rode my bike so I had to go into the bathroom to wash my hands. I braced myself as I expected the worse, but a pleasant surprise was awaiting me! This bathroom experience was awesome! The room was clean, had mirrors on opposite sides which enlarged the space and beautiful wallpaper and porcine tiles.   Great food, great bathroom, and great service.

    "text": "I've been going to this place for about six years, and to start off i have two theories on this place that I've heard repeated by more than a few people over the years.  1. the waitresses all moonlight as strippers. ha ha, i doubt it, but they are all unbelievably cute and young. they're also all very sweet, if the service was bad (every once in awhile it happens when you've been somewhere so  many times) it seems it was a kitchen issue and the waitress is quick to apologize.   2. this one is so bad... this is the Chompie's vs. Harlow's theory: as you may realize or heard, this is the place for Tempe locals to hit up after a long night of partying, if you frequent Palo, Casey's, Time Out, etc., you will most likely see any and all of the same cats at Harlow's the next day. that being said, I've heard several guys say, if you're none too proud of who you 'went home with,' you take them to Chompie's instead of Harlow's, since you're less likely to see your friends there. i feel like a jerk just repeating it, but it's not my theory!  anyway, they have tons of plates to choose from and they're all named after 50s-70s movie and tv films or actors. there's the cisco kid, the chill will, the gene special, you get the idea. it's none too pretty to look at, but warm and bustling til they close at 2 p.m. you most likely will have to wait at least 5 to 10 minutes for a table.  i find the food to be a little overpriced for what it is, it seems a greasy spoon like this should be $5 average per plate, but it's more like an $8 average plus coffee or juice. everyone swears by the Eggs Maximilian, a giant tortilla laid flat with eggs, chorizo (optional) green chilies, hot sauce, sour cream and potatoes piled on top. it's HUGE. and, to be honest, I'm a connoisseur of Mexican food, I'd like to think, and for a place like this, their refried beans and tortillas are pretty good ( i get the basic eggs and hashbrowns with a side of tortillas and beans and it's soooo good!)  so, that's that on the Harlow's. p.s. not long after hearing that second theory, a gentlemen friend suggested chompie's one morning, i was like dang, oh no he didn't!",

It's your typical old-fashioned greasy spoon coffee shop with burgundy 1970s style naugahyde booths, movie posters and old photos, but heavy on your typical ASU/Tempe crowd.  Harlow's makes you ask yourself the following questions.  Is Burt Reynolds here? How clogged are my arteries getting right now? Why can't more breakfast places have this dated look?  The food and service were pretty good.  Our waitress hopped to it when we said we were in a hurry.   I ordered a breakfast burrito with ham eggs cheese (and a surprisingly spicy salsa) and minced hash browns and gobbled it up before you could say \"Dukes of Hazzard\".   Personally, I prefer my hash browns without all the extras.  I tried a bit of my brunch date's chorizo egg scramble, and it was a respectable effort of something I'm usually very critical of.  If you can, check it out on a weekday, go to the bathroom at home (unless you dig that cramped feeling).  I echo other comments on the priceyness of the entrees.  It's not a place I would go out of my way for, but it's worth a stop if you live nearby or are in Tempe.",

A friend and I shared the Huevos Rancheros (w/green pork chili) & the Seafood Omelet (w/o the Hollandaise sauce - we both didn't care for the texture or taste).  Since we didn't want the Hollandaise sauce, we asked for extra green pork chili for our Seafood Omelet and our waitress happily & promptly brought it.  The potatoes were also really good and we both polished off our plates.  I can see why this place is so popular and would highly recommend.",

    "text": "I don't even know how to start this review. This is a neat diner type place (in a part of the country where it is hard to find a diner) that serves typical, greasy, diner-style foods.    What's the catch?  They claim to be healthier than a diner.   They use AA grade eggs and only margarine and canola oil when they are frying their food.    What's the catch for me? I, for one, would rather have butter.    The 70s decor is inviting, to me, because it reminds me of the diners I spent my teens in. It really helps to create the impression that the food you are getting is wholesome and hearty (ok, maybe not wholesome).  The service also creates this feeling.  The service was good, but not the best.  Not too attentive, but also not shoddy.  Just what perfect diner service should be.  It's definitely popular.  I came here on a Saturday afternoon and got one of the last booths.   I think it's a little bit pricey for what they serve, but the food is good.  However, I'll stand by the fact that a grilled cheese should be grilled in butter.",

I have yet to try anything different here. And because I am such a loyal person, I can pretty much assure you that I will probably never try anything else.   It's pretty much always crowded so be prepared to wait. Not too long though. I think the longest I've ever waited is 15 minutes, which is reasonable. But you'll be served in no time after ordering.   I'm not a huge breakfast person and I currently live at least 20 miles from Harlow's, but will still come here from time to time to enjoy a great breakfast and great service.",

I don't care because Harlow's cuts my hangover directly in half and I feel twice as good when I leave.  If I get me some diarrhea, that's okay.  It's a price I'm willing to pay.  Their food is diner food.  I mean, what you get is going to be a little on the greasy side and you'll taste it in your burps for a few hours.  Some of their food might cause some slight indigestion.  I, however, kind of enjoy heavy ass diner food that settles right to the bottom of my gut.   When you order a water and a coffee, they'll be filled constantly.  I mean constantly.  At most places, you drink maybe altogether two cups of coffee throughout the course of your meal.  At Harlow's, if you really wanted to, you could burn through like ten cups of joe.  I've been to this place with some gnarly hangovers I can't even begin to explain.  One time I went here so hung over that it felt like I coming down off of a crazy psilocybin trip.  Harlow's makes me feel better.  A LOT better.  The ambience is a little douche-y and kind of conservative-Republican and they make the waitresses wear those embarrassingly small shorts and I get diarrhea whenever I go here.... fuck it.  I still like it.",

The biscuits and gravy were pretty good but still for 9 dollars a plate I couldve eaten twice at Dennys.  The people were nice, the service is great, i really love greasy spoons, but i cant hang with the rock gut pancakes at all. After reading other reviews i will prolly go back to try out the huevos rancheros though.",

As for the taste, i found the gravy a little on the bland side, and the biscuits were about the same.  Potatoes were pretty good, kind of a cross between hash browns and home fries.

The Boy order The Maximilian and said it was amazing.  The Portion was HUGE and he ended up taking the rest home.  I opted for the half order of biscuits and gravy which comes with a choice of meat.  We also split a short stack of pancakes (get off my back, we were on vacation) which were fluffy and almost a  1/2 in thick!  Sorry no photos, we were too busy stuffing our faces for me to even think of picking up my camera.

This place has a cozy, cottage, localish feel and you can tell its a popular spot.   I wasn't fond of our table but it wasn't uncomfortable by any means. The server was great with timing whether taking our order, delivering food or grabbing the check. She always topped off our waters (I am one of those customers who downs their waters quickly! Servers beware) and wasn't annoying in the slightest.   The BIGGEST plus I give Harlow's, the portions are perfect when sharing between two people and holy cow, the potato's weren't swimming in grease on my plate! Hallelujah. I love me some potato's and its too bad they are nutritionally worthless and so yummy. We ordered the two egg breakfast which comes with potato's and your choice of a side and we went with rye toast. We also ordered a short stack of blueberry pancakes. It was the perfect amount of food for two and again, the lack of grease was the best thing ever. The pancakes were super soft and they almost melt in your mouth, in the best way.  I would love to come here again!",

Harlow's is a fixture in Down town Tempe and has gained my patronage through their large portions, Great service, and Exceptional breakfast. Try ANYTHING on the \"South of the Border\" section of the menu, and I promise, you CAN'T go wrong.   If you're looking for aesthetics, this isn't the place for you. But if you enjoy eating at local gems, this is THE breakfast destination. Keep on doin what you do best Harlow's. Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.       -Cheers",

Since she is not an early bird and rarely ever wakes up in time for brunch, much less breakfast, I relied on good old yelp to pick a good breakfast place! Thanks yelp!  Harlow's Cafe was awesome! My cousin ordered a simple eggs, toast, and cottage cheese, Jeff got the eggs maximilian with chorizo, and I got the biscuits and sausage gravy with a side of fruit.  Everything was HUUGE.  Coffee and water were always filled. My biscuits were soft and fluffy, and the sausage gravy was delicious! Jeff loved his eggs maximilian, which was gigantic. The eggs, tortilla, hash browns, salsa, chorizo, sour cream mixed together wonderfully. My cousin's eggs, toast, and cottage cheese were fine, very standard.   The vibe was diner-ish with posters of movie stars, cowboys, etc. Thankful I got my cousin to wake up for brunch!",

My wife got a half stack of pancakes, which I only remember being waaayyy overpriced.  The coffee was $2.39 with unlimited refills, which tasted great.  Our waitress was attentive, friendly and hot.

We got a table right away, our food pretty quickly, and service was quick and friendly.  However, the food was not only average to poor, but overpriced.  Basically every food option is $8.99 or more + $4 or more for any side you may want (no, only small parts of sides come with the $8.99-$16.99 breakfast entrees. They have some combos that begin at $10.99+ that have parts of sides in them.   The chorizo eggs my gf got were pretty tasty, but the portion was small. Her potatoes and toast were inedible, something I would throw away if I made it myself even. My biscuits and gravy tasted decent enough at first, the gravy is pretty good. The biscuits are cake like, exactly how another reviewer had described. More like cornbread consistency than biscuits. I couldn't finish them after I didn't have any more gravy to cover them in. The 2 small bacon strips that came with were OK.  We got hot chocolate, which was swiss miss with whip cream on top, a whole 6 oz of it maybe, for $2.75 each.  My gf got a cup of fruit, another $4 for about 8 pieces of fruit.  Total Bill for 2 medium portions of average to inedible breakfast easiest recipes: $31.11 (without tip)  I am a Tempe business owner myself and like to promote eating and buying local, but this place was just another typical low quality medium-high priced Arizona restaurant I have encountered. It probably is more a 3 star than 2 star, but I want to help steer others away if possible, I felt ripped off and unsatisfied, and unless you are hung over and already there, you will too.",

The waitresses all could be in a '50's pin up calendar, curvey and beautiful. It's quite a sight to see the regulars come in and get called by name. They have regular tables and regular girls. And those girls work the flirt for their tips. But how much does one really have to work a 50 year old bachelor? Don't ask me, that was a previous life....

There are a couple of other breakfast places I frequent where I have tried many, many things on the menu and love them, but man their huevos rancheros suck. Here, they are perfection. The green sauce is delicious. The beans are delicious. The tortillas are very good. There are eggs, cooked to order, as implied by the \"huevos.\" The service is VERY fast and you pay up front so you can leave at your leisure so this is my go-to breakfast place when I have something to do afterwards.",

My first time at Harlow's I had chorizo and eggs and it was simply delish! I was charmed by the bustling vibe and mellow lighting and curious art that adorned the walls. The next time I went, I had a Maximilian sandwich--roast beef on grilled rye with cheddar cheese & green cheese with sourdough bread and it was warm and delicious! A pickle was also given. I have liked everything I've ordered from there. I love the waitresses who are really friendly and beautiful as well. Service can be a bit slow sometimes but it's a pretty packed place all the times I've gone to visit so that makes sense. I think the food is worth the wait. I love the homey, cozy atmosphere, though sometimes when there are a lot of people, the buzzing chatter can be a little distracting as you're trying to have a conversation. It makes you feel like you have to talk over people, if you get what I mean. Nonetheless, I love this place and it's the quintessential American breakfast place in my opinion. A highly-recommended breakfast/brunch spot! :)",

My guy and I come here for a quick GOOD breakfast. And quick it is! The waiters we have are nice, and suuuper helpful because I really suck at ordering food, (I don't like talking to strangers) and they're really patient and stuff. Well, I discovered I really enjoy eggs with runny yolk in the middle. And I like their French toast. I've also tried the chorizo, and it's a'ite...taste like my mama's. But I dig it here. Nothing too crazy, it's cheap(ish) and gooood. So, happy stars for this place!",

From the beginning, the service was not lacking in any way.  The pancakes, on the other hand, were a disappointment.  When eating my meal, my immediate thought went to the boxed blueberry muffin mixes that have a pancake recipe on the side of the box.  They were not \"bad\", just not pancakes as I define them.  I might up the rating if ordering something else, but am not inclined to follow up.",

If your cars AC is too cold, you'll get nice and toasty inside, so don't fret about bringing in a sweater. If you cant seem to warm up, just run into the bathroom, the heat from the kitchen stove is piped in at full blast. You'll be hot as hell in no time.    Our waitress, Michelle, I believe, was very nice and attentive. The food was good and the price (other than the coffee) was typical. Its a nice place to hang out for a little while.",

But, I can now say that I will never let this happen again because they have one solid breakfast!   This is an old school breakfast spot. It's a little shack off of University with booths and tables in every nook and cranny. People wait for this breakfast and that says a lot about this little spot. It reminds me of a breakfast diner I visited as a child or one I would have liked to find in college.   The food is delicious. They have homemade everything including tasty homemade muffins (go for the blueberry) and homemade biscuits as well. Their portions are large and in charge. I had the egg white omelet and could only finish half. It also came with breakfast potatoes that hit the spot. The meal wasn't fancy but it was good. When I'm in the area, I will definitely choose Harlow's Cafe as my breakfast spot. I'm just sad it took me this long to find it!",

She slide the menus onto the table and walked away again, squeezing between us. It was extremely rude and awkward. We sat down, and gave our drink order to the asking server. Upon opening our menu we didn't see a lot of meals, more like separate items. It was odd. In addition, the prices seemed outrageous; $9 for two eggs and a couple pieces of bacon!? That's ridiculous! $8 for a couple pieces of French toast!? After seeing the crazy prices, along with the disrespectful hostess, we weren't impressed, we left. Instead we went to Mill Ave right down the street and had an amazing breakfast at the NCOUNTER.",

The coffee was pitifully undrinkable - I even tried adding cream and sugar and still could not take it. My egg whites were raw - runny and gross and the \"home fries\" were cubes of boiled potatoes thrown onto the grill for .4 seconds to give them the appearance of something breakfast-like. The bacon portion was sizable - four big pieces. The only problem was that it tasted like greasy salt - none of the smokey meat flavor you get with good bacon. I would have sent my plate back but the \"NO SUBSTITUTIONS\" written ad nauseum across the menu and the fact that we were seated in front of the kitchen and I saw who was preparing my food made me think better of it.

I like that they have been in the Valley for a long time, family-owned and that they make many items from scratch daily. I like that the food comes fast and hot and that the server, though really slammed on a Sunday morning, still takes the time to chat with you. I like that, when you realize you did a credit card and cash dump (for the race) and you only have a American Express (they take on V and MC) and a $20, that the hostess knows how to handle the situation without making you feel like an idiot.

They also used a rag to clean off their pans to cook on.  I saw stacked up dirty cooking pans and when an order came in they just picked up a dirty pan and cooked the order",

We tried 1) French toast - was okay nothing special  2) biscuits & gravy - this was gross & we looove biscuits & gravy.. 3) Tiffany omelette- was okay interesting mix of shrimp, asparagus & hollandaise sauce 4) chicken fried steak - again very bland nothing special about this & we had bacon eggs and hash browns too and we just felt everything was consistently mediocre nothing really good or great..Oh and we also did the blueberry & peach cream muffins those were okay. Maybe my expectations were too high ? Or we didn't get the right things but we probably won't be returning.",

Then I went into Harlow's for brunch due to yelp recommendations and realized everyone was here. LOL But really, I think everyone is indoors when it's hot out. The food here was phenomenal, I had the eggs benedict. Perfect taste and perfect portion. This is how all eggs benedict should be.

HUGE breakfast plates that include all the standard American classics with some Southwestern faves as well (chrorizo, huevos rancheros, green chile breakfast burritos, etc). Every massive plate comes with a big steak knife on top to help you cut your way through all the goodness.

I brought home the French Toast for my wife and even after re-heating it, she loved it. Most of the food is on the greasy side. And the decor is a mixture of old movies.

Well, two days into our trip and no huevos rancheros in sight, we were trolling the internet for non-chain restaurants in Tempe. Not only was Harlow's independent, but it was amazingly not in a strip mall! Don't get me wrong, they can do some amazing things in strip malls down there, but it never ceases to be what it is. Harlow's is in a low-built shacky building next to a barber shop.   I inhaled those huevos rancheros (with green AND red sauces) like it was my last meal of the day. It certainly was not the last, but (don't tell the family) it was the best.   Also, service was friendly, S's meal was good, the decorations were funky, and even on Christmas eve at the end of the brunch time, we were treated very well.",

It's not too far from ASU and has been around for decades.  Harlows' rises above other morning establishments with fresh typical breakfast dishes as well as great signature meals. Plus, it's not a chain so it has that mom n pop feeling right away as you enter into the restaurant (nothing fancy, but a place that you can sense has down right good eats).  The fresh juice is squeezed daily and their homemade muffins come served to your table piping hot.  We tried a little of all three muffins (blueberry, peach, and strawberry) they had that morning but could only consume little chunks of each because we were so full from our meals.  I had the Eggs Maximillian with chorizo both times I've been here and it still tastes great.  The combination of eggs with chorizo, onions, green chilies, scallions, and salsa on top of bed of home fires is simply overwhelming (In a very good way).  The excitement from the first time had gone away, but the food was still delicious.  I really wanted to get a side of their fresh made biscuits and gravy, but saw the portions and knew that I had to select one dish or the other and not both.  The service is top notch and the food came out quick, hot and very fresh tasting.  The very nice waitresses are never rude, pushy or short tempered. And the prices are very reasonable for what you get; great service, great food at really decent prices.  The only bad thing and it's not really their fault is that the parking is extremely bad (so I heavily suggest carpooling).",

Now if your a regular for more than a week you might gain about 30 pounds and get diabetes.    They give a full meal at a reasonable price for breakfast food.  The waitresses are top notch, good looking, and the services is great. If you go in the morning after a night of partying you will be so happy you did not go to ihop.    After your done eating plan on having about a 3 hour nap afterwards.  When you are eating it kind of feels like you are in a basement of someone's 50's styled house.

Our server Perla P. was cheerful and helpful with not only suggesting good food to our taste (Percy omlette, hash, bacon, potatoes), but also told us of the rich restaurant history. This place is truly local and one of a kind. We were very impressed that they serve ketchup with NO high fructose corn syrup. it may seem like a small thing, but is is our gold standard for restaurants that really care. We learned that many employees have been there for decades and the management is genuine in putting customers and employees first. Goodbye chain and boutique restaurants, and hello Harlows. We will be back!",

    "text": "This place was best summed up by their biscuits. Different than you'd expect, yet still pretty good.  See, when I think old school diner, I expect a crowd of old people and a waitress who has... well, who has been beaten down by life and is still standing out of tenacity and spite. Instead there are young, attractive ladies (a friend called them hangover hotties) serving us, and a mix of young trendy kids and old bikers enjoying the food.   The coffee was typical diner coffee, maybe a little pricy.  Then the food came. Both my wife and I come from breakfast loving families, so we have high standards. The biscuits were at first disappointing, looking like dinner rolls. But they tasted right, and were actually not bad. The chorizo and egg was definitely gringo style, but some cholula fixed that. The omelette wasn't her dad's omelette, but they were dang generous with the bacon. Beans were good, but the potatoes were like a blank canvas, in need of your ketchup, hot sauce, and salt and pepper accents.  Overall the experience was teetering between 3 stars and 4. It was pretty good overall, but the great service gave me that extra push. They live up to the four star rating.",

What a nice, little surprise! As other reviewers mentioned, Harlow's gets crowded and this was especially True after the race. But despite that, they got us seated within 15 minutes. Not too shabby. Service was prompt including the water and coffee for our weary and parched souls.   I had the Cisco, I think it was called, with french toast, two eggs, and sausage links. I have had better french toast elsewhere, but I still really enjoyed my meal. My companions also had meals that looked delicious. Perhaps even more so than mine? Can you say food envy? Anyways, the prices were average and also the ambience. I can see the charm of an unchanged place after many years especially when you have been coming for years. Overall, I thought it was cool. Would I drive from CenPho for the food? No. But I would stop for breakfast if in the area. I am glad I had the chance to try it....",

We went on a Sunday so it was busy, but we only had to wait 10 minutes or so to be seated which was nice.  It is a cute \"dive\" type of restaurant.  Our waitress was attentive and great, she got our drinks and orders fast, refilled, etc...  The food however was very dssapointing.  I got french toast with sausage and eggs.  The eggs were ok, the sausage was ok, but the french toast was sub-par.  The toast was a little soggy and bland.  My mom got pancakes and sausage.  She said the pancakes were alright but kind of flavorless and her sausage was tough.  My daughter went for lunch and got the french dip and onion rings.  She did not like the french dip at all.  The meat was very, very dry and had no seasoning.  Unfortunately, the meat did not taste fresh either and really grossed me out.  She ate her onion rings which I tried and those were actually good.  We also ordered a side of biscuits to try since we were craving them and they were really bad.  They were dry and not soft.  Next to the french dip, these were the worst.  I was sad because when I ate here a few years ago I remember it being very yummy. (I had gone a few times in the past).  I will probably not go back.  I hope their food gets better, service was fine.",

I took a look at what my fellow Yelpers had rated high, and nearby.  Harlow's Cafe came back loud and clear!    My mom had the super sized, ultra delicious Belgian waffle.  It of course came with butter and maple syrup.  As for myself, I went with the regular stack (5) buttermilk pancakes.  These hotcakes were easily 1\" thick if not more!  I always come prepared with a monster appetite, but sadly, I was defeated by the flapjacks in this semi eating challenge.  To sum it all up.  The meals were both giant and delicious, the bill total was under $20, and we left the cafe happy campers.",

It was nice to see \"regulars\" interacting, but we probably won't become one of them. It seemed like everything was just cooked too hot. Here's what we had:  I had the pancake, egg and sausage patty combo. The eggs were supposed to be scrambled, but there was no fluffiness to them. Instead, they were closer to being fried and literally just chopped up with the spatula before plating. One small sausage patty. The pancakes tasted fine but were well cooked on one side (down, of course, as if I couldn't taste it if I couldn't see it??). $9. Ouch.  Hubby got eggs over easy, toast and hashbrowns (plus a shooter of juice--seriously, it's a tiny glass). His toast was cooked perfectly. The eggs were overdone and lacked runny yolks. He didn't complain about the hashbrowns, but even one side of those were darkened. Another $9.  We tried to share a regular order of biscuits and gravy, but it just wasn't that great. For $7 you get three split biscuits (these were decent--definitely buttermilk and the perfect balance between dense and fluffy) smothered with gravy. I think I saw 3 tiny bits of sausage, and the rest just tasted mainly of flour. We left it half uneaten.  All in all, you don't go here for the ambiance, and now I wouldn't go for the food. It's sad that as we passed a McDonald's hubby said, \"I bet their bacon and egg McMuffin would've been better.\"",

    "text": "My friend and I officially started our weekly brunch get-togethers, and the first stop was this cute cafe.  We didn't have to wait as long as I thought we would, so that was nice.  I ended up ordering a half order of biscuits and gravy with sausage links and two eggs.  Yum!  The portions are plenty big, but I ended up clearing my plate.  My friend got the hashed browns with blueberry pancakes, and I loved that when his order came, they added a mini pancake so as not to waste any batter.  How very opposite of wasteful!  He said his food was delicious as well.  The prices are not what you would expect, so no unpleasant surprises.  The waitress was good too and came back plenty of times to fill our coffees and water and ask how we were doing.  A few things to point out:  1. Be sure to look up once you get inside to see what the special is.  It's usually written above the bar area.   2. If you go looking for skillets (like i did), you will not find any here.  Don't be deterred, though.  The menu carries a good variety, and the food is awesome. 3. They do not do separate checks, so be sure to figure out your payment beforehand if you think you're gonna split a check between some friends. 4. A half order of biscuits and gravy is a lot if you have a normal-sized stomach, especially cuz their biscuits are rectangular in shape instead of round, so be forewarned.  Overall, great service, great food, great place.  Bon appetit!",

The vibe in the place was so great that I didn't waste any time trying the food and I'm glad I did! My husband and I had the greatest breakfast we have had in a long time! Our server Katina was very friendly, our food was on the table within 5 mins of ordering it (and the place was not empty)! As I looked around I saw nothing but happy customers and staff! Zulema the manager was also extremely friendly!!! This has got to be the BEST place I have ever been to and I eat out everyday!  Kudos to the owners and staff for the great food, smiles and OUTSTANDING customer service!!!!",

There wasn't much to the burrito, it was all chorizo very filling and cooked perftctly. It's easy to mess up chorizo but this was done just like my mothers.  The eggs benidict was even better. The holandaise was lemony and creamy, really light. Eggs poached perfrctly. So good, I secretly wished I had ordered them myself.  The waitresses were very attentive and friendly. The prices were really favorable as well.",

The French toast was perfect light airy with lots of flavor. Hash browns were perfect home fries thick chunks of potatoes! Bacon was thick and crispy! Seriously I was impressed with the good serving portions they don't skimp out! For my BF and i to eat it cost 25$ I feel like that's a good deal for yummy food!

I had the Huevo Rancheros and my wife had the Waffle Sandwich.  Both surprised us because the Racheros were just eggs, refried beans, hash brown potatoes and one tortillo.  It was all separate on the plate, and didn't look like any of the Huevos I have had anywhere else.  The Waffle Sandwich was the same type presentation, just a waffle on the plate with bacon and I think just one egg, and served with butter and syrup all separate from each other.  I just we were expected to assemble the sandwich ourselves.",

Came here with some friends from out of town before heading to the airport. Ordered 5 plates, 2 coffees and 1 tea. I ordered the Eggs Maximilian, others ordered basic plates (eggs/bacon/pancakes, etc.). Total came out to ~$80. Food seemed OK, my Eggs Maximilian dish was actually pretty good and pretty large, but the others remarked that their plates were the same as anything you could find elsewhere for less money. I'd rather head somewhere in the same price range that offers a bit more than the basics.",

The servers here are always friendly and you can tell that they get a lot of repeat business because nearly everyone around me whenever I've eaten there is a regular that the waitresses know by name.  Everyone there always seems cheerful and the quality of the food is excellent and always consistent every time I've been there.    Today we received a real blessing!  We were enjoying our food when our server (this is the second time I've had this same server, and she is very sweet) came over and let us know that we were all taken care of and presented us with a brown paper bag that had a jar of their house made salsa in it as well!  She let us know that the owner (who had seated us) had taken care of our meal!    I definitely recommend this place if you want good food and service from people who really care about their customers!  I have had the chorizo and eggs twice.  It is delicious, though some may find it too spicy (I love spicy food), and I recommend getting it with tortillas as their tortillas are also delicious.  I love their breakfast potatoes which are always crispy on the outside!  My fiance had the breakfast sandwich, which he thoroughly enjoyed.  We haven't tried anything off of the lunch menu, but I wouldn't expect it to be anything less than spectacular!",

Full of flavor since it had everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Service was fast and friendly...drinks never got below 1/2.  Will definitely be back!!!",

When I found Harlow's a few years ago, I was not disappointed. Now I eat here at least once per week.  My usual is #2 Cisco which is French Toast. They also have a lot of good Mexican breakfasts. Always check the board for special, like Eggs Maximilian with chorizo. Chorizo is home made.Or Chicken-fried steak and eggs.  Portions sizes are HUGE and often it is my only meal I need for the entire day.  The cooks at Harlow's are the ultimate professionals. They manage to prepare food for dozens or hundreds of customers every day.  The wait staff is exceptional. Friendly, welcoming and always on the ball, re-filling your coffee or iced tea.  Enjoyment of life is all about simple things like finding a good breakfast place with tasty food and friendly people. You will find it at Harlow's Cafe.",

Plan going when it isn't 100 degrees outside.  Also, be prepared that they will only split the check between no more than two cards.

    "text": "I had to laugh when I read Lester C's review, short but to the point and shows that sometimes, the best review is concise and I think he captures the main point, definitely a breakfast place worth checking out.  It is, in all senses of the word, an old fashioned diner. The wood paneling of the interior is from another error and not a design you would see from a place that has been remodeled, I would think, in the last 20+ years but that adds to the rustic charm. The menu is a mix of traditional breakfast foods, many from before the time we worried too much about heart disease (includes me, I'm a huge fan of the Tom Mix, which is corned beef hash, eggs, country fried potatoes and toast) and they have some great Southwest based breakfast items.  From the discussion between patrons and waiters I got the sense that the place has A LOT of regulars and the discussions provide a homey feel that I found enjoyable. I actually live fairly close so surprised that I have not come here more often (oh wait, not a big fan of breakfast food, that would explain it). I would probably do breakfast here on a Sunday morning and then maybe head over to Cartel Coffee Lab, just down the street for a more high-end coffee drink and a chance to read the Sunday paper of your choice. I feel bad about doing that in Harlow's because it is one of those places that the waitresses make more money via the turnover so I don't think extended lingering would be appreciated but Cartel can fulfill that part of your Sunday morning experience if a little Sunday paper downtime is part of your preferred weekend experience. :-)",

    "text": "I just got back home from my first visit at Harlow's and I'm legitimately so bummed that I felt the need to write a review just in hopes that management sees this and changes some things so others won't experience what I encountered today.  I am a very generous tipper, I always tip more than what I should. I'm a nice critic, on a scale of Simon to Randy I'm Paula. LOL. I worked as a server/host/supervisor for over 5 years so I know that going into work everyday is not something that you look forward to all the time. I get it, I hated being a server, but it's no excuse for displaying it so obviously to customers.  Right when we entered there were a group of people standing around, and nobody said a word to us for at least a whole minute. When the host finally approached, she sat us down quickly and placed the menus on the table and immediately walked off without waiting for us to sit down or even saying if a server would get to us, what the specials were etc. Well, when I first started hosting I used to do the same thing because people made me nervous so I let it fly. Our server came to our attention in about a minute...\"What can I get you to drink?\" We let her know and she left without saying she'd be back or Okay. 30 seconds later she wanted to know our order. I barely had time to look at the menu but knew what I wanted because I was craving food already so I told her. Food was on the table in literally 3 minutes and she dropped it off without saying a word...which I didn't know whether to take it as maybe it had been lying around or if it because it was slow...but I was starving so I wash't complaining about that at all. The food was fine. Just fine though, nothing super special. It did the trick in clenching our appetites but that was the thing. It wasn't anything special or something where I was like \"Mmm this is good.\" I was halfway through my meal when the server came and dropped the tab on the table. Again, didn't say a word. Were we irritating her or something? No, because we didn't have time to ask for anything...Was she having a bad day? Zero personality. Honestly I just got a to-go box and packed up my food because I didn't even want to be there anymore. The total bill was about $30 for two meals and a drink (he got water) which was not worth it. And being in college, pinching pennies is detrimental and I only ever get to treat myself a couple times because it is what I can afford. The cashier didn't speak either. Didn't ask how things were...just gave change. So needless to say I was upset and broke, and upset because I was broke especially when I did not enjoy myself. When the bill was paid we walked out, didn't even get a goodbye or a thank you. Judging by the high ratings maybe I just got a bad server, but then again I didn't see a manager around either. When the boss is away...?  Like I said I'm not a hard critic because I appreciate different people and different foods...but I won't be back. Not like we'll be missed.",

Be it the Cisco (Eggs, Sausage/ Bacon, and French toast) or Turkey day on Thursdays (fresh carved turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, and cranberry sauce), the food here is great. Come hungry, because the portions are very large.   While the food is great, the waitresses are just as awesome. They are beautiful and super friendly.   My only complaint is that they are only open until 2pm. This place is in walking distance to ASU... people at ASU don't even get up until 2PM. I would imagine if they would just stay open until 3:30 or 4, they would see a whole new customer base.",

But I came here yesterday, after 3 months, and it had completely changed. My Huevos Rancheros literally had a small streak of green chile, my potatoes weren't crispy (instead, they were just boiled and put on the griddle for less than a minute, and they were still scorched with no oil), and the beans tasted old. Not to mention, the plate also down graded in size.   I was sooo embarrassed, because I had brought some people from out of town to enjoy my favorite breakfast place and it was a big disappointment. My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy but it had little to no meat and was very bland!!  The only reason I am giving this restaurant 2 stars is because of the service. My coffee just never seems to run low and I love it. The waitresses are always on top of their game.  I want to know what happened to this place, and if these changes did occur, they need to be fixed. I understand about the portion sizes, but the quality of the food should still be there and I strongly urge them to reconsider their lead cooks if they're putting food out like this.......",

It's nice that it's an oasis of family-owned in Tempe, which is a sea of chains... but still.  Gotta say I enjoyed my breakfast at Essence Bakery & Cafe way more. Yeah, I guess they're entirely different animals, and maybe part of it is really is a matter of preference.  But even though on that basis, I'd like to give one more star, I just can't because of the same deal with the service I've been running into all over this town:  college kids that make no bones about the fact they'd rather be somewhere else.",

I found the service to be excellent, maybe the best I've ever had despite the fact that it always seems to be crowded they get people in and out of the restaurant quickly. The portions were huge and at affordable prices. The food is delicious, huevos rancherous and the cisco plate are both excellent choices.  The feeling of a mom and pop atmosphere comes to mind. The old style booth seating, and canvas paintings on the wall are a nice touch. I've always gotten my food in an extremely quick manner, and at the same time never felt rushed. I would recommend Harlow's cafe to anyone and see myself becoming a frequent customer.",

I ordered the chicken fried steak on the second try and the meat was grey and lacked flavor and the green beans and potatoes had an obviously chemical canned flavor that was nearly inedible. I get the draw of this place though. It's the waitresses with tight shirts serving old white construction workers and good ol boys who ogle the girls who are not that pretty considering this is a college town. I love a good diner and I have been to some great ones and this was sub par I vowed never to return because the place was bad both times I visited and there are some really good cafes very near here that are a better value and have better food. Also the building it is located in is a shoddy trailer park looking place that is sort of vintage but not in that good vintage kind of way like diners I have been to in Flagstaff and out in the California desert. Even a Denny's offers better value and better food than this place.",

Yes, we could go to Matt's, but why wait for over half an hour with nothing to look at but the downtown see-and-be-seen art crowd and straggling suburbanites?  Or, I could go to Le Grande, but my breasts (and diamonds) aren't big enough.  No thanks.  Harlow's amazing (and reliable) food, good friendly service, the hot waitresses, the eclectic mix of patrons, and the four types of hot sauce on each and every table make this place my favorite.  Note: only 4 stars because it IS a little pricey for breakfast food ($9 for eggs Benedict), and because you will run into someone you know, not good if you are all tore up from the night before.",

All she wanted to do is argue that they were indeed hash browns. I don't like home fries whatsoever. Some of the home fries are okay, but not theirs. No onions peppers or anything. Just very dry cut up potatoes. To top it off, my over easy eggs were over hard. The rye toast was cold and hard and unbuttered. Like eating Melba toast. The server came by and asked if everything tasted alright, but before I could answer, she took off. I'm sure she really cared anyway.

I ordered the biscuits and gravy (with sausage links) and it looked like the most unappetizing dish I've seen in recent memory. The biscuits were these tiny square atrocities and the gravy looked so bland with just a couple of micro sausage bits. I know it is biscuits and gravy, not always the most beautiful dish but the taste was pretty bad too. Everything tasted like it came out of a package. Now I realize this is a diner and the food isn't always the best but with the price premium on this stuff it is not worth checking out. The food was over $8 and the coffee was $2.55 My roommate had the chorizo burrito and enjoyed it but said it wasn't anything special.  Also, if you decide to go with a group of friends, bring cash.

My friend and I were trying to find breakfast at noon one day and we happened to be around Harlow's Cafe so I was like, \"why not?\"  This place is a small little place; no fancy signs or anything. So if you were to drive by and determine a place to eat by the signs of restaurants, then you would've missed out. The cafe is surrounded by one sided windows which sucked at first because I didn't even know if they were open or anything. However, since the parking lot was practically all filled up, it should be open.  When the door opens, welcome home. There is such a warm, mama's kitchen feel there.  My friend and I waited for like 5 minutes because they were pretty full. However, we had pretty decent seats. It was nice.  The menu consists of not just breakfast, but lunch and dinner, too! :O just kidding. I was drawn the the breakfast side of the menu because, well, the first meal you should eat is breakfast. :) I am always down for breakfast; any day, any time!  Anyway, I had the huevos rancheros (I wish i can choose sausage patty rather than ham...I know it isn't traditional but I prefer it) and my friend had the egg sandwich. I was pretty surprised with the portion of his sandwich; it was pretty big for a nice price. I wouldn't change my huevos for no sandwich. :D  I am surprised I didn't know this place existed, especially in Tempe. I would be coming here more often; more likely when I go into Tempe.",

The restaurant is the definition of greasy spoon with the pictures of famous people on the paneled walls.  If that is not your thing and you need a $tarbucks atmosphere you should probably pass.  If you get over it then you will have a really great breakfast.  On to why I updated my review.  I ordered the Eggs Maxamillion on my last visit since I am vegetarian now so I couldn't go for my usual standby of Chip Beef. It was one of the best breakfast items I have had since I moved here.  It's hash browns with green chillies ( order them extra crispy ), sitting on a tortilla, topped with a fluffy egg omelet covered in salsa.  It's Huevos Rancheros on crack.  I will be adding this to the breakfast rotation now even though it is a bit of a haul.  Try: - Eggs Maxamillion - Chip beef - Hash Browns ( Extra Crispy )",

Harlow's servers can be snotty or nice - throw of the dice. Harlow's parking lot is a bitch - don't you dare park in the Tack and feed shops spots!

However, after being drug here a half a dozen times or so, I hate to say that I find nothing special about Harlow's. It is always very busy, but not in a busting, upbeat way. More like people running around frazzled and disjointed. The service is average. The waitstaff does their job, but they aren't overly friendly. The food is average to less than average quality. I always order breakfast items, so I can't comment on their lunch menu. However, in my experience at Harlow's, french toast is french toast. A muffin is a muffin. And that's it, really. The atmosphere is kind of dismal to me as well, but I have yet to put my finger on as to why it feels this way.  I want to love this place, I really do, but Harlow's has yet to prove anything special to me. Perhaps I'll be back, but if I'm honest it would take quite a big change for me to catch onto the hype.",

The one Negative is the server, didn't know her name, she was a tall blonde girl with glasses early 20's. she wasn't very friendly, didn't even look at us when we were ordering, wasn't very welcoming. Then at the end of the day while talking to the table next to us she stretches out her arm and slaps are bill on the corner of our table without ever comming to our table, just extending her arm. From the next table and slapping the bill on our table, no \"when your ready\" or \"thanks for comming \" no contact at all, I understand it's busy, but cmon.

The service is fantastic, food is very tasty (even though my over easy eggs were cooked through) however the coffee is burnt and everything is way over priced. For lower cost you can get better quality ingredients at The Normal Diner or US Egg. For example real cream for coffee and real butter for toast. Paper products instead of styrofoam. $10 for two eggs and potatoes, $3 for what taste like old burnt coffee... It's a bit much to swallow. I'll come back if prices lower or quality improves.  Update: we came back again. Potatoes were cold and over all food was unimpressive. Will not be back.",

I've never found the coffee to be anything spectacular, but it is kept hot and full, which is nice.  The staff are consistently friendly and service is good. Although it slows down a little as the place fills up, there are usually plenty of servers available to handle the crowd and they turn over tables pretty fast at breakfast time. During lunch, it seems that people tend to linger a bit longer, so the wait is likely to reflect that. There's no inside waiting area, so you either get seated quickly, awkwardly hang out by the register or go outside. I think I've always gotten a seat pretty fast.  It is good, simple food that is made well and served up pretty fast, too.",

A little added to over time, but don't let the looks fool you. The food is great!   I was wanting something light. As I browsed the menu I could easily see none of these were small plates. Disappointment was quickly becoming reality. The nice, energetic waitress came to the rescue. She showed me the \"sides\" menu. Woo hoo! I found what I needed. GRITS. I like grits. I had recalled reading \"like your grandma used to make\". Well my dad's mom made him grits and despite the carbs I wanted grits too. I expected them to be ok and I would be fine with that. I don't buy them for home because Brad does not like them and there is no point in making 1 serving! I ordered that with 2 eggs. Brad ordered chorizo and eggs  breakfast with a pancake. The chorizo was spicy and the potatoes were cooked crispy. Brad shared some with me so I could taste. My grits on the other hand were WAY better. Just needed some pepper because I like to add pepper to my grits. My eggs were sunny side up and tasted great as well. The pancake we decided was a little dry, but still ok.

    "text": "My daughter was passing through on the way to the airport, and asked if we would like to have brunch with her.  Let me see, watch the NFC Championship game or have lunch with one of my Beloved daughters? Hmm...NOT!  I am not a person that is often satiated by spectating sporting events. I always want to be outside doing things, instead of feeling that life is passing me by as I am awashed and entertained for hours by television programs.   It was a no-brainer, and the only question that was left to be answered was the question as to where?  I chose Harlow's for nostalgic purposes. There was a time during the dotcom boom, that I was part of a Tempe startup that eventually exploded, then got bought out. And Harlow's and many other downtown Tempe restaurants were our regular haunts. We had catered breakfast   meetings, and many of our team lunches were spent at Harlow's.   I had brought my daughters here on occasion; but they were so small back then that they didn't even remember that they had been here during those times.  Not much has changed with this restaurant. It's still in a small strip mall with ample parking on a slow day. High-rises have been erected nearby, but the building has been improved upon after all these years.  Inside, the wood paneling reminds me of the 1940's  - 1950's era when this was considered high-end and high class. Now, it's politely referred to as \"nostalgic.\" However, the workers here also carry with them the same kind of old-fashioned courteous and efficient \"nostalgic\" service that most people expect from small diners of this sort.  There is a significant amount of options to satisfy every palate. I had the steak and eggs, my wife had the Cheeseburger, and my daughter had the grilled cheese sandwich.   Their food is none too spectacular for this Tempe Icon, but is more than acceptable in its basic taste and portion size. The walls are littered with Cinema posters from a bygone era, and still provide great conversation pieces.  All in all, even though this hasn't changed in all this time. I was glad that the best parts of this establishment still remained True to this day.",

It's your typical cafe with the main seating area, breakfast bar, and cooks in the kitchen right in front of you. I read that it can be a wait due to how popular they are so I got there at 7:05 (they open at 7) and there were already about 6 cars there! The coffee and food were fantastic. My waitress was awesome and greeted me right away. It's definitely a homey feel and so many of the customers are known by name!",

Understand please that I eat breakfast out at least twice a week, and I travel as well so I have eaten breakfast in many places. Bar none Harlow's is right up there with the absolute overall best. Pleasant and efficient staff, add to the dining experience. I think John (the owner) secret is the quality of the ingredients, the bacon is fresh, meaty, and flavorful, the eggs are bright yellow, the sourdough toast is ultra fresh, and the potatoes are fresh and cooked to perfection. The portion size coupled with the quality and the great atmosphere make this place high on my list. My compliments to John and the staff for maintaining such a high level of quality and great customer service for all these years.",

The young pretty waitresses girls (no guys), flirting with characters you would find in strip clubs. Even the restaurant logo, shows a sexy clad woman from the 50s.

The staff is polite and friendly, the service quick and attentive, the decor and the menu are old Hollywood themed (Harlow's = Jean Harlow, get it?) and did I mention the food is fantastic??? I don't drink coffee but my friend says they serve the best shitty coffee ever. Coffee drinkers I assume will know what this means. Thought it necessary to mention.

Both are served super fast, taste great with their never burnt coffee, and is not way too much food--the perfect amount after a long Friday night (they even sell Gatorade for after those really, really long nights).  Parking is right out front and along the side of the building (non-covered) up against a Circle K on the corner of Hardy and University. Although the place is usually packed on weekend mornings, finding a spot isn't too tough.  The building itself reminds of what I would imagine Tempe was like before all of the modern infrastructure was built (i.e. huge ASU apartment buildings, stadium, probably anything built past early 90's) which is pretty cool. I feel cozy here when I eat which is not really a feeling I get at other places like nCounter (which is still an excellent place in its own regard).",

The walls are wood-paneled and like everything else in Harlow's inspires thoughts of how the place could be updated for the modern age and keep the same cozy feeling.   I suppose that should be the theme of this review--updating your restaurant.   The food here tastes great, but it is very typical breakfast fare. Fried in vats of butter and oil without concern for the carbohydrate levels of you or your unborn child. Doesn't get much better for a fierce hangover, which will be promptly cured from the coma you'll slip in to after any of the specialty plates.   One of drawbacks of this anachronistic beacon of breakfasts are the prices. Apparently adjusting for inflation was lost on the menu creator--a SIDE of hash browns costs four dollars, while two eggs and some hash browns will cost you ten bucks, but you get a drink with that. Don't forget 3 bucks for a cup of coffee.   Like other users have mentioned, parking can be a pain when it's busy. They close at 2 PM, so here's a hint: go at 1 PM.   If this review were based solely on the service it would be 4 stars, the staff was very friendly despite the fact that they only seem to hire women. The guy who cooks your food is a jolly looking rotund chef who knows how to fry an egg.   Not sure if I'll go here again unless someone I know requests a biscuit that will survive a nuclear holocaust.",

So you have chosen not to support the system by going to a private business instead of a factory processed franchise - Harlow's is kinda nice. The interior is beyond eclectic, as are the patrons. No focus in style, more focus on functionality.   Our server was nice, and fast. The order was good, portions was to par and it tasted nice. Service and quality food, that usually gets a good review in my book. I like that it is a family business, and that it really feels like a hardworking place. It feels like they take pride in providing you with good service and a good meal. Mission ackomplished.  However, I cannot give this place more than 3 stars because I judge the whole experience - and I didnt like that it looks like a rotary club from the 70ies inside (its not dirty or anything, just dated). And I didnt like that I was so sceptical coming in as a new customer due to the univiting exterior. Even though, now I am glad I did. I might even come back.. but that would be for the awesome omelette.   ..und das ist nach der kritiker",

Our server asked what we would like to drink, and we looked over the menu to find the drink list. It's not printed on the menu!!! (Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I looked 3 times.) We ended up just getting water.   Our food comes out decently fast. No complaints there. However the server forgot my husband's bacon. That's ok, I accidentally ordered a plate with three different kinds of pig. I'm expecting some awesome food, but their food is SO BLAND. The \"hash brown potatoes\" are not hash browns by any means. They are half-way mashed potatoes with absolutely no seasoning on them and are the least bit browned. Very disappointed. The sausage is hormel, and they say as much on their menu. I think some of the other meat is too. I could go to ihop and get the same meat. The home made biscuit was good though. Although that's not enough to make up the rest and make me want to come back.   My husband got the biscuits and gravy and it had a bit more flavor, although he was surprised by the bacon taste in the gravy, since they said it was sausage-based.   As I eating my biscuit in my right hand, with my napkin to my left, our server comes by and picks up my napkin, puts it on my plate, and starts stacking our dishes and starts wishing us goodbye!!! Ummm... I'm still eating and I needed that napkin!! Also we hadn't even gotten our check yet! Pay attention, lady!!   Overall we were very disappointed and probably won't be coming back. The bill was too high for some seriously bland and unoriginal food. And I LOVE breakfast food!!",

Harlows has been around for a long time and it shows in their decor, which always reminds me of my grandmas house :) I would recommend the traditional breakfast (eggs, potatoes, bacon or sausage and toast). Don't pass up on this wonderful gem.",

This is a family owned business and the owners were very friendly and helpful - offering suggestions for what to do for the day and even gave us free homemade muffins for our hotel room.  The only reason for 4 versus 5 stars is the lack of ambiance/visual appeal.  Some would pass this gem by and miss out on awesome food and attention.",

    "text": "The reality is that Harlow's doesn't need another review.  It definitely has a strong following, and I think it's mostly justified.  My wife and I went to Halow's on a Wednesday morning.  There was no one there, and there was no wait for a table.  My wife ordered the Green Chile Beef Burrito, and I had the Huevos Rancheros with Green Chile Beef.  We ordered these dishes because so many of the reviews seemed to rave about the g.c. beef.  Though I am not a fan of this expression, the most apt description of my opinion to the beef is, \"Meh.\"  First of all, it has way too much cumin in it.  I have never been a big fan of cumin.  To me, it always seems like the spice people over-use when they are trying to make something taste authentically mexican.  This is ironic, since most authentic Mexican food doesn't use very much cumin.    The rest of my breakfast was pretty good.  The hash browns there are awesome.  We both had a similar opinion.  It was good overall, and by no means a total disappointment.  We'd definitely recommend it, but not if you have to wait in the huge line on Saturday or Sunday.",

    "text": "Before my trip from Lodi, CA to the Phoenix area, I thought to myself of Foods that I could not find in California that are found here... I came up with Creamed Chipped Beef... maybe it was something of a nostalgic moment... something I haven't had since my Army days WAY back when. Days when the Draft was last used.  As my friend and I drove up to Harlow's limited-space parking lot, we conveniently found the last parking space on the South side of the restaurant. And when we walked in the restaurant was 100% full... but we got the last table available... What luck! Everyone that came in after us, and there were quite a few, had to wait...  On the menu...  Chipped Beef on Toast (**** $9.50) 2/3rds of the Oval Plate consisted of the Chipped Beef mixed with White Gravy concoction. The rest of the plate consisted of a side of Potatoes (**** 1/2), which was Excellent.  Value is not very good on this Entree... as you travel further East in the United States... Chipped Beef will get less expensive.... prices are $4.00 to $6.00 in the East and Southern part of the US.  The dish has the ubiquitous description in the Armed Services of SOS... \"S--- on a Shingle\".  Belgian Waffles (** 1/2 $6.50) A six-inch Waffle, with a dab of Butter off to the side, with a small plastic container of Maple Syrup. Cold, when I did get it, though. Reminded me of an Eggo... that hadn't been toasted enough. I've never had an Eggo... but it reminded me of one. That's the price, I guess, of popularity - too many orders at one time in the kitchen...  Ice Tea (*** 1/2 ???) Unlimited Refills... but in a smaller-than-average glass... and then you'd have to wait for the waitress for the refill...  Value (**) When I was here this past weekend, most of the customers were ASU Students and a \"regular\" elderly population. I really do not understand this restaurant's popularity. Average in Quality Food at best, and prices that are $1.00 to $4.00 MORE than you would pay at another basic Breakfast joint. Also... you have to deal with the less-than-average Elbow Room space.  If I think Harlow's is over-priced, how can ASU students afford this place?  Harlow's makes an attempt at a nostalgic recreation of a diner during the depression-era (not the current depression, but 1936) with photographs of it's namesake Jean Harlow, WC Fields, Mae West, et al. Take me back all the way... 5cent Coffee, and meals for a Quarter... now, that's nostalgia! The atmosphere seems more like a Dive than anything nostalgic.  Waitress was personable and conversant, but review is just based on the FOOD!",

No one was overly excited about the food it was just okay. I had a Spanish omelette and honestly didn't realize it would be drowned in the red sauce. I would've preferred it on the side. The potatoes that came with my meal were burnt. When it came to paying the bill we were disappointed that we couldn't split it in two, but dealt with it. Probably wouldn't go back with a large group again as they are not very accommodating. Not everyone carries cash!",

    "text": "This was probably some of the best Chorizo I've ever had.  It taste so homemade.  The reason for the 3 stars instead of the 5 is because I initially wanted to order a basic breakfast of fried eggs, thick cut bacon, hash brown and a homemade banana nut muffin. I was dining alone, while sitting at the counter top I noticed that the bacon was already cooked, when someone orders they'll just put the cooked slices of bacon on the grill and heat them up.  I didn't want my bacon that way so I read a few Yelp reviews before deciding to change my order.  I went with the Chorizo and eggs with hash brown potatoes and a blueberry muffin instead.  As mentioned, the Chorizo was some of the best I've ever had.  There was VERY little egg in the Chorizo scramble, very little.  The hash brown potatoes were tasteless, absolutely no salt and pepper but paired well with the Chorizo because of the lack of flavor. The muffins you can skip on. They come out hot with warm butter.  You'll need it because the muffins didn't have much flavor either.  I also noticed for everyone to be ordering breakfast, no one ordered coffee.  I didn't see anyone at all order coffee with their breakfast.  That was odd to me.  I'm not totally sure I'd return for breakfast.",

Prices seemed kinda high for the old school diner but hey it's Tempe and not a chain ..   I ordered the cheese omelet with bacon, mushroom, green chilis and cheddar.. omelet was good, but all the green chilis were in one area and the cheese was a slice of cheese melted on top.. weird ..   The potatoes were brown on top but not cooked through and there was no salt on them.. a potatoes best friend is salt.. two bites and I left that alone  The biscuits were 2\"x2\" tall squares .. they were very dense not light and flaky.. I needed a water refill just to get through one of those .. flavor was blah so you definitely need butter & jelly for flavor ..  Now I can cross them off the bookmark list .. probably won't be back",

I told my husband if the festival didn't work out that we should come back to eat here. It didn't work out since we couldn't find any parking, so we went back to the Harlow's Cafe and I was glad that we did. Our whole experience was so very positive from the minute we walked into the door to the minute that we left. We were greeted right away and waited a few minutes for them to clear a booth for us. The hostess who sat us told about their drink of the day, a delicious (but potent) pancake blueberry cocktail. Within minutes of being sat, our waitress, Michela, came to take our drink orders. I got the pancake blueberry cocktail and hubby got a mimosa. My drink was soooo good! Blueberry vodka, caramel schnapps and some other things I can't remember, but it was so tasty. I had to be careful not to drink too much of it before we got food because it was that potent. I got the 2 eggs that came with hash brown potatoes and biscuits. Hubby for the Porgugees burrito (I'm sure I'm spelling that wrong) that came with hash browns also. Michela brought the biscuits to the table very warm from the oven that the butter melted into it. There were 2 biscuits so I shared one with my husband. Our food came in a timely manner and was very tasty and plentiful. Filled a big plate full of potatoes plus eggs for me, burrito for my husband. Very attentive service. Michela was great! Definitely we will be back again and again and again. A great find!",

The service was very good and I wanted for nothing. Coffee was filled all the time and they checked back on me frequently.  My only gripe was the menu pricing. It isn't like they are located in the Scottsdale Quarter or Kierland Commons. I expect higher prices in those locations   Anyway, my food was delicious and it is a must try for breakfast. So, if you are out in the Tempe neck of the woods, give it a roll. Apparently, it is a long standing favorite of locals for over 35 years!

We had breakfast my husband had an omelette with some kind of hamburger gravy however it was not anything like a hamburger gravy as you can see below. I had biscuits and gravy with two eggs on the side the eggs were cooked a perfect over medum. Soft yolk cooked whites. The sausage gravy did not resemble any sausage gravy I've ever made or had it a restaurant. Don't think we will come back. Update when my husband went up to pay the bill they removed the charge for my biscuits and gravy.",

I do not recommend struggling with the parking to try this expensive, yucky food. Service was good, but this place does not deserve the 4 stars it has....",

After the fourth table seated after us received their food, we decided to leave. We notified the magenta haired hostess of the scenario and that we were leaving to which her only response was to stare blankly back at the kitchen. Our food was sitting in the window.

Alot of people really don't know any better and stay in their routine. Two belgian waffles were ordered and neither of us could make it through more than a few bites of this overdense waffle with no flavor. These waffles are in no way comparable to Matt's - they are doing something very wrong here.    Moving onto the biscuits, well I'm not sure what recipe they use for biscuits, but they in no way resemble any kind of real Southern flaky quality. Two biscuits cost about 4 bucks, but they taste like biscuit cake. Refills of coffee were excellent and there was no line at 9am midweek which was a plus. Don't believe the hype here - go to Matt's.",

We came in right before 2 pm, but they said they can still take an order.   Service was very fast and waitress was attentive. The menu is has a lot of choices but the prices are steep for breakfast, mostly $8 and up.   First of all, the coffee was really below standard for a breakfast place. Even iHop has better stuff then this. The food wasn't much better. The hash browns were pretty dry and had a crushed up potatoes texture, nothing crispy in there. The french toast was no better then having your 8 year old make it at home. Everything seemed to need a lot of salt cause it lacked flavor. The bill was $35 for two, with a tip. And no one said  thanks when we left either. Too bad, had high hopes. Back to the Waffle House  for us.",

Its not in my normal 3 square mile radius so it took me forreeevver to finally come here after it being recommended by a good friend a ways back.   I'm glad I finally made the trek. The place is fun, quirky and has this old 'grandmas' diner vibe with the spin of interesting by hanging collectible movie memorabilia and pictures on the walls. Nothing like drinking coffee out of those old porcelin shaply mugs that remind you of grandmas place.   The staff was supa friendly and nice, and I have nothing bad to say about their tight shirts and yoga pants as the waitress staple.   The food menu is carb driven.. At breakfast places I get omelettes because I eat pretty clean. The sides offered with my omelette were Toast, a muffin, or bagel and they wouldn't let me sub for fruit. So i waived my right and spent too much money on not nerely enough food. Furthermore, i didn't touch the potatoes on my plate... So I essentially pad $17 for 3 eggs, salsa and coffee. Wamp! #notimpressed  However, if you love a good comfort food breakfast... this is your place!",

Be open for an experience that is old school cafe style with combos that include either coffee or in some cases juices to go along with a full blown breakfast. The only thing I didnt love was the sausage patties because they seemed a little too artificial for such a quality joint. Other than that the french toast, pancakes, eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and everything else Ive had there was atleast good if not great. Overall if you arent too picky and want a solid breakfast at a great price hit this place up and I promise you will be happy you arrived.",

So I'd never heard of this place really before driving by it the other day.  I meant to Yelp it but forgot and I'm almost glad that I didn't this time.  Pretty much my experience was Bonnie's experience. Well, less tattoos and more jocks, but that's about it.  I really liked the potato's at first, but was really struck that they felt \"dry\" without the onion and/or peppers.  Ya gotta at LEAST have some onion.    That said - I'll totally come here again.  When the girlfriend is craving IHOP and I'm craving anything but - we'll come here.  While their lunches looked pretty decent, it's definitely a breakfast place to me based on what I saw coming out of the kitchen.  The waitresses were super nice (Yea, and generally pretty hot.) and totally flirted with the kitchen guys.  And those kitchen guys were totally en fuego!  That food was coming out so fast!  I sat at the counter, old school style, and got  the full show.  The whole place has that comfortable \"I think I came here as a kid\" feeling even though I've never been here before.  I can tell that everyone else looked just as comfortable.  Yea, it was $8 for my breakfast/lunch, $10 w/ tip, so I won't make it a regular thing, but I'd end up paying that much when she wants IHOP, and the atmosphere and the view (not just the waitresses) is SO much better here it's a bit easier to justify.  Personal tip - Girls you have to check out the bathroom.  Tiny yes, but that wallpaper is freaking amazing!  Totally reminds me of my aunt's old wallpaper sample books from the 70's.  SO cool!",

For some reason, when I first moved here, there was music pumping out of a PA system outside or near the restaurant late at night, but I never saw anyone coming in or out. The weird Laurel & Hardy silhouettes and reflective glass windows convinced me the place served some sinister purpose.  Outside of the fact that its not open for dinner, the place is pretty much the opposite of sinister. I went in with a friend the other day to face the ghoulish population inside but instead found a mix of middle-aged locals and college kids, and good Mexican breakfast food with a nice amount of spice. The portions were huge, the booths comfy, and the menu full of choices.  Maybe the place was filled with vampires waiting for nightfall like in \"Dusk till Dawn,\" after all the decor has likely not changed in decades (it even features tons of photos of past guests standing in front of the restaurant's sign when it had a different name and the street its on looks totally different) but it's probably better it's not.",

    "text": "So I keep reading reviews where people say \"I want to like whatever place, but I just can't.\"  This is how I feel about Harlow's.  The inside is cool... I like the retro diner feel.  And it's right around the corner from me, so it would be a great convenient spot.  And the prices are decent, except for the fact that the food is just not good.  (In the end I feel like I just wasted $30 on a crappy meal.)  I've given the place two tries, and I just don't get how the rating is so high and why it's always busy.  The first time I had the eggs benedict.  Not great, but not terrible.  I would never go back for more of that though.  I had read that the eggs Maximilian are the gem on the menu, so when I gave the place another go, I tried it.  Also not good.  My first bite was cold.  Not room temperature cold, but like refrigerator cold.  The flavor is somehow bold and bland at the same time.  I ate about 1/4 of the plate and couldn't do it anymore.  I left the place unsatisfied and kinda hungry.  My boyfriend likes pretty much everything and is NOT a picky eater, but he didn't like his chorizo breakfast burrito.  I don't know how you can mess  up a breakfast burrito, in AZ nonetheless, to the point that the guy won't eat it, but... well, it happened.  The OJ tastes like the stuff you get out of a machine at a hotel breakfast.    You know you've made a mistake when you know you would have eaten better tasting food at Denny's.  :(  I can't decide between one star or two.  I will never go back there because the food is so bad.  But the service is fine.",

Trust me! They come out a little crispy crunchy that way, otherwise they're much softer.",

Its a super authentic old school breakfast greasy spoon diner; the Huevos Rancheros are a-may-zing, their toast is awesome, their hash brows are the bomb. They have old photos everywhere and they have waitresses that are very helpful (they dont have male wait staff as far as I can tell, but the girls arent dressed like Hooters - Id say its part of the old time ambience theyre going for). The decor is just really homey and like something you'd see in a movie if you picture breakfast diner. Its not trying to be hip and the food is solid, good and you get a great experience eating there. Its only open for breakfast, but its a good place to grab morning chow if youre in Tempe and there's not a huge line out front and a 2 hour wait like some other breakfast places in Phoenix and the food is easily much better.",

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. The eggs were cooked well, but the chorizo tasted off. The hash browns were unseasoned and seemed as though they hailed from a bag of frozen mashed potatoes. The orange juice, which had been promised to be excellent, was nothing more than a hybrid between Tang and Sunny D. Needless to say, I was less than impressed.  Aside from the food (which is the main component at any eatery), the service was quick and friendly and the ambiance, inviting. If you're heading to Harlow's for coffee, toast and somewhere to read the paper or do homework, it's perfect.",

The place was busy, we almost left because there were no parking spaces left... luckily we made one more pass and someone was just walking to his car to leave. There was a little bit of a wait, but not bad. So the inside of this place is really cute, with the wood paneling and all. We got a cute little booth. We both ordered coffee, which was very meh. Really watered down coffee and cost 2.25 a cup. For breakfast, I ordered the spanish omelet and the BF got biscuits and gravy. The omelet was really good. It had a kind of spicy sauce on it that was tasty and I added cheddar which really went well with the sauce. The potatoes that it came with were nothing special, no real flavor. It also came with toast which was what it was. That cost 9$. The BF liked his B&G but thought it was a bit salty. It cost around 8$ with bacon. Overall, I'd say the place was good, but not great. For the 27$ I spent after tip, I could have gone to Liberty Market which is much much better, so I probably wouldn't come back here.",

The menu is large, and there are items on the menu that are great, and some not so great.   For example (great):  Read the other Yelp reviews, people seem to concur that the Huevos Rancheros is where it's at.  I personally like their traditional 2 egg breakfast.  There is Cholula on the table, and the food is done right.  For Example (not great):  If you are there for lunch, and a BLT sounds good, order ANYTHING else.  The BLT is a skinny little slice of a sandwich on wonderbread.  Nothing cool.  (Go to Wildflower Bread Company if you want a BLT done right).  Why this place is special:  In the early days it was called May West, and a despute over the name resulted in the renaming to Harlow's.  In both cases the diner is \"Early Hollywood\" themed-- Starlettes and old movie posters line the walls.    The dining experience is down-home, and small-town-ish, which is something Tempe used to have a whole lot more of-- charm.  So, this place is special because it is charming, relaxing, and full of good old fashioned comfort food in the old Tempe tradition.",

I came here after class and my first impression was that it was a quaint little diner with the wood panels on the walls, diner booth, and several smaller booths. I'm not sure if it gets super busy but I came here an hour before their closing time which is 2pm so the service was really quick. I ordered the Maximilian with Chorizo, the first thing you notice is the amount of food that they give you. I looked at my plate and already knew that I wasn't going to finish it all. Taste wise, the Maximilian wasn't as impressive as I thought it would be, it's basically a chorizo scramble with potatoes, green chiles, and other little chopped bits like onions. A big scrambled egg on top with salsa covering it and a dollop of sour cream. The Maximilian had a nice kick to it, probably from the combination of chorizo and green chile. But I mean it wasn't bad, just not what I expected. I think the next time I go I'll make sure to try something else.   But overall, if you want good, diner-style food that's pretty inexpensive, check out Harlow's Cafe. But make sure you come early since the hours are from 7am-2pm.",

    "text": "Never a disappointing experience here! I've been frequenting this local joint, primarily for breakfast, the entire 3 years I've lived here in the Tempe / Phoenix area. I love introducing friends to Harlow's as well because inevitably they become hooked too.  There are a couple downsides to this place, if you even wanna call them that: 1) limited parking can make it very frustrating to find a spot and 2) the prices are a little bit higher than what you'll pay at places like Denny's, Ihop or 5 and Diner. But those places suck anyway, so it's totally worth paying a little more for better food and better ambiance.  Some favorites are the blueberry pancakes and the biscuits and gravy. The thick cut bacon is delicious too!  Went here today for breakfast and I just might have to go again tomorrow!",

    "text": "I was spending the weekend in Tempe, dog-sitting for a friend and on my last morning, I discovered Harlow's Cafe. I'm glad I did and it reminds me of all the great old \"greasy spoon\" diners back on the east coast.   Looking at Yelp!, Harlow's is one of the only places to get breakfast in Tempe on a Sunday morning, it seems. This was obvious when I pulled up to a full parking lot and people waiting outside.  I was greeted quickly and told it would only be about five minutes.  Sure enough, two minutes later a single spot opened up at the counter and I was shown the way.  My server, Katrina was friendly and attentive.  For as busy as it was, she did not seem rushed or impatient.  I tweeted during my meal how attractive many of the servers were.  I'm sure that partially explains the plethora of college guys in there having breakfast.  It may seem chauvinistic to point such a thing out, but even if they were good-looking guys I would be inclined to mention it just because many times at old diners you get \"Flo\" for your server - not the case here.    The coffee was very good diner coffee - not too bitter or strong but it had flavor.  I'm very particular about my coffee (and everything, really) and was happy.  I ordered the chorizo burro with hash browns and it came out within 8-10 minutes.  When I ordered, I originally asked for well-done hash browns but after seeing a few orders in the window that were nice and crisp, I changed to just regular.  That was my only mistake as my potatoes came out white.  Katrina saved the moment by asking the cook to give her a small side of fresh, crispy hash browns.  He obliged and they came out perfect.  My \"homemade\" chorizo definitely had a kick and tasted authentic and the eggs were a perfect texture and taste.     The pricing is a bit high for diner food - Coffee for $2.30? It was good, but come on.  It was almost enough to knock my review down to four stars, but everything was so good, I'm hoping they just pay a bit more for their ingredients - or to their servers.  Maybe THAT explains why they're working there.  I guess it's money well-spent in that case.  One thing I know - it's certainly not spent on the decor.  But that's just the way this NY'er likes it.",

    "text": "So, we went on the busiest day of the week, Sunday. We didn't follow our friends' suggestions (Eggs Maximilian and Eggs Benedict). And, sadly, we weren't impressed.  First off, protect yourself in the parking lot. It's reminiscent of Death Race with people cruising around the parking lot in strange contorted circles, trying to guess where the exiting 4-top has parked in order to get into position.  My husband was waiting for a place (as in already stationary) when a woman in VW backed up several cars and expected him to move.  She was lovely. . . like jumping cholla is lovely that is.  The staff are definitely friendly.  One of the servers dropped a plastic roach on my menu for my 3 year old while I was holding him.  How was he to know that I am unreasonably afraid/disgusted by them?  He was trying to be nice.  It looked so real that the kids were afraid to touch it and instead tried to use my hand to prod it to see if it would move.  Luckily, when our server came to take our order, the roach stayed inside the menu and would be a surprise for some future diner. (No, I do not feel bad about that.)   Between the four of us, we ordered The Cisco (french toast/eggs/bacon combo), eggs and Canadian bacon, and Huevos Rancheros with both the green chili and red salsa.  The french toast came out hot and was decent, scrambled eggs were fine, and bacon crispy.  The Huevos was next.  Big disappointment. Beans were nearly cold, the green chili was just warm, eggs were cooked perfectly, but the plate just didn't do anything for us.  The green chili was very unremarkable. (Tortilla was good.)  The Canadian bacon was the roughest piece of CB I've ever seen, gristle around the edge and fat.  The eggs on the Canadian bacon plate were ordered over easy, but served over hard.  Coffee is weak. I'd have to say I like the bacon best which was crispy and thick.   I think my expectations were way too high for this place.  That being said, my husband had no expectations, and he said he wouldn't bother to go back.  If you go - maybe stick with the Eggs Max with chorizo.  That seems to be the #1 hit.  And watch yourself in the parking lot!",

The potatoes were cold. The eggs were over cooked. Almost no runny egg yolk. The sauce was for sure from a can. Over all the eggs Benedict was so salty. I could not eat one whole egg one a muffin. It was served with ham instead of Canadian bacon as the menu list. I must have caught then on a very bad day.",

    "text": "Oh Harlow's... you messed up by getting rid of your cooks. First of all, you currently do not have the same cooks as you did for the last 20 years so please update your website. You need to find a way to make peace with your old cooks, bring them back, and pay them more! Cut corners somewhere else, but definitely not with your cooks. We waited 30 minutes for traditional breakfast when we use to wait literally less than 5. The quality of the food sucked! It really did. I'm sorry, but it use to be 100% better. My scrambled eggs were so scrambled and chopped up, there was nothing to them. I have never ate a piece of egg as small as a piece of cereal. The potatoes were raw, mushy, and not flavorful or crispy like in the past. My biscuit was dry, not fluffy, and tasted old. We noticed several other tables with practically full plates, as it seems many others were dissatisfied. One good thing was our server Taylor. She informed us straight up that there would be a longer wait as the kitchen was backed up. It was nice of her to give us a heads up, but we are regulars and knew wait times have never been before so I look up and notice new cooks who looked lost and a stack of pending orders lined up waiting.  Get your shit together! We will not be back ever again unless the old cooks are there popping plates out hot and fresh. Your business is sinking in the mud and you will not be able to recover if you don't make changes quick. Denny's is above you at the moment, what does that say? Very disappointed and I know I wasn't the only one, so soon I'm afraid you won't have any customers. Please Please bring back your old cooks as they rocked the house.",

So convenient, we ate there the three mornings we were in town. The breakfast menu is large with many options.  The french toast, pancakes, egg sandwich and homemade chorizo are off the hook.  The homefries, not so much.  I found them to be a bit bland tasting.   I just asked for them to be well done, which helped a little. The service was pleasant and fast. The place was busy every day, so my guess is it's a local favorite and I understand why.",

Once seated we were greeted right away. Service was very quick and friendly. I had the eggs benedict. The Hollandaise was tangy just like I like it. I didn't care for the ham on it, it was smoked with a strong flavor. Overall it was good but I also wish the breakfast potatoes had more crunch to them, they needed to be browned longer.",

Really good flavor and no greasy fattiness. I was very happy. Came with country potatoes (again, not greasy) and biscuits.

They have quick, smart, friendly wait staff that are very accommodating and detail oriented. Came on a Tuesday and they were will busy. Their parking lot is all sorts of weird as parking spaces go in every direction but you'll figure it out.  Sat at the counter top as always. Bar and countertop service is always the best.  The menu is seemingly gigantic but is really manageable.   It seems they are known for their salsa and hangover cures so I asked what to go with and was recommended anything with house made chorizo. Went with the Eggs Maximilian and it was legit! Def try! Two people drink and breakfasts. 25$. Solid value and great deal! Will def be back to explore more options.",

We tried to eat here some time ago, but that was around 10 A.M. on a Saturday. Seeing that there was a crowd waiting for a table outside, and that there was no parking in the lot whatsoever, we abandoned all hope and ate somewhere else for breakfast. Fast forward to today- a crisp, sunny Saturday at 7 A.M. We figured not many people would be getting breakfast this early, so we headed over, hoping that the 2nd time is the charm!  There were only 2 or 3 other people in the restaurant when we arrived, but more trickled in as the morning progressed. The interior is a mix of '70s old paneled wood walls juxtaposed with aged posters of various old time movie stars, such as Errol Flynn and Mae West.   The menu is similarly designed, with a variety of different traditional breakfast items named after classic movie stars. They do have a section devoted to more Southwestern cuisine though, which is what we ended up ordering. I had the Maximillian. It was a large heaping portion of perfectly grilled potatoes, green chile, with a circle of fluffy, scrambled eggs and spicy salsa on top (No sour cream on request). It was such a hefty meal I could only finish half.  Service was friendly and lightning quick. It seemed like only minutes after we ordered, we received our food. Drinks were refilled as needed.  If you can get here early enough, breakfast is a very pleasant experience. I'm not so sure I'd venture here when it gets super busy though!",

Now since you have got past my first section you must still be relatively interested on how I can give Harlow's 5 Stars when its a breakfast spot. First off the tradition. Harlow's has been a staple in Tempe for years. It looks something you would find in the woods and is super welcoming. Also for the guys out there not only is the food great but a majority of the support staff is also excellent.   Now this place does get slammed so be prepared for a potential wait. I have only gone during the week with clients and at the most its been 5-10 minutes. Since I don't like most breakfast food I also go with the corned beef hash or the green chile burrito. They are both amazing and you leave not only feeling full but prepared for an afternoon nap.   All in all you NEED to try Harlows you won't regret it.",

The eggs I ordered as \"over medium\" we're very runny, and the breakfast of huevos rancheros just weren't my style. I understand everyone has their own version of what huevos rancheros should be so I didn't hold that against them and figured to give them another chance. My next visit I ordered the bacon, eggs (over medium), hash browns with a biscuit.  They brought out my food and I was disappointed right away. The eggs were hard, and you could see on top one of the eggs the yolk had broke and was fried hard. The other egg had no yolk as well. The bacon was burnt and crumbly, and the biscuit was very dry and broke to pieces when I tried to cut and butter.  The only half way decent item was the hash browns and they were dry as I had no yolk to mix with them. Two chances and both were fails, I won't be going back and instead will just hit the Denny's down the street. Sad that 's a better option.",

They fill up and are always full because it's so popular and so good.  There are always people leaving so it's usually not more than a 20 min wait at the most.  They have a huge menu with a huge variety.  It's a little pricier but worth it.  I would eat here every weekend if i could.  Another place i will miss when i move out of AZ.    ps. Great place for a hangover.",

I tend to judge breakfast joints by there their eggs benedict and Harlows has the second best I have ever had.  The hollandaise sauce is thick and lemony and eggs done as perfect as can be.

Large breakfast selection, sure to please everyone. All the food I've experienced was excellent but now I stick to the half order of biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs, that's more than enough.  It is a little more expensive than your typical breakfast place but the quality of the food and service makes it worth your while. Ask for Cody, she is the best server they've got.  Just a heads up, their rule is that they don't split checks no matter the size of the party. Along with that your only aloud 2 credit cards per check, everything else must be cash. Still worth it though.",

The biscuits were fresh but just dense enough to provide a good foil for the gravy.  The accompanying bacon was crisp & delicious.  Coffee was surprisingly good--much better than you usually get at restaurants like this.  The service was excellent & friendly--my coffee cup never got close to empty.  I look forward to returning and trying some of the southwest specialties.  Oh yeah, in the interest of full disclosure, my cousins own and manage the place but I take breakfast too seriously to give False praise.

Not a bad place but pretty standard breakfast fare, no huge standouts to me.  On a side note, there sure are a lot of rules here, presumably to keep people from acting like jerks in such a small space: - no more than 2 split checks - no business meetings - no students studying - surcharge for to-go orders - no substitutions I mean really...",

    "text": "There's something oddly charming about this place. My 2nd experience happened this past weekend - Sunday breakfast at 10 a.m. As I pulled up in my car, I could tell the place was quite popular. I sensed a wait list. I walked in, put down my name and took a seat outside on of their benches. The wait wasn't long - perhaps 5 minutes - and I was shortly shown to my table for two. Few minutes later, my Breakest Buddy showed up. We had concluded to call this \"brunch\" since it was a compromise between breakfast and lunch time. In any case, breakfast foods were on the mind and my belly was ready.   Coffee first, please.   The waitress, you could tell, was rather busy. I didn't mind that, but I did mind her spilling my coffee each time she poured more. Her rush wasn't coupled with friendly pauses, and I felt like I was more of an inconvenience than a patron. In any case, we ordered \"brunch\" and chatted it up. It's not every day I roll out of bed before 10 a.m. on the weekend. This was a special occassion; one well worth it. But, sadly, not because of the breakfast.   The eggs were rubbery and the muffin was hard to swallow without honey. The cottage cheese was good, but how can you screw up that? Yes, I ordered the Hot Body Breakfast. So sue me. My friend ordered panckakes with eggs and bacon. Only half was eaten.   You know, there's something oddly charming about this place. It's a warm cafe, reminiscient of a small town mom & pop establishment. It probably is, and the fact that it's thrown near ASU makes it the preferred after-hang over joint. I can see how rubbery eggs and greasy pork would suit one's belly after a booze fest. But, it's not ideal for the belly without a drop of liquor coating the stomach lining.   I used the bathroom, too. Talk about a tiny walkway stuffed with clutter, like high chairs and cordless vacuums. Again, it's charming in a home-for-breakfast kind of way.   It almost reminds me of Shortcakes. Almost, although Shortcakes is in a train car and has, let's face it, the best after bar and in-the-mood-for-cheap-food appeal. Sadly, it's back near OSU in Stillwater. I miss Shortcakes.   Harlow's wasn't memorable to me. That's probably why I've only been here twice in my life.  Sidebar: I wouldn't call this place \"cheap.\" With plates averaging around 8-10$, that's quite the purse punch that should be met with some delicious raves and reviews. Sadly, to me, it's not worth the moolah.",

    "text": "Desperate for a simple breakfast nook that had cheap eggs, taters, and maybe even a bagel, I found this cheap little listing in the New Times-and its right there off University! Score.  A small place, the parking was pretty easy and while small, the seating was varied (booths, counter, regular two-person table, four people tables, et.) and was distinctly brown. I don't think this place has been renovated since the late 70s. There were vintage movie posters, signs, and the bathroom had this awesome silver Mucha design wallpaper that I so want to steal. My booth was super comfy, the service was like lightening and my coffee didn't taste like diaper water. I got the basic eggs, potatoes, and BISCUIT. Yum! The oj actually was fresh squeezed and a deal at one something. The potatoes tasted like...I don't know. Like dried potatoes with lots of vegetable oil. There were no onions, peppers, additional stuff that goes with home fries. The eggs were fine. The biscuits were huge and it came with 2 of 'em. It was so good and filling I actually got one to go. There were large men having bigger BLTs, guys with tattoos all over (I mean all over), couples still wearing their PJs, mullets, truckers, families-this place attracts them all! I probably won't come back here too often cause with coffee, oj, and the simple breakfast it still came out to close to 10 bucks-not a great deal in my book. But I imagine this place is magic on a hung-over soul.",

I have been going here for a few years now.  I enjoy the atmosphere, the people, the staff - and, most importantly, the food.  Chicken fried steak and eggs?  Oh yeah.  Delicious fish fry on Fridays?  Definitely.  The best club sandwich in town?  No doubt about it.  Of course, I need to mention the wait staff.  There are a number of comments I've seen about how pretty the waitresses are.  Yes, that's True.  More importantly, though, they are some of the best you will find anywhere.  No False flirtiness and no gruffness - just fast, friendly service that makes you feel like they are actually glad you showed up to eat.  It's a welcome change from the service you get in most places these days.  The only flaw?  They're not open 24 hours!  That's probably because they know if they were, then they would have a hard time getting some of us to leave.",

    "text": "This review is based strictly on their burgers.  Why?  I had just downloaded the Yelp mobile app and Harlow's was among the top burger search results for Tempe.  I know it's a great breakfast/sandwich/diner type place, but had never thought of it as a burger destination, until the Yelp mobile results.  So I headed on over.  Here's what I found:  It's not a burger destination.     They offer 5 or so, starting with a basic burger, then different variations based on toppings... green chile, texas chile, bacon focused, etc.  I kept with the basic, plus cheese.  For $8 you get the basic burger with fries, and the variations bump it another dollar or two.  Drinks are extra.    The menu said theirs were char grilled, but I think they are steam table cooked - no char or smokey taste on mine.  Likewise, I appreciate the regular menu featuring a lot of local product sources,  but I'd guess these are from a frozen patty national vendor.  It wasn't bad, but it reminded me of many tailgates where we bought the big pack of frozen patties and simply reheated and cooked them on a grill.  The service was good and fast.  The fries were decent, though nothing unique (also from a frozen bag?).  The bun was ok, and it came with pickle, onion and lettuce.  But it's still unclear if they made them there or used an external source for the patty.    Bottom line:  After tip, I paid $12 for a burger, fires and coke.  There was no \"wow moment.\"  If they produced something unique it might be worth it.  As it stands, I'd definitely recommend the place for other things, but not burgers. It's not their forte.",

It's very small inside and kind of cramped at times but still has a great atmosphere. There's a wait usually on Saturday or Sunday mornings. Great breakfast food (I like \"The Ranger\" the best)! .

Atmosphere was incredibly busy for a Saturday morning and the diner was filled with lots of \"bros\" from ASU. Our waitress was friendly but the hostess was absolutely not doing her job. Came in and was not greeted by her and as my girlfriend and I left she didn't  have the courtesy to look up at us as we left. The food was mediocre at best. Pretty standard breakfast food. Good sized portions. Everything on the menu seemed to be overpriced by about 2.5$. The real travesty I think though is their coffee. Both my girlfriend and I received a cup and instantly turned me off to the place. While sitting and waiting for our meal or reading the menu it's the coffee that makes the wait bearable and in my opinion enjoyable. Tried a sip and immediately looked at my girlfriend in disgust. Incredibly watery. Someone obviously did not use enough grounds. When I brought it up to our waitress she tried to make an excuse that it was because it was a Kona blend and that she was aware that it was weak. She did offer to replace the cup but it didn't make much difference. The only saving grace was that she didn't charge us for the coffee.   Overall a pretty mediocre experience. Not a place I would ever recommend for breakfast unless you are a hung over frat boy who doesn't have the taste bud capacity to differentiate between good and bad coffee.    Main fix: work on your coffee situation. First impressions are everything and mine was weak.",

    "text": "What took me so long to go here?  I can't wait to go back. This \"Eggs Maximilian\" thing I experienced on Sunday was like everything I love on a plate! Eggs, veggies, salsa, potatoes, cheese, a metric ton of green chiles, and a dollop of sour cream all served on a tortilla. As a non-pork eater I love when I can order breakfast straight off the menu without exceptions (though you can add chorizo and get your oink on). Holy crap was it good. WAY too much food though, I could only eat half. I had a really hard time deciding what to order here...the menu is extensive. About a 10 minute wait for late breakfast on Sunday morning, about 11:30, not bad at all!",
