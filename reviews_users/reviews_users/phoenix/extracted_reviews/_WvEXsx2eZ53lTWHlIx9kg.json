    "text": "JESUS MARY AND JOSEPH [hysterics pertaining to cocktail menu].  If one yelp star is equivalent to one cocktail ordered, 5 stars. If one yelp star is equivalent to the number of stars seen each time a sip is had, 242 stars (approximate). Four of the five drinks I ordered here were some of the best I've ever had. Here are those I oh so wholeheartedly recommend:  The Lost Melody [Smirnoff, grapefruit liqueur, coconut cream, grapefruit juice, rose flower water] - Sweet and zesty, but complex, like Nicole Kidman wearing lip smackers. The coconut cream was subtle and added textural notes, any subsequent creaminess was barely present. The Smirnoff, grapefruit liqueur, and grapefruit juice blended nicely into a cohesive chorus. The spritz of rose water was like a whimsical kiss complimenting the coconut and grapefruit yet standing out entirely on its own. Eyes wide shut as I catch the last drop.  The Lawless [Dickel rye, \"truck stop\" bitters (house creation), wormwood liqueur, tobacco smoke] - What I'd imagine Pierce Brosnan might order. Throughout the night my girlfriend and I were hit with allusive wafts of some enchanting smokey-burnt vanilla scent. Thanks to a few rich old dogs at the end of the bar, we discovered it was The Lawless. As noted above, the drink is made with vanilla-laced tobacco smoke. The tobacco is set on a small stone skillet, torched to flames, and then cupped by an icey-chilled glass, allowing the embers to smolder and suffocate within. The stone skillet and upside-down smoke filled glass are placed in front of you, the glass is turned upright, and the previously mixed rye and wormwood concoction is hastily poured into the smokey abyss before the buildings' ventilation system ruins everyones fun. The smoke isn't just a good show -- it adds a bold extrasensory element that can be noted most obviously in the sip or two before the smoke dissipates but also more subtly like a fragrant ghost lingering in the since tar-glazed inside walls of the glass itself. The drink is icey but earthy, rugged but debonair. Two fingers of drink are comprised of silky-strong Dickle rye, savory-musky house mixologist made \"truck stop\" bitters, and a sweet ethereal essence of which by process of elimination I must conclude is the wormwood liquor. This drink is the definition of dapper, the last word in the book of brawn, and I will forever seek a drink of this caliber and excellence, though I am afraid I will forever be underwhelmed. More on this drink by PUNCH can found here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpunchdrink.com%2Frecipes%2Flawless&s=06140637bc1afe70b75d35517b1431e3fe76d885ba3f756ed731f60670ab3aa7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">punchdrink.com/recipes/l...</a>  The Oaxacan Punch [Partida reposada, pierre ferrand brandy, passion fruit horchata (house made), nutmeg] - Note: the horchata is house made. Something about this drink makes me feel all winter cabin, open fire, and knit sweaters. Sweet, warm, nutty, wholesome deliciousness. For the skeptics: the passion fruit element isn't overly distinct, adding only a slight tangy agitation to the other flavors, expanding the drink as a whole.   The Darkness [Bols, vida mezcal, montenegro, lemon, lavender, egg white] - This was, of all the drinks ordered, the least impressive. Not because it wasn't outstanding relative to literally anywhere else you might order an egg white cocktail, but because it was among all of the other perplexingly excellent concoctions the Blue Hound has to offer. This drink is timeless and refined. The faint note of lavender was my favorite element of the drink, though as a whole is exceptionally cohesive and balanced.   In summation: Perusing the remaining items of the cocktail menu, you might see other interesting ingredients like sarsaparilla, pink pepper watermelon shrub, and celery bitters -- only adding to the sentiment that I wish I could have tried all the things. Located in the lobby of a luxury hotel, the atmosphere has an air of money and high-art, lending itself more toward the hip-young-adult / professional-fancy-pants realm, although impresively refraining from feeling uncomfortable, stuffy, or exclusive. The Blue Hound is an exemplary model everything a cocktail bar can be and I am stoked that my week-long Phoenix visit yielded such a discovery. I will be scouring my home city of Boston for anything that can hold a candle (or a bunch of burning vanilla tobacco) to this dashing top-notch joint.",

    "text": "I've frequented Blue Hound Kitchen for many fantastic cocktails for happy hour. Their drinks are great.   I was also under the impression that their fries were phenomenal, but I need to emphasize that the happy hour and dinner fries are phenomenal. They're actually what the menu described: thick cut, rosemary, Parmesan delights--perfectly crunchy outsides; soft, fluffy insides. However, if you go during lunch, you'll receive flimsy, salty shoestring fries. A disappointing fact I learned when seven coworkers and I decided to give Blue Hound a try for lunch.   Do not try Blue Hound for lunch. Besides the sad fries (which the server took off our bill because of our resounding disappointment), the black quinoa salad was not made with black quinoa and it didn't appear to be much of a salad, more like a pilaf. It was also one of the blandest things I've ever had. And at the meal's end, the server tried to charge $10 per quinoa salad when the menu listed it at $9.  The piquillo pepper sandwich was just all right. The Chex mix appetizer lacked any Chex, and the pickled vegetables were less pickled and more just doused in vinegar. Other people at the table enjoyed the bison jerky and their oh-so-juicy looking burgers, but overall the vibe was \"meh.\"   Their lunch special (two mini apps, salad, and sandwich for two people to split for $11/person) is a good deal. But even at that price, I was not blown away by the food. I would've hulk smashed something had I paid full price for anything.   In short, the sad (and subsequently free) lunch fries were the best part of the meal. That's not good.  P.S. My friend wants me to mention that the bartender Dante is a great guy and should not in any way be related to this poor review.",

For one thing, they have excellent short ribs here! I've longed for fall off the bone ribs since I first tasted them at some hole in the wall up in Michigan during my college days. The mac 'n' cheese was a get pairing, it came out hot & cheesy, cooked with shells so it had a stuffed taste to it. The deviled eggs were also one of my faves of the night.  The outdoor patio isn't large, but they have enough sitting to fit several tables and at least 2 large parties, we picked a perfect night to enjoy the weather, so I'd definitely recommend doing the same if you can.  I've heard they've got a great bar, which from the looks of passing it appears to be True. For an up and coming area, this restaurant fits in well.",

    "text": "The perfect first date in downtown Phoenix.  Went here with two sorority sisters after seeing The Nutcracker at Symphony Hall. It was a late dinner for a Sunday night. I ordered Tommy's Margarita and they each got a glass of red wine and sparkling champayne. The entrance to this place (located in/near City Scape) is so stunning. The waiting area has these lush, new age couches and exterior decor on the walls as wall art. It's very cool to see. We were escorted to the back dining room near the patio (which overlooks city scape and all of downtown PHX, yeah it is as amazing as you're thinking) past the bar area and group seating tables.   I ordered the endless caramel popcorn for the table and it was such a surprise! Infused with a chile pepper, this was not your mama's caramel popcorn for sure. My sisters ordered the mushroom soup and a kale leaf caesar salad. Both had very high remarks.  For dinner we orded the New England scallops, another kale salad and duck flatbread. I can't speak for them but everything was fantastic! The scallops were so soft and had a plate of seasoned tomatoes and gac under. That made the flavor explode in your mouth.  I would totally go back here for pre-show drinks and apps. Or even on a date. It's so great.",

First exposure to this place was at the Best Of Phoenix event at the Science Center, back in October. There they were serving a duck pate that was soo good I went back 3 times. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it again, but since then they've taken it off the menu, apparently people didn't order it enough. Well \"people\" have bad taste because that pate was incredible.   Tonight, at the suggestion of a new friend's tweet (Proof: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FGPJFF%2Fstatus%2F280127623324123137&s=062667ea1caebbbe335396b11a54b1cc013b0bd64a00662db5f3058b7666d323\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">twitter.com/GPJFF/status...</a>) I ordered the Kentucky Fried Quail and it was UH-mazing, especially that scrumptious gravy with the red beans.  My friends ordered the Prosciutto Flatbread (the pesto on it is soooo gooood!!) and the Short Rib (it's huge! He got a half order and couldn't finish it, even with sharing). We started with the Tater Tots with that really nice harissa (sp?) sauce, which I had never had before, and the Pulled Pork johnny cakes.   What topped it all off though, were the incredibly rich desserts. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I never get dessert when I go out, but dang! The Doughnut Holes and that xocolatl (sp?) sauce just put me over the moon! Sooo good! Also, the Bread Pudding was cruciallll with the bacon ice cream? Bomb. So, so bomb.   Nuff said, I'm coming back. I miss it already. Mmmmmmm",

We took the opportunity to sample a number of different items since it was more family style, which unexpected, but perfect for trying a new restaurant with so many wonderful items. The small family farmed cheese plate was amazing!  I'm not even a big cheese fan, but it was delish!  Next we had the green chili roasted corn.  When this came out it was still on the cob, and they happily took it off the cob for us.  Again, another amazing dish.  Then we had the Kobe Beef Short Ribs - again, wonderful!  It does look like they have changed their menu some in the last month, but I would definintely check it out!",

    "text": "I admit, I have been a bad Yelp citizen, always using, never contributing ratings.  But the last two nights at The Blue Hound have forced my hand.  For our weekend getaway at the Palomar, we decided to try the hotel restaurant the first night. We went all in, having the \"Chef and Bar Squad Geek Out\" tasting menu.  Wow.  We had terrific service from our server (forgot his name), and personal visits from Adrienne (or Cheyenne?), the GM.  The chef even tailored our selections for my wife's selective palate (no seafood, nothing raw).  Then he personally delivered and described each amazing course.  And the pairings from the bar were perfect.  Our favorite was the spiced up version of a Singapore Sling.  A great evening.  The next night, we had reservations at a neighboring restaurant, The Arrogant Butcher, mainly because of their prime rib special.  We were joined by my dad, and seated just before 7.  After we ordered an appetizer, we were informed that they were out of prime rib.  It was a game day, but one would think with the evening booked through 9 PM with reservations, they would still have had their special at 7 PM.  We left, quite disappointed, with our evening plans a mess.  Then, in a stroke of genius, my wife suggested a return to The Blue Hound.  As soon as we met our server, Zach, we knew the evening would be turning around.  My wife and dad decided to split \"One Big A$$ Steak\", a 36 oz porterhouse, with cast iron scalloped potatoes.  I asked for a half order of the pork belly sliders.  The chef, upon hearing of our disappointing evening, didn't want us to wait for food.  So he sent out a complimentary tater tots appetizer (amazing) followed by an interesting roasted corn on the cob (also delicious).  My wife and father asked for repeats of the spiced up Singapore Sling. I had a Hendrick's gimlet, which the bartender perfected with muddled cucumber (staying clear of lime at my request).  The night was already saved, and then the entrees arrived.  My steak loving wife and my dad LOVED the porterhouse, grilled to perfection.  And just to go even one more step above and beyond, the chef sent me the full order of sliders, because he didn't want me to be jealous of the huge steak.  Over the top.  I have to go with five stars.  This was greatness in all aspects.  We can't wait to return!",

I didn't think we'd need to call in advance since this wasn't a super-busy area, but apparently they were almost booked solid that night. Fortunately they had a cancellation, so after about 30 minutes in the cocktail lounge/reception area, they were able to accommodate us with a table. Both the drink and food menu were adventurous and tantalizing, without being too \"weird\". Our waiter was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and really got to know our tastes before recommending some dishes, which we loved! The food was all cooked and presented well and the service was excellent. It can get a little loud and the tables are close together due to the limited seating area, so I wouldn't take a large group or a romantic date here. Obviously my caution would be to make reservations in advance as the dining room is very small. Additionally, I would not take a non-foodie here as the expense would be wasted on someone who doesn't appreciate food fusion and artistry.",

    "text": "My fiance and I meet up some friends here before heading to the Eddie Vedder concert on 04 November 2012.    Meal:  Between the four people at dinner, we had the Kentucky Fried Quail, Kobe Beef Short Ribs, seasonal daily shortbread (couldn't remember exactly what it was), vintner' salad, collard greens, tatter tots, and the mac n' cheese.  Oh, and we had a ton of cocktails.  I think every person at the table had at least 3 drinks each.  Taste:  Real hit or miss.  Somethings were just off the charts in taste and freshness and some things were incredibly boring.  The cocktails were wonderful and it was apparent they use top shelf stuff.  The mac n' cheese was a real let down.  The collard greens were decent at best.  The quail was good but nothing to write home to momma about.  The beef short ribs were top notch, along with the short bread.  I would think the way to go is to go with whatever is the \"daily special\".  7 out of 10.  Value:  Value was horrible.  I understand that the intent of nicer restaurants is that they don't typically serve huge portions, but at the same time, if you drop $150 (without tip), you expect to be full afterwards.  Don't come hungry because you will leave hungry.  The best value was probably the short ribs. 1 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  I liked the service because our server knew that menu inside and out . . . and she was not shy about giving us recommendations.  I like a server whoisn't afraid to share their opinion and directs you away from a potentially bad dish or experience.  Out server was attentive, funny, and friendly, but at times as a little pushy.  9 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  This is a great atmosphere.  It overlooks the city-scape and architecture design is beautiful.  It has a very young yet sophisticated feel to it, but almost any age demographic will fit in.  5 out of 5.  Overall:  Next time I come here, I would probably just come for the drinks and get a small appetizer instead of a full meal.  The atmosphere, drinks, and service is what really makes this place stand out.  I think this would be a great place to meet someone for a date or if you want to go somewhere upscale prior to a concert near by.  22 out of 30 points, 3 out of 5 stars.",

It was so packed in the restaurant;  however they gave us the option to sit at the bar and wait for available seats. Right away, I felt a  \"stank vibe\"in the in the atmosphere, which I am totally not down for. But none the less I decided to give it a chance considering it could have just been my skewed perception. We did not get greeted promptly, we actually had to ask for menus and water.  After sitting about for about 10 minutes, a waiter comes over and asks what we'd like. I did have a lot of questions about the drink menu because I had only been here one other time. The waiter seemed dry, which made me feel some kind of way. So I  trusted my instincts and ordered the Tropical Margarita and it was so good.  I think it had tequila , yellow chartreuse,  basil , and  citrus. The drink made up for the lack of service but I would probably go back again for the great drink I had.",

    "text": "Thank you, Kimpton, for bringing a classy bar, an urban vibe and truly outstanding cocktails to downtown Phoenix. God knows we needed it.   The bar space is what I would call rustic chic with a wood-based design foundation accented with glam/shiny touches. While there is plenty of seating at the fairly large bar, there is also a fantastic long community table parallel to the bar.   The service has been very good so far, with friendly bartenders and servers who are pretty prompt in delivering the drinks, which is no small feat given that each one is handcrafted and unique. Some of the smaller touches really make the drinking experience standout - from the larger block ice cubes to the daily fruit-infused water, this is definitely the place to quench your thirst and get your buzz on. Many of the drinks are outstanding, but I definitely recommend the Brown Derby (bourbon-based), Queen's Park Swizzle (rum-based) and the Rising Sun (tequila-based). But, of course, many of the others are good too, and you know I've never met an adult beverage I didn't like!   I definitely enjoy the food at Blue Hound as well (the zucchini corn dogs are awesome), but I think the menu is a little light on vegetarian selections. I wish that dishes like the cheddar biscuits and mac and cheese didn't come with bacon and ham automatically or could be made without them.   This little thing aside, though, Blue Hound is a wonderful - and important - addition to downtown Phoenix and I say \"welcome\"!",

    "text": "I don't like writing these type of reviews: If only a restaurant would live up to it's decor and menu-writing, Blue Hound would be a hit. Unfortunately, the food and the service didn't live up to the hype. But in response to all of the four and five-star reviews, there needs to be a dose of reality here, folks. Did we eat the same food?  Let's start with the good: the restaurant is dazzlingly hip, filled with beautiful people accented by only the most sophisticated lighting, and filled with the energetic buzz that set our expectations high. My first thought? \"This will be a home run!\"  I ate there with a group of foodie friends, all of whom were salivating with excitement to try what appeared to be a innovative and tasty menu. And it's received all this positive press; the media is always right...right?  For appetizers, we ordered the Endless Caramel Popcorn (poorly popped kernels seasoned with a non-nuanced avalanche of ancho chile. Where was the butterscotch flavor?) The Tater Tots were underwhelming, and the dip tasted like potato soup out of the can. The Hickman's Farm Deviled Eggs were the one shining moment of the entire meal, with an excellent balance of flavors and textures.   I ordered Bob's Indian Red Peaches salad, for my entree, and was surprised with a very scantily-filled rectangular plate containing a small smattering of peaches, marcona almonds, a tidy--and tiny--pile of pepper cress greens and a few tiny lumps of fromage blanc. The peaches were delicious, but overall, it was all presentation and no substance.   Also ordered was the Ancho Chile Braised Pork Neck which was a soupy concoction with ...er... no apparent sign of pork in it. For $17, Blue Hound, feel free to include a speck of meat. Just sayin.'   When the 4\" wide crock of Mac n' Cheese was set down in front of us (mind you--this is considered an \"entree\") we almost had to giggle at it's diminutive size. Tell me, when one orders mac n' cheese, are they feeling like nibbling on a sample-size portion? I think not. Fail.  Hopes always remain high for dessert, so we ordered with gusto: A few cake n' shakes (the Nutella shake was dismal, and the chocolate cake bites tasted on par with Costco bakery goods), Lemon Blueberry Cheese Cakes (or should they be called tubes? The cheesecake was served in a bewildering tube shape, plopped unappetizingly on a bed of granola and blueberries. Not lovely, but odd.), and an order of the most dry, flavorless mound of Carmelized Pineapple Upside Down Cake ever put into my mouth. It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.  In summary, if you want to blow a few hundred bucks on a lackluster, mediocre and disappointing meal that pretends to be so much more, the Blue Hound is for you. It's a shame.",

The host stand is the face of the establishment, and it's the first thing people see when they enter a place. When my boyfriend and I walked in around 9 and asked for a table they told us there were none available. And literally left it at that. I was like oookay, well can I put my name in? They countered with \"well they all just sat, so it's gonna be awhile...\" So I did a lap around the restaurant and was confused since some people were cashing out. I then approached the hosts again and asked if they had a wait system. They nodded yes. I said okay well how about you put my name in, and tell me how long the wait is. They obliged, with zero enthusiasm or warmth. Luckily 2 spots opened at the bar. Seriously, Blue Hound...you guys are awesome. But your hosts need hospitality training ASAP. We almost left because of them. Glad we didn't because the food/drink is great.",

I really wanted to love all of the food that we tried but I didn't find that they were nearly as exciting as the drinks.   We started with the shishito peppers, deviled eggs, and Ahi Tuna. Tuna was good, but quinoa ball with it lacked flavor.  The peppers were good but too spicy, and this is coming from somebody who really loves spicy food.   I had the pork shank as a main dish with braised greens. It was cooked perfectly and was very tender but not that flavorful, and the greens were extremely salty. My friend had the salmon and said it was good flavor, but a little bit overcooked.  Service was excellent.  Bar was great. Drinks were worth going for...  but the food was just ok.",

We decided since we had been driving all day to just stay and enjoy the amenities and restaurant/bar.  The bar was standing room only because the hotel swimming pool bar was closed for a private party so everyone was trying to get into the Blue Hound bar. My husband finally was able to get us a drink and we ended up sitting in the hotel lobby/atrium area.  I went to the hostess stand outside the building to make a reservation for dinner. I was told the only available table for 2 was at 8, so we waited the 2-1/2 hours till 8, went down to check in and got seated literally right next to the outside door.  The hostess was not pleasant.  We sat there and someone brought us water, we sat there and every time the door opened our menus blew across the table and even people bumped me. I asked the hostess if we could be moved and she said NO (end of that conversation).  We continued to sit there and still no server.   We sat there another 5-10 minutes and still no server. It's not that big of a restaurant that we should sit that long without being acknowledged.  WE LEFT!  So I can't review the food but normally good service means good food.... leaving it at that",

Without a reservation we weren't really expecting to get seated right away but the hostess was great and was able to get us seated.    The service here is fantastic.  Our waiter was great and she was never hovering or too far away.  The food was paced out perfectly as well.  The food was very good.  We started with the fried green tomatoes which were served with a generous portion of crab meat.  I don't think I'd get this again though.  Don't get me wrong, I like crab meat but tomatoes weren't very good and were too thinly cut and for $15, you can do better.  Our entrees were the pork shank and the shrimp and grits.  The shanks was good and the fennel sausage and beans it came with might have been better than shank itself.  The shrimp and grits was creamy and delicious as well.    The cocktails were interesting and very well made so all around this was a great meal.  Docking 1 star because $125 for two people didn't really equate to what we received.  While everything was good, it was overpriced by 15-25%",

As we were having dessert and coffee, tables around us were being set up for breakfast; lots of activity, noise and bumping of our chairs.  Outside patio chairs were brought in with door constantly opening and closing bringing in big bursts of frigid air and adding to noise and general turmoil.

When we arrived the main restaurant was closed to a private party. They directed us around the side and through the back to a small and cold room with no ambience. The menu seemed more limited them before and the specialty drinks that were on the website were not available. There were only two servers running the whole room. Our server never told us her name and when I asked her to explain some of the dishes on the menu she seemed surprised that she had to answer such a question. We had the crispy chicken bites which were not crispy at all, they were rubbery. My pasta was not brought out by my server and a couple of minutes later she came to ask how it was but I hadn't taken a bite yet. After taking a bite I tried to season it with salt and pepper but nothing was coming out of the mills and it really needed flavor, maybe some grated cheese. She never checked on us again and by the time I was full and half way through it was too late. The desert was some kind of pudding-also underwhelming. If they had sold the restaurant out for a private party we would have liked to know that and have the chance to go somewhere else.",

I'm a fan of Kimpton hotels, so I was delighted to learn it was one of their restaurants. The place is really cool - it's got a 20s speakeasy - library lounge type of look to it. The bartenders are even dressed the part.   I didn't have drinks here, just food. This place is like a gastropub, so everything on the menu sounded amazing. I ordered the deviled eggs, the tater tots, and the tagliatelle. The deviled eggs were all right - there was bacon mixed in with the yolk. Not the best deviled eggs I've ever had. The tater tots were good - they also had bacon inside and the inside had a very hash browny texture. It came with a dipping sauce, but that tasted weird. The tagliatelle pasta had roasted squash, wild mushrooms, in the sauce was a walnut pesto. It sounded amazing on paper, but this tasted really weird. And there was too much sauce that overpowered the pasta noodles and the squash and the mushrooms. I didn't really like it and wouldn't order it again.   Overall the food was just okay - it didn't amaze me. The food sounded good in theory on paper, and the presentation was really nice, but the taste and quality weren't enough to make me want to return. The service was good though. The hostess was really nice and friendly. The bartenders were adequate. And the food came out quickly. The best part of this place is the look of the interior.",

How much do I miss Chef Stephen Jones here?  A lot.  Since coming here from the first week it opened to my last visit last night and from every visit in between, something's gone missing from this place.  None of the food we had last night was bad.  The cocktails here are still very good and might bump it up to 4 stars, but I can't quite yet.  We ordered deviled eggs and boudin balls for appetizers.  The deviled eggs were filled with a bacon jam that was dry, inelegant at best.  But it all tasted fine together.  The boudin balls were filled with appeared more to be pulled pork than boudin.  I've had amazing boudin in Washington DC at DBGB Kitchen and some great boudin balls in New Orleans - these fell way short.  But again, tasted fine.  We got the chopped salad.  it was huge.  Almost too huge.  It is a heavy, heavy salad.  It's a riff on the chopped salad from The Gladly/Citizen Public House.  Dried corn for nice sweet crunch, lots of fregula for some chew and weight, avocados, romaine, heirloom plum tomatoes.  The dressing was a little heavy and every was just a tad . . . heavy.    Wife got the handmade pasta with some vegetables in a marinara sauce.  It was on the soft side of al dente, just shy of being overcooked.  But, as with everything else we tasted, it tasted \"fine.\"  This place has lost its pizzazz.  The service was great, there was a loud bachelorette party going on but that's not a regular thing, and the food was, unfortunately, nothing to write home about.  We miss the old Blue Hound.  Hoping they can bring back some of the magic.",

    "text": "I just landed in Phoenix for a few days, and since this is my very first time I wanted to kick it off with some good food.  After looking around on yelp, I found that this promising restaurant is in my very own hotel, so I figured what better way to start my trip than with some nice smoked meat.  The pulled pork on the menu seemed like the thing for me, but as I was talking to the waiter he mentioned that their burger was just voted the best in Phoenix.  I asked and he said that they grind their own meat.  So, never being one to turn down a good burger, I figured that would be a great start.  After the fact, I realize the fatal flaw in my plan was that I never asked if Phoenix was known for it's burgers...  I ordered an iced tea, and a burger (rare) with an over-easy egg on top.  Here are the details:  First, the iced tea is not very good as far as iced tea goes.  I asked the first server (not my waiter) if it was fresh brewed before I ordered it, and he said yes.  However, what came was a cloudy, bitter, iced tea that usually indicates that it came from a mix, or concentrate.  Second, my first burger arrived (yes, first).  Normally, I don't send food back, but it was REALLY SALTY. My lips were burning after the first bite. Beyond that, it was cooked medium or medium well.  I don't honestly know the difference when it gets that cooked.  It was chewy though.  Third, my second burger arrived.  It was seasoned well, but still overcooked.  It was dry and chewy.  Even the egg didn't make it better.  Maybe it would be good for someone who likes their burgers more well-done.  The bacon was good though.  Overall, I think they probably pre-cook their burgers and then heat them up to serve, as that would explain why they can't cook them to order.  The service was good.  I liked my waiter, and the manager did ask if he could bring me anything else, but I learned long ago not to go for a third try.  So, the two stars is not for the service, it is for the food.",

    "text": "I came in for late night cocktails and was blown away by the quality and the professionalism of the staff. The cocktails are very well-conceived and nothing you could expect to find anywhere else, and even their takes on classics go above and beyond. They have a wide selection of high-quality spirits, and the bartenders are very competent and willing to meet you where you're at. If you want to stick with a classic you know and love, they'll hit it out of the park. If you want to try something for the first time and just have them make something up, they'll hit it out of the park.  The only cautionary notes I would throw out is that the place is not a bargain, and it's a bit... fancy. I rode my bike in and felt pretty out of place in tennis shoes and jeans. (An important note, though, the bartenders were still more than friendly and professional.)  tl;dr Come here to experience fine cocktails in a classy setting made by friendly, savvy bartenders. And if you're gonna be fancy, get fancy.  Also! If you're a Bourbon Fan, they have a specialty cocktail that incorporates the smoke of pipe tobacco. My friends and I are still talking about it a week later!",

    "text": "Really liking the vibe here.  I like how the bar and lobby start to blend with a full house.  It is definitely a cocktail joint and the beer on tap continues to grow.  Have been about twice a week since they opened.  The food offers a wide variety to choose from and I like that many of the apps and entrees are created for a sharing environment. I've worked my way thru the menu pretty quickly.  Here's some suggestions:  *Starters* Tater Tots Deviled Eggs Warm Mixed Nuts Citrus Olives  Roasted Beets Heirloom Tomato Salad (Tasty, but 3 slices was not worth the price)  *Main Dishes* Mac N Chees Short Ribs     (The gravy boat dish is cool, but the rib needs to be cut into smaller pieces)  *Dessert* Cheese Cake with Tortilla Ice Cream    I'm not the biggest fan of dairy, but Tortilla Ice Cream is great!  All in all, I'm happy with the cocktails and apps at any hour.  You do pay for the upscale environment to be downtown, but I feel it's worth the experience.  The elevated view out of the windows is a spectacular over the city.  The biggest perk is you can head upstairs to Lustre's rooftop bar for a night cap.  You'll see a lot of the same staff working both bars.  I recommend for anyone especially the Scottsdale crowd before catching a game",

Unfortunately the short rib was all fat,  I took two bites of the short rib hoping it would get better., it was pure white fat.  I felt sick from eating it and was asked if I would like another rib.  Unfortunately after eating two pieces I was grossed out from the fat.   I also was offered 10 percent off my tab for the short rib?  I only had two bites and got 10 percent off?? I was honestly angry at that point, I did not eat it, they took it away, and now I am going to pay for it?  Luckily the manager corrected the bill and said it was a miss communication between him and the server.    Maybe after the corrections to the menu and items offered this will be a great place to eat.  After being subjected to the most fat consumed in 2 bites I am going to pass on this place and wait it out.  Hopefully some other Yelpers can try out new menu items so I am not the test subject for it.",

After walking all the way around the block from Charming Charlie, entering the Hotel Palomar and taking the elevator to the second floor, we entered the bar... only to find we could have just exited Charming Charlie and walked right across the courtyard to a second entrance!  The bar was hopping, so we snagged one of the last seating areas - directly across from the host stand.  We sat on leather ottomans and waited for our waitress.  The waitress appeared within a couple minutes and grabbed us a bar menu.  We looked at the menu for several minutes before deciding on:  me - Queen's Park Swizzle him - Brown Derby  The Queen's Park Swizzle was like the Mexican Flag colored version of a mojito.  It was good, but not great.  That said, it was pretty strong.  The Brown Derby was delicious, with just the right hint of citrus.  Our cocktails were $8 each before tax and tip, so we stopped at one each.  Besides, we had a birthday night schedule to stick to!    In this area of town, there are a lot of choices.  Blue Hound won't likely be one of mine.    I could be convinced to try out their happy hour, but I don't know that I'd stick around for the food.  This place is a little too... uhhh... \"hip\" for me.  I actually HATED the artwork and the seating was uncomfortable.  The lighting was pretty cool, though (check out the pictures I snapped).  Overall, I'd say I was teetering between a 3 and 4... but I chose to award the place 3 stars because my cocktail was not spectacular for the price.",

    "text": "Hmm, where to start....  Walking in, was greeted by a friendly hostess and place has a modern/rustic feel which I enjoyed.  I ordered a Bloody Mary to start and it was pretty good.  Had good spice to it, wasn't too heavy on the tomato juice side. Good flavor and simple, didn't come with an entire salad bar which I don't care for so that was a plus.     For the food: I ordered the chicken and waffles. While they weren't bad there definitely wasn't anything special either.  Overall they just lacked flavor.  If you've had LoLos before these do not even come close.  Just bland over all.  To me the best thing on the plate that had the most flavor was the syrup.     Service was good so no complaints there.  While I would give this place one more chance I wouldn't order the same thing again.  It is on the pricey side so I guess I expected more a punch for the price.     If you do come I'd say perhaps temper any expectations you may have and just take it as it is.",

It has a nice patio though that looks over a pretty courtyard that houses an ice skating rink in the winter in the middle of the skyscrapers.  It feels like a little bit of NYC in the middle of Phoenix.    Bar is western/miner themed.  Crowd is more middle aged/mature.  Not a fancy bar, it is surprisingly on the casual side for the professional area it is in.  Drinks were pretty good.  Bartenders' skills are pretty high here.  Selection of alcohol is outstanding.",

I had the seared tuna salad and I can honestly say it was by far the best I've ever had. It has a very unique flavor, not the typical salad. Had I been staying in town another day, I would have absolutely gone back and had it again!  My son had the turkey club which he also enjoyed. The fries that came with the sandwich were so freaking good. They were super crispy on the outside but almost airy/hollow on the inside.  Uh oh, I'm starting to drool...",

There were empty tables in the dining area during our meal so the 3 hour wait seemed incorrect.  Maybe she meant 3 hours to get a table in the bar?     We really enjoyed our food.  The staff was friendly and efficient.   We had:   - The BHKC Chop - Full of textures and flavors - Local Mixed Greens - Overdressed even for my husband's taste which means it had far too much dressing on it  - Pappardelle - rich and hearty - Blackened salmon - A little too salty but when eaten with the celery root puree it was very good   - Apple pie - wonderful!  It was noisy meal due to the busy, large bar area.",

When we were walking in, there was a sign that said \"entrance on patio\" I asked about it and a girl in red pants was extremely inconvenienced by my confusion and even more rude showing me where to go. Once we got in, there was no where to sit. Finally, some seats at the bar opened up and the couple sitting there offered their seats to us. The bartender would not let us sit there and had the seats removed. He said they were removing the seats for more space for standers. Fast forward about fifteen minutes and half our drinks gone, a party of four comes in just as a party is leaving. The arriving party was offered the seats by the departing party. The SAME bartender who denied us seats and even had them removed, let the arriving party sit and even continued to serve them! Seems like he was okay with anyone and everyone sitting except us. Bad experience from the time we were walking in, greeted by the rude girl with red pants. Wanted to enjoy this place but didn't.",

We went to a nearby place for a drink because their bar was packed. After an hour no one text to say our table was ready so we waited another 20 minutes and decided to bail and had dinner elsewhere. Everyone in our party wanted to see the pop up bar so we headed back to the bar where we had the worse drinks! My husband asked for Sapphire gin and we watched her pour some random gin, I asked for a splash of cranberry and got half of a glass. Bartenders need a training on how to make drinks at this bar. We also never received a text or call about our table!",

    "text": "We stopped here by recommendation of Royce K. The hostess was on the phone and did not acknowledge us, but Nicolette stopped by and noticed it, she offered to assist us and answered our questions. We were specifically looking for a ribeye, and they did not have any, so we left. We were looking for a place within walking distance of Hilton Garden Inn Downtown. We did not find a good option for ribeye, but since Nicolette had mentioned a New York strip special they had, we decided to go back.  (I quickly made a reservation through my phone and we were seated right away, earlier we had been told the main dining area was quite busy and we were encouraged to sit at the bar, but with the reservation we were able to sit at the dining area... In a very weird corner and they were not even busy) As it turns out Nicolette was our server and she took really good care of us, from the brief interaction earlier we already knew she was going to be great. Hubby had a Long Island Iced Tea that was served in a super skinny tall glass with of course big ice cubes, so the portion was very small (not so happy about that detail), but then our dinner arrived and it was amazing. Hubby had the flat iron steak and he enjoyed it very much, I had the New York strip special and it was delicious. I had asked Nicolette to request a very fatty cut and it was just what I was needing (I am doing pseudo keto diet and had a marathon to run the next day). My steak came with loaded mashed potatoes (hubby enjoyed those), green beans, and some sort of squash, I asked for extra butter for the green beans and everything was delicious.  Hubby had the pineapple upside down for dessert, it came with pineapple gelato, I had a microscopic sample of each and it was good, the gelato was very tasty without being overly sweet. Over all a very good experience.",

It was a chilly evening, but they moved all kinds of heaters around our table to make everyone comfortable.   First up....It's hard to find the door! Our Uber driver dropped us off at the address and we were like...where is it?? You have to walk up the large cement stairs and then you'll see the cool neon blue dog sign. Inside - it's gorgeous! COOOOOL bar area with these neat hanging lights. Great place for a date!! LOVE the vibe.   The drinks are awesome! I tried the Hibiscus Belle Fleur drink and it came with a beautiful flower in the glass. So fun, and so tasty. Kind of sweet, but not overly so. Everyone at the table loved their cocktails. It seems like they are all worth trying.   We shared almost every single appetizer so we could try different things. Everyone freaked out about the deviled eggs! They have bacon jam at the bottom. Wowza. My favorite two appetizers were the flatbread and the sunchokes. But everything was great. I think it would be fine to just have a bunch of apps for dinner - they are that good.   Someone in my party was craving the hamburger from the website photo... Turned out they ran out at lunch time! So no burgers at dinner.   I had the roasted chicken as my entree. I received two chicken pieces, still on the bone. Very juicy and well seasoned. There was a lot of quinoa on my plate. i was wishing there was more butternut puree or more veggies. It was a good meal.   I recommend this place for sure. Good for groups and also good for dates. It's not a place for kids - very adult vibe. I would come back if I'm in Phoenix visiting again.",

My husband has the shrimp and grits and let me say, those grits were incredibly flavorful and smooth. Our friends got the buratta salad and pork shank. I was told it was the best pork shank he had had before. The buratta salad was very good with great crusty bread...my friend wish it had more tomatoes. Our kids got pasta that ended up costing same as an adult even though it was butter and Parmesan cheese...they didn't that option on the kids menu. We kept watching the desserts go by and they looked amazing but we didn't get one because we were full. It was a pricey dinner but very good and enjoyed it all!",

    "text": "So I hate to write a somewhat negative review, BUT, maybe it was an off night.  Or maybe the last time my husband and daughter went, it was exceptional then. They brought me back, our third time to the restaurant, to try the Ricotta Gnudi.  They loved it so much they wanted me to try to duplicate it at home.  But since we were in town, I figured I would try it.  The time before it was evidently filled with mushrooms.  Brimming with srooms so much that the dish was filling then.  This time, not one mushroom.  And it was the serving size of a ladle.  Which one do s accurate?!?  But both my husband and daughter said it was disappointing.  The Brussel Sprouts were great tho.  The next disappointment worth mentioning was that my husband ordered the Salmon as he usually does at any restaurant.  They brought out the Lamb Osco Brusco (?) can't remember exact name. He didn't want to complain, so he ate it, but I can tell he was disappointed.  The third major disappointment was my 11 yr old ordered the Sirloin.  We had asked about a pasta for her, but not the carbonara.  So she ordered the steak and we asked if she could get fries with it instead of another side.  She said it doesn't come with a side, but we could order the family style sides.  She suggested the potatoes which my 11 yr old wouldn't touch.  What was incredibly disappointing is that she brought out steak fries for my 19 yr old with her steak.  Talk about a disappointing experiences. We also ordered the family style mushrooms, and they were burnt on the ends, but also cold to eat.  Disappointing experience and good when they were clearly not busy on a Sunday evening.",

    "text": "Ate at Blue Hound tonight with some co- workers. Overall, all 7 of us were disappointed. First off let me say that the hostess and the bar back were kind. Besides those two- everyone else seem to be extremely unhappy to be working. The bartender with the long beard and the ponytail was extremely unfriendly. It is not that hard to smile and be nice to your guests. He was shaking his head it was obvious that he was poff at something. I ordered my $35 steak medium and it came well done. My coworker did not receive her food until after we had all finished ours. She had been watching it sit on the ready up in the kitchen while we all ate. They offered to make her a new one.A woman came over and took it off her bill but the lack of apology for her not receiving her food was shocking. Honestly that's not what we were looking for, we wanted to see that they were apologetic for the slow service. I understand the concept of ordering at the bar. But to charge high end prices the concept doesn't blend. If I'm paying $65 for one drink (one shot of whiskey) a steak and some brussels sprouts somebody better be checking up on my food and ensuring that my meal was prepared well. I couldn't even express that my steak was over done because nobody gave me the opportunity to. I normally don't get bad reviews I'm an advocate for supporting, but they have seven out of town or's walk out of your restaurant extremely disappointed with the lack of service and quality of food for the prices we paid needed to be shared with management. Since we did not have a server I was forced to leave this review.",

I overheard one describe Aperol as being cherry flavored, and another, when describing a whiskey I was unfamiliar with told me that it was named based on the type of grain in it.  That seemed odd, so I looked it up and found out it was the name of the still used, not a grain.  I realize these things aren't the end of the world, and we're in Phoenix, not New York or San Francisco, but as a former service industry peon and eventual manager who stupidly described something she did not understand and has never forgotten the shame, I'm always in favor of better training. The space is cozy and welcoming - definitely worth checking out. And if you want to really wow a date this winter, take them ice skating and then pop in here for the o.g. lawless.  Third date material shiz right there.",

    "text": "I arrived at around 7 PM on a Saturday night and asked for a table for three. I was told by two nice hostesses that their tables were all reserved and booked until 8:15 ish, but that I could take my drinks and food to a seating area in the adjoining hotel. I just wanted to grab some light nosh and my friends who were meeting me were driving from the airport, straight off of a flight, and we had a concert to catch, so I decided to grab a seat at the bar instead.   I expected it to be difficult to find a seat at the bar but surprisingly, there was one open and available. I didn't have to wait for more than a few seconds before a menu was placed in front of me and a quick second later that I was given an extensive liquor list.  Service was prompt and expeditious and the bartenders were knowledgable and kind. I ordered the short rib sliders and shishito peppers, wanting to grab something that could be made quickly and that the bartender said the kitchen could whip up within minutes. And the appetizers were brought up from the kitchen within five or so minutes of ordering! I was shocked because of how quickly they were ready but the server reassured me that the dishes were fresh.  And the sliders were divine - perfect five bites of tender and large hunks of meat sandwiched between plump rolls. The horseradish sauce that was on the short rib wasn't overpowering, was piquant and nicely complimented the short rib.   The shishito peppers were delicious! Not too greasy (like other shishito peppers I've had) and was accompanied by a creamy Siracha dipping sauce and that was such a nice flavor thaf complimented the peppers but didn't take away from the flavor of the peppers.   I also had a delicious glass of their Laphroaig scotch and asked for it with a smidgen of water. I was served a small carafe of water to splash on top of the scotch. And it was divine! Their liquor menu is impressive and extensive - they carry a large selection of scotches from all over the world and whiskeys, both domestic and even the coveted Japanese whiskeys.   I will definitely be returning and next time, bringing my husband for a date. I can't wait to peruse their dinner menu and to try their selection of interesting dishes.",

It has several options for space of you wanted to talk as a group privately or at an open table.  We had several options that I posted pictures of but the stand outs were fried oysters and ahi tuna for staters. For entrees the Cajun style craw fish and rice the best dish around followed by the pork shank on a bed of risotto.  We had the compliment of two bottles of wine that was stellar, Justin obviously a favorite from our central coast of CA followed by the Malbec which was the stellar on their selection as well. The best part of why this place deserves 5 stars is their service and price point . Most stellar entrees are in the low to mid 20s and top shelf wine in the 60s . Such great value even though we didn't pay for dinner . Top notch and my kind of place for a professional meal in a more laid back setting",

It features a reasonably priced New American (tilted toward Southern) menu, with a selection of great entrees and an outstanding cocktail list.  There is a very cool bar, that is right off the adjoining Hotel Palomar.  We split a delicious chopped salad, that reminded us a lot of the chopped salad at Citizen Public House in Scottsdale.  Not sure if there is an ownership overlap or a bit of plagiarism, but in any case, it was yummy.  My wife had the shrimp and grits and I had the swordfish entree.  Both were prepared well and and delivered promptly by our server.  Once again, both high on the yummy scale!  For dessert we shared the cherry pie, which was every bit as tasty as a pie purchased at the legendary Rock Springs Cafe in Black Canyon City, and a lot closer to home, for most of us.  Parking in the garage next door was validated, making this a destination well worth the drive from the suburbs.  We certainly will be back!",

This place has a hip vibe, and was nicely packed at the time, the food menu was way different than I expected, but most of the items we ordered were SMASHING.  -Ribs fell off the bone, and tasted rich and actually mixed pretty damn well with blue cheese grits..who woulda thought that?   -Corn on the Cob, (mexican street style as my waiter said) were my favorite though, you gotta try this one time, the taste is explosive lol...   -Tater Tots- bomb-tastic, better than I've had in a minute, which is saying a lot. ha  Service was strange, but attentive. Not all in your face, which could be a good thing or bad thing for some people. Our waiter was chill though.   drinks wre str8, but not strong which was probably a good thing in my case, lol.

Very relaxed and ideal place for date, friends or chill \"unwind\" place w/coworker(s)!   Try the ceviche tacos - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. The Tots (Tater) are scrumptious also.  Also LOVE the fact that they have ability to make the Nat'l drink of Peru - the Pisco Sour.   My colleague and I were treated like royalty here - customer service blew me away. We had 2 separate servers (one for meal and other for drinks, etc), and they were so friendly and helpful. They both did frequent check-ins without being pesky flies. Unfortunately, I didn't catch their names. Our female server never batted an eye when I requested \"a side of olive brine for my STRONG dirty martini\". Made me feel nice inside. :)  Great job, Hound!",

You really have to know downtown Phx to get to the valet or public parking.    Once we got to the Palomar Hotel to the 2nd floor to the Blue Hound Kitchen it was very nice.  The ambience really has a cool vibe and a very urban feeling.  I checked out the website and the pictures do not do it justice.    We had drinks at the side bar and the waitress was very attentive to the point we had to tell her we are meeting another couple, we are going to chat THEN we will sit down at our table.  Granted it was restaurant week but it wasn't as busy as we thought it would be.  Anyhow, we finally sit and peruse the menu.  It looked amazing so we decide instead of ordering the set restaurant week menu we would order the appetizers and try them out.  They were intriguing to us.  We order a fabulous bottle of Petite Syrah for only $40 bucks.....  2 hours later we tried pretty much tried all the appetizers and they were delicious.  Great flavors, the corn appetizer you have to cut yourself off the cob.  Corn cutting of the cob skills needed!  It was fun and filling.  We did manage to order the beef short ribs and 3 out 4 thought they were fabulous.  Our 4th person thought it had way too much fat for what you are paying...30+.  He did think the flavor and taste was great!   Our waiter was pretty good.  He was attentive for certain things but we sat with empty and near empty water glasses for awhile. All in all it was a great experience...little things like the bar waitress being too attentive I guess makes up for our waiter not being as attentive with certain things.  Would I go here again?  Yes!",

We also had these fried meat balls with rice inside, atop a thick tomato sauce--this was possibly the best dish of the evening. For my entree, I ordered the Papardelle, which was good. Still, parpadelle noodles are to be wide, but, these were straight up lasagna noodles (????). My boyfriend ordered a steak and thoroughly enjoyed it, except for the potatoes which felt undercooked to him and bland. Some real hits here, but also needs some improvement",

Plus they were so nice about getting us a table even though we didn't have reservations. We had just planned for the team to meet up for drinks for a super casual work meeting, but it was too loud. Hey, it's a busy bar, it happens.  I just wish places like this would invest in the sound cancelling tech that I read about in Wired mag. Not dead quiet, just dialed down a bit.   OK, the food, amazing boudin balls, fried green maters and shrimp grits that rivaled the stuff I had on my last trip in the deep south.   It really seems to me that regional food is being done better outside its home turf. I noticed that in the Bay Area as well. I visit NYC for work frequently but have yet to find a better pastrami sandwich there, than the one (maybe seven), I had in San Carlos.   Very good cocktail menu here also. Love the creativity and balance. I had to stop at three because I hate to fly with a hangover but next time, Ill try more on the list.",

    "text": "After a so-so experience at a steakhouse the day before, I had higher hopes for this place. Once again I was with a group eating on someone else's dime, so price was no concern except as a way to judge value.   It's nestled in a corner of a high-rise surrounded by other anonymous corporate quarters. It aspires to be more than a place for suits to get lunch, however. The menu has signature cocktails, small plates and offbeat entrees that call out to foodies and hipsters, \"You're special, and we know it.\"  We had small plate/appetizers for the table, including roasted shishito peppers, cheese plate, deviled eggs and tater tots. I really liked the peppers and eggs, which had fried yolks as well as the usual whipped yolks. Cheese plate was a nice selection of good quality cheeses. Tots were just okay.  My entree was a braised beef short rib on grits. The presentation was a knockout, with a Flintstones size rib poking over the edge of the bowl with the grits at the bottom. Rib was evidently roasted to finish, giving it a little char flavor, and the texture was still a little toothy, not fall off the bone tender, which is better for a short rib I think.  Service was good but cool, as you should expect in a place like this. Overall a good experience, but I give it three rather than four stars because I think the prices are not in line with the cuisine. Maybe being in downtown means high rent, which forces them to charge like this, but I wouldn't pay those prices if it were my money.",

Service was sort of meh....we had the pork belly sliders for a starter-they were good but I didn't think they were the greatest.  I had the tucson chow da, it was good...but honestly it was mussels clams and two shrimp in a cream and pepper broth, the little fingerlings were good but seemed like an afterthought.    The drinks were good here, very good.  The Romeo and violette was different, could easily drink those by the pint.  Margaritas were some of the best around.     Suffered from mediocre service and an honestly not too memorable dining.  Good...but I don't think I'd go back for dinner.  Definitely would hit this place up for a drink or three.",

After persuasion we we're finally sat at a table near the bar that had been marked \"reserved\" along with three others in the row. We proceeded to order cocktails that we're delicious and then a light dinner which was also quite flavorful. The rest of the staff was very friendly and accommodating as a service industry professional should be. We sat in the booth for 40 minutes and had a $78 tab. Upon departure the booth next to us was still empty and the one on the other side was empty about half way through our visit and remained so till we departed. I am unsure the logic still to this moment she was instilling but I must say we chose after being soured by her lack of service to venture caddy corner to Bitter and Twisted where the hostess was lovely as well as welcoming! Maybe she should train the hostesses over at the Blue Hound! The bartenders were skilled, the waitress was perfect and the food was good and hot! I feel the experience was very dulled by it's initial interaction that one star is where I could rate, but that would not be fair to the rest of the establishments personnel that did do a great job!",

The new cocktail menu is ludacris! It has nice pictures of cocktails with numbers that lead you to a blurb that gives no description on what the drink is besides what city it was created in and by who. This sadly leaves you having a 20 minute discussion with your waiter/waitress on why and how this menu works and sadly enough they don't have all 40 some cocktails memorized so you get some diluted version of the ingredients with a lot of \"ummms\" and \"wellsssss\". Like most, I would assume we like to have some knowledge of what we are drinking rather than \"oh that looks nice in a picture and we call it Lion King and it's from Phoenix, created by a guy named Jake...I'm sure he's a great guy....\" I would assume that most of us go out looking to enjoy a nice cocktail and chat with our company not the wait staff who is  trying to depict a menu. This used to be our go to place for nice cocktails and food... It was also our go to place for our out of town guests. It is always the first place we have in mind to go. Blue hound has amazing food and cocktails. They just seem to be a little confused right now. Not sure if I will be going back until the cocktails are back in order. This is business suicide and Also!... Bring back the \"lawless\"! How do you take the best drink off a menu? Sad...",

    "text": "This place is a gem of a hotel lobby bar. I'm sure they hate being referred to as a lobby bar, but it is what it is. It's owned and operated by Kimpton, but with the atmosphere and offerings comparable to other successful gastro-lounges in the  Phoenix area, I think this place would also do well if it were a stand-alone operation. Come for a cocktail, or two, grab some 'gastropub tapas', and wash them down with another cocktail, or two.   Service at the bar can take longer than you'd like, but understandably so. The mixologists aren't just shelling out drinks, but rather, handcrafting cocktails that fire on all cylinders--presentation, taste, and price. I love the bourbon-heavy menu, with the Lawless and Old Belle being my go-to cocktails. Yea, they're up there in price, but Old Fashioneds are $6 on the HH menu Mon-Fri.  As stated in most reviews, the Kimchi Pork Belly Sliders are pretty bomb! Most of their bar menu items can be ordered in different sizes as to promote sharing and sampling of more menu items, a definite plus.   Unfortunately, I think the bartender told me the kitchen was closed when I was there on Sunday. I think I hit the lull between lunch and dinner service(3-5pm). It was definitely a bummer. Of course I don't know what your numbers look like, but I hope you have all the variables factored into your equations. I would've stayed and ordered another drink if I had food to go along with it. One drink alone would've covered an hour worth of kitchen labor. You should consider posting a sign that says,  \"We apologize to our patrons Sat-Sun 3-5pm, but our dreadful attempts at saving four hours of labor per week result in a disservice to our customers. We'd rather you eat and drink elsewhere.\"  All in all, 5 stars for the drinks and food (when I can get it). 1 star deducted for teasing me with a cocktail, and not pleasing me with food.",

    "text": "This was my second time to Blue Hound - and I am a fan.  First things first - it's a bit hard to find due to it being in the Palomar hotel. Just go to the Lobby of the Palomar (which isn't at street level FYI) and turn right. Voila. You are there.   This was the first time I have been here for dinner, the other was for lunch. So I waited for my friend at the bar. So, for it being a pretty small bar - and I was sitting at it - it took a long time for a bar tender to come and ask what I wanted. In fact, it wasn't until my friend got there that they even asked. I would rate the bar service not so great. Another instance of trying to do side work, and not paying attention to who is at the bar. And, then we ordered two simple drinks - a glass of chardonnay and a tanqueray rocks, and that even took some serious time to get.  For starters - I would definitely recommend them. Deviled eggs are awesome, although fundamentally a little odd to get at a restaurant and not a backyard bbq. Fried green tomatoes are delish and definitely try the short rib sliders. My only issue with the short rib sliders is I am not such a fan of the sweet rolls, but the meat is awesome.  For dinner, I think I am a little hung up here. I can't say I loved the stuffed chicken. (Does not appear to be on the menu anymore.) Turned out a bit dry for me. But the accompaniments were great - cauliflower, veggies, etc.   Overall, it's a neat place. I like the setting, I am just not sure of the food. Appears to be a southern twist - so I am thrown off by the trout, shrimp, etc., as they just aren't my thing. But I think it's a good place to go for a drink and some apps.",

My siblings and I took my Dad here for Father's Day.  Surprisingly, it was packed (not with Father's Day peeps but rather a ton of folks in town for various conventions).  The restaurant matches well with the feel of the Hotel Palomar in general.  Modern and eclectic.  As for the food?  They strongly encourage sharing dishes amongst the whole table so they offer have and full portions of all their dishes.  For vegetarians, they have a farm fresh menu of various veggie combo dishes.  For the appetizer, we got a full order of tater tots (yes, tater tots).  Decent flavor, a little oily.  For the main dish my Dad and I both got the short rib (which is huge by the way), while my bro got the fried quail, and my sis got the gizpacho.  The short rib was juicy, fall off the bone tender with a perfect char.  My brother's quail was pretty good, but we unfortunately discovered some bones still embedded in the quail.  Not sure if it was supposed to be that way, but it was an unpleasant surprise from an otherwise tasty dish.  My sister said the gizpacho was so-so.  Overall, the food was good but not great as some dishes probably still need some work.  The atmosphere of the place and the friendly wait staff made up for some of this place's shortcomings and they even comped the appetizer for sitting us in a noisy area with the convention goers.  They didn't have to do that, but it was a nice gesture.  As a whole, I would absolutely bring my friends here for happy hour as they have a really cool bar area with a decent cocktail selection and the modern look of the place is a great conversation piece.  As far as the restaurant itself, I think it has potential.  Its only been open two weeks and I know every new place goes through some growing pains, so I'm willing to give them a pass on some of menu misfires for now.  Hopefully next time I come by they'll have worked out the kinks and lived up to their potential.",

    "text": "Holiday Rip-off at Blue Hound: most pathetic holiday buffet ever. My husband and I were looking for a Christmas Day restaurant option, as it was going to be just the two of us (why cook?) but it's also his birthday. Yup, Xmas baby. So when I saw that Blue Hound had a Christmas breakfast buffet, I was excited, as the place has been on my \"must try\" list since we moved to PHX a couple of years ago. What a disappointment. Bigly.  Now, $36 for a holiday buffet isn't bad at all, and as it was a breakfast/brunch offering, we didn't expect the moon. When we walked in and saw the meager layout, I wanted to leave, but my husband was hungry, and there are not many options on Christmas. I figured, the food will be really good, per their rep, so we'll stay.  The scrambled eggs were like a yellow sponge from sitting over the heat. No seasonings, no add-ins, just plain ol' eggs. Next up, the breakfast sausage links were cold and gray; they didn't even bother to grill them. Nuked or steamed, they were unappetizing to say the least. Now, the applewood bacon was quite good; I ended up chowing a lot of it because I was starving - hadn't eaten anything that morning - and everything else was so lame. The third treat was shriveled, plain potato wedges. Again, no discernible seasonings, and apparently no one in the kitchen could find any onions, bell peppers or mushrooms - anything - to jazz them up a bit. And barely lukewarm.  No waffles, no pancakes. Every crummy hotel chain has a Belgian waffle maker, but even that was too much to hope for here.  The tray of pastries looked pretty sad, but I was desperate. Yuck. The Danish were stone-cold, wet and heavy. The bear claws, dry and heavy. Supposedly there had been muffins at some point, the waitress said. The bagels were standard supermarket issue, i.e., basically donut-shaped bread. Oh joy, they had some smoked salmon. How festive.  The big finale were parfaits, about 1/3 cup each, with sour, out-of-season berries and a fruit tray dominated by melons and strawberries: they look great, but are tasteless this time of year. Finished up with watery coffee.   At least our waitress was good. Still, I was even more irked to see that a 20% gratuity was tacked on the bill. For a party of two. Really?  Grand total for all this holiday cheer: $92.52. My husband didn't want to complain, so I let it go while we were there, but on Monday, I was still annoyed that they'd wrecked our holiday/birthday brunch. I left a message for the manager on the restaurant voicemail, and of course, silence.  No response IS a response. Like the buffet, it means \"fa la la la la you.\"",

    "text": "It's always a treat to visit Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails, whether you're feasting on innovative creations by Chef Stephen Jones, who pours love into every dish, or sipping on one of the delicious handcrafted cocktails for happy hour. I was invited to try some of the newest offerings on Jones' current spring/summer menu, made with organic and locally sourced ingredients that perfectly complement each other for a symphony in your mouth.  This meal (thank you to J. Lauren PR for the invitation), my pal Elle and I grabbed a seat outside on the patio, overlooking CityScape in downtown Phoenix.  Not only was the weather perfect, we could hear tunes from neighboring Copper Blues. Like Elle pointed out, the music was great because it provided great background melodies that allowed us to still hear what each other was saying.  Like all my visits at Blue Hound, the service, from the hostess to every single server who visited our table (including the knowledgeable and friendly Justis), was top-notch. Kudos to Blue Hound for properly training their staff in menu proficiency and professionalism.  We started with two delicious drinks - the Singapore Sling ($10) was made with Arizona Distilling Co. gin, Benedictine, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and Cherry Heering liqueur. Justis told us the drink is modeled after original Tiki drinks, and we both agreed the balance of sweet and sour was great  I also got the Lost Melody ($10), a frothy concoction with Smirnoff vodka, grapefruit liquer, coconut cream, grapefruit juice, and rose flower water. It tasted like dessert in a drink, which was totally fine with me, and I loved inhaling the coconut scents with every tasty sip.  My pal and I split a ton of plates, perfectly portioned for sharing, during our feast. First up was the Cured Strawberry and Fennel Flatbread ($14), with pickeled fennel (a favorite ingredient of Chef Jones - read my Phoenix People interview with him here), pistachio, wild baby arugula and ricotta cheese. I've never had strawberries on a pizza, but let me tell you, the flatbread was delicious and tasted just like what you'd think of when it comes to spring.  We also dug into the Avocado salad ($9), with blood oranges, grapefruit and wild greens. Elle described it perfectly as \"chic diet food,'\" a light and fresh salad you could feel good eating right before a night out or before getting into a swimsuit, since it was healthy and light. I loved the fruit and avocado combination and gobbled up every bite.  Elle loved the Tater Tots she ordered (a small portion at $7), which had bacon and chive made right in the tots. \"These are every college kid's wet dream,\" she said, noting the bacon baked in was a spectacular touch.  We both enjoyed the Corn Bread Panzanella ($9), a bread salad with artichoke, fava beans, baby leeks, and peas mixed with an herb vinaigrette. It was really filing and would be a great appetizer to share.  Surprisingly, maybe our favorite savory dish was the Roasted Cauliflower ($9), really simple but oh-so-good because, like most of Blue Hound's offerings, it combined sweet, savory and salty to satisfy all your palate's tastes. It came with pistachios, capers and currants, and Justis said it's simply cooked by poaching the cruciferous vegetable in milk before charring it a little in a skillet, then adding in the capers, currants and a touch of butter and herbs.  Elle summed up the meal perfectly: \"I would never have thought of putting this stuff together, but it's exactly what I want,\" she said.  I was full, but we asked Justis to surprise us with dessert. He brought out the latest dessert menu item, the BHPB&J ($9), a twist on PB&J with whoopie pie, blackberry jelly ice cream, peanut butter mousse (OMG, so good), and fresh berries. The chocolate covering the whooiee pie was so decadent, and I loved all the flavors on the updated classic. \"It tastes like the Fourth of July,\" Elle added, saying it reminded her of all-American flavors from the summer holiday.  We were stuffed, but then were surprised with dessert number two: Pineapple Upside-Down Cake served skillet-style ($9), wish medjool date ice cream atop salted caramel.  We devoured every bite despite our full bellies, and every serving was a winner for these two ladies.  While most of what we ordered was vegetarian, Blue Hound's latest menu has some notable seafood items, including Crispy Salt N' Pepper Shrimp, Grilled Yellowfin Tuna and Red Snapper.",

    "text": "My wife and I came here for our 26th anniversary dinner, while stating at the hotel, and the experience the staff of Blue Hound provided ranked this dinner among the top three of my life! Through out the staff at Blue Hound was attentive and professional, but also gave us our space. We were seated against a window with views of Phoenix skyline and the old court building, On our table was a card congratulating us on our anniversary signed by several people on the staff (one wishing us Happy Birthday - my wife's favorite).  We started with cocktails and at the waiter's suggestion I had a Lawless (Bourbon, homemade bitters and liqueur and served in a glass that was presented upside down over smoldering tobacco smoke). It was sweeter than I expected but very balanced. My wife enjoyed the Romeo & Violette, choosing only based on the name of the drink. Her drink was not as sweet as I expected but similarly balanced.  For dinner we both had the Chef and Bar Geek out for $48.00 each. This was four courses, of which three were served with cocktails and none were on the menu. The manager, mixologist, sous chef, and chef each visited our table several times. They started by asking for preferences and allergies (non) and then explained each cocktail and course.   The first course did not have a cocktail and was a cod served with olive oil, fennel and other ingredients the four cocktails now have me forgetting. The dish was mild with tangs from the fennel and spices. I remember thinking that I'd never have order this on a menu based on the description (I need to broaden my horizons), but it was amazing!  The second course came out after we were presented with a watermelon flavored and vodka based cocktail served with the foam of egg whites on top. We were guessing what the course might be based on the drink, but didn't come close. The second course was soft shelled crab on a bed of local sweet corn. We had never had soft shelled crab before so the waiter explained that we did not need to remove the shell, but could just enjoy it all. I enjoy crab, so I'm not sure why I've never had soft shelled crab. All together it was delicious again and also something I'd never have considered reading on a menu.   The third course came out after we were presented with a cocktail based on the house mulled wine topped with egg whites. It was a heavy and spicy drink (and amazing) so we were predicting beef or pork for the next course. The third course was pork belly topped by a poached egg and served on a chorizo aioli with Mexican spiced corn cut off the cob and a Blue Hound tater tot. I  was glad to see the tater tot, having read about Blue Hound's tater tots here, but my wife never would have ordered it. . In fact, it is here where I am relying on pictures and the third cocktail makes it a little fuzzy. Just the same, it was also amazing and we were stuffed at the end (yeah, we could have stopped and not eaten it all, but that was neigh impossible).   Prior the fourth course we were presented with an espresso-based cold cocktail that had us guessing chocolate. The desert came after we had had time to let the prior three courses settle over conversation; not so soon as to rush us but not so late as to have us looking for the waiter. Desert was the only course where we received different dishes. I was given a pineapple upside down cake under medjool ice cream with salted carmel sauce (this was the only item of the evening that I later saw on the menu). My wife was given some sort of flour-less chocolate cake with a salted carmel sauce and ... well, I forget the rest. The pineapple upside down cake was just so good. She ate half of my desert and we both had far more than we should have. We both liked her desert, but the pineapple upside-down cake with the carmel and ice cream what just right.   The dinner came in under $200 for the two of us including tip. To be honest, I'd expected it to cost far more and, considering the quantity and quality of food and service we received, the price was a bargain. Blue Hound will definitely have us looking for excuses to come downtown again. I was happy we were staying at the Palomar so the right \"home\" was just an elevator ride. To do even just the three cocktails (ha! even just!) that came with the \"geek out\" experience I would definitely need a taxi or designated driver home. Thankfully the Hotel Palomar has fantastic summer rates and a room was less than the price of a car or taxi.",

    "text": "The experience started off well enough, but it then became really frustrating. I enjoyed a happy hour drink with a snack, tasty, at the bar and had a nice positive, service experience. The staff at the bar had expanded when I decided that I was too tired to head elsewhere for a full meal. My new server became a serious downer. After being ignored for a while, I grabbed his attention and asked about specials for the evening. There were none, but for any other server, that question would have been an indicator that this particular customer was highly serious about ordering dinner. No, apparently not.   This guy went around and paid attentive service to every male at the bar, getting drinks, following up with proactive questions about whether they would like to order dinner, asking how their, insert food/drink here, were. Unlike me, these people were not clutching their menus. The bartender closed them out while I sat. It was unbelievable. All the while, I'm there with the darn menu, giving the look, and hoping to order.   After the various male patrons left for their dinners elsewhere or finished their drinks, he turned to me. I ordered some dinner. I was furious. The ONLY reason I stayed was that I had had a busy day and hadn't had a chance to eat lunch. I was really hungry. Going elsewhere would have taken too long. By the time my food arrived, and the, more with it bartender, asked the obligatory questions, all I could offer were clipped responses while thinking, \"get me out of here. I deserve better.\" I choked down the meal, paid, and left.   Here's what I'll say. Women travel. Women need to eat. Women sit at the bar to do those things, eat, drink, and relax, like any other travelers. Don't make us second class citizens.  My experience might have been due to one server's unconscious bias, but it sucked and it colored an otherwise positive experience.",

There was a long table between us and the bar where a 40 y/o was celebrating her birthday. It would have been nicer if they were in the corner of the room instead of the center as they were quite loud.  The birthday girl was very loud every time she opened a present. I guess some people just need attention. Ok, back to the review, our food was delicious and our server Adam D. was great. It would have been better if we were able to hear each other at our table instead of being drowned out by the party.",

Our waitress was a bit rude and cut us off when we were speaking to her. Her attitude really overshadowed the experience we were anticipating. The pasta portions were small, and even smaller when you saw how much you were paying for it. The drinks were delicious. I got the Buffalo Dusk drink and would definitely get it again. Nothing \"wowed\" me out of the food we purchased except for the chocolate dessert. We purchased a few appetizers and split them but nothing really stood out to me. The two that are pictured are the Roasted Cauliflower and the Spiced Chicharrones. The atmosphere was the most impressive thing out of the restaurant.",

    "text": "Phoenix, you \"speak-easy\" our language! This was our second and final \"sip and nosh\" place for the evening. I knew I wanted to try this place out so I purposely told hubby to save room for our next small plate dinner. I couldn't quite tell from the photos what kind of food it offered but figured we would find something to fill our bellies.   Let me start off by saying the name (Blue Hound Kitchen) doesn't do justice to its classy, posh, swanky, speakeasy like, cozy bar/restaurant. I mean, yeah I applaud the Blue Hounds which greet patrons here and there (pictures are a must!) but the place is so much more than that!  Lucky for us, it was a Sunday night and we had no problems walking (I mean sauntering) in to a nearly open seat bar. I can imagine on a weeknight it would be packed with the downtowners loosening the tie and tossing back some cocktails after work.   We truly enjoy watching our bartenders work their magic while crafting cocktails. Hubby enjoyed the Lawless cocktail ($13) finished off with a tobacco smoke. I opted for the Air Mail ($12) which was light and refreshing. As I gazed over the menu, I immediately spied the Corn Grit Fries (how can anyone resist smoked bacon, white cheddar and Pomodoro sauce) and hubby picked the Deviled Eggs. I must have been hiding under a rock when deviled eggs became a huge appetizer. Even though we just had them at our last restaurant, they never taste the same no matter where you go! These were good but not raving over them. Those Grit Fries are what we raved over. So interesting and awesome. Definitely recommend!  We left happy and blue. Happy, we had a great time but a bit blue that our time in Phoenix was too short. Definitely would like to explore more of this place (and city) next time we're here! It's no joke that Phoenix is HOT, HOT, HOT...temperature and dining/bar scene!",

I had some kind of Rose infused gin drink, I can't find the name of it, but it was fantastic. All of the drinks from the menu sounded wonderful, I can't wait to try more.   For dinner I had Roast Chicken with veggies. The skin on the chicken was so crispy I LOVE crispy chicken skin. My date had the fried catfish. Definitely recommend both.   The only thing is I wish bread was included with the meal! It was $12 off the appetizer menu, and I couldn't get myself to splurge for it. I also wish the dessert menu was a little bit more variable. I was in the mood for dessert, but none of them were doing it for me unfortunately.   But would love to come back! It's a great experience overall!",

We started with drinks, great drink menu, very creative. For appetizers we had the flatbread which was just okay and the fried polenta (you can definitely do without this)....the entrees were AMAZING. We tried a little of everything. Pork shank, Brussel sprouts, salmon, rainbow trout, fried green tomatoes & the shrimp and grits!  My favorite was the Brussels and the rainbow trout. We also tried the pineapple upside down cake, HOW IS IT SO DELICIOUS.   Great service too. Come here, tell your friends about it.",

Their cocktails were delicious and we each ended up ordering two and sharing because we liked everyone else's drinks too. My MIL and I both got the shrimp and grits and let me tell you, it satisfied every comfort food bone in my body. It was delicious.  The FIL and my husband both got the pork shank? And both thought it was good, but they like us girls' shrimp and grits more;) there was just a lot of rice and was a little dry.   And the appetizers! Almost forgot those. We got the ahi tuna thing, and it was so good. But in my opinion it wasn't the tuna that was the star of this dish, it was the fried chickpeas they had on the side.  Holy moly- I need that recipe.   Anyway- totally recommend this place",

We had the flatbread special of the day with green chiles and pulled pork. Very good. And the chicken bites were fantastic.  Also shared the burrata and it was great.

Entrance to Blue Hound is that way.    OK cool.   Go that way.   Met up with a hostess, we said who we were meeting, nope, not here, you want to walk all the way down to the blue stairs.     Okay, cool.   So we go past the first doors with the sign and could not find any blue stairs.   Go back to the original hostess station,  give the party name, she says oh yes and takes us back to the blue stair girl.  Who seemed VERY confused the first time.   This new hostess says this girl will help you.  No, no she won't she sent me to some fictional blue stairs.   What is your party again?   I say it again.   Nope.  Whip out my phone to call my friends just as hostess number two says \"ohhhhhhh xxxx\"  YES.  The SAME NAME I HAVE BEEN saying.   So takes me to our friends.    Yeesh.    Which by the way was not in the back where it says the entrance is.  They were RIGHT NEXT to the original hostess station.        OK cool!   Let's get drinks.  Guy comes and says that they aren't serving tables, you have to go to the bar.  Ok, cool.   VERY OVER PRICED for very little alcohol.   Very few mixers, no redbull for instance.    Ordered food, ham sandwich and 4 shrimp.   VERY OVER PRICED for very little food.     NO service at our table, had to hunt the check down.   THEN the confused hostess tried to tell us there was a 200.00 table minimum.     Blue Hound you suck.  Out loud.  Thanks for putting everyone in a bad mood before a comedy show.  NEVER AGAIN.",

I went there before a concert to get drinks and a few small snacks. The first thing I ordered was the beef carpaccio. This is one of my favorite dishes to order whenever I see it on the menu. When it arrived it was one tiny tiny piece of meat with a few super thin chips and one bite of arugula salad. An absolute rip off. We also ordered some bread which came with 3 tiny pieces and a horrible sauce on the plate.  The drinks ($15.00 a piece) were tasteless and watered down. I don't know what happened to this place but I will not be going back. The only reason for 2 starts is because the server was so nice.",

The location is downtown and close to the Comerica Theater which is where we were going after dinner.   I had the iceberg salad which was very good.  For the entree I had the Arctic Char which was good but not great.  From watching the surrounding tables, it appeared that the happy hour appetizers might have been the way to go.  They have outdoor seating with a fireplace which would be nice when the weather is cooler.  It's convenient in the downtown area but not particularly special.",

The restaurant was only about 2/3 full but it was very loud and the atmosphere was a mix of people like us dressed casually and people dolled up.  By the time we left, however, it was pretty empty.    We had a bit of a hard time ordering, and the weird thing was the huge variance in the portion sizes.  For four of us we ordered the bottomless popcorn, the large BBQ'd Kobe beef short rib, the tater tots, Dinasaur kale salad, roasted cauliflower, a special flatbred, the large jerk cured fish.  We also had a heirlooms tomato salad that the waiter gave us because someone had messed up an order.  Everything was actually really tasty, but the beef short ribs dominated the meal in terms of portion size while the tater tots and the fish were really tiny in size.  Food came out at a pace that wasn't rushed and allowed us to talk and enjoy ourselves.  My only other complaint was that there were a large number of things that they were out of (both on the bar menu and the food menu).  I'd definitely come back here, but I'd really rather someone else paid.",

The lighting is dim and orange, offered up primarily from vintage-style Edison bulbs hung from the ceiling. Sure enough, you're met by the statue of a blue hound upon entering.  Blue Hound was busy when we arrived at around 10:00p, but we were able to find seats at the bar. Turns out, this was the best place for us to sit.  We were helped by a super competent bartender named Bobby. It was very obvious that he loved what he was doing. The drink options were super crafty and Bobby was especially knowledgable about every topic we discussed with him.  We didn't order any food, but I would love to go back and experience their food menu sometime soon.  The drinks were costly, but you definitely get what you pay for - both in quality of beverage and in quality of service. In fact, the cocktails in particular were VERY reasonably priced for the quality of what you got.  I enjoyed my time at Blue Hound - I'll definitely be back. If you haven't been, get yourself a little dressed up and go give it a shot - you won't be disappointed. Well done, Blue Hound! And thanks, Bobby, for a really nice time.  :)",

We decided to try the Brioche French Toast & Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Both were tasty and portions were just right. & Coffee was delish! Service was outstanding. I look forward to an evening Dinner here. Oh my...their Happy Hour fries would be ideal right about now! Cheers***",

We planned to have a nice night out again and eat some of the traditional plates we had but they changed the menu and sadly disappointed in the portion sizes, lack of creativity and flavor of and in the food.   To begin the deviled eggs were nothing compared to the ones at Del Friscos. Lacked flavor and taste. My wife had the Swordfish which was good, and I had the Neiman Short Ribs - bad decision - it was mainly thin flat meat with fat and tasted bathed in salt.  When I told the waiter he looked at me as though I didn't know meat had salt and said they were \"salt friendly\" as though I would have changed my mind.  The manager walked over shortly after and asked how the sharing of our first dish was going instead of apologizing and asking if there was anything they could do to make the experience better.   When the next dish was brought out, Trout, it too tasted over salted but as I was too hungry I ate it and just wanted to call it a night.   I WILL NEVER GO BACK!",

A friend who ordered the same dish had to dip his sliders in BBQ sauce.

And over 35 years in the industry.  I called to inquire about the brunch the day before  I was told their would be a waffle station  along with many other items  the cost was at 37 dollars per person. $$$$$ I thought this to be reasonable  as it was Christmas morning. Our reservation was for 11:15 AM   we arrived on time. The  employees were pleasant.  The restaurant  was for the most part empty.  We walked over to the buffet  the items included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and fried potatoes, cold smoked salmon, bagels, Danish, and sliced assorted fruit,  a hot continental breakfast at best. Their was no waffle station  no omelette station as I was told there would be when I called the restaurant the day before. No lunch items at all   so I could not understand why they billed this as a brunch when it should have been billed as just a breakfast//  Needless to say that for over $120 dollars for a party of three,  we were quite disappointed.",

Look forward to trying other dishes when I find myself back in Arizona...    I was moved to write this review because when I reached out to the Blue Hound Kitchen to receive a copy of my receipt, the Kimpton ... Taylor Case, Restaurant Ambassador ... to be specific, not only responded to me in a timely manner, but also attached a copy of the receipt to the email.  Very much appreciated and matched what I have experienced at other Kimptons and my time dining at Blue Hound Kitchen.  So if you visit Phoenix, check both places out ... Blue Hound and the Kimpton!",

The oysters were like silk from the sea.   Cocktails were stellar: bartender selected The Lawless for me, and I've never enjoyed one more.   Bonus: an amazing birthday dessert and the staff signed a birthday card for me.   I'm not from Arizona but on my next visit you'll find me sipping on The Lawless at the Blue Hound.",

They changed up their deviled eggs and while they were good, they weren't as good as they once were.   The drinks were serviceable but some of the other appetizers weren't what was expected. Though they were happy hour prices the portion sizes weren't what was expected.  The bartender was nice enough and fairly engaging but she was at the end of her shift and seemed a bit distracted as she was setting up for the next guy.  We'll be back... it's good enough to visit for another round of drinks... but we'll probably end up making it one of the stops of the night vs. the place we end up at for an extended period of time.",

I have been to Blue Hound a couple of times for happy hour and have not been disappointed. I was definitely not disappointed for dessert.   I had the \"Lost Melody\" cocktail which I have enjoyed on a previous visit. Made with pisco, coconut cream, rose flower water and a couple of other ingredients. Delicious.   For dessert I had the chocolate pudding. Served in a jar with layers of graham crackers, chocolate pudding and marshmallow fluff. Vanilla ice cream and peanuts are served on the side. Oh so good!   If you are just going for cocktails, snacks or desserts, sit in the lounge right off the lobby. Great for people watching!   Enjoy!",

He's kinda old school and simple and trendy food isn't really his thing. But he gave it two thumbs up and 5 stars!  He and my mother both got the chicken dish. I was able to steal a bite and I know what I'm getting next time now!  My sister and I shared the melt in your mouth steak entree. And also shared a few small plates.  I could of done without the fried green tomatoes. They were just kinda plain and the crab was fishy.  We also shared the Brussel sprouts. A must! Even tho our bowl was mostly pork belly and very few Brussels, but seems like a tough thing to complain about.  I will definitely be returning.  Ambience is rustic and trendy. Kind of loud.

Blue Hound's American fare was great food and Great ambiance mixed into one.   Got there at 700pm and front desk gal said it would be 5 minutes. It was 15 minutes later and no reasoning why a bit later, but hey it's New Years so I just carried on through with a smile.   Ambiance is superb with bar seating, nice bar and seating deeper inside that had nice window views of downtown Phoenix. There were also picnic table seating outside but it's way too cold for that on Jan 1st !   I wanted something light so I got the handmade pasta with marinara , parm, basil , garlic and onions. The noodles were like angel hair and can totally tell they were house made. Sauce was pretty good though it tasted more on the ketchup side than the marinara side. Overall it was nice presentable dish with great noodles and overall great flavors.  Would I get it again ? Probably not.   Menu is fairly small , but it makes picking something easier.  Guy next to me said his meal was \"average.\" I felt the same way ...it was good but not something to talk about. The ambiance made up for it.   If you are in the area looking for a fancy good plate and great ambiance , come check it out!",

Made a reservation online the night before, they had an issue finding it and hassled me a little bit until they did.  Here's the jist: this place is really overpriced for the below average quality of food, drink and service you get.  We ordered 2 starters, steak and several sides to share. Also got several cocktails.  The food is bland, tastes like it was heated in a microwave and the steak was not worth the $35 price tag.  The Mac and Cheese was dry and chalky tasting. I ordered a dirty martini and there was no dirt to it. Asked for a side of olive juice to add to it, and they brought me about a teaspoons worth of it.  Cheap!  The arm on my wooden chair was actually falling off and we had to keep asking for water refills.  Save yourself the coin and go somewhere where you get your money's worth.",

We were unsure of where to park, but we were pleasantly surprised that the parking garage elevator took us right to this place !     I LOVED the atmosphere --comfy booths, wood and metal--I felt sheik.   I was a little worried about being underdressed but everyone else had jeans on too.     The food was the best part!!    Amazing burger--juicy and flavorful---accompanied the hand cut crispy fries.   I tried the Hound Beer and it went perfectly with the burger.   My spouse had the fish tacos and he claims they are the best he has ever had!   Big chunks of white fish filled a bowl and he was able to create his own tacos with cabbage salsa and guacamole.   I didn't love the wait staff.    The place was nearly empty and they claimed that there was only one table not reserved.     None of the reservations showed by the time we left.   I almost felt that I was bothering them by being there.   Overall this is a place to try--especially on days you are looking for a a classic burger and beer.",

The menu changed, the ambiance, the bar, the crowd...the kitchen, the servers. The food was ok but not much more than that. The bar scene:  no more happy hour (we were not looking for that, however, the place was quite empty for a Friday night before a Suns game) After our cocktails  (not best bartender of any year worthy)...then ordering dinner from the full menu as we always have done, I then wanted a glass of pinot with dinner,  and my only option was Belle Glos at $22 a glass..the one and only option for a pinot...I passed on the wine (out of principle)  my significant other then ordered an IPA...they were out of IPA and comped him a can of beer...Really? Enough said, we are home now and writing this while having my Belle Glos at home. Best of Luck to You in 2019..you will need it.",

I had a flatbread with olives, grapes, peppers and feta for my main course (which I enjoyed so much that I tried to replicate it once I flew back home) and hubby had the pork belly, which came in a cast-iron dish. We were so full that we skipped dessert, but the menu looked promising.  Service was attentive and pleasant and I really enjoyed the modern, pub-like atmosphere.",

The first thing I noticed was this cute coffee table in the lobby area. We sat there and enjoyed some really tasty water, yes water. So good!  Our friends arrived and we moved on to our reserved table. The server was really nice and very helpful with our orders. We had the Mini Harris Ranch Patty Melt ($10.00 small order) they were really good! I drank beer, it was a little warm for my liking. I like ice cold beer, but that's okay. Since we had a medium size group we sampled each others mixed drinks. I really enjoyed every single one of those drinks, they ranged from a really smooth relaxing drink to some with a little more kick. All had just the right amount of alcohol, so you weren't over powered by alcohol. I glanced over to the kitchen and was pleased to see a really clean kitchen area. The chefs looked like they really enjoyed their work. At the end of our evening we were so pleasantly surprised that our birthday girl was given a Pineapple Upside down cake with a lit candle on it, and a birthday card signed by all the chefs and servers. That was such a sweet touch. We will definitely be back here again.  Thumbs up guys, great work!",

We split it because we were told the portions were big. They are plenty big, but we didn't even finish it because it lacked  flavor. Neither one of us cared for it. The kids wanted corn dogs and when they were eating them we discovered that they were not fully cooked. The batter was raw all around the corn dogs. My friend and I also ordered bloody Mary's. I had 3 small sips and could not even choke any more down. It only came garnished with a lime wedge, and the flavor made me feel a little nauseous. My friend thinks there was a lot of garlic in it.......we did complain about the corn dogs and they apologized and took it off our bill and offered us free desert. We did not take them up on it, we just decided we would call it quits. Would not recommend this place.",

I liked the menu and location so decided to try as the ratings were good. I was beyond impressed. I have eaten all over the world and in extremely nice restaurants but Blue Hound Kitchen's service was out-of-this-world. I had booked the reservations for 5 through opentable and made a little note about the birthday. They called to confirm and when I spoke about the birthday and dessert possibilities she was very accomodating. I had mentioned also my friend was gluten and dairy free. Upon arriving the staff had not only pulled a menu and highlighted the items upon it that were gluten and dairy free for her but then also had placed a birthday card signed by the entire staff on top! They referred to her by name and really made the whole dinner seem so special! It was almost like dining with family! I was so impressed with this service and cannot even begin to thank them enough for making it such a special evening! If you have special occassions this is the place to celebrate it. The food was fun and tasty (I'm sure most of the other reviews below go into detail on that). It's right across the street from Stand Up Live also so being able to make it a full evening out is also handy. I will definitely be visiting this place again!",

Any parking was confusing but we ended up there and were glad we did.  Atmosphere was definitely the chic industrial trendy gatro pub thing. Service was great and food was fantastic. My hubby and I both got whisky inspired cocktails off their house cocktail list and were quite impressed.  My husband made a \"joke\" about the cornichon on his burger asking what they do to make them so small and the server handled his bad joke very well.  We frequently traverse through Phoenix and Scottsdale so we will be back!  If your in the area walking around, look this place up and treat yourself to some new flavors both in the food and drinks!

The BBQ ribs are the best I have ever tasted. So tender it does just fall off the bone. The fries were a nice side and rounded off the meal very well. In short everything we ordered was great!

This restaurant was above and beyond what I'd hoped for, and totally made the night.   Our waitress was Shaura, and was totally sweet. She was super knowledgable of the menu and drinks menu. The atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for; a little modern, a little urban, and a little rustic, all in one. It's located in the Hotel Palomar's lobby, and a bit difficult to find, but doesn't affect the restaurant's awesomeness.   For an appetizer we had the Tater Tots (DO IT), and I ended up using the sauce to dip everything else in later.. an amazing blend of european spices and tomatoes and peppers. Awesome.   My boyfriend had the Pork in Belly. Sounds weird, but he downed the entire thing. AND had dessert. But more on that later. It was super tender and I could smell its deliciousness from across the table. I had the Heirloom Prosciutto, which was REALLY good. Heirloom Prosciutto, I learned, is really rare, and was most likely the best I've ever had. It had pesto and pistachio, which made it super unique.   Shaura helped me plan a special birthday surprise dessert for my man, and the entire staff even signed a birthday card for him! The dessert might have been the best part, It was toffee cake with BACON ice cream and carmel on top. Yes, BACON ice cream.   We will definitely be back.",

Pork shank was good but didn't blow me away, my colleague appeared to really like the shrimp and grits. The brussels sprouts on the salad menu were a great side and delicious. The chocolate pudding with marshmallow fluff was amazing. It had a graham cracker crust. The waitress was also excellent. Very happy, highly recommended.",

The English Mule is refreshing and a nice twist on the Moscow Mule. We ate outside on the patio and had a great experience. Dessert was the chocolate cake with in house banana ice cream and caramel. One of my colleagues had lunch there and said the bourbon/scotch menu and associated drinks are impressive.",

We decided upon this restaurant based on the good reviews. Many times I hate asking bartenders for a drink recommendation because they more worried on how fast they can make the drinks. While we where there we were recommended the metropolitan by Michael, which was delicious! I would recommend this drink. Through out the night we also had another bartender Rob that was also very attentive. If you want a place to relax and enjoy yourself I would suggest going on a night when Michael and/Rob are working! Had a blast!",

And the bartender who suggested it was neither pompous nor pretentious.   This is the type of bar I would go to in New York City on a daily basis, but not tell anyone about because it's that good. I don't really want anyone to actually come here,  thus making it too busy to enjoy.   The drink menu is extensive and changes seasonally. Almost every cocktail is $10, which is insanely inexpensive considering the craft and talent and quality they are made with.   They also offer food late night, I think the comestibles are available until 1am?   The decor of this place is so perfect it's ridiculous. It plays off Hotel Palomar perfectly with a little bit of a ranch style with mod touches and who knows what else. It's impossible to describe and impossible not to fall in love with.   Why am I not here right now?",

    "text": "Preface: I'd give this place 2.5 stars if that was an option.   I met the girls for happy hour. I didn't feel like a fussy house cocktail so I ordered my standard gin & soda. Too bad they had no specials for this very basic drink ($8, I think for a single). So I ended up paying a lot more than others with their whiskey lemonades or whatever-the-heck they ordered.   After seeing the array of HH dishes ordered by others, I settled on the Kennebac Potato Fries and Hickman Farms Deviled Eggs. Both were tasty, indulgent snacks. I loved the rosemary on the fries and the generousness of the yolk mixture in the eggs (fork and knife were essential for me and my clumsiness).   The sliders got good reviews as well, though I didn't try them.   Decor was enjoyable. Service could have been better, but we were sitting in the lounge area so maybe they weren't as focused on us (however, it is happy hour in a hotel...I'd think they'd be paying attention, especially during this peak time).  All and all--an okay experience, but I know I am not going out of my way to return--especially as a local. The happy hour just isn't that great of a deal (and I wish they had more food options! Not a great selection and the dinner entrees are $20+). The inconvenience of parking downtown and so-so service just adds to my Blue Hound apathy. I guess if you are downtown it's a fine option.",

    "text": "We came to take advantage of a promotion of $35pp for 3 courses. Due to construction we opted for valet ($10+tip). On the second floor we found Blue Hound, with a big modern seating area with a glowing fire, couches and chairs -- nice entry/first impression.   Service was sweet but bumpy. The food runner struggled with the heavy plates and seemed so eager to set them down, we kept having to redirect her to put the right plate in front of the right person. The time between the apps and the main course was way too long. No major foils but for the price level it just should be a lot smoother. To top off our slightly fumbly meal, at the end, we were asked to produce the promotional email for the 3 course deal  -- not the  confirmation mind, but the original marketing email -- even though we followed the instructions weeks ago that stated all we had to do was email our reservation with the promo code. Causing confusion and an awkward attempt by a few at the table to take out their phones in search of the email. Weird.  But drinks came out quickly (appreciated since they aren't just two-pour deals) and the server was fairly knowledgeable about the cocktail menu. Speaking of drinks ... this place prides itself on its bar offerings and almost every drink clocked in at $10 (at least). Eep. They had a whole section for booze aficionados that uses hard-to-find ingredients/odd pairings but ... I don't know. $20 for two drinks is A LOT, especially if you're experimenting with new liquors and ingredients as their drink menu encourages you to do.   Food pleased/impressed, for the most part. First course we ordered the mac and cheese, and the cheddar scallion biscuits with fried quail eggs and bacon jam (another thing about this place - they're on the bacon train big time, including bacon ice cream ... eh, I think everyone got over that trend before it even started); and roasted cauliflower. For mains we had a pork porterhouse, ribs with bleu cheese grits and pumpkin flatbread. The pork was good but not great, flatbread was a little boring (no pumpkin or sage flavors really popping out) and one of only substantial veggie options on the menu. The ribs were probably the star of the table - it's the size of a dinosaur bone and cooked perfectly. Desserts tried included fresh donut holes, chocolate creme brulee, treacle pudding and lime sorbet. All pretty good to excellent (though I wouldn't bother with the donut holes again, fresh but nothing special, flavor-wise).  In summary, the experience taste-wise was exactly what I was craving after living in the UK for a more than a year: that is, classic American comfort food sussed up gourmet style. But overall I don't know the food or drink prices are justifiable for a return dinner visit. However, atmosphere is modern and classy, the drinks were excellent and the care and passion put toward them is noted and appreciated - they're just a bit expensive for me. I ended up spending $140+tip for two and one of us wasn't even having cocktails!  If I still lived in Phoenix, I would probably file this one in the \"only for happy hour\" category, since they have discounted offerings for food and drinks.",

Flat bread was nothing special but the ambience was great and I would go back especially during the spring and earlier in the day... brunch and mimosas would be amazing on a warm sunny day. My only other critique is to wipe down the table... The stains were noticeable and that is not representative of a Kimpton property. Happy dining! James",

It was the comfort I didn't know I needed: the hot cheesy goodness, the perfectly al dente shells, and slightly stale fake cheese sticks that harkened me back to days of my childhood and reminded me that this too will pass and things will be ok again. So thanks Blue Hound, I will never forget that meal, and also the kindness of the bartenders and the people around me.  Much love.",

I had the blackened salmon with corn, garden vegetables (that night was mushrooms, asparagus and roasted tomatoes), and meyer lemon, which was excellent.",

    "text": "Beautiful place in Cityscape downtown Phoenix. I would surely make this a regular happy hour spot if I worked down here. My sister wanted me to try their Outlaw bourbon drink - but they had just taken it off the menu. Too bad too. Sounds amazing with smoke and bitters. Happy hour has good drink specials, but a limited bar menu. We enjoyed house chardonnay with an order of unlimited seasoned popcorn, while husband opted for a heartier burger from the bar menu. The burger smelled fantastic and he did say it was good, except for the really thick slice of velveeta on it. Great if you like that sort of thing. Burger comes with fries, on a toasted bun with crispy bacon.  We stayed for a couple drinks and headed out. It was a Monday afternoon, just before rush hour. Not a big place but comfortable.  Great place for a business meeting, or upscale stop for a classy drink with co-workers.",

Unfortunately, they have brought in a new executive chef who found it necessary to not just make some changes, but take out all time favorites only to replace them with substandard dishes. Before the new chef arrived, the place was always packed. I went on a popular Friday night, prime time, and it's was half empty. So many good restaurants out there- no need to bother with expensive mediocrity.",

Good thing we did because the place was packed. It's located in a plaza with many other food, shopping, and entertainment options. You can take stairs or an elevator to get there. It's also adjacent to a hotel and rooftop bar. The place was clearly popular as it was busy and there was an event happening which the front section was rented out for. We were approached by our server-Chris R, who took our drink orders. Our very standard bourbon on the rocks for my fiance and kettle martini for me. The drinks were great and we decided to split the burrata appetizer and the homemade pasta entree. The environment was sexy and dimly lit, our server was knowledgeable, prices were higher considering it was a nice place, and the food was delicious-it also came out fairly quick. I would gone here again for the ambience-even if it was just for drinks",

The bar atmosphere felt trendy and upscale at the same time and the menu selections were great. It was definitely the type of place I'd go back to for a proper dining experience, not jus tan I want to die because I've been traveling for the last 10 hours experience.  It seemed like the type of place where the menu changed often based on the chef's selection, and I like that. I tried the Chef Selection flatbread which that night was an arugula flatbread with grilled steak, and goat cheese. It was more than enough for me to eat, and a hard decision when there were other fantastic sounding Menu choices.",

It may have been the double vodkas, but we explained some hardships we experienced during the day leading up to our meal, without hesitation, the manager brought our bill and comped half our meal.   Not that we necessarily needed this monetarily, but morally this was spectacular. This show of humility is what I seek in everyday life and the fact it came on such a special occasion means the world.  To the Blue Hound, My wife and I can't thank you enough.

    "text": "Second floor of the Hotel Plimpton. Two blue hounds greet you over blonde wood floors in a dimly lit setting with dark wood tables. Inventive cocktails are a great way to start. Try the lawless; the glass comes upside down soaking in vanilla pipe smoke over which a tasty bourbon concoction is then poured - incredibly delicious!  Appetizers are inviting - the shishito peppers  with siracha aioli are good although no longer so imaginative as they once were. The kale salad was fresh and flavorful. Entrees are where the fool really shines. Fresh handmade pasta with cherry tomatoes are simple but tasty.  An incredibly crispy and juicy game hen with Asian flavors over a bed of fried cauliflower was phenomenal.",

    "text": "Last night was my third time here. We decided to meet friends here while waiting for a table across the street at Bitter and Twisted. It would be an hour wait they said to get a table at Bitter and Twisted so I thought that should be more than enough time to pre-drink at Blue Hound.  45 minutes after waiting, someone finally takes our drink order. Then, about 20 minutes later we get our drinks just in time for our table to be ready across the street. So, our group of 5 had to chug our cocktails, which were mostly beers and a whiskey diet for me and a vodka tonic for a friend (so easy cocktails), and pay right away to make it in time.   My 2nd time there was before a concert. My hubs and I decided to get dinner with drinks beforehand. Food was delicious. We really enjoyed the pork belly. Deviled eggs also a treat. BUT... After ordering my first drink, I asked if I could keep the cocktail menu a bit longer. The waiter looked stressed and said, \"We only have a few of these cocktail menus\" wanting to take it from me. I didn't know how to respond. I just looked at him. He then left the menu with me anyway, and when he came back, I gave the menu back to him and said that I had taken pics of the drink menu so he could have the menu back.  Awkward, right? Perhaps I was out of line just to keep the drink menu longer but I was excited to see what to order next since the cocktails are good here.   That first time here? Oh, we didn't have reservations so we didn't get a table. Understandable on a Sunday night.. We ended up seating at a table thinking that it was part of the bar area and not the restaurant. It looks like a family size round table but \"outside\" of the regular restaurant side. It's on the outside of a ceiling to floor divider. 30 minutes later, the hostess said we couldn't sit there because it's part of the restaurant. That's why we weren't able to order anything, so we walked over to Copper Blues...",

I started with the roasted asparagus that was topped with a fried egg - outstanding!! The dressing was light and flavorful!! Terrific appetizer.

I tried both and they were amazing. The curry reminded me of Thai food. It came with a tempura pea and carrot that you dip with the curry. AMAZING. The ribs were a little spicy, I could taste the tabasco sauce. My friend couldn't handle the spice but I thought it was good. Overall, I would highly recommend this place.

The outer crusted seasoning hits the palate last, and just adds a great flavor and touch of spice, and keeps you guessing as to what it is. The quinoa and red pepper pull all the flavors together perfectly.  The handmade pasta fell just a bit short. The tomatoes weren't a good ripe flavor, and the pasta was a little to mushy for my taste. Overall, I'd recommend this place for an overall good dining experience.",

Problem with the Blue Hound is there are too many choices nearby to make coming back a possibility. It may feel cool, but a lot of other places nearby feel cool, too. It's worth a visit just to check it out, but then ... it will never enter your mind again.  The Whoohoos!! - Beautifully decorated, great feeling and vibe, as another reviewer stated. It feels like a nice change of pace for Phoenix restaurants. The poolside bar is awesome and I'd go back there before this place.  The Sad Pandas - Happy hour SUCKS. I work nearby and go out at least one night a week and the Blue Hound will not be on our rotation list. \"But why?\" you ask ...  Set the scene ... four women out after work. Not looking for dinner, just some snacks while we have a drink or two and catch up.  Popcorn - sounds nummy! Not if you want more than two handfuls. For $6, we were delivered a teeny, tiny wooden bowl that you'd expect salsa to come in. In it was two medium sized handfuls of this caramel popcorn (and a lot of kernels and broken pieces). This should be given to the table gratis, if you're going to give something so small.  Deviled eggs - Wow, the presentation was beautiful I felt like Gordon Ramsey must have perfectly placed and spaced the eggs on the plate. And the four of us, now totally stuffed from our half a handful of popcorn stare down at three deviled eggs. Good thing Maria was on a diet, of else we'd have to arm wrestle for who got the eggs.  Drinks - not the worse priced, not the best. Problem was our waiter didn't seem to have a Fing clue about their unique lineup of beers. I asked for something light and summery - to which he suggest a \"summer shandy.\"  Assuming this summer shandy was the same as every other summer shandy I've had (beer mixed with lemonade), I agreed to try it on the waiter's \"It's amazing\"  What I was given haunts me in my dreams. A oddly shaped beer glass was delivered with a light, almost water color and a GIANT FREAKING CUCUMBER stuck in it.   Was I supposed to put this on my eyes? The drink smelled like a combination of facial moisturizer and salad ... both appealing combos in a drink.  That's about when my friend found the drink in their table top menu and pointed out the $10 price tag and list of liquor. This was NOT a normal summer shandy and the waiter should have told me and either pointed to it in the menu and listed the price. Granted, $10 isn't horrible, but what if I was watching my money?  When someone is trying to spend my money to raise his bill and tip, be honest with me or I'll slam your tip and warn others to be wary of the wait staff at the Blue Hound.  So bottom line ... I think this place is worth a visit, but given my experience, I will not be returning on any regular basis.",

Get it anyway.  Happy hour features select $6 cocktails (the summer smash was, well, a smash) and half-price flatbreads.  My friends noted, however, that the happy hour flatbreads were considerably smaller than the $12 standard we got later that night!  Ask for Zack - he's young, he's cute, and, I can't believe I'm putting \"best\" into one review twice, but he honestly gave the BEST service I've ever received at a restaurant - hustling to get us several rounds before happy hour closed (He even went the extra mile by rounding up an ice bucket so that the last-ditch happy hour beer ($3)  - ordered while a half-full beer sat in front of us - wouldn't get warm!).  What a very happy happy hour, indeed.",

Although their happy hour flatbreads are not big enough to get full on, they are delicious. I've tried all of them, and I like them all! I like their natural daiquiri, but my favorite drink was called, I think, 'Summer Breeze' off of the happy hour, but I'm not finding it on the online menu right now, so maybe it's seasonal.   The next thing I want to try is the pool patio bar!",

The conversational slur:  What type of tequila you got? (we're quite picky) Aw, never mind that's good (too drunk to care)   So wow it was crowded with some drunks, cool folks and young'uns.  Bartenders maintained their cool with the escalating demands... Then normalcy returned with a pleasant jibe that allowed us to absorb this fun space within the Palomar.  Menu was reasonable but bar had the most options with unusual whiskeys, oversized rocks, and signature drinks without too much sugar. Ceviche enjoyable with well brined scallops, shrimp, and chili threads.  Guess the one nagging detail was how the bar treated a young man, under dressed but paying cash...geez they requested drink payment right away then they almost double charged him for the drink when he paid up for the later  entree. Meanwhile, we hadn't even offered a credit card for our honest tab. Can't figure out that one.  Loved the oversized rocks with the whiskey and nice pours. We will be back!",

    "text": "I had a friend who stayed at the Kimpton hotel that the Blue Hound is in (I hadn't heard about it prior to this weekend) and she had a dining credit at the restaurant, so we decided to check it out.    The bad:  Our server was initially very distant and not particularly friendly. However, after looking him in the eye, saying lots of \"pleases\" and \"thank yous\" and just generally engaging him, he was so much friendlier.  The only other negative is that he seemed to get lost and didn't check back with the table often.  We would've ordered another round of drinks had he come back more often. Getting the check with difficult as well.  The I also had a friend that ordered the flatbread (not sure if it was pumpkin or sweet potato, but it was along those lines) with sage...it was a good concept, but not savory enough.  Now the good:  The server lightened up and was very sweet once he got over his initial standoffishness.  The drinks were pretty decent.  I was looking for a Moscow Mule, but the server informed me that they don't have ginger beer, but ginger simple syrup.  So we kind of improvised and it was still good.  Everyone ordered a drink off of their specialty menu and enjoyed it.  Food wise -the bottomless popcorn - YUMMY!!  And they were generous with it.  As I mentioned above, my friend ordered the flatbread - consensus at the table was that it was too sweet and not savory enough.  I ordered the trout - DELISH!!! We shared a couple of the chicory salads - pretty good...the dressing was nice and light.  Others at the table ordered the mussels and the flatbread of the night and they were all very happy.  Overall, I'd give the place another whirl...particularly for drinks!",

Slowly venturing into food menu - not as impressive as the cocktails ... up to few months ago - seem like the menu has significantly changed. Although originally we were planning only on drinks and couple of appetizers, we were so impressed with the food that we continued ordering more and more of the new menu - as we had a full dinner there at the bar. All the flatbreads were wonderful - my husband's lamb was a bomb - and they even wrapped the bones to take home for our dogs ;-O Also the pedestrian area that allows you to walk right in (very unique in PHX) makes it perfect spot to enjoy urban life - coming from Prague - this makes me feel closer to home.",

I think I ruined all of them to going out to eat at other Kitchens forever.  We started with tater tots, charred pork belly sliders and the family farmed cheese plate.  I don't think anything says family dinner like reaching over each other for another delicious bite because everything is addictively good.  Up next we had the cured strawberry & fennel flat bread, crispy salt and pepper shrimp,  BBQ short ribs an added bonus was something Chef Brent whipped up was snapper on french role with a sweet jelly and citrus aioli.   I would have never thought white fish and jelly would go together but I was so very wrong.  For desert with had their pineapple upside down cake with date ice cream, chocolate Creme Brulee, and finally the strawberry shortcake served in a jar.  This is my first review I have ever felt the need to write and I think that I need to work on my description because I certainly cannot describe the amazing flavors appropriately with words.  What I can do is encourage you to find out for yourself and enjoy every minute of it.",

    "text": "Went to Blue Hound a couple of nights ago for the first time with friends.  The hotel and restaurant had a cool and hip atmosphere.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time and the place was not crowded.  Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable and recommended several things on the menu including the special which was soft shell crab over an artichoke coulis with fiddlehead fern.  I ordered the special (and a shot of gazpacho) and the others at the table ordered a flatbread pizza and tater tots (yum!), the salmon, and the chicken.  When the salmon came out, it was such a tiny portion and my friend commented on it.  I had an option of ordering one or two crabs with my dinner and I opted for one after asking our server if it would be plenty of food.  I should have ordered two.  The food at Blue Hound is creative, ubber fresh, and delicious.  However, we all left still feeling hungry due to the small portion sizes.  We talked about ordering more food but the items are quite pricey and our bill was already over $100 without tip (only two of us had an alcoholic drink).  We eat out frequently at all of the new hip and trendy places that are opening all over Phoenix and feel that with all the other restaurants who are now offering creative farm to table food at  lower prices and larger (yet reasonably sized) portions, Blue Hound has some adjusting to do.  It would be a tough sell to get me to go back unless I knew our bellies would be full and our bill not so high.",

My husband ordered the spanish omelette which was decent, both portion size and taste wise, but the taste was still nothing great.

    "text": "I agree with another poster who loved the urban vibe of this restaurant/bar. What a cool place! We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Once seated, we waited for a while for service. I flagged down the manager, and a server came over immediately. The drink menu is extensive with over 30 specialty drinks, so I decided to forgo my usual beer for a fancy beverage, a Absinthe Fizz. My husband stuck with a glass of Pino. When our drinks arrived, mine was frothy and delicious! I highly recommend trying this drink if you want something refreshing but not froo froo. We order the tater tots as an appetizer, per a suggestion from a Kimpton sales rep my husband met through work. I ordered the Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio and my husband ordered the Kentucky Fried Quail. The tots were wonderful, but I really didn't get the sauce. It was cold and did not have much flavor. Our food arrived while we were working on our appetizer. The entrees were excellent! Portions are small, but were fine for a light dinner. We actually went across the street to Copper Blues for a drink, then we returned to Blue Hound for a nightcap. We ended up sitting in a cozy booth by the bar upon our return. We ordered the Mac N Cheese to split and Tommy's Margarita. The Mac N Cheese was wonderful, but the portion was quite small. On the flip side, the prices are super reasonable, so if you are really hungry, order 2 appetizers with your meal. A couple of kinks, which is to be expected when you choose to dine at a new restaurant.  There were many items on the menu I wanted to try, so we will definitely return!",

Nice lighting and decor. The food was... Pretty good. I tried a number of appetizers. The deviled eggs were unexceptional. They tried doing something interesting with this sweet bacon in there but it could have used a bit more punch and a little less sweet. The deviled fried oysters also lacked that punch. But they were tasty on their own and nicely fried. The grits they came with were an odd accompaniment. The short rib sliders were quite good. Although again could have used some other flavor - some tartness or some spice to offset the umami short rib. The Brussels sprouts were outstanding! Sauteed with a Korean style barbecue sauce. Not too sweet, which I often find to be the case. I am definitely going to steal this recipe! I will probably go back and try an entree next time.",

    "text": "We came here for a birthday party with an area that was reserved. The restaurant knew we were coming and expected a large cocktailing crowd. The problem was management only placed one cocktail server in this area and she was not well trained on service. We sat down and ordered a btl of wine, a beer, and two appetizers. The food arrived with no napkins or silverware. The bottle of wine arrived 15 mins after the food with no bucket of ice. The beer never arrived. I finally scolded the server and she brought a beer, but never brought out napkins, a manager never came and asked us if everything was ok, the food runner was the only person responsive. The food was ok but the service was pitiful! I ran several high end restaurants in NYC and would have been fired if I ran a restaurant like this place even for one night. If they do not get their act together it will be closed shortly! I won't go back!",

    "text": "We went to the Blue Hound during Phoenix's Mardi Gras festival. Surprisingly the bar area was practically empty. There was a wedding party of approximately 8 people getting their picture taken at the bar while lifting champagne flutes but other than that the place was empty. Two bartenders were at the bar, I won't say working the bar as every open space at the bar (all seats except where the wedding party was) was cluttered with detritus from the previous patron and the bartenders were not doing anything but chatting with the wedding party. We stood at the bar (no one near us for ten feet to a side) yet were firmly ignored for 5 minutes. I guess they must have a different revenue stream than customers as they sure lost two that day. We went to Tom's Tavern across the street and had some great cocktails. I understand difficulty in getting service at a crowded bar, but come on, two customers at an empty bar and you never even greet them...",

Also knew one of the cocktail servers.  Fantastic cocktail bar with an antique concoctions menu and bartenders who know how to make old school drinks, bartenders were friendly and knew a lot about their trade, tools and drinks which was both educational and unusual.  Place is a bit pricey for what I think you get but it is a Kimpton hotel bar so.  As a hotel bar it did the trick, neither amazed nor dissapointed.",

But from the moment we sat down, the service was slow and the food took 50 minutes to be served. The restaurant was not busy what so ever, so there was NO excuse. Just another example of a restaurant  with poor to no management. It seemed like the place was being run by a bartender, on waiter, and a cook..... So much potential, but they don't take their fine establishment seriously. The \"bottomless\" Bloody Mary seemed to be mostly mix, next to no vodka.",

The liquor choice were impressive, but the martinis were skimpy.  The service was spotty, at times a bit intrusive, at others, hard to find the waiter.  We sampled two appetizers.  The pulled pork johnny cakes were wonderful, the tater tots  not so much (they were more like hush puppies in texture).  I had the BBQ'D Kobe Beef Short Ribs for the entree and my dining companion had the New England Diver Scallops.  The ribs were quite tasty and went well with the bleu cheese grits, but were a bit fatty.  The scallops were a tad too salty and had some grit or shell.  Willing to try the place again because we enjoyed the environment, and this is a decent achievement for a downtown restaurant in a hotel, but there is room for improvement.",

The bread that was served with it was too hard. We had the trout-which was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of spice.  My partner had the rositto which was great.  He also had the ceviche.  The ceviche was way too bland like the pate.  Maybe they are being careful on the spices.  It has only been open a few days so they need a chance to work out the bugs. If you like your food on the bland side you will enjoy the food.",

    "text": "I came to dinner  here  to celebrate my 33 year anniversary, unfortunately it was not a very good dining experience.    The first mistake was the confusion of this restaurant and its theme.   When I asked the waiter what the theme is ,he said it was like ordering Spanish tapa's a little bit of everything .. but when you look at menu I didn't see how that was possible... but ok. I was given a drink menu,  I was impressed with it.. but I'm more of a traditional mixed drink person. So I figured they must have a great bar service or fantastic bar tenders .   I ordered a Manhattan straight which just means without the ice.   Well somehow they got confused how to serve it  as I watching them they were pouring the drink  into a on the rocks glass so naturally it doesn't fill the glass because it's without the ice.. It was the funniest thing to watch .    So the waiter comes over with a look of concern and tells me they would like to serve it with the large ice cubes they offer.. at that point I just accepted the drink that way.. but all they needed to do was to serve it in a martini glass.   Now for my wife's drinks...    She orders a margerita  with a agave syrup the drink comes and it tasted sour no hint of agave  she sends it back.. she orders a plain Gin and tonic.. drink comes and guess what the tonic was flat..   so at 10 dollars a drink or more .. I would have expected something  extra ordinary instead we got something that you would order at your local gin mill.  Ordered the flatbread as an appetizer  it was really good so I figured ok let's forget about the drink fiasco..  Main course  Blacken sea bass.. It was good but filled with too many bones I had to pick at the fish with my hands so that I would not swallow  the bones.   My wife ordered the lamb meatballs she liked them and so did I  but not worth the price.  So what did like about this place..   our waiter was very good, the manager came over and bought us dessert because of the drinks fiasco, beautiful urban style setting.    Would I come back?  probably not..",

I dined here 2x on my trip and thought both times it was very mediocre.  The Brussels and the cauliflower apps were my two favorite things on the menu.  The Brussels were great, they were dressed with a Cesar dressing and parm cheese.  The brussels were cooked perfectly both nights.  I was very pleased with these... I really could had these for my main meal with something else small on the side.  The first night I had the scallops and they were pretty decent, I would say just nothing special.  The 2nd time around I had the seabass and it was incredibly fishy.  I am a FISH GIRL... so fishy doesn't bother me, however the seabass was just not cooked incredibly well and I didn't think the flavors came together.  I thought the atmosphere was nice.  The drinks were pretty good too!",

My husband treated me to VIP tickets for Train at Comerica so I treated him to dinner prior to the show....so wanted this place to be great.  Our creds: late 30's executives...DINK's so we enjoy fine dining often. Favorite Gastro-pub in Valley: Citizen Public House Scottsdale...also love Cowboy Caio in Scottsdale.  Pros: - walking distance to downtown venues - industrial chic decor - best cocktail menu I have ever seen  Cons: - Ironically, the food. Appetizers: pork bellies and cheddar biscuit apps. Pork bellies...we KNOW pork bellies...all over foodie menus across town...these were like rubber bacon. If you want fantastic pork bellies, go to Citizen Public House or Arrogant Butcher. Cheddar biscuits were good but nothing interesting. Dinner: husband had pork neck..it was nice looking but very ordinary and bland. I had Fried Quail...it was yummy...tasted exactly like KFC...came with cold corn bread, cold gravy and precisely 5 cold beans...could not taste the foie gras in the cornbread. Husband asked for bread to have with his pork neck soup...server said they didn't have bread but he would ask the kitchen...he came back with 2 tiny crostinis in a soup bowl...dry, tasteless, odd.  - The service. Hostess (on 9/30 at 5pm) tried to seat us in an almost empty dining room at the one table right next to the table bussing station. REALLY? We asked for another table and she said we can't have any other table because she had to save those for groups of 4...completely understood so we took a table in a far corner. 5 minutes later she sat a couple at the 4-up...she was also unfriendly and didn't seem to want to be there. Our server was blah and wasn't at all passionate about the menu options...Servers at Arrogant Butcher are awesome!  In closing...if you want a fantastic foodie meal in downtown, go to Arrogant Butcher...if you are in Scottsdale, go to Citizen Public House..ENJOY!",

Being across from US Airways Center and the ballpark make this one of the top choices before an event. The Pork Belly sliders are my go to for every trip.  It is a great place to taste a few different things when you are with a group.  Our server this time was Caleb and helped us narrow down our selections.  And though Sangria is not on their menu (it should be) they whipped a very tasty one up for me.  The only negative thing I could come up with is the noise level.  It is a fun place to be but the acoustics can make it a little hard to hear.",

    "text": "Blue Hound blew my mind!  I know it has been said 100 times, but this really IS what downtown needs. No more chains or mediocre hotel restaurants - but a classy, unique downtown destination with an honest to goodness \"mixologist\" running the bar.    They offer a decent sized happy hour menu featuring about 6 of their cocktails at 6 bucks a pop, $3 beers, and $6 flatbreads,. I had a smashing good time with my Summer Smashes and enjoyed tastes of all the well crafted cocktails my friends ordered.  We were even given an ice bucket for a can of beer (classy! Like I said!). The flatbread was so flavorful and rich, even though it was a bit on the small size.  Our waiter, Zack, handled our large party very well and didn't bat an eye when we asked for separate checks.   Nicely split sections with a lounge, bar, and restaurant Blue Hound can host a variety of different moods and a cocktail for every occasion!",

Overall, everything was a greasy soggy mess. I was very disappointed by my $16.00 lunch bill. Two stars are for the great service I received.",

The menu is a collection of interesting dishes that can be ordered by size, and are meant to be shared with your table.    Definitely try the bacon jam biscuits with the quail egg - easily the best thing I've ever eaten in Phoenix, a True gem.  The flat breads were decent.  Also had the BBQ ribs and homemade tots - all of which were tasty in small quantities, which is exactly what tapas are meant to be.  The atmosphere is a bit hotel-ish and overly modern hipster.  Even the wait staff is overly-casual in attire, although they were all quite friendly and attentive.  This is a great place to take a date and show off - check it out",

This time I ordered the cheese board and just like the last time, there were like 3 cheeses, pistachios, another kind of nut, jam, bread, etc. Very good and plentiful. Last time, we ordered the warm mixed nuts that were really good but I couldn't eat too much of it. My husband ordered this pork dish that had hominy, and I don't remember what else but it was freakin awesome. I kept eating out of his skillet. Yum. My $10 specialty cocktail was knock me on my ass strong but good. I gave it to my husband after while because I would have been drunk just off the one. I guess that is a good problem to have. The service was top-notch. She was just the right amount of attentive and did a great job. The decor was bright and modern. I really enjoyed this last experience.",

Very well decorated and unique, from the lighting fixtures to the coffee tables.  The food of course, was the best part of the night. Sergio was our server, and was able to help us by explaining the drink menu and the dinner menu. He made great suggestions for both, noting that for the dinner menu, it was more tapas and family style which works best for me. Sergio was also very attentive through out the night.  The Summer of Shandies cocktail was very yummy that I might just try to replicate it at home. We tried a number of dinner items, all which were full of different but great flavors. My favorites though, were the tomato heirloom salad, zucchini corn dogs,and  the short rib. For dessert, I would recommend the cake n shake. the cake part is definitely sharable but the shake, too good to share :)  Both managers that were on the floor, Cheyenne and Matt, even stopped by to check how our evening was going.  For the quality and the attention to detail that is spent to create the variety of cocktails and food, the value is definitely justified.  I cannot stress enough how wonderful the service was and how delicious the food tasted. I will definitely be back for dinner and to try out Lustre the pool bar!",

    "text": "I'll comment on something that was great first - the decor! Very modern but warm with wood, glass and metal. It's a bit loud, but it was Friday night, so pretty busy. The seating was comfortable, nice looking bar, etc. The the lighting over the bar area was gorgeous.   I really wanted to like this restaurant - Phoenix Magazine certainly did...it's on their Top 10 New Restaurants list in the current issue. From the raving review, it sounded great -- so a group of us hopped on the Metro and headed downtown to try it Friday night.   To sum it up, Phoenix magazine needs to hire new food critics - this is not one of the top 10 new restaurants in Phoenix this year.   The service was mediocre. The waiter forgot 2 dishes, and was irritated because we were trying to figure out who owed what on the bill...while we had our coffee.  For appetizers, we had the Tater tots, deviled eggs & the caramel corn for appetizers: The tater tots were very flavorful. The deviled eggs were okay, but not great. Just not spiced well. The caramel corn was really good with the chili pepper and caramel sort of blending together.    The short ribs on a bed of blue cheese grits was really very good, probably the best thing on the menu.  The pork neck was bland. The ceviche was not very chilled, and also tasted bland. The Kale salad was ok, but kinda just a big pile of chopped kale with dressing on it and a few croutons tossed on top. Two people had the mac & cheese and thought it was good, but the serving was really small.   The wine I had was pretty good, but they didn't have the one on the menu that I wanted so suggested the wine they'd replaced it with. (only the replacement wine was $12 a glass & the one I'd wanted was $8!)  Several other people had cocktails and they all enjoyed them. So I'm thinking the bar is probably the highlight of this restaurant!  Sorry, but Blue Hound is just not even near the top 10 new restaurants.",

The dining room and bar are pretty small, so the atmosphere is lively even if there are only a few tables occupied and a few guests at the bar. I think its a really good idea to offer most dishes in a small or standard size - perfect for sharing and portion control.   The service is still a work in progress, I believe. Its a new restaurant, so its still getting into the swing of things.   We saw Chef Stephen Jones working in the kitchen and I thought that it was cool that he was there personally overseeing the kitchen.   We tried the highly recommended Kentucky Fried Quail and the Tater-tots. The quail was delicious! But all of the accompaniment were a little bland I thought.   Overall the food was innovative and delicious- but somehow a little less than what I expected from \"one of the best new restaurants in Phoenix.\"",

Having heard good things from another family member, we decided to give Blue Hound a try, and I'm glad we did.  The inside decor is trendy and simple.  We sat at the couch by the door (since that was what was available) and were quite comfortable - except for the occasional draft from the door.  Our waitress was ok, she wasn't entirely too friendly, but she took care of our needs.  As for the food, we ordered pretty much all the appetizers.  The biggest highlight was the scones with bacon jam.  In fact, it was so good, it's inspired me to make these two things at home to see if I can replicate it.  We also had the popcorn, which was good and the sliders, which were alright.  The pizza with duck was great (could have been crisper) as was the other items we had.  Based on the previous reviews it seems this place, being new, might be hit or miss.  I'd say give it a try if you're in the area... why not?  Trust me, it's worth a visit for the cheddar scallion scones with bacon jam!",

The decor is very trendy and modern with a mish-mash of great furniture the comes of looking lovely.   The selection for breakfast was a nice variation and everyone seemed to enjoy what they got. It is a bit pricey here, for example a small glass of apple juice was abut $4 but personally that's why I just stick to water wherever I go. Our waitress did seem a bit scatter-brained but the service was good. I don't normally get a chance to try out places in downtown Phoenix so I'm glad our friends suggested this place.

    "text": "Slow Service and Overpriced  Two and a half hours and $136 for 10oz of alcoholic beverages, 6 tator tots, flatbread, dry chicken and cold steak.  I went here with my wife for our 5-yr dating anniversary.  We had a $50 gift card, and I naively came here thinking we would have a \"free\" meal, but it didn't even cover half the price of our dining experience. The drinks we got were good, but they just cost too much for the tiny little glass of cocktail you get.  My wife's amaretto sour couldn't have been more than 2 or 3 ounces, and it cost $15.  So yeah, you pay a lot for little cutesy cocktails. The tator tots and flatbread were probably the best things we got ($20 for those two items). My wife got the herb roasted chicken for $24 and the chicken was pretty bland and dry.  I got the flat-iron steak ($30), which tasted really good.  The only problem was it was cold-well, cool rather.  But it was as if the steak had been sitting on my plate for 25 minutes before I got it, which may be just what happened.  It took an hour to get our food after we ordered it.  After 55 minutes of waiting, I had to leave to go re-fill our parking meter, so I got to get some exercise in the middle of our dining experience.  It was like our outside table was forgotten.   Our waiter was great, but he had a bunch of inside tables, so we just hardly ever saw him.  My water glass was usually empty, and we were typically waiting a while before we could order something. The atmosphere is cool, and I did enjoy the tator tots and the taste of my steak.  If the whole meal had been closer to $50, and if the service had been faster, I could give this place 4-5 stars probably.  But as it was, it was just too expensive for what we got.",

The cocktail list is intriguing and extensive, without being overwhelming. The food menu had a number of great options--a mix of comfort food and little plates that all sounded delicious. We went with the cheese board, which--at $22--was a bit pricey, was well worth it. It was comprised of 3 different cheeses(a manchego, an aged cheddar, and a delightfully funky sheeps' milk cheese), plus marcona almonds, prosciutto, Granny Smith Apple slices, dates, coarse mustard, pickled green beans, pickled peppers, and a lovely spiced flatbread and a soft brown bread. I ordered the Brown Derby, a bourbon based cocktail that was exactly what I'd been craving--a wonderful balance of sweet and tangy. Hubby had the Zombie, and it was the best Zombie we've ever had. Overall, Blue Hound is the perfect spot for date night--laid back but still romantic and interesting(without being pretentious), and the service was top notch.",

Yep, the entire right page of this simple menu is cocktails -- and for good reason. The cocktails here are just epic! And the food -- while clearly playing a supporting role -- carries the experience superbly. The appetizers are unique, delish, and fun. The entrees are very hearty portions, and with exceptional presentation and flavor.  Particulars? Too many to cataloge, but now these. The pork chop entree is simply massive -- it's actually two pork chops. Totally wonderful, but consider sharing. Shrimp and grits was the bomb. Shishito peppers appetizer was novel and fun to all. Boudin balls were gobbled up before you could blink. Heck, you could just order 2 appetizers per diner and be more than satisfied.  And oh yeah.... someone in your party MUST order a \"Lawless.\" On my first visit, that someone was me, and I was thrilled with my choice. The Lawless is a rye cocktail that's embellished with -- ready for this? -- vanilla tobacco smoke. The cool part is not just how fun it is to watch them prep it, it's that the smoke MAKES the drink!  Blue Hound is a little pricey, but if you are in downtown and want a great meal, it's more than worth it. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I will definitely plan to eat -- and drink! -- here again.",

I also have the deviled eggs which were beautifully presented. Not really the traditional flavor but still pretty good. I'm curious to try their dinner now.",

I'd bookmarked Blue Hound on the recommendation of a colleague and jumped at the opportunity to take a friend there from out of town. The hostess who sat is was warm and friendly as she walked us to our table. We were about 15 minutes late for our reservation and had a good joke once we arrived. Once we were seated, per usual we are talking more than paying attention to the menu; however, Christopher was still very attentive and not overbearing.   For a cocktail I had the Lawless and it did not disappoint!! The frozen glass over a tobacco skillet and the whiskey poured after was the perfect balance and was amazing.   For appetizers, we ordered deviled eggs and pork ribs. The eggs had a sweet bacon pop in the middle that gave the last bite that WOW effect and the pork ribs were perfect.   For my entree I ordered the blackened salmon and the fish along with its pairings just had all my senses in overdrive!!!   I must admit navigating to the restaurant was a bit confusing at first but, I'd only knock off a .1 of a star! Now that I know exactly where it is, I should have no problems but my friend will say I'm logistically challenged no matter what!",

Both were delicious. For our meals we ordered the Arctic Char and Prime Flat Iron, all were mouthwateringly good! Drinks were plenty and they have a great wine menu.

Then have a great selection of bourbons - I went with Blantons and Hudson Baby Bourbon.  Got a little hungry later and ordered the shrimp and grits which were outstanding - the shrimp, andouille sausage, grits, everything was on point.  Saved half of it for the next day.

From being greeted right when I walked in, the beautiful bar, the restaurant set up, the music, the vibes. The restaurant is modern with a rustic feel. Loved all the wood. My server Daniel was AMAZING! He was so genuine, friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable about ALL the menu items, as well as the area. He also suggested a few cool bars in the area to check out which was really helpful. I ate the deviled eggs and the BLT w/salad, the ahi tuna, brussel sprouts, flatbread and sliders. Didn't wait long for the food at all and the food was QUALITY. On top of having a great experience, as I just left the restaurant I ran into a gentlemen wearing a blue hound uniform outside, his name was Logan. And he is one of the sou chefs. I told him the food was sooo good, and we chatted a bit. He was nice and told me to come back, so I came back that evening with my friend once she landed. I enjoyed both times eating here, 5 stars across the board. Thank you Blue Hound for your hospitality...I will be back! :)  -Britney Valerio",

    "text": "My partner and I visited Phoenix this past weekend. Right before our flight back home on Monday evening, we wanted to grab a quick bite and beer during happy hour time, and stumbled upon Blue Hound (more like read many Yelp reviews on good happy hours nesrby). Walking in to the place, we were caught off guard because it is very beautful inside with very high ceilings - and a very business dinner, elegant date type vibe. Seeming to be underdressed (who would have though for a happy hour), we were greeted upon arrival and quickly seated - in a perfect little secluded two-seat table overlooking downtown. The happy hour menu was simple with delicious bites and decent drink specials - we had the chicken wings, mac and cheese, and shisito peppers with their Blue Hound beer. The chicken wings were cooked to the perfect texture with the right amount of sauce I was looking for (not smothered), the mac and cheese was of a white cheddar variety topped with cheetos - this was a little runny but delicious nonetheless, but my partner felt ir would've went well with some bread, and the shisito peppers were cooked to perfection with a very simple seasoning - I'm used to these with salt and these didn't have that which I liked but others may not. Lastly, their house beer was only $5 during happy hour and it was a very solid beer for a lighter variety - had great substance without being watery or off flavor. Looking over their regular menu, I wished we had more time because the plates sounded delicious, and I was confident they would come through with the same quality as their happy hour menu food. We had the pleasure of being attended by Carolina. Her level of attentiveness was of perfection - She checked in at all the right times in a very genuine, professional, yet laid-back fashion. She made sure everything was brought out quickly and even made some awesome recommendations if we wanted to replicate the shisito peppers after my partner inquired about the seasoning. She definitely made our visit that much more special. We will be back again to try dinner if we're ever back in the area :)",

A quick summary: great atmosphere, versatile enough to host dates as well as larger groups, a menu that could feed any type of consumer, and a full bar to help pair your food with the best wine or create a fun cocktail.   Coming this a large group, we of course started with appetizers. This is where my only complaint lies - we were served a meta and cheese board, but they never told us what the different meats and cheeses were... we had to guess and the waiter also wasn't familiar when we asked. Past this, the food, atmosphere, and value were all spot on. And if you do go, you cannot miss their homemade pies. The crust literally melts in your mouth with the amount of butter baked into it.",

Comfortably busy we found two seats at the long bar table across from a video roadie who was with Muse and Walk the Moon. (FYI The Talking Stick Arena is across the street.) The waitress was very prompt. She didn't have a beer/wine list, but we told her what we wanted, a Weiss beer and a stout. She didn't have either, and brought us samples of beers similar. That was nice, but didn't get the names. All we know is that one was a lager, the other a wheat beer. Ordered a shrimp cocktail and Mac and cheese. Both were good. The venue is modern and stylish with the large bar in front and restaurant tables in the back. Check it out.",

    "text": "This spot came up during my research of tasty food, and also recommended by locals. There was a blue hound dog welcoming us next to the host/hostess station. The first area is occupied mainly by a large bar. They had a few happy customers enjoying some drinks.  They had two dining areas, one with the bar and the back room which seems to be the main dining area. The space is pretty dim, producing relaxing and romantic atmosphere.  The cocktail menu had a name and description of the drink on one page, followed by the photo of each drinks. It was nice to be able to see what the cocktails would look like before deciding which one to order. I actually picked the cocktail from the photo, since I knew I wanted one with egg whites on top. I went with a cocktail named Lion King. I loved the egg whites, exactly what I wanted! It was topped with black berry which was a bit sour. The cocktail itself was really tasty, sweet and elegant, delicious cocktail.  For food, I decided to order two appetizers as both appetizers and main, so that I can try more than one items without stuffing myself. I ordered Corn Grit Fries and Pulled Pork Sliders.  Portion of the Corn Grits was more than enough to share, my co-worker also got to have couple of pieces. It was a bit too heavy to stay in one piece, as I tried to pick it up with a fork. It was tasty but I think I had a too high of an expectation, that it didn't wow me. Pulled Pork Sliders were much better, very tasty and comforting. Really enjoyed it!    I ended the dinner with a dessert called BHKC Pudding. It was simple but very tasty. Creamy and velvety with nice firm consistency. Nice way to end the pleasant meal.",

I was told we were not able to have a reservation for a large party for my graduation dinner, yet the staff was super kind and accommodating and we ended up getting a table for all 13 of us 1/2 though ordering drinks and apps.   The point that was a little annoying was my friend was able to organizer the birthday dinner and have a table reserved for 10 and was told they can use the fridge for cake if needed (for a fee, but I would have liked to do that). The good is amazing (blackened salmon for sure) and the atmosphere is definitely a vibe I love, I just don't know what miscommunication happened between who I spoke to and who my friend spoke to. If you want to come here for an occasion, it's phenomenal, just be sure to ask all of your questions and know what you can and cannot do. Enjoy, drink, and be merry!",

There is only one vegan option, but serious props for that, as a lot of hotel restaurants lack even meaningful vegetarian choices! I had the crispy quinoa with vegetables, and it was good. I don't really have much else to say about it: it was good.. not bad, not great.  They have a huge selection of interesting cocktails, which I heard other patrons commenting positively on.

I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had blackened salmon. He said his was good, not the best he's had. My shrimp and grits had a great flavor. It had sausage it in which gave it a great taste. The service was pretty good. I think my favorite part was when they brought the check in a book where you could write messages. I thought that was pretty cool.

The menu is small but there is a nice variety. The specialty cocktails are wonderful and each dish is thoughtfully created, prepared and beautifully plated. This time we started with a bread plate and the pickled vegetables that came with it were so good!   I ordered a sirloin with horseradish sauce. The steak was perfectly medium-rare as I ordered. My husband does not eat meat. He ordered the Caesar salad and loved it. Our dessert was lemon meringue pie!  Yummy. Our server was attentive without being overbearing and the timing of the meal was great.

I reviewed the drink list and thought they were a bit overpriced at $8 for a can of beer, $15 for mixed drinks, and various prices on the wine selection.  I had water.   We ordered an appetizer selecting the chicharrones ($9). They were bought out rather quickly and tasted like they were fresh out of a bag purchased at the local Walmart.  They added some nuked cheese dip and charged me 9 bucks. I've had these in Houston and my expectations far exceeded what they delivered. The server was generous and did not hesitate the remove the charge.   I had their shrimp and grits ($28). The presentation was rather plain, but the meal was pretty good. Their rue is more tomatoey than creole, but good and a nice twist. I initially considered the serving size small, but after finishing my meal, found it quite adequate.   Would I recommend this place?  Maybe if you wanted to impress a date or celebrate a special occasion.",

We had already had dinner before coming here, so did not get anything to eat so this review is strictly for drinks and menu.   This was my first time here and I guess they changed their drink menu for Chinese New Year ( year of the dog) for the entire year. How unfortunate for the servers this entire year. The new menu is very large and all pictures. The last page does have an explanation of the origins of the drink but no explanation of what is actually in the drink, not even the alcohol type. If you are a fan of alcohol drink roulette, this menu is for you. We are not fans, so our poor waitress stood their with us for a good 20 minutes every time we wanted to try something else. What a waste of time. I came there to talk to my friends, not the waitress. No offense to her.   The first drink I ordered was the one with boba in it. It had a matcha like flavor to it with coconut milk. It was ok. What made it horrible was the boba at the bottom. It wasn't under cooked. It was still raw. The boba balls were super hard.   The second drink I ordered I think it had gin in it and it had egg whites in it. It had a really light and airyness to it with a touch of lime. I liked this one better than the first one but still didn't love it.   The last one (picture not taken) was a cocktail that was mostly a mixtures of bitters and that one surprisingly delicious. The drink was rather on the smaller side though so keep that in mind.  The tiki drink that is in my pictures looked cute and my friend ordered it. She seemed to like. She didn't say one way or another.   Dont forget to park in the parking garage below the restaurant. The restaurant validates parking so parking will be free, which is nice.   Drinks- 3 stars.  Drink menu- 1 star. Ambiance- 4 stars. Free parking in garage- 5 stars Total- 3 stars",

How ever the food was okay, they gave us the wrong flat bread & when told they let us have the wrong one to munch on (we were starving!) and made the correct one - I think, it said pork belly was on it but it looked more like brisket. They also gave us some Carmel popcorn (the best part of the meal! Then at the end we ordered 2 cappuccinos but they were clearly espresso with no milk, and had to request half and half to go with it. So in short- okay food, excellent service, with some hiccups that were addressed extremely graciously.",

    "text": "I know it's been said already -- but I will echo: this is the type of place downtown Phoenix sorely needs. As a frequent visitor to the area, I've noticed that there is a definite lack of urban, food-centric downtown restaurants with an eye towards innovation. That's what the Blue Hound gives you. The ability to choose small plates or full size entrees is also a nice touch, giving guests the ability to do their own tasting menu of sorts. And with lots of interesting dishes, small plates is the way to go.  Went this past weekend and can tell you, the food was wonderful (bacon jam!) and the atmosphere was great. It's a double edged sword - you don't want to have to wait for a table but it does make it feel more city like when there is a wait. Staff was attentive and Luis the manager did a nice job of going table to table to make sure every guests got a visit.   I'm hoping this place stays for awhile and continues to come up with creative ways to bring a more urban food scene downtown!",

    "text": "I'm a foodie and a discerning customer. I enjoy many of the qualities of a restaurant that aims to be a finer-end establishment, such as this one, but I can equally enjoy a hole-in-the-wall if the food and service are good.  This restaurant had neither.   - Incompetence - I just had an evening here with a large group.  The management was very professional, as was our waiter in tending to our guest's needs.  Several things went wrong, however, and the food is just not good.  We ordered plates of the fries and aioli for the table.  One friend is severely lactose-intolerant, so we asked that fries be provided without the cheese.  Finally, 20+ minutes later his fries arrived, but still with cheese.  His entre later in the evening also had cheese he asked not to be included.   - Overrated Drink Options - It's True there is an encyclopedic drink menu, although most the options are overpriced for what you get.  When I was waiting for friends at the bar before our meal, the bartender was rude and stopped filling my order halfway through to talk to her coworker for several minutes.  - Horrible food - Let me cut to the chase on this one.  I ordered the lamb meatballs. I got a full entre. They were inedible.  The lamb apparently died in a pepper mill explosion. I should have sent the dish back but we were already behind schedule on the rest of our evening, and I couldn't wait for them to correct the problem.  I can't think of the last time I ate something that was so horrible I couldn't bear to finish it. I like almost anything.  There were other problems with the food.  The greens in my salad had spoiled.  Many other guests did not enjoy there meals.  It's True that most of the entres are overpriced, so they offer \"medium\" sized or tapas options. This is just pretentious.  If your entre was decent enough to eat, customers won't mind paying more.  Several people ordered the salmon full entre and it was a thinly-sliced piece of barely cooked salmon on a plate.  The food all came in stupid iron pans that are too small to reach in and cut your meat with a knife.  - Checks - For our dozens guests or so, our polite waiter was not polite enough to allow us to charge the bill to separate credit cards. I don't know how you're supposed to pay a $500 bill in cash among so many people. We should have brought a cpa to tabulate our invoice.  The waiter did include his 20% gratuity, thankfully.  In conclusion, skip this restaurant.",

We sat at the bar first: bartenders were helpful and went out of their way to create the drink we wanted. Fantastic.  We sat inside (must say the patio looked off the hook) and enjoyed ordering 7-8 appetizers to share among all.  I think the appetizers are comparable to the entrees as far as variety.  Not sure the waiter was too happy about a table ordering just appetizers - but oh well, we are the patrons, right ??  Definitely be back.    One more thing that was great - they validated parking in the underground garage.  Yes!!  No nickel and dimming here....",

    "text": "Blue Hound.  Oh how I want to love you.  I've stayed at the Palomar in San Francisco and was so excited they built one here.  I figured the Blue Hound had to be awesome.   The decor is what I expected.  Super hip with a floor to ceiling windows that gave us a great view of CityScape from our table.   The menu is very intriguing with items such as fried quail, cheddar scallion biscuits, and Kobe beef short ribs.  All of those items were fairly tasty as well.  The short ribs were a little difficult to eat and I think they were cooked a little too long.   The service needs work.  We wanted to get a bottle of wine and asked our server for a recommendation.  I understand he was no sommelier, but figured he'd have some knowledge on their offerings.  I let him know my tastes and said I normally get chardonnay, but would like to try something new and would like to hear what he recommended.  He said if we like chardonnay, get chardonnay.  Mmmmmmmkay.  So much for trying something new.  I am allergic to eggs and asked him if the fried quail was dipped in an egg wash before frying.  He replied by saying he had no idea things were dipped in egg before frying and that he learned something new.  I like to go to restaurants to try new things and trust the servers know more about the menu than I do and can assist me in finding the right options.  I got the impression that servers here are just order takers and food runners.  I recommend a little training on the menu items for the servers.   This was my second time at Blue Hound.  The first time we sat at a table in the lounge area for 10 minutes and was never addressed so left.  The food was not memorable enough to overlook the lackluster service.  I was invited to a birthday there recently and opted to meet the group after they left.  They let me know the service was terrible again.  It's a shame.  If the employee vibe was elevated, this could be a great spot to hang out at while downtown.",

My friend and I started with the Desert Gin & Tonic and Lost Melody. The Gin & Tonic was extra good because it was made with premium ingredients but mine was sublime! One of those dangerous drinks that will go down easy and sneak up on ya.   APPETIZERS:   TATER TOTS: smoked bacon, chive, romesco sauce  - adult version of the school lunch favorite. Very tasty.  CHARRED PORK BELLY SLIDERS: kimchi, peanuts on King's Hawaiian bread - We ordered the half order (2). But after we were done, we looked at each other like...we should have ordered 4!   DINNER:   POT PIE: root vegetables, mushrooms, swiss chard - Pretty darn good. I didn't even miss the meat!   BBQ'D BEEF SHORT RIBS w/ Anson Mills' blue cheese grits - One large Flintstone bone in a cast iron bowl. The meat was tender and the flavor was amazing. The taste and texture of the grits were on point too. My only \"beef\" was that it came out room temperature. Which made the grits congeal a little. I was very disappointed by that and felt the dish could have been even better if it were hot!   MORE DRINKS:   LAWLESS: Breaking & Entering bourbon, bitters, wormwood liqueur, tobacco smoked glass. Great presentation and perfectly balanced flavors.   Finally - desert was the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake and coffee. The cake was really good. Again a classic that was on point. They must have a thing with food temperature, because the decaf coffee was ice cold!   Our server was overwhelmed by a large table at the restaurant . We often felt like things took too long...like the food, the check and clearing out plates between servings.   Otherwise, we had a great experience and I look forward to going back.",

Waiter was super friendly and helpful without being overbearing! Drinks were strong and delicious!  We ordered the BHKC chop salad and a pasta dish- both were great, the salad was amazing! I loved the atmosphere and the quiet low-lights loungey feel!  Would come back here in a heartbeat!  We almost walked out without paying by accident! Because it's attached to a hotel, our server brought out the bill with the total, tip, and signature line. So (having had a drink or 2) we calculated the tip, signed, and got up to walk out. Only then did we realize we never have our credit card! Of course, we went back immediately, I would have felt terrible!! Yikes!",

Great selection of cocktails, beers and wine and was pleasantly surprised to see they gave Cava by the glass beside the usual champagne and Prosecco. Great service and cool atmosphere. Great for date night or funky place for lunch",

While my friends enjoyed some main entrees, after we ordered a few appetizers like Boudin balls and corn fries which were both very good, I ended up having for my meal just some sliders and small beat salad. Though the sliders were very small, I was amazed at how tough the meet was. The salad was very nicely done. All the meals well presented. I would go back.  As I look back at the menu, I am not sure I would call this a Gastropub. I will continue to look for funky food !",

Drinks:  1. lawless - amazing with when the tobacco-smoked glass! If you like bourbon, this is a must try. 2. old fashioned - nice use of the big orange rind, gave it a deeper taste.

Easy Open Table reservations before the Suns game made getting a table simple. Ordered the cheese, meat and fruit platter to start. Nice wide range of flavors with no stinky cheese. I shared the blackened salmon with my son and my husband got the port shank. Salmon was moist and flavorful. Green beans were perfect with it. Pork shank came right off the bone and mixed nicely with the beans and rice. For dessert the fruit crisp with vanilla ice cream. There were no left overs of anything! I had to  to take away a star because it was a bit overpriced. $115 for an appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 glass of wine and 1 dessert to share.",

    "text": "What a beautiful, sexy restaurant!  I came here on Friday night with my three dear friends for a much needed, relaxing dinner out.  We decided to use the 20% Yelp discount voucher I received the night before at the Summer Splash and Dash event, and as soon as we were seated I gave our waiter, Chris, my Yelp discount card.  We ordered drinks and I was a little overwhelmed by the large cocktail menu.  Not overwhelmed in a bad way, but overwhelmed in a good way...it was enormous!  My friends all ordered their own drinks and we placed an appetizer orders: the \"endless\" caramel popcorn with Ancho chilies, and half orders each of the tater tots and the seasoned Kennebec French fries.  The tater tots and fries were both hot and delicious and came with tangy dipping sauce.  The caramel popcorn was intriguing with its slightly spicy end note.  We really enjoyed the popcorn, but sadly while the menu description implied it was a refillable menu item, it wasn't refilled when we depleted the bowl and so we only got a very small serving.  After finishing our first cocktails we all placed our dinner orders, I ordered the large order of the Kobe beef short ribs with the blue cheese grits, my girlfriends both ordered flatbread pizzas and a salad and our lone male companion ordered the lamb meatballs.  We also ordered additional cocktails to go with dinner and I took the chance to order a drink the waiter recommended called a Bermuda Triangle, which was cold, fruity, tangy and massively potent too.  (Wow!)  Our dinners all trickled out at different times and us three ladies at the table had all been served for a full 15 minutes before we eventually grabbed the closest waiter in the vicinity, Justin, and had him check on our companion's missing lamb meatballs.  Justin happily obliged our request and disappeared into the kitchen only to reappear with the lamb meatballs in less than 30 seconds.  How long they were sitting there waiting to be delivered to our table was anyone's guess.  Sadly our own waiter wasn't aware of this hitch because he never came near our table that whole time.  I knew there was a problem though when the people who came in a full 30 minutes after we were seated had been served their food (including an order of lamb meatballs) and the three of us ladies had all been served and our friend was still waiting for his entree!  After everyone finally had their food we all started to eat and I wasn't at all disappointed with my Kobe beef ribs!  They were so generously sized I could only eat one, however the grits were utterly unremarkable and I basically ignored them in favor of that massive, meaty rib.  I also tasted the lamb meatballs and they were fabulous, although the hot pink sour cream they were served with was a bit oddly colored.  Not long after we finished eating our waiter reappeared and he volunteered to clear our table and package the second, untouched Kobe beef rib for me.  We also placed dessert orders and chatted while we waited for dessert to appear.  Oddly our desserts, including my Panna Cotta and my friend's seasonable sorbets, were all served with forks.  I had to ask the waiter for spoon instead.  My Panna Cotta was a tad too soft for my liking, but the pool of foamy citrus sauce it was sitting in was very good and deliciously tangy, although to be quite honest I could have done without the flavorless, unidentifiable curls that topped the Panna Cotta.  Seriously, I couldn't even identify what they were, they were that tasteless.  We paid our tab and tipped our waiter on the pre-discount amount.  (It should be noted that we would have tipped him more, but leaving us to sit for 15 minutes as our dinners cooled and we politely waited for our companion's missing dinner entree was no bueno!)  So all in all this was a pleasant dining experience and I expect will venture back soon, but next time I'd love to have more follow up from our waiter and I'd hope that all the entrees all arrive around the same time too.",

I ordered the Lawless cocktail... if you are a bourbon drinker this will knock your socks off. Bourbon, bitters and wormwood liqueur, poured into a glass filled with loose-leaf tobacco smoke at your table. It's a captivating presentation and really yummy.   It was a birthday celebration and they treated me very well!   Don't miss this one.",

The steak sandwich was probably the worse, so dry and it's slices of roasted beef rather than a steak. Even when more sauce doesn't really help. The best was the Brussels Sprouts that we almost got another round of it. Not much options on their menu either.",

    "text": "I can't really fault anything about our dinner experience here in terms of the quality of the food and drink and service. There was mixed feedback about the price of many of the menu options (including the steaks, which come a la carte) being above average in cost, but at the same time, you can also look at it as paying for a quality experience. I do feel, though, that the staff ooze just a wee bit too much pride about the place, as in spreading it a bit thick. I agree, but at the same time, I'd rather the food and drink speak for itself, or the reviews I read, and maybe a teeny bit by the wait staff. Please don't channel your inner car salesman.  So one thing about which they pride themselves is their cocktail list, in particular their varieties of old fashioneds, which is an instant win for me. I tried their \"A Joke and a Coke, but Classy\" which, at $15, competes with places like New York on cost, but it was justified, an complex blend of flavor with just enough sweetness that it would work as both a before and after-dinner drink.   We only ordered one appetizer, the focaccia, but even that had options for gluten restricted diets, such as the marinated cauliflower. Everything (except the bread) had a distinctive lemon flavoring, which was especially interesting with the baba ganoush. My entree, the Faroe Island Salmon, was cooked to absolute perfection, and again the roasted mushrooms complimented the meal.   The staff were really attentive (and persistently informative), but it was all good in terms of meal information, recommendations, etc.. It was a very enjoyable experience.",

She had to be told it was a reservation for 7pm and to check with her host before she came back again.  We all arrived at 7 to chat and get appetizers. Drinks were slow to arrive and dinner took almost 30 minutes to show up. They excuse was that the chicken was slowing down the entire dinner.  My carbonara was so cold I was embarrassed to ask for it to get microwaved.  My friends 8oz steak was a joke in terms of size and a bit of rabbit greens on the side .   Our waiter then needed bothered to split the check into 3 like he was asked and arrived with gratitude already applied (which he was entitled to) but he was smug in telling us about it as if he expected more tip. $460 later. Absolute joke.",

    "text": "What a lovely seating area on the patio with nice lights and the great skyline and City view. Nice ambiance for sure on the patio.  Server was very attentive and helpful... Food was served very quickly and efficiently.  Food: Cioppino was generous with seafood but broth was sparse, flat, not rich or sumptuous, like I've had at nice trattorias in California. Also it wasn't red, like I expected, but yellow and not plentiful. I had orgasmic cioppino before and this was not in any way close to what I have had before at the place I mentioned. I am not a cioppino snob or expert but just a plain person who expected something else and was disappointed in that sense.  The appetizers were great: burratta, chicharrones  My friend enjoyed his shank,I tried my husband's pesto pasta and my other friends shrimp and grits which I found tasty... Nothing mind blowing.  The cocktails OMG. They freaking served a kalamata Olive in both my friends martini... WHAT IN THE HELL. The server apologized that they ran out of the Spanish olives so they used that... That's embarrassing!! They claim to be a cocktail bar and then they do this?? Ok, rant over.  Let's just say the food was tasty overall and the view was really nice...but 250$ worth? Definitely not. You're paying for the swank, The view, the location (Like other downtown \"hip\" spots)  So my conclusions: glad I checked it off my list, wouldn't really bother to go again because nothing was mind blowing and wouldn't drop that same amount for \"not mind blowing\".",

I loved everything about this burger and highly recommend for all those coming here and debating on getting the burger, get the burger! Also, the fries were amazing-perfect crisp and flavors!

As soon as you walk in you see all the cool Christmas lights and decorations hanging from the ceiling. All of their holiday cocktails are served in different holiday themed mugs served up by their jolly bartenders who were also in Christmas wear.   Shout out to whoever crafted their cocktail menu! We tried most of the cocktails on the menu and they were surprisingly all VERY good. I think my personal favorite was either the old fashioned or the mai tai inspired yippie ki ya mother f***er. Be prepared to drop some serious cash on drinks here! The price for these cocktails is a bit too high in my opinion at 15-18 dollars a drink.   All in all the drinks and festive ambiance of this place is spectacular and if you don't mind the premium price tag on drinks, you should definitely check it out.",

Most if not all meals don't come with sides so for a 35-50 steak to have no side included and be expected to fork out another 8-10 dollars fir a kid size side is a bit much. I had the pasta and it was tasty and good but bucca de peppo and carrabas are better....just being honest. We had desert and to their credit they were also good but small and if sharing only expect a few bites between 2 people . The atmosphere itself is very nice in the cityscape location and the restaurant itself is very nice but quiet so expect that vibe and type of social environment. Would i go again maybe but knowing the cost and that i can enjoy the same type of meal for less it might be questionable.",

Beautiful lobby is attached to the restaurant and the bathrooms are perfect for that full length selfie!  The menu is modern American cuisine with fresh and exciting twists here and there. The drink menu is endless, I mean, where else can you go and order classics like a Sazerac, Whiskey Sour, or a Zombie AND order draft beers, wines, and mimosas? Happy Hour is M-F from 3-6pm, and it's $2 off all draft beers.  The food: you can't go wrong with the burger, the shrimp and grits, the mac and cheese with cheetos (OMG, so creative lol), Artisian meat and cheese board, the flat iron steak or the blackened salmon. I can't gush enough about the food!   I have been here a several times for dinner and drinks and the service is THE best, BAR NONE. It is pricey, but worth it! Just GOOOO!",

Our reserved time was from 7:30-9:30 in the evening. We got there a bit earlier at 7pm and they did not give us a hard time. They sat us in our reserved are and immediately brought our snacks and drinks and other orders.  They had Christmas themed drinks and food which I thought was absolutely clever. The fried turkey leg was my favorite. The bar tenders were all really great and knew how to make good strong drinks and they even gave the girls on my team all free shots!  They had a family bowl of peppermint drink which was delicious but it was a shareable drink with straws which would be weird for those people who aren't into that! Lol!  Next time this is back for the Christmas holidays it is definitely a great place to bring visitors and work outings. The drinks are $15 and up so be prepared to spend a good amount of money. It's all about the ambiance that makes it great.",

    "text": "Perfect spot for upscale post-work drinks downtown. I came here a week ago post-work/pre-DBacks game. The place was packed. They're located at the Hotel Palomar off to the left of the lounge area (where wine hour is served to hotel guests) They have an impressive selection of cocktails, all made with fresh local ingredients.  I particularly like their cocktail list for those who want something off the beaten path made with an obscure liquor. Highest marks for originality. I also really like their ice cubes which are slightly larger than your average ice cube and a bit rough. The bartenders are all very friendly but the service is a bit slow. Granted they were very busy so no complaints here other than I really wanted another drink and had to wait. I highly recommend this place especially if you want a casual yet classy place to grab a drink. Haven't sampled the food yet, but since I work just a few blocks away I'm sure I'll be a regular here before too long. Did I mention we ran into Drew Carey in the elevator? We were exiting to street level headed to Chase Field and got to share a ride with him to the lower level. Good times!",

The shishito peppers are fantastic, but so are the small farm cheeses, tater tots, and deviled eggs.  On a recommendation from our server the first time, I ordered the short ribs.  The meat just fell off the bone.  As much as I loved those, I tried the lamb meatballs the 2nd time there.  After the first bite, I was disappointed I didn't order the larger portion.  The service there was impressive and extremely helpful.  As a whisky drinker, my Brown Derby and Manhattan's were delightful.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went here for brunch for the first time with some friends and I was overall happy with the place. The hotel and place have a really cool decor (modern industrial), but in my opinion, the food was nothing special. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, but they had red beans in them and I finished it fine, but I was starving and it wasn't to die for by any means. My girlfriend got the egg Benedict, but I didn't try it. I asked her how it was and she said that it was \"good\", so, she didn't complain, but she didn't seem impressed either. They actually forgot one of our guests meals, which wasn't cool. We were pretty much done eating when he got his plate and they didn't offer to comp the meal or even provide a discount. We didn't ask because to us, it is a given, but they obviously didn't think so (or they forgot)... My friend got the chicken and waffles and I did have some of that. The waffles were soggy and the fried chicken was OK. Nothing compared to the real thing.  Let me get to the point: Should you go there or not? Well, as I mentioned before, the decor is really cool, which makes me think that it could be fun for a quick drink before you go somewhere else. I wouldn't recommend it for brunch, but I would be willing to try them out again for lunch or dinner.   FYI: Their unlimited mimosas and bloody marry's are priced at $13 during brunch, which isn't bad.",

Our server Chris was very well versed in the menu and gave some great recommendations! If you go you must try the biscuits, short rib, hamachi and for dessert get the pineapple upside down cake!

The wait staff was attentive and informative.  The menu has a wide variety.  And the food is delicious!  The downside to all of this is the cost.  I have never paid so much for so little.  The quality of the fare does not outweigh the sticker shock here.  The best I can do is give this a 3-star rating because of the pricing. 5 teeny-tiny tacos for $15?  And I do mean teeny-tiny.   The KFQuail is fantastic but you 3X more cornbread than quail.  And the gravy is outstanding.  But there is so little of it there (the quail, that is).  And at $17 no less.  Roasted beet salad and a roasted peach salad for $12 each?  There is barely a half-serving in each.  Don't go by their online menu either because it is out of date in regards to what is offered and what is being charged.  Nearly every item is at least $2 more than shown online.  The best value on the menu are the baby zucchini corn dogs.    5 small dishes, 2 drinks and tip left us $100 poorer.  Great food, lousy value.",

    "text": "Okay, I'm a bit shocked with all the rave reviews.  Are you all just so stoked that there's a hip new restaurant/bar in downtown?  For all you non-guests of Blue Hound, don't get all wet yet - here's the truth:  Drinks - happy hour is pretty decent I had the Summer Smash at it was tasty!  Loved it.  Food - Terrible!  My friend and I just got off work at 5:30 and were planning to head over to the Herberger Theatre for a 7:30 show.  We were hungry and excited to try a new spot.  Out of the recommendation of our waiter, we decided to have a few starters and share an entree.  Our waiter highly recommended the Tater Tots & Sopes.  The Taters are deep fried tots mixed with bacon and chive.  They were a bit salty and not as good as they sounded.  The Sopes were just terrible.  Imagine rubbery silver dollar sized Sopes with the worst tasting pork.  One bite is all it took and I wanted to vomit.  Onto the entree.  We decided to share the Mussels which took about 40 minutes to arrive at our table (no the waiter didn't mention how long it would take even though he knew we were planning to catch a show).  They were \"ok\", not out of this world.  It came with what was once toasted bread but I think when the toast is black, it's beyond toast, right?  Not impressed.  We left hungry and barely made it to our show at the Herberger.  Good news is the Herberger was serving up the most divine brownies that saved the evening!   The moral of this story is don't go hungry.  Food sucks but happy hour is pretty decent. It's perfect if you want to chill-lax with colleagues or friends.",

I'm rarely one to write off a restaurant after the first try, so we decided to come back and check it out for dinner. We had reservations and had to move the reservation due to a delay in babysitter, and they were super accomodating. Awesome! We started with the Zucchini corn dogs with green goddess dressing. This was a really cool, well done app. it was literally little pieces of zucchini on a stick in corn dog batter. Super whimsical and a great dish to snack on. wifey jsut had the cheese plate (we DID have a big lunch)  but not me. I saw braised pork neck and I was in. How's this sound. \"braised pork neck with hominy, pickled onions, avocado and grilled bread\"...if that didn't make your mouth water, I'm pretty sure somewhere you just killed a smurf. And the dish was just as awesome as it sounded. It came in a litle cast iron skillet with a bit of broth. Just super tender meat, great flavor and a melange of textures. I can not wait to go back and get it again, it's the best dish I've had in Phx in a while. We also had a great server, super attentive and on point. all in all, i can easily say that Blue Hound has redeemed itself.",

    "text": "Downtown Phoenix is certainly in need of trendy restaurants like the Blue Hound. It has an industrial meets urban-chic-trendy type of atmosphere. There are chandeliers in cages, plank floors and rustic wood tables - and it all works nicely together. That said, there is nothing to help absorb sound so it can get quite loud quickly and difficult to carry on a conversation in a normal tone of voice.  The service was excellent so whatever kinks other reviewers have mentioned were certainly not apparent the evening we were there. Our servers was extremely knowledgable about the menu items, but also about the cocktails. She was attentive but didn't smother us, and she wanted to make sure we were happy with what we ordered.  Some have described the menu as \"southern\" cuisine, which I don't get. Just because there are grits on the menu doesn't make it southern. The menu is innovative and creative - perhaps a bit too much so.   The food we had was good - but be prepared for very small portions overall, and fairly high prices. We started out with the pulled pork sliders on a white corn johnnycake. The pork was extremely flavorful but the johnnycake just wasn't substantial to support it. These sliders have to be eaten with a fork, and the pork fell off the johnnycake so it was difficult to get both the pork and cake in one bite. Entrees: the mac & cheese ($11) came in a very small cast iron cassoulet. Good, but more appetizer size than entree. Again, the portion size of the Alaskan Cod was small. Nicely presented, but it looked very lonely on the plate. The Plum Tomato flatbread was unispiring, lacking character and flavor. Very little basil. Steer clear of that option. The best entree was the Porterhouse Pork Chop. This was a good-sized portion, cooked perfectly and the confit was excellent. Desserts: the Sticky Toffee bread pudding with bacon ice cream was dry and not flavorful - very disappointing. The Carmelized Pineapple Upside Down cake was excellent.  The food was good - not outstanding - and high priced for the portion size. Great place for visitors to the Valley, and maybe business lunches. Glad we tried it but I doubt if we'll return. We just weren't that impressed.",

We stumbled upon Blue Hound by accident and boy was it a happy accident! We started with the fried green tomatoes and added the crab to it. Do it. Always add the crab! The crab was so fresh and tasty. The breading on the tomatoes was perfectly crisp and a lovely texture. Such a delicious appetizer! We then had the shrimp and grits. Let me tell you, they were phenomenal! I was taken right back to Tennessee with this dish! The grits were perfectly creamy, the sauce I could drink, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly! I can not wait to get back and try more dishes. The sous chef, Logan who created our dish so graciously came out to accept our praise on an amazing job well done! He was all but embarrassed when we couldn't stop gushing about the food! Do not leave without getting the chocolate pudding! It's a perfect marriage of thick, rich chocolate mousse on top a graham cracker crust then topped with a marshmallow swirl. The swirl is then torched to give it a bit of a burnt, meringue feel. The description does not do it justice.  Our waiter, Chris W was fantastic! When you go ask for him! Friendly and so knowledgable about the menu!",

    "text": "I'm only going to review the breakfast because that was the only meal we ate here. We ate breakfast twice.   Stayed at the hotel a couple of nights and this place was most convenient for breakfast without leaving the hotel. It's a little pricey for breakfast but it's a nice treat when you're on vacation. It's on the 2nd floor of the Hotel Palomar Cityscape.   It's quiet, not many people were eating and the server was wonderful. Eggs benedict was great (generous hollandaise sauce), so was denver omelet and regular fried eggs if you want a hot breakfast. I liked the bagels and smoked salmon if you're into a cold plate. Coffee was strong, orange juice was fresh squeezed and the morning ambience was quiet and relaxed. We sat near the window and watched the city wake up. I have no complaints about the food or service.   We'll probably try dinner here one day soon. Hopefully it's as great as breakfast.",

My husband and I got the Partner in Dine meal special which consists of 2 small appetizers, a sandwich and a salad. I highly recommend this meal special if it's your first time.

We ordered the tater tots and deviled eggs to start. The tots were so good, we wished we ordered the larger size. They had bits of bacon in them and to be honest, they were a bit of a salt bomb but in a really good way. The deviled eggs were delicious and creamy and some of my favorites I've ever had. For dinner we split the pork belly flat bread/pizza thingy. YUM -the caramelized onions with the salt bite from the pork - it was delicious. I would definitely go back here again for drinks and most certainly for the food!",

    "text": "I have been to Blue Hound five times now, once just for cocktails and four times to eat dinner, so I figured it was time to review it.  I really want to like the Blue Hound, and I know people that do like it, but it has three big problems.  1) The service is too slow  2) it takes itself WAY too seriously (which leads back to #1) and 3) the plates are USUALLY tiny for the price (and there is too much variation in sizes between similarly priced items, so you never know what you're going to get.   Let me expound.  I have no problem with hipsters.  I live downtown, it comes with the territory.  I like the buzzwords \"crafted\", \"local\", and the such.  That said...  The Blue Hound has good cocktails.  Good, very expensive, very slow to arrive cocktails.  The ingredients are quality and the drinks are inventive, but $10-$15 is just too much.  I also would rather get mine quickly than watch your bartender painstakingly shave off the Mona Lisa of ice cubes and perform other elaborate rituals.  Also, and the food suffers from this too, the description of the drink is way too preciously obtuse to actually divine what is in it.  Here's an example: last night Sweet Pea ordered something called Thirstn Howl (pardon my spelling.)  It listed the ingredients, and one of them was something called banane something or other that nobody has ever heard of before.  So, you expect it to have banana.  This thing came out and it was a banana milkshake.  The food, well- the food.  Again, I'm a vegetarian, so take that for what it is.  Blue Hound doesn't have a True veg entree, but they have a lot of veg options in their small plates.  I believe that one time when I was there, they did have a veg entree, a risotto or something, but that has somehow fallen by the wayside.  I would like to see it come back.  Anyway, the problem with the veg plates is that they are too small for a single person to eat one for dinner (and I don't eat a lot), so you have to order a couple. And then the variation between plate sizes is all over the map, so you have to either ask your server or you have to cross your fingers. The time before last that I went there, I asked my server if the Panzanella salad was enough for me as my only food for dinner.  He said oh yes!  It came out, and it was a very small bowl filled with 98% hard, tasteless croutons.  The \"artichoke, fava beans, burnt baby leeks?\"  Again- it is hard to tell what it's going to be from that description, but there were 3 small pieces of each.    Last time I was there, I tried the roasted cauliflower based on good Yelp comments, and the collard greens salad (because I love collard greens), and I have to admit- they were my favorite things I've had there.  Although, the collard green salad was VERY salty, and both were too oily (which is something that I find in general with BH's food.)  The two of them together were enough for me for dinner, but as I said- the plates there are small.  And pricey.  And all over the place in terms of relative size, and you can't tell what you're going to get.    I've been with a lot of people and seen a lot of different things ordered.  Lots of people get the ribs and like the ribs, and that's a big plate. Unfortunately, last time we were there, Sweet Pea (a notorious carnivore and lover of meat) got the ribs and said that he felt sick all the next day, and they were just \"OK.\"  He asked for extra blue cheese on the grits and got a \"well...I can ask...\" from the server.  When it came out, there was a big production of saying \"with the EXTRA blue cheese\", but Sweet Pea said he couldn't taste it, and the grits were very bland (I heard that from too others that ordered the same on the same night also.)  I've also seen someone order the scallops, which came up strangely lined up with no accoutrement on the very outer edge of a very large, oval plate, which only emphasized how little food she was getting for $20.  The food comes out VERY slow.    Service:  I've seen no earlier than 45 minutes and as long as 1.5 hours to get the food.  That's kind of a bummer.  It would be better if my cocktails were quicker to arrive and not so costly.  Anyway, I think I'm done with the Blue Hound.  I really really REALLY wanted to like it.",

We had a birthday (not mine) outing here, and I have many good things to say! Strong cocktails! Intriguing flavors! Moody and inviting setting! Our waiter did forget to grab drink orders from the last 2 (of 9) people at our table - one of us had a half drink so maybe he was misled. He made up for the lapse with anecdotes and consistently attentive service thereafter.   We were in a corner, which we filled with laughter, and it was loud but not so loud that (being in the middle) I couldn't turn and hear what the other end of the table was chatting about.  There was something for everyone on the menu, even shortribs served on the bone, in a bowl, over tasty sides (for the Viking/Caveman in you). I had the risotto - full of flavor - and the olives and bottomless popcorn were big hits... but the tacos, the tacos! It was the only sign of sadness from our group, that the full order of tacos wasn't really a meal, but more of a tapas plate.  Oh, and water carafes should probably just have been left at the table. It's shwank to fill a glass halfway from a glass bottle, but for those of us who work in the Arizona heat and rely on rehydrating in the evening... waiting for water to arrive (again) is anything but neat-o.  BUT! before you're done, save room for a digestif up at the rooftop bar. It's lovely, too.",

I have to say--that after you find the place--the look of the space is wonderful and I could see sitting and having a drink--but for the money I will go someplace else.

I had the scallops and they were just okay--but certainly not worth the price.  on to the service--to many servers too much time --at one point there were five people providing service and at other times you could have bowled in the place and not hit a server--service was off and on and did not lend anything to the meal.  i probably won't be back--there are so many other places to go --that have really good food, great service and prices that don't make you feel liked someone just picked your pocket.",

First observation is that the hotel lobby (which is the way I opted to enter the restaurant - I did not notice the exterior door) is probably the most unimpressive that I have ever seen. You struggle for a moment to get your bearings - then you catch sight of the venue.  Place is sort of hip - but it fails in my mind to convey an ambiance where you would be inclined to spend 3 to 4 hours of your evening \"soaking\" it up. Has more of a \"grab a drink and find the next place\" feel. Once I got by that, I settled in and enjoyed the food.  Menu is limited and it tries a little too hard to be cool. Food we had was good but not memorable.  It is one of the many new eateries in the general Phoenix downtown area, specifically the City Scape area. It will likely fair well simply because of the proximity to the Kimpton Palomar Hotel - convenience will be its underpinning.  Will be back to give it another try. Maybe happy hour.",

    "text": "I agree with some of my fellow Yelpers that have stated that this place still needs a little work.  I came here with 4 other people on a Saturday night and it was packed, which is always a good thing to see.  We got seated and glanced over the menu.  Our waiter came over and poured us water while we looked over the wine list.  His first mistake was that he didn't fill up our glasses of water all the way and didn't come back right away to refill the water glasses.  We ordered a bottle of wine and while we waited for it, the manager came over and told us that we would have to wait a little longer because they didn't have the particular wine we ordered chilled.  I guess that is not a big deal but we should have been asked if we wanted more water or a different kind of beverage.  We ordered some appetizers and still looked over the menu for our entrees.  The menu is not overly extensive and it really appeals to someone that likes to try new and inventive foods together. The tater tots we ordered were really good.  I would totally recommend that.  Finally our bottle of wine arrived after being chilled for about 15 minutes.  The dinner portions are really big.  I had the flat bread pizza, my sister had the sliders, and my bf had a fish dish.  The flavors were all really good.  Our waiter really didn't check up on us.  He maybe came over once in the entire time that we were in process from the appetizers to the entrees.  At this point we had ordered another bottle of wine and were enjoying the food and the conversation.    We stayed a long time and also ordered dessert which we had to order from the manager because our original waiter was not anywhere to be seen.  The desserts were great but I would recommend to order one and share as it was enough to share with 4 people.  As we were ready to get our check, the waiter magically appeared and left us with our bill.  We had a $300 credit from an event we had held there earlier and our will was a little over $300.  The waiter acted like we were not going to live a tip based on the entire bill because he was hovering over us as we were paying the bill and stood there and looked at us until we got up to leave.    All in all the food is good.  I think it is a place you can go once but it would not be on my list of places to return to.  I would definitely work on the service and make sure the waiters know what they are doing and make sure they are attentive.  The food can be the best but the service is what makes a customer want to return to have the delicious food.",

We stayed at the Palomar hotel for the second time and last time we stayed, we ate quickly on our way to the comedy club across the street.  The hush puppies, tater tots and pineapple upside down cake made an impression.  This time, we chose to do the chef's tasting menu.  They serve four courses with two paired drinks.  All four courses were stellar and we are pretty discerning diners.  Our only complaint is that we didn't get a glass of wine as one of our drinks.  We were served two very interesting cocktails, but the second was like straight bourbon.  We would have enjoyed a nice glass of wine with dinner.  Ryan was an awesome server!  We will be back.",

    "text": "This place has 5 star potential, but the service brought it down to 4. A friend and I sat at the bar for happy hour here at what was fated to be a tour of sliders in downtown... but that part of the story comes later. The place was busy, as I imagine it is typically for happy hour. Their happy hour drink menu leaves much to be desired... it only has 4 simple cocktails that don't really show off what this place is all about (elaborate and creative cocktails). We both tried the Tea cocktail that was on special for 6$. It was alright, very strong tea flavor which covered the vodka taste very well... in fact, it didn't taste much like alcohol at all... oh, but it had alcohol. These puppies were strong (haha unintentional pun), and both of us felt it. Here is when the problem arose. We sat at the bar for another 30-40 minutes and couldn't get the attention of any of the bartenders. We tried making eye contact to no avail. We really wanted to order food and I wanted to get another drink. Finally, about 1 minute before happy hour ended we slid in an order of happy hour sliders (heh) and I got a caribe drink of sorts (it had tequila, pineapple, other delish things...). The food and drink got to us quickly, so we were happy. I must say, the sliders were some of the most delicious sliders I have ever tasted... the pork belly was perfectly cooked and not overly fatty, they were delicate and all of the flavors worked together (pork, kimchi, hawaiian roll.... pure bliss). Oh ya, my drink was good too. So my tip is... do come for happy hour, get the snacks, but skip the weak happy hour drink specials and cough up the dough for one of their specialty drinks. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I keep coming back here and trying to like it more, but this place has lost so much character. It has SO much potential. The atmosphere is of a place nowhere in phoenix without even trying. The cocktails are fabulous and the food is great. However, there always feels like there's something missing. Like the place is doing just enough to get by. On the past two or three occasions I've come here, the service has been so disappointing. Mostly from the bartenders. They make an awesome drink! And that's it. No conversation, no upselling, no intrigue, nothing that makes you feel like they enjoy being part of the staff. The whole ambience is lost on them. I remember coming in years ago with a group of my friends on my birthday, we were the last and only group and we had a spectacular bartender who roused us with great drinks and fabulous storytelling/conversation. He was handsome, charming, funny, and welcoming. I never see that anymore. On Friday night, we were glanced over, unattended and brushed off, and just not engaged. The whole air inside is that no one cares. I truly think if this place wasn't attached to the palomar, it'd have closed down long ago. It pains me to think that because Blue Hound has so much potential! Its hip, its cool, it's delicious! It just lacks charisma and energy. Any time a place like this is empty on a friday night, that's a sign.",

My first time in was for lunch. I went big and ordered the $16 bacon cheeseburger w a fried egg. It was incredible. The seasoning in the mince and contrasting consistencies between the crispy bacon and gooey egg was a nice combination. We arrived at 1130 to 4-6 tables occupied and left close to 1p with every chair/stool sat in. Parking wasnt easy but was not difficult  My second time was the following week on a Friday night. I wanted to see what the late happy hour, weekend dinner crowd would be like. I was a bit disappointed in the patrons that were there (7p-10p) as it was an older crowd and the environment did not keep up with the potential of the space. I dont know how much of that can be blamed to the restaurant or hotel - unless the marketing budget can increased or the campaign can be redirected. It made me second guess whether this would be my new dinner/hh spot in downtown, or if I would just continue to frequent the central phx/arcadia gems. Parking was horrendous  The dinner ws extravagant - cheddar scallion biscuits with quail eggs and bacon jam (best part was the egg, not worth $9 for two of these bite sized suckers). Kale caesar salad (wouldnt do it again). And chicken friend Quail over foie gras biscuit - enjoyed it but would try something else next time. I actually text my buddy in the middle of the meal, who introduced me to the restaurant, that i enjoyed lunch much more than dinner.  I'd realistically give it another shot for dinner, but unfortunately if it is just lackluster again (by flavor and ambiance), i doubt i'll be there often because it is not in the vicinty of my office for lunch.",

Our server was incredibly helpful in recommending drinks (I chose The Darkness and would absolutely order it again). We started with the endless butterscotch chile popcorn (because how could you not?), and had a hard time selecting entrees because they all looked so delicious. I chose a half order of the beef short ribs with grits and a side of french fries, and my friend opted for a shot (yes, they offer shots, cups, and bowls of soup--genius) of their yummy cauliflower soup and a half order of the pork belly. I enjoyed both of our choices immensely, and next time I will think ahead and not fill up on the popcorn to save room for dessert.  I will definitely be returning. The great service and food was well worth it. The only advice I can give is to park underground at Cityscape (they will validate in the restaurant), and make sure you go to the second floor to find the restaurant.",

We walked in to eat dinner and we said hi can we get a table for two.  the first thing the manager says is do you have a reservation. In a very rude way. I said \"no, it doesn't look like we need one there is open tables everywhere\" mind you there were tables that said reserved I understand that but the 12 other ones no one was sitting at I didn't think the comment was needed. So then she proceeds to say let me look at what I have available. She suggests the bar, or outside. We say outside is fine, as she's walking us outside she says btw these tables are communal so don't be surprised if someone sits next to you. We said that's fine. The reason I'm writing this is because I want whoever is in charge to recognize their customer service was shit. Rude attitude to sit us, all to be told anyway anyone can sit next to you with a whole empty patio. Instead of making it a hassle in the beginning just say yes we have a table not trying to be pretentious and say oh do you have a reservation. Food was good, reasonably priced. But for the attitude it wasn't as great as the manger thinks",

It's attached to the dog-friendly Palomar hotel, so I believe you can bring your dog here, but I haven't tested it out yet. Their drinks are great and they use the huge cubes of ice in their whiskey. They also have a huge selection of whiskey, so you should definitely check it out. This place is like American tapas.

There were about 6 small plates with meat and 6 vegetarian.  I admit I don't have a \"sophisticated\" palate and that I am not a gourmet diner.  Nothing on the menu really spoke to me, or the rest of the group.  We ordered a full size dinner of beef stroganoff and the small plates of pork bellied sliders, tater tots, and grilled peppers.  I'm giving the 3 stars because one in the group really liked all three small plates.  The rest of us just liked the hash browns.  The stroganoff was super mushroom-y and not at all beef-y so if you like it that way it is for you.  The peppers were super hot and something in the sauce really upset my stomach and I could hardly eat anything else.   Add having to wait a while to be seated even with a reservation, a long wait to be greeted by the waitress, and then drinks taking a while to come-I'm just not a fan.  Not a bad place-great location and nice patio.  I just don't see myself coming back.",

Brought family from out of town to my Fav place.  went to the roof top pool area and had beverages, great fun. then down to the Blue Hound for more bevs, coffee and dessert, it was 8:30pm, no people waiting in the lobby, full bar area, 1 table on the patio and maybe 50% full in the dinning room. (waiters standing around) we were told we could only sit at a table in the DR or Patio if we all had full meals. ok so we saw 1 booth empty, in the bar area and walked over...as we began to sit the hostess came over and said this was a Dinner table and we could not sit here.  So back to the front area and we were told we could sit out in the lobby but there was no service there.  After being in the hospitality industry myself for over 35 yrs. I was amazed that we were being turned away....by this time it was almost 9pm....I sure hope they got a mad rush for dinner at that hour........we left and will not come back.  This was my birthday place for the last 3 yrs and I take everyone that comes to Phx to this place......but no more.

    "text": "When I saw the name of this establishment, Blue Hound, I couldn't help but thing of the paintings of George Rodrigue, who is from Louisiana and in fact, this downtown based eatery has a distinctive New Orleans feel with its focus on cocktails (according to drinking lore the Big Easy is where the first cocktail, the Sazerac, was reportedly developed), and its Southern friendly food such as bone-in Kobe beef short ribs and grits and Kentucky fried quail with cornbread, red beans and gravy. At the same time the decor and the initial impression was like walking into a bar as good as any as one might find in New York City, this place has cool atmosphere in spades and just for that it is worth a visit.  I was going to to the opera (for the first time, yep, an opera virgin, who would have thought!) with some friends so we picked this place to eat at first. I had ridden the light rail from Tempe and you get off the stop at Washington and Central and literally, you are right there, so this place is extremely light rail friendly. You go to the building on the corner of Jefferson and Central and up to the 2nd floor, turn to your right and you are there! The opening leads into a long bar and the best part of this place, which is the cocktails. They must have a cocktail ice machine because the ice cubes are huge and perfect for drinks like the old fashioned as they keep the liquor cold but don't water down the drink and the old fashioned, I got it for the happy hour price of $6 and that is great deal. They have a whole book of cocktails and I haven't seen anything like this since I was in San Francisco earlier this year, which is sort of a cocktail renaissance mecca.  From what I saw Blue Hound can hold its own. If you just want to come for cocktails - 5 starts  Dinner, well, they seem to be trying but needs some work. It was noted that we needed to get the opera by 7:30 but the waiter seemed a bit aimless at times relative to keeping us on schedule and one of my dining companions was quite concerned that we would not have time to finis the meal. Luckily, there was a wonderful young lady who checked on us, and got our orders taken so that helped keep things running smoothly. For an appetizer, we had the duck confit flat-bread which came out wonderful hot and topped with arugula and green apple diced through a mandolin, it was delicious though two of my dining companions felt it needed more confit.   We then did a salad and vegetable and i had a small dish of roasted cauliflower with pistachios, capers, and brown butter, and I thought it was quite good though I would have liked the cauliflower a little more roasted but nice - at this point, a solid 4 stars.   As for the meals, three of us ordered the Kentucky fried quail and while it was okay, it did not come hot, the fried quail was room temperature, the gravy was not all that warm and the cornbread, almost cold and it was little bland. It was the blah part of my meal. Another person had scallops and though large and cooked perfectly she noted they needed some sort of sauce, also a bland dish. Finally, one person got the Kobe bone in rib, the half order, with the blue cheese grits, now that came out hot and it was good - so at this point - because of the slower than expected service from the primary waiter, and the fact that the main dish was blah - the overall agreement by my group of five (mixed group, men and women), was a solid 3 stars though if you just came for cocktails and appetizers (and they have a good list of starters) then we would rate it a solid 4 starts with 5 star potentials if they work on the operational workflow of the kitchen to get the food out hot.  Oh, one final point, I could not figure out how to work  the salt and pepper shakers, the waiters might want to point out how those work. Bottom line, I probably won't go back for a full meal here but I will come back in a heartbeat for the wonderful cocktail and drink selection and the small plates, which may be the way to go. In my mind, this is about the closest  thing to a cool cocktail bar, like you might find in New York or San Francisco, that one is going to find and the location off of the light rail and big events in downtown Phoenix can't be beat and yes, I'm already looking forward to my next old fashioned at the bar!",

We planned to get a few drinks at the bar. There was no seating so we stood at this stand up area. No one bother to stop by and take our order, or even greet us. Our table was ready within about 20 minutes. After we were seated, our waiter took a good five minutes to stop by and introduce himself. The entire meal it seemed like we were a bothersome afterthought. Ordered the bacon oysters for an app. Yum!!!! I had the tagliatelle and my bf had the short ribs. Both were extremely under seasoned and my tagliatelle was super dry. Not a fan.",

The price point is exactly what you would expect for a restaurant of this caliber. You must make a reservation, we arrived around 7:30 pm on a Wednesday and they weren't able to seat us until after 8:30 pm. Lucky for us, there were two spots open at the bar. The staff is a very good looking bunch and have great attitudes!   Appetizer: CORN GRIT FRIES smoked bacon, white cheddar, pomodoro - these were beyond amazing! They were basically like a mozzarella stick filled with yumminess!  Entree: PAPPARDELLE schreiner's sausage ragu - their pasta is phenomenal to say the least. This was a delicious place.   I will DEFINITELY go back to Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails to enjoy more of what they have to offer!!",

    "text": "This place is ridiculous. I was in town for a weekend getaway with a friend and our hotel (downstairs) recommended a drink here. I guess the concept is love or hate and I fall into the latter category -- the previous reviewer who likened it to liquor roulette is right on target. Upon arrival, the hostess seemed confused about what we were there for. \"Just a couple of drinks at the bar\" shouldn't be too difficult to decipher. She asked us if we had a reservation. \"For drinks? No...\" We ended up on these massive high-tops in the middle of the front room and it took us a few minutes to procure a drink menu.   We couldn't really see the menu to begin with but once we repositioned and used our phone lights we managed to make it out. It felt like a Cheesecake Factory menu -- giant, laminated, (ironic?) stock photo looking. And of course, there is ZERO explanation of what is in each drink. We just stared at the prices, origin of the drinks, and ridiculous looking photos. For $17 I want to know what kind of liquor I'm \"gambling\" with. After many questions and much deliberation with the waitress, my friend settled on a tiki drink she had not tried before. We're both fans of a traditional Daiquiri and Mai Tai (and I'm partial to Navy Grog) so we thought we couldn't go wrong. And yet...  Her drink was \"special.\" At least the luxardos (three in total and that accounts for the only positive experience in this place) almost made up for the weird bitterness of the drink. I went a different route after asking our server for a gin-based recommendation. Her response was \"we only serve gin...no vodka\" which is fine, given that I asked for a gin-based recommendation. She gave me one and I agreed. Her description made it sound light and refreshing. When my stupidly expensive drink showed up 15 minutes later I could smell it before it even hit the table. Took a sip and immediately coughed at the peaty smokiness and unmistakably NOT GIN drink. Laphroaig. How do you confuse Laphroaig with gin? Or why would you even try to guess or make up ingredients if you have no idea? By the time all was said and the slow service was done, all we could do was laugh at the gimmicky menu and the childish looking photos. When I checked out of the hotel and saw the $44 charge for two drinks, I wasn't laughing anymore.",

The strange part was, while we were told it would be an hour wait, there were tons of empty tables, that remained empty the entire time.   Upscale and young crowd - lots of black leggings. I felt kind of old and out of place. Service was attentive, but not overbearing. Food was excellent (I had the trout). Prices are not cheap. But under $200 for 3 with apps, cocktails, dessert.

We stepped in and waited...and waited...staff looked at us and kept walking, as if we weren't hip enough to breathe the air in such an establishment.   Don't make eye contact with customers who have just entered and then walk away. That's customer service you should have picked up at whatever previous jobs allowed you to land here.   \"Maybe it's closing\", I muttered, looking at the hours posted on Yelp. \"They're still douchebags here.\"  Just before we were about to leave, your mustachioed mixologist from Michoacan swooped in to completely redeem this trendy bar. I am a gin man, not a whiskey guy, so I was totally lost regarding what to order. Good thing this is a bartender I can trust, I thoroughly enjoyed every sip of the \"Ours is the fury\" (strange name) that he recommended for my sweet tooth. I would have certainly tried more, but be careful! These are strong! It was a Monday night, and I had stuff to do in the morning.  But I'll be back, and I'm going to try several styles of whiskey. And recommend this place to my more manly, whiskey-loving friends. I find myself going out for a cocktail quite often nowadays. Between quality liquor and woody, classy decor, Blue hound totally deserves to see more of my business.  Oh, and there's food, too. I'll update you when I give that a try as well.",

Since we didn't have a reservation we were told that nothing was available till later. We were ok with that after all it's busy and we weren't expecting anything.  Shortly a nice young hostess approached me and said that if we were ok with sitting at the lounge she would have someone come and take our order.  Wow!  She made such a great impression on us. I thought I would try the restaurant again.  We were celebrating a birthday and a wedding anniversary.  Pleasant greeting from the hostess. We enjoyed several drinks, appetizers and dinner.  I have been living in Phoenix for 2 years now and I must say the entire experience from the ambiance, quality of service and the meal was outstanding!!  Being from Chicago it's been quite disappointing to find a restaurant that measures up.  Well I have found my happy place. Our server was incredible and he made the evening memorable.  He served us with a smile and genuine care. Thank you for making my guests and I valued and appreciated!  Please share with the staff our gratitude!",

On our first night, our flight was delayed so by the time we were arrived in Phoenix, we were starving and ready for a drink.  Yelpers, you did not fail me!!! Even though Sedona was two hours away from Phoenix, we ended up staying 3 to 4 hours at Blue Hound because we were having so much fun that we lost track of time.   Along with my hand made pasta dinner, I ordered a drink off the whiskey menu that I can't remember (yes that's how good the night was), the Lawless, and a dram of Yamasaki.  The bartender, Jimmy, made my friend one of his very own signature drinks that he called a daiquiri but tasted nothing like the froufrou drink we commonly know.   We enjoyed it so much that we returned to the Blue Hound on our way home from Phoenix. On our second visit, our bartender Kayla made me a gin + lavender drink accompanied with her handmade rosemary-berry ice cube. Even the popcorn was yummy!   If you go on a weeknight you might even see some regulars such as Kevin....",

    "text": "I was really excited when I read the reviews from the other Yelpers about this restaurants.  When I arrived I was really impressed with how nice it looked.  The bar isn't large or the restaurant in general isn't that big,  but it seems pretty lively.    Nice big windows which are probably really nice to sit next to on a Friday and Saturday night when there are people out and about. We were greeted graciously by the hostess and seated quickly.  Our server was also very nice.  We ordered the tater tots, just a half order.  I loved those and the half order was more than enough for my husband and I to share.  Then we  had the sopes.  I love pork belly, so was really excited about trying them.  They were a little on the heavy side.  Next we tried the biscuits.  If you like bacon and eggs, then you will like this dish.  I feel like the quail eggs were a little overcooked.  We decided to share the Short Rib.  It was huge!  I was really excited to try the grits that came with it too.  But then we bit into it.  It was pure fat!  I don't mind a little fat if it rendered properly, but it wasn't.  So my husband cuts on the other side of the rib and we still couldn't find any actual meat.  Not that it mattered since biting into the fat already turned my stomach.  The server offered to cook it longer or bring another, but we had lost our appetite.  When the server brought us the bill he said that the manager took 10% off the top of our tab, which was about $3.50.  That's not going to work.  We asked to speak to the manager and when he came to speak to us he removed the short rib off our tab. I think this place is going to be great in a couple of months.  The menu is pretty creative and I would like to return and try some other dishes one day.  Great place to go if you like bacon, which I do.  Next time I will probably try the crudo dish or a salad.  I little acid would go great with the heavier dishes.",

I don't know if i would recommend this spot with other restaurants near that are fantastic like Arrogant Butcher or Hanny's. Maybe just not my cup of tea. Also i have only gone at lunch time so maybe the food is different at night but just my thought. Its a great location downtown and good atmosphere.",

He was clearly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food he was serving.   Each dish was delicious and interesting. The shrimp with creamy grits sets the standard for this somewhat trendy dish. I will have a hard time ordering it any where else now! The beet salad with dates was beautiful and we'll composed in nice bite size pieces that made it easy to get all the flavors in one bite, a detail often overlooked when form takes precedence over flavor.   We will go back soon to try the many other dishes we wished we had room for!  Great job Blue Hound. A howling good eatery!",

It was not busy at all, yet it took her 10 min to make us 4 mimosas and another 5 minutes for a bloody, because she was busy cleaning other glassware right in front of us.   Food took 35-40 minutes to get to us and was absolutely pathetic portion size wise and wasn't even that good! She never asked us how anything was and we all left there still hungry (and broke).   We were never offered refills on our \"bottomless mimosas\", had to ask every single time.  The only silver living is that a manager or just other co worker came over to us and was friendly and accommodating, since our check was wrong. I would never come back here ever again. There are so many other amazing places, especially for breakfast near this place. Don't waste your time or money!",

You will BARK about having a great meal here if you share a bunch of small plates. Many of the plates come in small or regular sizes. The prices are very reasonable with one of the small plates starting at just $3.  We started with these really great Sazerac CockTAILS. They were so good we couldn't help not to LAP them up. It was outstanding and a very strong $10. drink.  Who doesn't like to WOLF down Blistered Miso Shishito Peppers and a small size Small Family Farmed Cheese Plate served at the perfect eating temperature with very tasty house made saltines.  The Elote Style Corn was so fresh and was something to HOWEL about. The corn tasted like fresh corn you'd get from a farmers market and found out if did come from local McClendons Farm.  Another TAIL WAGGER is the Jerk Cured Scottish Salmon. The flavor of the potato complemented the jerk seasoning with the salmon that was truly unique.  The Kimchi Pork Belly Siders might give some people a new LEASH on life. They make you a little nuts because they have peanuts on them.  We ended the meal sharing one Massive BBQ'd Beef Rib over Blue Cheese Grits. I feel like a HEAL saying this but it didn't say on the menu that it would be topped with a pickle fruit. It came out with pickled peached and I didn't mean to pick a BONE with anyone but we had to send it back since my husband has a peach allergy. LICK-ity split the Chef sent out another and graciously apologized for not noting that on the menu. The Short Rib really was the most MASTER-ful Rib I ever had anywhere. Not only was it caramelized meaty and succulent. it also had this chewy leather meaty coating around it that was awesome with those great BBQ smokey flavors. I usually don't eat ribs because they are too fatty for me as this one was in places for me and I note for other people it might be too fatty but for some people this is bliss and what they are looking for. The top or curved part of the rib is the less fatty part and I could eat from there and what I ate from there I really enjoyed and can appreciate how good it really was. The Blue Cheese grits really went well with the rib and were really great. It's a shame I had to pass on the picked peaches.  I felt like CHASING the waiter down for one of those interesting desserts that they have here but when he presented the dessert menu I just had to MUTT-er I was too full to cram in dessert and had to take a WALK.  I don't mean to be a little RUFF but Blue Hound Kitchen and CockTAILs might leave you STAY Hot under the COLLAR in a Good Way.  1-15-2015 Chef has changed since my visit.",

    "text": "The bottom line with discretionary spending, which eating out represents, is value. We don't indulge in this luxury a lot. So each experience matters. The Blue Hound offers real value. We enthusiastically recommend Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails. Here's why.  My wife and I recently took our dear friends and neighbors to the Blue Hound to celebrate a birthday. They had never been there. We will all be back (no surprise to us). A thank you call the next morning said: \"Dave had a grand time last night!\" That was the point.  As always, the food was outstanding in all respects: presentation, taste, value, and service. To the latter point, our server was Ryan. He does a superb job of making his guests welcome, with just the right balance of politeness, knowledge, attention without being overbearing, and sensitivity to the mood of the experience. He clearly knows and respects the quality offered from the kitchen and the bar and that made us comfortable with each of us customizing our orders. Yes, we all had different entrees and they were outstanding.  A real experience for the guys was the amazing Lawless cocktail. Ryan put us on to it and we just had to try it. Astounding! Just that would be worth a visit to the Blue Hound.   We went early on a Sunday evening--a good choice if you want a quieter, more low-key experience. Noise levels were non-existent and, of course, the staff's attention was more easily obtained. But we have been there during quite busy times and the quality of their offerings did not suffer in the least. Noise levels are up then, as they are in most restaurants at such times.  One of our friends is a design professional; his wife is a design genius. My wife and I are neither, but we have over 50 years of experience in creating a contemporary living environment. One of the things that made our friends' first experience here so special is the exceptional attention to design detail in the space; the use of wood, metal, glass and lighting all combine to indicate that someone really cared to make this space so inviting.  Parking is validated; a convenience. Total cost: $3!",

We did a 5pm early dinner, so it was a slow, Sunday holiday afternoon and a shame considering the amazing Father's Day menu.    As a Vegan its not my kind of food, but I found plenty to eat and they offer GF, V, VG.  But for my Dad it was perfect!  Crazy special menu for Dad's with to die for beer mustard!  I'm surprised I didn't find that advertised anywhere when searching for what to do in Phoenix for Father's day.  Shame!  We were served right away in the bar and got attentive service right to the dinner table.  Our dinner waiter Chris was excellent and talked us through the whole menu.  We didn't want for anything, he took us all the way to then end with a to die for dessert.  Environment, ambiance, layout, vibe & view... all excellent!  You can Valet park with hotel and they validate it down to $5 + tip.  Based on reviews the Tater Tots and cauliflower were excellent as reviewed!  The bacon is inside the tater tots not on side, but both are a must.  The grilled broccoli was good, but nothing special.  We shared all that and Summer Panzanella - with grilled fruit and cornbread and it was good but it wouldn't bring me back.  The waiter, cauliflower and dessert would!  But plenty more to try on menu.  Father's day menu was incredible and unique from Pate, beer mustard, pickled cauliflower, pork chops, onion gravy, 3 drinks ales to Scotch and literally a \"root beer\" float made with ice cream and ale beer!  Upon waitor's recommendation I ordered the upside down pineapple cake and it literally melts in your mouth... incredibly delicious!  All in all a very good experience prices from $5 - $50 on menu!  So works for everyone, great venue for business, nice occasional dinner, drinks, date, happy hour.  Definitely worth a visit!",

Our snacks were some deviled eggs that I'd read were delish & they were. So we're 3 for 3. Good staff, app & drink. We will be back for brunch. The pancakes sound amazing. I mentioned to the bartender that wanted to try the popcorn & asked him if he liked it himself. Like how spicey is it etc. He said it's a perfect mix you really should try it on your next visit. Then brought us a sample. He was right it was good. That's the kind of exemplary service all bartenders need to exude. It's all about the customer.",

    "text": "As with all our reviews, we rate Food, Atmosphere and Service.  Blue Hound nails it on all fronts.   The food is unique - I've never even seen most of these dishes on any other menu - and ranged from good to \"Oh My Gawd This Is Amazing!\" The bar is stocked with a terrific range of spirits with a particular emphasis on small batch American liquors.   The atmosphere is inviting with lots of comfortable seating and a good size bar to sit or stand around. The restaurant is located in the Palomar Hotel and - in keeping with the general vibe of an upscale/downtown hotel - has high ceilings, lots of wood and glass and a modern-but-not-too-trendy decor. It's a very nice place for a date or an evening with friends.   The service was terrific. We sat at the bar and our bartender Jesse, who was quite knowledgeable,  kept us hydrated without interjecting himself into our evening.   Cheyenne - who is, I believe, the Food & Beverage Manager - dropped by and talked with us, sharing her experience in the food industry in Phoenix. Cheyenne has been at Blue Hound since its opening and has a great sense of downtown Phoenix history of the hotel/restaurant industry. She's quite an asset to the Blue Hound.  We had the privilege of meeting Executive Chef Stephen Jones who personally delivered some of our menu items. This guy is good. He's created a menu that's a combo of southern-home cookin' \"Comfort food with a grown-up flavor palate\" and Asian fusion that doesn't exist anywhere else in the valley.  Chef Jones is a kind, generous and wonderful host who is quick with a smile and knows how to entice your adventurous side, delivering on all aspects of a dish. Food should taste as good as it looks and it does so here at Blue Hound.  Chef Jones does that and more; he's got a flair for the unexpected and a terrific flavor sense. Tater tots are not just simply Tater tots. Deviled Eggs are not simply eggs and Cheddar Biscuits are not just biscuits.    Downtown Phoenix needs more places like this to elevate the flavor palate environment in order to become a \"go to\" destination,  Blue Hound is doing it's part, others need to join.   The Food: if it seems like we ate a lot,  we did. We were treated to the very best Blue Hound has to offer, The food was exceptional.  We tried everything on the \"Snacks\" menu except the cheese plate and enjoyed it all. There's something here for every taste.  Shishito Peppers: This is a usually mild but sometimes hot small pepper, that's blistered and served in miso & sesame seeds and seasoned with sel gris. I abso-freaking-lutely loved these things. The texture and flavor are perfection in an appetizer. The Miso is exceptional and the sel gris (salt) is the finishing balanced touch done right.   Caramel Popcorn: This was actually pretty darned amazing. The menu says \"butterscotch with ancho chile\" which sounded a little iffy to me, but the execution was flawless. They call this endless which means if you are like me, you could eat about 8 pounds of this stuff. Very good.  Deviled Eggs: This one is surprising. It's \"just\" deviled eggs, but its garnished with brioche, smoked ham and dijon. The flavor is subtle and rich, and the eggs are so creamy it's criminal. This is another dish you could easily eat waaaaaay too much of.  Tater Tots: Chef Stephen nails it on this little dish. The texture of the tots is fabulous, and the upfront initial  flavor of potato and chive is oh so nice,  lets not forget bacon too.  These are tater tots for grown ups. You can use the dipping sauce that is served on the side but theses little babies don't need anything added. They are dangerous mouth popping snacks.   Potato Fries: French fries are one of those ubiquitous dishes that can be really boring. Not here. These are sliced in wedges, steak fry size, and perfectly fried and seasoned. The outside was crispy and the inside soft and creamy. Seasoned with aromatic rosemary and a very nice parmegiano-reggiano cheese, and served with a not-too-spicy aioli, its just another unique twist on what's normally an oh-so-common food.  Cheddar Scallion Biscuits: Oh My Gosh. Just try 'em. Trust me.  All we had on the \"Farm & Garden\" section of the menu was the Roasted Cauliflower, but in typical Chef Jones fashion, he puts a unique twist on it with pistachios, capers and currants. However, everything else on that section of the menu looks absolutely fabulous and we are eager to try it all.  The \"Sea & Ocean\" section of the menu looks very appetizing. We tried two dishes which pretty much blew our minds: First, the Bay Scallop Ceviche. Chef Jones said \"It's not what you think\" and he was 100% correct, it was uh-maz-ing! Second, the Jerk Cured Scottish Salmon: buttery and melt in your mouth. Both were utterly unique and ridiculously flavorful.  There's more on the menu, but there's just so much two people can eat in an evening.  We cannot wait to get back.",

The bartender was very knowledgeable about the plethora of liquors and drinks that they had on the menu and I was very impressed that he was shaking up drinks with one hand behind his back. The bourbon old fashioned that he made me was absolutely fantastic! Having recently returned from a trip to Japan, I was pleased to see the Japanese whiskys (yes, it's spelled with no e in Japan) that were on the menu. We got the short rib sliders and the blistered shishito peppers. The sliders were just ok, but I loved that they came on mini King's Hawaiian rolls. The peppers were spicy and delicious - it must have been the sriracha aioli. People around us seemed to be enjoying their food as well, so I would love to come back and try some other things on the menu.",

It's a great very open place; it's in the Paloma's, which caters to a seriously hip crowd. We both had a the Lawless bourbon cocktail flavored with tobacco smoke. It was excellent, but I guess I can't say I've never smoked anymore. We split the shishito peppers which were great. Ric had the roasted beet salad - amazing presentation and taste. I had the Kale salad which was great. I tried the shrimp and grits - my grandmother from Louisiana would have been pleased. Ric had a steak, which he thought was perfect.

I'm not sure if it was because it's down the street from the Phoenix Suns arena but, it was an amazing experience as we realized that they served upscale 'soul' food and it was actually one-of-a-kind. I would definitely recommend this spot especially if you are passing through.   One thing that really stood out to me was the bartender, or should I say mixologist!? We could really tell the difference and the drinks were amazing! Along with the delicious food, it definitely did not hurt that we got great seats and an ice skating rink was developed outside the restaurant that day!   We were really able to enjoy not only the food, drinks and ambience of the restaurant but also experience the vibe of the town and the local families. Definitely a treat!",

I returned the next night as it this were a toxic relationship and I was asking to get hurt. I spent the last 24 hours, writhing in pain from the food poisoning I received from my first visit. My friend was so poisoned from their food, she only wanted soup. I explained our predicament and pleaded our case. \"Just soup,\" I said, ending my plea. The bar tender could give a flying flip that we got poisoned by THEIR restaurant. We ended our trip with a small sprite that cost $3.50.

Fig spread. Good bread. Pungent chevre.   In essence, if you pray at the temple of the cocktail God, welcome to salvation.

This place has a nice warm, east coast big city type feel to it. Love. They also have a nice little patio that over looks Central and the west part of Cityscape.   Our bartender was very nice and patient w/ us while we decided what to order. I decided on the Floradora, a drink on their hangover menu (not because I was hungover, but because it sounded delicious). And it was, and was gone far too quickly for the price, about $9-$10 a piece. Price aside, their craft cocktail menu is vast and they also have a nice Bourbon, Gin, Tequila, and Scotch selection.  I would definitely recommend this place for happy hour drinks.",

We could still talk,but definitely not a quiet romantic place. The parking is $5 for the hotel valet with a stamp from the hostess stand or 2hrs complimentary in the city scape garage. We had the farmer's market greens and the heirloom tomato appetizers. We loved them both. For our second course we had the swordfish and the skirt steak. Our dessert was pineapple upside down cake and the chocolate brioche.(all of this was $33./person) There is a patio right outside the main restaurant area, but it was not being utilized the evening we dined. Hope to be back  soon and try the poolside bar (HH) and the restaurant with the regular menu.",

    "text": "Two stars.  Because, I really have had better.    A group of my foodie friends and I met up here in order to sort out the deets of our upcoming podcast.  The dude who made our reservation made it for four instead of five, so it took us a little while to get a table.  Not that big of a deal to me, especially since said dude bought a bottle of wine for the group to share.    At long last we were taken to our table.  Our group nestled in to our cozy booth and perused the menu.  I already knew there wasn't much for me to eat there, as I had checked their menu online.  My cohorts ordered some appetizers: tater tots and deviled eggs.  Both dishes looked good, and everyone seemed pleased.  The service began to get a little shotty at this point. It took a while to get waters to the table and there weren't any napkins or silverware at the table until we asked for some (after the appetizers were delivered).  Two of my friends ordered appetizer salads/soups which didn't come until the entrees came.  Salad friend ordered with no walnuts, he is allergic, but it came full o' nuts. Soup friend was presented soup and no spoon.  Soup friend also ordered several items and was told that they were out (which I can understand, given that there was a Suns game that night), when plates were dropped at the table servers were VERY quick to disappear, leaving us to literally have to yell after them for the missing stuff/refills.   As for my meal, I ordered the Citrus Marinated Olives and the Chicory Salad.  I let the server know of my vegan/gluten-freeness and he was helpful and accommodating.  The others seemed divided on their meals.  Lots of meat, that's all I can remember of what they had haha.  Eventually, the manager came to the table to apologize for all of the little mishaps and said a round of drinks was on the house. Fine by me, I thoroughly enjoyed my Tito's gimlet, thank you!  Then the executive Chef came out to apologize as well.  It was a nice touch.  All in all, I might give them a second try, but with all of the great places out there, Blue Hound might want to step up their game.",

We sat inside but the outdoor patio (which is on the top of the second floor of the Palomar hotel) looked more inviting, with those little string of lights hung across the patio and some plants out there too. I'll have to sit there next time we have dinner there. I had the homemade pasta which half of our table ordered. It was so flavorful and a great portion that no one had leftovers.  The hostess was super friendly, complimented me right away -which actually seemed genuine! Thumbs up! I noticed on the menu it said happy birthday on it. I'm not sure if it's because we were celebrating a bday or if it's on every menu. The bday celebrant didn't want any dessert unfortunately when they were offering, but the restaurant did all sign a bday card to give to him. Which blew our minds! What a caring staff.   We are definitely coming back for the next birthday dinner- and this time we will order dessert!",

I have finally found a spot (without having to drive to Scottsdale)  where I can get a truly wonderful Old Fashioned with a large block ice cube.  The decor is awesome, hip and elegant with beautiful lighting.  They have a very long wooden bar that I haven't been able to move past so I can't really comment on the dining room.   I am not sure why everyone keeps mentioning small portions... I have had several dishes and I didn't think they were small. Quite frankly I think Americans are overfed and used to large portions that could easily feed 3 people from one plate. Either way I ordered the ham steak and eggs and my friend got the KFC Sandwich and they were both HUMONGOUS!  In fact the ham steak  was the size of the entire plate! We both ended up taking half our meal home. I have also tried the flatbreads, the tots, the deviled eggs... All unique, distinct and palate pleasing.   They do a great happy hour and the bartenders are awesome. This is my new favorite spot in Cityscape.",

    "text": "So we turned up a little early for our 7:30 reservation on Saturday. Like a whole week early. Opps.. Unfortunately, we wouldn't be in Phoenix the following Saturday. And the place was packed, people waiting outside, not looking good.  Enter James the floor manager. He says \"let me see what we can do\" and goes off. Comes back a couple of times to confer with the hostess and finally comes back one last time with a thumbs up. \"Patio table OK\" he asks. Well, we just came to Phoenix from 10\" of snow and 10 degrees back in Colorado. 72 degrees outside sounds great. And it turns out, the patio is a lot quieter than inside. SCORE!  Next batter up, our server Christopher takes our drink order. Yup, they have Redbreast Irish whiskey. SCORE!  When Christopher returns we decide to try some shishito peppers, deviled eggs, brisket sliders and boudin balls for an app. All were excellent and gone in a hearbeat.  I was looking at the trout for my main but when my wife and sister both ordered it I decided on the pork shank. Not sorry that happened.  When the pork shank arrived, pulled the bones out cleanly and had the tenderest pork shank ever on top of the white beans.  I don't know about the trout, but my wife and sister looked like they were licking their plates when I finally looked up. SCORE!  Normally, I'm not one to overfill myself with dessert, but my wife had to have the chocolate cake something or other so I opted for the vanilla bean pudding with raspberries. Nice, light, tasty and not too filling. SCORE!  So much like the Cubs grand slam homer in their 9-3 victory over the Dodgers, we scored a grand slam thanks to James, Christopher and those guys, whoever they were, in the kitchen.  My advice, make sure you put this place on your list to visit. I know we will again... and maybe even on the right day!",

I got the pasta and it was okay, I don't love tomato but I think anyone else would enjoy it. Would've liked some bread for the table.",

    "text": "Lots of style, but very little substance.  Blue Hound is apparently one of the \"best new restaurants\" in Phoenix. Yikes - our experience here just didn't live up to the considerable hype this place has generated.  Menu: the menu is...interesting. It looks like they took every foodie buzzword they could think of, wrote them on slips of paper and pulled out three or four for each dish. \"Hmm...we've got short ribs, and blue cheese aaaannd grits - great!\" I mean, what is foie gras cornbread???  Atmosphere: super stylish and well executed. It fits right in with the Palomar - upscale without being overly trendy.  Drinks: BH has an ambitious cocktail list and a decent wine list. I appreciate the inclusion of a decent sparkler by the glass.   Presentation: just like the interior, the dishes here are beautiful. Everything that came out was perfectly plated and looked fresh and delicious.  Service: we had to wait almost 30 minutes past our reservation time, but BH comped us some drinks so that's cool. Our server did a fine job, considering they were very busy.  Food: here's where it falls apart. It doesn't matter if your joint is stylish, your servers are great and your dishes look like works of art unless it tastes good. And for the most part, our party of 6 said \"meh\". The sole exception was the giant short rib which fell off the bone and was truly exceptional. My flatbread was described as \" chorizo, fontina and arugala\". What I got was a giant cracker with a dusting of cheese, 3-4 tiny chorizo slices and about 5 arugala leaves. Two others ordered the cod and the reaction was \"well, that was...unusual\".   Prices: expect to pay a premium for small portions.  I think Blue Hound has tons of potential, but unfortunately our experience here was not up to snuff. I'd pass Blue Hound by for the time being.",

    "text": "This used to be my go to restaurant for dinner before an event downtown. I had a reservation last night before the concert and when we arrived the place was chaotic. We were told that the people who had the table in front of us were not leaving and it would be 15 minutes or more to sit down. We asked if we went in the bar would they come find us and we were told no, we'd  have to keep checking back with the hostess stand.   The manager ended up seating us in the bar and service was very disappointing. We wanted to have a glass of wine with dinner but it took so long that the wine arrived after we had finished eating. They said they were out of clean wine glasses. When they finally brought the wine, the  glasses were dripping wet all over - they hadn't bothered to dry them.   And one of the wines was wrong and had to be sent back.  I brought a friend who hadn't been to Blue Hound before and she said she would not go back.  I think I will look for other options in the future.  Pretty bummed about a disappointing start to a big night out.",

Not one bartender made eye contact, we stood there for 10 minutes and not one of the servers would even acknowledge us.  When she did she said no reservations, and the bar was full.  (Duh) we then watched servers take people to the \"reserved tables\" when asked how they were reserved, we they said no reservations again. We had looked online to find where the best bartenders were in Phoenix. This google placement had to have been paid for.  If you are going to charge 18 dollars for a Manhattan, then you should employ a staff who can at least say hello.  We left thirsty and in search of greatness.  Where we found in a dive bar of all places. The esthetics of the blue hound was super savvy. Think rich velvet chairs and many leather bound books. We loved the hipster uniforms, and butchers aprons on the bearded bartenders. Yet the lack of personality flushed it all down the toilet.    We both bartended for years, our standards are no different then how we would treat guests in our homes, you should share that feedback with your team.",

    "text": "Blue Hound has been on my list for a while now.  Finally got to get down here and have some food and drinks.    It's on the second level just above Squid Ink.  The place was 70% empty on a Friday night so it really wasn't the best sign.  We were seated by the windows in the back corner and had our own little private booth.  The decor and ambiance is very sleek.  Felt like a really cool place to hang out.    Our waitress was polite and took our drink and app order.  I got a whiskey sour with egg white.  My wife ordered a moscow mule.  We also ordered the corn grit fries and shishito peppers.  The corn grit fries were excellent.  They were really nothing like fries.  They were more like cheese tater tot sticks.  The bacon and cheese in them was very tasty.  The weird part was the sauce that came with them.  It was almost like a marinara sauce.  It really didn't go with the flavor of the cheesy tater tot sticks at all.  The shishito peppers were also excellent.  And the sauce with them was perfect.  I'd order these again in a heartbeat.  The drinks were good but awfully short and not worth 14 bucks a pop.  We split a kale salad as we were going to head to another spot nearby to have some food and drinks and didn't want to blow all our appetite here.  The kale salad was okay for me and my wife loved it.  Overall Blue Hound was good and in a great location with good service but I'm thinking this is more of a place to come during happy hour as it was a bit pricey for just our couple apps and drinks.",

I also really liked the chopped salad which was quite filling. The flatbread is good for sharing with friends. The cheese player could have been bigger, for the price I was a bit disappointed.   I had the French Quarter which uses Woodford Reserve, one of my favorites. The Old Fashioned here rivals The Gladly / Citizen Pubhouse, but is still not quite on part with The Hudson in Sedona in my opinion. My fiancee got La Belle Fleur which is perfect if you like sweet and pretty drinks.   I will definitely be back!",

From burning smoke into glasses to old school drinks using egg whites... Cocktails are absolutely first rate.  Interior is posh, cozy, cool. Very comfortable with restaurant, bar, lounge chair seating options. I started with the Hamachi Crudo ($15) which was ridiculous. I pondered ordering a second. Smoke infused caviar - oh my. Entree went with Short Rib and Scallop ($55). Delicious. Wine selections by the glass were somewhat limited (one Chardonnay for instance) but not enough to diminish the experience.  They had about five reds and five whites to choose.   Definitely worth the trip especially if you are downtown. Walking distance from many nearby hotels.",

Even the menu was cute and had whimsical categories like \"Just Like Mama Made\" and \"Light as a Feather.\" The Lost Melody was my favorite!  To start we had some amazing cocktails and had appetizers such as the corn grit fries, bacon deviled eggs, and short rib sliders. The corn grit fries were perfectly described as mozzarella sticks meet cornbread. The bacon deviled eggs were absolutely perfect, a different twist to a standard deviled egg. The short rib sliders were the star, tender meat with horseradish on a mini King Hawaiian roll. AMAZING!  Most of our table of 10 ordered the flat iron steak. Cooked perfectly, a little too rare for my medium rare taste, but really good. Fingerling potatoes and crispy frites were a perfect component to the dish. They also have yummy housemade pasta, friend really enjoyed her pappardelle.  The best touch was that with an opentable note saying it was our coworker's bday, they not only brought a great dessert but a card signed by all the staff including the chef! Who does that nowadays? So thoughtful!!! I didn't think I would like the chocolate pudding with marshmallow puff, but it was really good! I ordered the chocolate cake with peanut butter caramel with banana ice cream because it sounded so different and I like that combination, but would have to say the pudding was much tastier!  Overall, such a great dining experience from beginning to end! Will come back if I'm ever in the Phoenix area, as it was the best dining moment I had during my short stay here.",

We were seated right away by a very personable host & greeted by our server within 2 minutes of being sat.  He started us with some cocktails and appetizers while we perused the menu.   Some definite must try- Fried Green Tomato: sounds a bit strange right, but they were surprisingly good. Up for a new treat, these are for you! Deviled Eggs: bacon jam I don't need to say anything else  Shishito peppers: the furikaki and aioli ... Yum! Seared ahi salad: the bed of lettuce they used was fresh and a refreshing variety when added with a piece of the seared ahi  Cocktails- loved my dirty martini but was shocked when I tried the Lawless. The drink is made with bitters, wild turkey and this awesome smoke type concoction that adds flavor to the glass itself. Honestly, watching it be made was the fun part!   Parts of the restaurant over look a part of city scape which can be beautiful so if ever on a date night be sure to request a window table.",

The atmosphere and overall vibe suits my likings and the appetizers/ drinks come with a bit of flare that stand above your basics eats.  It's located in the Palomar Hotel off the upper deck level so people get a bit confused. If you don't come thru the hotel, escalators are on the side to take u up a level so look for the great big ol doors to the entrance  One particular appetizer is my ultimate favorite here and that's the BHKC deviled eggs... these jokers are so damn good i find myself getting 2 or 3 orders because I'm sharing my 1st order with friends and hogging the last one!!! After our group had the deviled eggs (and a few Moscow Mules in) I headed to the kitchen to inquire on the preparation and serving. The manager and kitchen crew were friendly and I let them know how much it was appreciated.   If your looking for a little low key spot for apps & conversation, head over to the BH   Haven't done dinner here yet so looking forward to trying in the future.",

    "text": "This was my first time back to Blue Hound in about two years. Everything about our visit (a business dinner with a job candidate) was terrific, particularly the service--flawless. I was a tad disappointed with a couple of dishes, though. First, I was really sad to see that the biscuits with bacon jam were not on the starters menu any more. *sob*  Second, we ordered the fried green tomatoes because our job candidate had never eaten them before. I was hesitant, if only because I grew up in the South and am pretty picky about that dish. These were just ok, and honestly, for $16, they were not up to snuff. The tomato slices were tiny--about the size of a silver dollar--and would have been pretty forgettable if not for the lump crab and remoulade accompanying them.  The shishito peppers, however, were outstanding and at $9, a fair price.  We also had the bone marrow starter (also $16), which is utterly delicious but not really the right size for three people to share.  Two people, sure, and I'll order them again.  For our mains, we had two orders of the trout and the flat-iron steak.  All were cooked perfectly and plated very nicely. My steak was medium-rare, as requested, and the cherries in the glaze accompanying it really made the dish (one of my dinner partners kept asking me for another)!  We finished by sharing a slice of the pineapple upside down cake. I loved it. Moist, not too sweet, light rather than dense. The sorbet served with it, however, really couldn't hold its own. Its flavor wasn't distinctive enough and something with a more significant mouth-feel would be a better foil for the cake.   The total for our dinner, not including alcohol or tip, was $145. That's steep for three people, but if you're looking for a place to go for a special occasion, Blue Hound Kitchen should be an option.",

Bottomless caramel popcorn?  This place is crazy.  The bar is small and a touch crowded.  There is seating in the lobby but it's a little hit and miss with a variety of chairs ranging from big leather to hard cube.  The dining area isn't very big but it has a cool view - if you are into urban views.    The food is nicely portioned.  The short ribs are some of the biggest I've seen.  The pineapple upside down cake is great with the salted caramel topping.",

Very swanky retro feel but cozy with plenty of wood details and great energy throughout the space. Awesome hip, urban eatery. More than you'd expect from a restaurant within a hotel in downtown Phoenix. I'd come back just for the restaurant even if I wasn't staying at the hotel.   Started off with the yellow corn cake app with onion jam and shaved squash=fantastic! We then shared the 'Big Ass Steak' with scallop potatoes. Equally fantastic. An enormous T-bone cooked just right:) at least 2\" thick!  Had two Mezcal cocktails with my dinner.  Good, strong drinks with old fashioned big ass ice cubes. Awesome looking and tasty drink if you like Mezcal.   Great joint. Wouldn't hesitate to come back.",

Rude, arrogant, snotty, obnoxious, loud, and annoying but my 3 star review was really based on the food. We ordered the fried green tomatoes. Now this is really not a hard dish to put together. They add their own flare to it with crab meat. The presentation was nice BUT, the tomatoes were hard and the crab meat was cold, which seemed odd. Too me, it seems undercooked and maybe the crab meat should have been warmed up. We also tried the boudin balls were just ok as well. They were just warm, not hot. The marina served with it was kinda bland. Just expected more flavor. I \"might\" try this place again but it's towards the bottom of the list.",

For my main dish I had the Pappardelle Schreiner's sausage ragu - rich and tasty but not too rich - perfect.  For desserts, I had the house made sorbets - all really tasty.  Good wine and cocktail selection too.  Nice decor - lots of wood, natural light and cozy feel for a large restaurant at night. Gets a little loud, but not unbearable. Service was good - not outstanding, but perfectly fine (think we may have had a relatively new waitress).  Would definitely consider going back if in Phoenix.",

My friend's margarita also came out sour.  We think they were training a new bartender.  The drinks were easily fixes with a splash of syrup.  Orders the sliders and wings ($6 HH).  The short rib sliders were fantastic!  I was not expecting such a huge portion of short rib (my favorite).  Seriously, add a few more sliders and some fries and you would have the perfect bar food happy hour meal!  I feel guilty not ordering some of fancy food for dinner, the shrimp and grits sounded divine, but I was craving a burger all week.  Their bar burger with pimento cheese, and bacon hit the spot in all the right ways :-) ($14) and the fries were topped with sea salt and cheese.  Blue Hound pays attention to detail.  Husband ordered the Manhattan ($6HH)...BOY WAS IT GOOD AND I DON'T USUALLY LIKE MANHATTANS!).  To top it off, I ordered the local AZ  Dos Cabezas Rose wine ( great recommendation from our waiter and a steal at $5 HH).  I recommend Blue Hound over its more uppity sister upstairs (Lustre) and will add it to our favorite cityscape places.",

As I'm writing this review, I went to re-check the menu to remember the specific name of the dish I got, and the whole menu has changed.  So take that in mind, maybe the food will be better if you go now, vs. the menu selection we had in September.   From what I remember, I was just generally unimpressed with what options we had to choose from and the food wasn't amazing.  That is why I decreased my rating.  The experience just made us cross this off the list of \"great places to eat\" in phx.  I don't think we'll be doing a whole trip down here for the food.

To which he replied \"That is a Brooklyn\" and walked away.  OK giving him the benefit of the doubt, our drinks came and my Manhattan was very nice (everyone else drank wine and beer, so you can't really screw that up).  We ordered round two and those arrived and then decided to order some food.  And it's as if our server vanished.  Only he didn't.  He just stopped coming to our table and waited only on those around us.  Finally I went to the bar to try and get help and a bartender found a server to come to our table...while his colleague continued to avoid our table.  The food was so so (macaroni and cheese, sliders and wings).  The young lady who took over service duty was great.  But the die was cast.  This was a bad experience and I will not be going back.",

My scallops were overcooked and tasted like they had been frozen, unfrozen and sitting in a bag of water all day. The pork belly was tough and grissley.

From the pork belly sliders, to the seafood chowder I ordered to go, and certainly not last the decedent pineapple upside down cake, I was in foodie heaven.   The sliders were topped with a crisp kimchi that paired marvelously with the tender pork belly. There were two somewhat smallish portions. I ate one and set the other aside to finish later that night. Because the principle reason I chose BH was the dessert, I asked for my second course to be boxed. I sampled the chowda at home later in the evening and it was wicked good: the ghost chile, which on the scoville scale it 10 degrees from being an A-bomb in your mouth (and, presumably, another fire a bit lower) brought an amazing heat balance with the subtle bacon and prominent mussels and clams. I'm not sure how this is served in the restaurant, but for the to-go you get a box of the clams and mussels. On to dessert. Simply wonderful! The salted caramel sauce is something I'd love to have a bottle of at home. It's decadent to the nth degree. It's the one sweet treat that I would give up sex for. It's *that* good.  At $40, this was an incredible value. Honestly, I think two people could easily share this meal and be pleasantly sated.  Who's my Daddy? You are, Blue Hound.",

    "text": "While in Phoenix for a conference in October, a group of us came here for dinner with reservations. We were accommodated with two rows of tables for about 20-30 people. The servers attended to us rather well. Great service so far.  When it came time to order, I asked for the Seafood Chowda. A few of my colleagues ordered the shortribs. When my food came, I was disappointed that the \"chowda\" barely had any broth in it. Probably two tablespoons worth. It had a good amount of mussels and a couple of clams. There were a few thin slices of tiny potatoes and that was it. Being a fan of hot and spicy foods I was expecting a little kick from the ghost chile. To my disappointment, all I tasted was salt. The food was very salty and not a trace of spice. I even asked the waiter when I ordered how spicy is it and was told that it had a good kick. I gave a mussel to someone to try and he agreed to the saltiness and no spice. When the server came around again, I asked if this is how it was supposed to be prepared and he said yes. I pointed out the lack of any broth, creamy or otherwise and he just shrugged his shoulders.   Other people in my party were disappointed as well. The short ribs did not even have a hint of blue cheese. And this was coming from a person who loves cheese and is also a chef.  Sadly, many of us walked out at the end of our dinner very disappointed. We found this place to be over-priced and over-hyped. We concluded that there was little effort to please us due to the large size of the group which guaranteed their gratuity.   It's sad that the only thing some of us enjoyed was the popcorn. My advice: review the menu carefully and ask a lot of questions. I most likely will not come back here the next time I'm in Phoenix.",

The atmosphere is trendy with large open windows and high ceilings. The caesar brussels sprout salad was really tasty and fresh as were the fish tacos which had mango and a good amount of spice.

    "text": "I came here with a friend last night because the reviews made it seem like the food was great and really friendly service. We were greeted by the hostess and taken to a table near the patio door, but behind some pillar. It was actually nice little seat, secluded from the other patrons with great window views. Unfortunately, when our server came over she neglected to tell us her name, offer any specials, and she barely made eye contact with either myself or my friend. We both ordered drinks (one house special and one whiskey and 7 with lime.) When the server returned with the beverages, she forgot my limes. It not being a big deal, I simply asked for them. She brought them over wadded up in a napkin and they were extremely dry, hardly any juice. Regardless, we ordered the sliders for an appetizer and they were delicious! Truly, some of the best we've ever had. The server came back to take our order, but neglected to offer an refills- of the drinks or the water. Our food came and we waived her down to get a refill of drinks, again no limes. This server *never* asked us how the food was or if she could get us anything else. One would think that charging $12 a drink the servers would be a little friendlier and quicker with service. After waiting nearly three minutes to even find our server, I simply flagged another server down (Simone) to ask for limes. This girl was amazing! Super friendly smile, was on it so quickly, speared the limes with a fancy pick, placed them in a bowl and delivered them to my table- and they were fresh! I wish she was our server, we probably would have had a much better experience. Sadly, at the end of the meal, I had to ask for the tab, because it wasn't offered, and inquired our servers name (Nicolette) simply so I could write this review. There was no charismatic charm, no attention to the guests, no inquiry on how things were going, no offering of specials - drinks or other wise, absurd wait time to receive drinks and garnishments, and absolutely zero interaction with her guests.   We MAY be back, but to go back for sliders and poor customer service is iffy. The pasta dishes we had were not out of this world, but decent. We would just prefer to go somewhere where the servers actually look like they enjoy their job and interact with patrons. If Simone was our server, we probably would have given her a 100% tip because of how fabulous she was, but Nicolette, it may be time for you to change jobs.",

    "text": "Happy Hour SCAM. The food is not why I am poorly rating blue hound. I came in Friday night prior to a concert. I and my friend sat at the bar and the place of course was packed. We specifically asked about happy hour and were handed the happy hour menu as was several other patrons. The happy hour menu simply had the hours (no day restrictions) and items with prices. We specifically ordered 2 glasses of wine, 2 beers and 2 apps all on the happy hour menu. We got the bill and was charged full price. When we asked about it, is when we got the shocking answers! We told the waitress and it was her that even gave us the menu and she said... Oh well that was given out wrong. We said well several other people have it and it's before 6 and there are no day requirements. Then a male bartender literally grabs the menu out of hands and says.... It's not today and walked away. We asked for a manager and were told they are so busy it could be awhile and they charged our receipt on tab and handed us a copy. I advised them it's against the law for them not to honor it and even if it were not, it's in poor ethical taste not to. She stared at me and walked away!!!!!   Well played Blue Hound. Even better staff :/",

The staff were friendly and polite and knew exactly when to approach the table to avoid interrupting conversations.  Food preparation time was reasonable and the dessert was amazing!  Would recommend to family and friends.  Blue Hound and Kitchen is also an ideal location in downtown phoenix if you are taking in any one of the live events that are all close by and in walking distance.",

    "text": "We were invited to an event here. It had a fix menu available. The food itself was ok. Our water was regularly filled up by the nice waiters. They took our order of the entree and desert. There were two long tables outside and when they started serving the salads, which did have enough dressing, they seemed to be too slow and I got my salad by the time my neighbor was already done with his. All entrees looked pretty good and also tasted good. I had the herb chicken, was a bit too dry, and my husband had the steak. I m glad it was all served outside since it appeared to be very noisy inside. Will I come back? Most likely not.",

    "text": "I had a morning meeting downtown and a colleague and I needed a place to strategize over breakfast.  He suggested this place.    After a quick look at the menu, I decided on a Buckwheat Belgian Waffle w/Vermont Maple Syrup, $12.  To wash it down, I ordered a Coffee and Water.  The server brought out a mini-pot of Coffee so that we could refill our cups at our leisure...bonus, I like when a restaurant offers that.  After a short wait our food was served.  I poured a little Syrup on my Waffle and took a bite....it was a little disappointing.  The texture was good and it was cooked just right...however, the flavor fell flat for me.  It tasted too \"grainy\"....not in the rough texture sense, but in the bitter, wild grains sense.  It wasn't what I expected....even the Syrup couldn't save it.  I only ate 1/2 of the Waffle.  Looking back on it, I'd like to try it with an IPA....it might go well with a bitter Beer like that and I love IPA's.  That would be weird though, ordering a Waffle at breakfast and a tall glass of IPA...ha!  Our server was great and the place is very well kept.  If I come back, I'll be sure to try something that I'm more familiar with.  Return Factor 50%",

    "text": "Blue Hound located in the Palomar hotel just below Lustre is a great place for a romantic evening. The location shares the second floor lobby of the hotel and has a unique ambiance that seamlessly blends semi casual and white table cloth.   This visit was a returning trip. I had written a comment on here and was contacted by the managing owner of the company. They had reached out to us with great customer service and invited us back. I asked them if they could offer us a romantic dinner for two on the house. The owner happily responded well provide the dinner but you have to bring the romance!   They treated us to a great meal. Me and my partner had the chance to try out a wide selection of the menu and it was an overall fun and enjoyable experience. I would happily come back here.   This location does have free wifi, so its not only great for dates but great for casual after work drinks or even just lounging around.",

    "text": "Took my boyfriend here for a going away dinner as he was leaving for vacation the same weekend, and I wanted to wow his pants off with somewhere we have not tried yet that would have different and fun ingredients. Parking was a bit of a hassle, but we ended up parking in the same garage as the restaurant so it worked out to our advantage that the other lot was full.  Service was great, waiter was very polite, prompt and gave great suggestions.  The food was amazing! We had the Deviled Eggs, Tater Tots, and Risotto balls for apps. The smaller portion was perfect to taste, and not leave us too full. I ordered the scallops and he ordered the rib-eye. The rub on the rib-eye was amazing, and the scallops melted in your mouth.   I will defiantly be back here with him to try other menu items! I made reservations at 9 on a Saturday, and there was barely anyone in the dining area so I don't feel the need to do that again.",

The salad with the champaign vinaigrette was very nice, too.The fries that go with the burger were made from a whole potato and were tasty. We also had, as gratis for coming down after seeing the Blue Hound on \"Check Please\" , the corn grit fries weren't to my liking even though they came with a dipping tomato sauce.
