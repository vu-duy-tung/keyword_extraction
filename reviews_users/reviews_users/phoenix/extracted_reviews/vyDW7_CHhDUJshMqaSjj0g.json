Didn't like that they allow smoking on the pation (\"only in the corners\", but the smoke smell prevailed over the entire patio).  Good friendly service.  The ostrich burger was interesting.  I had it done MR (chef's rec), and it seemed a little pink but moist.   My guests also had the ostrich burger (but overdone) and a regular burger (which looked scrumptious).",

    "text": "I went here twice over a few days while I was staying at the Hyatt next door. The first night had slow service but the burgers were good. So were the margaritas. A few nights later, the service was appalling. And I mean as bad as I have ever seen anywhere. We got seated right away but waited for 10 minutes before getting our drink order in. Then it was another 15 minutes for our thrown together margaritas with no salt or lime to arrive. And another half hour for two burgers to arrive. There were people walking up on the street waiting to get seated but after 10 minutes of nobody greeting them, they eventually walked away. Others got seated, waited and waited while nobody came to greet them and walked out without any wait staff knowing they were there. Others could not wait any longer to get seated so just walked in, found a table, sat down and were ignored. No idea where the manager was. I was in no rush and watching the horrific service play out in front of me was entertaining enough to stay. Right after our food arrived I ordered another drink which by the time we finished eating and it had not arrived yet, I told the kid waiting on us to forget it. No margarita is worth another 20 minutes of waiting. He looked surprised I was upset. He may have looked more surprised at the comical tip I left him. No excuse for such terrible service at such a premium location right downtown. No idea how this place stays open if this is normal for them. I can't say service is like this all the time but be warned if you go here. Give yourself plenty of time and prepare to be patient.",

This place is good if you are at the hotel and need a quick meal, but don't make plans to go here for a sit down dinner, you're better off going somewhere else. It is better than the place next door, called Matador. We had breakfast here twice and lunch once, out of convenience because of our conference at the convention center.",

We waited a few minutes for a spot to open and we sat around and waited for the bartender to come to us. She never did and when she did I asked her for a beer and she did not even look up at me, she went and did her business and attended everyone else but me, so I just left I thought it was BS. I decided to give this place a second chance so I went there at around 11pm and this time we sat at one of the tables, we waited 15 minutes for someone to come help us and when we did we ordered two drinks, they took a long time with those drinks and the place was not even busy. After that they completely forgot about us, we were contemplating walking out on the check but instead we waved the server down for our check. I will never go back to this place again.",

We were essentially ignored the entire night as she  never checked up on us, or refilled our drinks and the restaurant was not busy so there was no excuse for her lousy service. We had to flag her down again just to get our bill. The restaurant wasn't busy which was strange because this was right before an event. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good. It had no flavor. If you are seeking simple bar food, I would recommend Jacksons on Third and Cooperstown over this place. I would even recommend the Matador restaurant next door. We won't be coming back and I don't recommend this place",

We decided to have dinner there...and I am so glad we did!  The food was fabulous and presented as if it were on the verge of being gourmet type food.  Totally unexpected and delicious!  And the bonus was that our meals each only cost $8.95, which was the special menu of that time period, I guess.  While we were enjoying our meals, a musician set up on the sidewalk in front of where we were sitting and began playing some mellow, folksie type music, which was perfect.  Our waiter was a bit quirky and disheveled looking, but friendly enough and more than willing to do whatever it took to please us.   We are not hard to please, though, as long at the service and food is worthwhile...which it was.  We will definitely go back to Steve's whenever the opportunity presents itself.  :)",

My husband had the chicken BLT and the chicken was dry and small and the flavor was bland. The service was friendly but a little harried.

Than as me and friends are finishing up dinner a waiter accidentally dropped glasses of water on my back. He apologized which I understand accidents happen. But what shocked me was 1) the manager didn't even bother to come out to apologize and if manager wasn't there than the next person in charge should have also come out to apologize. But to my surprise he/she didn't. What a coward. 2) not even some type of discount was given.  Not that I needed it but being offered what would have been a nice gesture after they gave me a shower.

We stood at the hostess stand for 5+ minutes, before finally grabbing one of the very busy waitresses who ended up seating us. She was very nice, but you could tell she was in over her head and they were under staffed. She did the best she could, but it shouldn't take over 30 minutes for your food to arrive, especially during lunch. The food was mediocre, nothing to write home about.   With all of the conventions and nearby hotels, they have the potential to do great things, but from my experience, I don't know that I would ever return.",

The caesar salad was huge and good value, had lots of cheese, fresh lettuce, with wonton strips on top instead of croutons, which were very good.   The kids had quesadillas, which were average and yummy shoestring fries. My wiofe had grilled vegetable bruschetta, which was just sauteed veggies in a bowl, with garlic bread on the side. While tasty, not your Postino bruschetta, needed more pesto on the veggies.  Overall, good place to go before a game, or lunch during the week.",

Great Margaritas (try the Coyote & the Pomegranate) The shakes & floats are pretty yummy as well.  One of the main reasons I like come is *because* of the staff... They've always been friendly & funny & quite entertaining. I'm a patron that likes to interact w/ who-ever is serving me.   Seating is plentiful inside & out. The bar seating itself is a little small-ish. Friendly diner-feel inside.   Steve's comes highly recommended from me ;)",

The food is good, and the prices aren't that bad.  The thing I want to point out is the drinks; they're fantastic! I'm the guy who doesn't care much for beer and goes for the mixed drinks (go ahead, laugh). Steves has some of the biggest margaritas I've seen. The price isn't too bad and when waiting for your food, it's nice to have that giant drink and enjoy downtown Phoenix with some friends.  The outdoor seating is nice and sheltered by the buildings, so the sun doesn't cook you while your food is being cooked inside. Honestly, I've never sat inside, I love the outdoor seating so much! Bring on the 110 degree heat!",

The BLT my girlfriend had was again, average, nothing spectacular. The fried ice cream for dessert was nearly impossible to eat because of how hard it was.   However what really tipped the scale on poor ratings was the HORRIBLE service. The server knew nothing about the drinks, was unresponsive or un-knowledgeable on any of the questions and was EXTREMELY rude, short and snappy. The server was also VERY slow - slow on refills, slow to bring the check, everything! (I ended up leaving cash when I wanted to pay with card because I was sick of waiting!!)   I am a VERY good tipper, and was extremely upset I had to pay the 18% gratuity; if that were not included she would of gotten no more than 10% for her horrible service!  BAD BAD BAD SERVICE!!

Us sitting and constantly flagging the server down for things we needed cause he never stop by on his own.  2nd visit was more of the same...had to ask multiple times for anything we wanted.  Had to flag server down cause he never stop by our table.  My cousin had time to walk to CVS and back before the server came to our table and take our order.  I don't think I will go back.

We were only there for about 30 minutes, but in that time, I was pleased with the level of service we received, and with the chips and salsa.  The chips are kinda different, almost like fried wontons in their texture. They were delicious. And the salsa had a nice flavor, and decent heat.  I was hoping to have breakfast after the crawl, but I was too exhausted (old) and had to head home long before that happened.  I will definitely go back to Steve's, and especially to try their breakfast menu.  (only 3 stars because I didn't get enough time or food experience yet)",

I ordered their signature Green House Pasta, which was one of the blandest things I'd ever eaten. Our server was so scatterebrained and running all over the restaurant that he forgot part of my order and I still can't figure out why. He didn't appear to have any other tables.....???? He kept saying \"be right with you guys\" every time he left. Uhm, are you trying to tell us that You'll be back? or that you'll see us when you see us? I'm so confused... did you forget that you already helped us?  This restaurant solely survives on business from Hyatt and Wyndham guests that stumble outside and see the first place they can eat. I told our server that I thought my food was awful, and I ate it anyway because I didn't have time to wait for another item nor did I want to risk my food.   One thing I noticed is the menu says \"we use fresh fish as often as possible.\" What the fuck? So what if you can't get fresh fish? you're going to serve me something less than that? How about \"we only use the freshest fish.\" Or truly, do you sometimes serve unfresh fish?",

I asked the bartender to trade the yellow JellO shot for a red one and bartender said no. Like a quick NO. I was in shock. Like why!?  Ok there you go. Short, older woman bartender is rude and SHE is the reason you deserve 1 star!",

Five different people came to our table and we were iust there for breakfast. This was immediately after we heard that we would have to wait 15 minutes for a server.  The place was slow by the way. Then, delicious food arrived, but no one checked in at all with us. Coffee cup was empty and toast that came with meal never showed up. We actually got the bill and then the toast showed up afterwards.   The thing is, I really want this place to succeed. The food is good and the location is great.  Management...wake up!!!",

I would give negative stars if i could. It wasn't busy at all. I guess they don't like making money or serving food. Which is an odd policy for a restaurant.",

We walked up to the door and saw the hours posted on the door saying they close at 11, so we turned around and started walking away when a waiter opens the door and tells us \"We're open!\" so we go inside.  I believe they're open until 2am on Saturday night.  We are vegan and this restaurant is not geared towards the vegan crowd; however, they do have a garden burger on their menu.  They were so kind to make vegetable fajitas for my husband.  There drinks were superb with the Cadillac margarita being one of the best my husband has had!  Tony was our server and he was amazing! We sure enjoyed talking with him.  He loves working there and was so enthusiastic about his job (his 2nd job for many years) and his family.   The atmosphere here is 2 stars but you need to overlook that.  The patio is way nicer than the inside.   Give this place a try and support a locally owned business in downtown Phoenix!",

Saw one of the waiters give the bartender the middle finger after the bartender convinced a few college girls to sit at the bar instead of being seated at a table - very classy.  Also, had the pleasure of sitting next to an individual who was in need of a bath.  After trying to be nice to this individual since he was starring at us for a few minutes, we said, \"hello\" and we were met with a \"grrrrr\" for a response.  I think the restaurant should have questioned if that was the type of client they are in search for.      Again, decent food, good prices on beers but management needs to question their decisions",

I love living in a city and the patio has that awesome downtown, surrounded by big buildings, busy feel. They had televisions so we could watch the basketball game, and misters so we could stay cool. (Great misting system by the way, not the annoying kind that just soaks everything.)   I made sure to check up on Yelp to see how my fellow Yelpers felt about this place before stopping by. They only gave the place 3 stars, but all the reviews were pretty positive, so we gave it a whirle.   Three stars is very accurate. Why?.... the good.... -cute fun ambiance -nice big menu that can satisfy anyone -very nice friendly staff -great looking happy hour -and there is a Groupon Now for more than 50% off - winning! the bad.... -lousy service, not horrid, but slow and waitress couldn't be found sometimes -a tinny bit on the expensive side - happy hour is the time to go! -food was good, not great but good (specifically, cottage cheese was watered down and the mac'n'cheese had way too much chipotle spice in it)  Over all we had a good time, the people watching is great! There was a convention about to start for some wacko hippy spiritual liberal boarder hopping group. Ha-Lare-E-Os!   I def recommend them, but try to get the Groupon or check out happy hour, and don't be in a hurry.",

I had the strawberry lemonade which was phenomenal!  I had the tuna melt, my friend had the California burger, and my another friend had the chicken and chips. The food was delicious amongst all of us. I also used a Groupon and had absolutely no issues with it. The food the service and everything was excellent. We will definitely be back again to try the specials.",

Chicken sandwich dry, no flavor.We noticed they had some specials that night so we came back. We had bartender helping us. He was great. 50 wings! Fantastic..the honey hot are the best wings ever, tarot tots...yum! And the watermelon margaritas and the long island iced tea are the best ive had. This place is definitely the BEST choice around the convention center. A little rough around the edges but for some reason we kept going back and I'd continue to do so during my next convention.",

    "text": "Seeing that they only have 2.5 stars does NOT surprise me! My friend and I decided to try this grill since it was across the street from the Hyatt. There was no wait to be seated, and when we got there, there were a few people at the bar, and a table of around 8 seated.  The place was otherwise empty.  We got there at about 4:25 and were seated by an older woman (fake blonde hair, around her 60's from the look at it)  that was our server said was the hostess.  About 15 min later, my friend inquired (at the bar) if we were supposed to order at the bar, at which she was told no, we should have a server.  Another 10 min went by at which time I approached the older lady and asked her \"do we need to find somewhere else to eat or will someone be serving us within the next couple min?\"  She got snappy and said that she would have someone right with us.  Raquel--the server--came by momentarily and took our order.  A couple min later, the older lady came by and asked with an attitude, \"Did your server come over?\" which we replied yes to....as she walked away--with a VERY rude tone, \"then there is no problem!\"  The server came by with our drinks and we asked what the older's lady name and if she was the manager.  She informed us that her name was Linda and that she is not the manager but a hostess.  We asked for a manager.  Linda came over in just a few moments and said, \"you asked for a manager?\" When we responded yes, she said she was the manager.  I asked her for a different manager and she said she's the only one on duty.  I told her, \"ok, thank you.  I'll call on Monday and speak to a different manager.\" at which point her response was \"If there's a problem, we can ask you to leave now.\"  I told her that her attitude was the problem and I will take it up with someone else at another time.  Her next statement was, \"Do you want to eat or not?!\"  I advised her we already placed our order.  As she walked away she made another comment, at which point I said \"There's that attitude again!\"  The food looked good but had no flavor.  Raquel was wonderful and was on top of it.  We left her a good cash tip since her service was good....it's just too bad she has to work with people like that!",

It was a sunny day so my group chose to sit in the patio. The patio was a popular choice and it quickly filled up during peak lunch hour.   I ordered the grilled salmon sandwich with fruit. (Alternatively, sandwiches and burgers came with choice of tater tots, fries, house potatoes, cottage cheese or cole slaw.) The salmon was cooked just right, although tasted very plain. Good thing the sandwich came with a side of chipotle remoulade for dipping. The sauce spiced up my sandwich. It was a satisfying meal overall and the portion size was perfect for me.  As for service, I thought the hostess who seated my group was trying to force us to sit inside. (No one was sitting inside the restaurant at the time.) She didn't even ask if we wanted to sit in the patio and I insisted that we did, had even pointed out an open table initially, but she had walked away so fast with the menus that she missed our motion. However, our actual waitress was very pleasant and welcoming. We enjoyed her bright and cheery personality.  Price: $10.",

I was completely appalled by what took place in this establishment today.  My co-worker and I had placed a pick up order and while we waited to be served we watched the staff and manager treat these customers horribly!  A silent spoken man walked up to the bar area to \"Kathy\" asking if she could get his server so they could check out.  She (Kathy) snapped and yelled at the gentleman saying \"I am not your server... There are four other people ahead of you... \"Can't you see I'm busy\".  My co-worker and I were blown away.  The man and his female companion (friend, girlfriend, wife...whatever) then asked for the manager or owner.  Another short hairs blond woman appeared and states she was the manager.  This lady, the so called manager then started to yell at this couple.  I was blown away.  There are so many choices for eateries in the downtown area to choose from that one would think you'd try to keep your customers.   I will say the food was good, but the service from the bartender \"Kathy\" and this \"manager\" was unbelievable.  A BIG SMH!!!",

If you're just coming here for drinks you'll be happy assuming you ever get them. We've been here twice now while Phoenix Comicon was going on. It's crowded and noisy but you have to expect that. It's also a little expensive but everything is in downtown Phoenix. It also can take a while to get service and your food. Again, I'd be okay with that if the food seemed like it was not just slapped on a plate in the most haphazard way possible. I ordered a chicken taco salad last night. When I eventually got it, it tasted good but it did not contain a single piece of chicken! I didn't bother to tell the waiter because even though I'm on vacation I don't feel like waiting an hour. The previous time I got the drunken chicken sandwich which looked like it was assembled by an actual drunk.  I mean, fine, if you're going to serve mediocre food that's one thing but don't charge as much as everyone else in the area. I wouldn't recommend getting anything more than an appetizer here, but next time I'm in Phoenix and it's over 100 degrees I'd still probably go in for the Blue Moon.",

I started with a nice, not great, brew - Devil's ale or something - at the rec of my waiter. I then ordered Chico's meatloaf, the chef 'signature' dish. It is tasteless meat lying on a bed of tasteless soggy fried potatoes & covered with nice but nothing special marinara sauce. It came with two spiceless spicy cajun onion rings and 'eh' enchilada soup of the day. Service was good & the price was right $20.00 with tip but the food & ambiance was lacking. So if you want an OK nothing special inexpensive meal then it will fill the bill. Otherwise as noted in my tip: Don't go there.",

    "text": "I realize this restaurant was busy during mid-SB week, as I'm a very patient person.  Compounding things is I became very ill on my vacation and needed a comforting meal.  What followed was the most bizarre dining experience that I've had in many years.  First I was ignored for a good 20 minutes after being seated. A manager saw me being kinda ignored and got the drink.  Later had to specially ask for water (I had requested it but it was forgotten).  Then to the entree.  I needed fairly healthy and plain (not fried).  So even though I'm a burgers and wings kinda guy, I opted for the grilled tilapia entree with red potato.  My server talked me out of the potato and said that the sliced version was tasty but not greasy.  She insisted I wasn't entitled to a dinner roll or a choice of soup or side salad as the menu stated.  A tilapia sandwich arrived, clearly with the plain fish and fixins on an open bun. The sliced potatoes were fried like french fries, draped in grease. I questioned this to my server and she insisted that this was indeed the entree.  When the manager was roving around, she asked me if there was an issue and I explained.  She shook her head, apologized (server is newer) and offered to get me the entree with salad.  Super nice lady, I can tell she was juggling lots.  Then the server came over (while redo was in the works) and said she was sorry and how come I didn't let her know there was an issue.  Yes, I did, at ordering the entree (wasn't this to include soup or salad etc) and upon arrival (hey this looks like a sandwich, not an entree). Incredible.  So the meal arrives and the fish, instead of tender and soft like the sandwich version, is close to a chew toy in terms of being overcooked.  I mean, really.  The final perplexing aspect is when I ordered a turkey wrap to go.  I specifically asked that the wrap not be heavy in dressing. The server told me that dressing came on the side; I reiterated how I was ill and needed no/little oil in the wrap. Of course, the wrap I received was lathered on dressing.  Lathered, saturated.  To recap, slow indifferent service unless a manager notices.  Servers who don't know their own menu and take no initiative to verify what the customer will receive. And oh by the way, when I returned to my hotel afterwards, I lost my lunch in its entirety.  Maybe this place would be great if just ordering burgers and fries during a non-busy time of year and from a knowledgeable server.  But this was my experience.",

My wife's poached eggs were done perfectly and our fruit was freshly cut. The toast options were minimal, but that seems to be the standard the further south you get. Unless you want a biscuit. But we didn't.   My Greek omelet was slightly smaller than I had hoped, and it tasted like it might have been made with liquid egg, but it was really good. The cheese was fresh and it wasn't greasy. My English muffin was toasted well done just like I like it.",

They handle us the menus and they were dusty and dirty.  The cups (drinks) were also dirty. I told them about my son's allergies (nuts) and the server went to talk to the chef and came back super fast to let us know that we was too busy and could not accommodate our request. Now, this is 10 am and the place is empty except for a large party on one side of the restaurant and one other table outside.  The waitress even agreed with us but she told us that the owner was not in the restaurant at the moment otherwise she would of done something. The person that refused our service was Elmer the cooks manager.",

In some situations if the food is exceptional then poor service really shouldn't be but is some what more tolerable.However in this case NOT... So, just a word to the WISE ... if you are hungover and need something to eat and everything else in the downtown Phoenix area is closed, before you stop by this place, I recommend you seek other alternative or  Go home and cook.",

First the waitress didn't know what beer was on tap when my husband asked her and she didn't know if they had buffalo burgers which was on the menu, so I thought maybe she was new, we later found out she wasn't.  Well, we ordered the buffalo burger medium once she found out they had it and wings well done.  When burger came out it looked like a McDonalds cheese burger and when I bit into it I saw that the meat was rare and not medium and the wings were far from being well done.   We tired to get the attention of the waitress but couldn't there was only 2 other tables she was attending to, so the hosted came to me and ask if she could help, I asked for a manager, she told me she would once she sat the new guest and then never called the manager.  Waitress finally came to the table and asked if she could get the check, I told her what was wrong with the food and she said she would get the manager, 10 mins later no manager or waitress. Hosted asked if I got check and I said no! I asked for manager! She came back with check.  I paid and left.  Worst experience ever!!!  Shitty food and bad service!!!",

Then our ding dong waitress says I'll start you off with water w/lemon & the gal who seated us brings water w/out lemon!  Now mind you, I know they were super busy, it was 5 in the afternoon before a concert on a Friday but they seemed understaffed and the wait staff, the entire staff, seemed way too young and inexperienced and under-trained! Our waitress knew nothing about the menu, nothing about how things were cooked, nothing! She didn't even have a freakin' pen! She was a ding dog! I wanted to leave $0 tip but my friend felt bad & left $3 on her $8 tab because the waitress didn't even know how to split the tab and half which is what we'd requested! It was that bad! And to top that off, my salmon was so dry, it was crunchy! AWFUL! Wherever \"Steve\" was, he wasn't in the house! I think the only reason why that place stays alive is because it's in the heart of downtown, otherwise, i do not recommend it!",

Each day of the week has a different special so keep your eyes open if your nearby. The staff was fun and charismatic. They also offer a great home cooked breakfast starting at 6:30AM that doesnt break the bank. I couldn't of wished for a better place to set up camp while I was in town.",

    "text": "I have really mixed reviews with this bar / restaurant. It's very casual and has a great outdoor patio in the front facing the semi-private street. I liked the atmosphere a lot. It's more sports related. There's multiple seating on the large patio as well as inside the bar. The bottled beer specials are unbeatable for a downtown bar. Beer, wine, and mixed drinks are 1/2 off. The bottles averaged $2 on happy hour while other bars average $4-$5 for bottles.. Happy hour outside on the patio is 3-6. It's continued to 7pm if you go inside the restaurant. Pricing on bottles is definitely, A+. They have a happy hour food menu with $4 and $5 pricing and a nice selection. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. My experience was completely soured when I ordered the Mexican pizza on the happy hour menu. Mexican pizzas are supposed to be pizzas hence the name pizza. This was a very cheap, flat cheese crisp with limited cheese and jalapenos.It was a cheese crisp at best. It was by far the worse aka Mexican pizza I've ever seen. I immediately complained to the server. I actually told her it was horrific, not a pizza, and the worse example of a Mexican pizza I've ever seen. I told her I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs. She completely agreed!!! She also said it looked horrible and wasn't worth eating!!! YET, there was no offer to comp it off my bill or bring the manager over. I told her to tell the cook it was awful. She just kept agreeing. I didn't get compensated for it, no apology, just nothing. I left the entire thing sitting on the table. If you're looking for cheap bottled beer, a pretty cool atmosphere, and easy parking, this is your place. I couldn't rate it a 1 star because of the other perks. Not comping me and agreeing how horrible the food was is unacceptable.",

After giving up on it was finally able to talk to a manager. He told me that they hand cut all of their meat and many customers prefer the gristle. I said I understand that some would like marbled or fatty but gristle in fajitas? Maybe it is me but I have never heard of that. Offered me a 15% discount on a meal I didn't eat. He seemed earnest in his belief in the popularity of gristle. Rest of the meal was ok for bar food.",

The servers were very odd, loud and kind of annoying. I'm not sure why but this place just didn't speak to me...   They do have $1.75 Miller Lights on draft for happy hour.",

    "text": "Go for the food, not the service. My friend and I were looking for a pretty cheap place to eat downtown in between some meetings. We had a few hours to kill and didn't want to grab anything quick (like jimmy johns or chick fil e) just something affordable. We found this spot and decided to check it out.  When we first got there the hostess asked if we wanted to sit in or outside. Not really sure ourselves we talked for maybe just ten seconds and then she made the decision for us. No one else was waiting in line ..   Luckily it turned out ok to sit outside, but I was not a fan of her abruptness.   From there it took about 15 minutes for our server to get to us. Luckily another one who was working outside and grabbed us some drinks. I was surprised that we got our food in a timely fashion and that it was still hot.  I ordered a turkey burger and my friend had a regular burger. I fell in love with the food. It was just the kind of bar food I was expecting too. Big and greasy. So my cravings where definitely satisfied as where my friend's.  The disappointment with service continued though. Our server offered us condiments to dress our burgers when she dropped them off, but we never saw her until we were basically done our meal. So of course we grabbed some ketchup from an abandoned table. She first took my plate since my friend was still working but then didn't show up again until 12 minutes later with the check. Never asking us if we wanted drink refills or anything else to eat. Then another 8 minutes to grab the bill and another 6 to check us out.   Mind you it was well staffed and not very busy, yet we were there for 1.5 hours instead of a comfortable 40 minute meal.",

My friends are in music, so after Symphony performances,  we had a couple times stopped at this place for the patio seating and some tasty burgers or grill fare. Last visit was our LAST. The waiter was slow, ungracious ( no please or thank you even), incompetent ( waited for food to chill before bringing out flatware), and when asked about an error on the check, downright rude. Waiter is evidently part of the \"family business\" judging by the resemblance to the even ruder guy in charge, who came out to verify the error. ((He had a special posted on the promo chalkboard he was refusing to recognize.) He acted as if we had insulted them by asking for a corrected bill...and after a few words to point out the mistake, to emphasize how little our money meant to him, instead of re-ringing us, he took a big, grubby roll of small bills out of his pocket and counted out the credit onto a nearby table, right down to the dime. His rudeness and hostility was incredible! He made sure we knew how inconsequential our small party was to him. NEVER GOING BACK. The food was ok...like a hundred other places. We use Switch or a nearby grill for after-music dinners now!",

Apparently, that even means when the place is not busy.  Asked for a beer list and the server told us local brews.  We asked \"what local brews\", she says \"I don't know\".  We then asked if she had a list.  She says \"I don't know, lemme check.\"  10 minutes later, we get a list.  My better half got a margarita which she said was undrinkable.  I took it down mainly so that we could leave.  My group also got an order of potato skins which were edible.  Can't say that I'll be back.",

We ate here last year and were unimpressed but figured we would give them the benefit of the doubt and another try...big mistake!!! We stood outside waiting to be seated for forever and  were finally greeted ( and I used the term lightly)by some sour faced hostess that seemed to hate her job... maybe even her life.  Another long wait and our server showed up... the food did come out quickly... but how long does soup and salad take.  But after that he pretty much disappeared.... We sat there for the better part of 30 minutes ...totally finished eating, just hanging out for our check. We were seated outside and saw several groups of people just walk away because they were tired of standing there waiting to be seated. I would understand if the place was busy but it is far from it...its too bad because we do a lot of work at symphony hall and would frequent this place because its convenient...but I think I've had my final bad experience",

    "text": "went here tonight for happy hour before the DBacks game.  Took about 10 minutes for the waitress to visit us.  i should mention the place was nearly empty.  Waters took another 10 minutes.  when we ordered, the waitress asked us if we were here for happy hour and we said yes; my friend ordered wings and i ordered a salad, both from the HH menu.  Food came about 20 minutes later and was very good.  waitress checked in on us once then we had to flag her down to get our check quite a while later.  we asked her to split my beer and salad & friend's beer and wings on our cards.  although the wings are listed on the HH menu, and waitress knew we were there ordering for HH, wings were billed at full price.  Flagged down to ask about this and she said \"the wings are not on happy hour.\"  ????  um, yes they are, and again she repeats that they are not, regardless that it's written in black & white on the menu.  she gives us no explanation, just that they're not on happy hour.  then she got irritated we didn't understand this.  she said she meant to tell us this but kept forgetting.  apparently the wings, although again, on the HH menu, are NOT on HH on game nights.  this is mentioned no where, written no where, and was not told to us when we ordered.  fail fail fail.  the waitress was unapologetic, abrupt with us, unwaivering, and didn't give a crap that this was on her to mention from the get-go, not once we get the bill and have to ask about it.  between her shitty attitude, crappy customer service, and the 'customer should know what's on the HH menu and what's not, regardless of what's actually written on the HH menu' policy, there is no need for me to patronize this place again.   too bad, because the guitarest was awesome. i know it's not a huge deal, but the waitress handled this completely wrong, knew it, and did nothing to remedy and learn from it.  i was a waitress for a long time; takes A LOT for me to leave a crappy tip.  this gal got a $2 tip for her efforts.  maybe that'll get her attention.",

It's partially our fault, as we were in \"we're on vacation and we can eat whatever we want mode\" and ordered fried calamari, fried cheese sticks, and fried chicken fingers.  No, the menu doesn't state fried so redundantly.  Taking the blame for our unhealthy choices, I still have to say this is the worst food I've ever had in the Phoenix area. We were raking our brains trying to come up with any other place that was even close to this bad, and couldn't come up with anything to compare it to.  My boyfriend's comment, \"how can you screw up fries?\"  The only plus was that our waitress was quick, and nice.  She offered to replace my beer (ordered the special, terrible!) with something I would like, and was very pleasant.",

So we ordered a few things off the normal breakfast menu. My wife ordered some cheesy, bacon omelet which came with a side of potatoes and 2 pieces of toast. I ordered the french toast with 2 eggs on the side. Everything was very good. Service was fine as well. Prices are pretty good- though $2.75 for coffee seemed a bit much.

I am not typically one to complain, but when the waiter takes the order and writes it down, then I would think the cook would get it right, right?  Anyway, the place was average.  I had a root-beer float and it was actually better than the food.  If, I would have known, I would have just had the float. The waiter was trying too hard to be funny and play off the mistake, but didn't work.  I left dissatisfied. I think this place stays in business just because it is close to the convention center and in the district with a lot of tourism traffic.  Maybe the bar, although I never had a drink there.",

    "text": "RUDE OWNER, BORING FOOD, TOO SPENDY FOR 'BAR-FOOD'  I work and live downtown, yet have never been to this restaurant. Today I checked the Groupon Now! deal site and saw Steve's offering an $8 for $12 Now! Deal. I decided to try something new, and as I only ever get 'to-go' lunch, confirmed this was allowed to use the deal.   Called in my order ahead, waited the suggested amount of time before heading over, then waited at restaurant for order. Once my order was ready, I was presented with bill for $14.26 ($13 entree + tax). I presented the Groupon worth $12. Server said, \"I'll have to see if I can use this.\" Went to the back area and returned with a female employee. They discussed something I couldn't make out, then server came back to me with bill of $4.26. Before handing him my card, I asked why it was $4.26, instead of $2.26 ($14.26 bill - $12 Groupon = $2.26 balance). Before he could speak, the female employee behind the bar spoke up, rudely and loudly, saying [paraphrased], \"I always add a tip to to-go's, to give these guys a chance to make money. I assume you would tip them anyway.\" I asked her why this wasn't part of the terms, that she is not allowed to force gratuity on a customer when not explicitly stated in the terms. She said, again raising her voice to me unnecessarily, \"I am the owner and have already told Groupon to change the terms to not allow to-go orders. I don't even have to accept it.\" I reminded her that as the customer this is not my issue, but hers with Groupon, and that I am not obligated to pay tip or required to dine-in to redeem this deal, as the deal's terms did not state either. Again, she was extremely rude and loud, saying that the point of the deal was to bring customers in to sit and dine, not to get a to-go.   Deciding it was pointless to attempt to converse such an ignorant individual, I informed her that she lost that opportunity because I would never be back. She continued to speak over me and ignored my attempt at discussing the issue as an adult.   Not sure why she couldn't explain this to me calmly, as a rational 'business owner', but instead allowed the the server to present me with a incorrect bill. Why not personally explain the mistake on the Groupon terms (that they do not allow to-go's on Groupons or that she would request a gratuity included in my charge), and earn a customer, instead of alienating one? . Instead, she successfully removed any chance that I will patron this establishment again.   With all the other delicious, super-friendly, and locally-owned/runned lunch options in the downtown area, I feel patrons should be aware of this business's practices. Not sure about you, but I would rather NOT be inaccurately billed, berated and fussed at by a restaurant employee during my lunch. Your choice!  Oh... and after all that, how did the pasta taste? Eh -- nothing special. Like boiled noodles with canned cream sauce, and two strips of over-cooked chicken. Went to Chipotle instead :)",

It looked it it was going to be a bad lunch when I ordered an arnold palmer and it came out and tasted like tea and water, none of the sweetness of the lemonade, luckily I was able to swap it out for a coke. We asked about the beer specials and our waiter couldn't remember, but stood there for a while trying to, but then gave up.The drunken chicken sandwich was slathered in buffalo sauce instead of the chipotle remoulade which I ordered. The chipotle mac and cheese which was described as penne, came out as spaghetti. When we asked about silverware we were directed to the jars full of knives and forks but no spoons. Storing silverware on the table is disgusting, who knows what was done to it before we sat down. We sat for a while waiting for our check before finally having to ask someone to send our waiter back with it.",

    "text": "After a 5 hour flight from Buffalo to Phoenix (excluding layover time), I anticipated eating at Steve's Greenhouse Grill. Judging by my research on what appeared to be a fresh, lively joint, I was more than ready to check it out once I got settled in my hotel. I was seated promptly and brought an iced water soon after. So far so good. Things quickly began to go downhill after I ordered a beer on tap which was brought to me lukewarm...in a plastic cup. The menu was extensive and offered several unique, funky dishes. I decided on the meatloaf dinner but had to change my order since I was informed by my server they were all out. Despite the large offering of menu items, I went for chicken fingers and fries. My server was kind enough to substitute fries for tater tots upon my request. The dish's description claimed it came with your choice of dipping sauce, so when I asked my server for a side of chipotle bbq sauce, he looked at me like I had just asked him for his first-born child. I retracted and asked if it would be all to have that as a side and he said, \"well, we normally just serve it with ranch...\" He obliged, however, to serve the fingers with the sauce. As he walked away with the menu I directed his attention back to my table and reminded him that a salad came with the meal. He double-checked the menu and confirmed that I was correct.  When the main dish came out, I immediately knew the chicken fingers came frozen from a box. I was expecting homemade chicken fingers, but despite this small setback, I do think frozen chicken fingers are acceptable if they are, well, good. They were small and soggy and obviously were not cooked long enough.  This explained why my food came out so quickly. I was never asked by my server if I needed a refill on my water or my beer. Instead, he cleared my plate and immediately brought my check over, thanked me, and wished me a goodnight. This was completely unacceptable and above all, ruined my entire dining experience at Steve's. My server was not outright rude to me or had a bad attitude, he was just extremely neglectful, had zero personality, and was not very personable. He was too wrapped up in doing his job which shouldn't be a criticism by any means because that's what he should be doing. He was, however, too calculated and did not make me feel welcomed whatsoever, which in my opinion should be every server's main priority. Overall, I was severely disappointed with the food and server at Steve's. Drinks and food were delivered at a fast, efficient pace, though but the bad ultimately outweighed the good.",

The cheese stix were mozzarella sticks (I guess I was expecting cheesy breadsticks or something) and there were 4 in the order (fine for us- we just wanted something small) and the onion rings were unseasoned and only came with ranch (we were really looking forward to the Cajun theme). They have good food specials, too, and seemed really excited for us to have come in, which was nice!",

I figured \"well you can't ruin French fries at least\" - wrong. Burnt- looked like they scooped up the left over pieces of fries at the bottom of the bag and threw them into the fryer.  Update: the hostess is turning people away saying \"sorry we are closed for 20 minutes because there's too many customers and not enough servers.\" There's tons of tables open. Customers are asking \"well can we just sit and wait.\" Her response: \"no. I'll get in trouble by my manager.\" This is bizarre and very awkward - can't wait to get the HELL out of here.",

The food was really good and our waiter was polite. The hash and eggs were really good and the portion size is huge. My daughter said her waffle was the best she had ever had.  My only caution is even though there is a kids menu, it's probably not the best place for kids. The music blasting was rap music with lyrics and words not suitable for kids. Not the restaurants fault, so not a knock on them. Just a word of caution for those with kids.",

Had Alfredo sauce, chipotle seasoning and cheese. Lord it put me in a coma! I about died on the first bite. I've never had a Mac and cheese so tasty before! And get this, I just had a $25 bowl of lobster Mac and cheese from a 4 star restaurant the night before. So this place is a catch! Located on a quiet street downtown, it has a good selection of outside seating and the inside isn't too big. The place can sort of appear to be a hole in the wall dive bar kinda vibe but the place doesn't give the food the justice it deserves. The bathrooms could use a good cleaning bad!  If it was cleaned up I would have given a 4 maybe a 5 Star.",

Tony checked on me to make sure I was taken care of when I was seated.  Super guy, shared with a little history of Steve's with me.    Experience went to the great level when Karla came to take my order.  She recommended mopthe cheeseburger with tater tots and it was a home run!  She swung by to check on me often and made sure my drink stayed topped off. Karla made it a great experience!  They serve breakfast,  Tony recommends the Meat Loaf and eggs,  I'm planning on coming back tomorrow morning to try it.

Redeemed our time here. It is a chill, dive bar type of feel with really kind servers. I had the Santa Fe tortilla wrap. It tasted amazing! Exactly my fave kind of breakfast burrito. Tasted a lot more flavorful than it looked  had a great Bloody Mary with it too. If you're looking for a stuffy, expensive place, this isn't it. We had great, quick service with a yummy breakfast.",

It was a little suspicious since all other restaurants were crammed and there was barely anyone here, but I was getting hangry so we decided to stop in.   There was live music and we ate outside, which wasn't terrible. The menu was a bit confusing - you could get a burger or pizza which is expected for a grill, but they also had a few surprising items like chicken biryani that sprinkled the menu. I was craving pizza so that's what I ordered while my coworkers ordered burgers.   We also got the appetizer sampler, which was pretty good but it's hard to mess up fried food. When my pizza came, after one look I was no longer hungry. I ate about two slices and was done - it tasted maybe like a lunchables pizza that was microwaved. My coworker that ordered a cheeseburger didn't finish, and commented that it was one of few times he didn't finish a burger.   Pretty meh. Only come here if you're starving.",

There were no one else around besides at the bar which seem to be a bunch of drunk people yelling and being inappropriate and also out on the patio.  We ordered drinks, the girl didn't know what alcohol they had and had to come back to tell us. Only two of the four of us got actual drinks. We waited about 15 minutes with no drinks in site and yes this place was MAYBE 1/4 full if that. We got up and another waitress tried to get us to go back to the table.

BUT, two stars for the decent food.  The meatloaf wasn't bad, the green salad was fresh and hearty, and the burger and fries weren't bad either.   For some weird reason service in Phoenix as a whole has been terrible.  Maybe it'll get better as our week here continues.

(The menu is not particularly cohesive in its choices. No real theme.) We decided on the California Burger and added mushrooms. We are not \"fries\" people so we ordered the red potatoes. The food came out fairly quickly but we had to scrounge for silverware and a napkin to no avail until she returned to a different table and we called out. The raspberry lemonade and food was really good. I considered going back in the morning for some bacon, eggs and more potatoes, but maybe next time. (We checked out of the Hyatt early cause the fire alarm went off on the 21st floor and stopped all the elevators. We decided to just get out of Dodge.) We didn't go inside so not sure how clean the bathrooms are but the outdoor patio was clean enough and the food was good. I'd go back for lunch.",

So I decided to talk to the woman in charge. She did take my receipt,comped the bill and apologized saying they were just busy. No excuse but Fine. Now all 3 of us who ordered the crab cakes have the WORST explosive diarrhea! Thanks so much. Yeah are meal was free but we're still paying.

After a couple visits with slow service (as mentioned in other reviews), We ended up with Cathy as our server. She took our orders quick and was on top of refills and the check. She made sure to give us her name and encourage us to request her in the future.   We learned are lesson with several of the other servers, but Cathy makes is feel like we're the most important regulars she has.   Awesome food specials on Wednesday and Thursday ($5 burgers and side and then $.50 hot wings). Great happy hour pricing as well.   Again, not the fanciest place and it's not 5 star food. But if you want good food for a great value with awesome service, swing by Steve's and ask for Cathy. Tell her Taylor sent you.",

There was a slight delay after my meal before asking if I wanted the check or dessert, but overall I was impressed at how attentive the staff was with a full patio for lunch.

Refused to honor the convention discount of 10%.  1st time, the waiter forgot to include the discount.

I mentioned this at the information department of the convention I was attending.  Hope they do something about this.

    "text": "Ok.... So the only reason I even went to this place was because I didn't want to re-park my car after I found out \"Cartel\" was a breakfast joint.... In hindsight, I should have re parked my car.   This place is so very amazingly and exceptionally average. As in like, my stomach was full but not because the food was so good I couldn't help but to eat every last bite, as much it was because I only had an hour for lunch. Wife ordered a \"tortilla soup\" and some type of healthy rice and grilled veggie meal. The soup was barely edible (salty, over spiced and FULL of corn) and the rice was reheated from cold storage and the grilled veggies were soggy. My Reuben was edible. That's about where that stops but for full disclosure purposes, I'm a bit of a Reuben snob. (See former reviews of the Reuben at Windsor) My daughters burger was meh. Fries and tater toys were deep fried in the same grease that was not only old and badly needed to be changed but also used to fry the fish they were serving for the fish and chips. Gross!! Fishy tasting fries!    Service was below average. Waitress not only had a huge case of the \"idontgivadamns\" but wasn't anywhere to be found except to drop off food and take Initial order.  Decor was dated. I could go on and on. I won't return and I highly recommend going anywhere else downtown besides this place. Hell, the hot dog guy on the corner of Jefferson and central is a 100% improvement from this joint.",

    "text": "I have to start off by saying, I only created an account on Yelp to give this terrible restaurant a review.  This was my 2nd visit to this restaurant; I was hoping my first experience was maybe that we just caught them on a bad day.  To start out, the hostess told us there were no seats inside, that the inside tables were only for large parties so we had to sit outside (it was 108 and smelled like nasty beer and mildew). We decided to sit anyway mainly because all the other restaurants near by were packed. Then literally right after she seated us we watched her seat 2 other separate parties of 2 INSIDE!  The tables were dirty, my arms stuck to ours. The glass O' silverware and the salt and pepper shakers were filthy! Like a layer of grey dirt on them. Then it took 20 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were sitting there, I asked the people at the table next to us who the server was and when I asked the girl she states she's not our server and walks back INSIDE! Finally a girl comes to take our drink orders. I wanted to order everything right away because I was afraid nobody would come back (this happened my 1st time visiting as well) and the girl tells me she's not our server either! Seriously?? So we get our drinks, The beer was warm, had a weird odor and had a soured taste. It was bad. I'm guessing their kegs aren't being stored at the correct temperature. So our waitress finally comes out, she was very nice but she disappeared a lot and we had to wait a long time to get beer refills. I found out later that our waitress had been going to stand in the walk in cooler in between checking on the tables (she actually told us this). We got our food after what felt like forever and it was nothing special, not enough seasoning and my tater tots also had onion rings and French fries in it which I'm guessing is because they don't clean their deep fryer. Overall, this place is bad :( I will never go back and I will make sure to let everyone I know not to eat there either.",

It has been a few months since our last visit and today we decided to go back so that we could take my cousin and her boyfriend to our fave spot.  My husband and I were excited taste their yummy wings.  However, that excitement quickly became a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!   Let me start off by saying that the waitress and food from today really sucked!  First, we ordered drinks and they took forever to come back even though the restaurant was nearly empty.  Then, we ordered wings, the chicken tenderloins, and a burger w/ fries. These didn't take that long but when they came out I thought that something was off. The wings were served in a silver bowl where the wings are tossed, which I have NEVER EVER seen done in my visits to this place. No presentation, everything was just blah.... I went ahead and tried them expecting great taste as always but INSTEAD they tasted old and not cooked correctly. They had a very chewy consistency. We normally chow these down but based on how horrible they were my husband did NOT even eat!!  I left most of the wings as well!! And moving on to the tenderloins... I don't know what is going on at Steve's but whatever it is, it's not good!!! The tenderloins looked like they were popped out of a frozen bag and thrown into the fryer. They were chewy and felt hard on the outside! Nothing fresh about them, PLUS THEY TASTED LIKE FISH completely gross!!! Someone is using oil to fry fish and then using it to fry other foods which is totally disgusting!!!!!  The fries that came with the burger tasted just like FISH as well! All of it just totally killed my appetite and we did not even say anything to the waitress because we wanted to get out of there and not make a scene.  I will NOT GO BACK AT ALL!!  I was so disappointed by my experience at Steve's today. I don't know who the person is that is in charge is right now but all I can say is that they're doing a horrible job and killing this place!  In my past visits, the owner: an anglo, short chubby lady with short blonde hair was there and the restaurant was doing well but now it just seems to have GONE TO THE DUMPS!! I wasted my money today but that is ok, at least now I know not to go back and to tell others not to waste their money at this place.",

We were seated then it was about 10 minutes before we even got water (which the host had to get us). Then it took another 20 minutes to have our order taken (drinks & food at the same time due to how long it took). It was another 10 minutes before our partial & incorrect drinks were brought out then another 5 to correct it. We were told 4 times that our food was coming right up which turned out to be almost an hour. At first they brought out only 3 of our 6 plates (none of which were for the 3 hungry & cranky kids). It took almost 10 more minutes to bring out the next 2 plates followed by another 5 minute wait for the 5 y/o's plate (who was darn near in tears because she was so hungry). You'd think after taking that long the orders would at least be correct, right? Nope, 2 of them were wrong... On top of all this, they completely forgot about our appetizers we ordered until we were pretty much done with the food. It seems like this place is severely understaffed but the host blamed it on the waiter & the waiter on the kitchen. All in all, unless that place hires more or better staff, we will never be returning (which is sad being as the food was pretty darn good). So if you have children or are hungry, stay away!",

He graciously said he wasn't going to charge me...nice right, wonder if they would of paid for the helicopter ride to the hospital. They did charge the person I was with for her meal-- you would think the manager (who decided to bill her) would of not charged our table since they ruined our meal out. Besides, the food is basic and pre made. Safe your money and go elsewhere -- this place has no customer service, unkept atmosphere.",

I first ask if I can charge my phone somewhere.  Lazy asshole douchecanoe bartender lazily waves in the direction and says \"Power strip over there.\"  Over where?  I figure it out but guess what.  NO POWER SOURCE.  I know this is first world problems but seriously WHAT THE FUCK PHOENIX NOTHING FUCKING WORKS IN THIS CITY.  So I order the $4 margarita.  It was ok, nothing special. They also seem to have some kind of happy hour food special, like free apps by the non-functioning power strips.   They have two TVs in the joint.  Mind you, this place is like 3 feet from Chase Field and US Airways Arena where the Dbacks and Suns play, respectively.  You'd think they would invest in a package to get out of market games.  Nope.  Now, if you want like local softball teams from Joe's beer league, knock yourself out, but I asked about MLB and they were like \"no.\"  Not even an explanation.  Well fuck you too.  Between the attitude from the bartender (he was such an asshole), the owners (I presume they were the owners) know-it-all righteousness, the bitchy waitresses, well fuck this place in the ass.  I give them an extra star because the margarita wasn't bad.  Oh and the bathrooms were clean and they at least had toilet paper.  Trust me, in Phoenix you can't leave things to chance.",

Every question asked about how something on the menu was prepared she had to go ask in the kitchen. Half the time she forgot to come back with the answer. And it mattered because the friend I was with had several food restrictions so a simple question of what are the vegetables cooked in was never answered. My friends salmon was over cooked and dried out. My sandwich while tasty was put together sloppily so there were large areas of just bread. The capper of the night was we each put down a credit card and asked the server to split the bill equally. She came back having charged one card $8 and the other $16????? I guess the concept of splitting the bill was foreign to her.   The place was crowded before a concert we were going to, the booths in our area were crammed together so it was incredibly noisy and hard to hear our own conversation over all those so closely around us. The seats of our booth were so close together I had to straddle the table leg there was so little leg room. Wont ever be going back there.",

Got here at 10:30am on a Sunday, and there were 6 people in front of me waiting to be seated, even though there were plenty of empty tables. After 10 minutes waiting for a host to acknowledge us, the group of 6 in front of me gave up waiting and left. I was seated soon after, but had to wait another 15 minutes before the server came to take my order.  When my food arrived, it looked and tasted fine, with the exception of the \"fresh fruit\", which featured strawberries with soft brown spots that I was afraid to eat. I sent them back, but after another 10-minute wait to get more fruit, I got tired of waiting and left.  I'm sad to say that I will not return to Steve's.",

One order was apparently overlooked for a while and then they realized they needed to fix it.  I had a Philly Steak and it was pretty bad overall.  The bread was stale and dry.  The meat had been so lazily grilled that a bunch of the sliced meat slices never even got separated.  Only about 3/4's of the roll even had meat and other ingredients on it.  Not much in the way of seasonings.  Pretty lackluster.  Another at our table had the chicken philly and reported pretty much the same about that.  Overall it took almost an hour to get all of the meals served.  The overlooked meal they took off the bill as we had just told the server to forget it and it came out.  The server was fine, we were seated right away and got checked on about the normal amount by the server.  The ambiance of the place would depend on what you like.. Some might say it's \"kitschy\" ...  I'd say it's old and dirty.  The plastic pool chairs we had on the patio were uncomfortable.  The inside looked like you imagine a strip bar floor would look if they ever turned on the lights while you pray that never happens.  The bathroom was old well worn fixtures with evidence of poorly done repairs.  The edges and corners were grimey.",

Both Deb and I ordered our meals with no bread. I guess the chef didn't like that because he put it on both plates anyway with pats of butter. Not that it really matters to me but it's a waste of food to put it on the plate regardless of what the customer says. Also the meatloaf was a bit bland. There was way to much binder in it and they put to much cheese on top to make it taste better. Overall if you want a decent breakfast at a good price this will fit that bill.",

We bought a group on and hoped that we would be one of the people who had a 4/5 star experience and not a 1. Waitress was very nice and food was prepared adequately.  They were helpful when we asked a couple of questions.   Honestly, I think what people mind is the decor-we realize that it's a sports bar, but the patio was not ideal to sit in, the inside felt as if it could use a major facelift and they had their paper products (cups, napkins, etc) in full view of all the customers. Someone was right there to seat us immediately.  it was an okay experience",

Following the symphony yesterday five of us chose Steve's over one across the street and an hour and half later we were furious we had made the change. We waited 10 minutes for water; another 5-10 to place an order and another 35 for our food. It was not very full at that time. Every patron in the place was ready to walk out. We chatted with several people around us. Not only did we wait over 45 minutes for burgers, they came out cold - cold enough they were practically inedible. The crab sandwich was equally as bad. We discovered our waitress was the manager and when we called her attention to the food, she did offer to re-cook the three burgers, but we had no desire to sit for another half hour waiting for that to happen. The service and the food were terrible. We discussed not paying or walking out even before the food came out, but we chose to be polite. Don't waste any money or time on this restaurant. Sorry...",

The service, however has been regretfully terrible each time. EACH TIME we waited 8-10 minutes before we were even greeted by our servers. At one visit it was actually 17 minutes from entry before we were even brought our drinks. The servers never come to see how your food is or to refill drinks. Twice, I've had to ask them to prebus the table. Twice, it has taken the server 10 minutes to actually run our card and return the bill to us. It's disappointing, we live 2 blocks away and have been looking for a place like this to call our home away from home. Decent food, decent price, terrible service every time.

She didnt even ask us before she tore them in two. She also assumed we would want fries to cover for the missing half eggroll. My co worker had to ask if there were any other options if she didnt want the fries.The food was mediocre. At the end of our visit, another co worker caught an error on her check.

We accidentally spilt a water and no employees came to help us clean, after telling a hostess, still no assistance came to clean-up or refill water. We were brought our food, one of us ordered a Breakfast Burrito, menu said included potatoes, no potatoes came in burrito.  Once our food was dropped off our server not once came back to check on us, we could see him in the Kitchen, on his phone, and watching TV. We had to grab the attention of a different server and ask for our check.  As we walked out, our server was sitting at the bar, on his phone. Seams like it could be a cool place, but all staff lacked attention to customers.",

    "text": "If giving less than 1 star was a possibility, I would've definitely done that. Our experience at Steve's Greenhouse Grill tonight will go down as one of the WORST experiences I've ever had. Earlier in the day we made our reservation for a large party at 9pm. We arrived on time and the restaurant was pretty much vacant with the exception of a few patrons in the bar area. We were seated immediately and that's where things took a turn for the worst. Our waitress took her time bringing menus and taking drink orders and due to the later hour, we made our food choices quickly. After waiting quite some time for her to return to take our orders, we then proceeded to wait some more(beginning to see a theme here?). Several in our party got up to use the restroom and found our absent waitress primping in the mirror of the bathroom. Finally, now OVER 40 minutes later, salads and soups began to trickle out to the table in random order. At least 3 of us received incorrect orders and had to ask for replacements. The food that did arrive was subpar at best. Out of 20 people, 14 people received their order near the same time and began to eat. After a 15 minute grace period, we began to question when the remaining dishes would be served. Fast forward 1 hour and 45 minutes into our dinner and 4 people has STILL not received their meals. During this time at least 2 plates were returned for incorrect items and/or terrible flavor. At the 2 hour mark, when we still had not received a completed order we asked that the rest of the items be cancelled and removed from our check. The management refused our request and promised the food would be out immediately. Of course, the food that came soon after was NOT what we had ordered. At first, because our waitress was MIA, we had to track down other employees to help us with our concerns. When there was no improvement, we attempted to speak to the manager. He was ineffective, unconcerned and unwilling to accommodate his patrons requests for help. I ordered a salad and grilled cheese and had water to drink. I was never once offered a refill on my water and hence, never received one. My grilled cheese was about 1/16 of an inch thick and looked like it had been made out of Wonder bread and Kraft singles, by a toddler. When the waitress was around, our initially polite requests were met with irritable sighs and eye rolls. Her attitude, customer service and job performance were BEYOND awful. If I were the owner of this business, I would be absolutely mortified. Both by the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the behavior of the staff. If I were the owner of this restaurant, come tomorrow morning, I would fire both the manager and the waitress. Both of those individuals gave his/her restaurant a TERRIBLE name. I hope EVERYONE who took the time to read this review chooses to take their business and their money elsewhere. Between the awful food and the terrible service, you'd be better off staying home and having your toddler make you a grilled cheese.   *UPDATE* Returned this afternoon to speak to the owner regarding our experience the prior evening. She was incredibly kind, respectful and listened intently to our concerns. She was appalled by her staff's behavior and promised to deal with them accordingly. I genuinely appreciated her response and she made me believe there may be hope for Steve's yet. I hope she will hire a new manager that will support her business and help to make it successful in the future.",

I ordered a plain bacon cheeseburger and when it arrived it came with everything on it. When I told her I said \"plain\" she simply said \"oh, okay\" and walked away. With the help of some some napkins that I reached over from the bar I removed the lettuce and tomato. She never came around to see how I was doing or if I needed a refill even though my cup was empty for at least 10 minutes. It wasn't busy so there wasn't really any excuse for the delay.  It took another 10 minutes to get my check,  I decided to pay cash cause I knew if I paid with my card she'd take longer.  This place definitely needs to train its staff with better customer service.",

Too bad he forgot to mention that it's just a tortilla and meat... and NOT the street tacos... so the tacos get a 1 Star... (bland but not tasteless) but I may have changed my order had I known they came naked.  Fortunately I also ordered chips and salsa, so at least I was able to drop some of that on there.  Decent Bloody Mary and I liked the wonton chips... Though \"dusted w/Cajun seasoning\" should be used very loosely. The salsa had a nice kick to it.   For being an essentially empty establishment when I arrived, service was in the slower side, but more frequent check-ins once he got us started... and was friendly.  The place was average. 2.5 stars if I could, but I'll go 3.",

I don't blame her for the remainder of my experience. The food along w/ the drinks were just awful.   The bartender making the alcoholic beverages needs to take a step back and taste his/her own drinks. They were unbearable. With the exception of the mango margarita, the drinks we ordered were better off in the trash.   The food wasn't any better. One minor inconvenience- had we not read through our entire bill, we would have been charged an extra $10 for a drink we didn't order.   I think it's always best the server checks the receipt to ensure the bill is correct. Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say -  I'm sure there are much better places in the surrounding area.",

    "text": "I was trying out this new place for the first time. It looked like a cool place to have lunch and some drinks. Yet I was really disappointed. We were sat down in a comfortable area and waited for our waitress.  We waited about 15 min. At 115 degrees outside, I was very thirsty and the wait was only making it worse. Finally, she arrived and took our orders. We ordered two burgers, an appetizer, some drinks, and, of course, water. Our drinks were quick but the happy hour beers were served in small plastic water cups like the ones given at fast food restaurants. This was not good at all, especially at 4.50 each. I had ordered my burger medium well, but when I took the first bite into my food, I found it was rare/raw. I asked to exchange it for a properly cooked burger which was done very quickly.   As for the waitress she was really nice and careful with what she was doing. Although it felt like she was a little overwhelmed with work. It would of been a great help to have the 4 to 5 other employees that were just sitting around talking and not doing anything else to at least give her a hand. I have worked in restaurants before and was told \"if you have time to lean you have time to clean.\"  I was very disappointed to see the way the employees worked at this place. They were just lazy and having their social hour while getting paid. This should be addressed immediately or money is just being lost.  As for the TV channel selection, I would advise that they should choose something that may intrigue someone, instead of just infomercials on water cleaning systems. This just made me want to eat and drink as quickly as possible to leave. Maybe if the drinks were not so small and they were served in proper mugs/glasses and if there was something decent to watch, I would of stayed much longer and spent more money. Also noticed that this place seemed very run down there were decorations on the wall that seemed like someone ran a knife through it. All the lighting fixtures were also broken or burnt out. There needs to be some investment in making the place look better.  Overall, this place was one of the worst places I have ever decided to spend money at for food and entertainment in the Phoenix area. I can almost guarantee that if something drastic does not happen for the better, it will soon go out of business. Especially, with all the great grill and bars around the neighborhood.",

So I got six honey hot. It was nice and saucy and delicious! The skin is nice and crunchy and big pieces. My coworkers got the hot, they didn't come with sauce like I'm used to and all of them were served with blue cheese. Want ranch? You have to ask for it.  I got the Fish & Chips with house salad. Sorry about the picture, by the time I remember to take one I had already dug in! LoL Okay, the whole meal was huge and I pushed food on my coworkers and still had to waste some of it. The house salad is a big serving. A huge helping of shoe string fries that I piled on a plate and handed over to my coworkers, the few I had were tasty. The fish are bigger than my hand and I was given 2 pieces. It was good with the tarter sauce that wasn't JUST tarter sauce, it had some kind of orange tint to it. Hot sauce? But it was delicious and I could only eat one.  The fruity tea I got was delicious, freshly brewed - ask for extra ice.  My coworker got the soup of the day, cream of potato bacon. It had huge chunks and my coworker said it was delicious. Two coworkers got the BLT half sandwhich and it came with heaping pile of bacon that looked extra crispy and something I would get next time.  We all said next time we're downtown, we'll be stopping here.",

Location is great but service and the food quality was definitely subpar There were a lot of empty tables and no coordinated seating/hostess effort at the front. They told us they were slammed and there would be a wait bc the kitchen was backed up. We weren't in a hurry so we decided to stay.... we should have walked off. The servers kept apologizing for the wait and told us they had closed the restaurant so the kitchen could catch up. Again, there were a lot of empty tables. I ordered the red flatbread. An hour later the food came.  My flatbread came out too soggy  to pick up and yet burnt on the bottom and edges. We reordered it. The second one was cooked better but not particular tasty. My husband ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, which came out as a piece of chicken with a slice of cheese and a \"mayo chipotle\" that was more salad based dressing with relish? than mayo - nothing like the menu description. The order for a third person in our party was forgotten. Too bad because the proximity to the convention center is great and the front of house staff was friendly. The menu looks good but the food quality isn't. We won't go back there with so many other good bar style places nearby.",

Walk in and the place is packed - much to be expected during Phoenix Comicon. Menu selection wasn't the best, but I ordered anyway because I was hungry and my boyfriend picked the place. Took a while to get our food - understandable due to Phoenix Comicon. When we get our food, DISGUSTING.   I have never, in my 23 years of life, had to salt  burger I've ordered from a restaurant. I ordered a medium burger, got something that was thrown on the grill for 10 seconds on each side. I ate it thinking it was just me being picky but it really was undercooked and gross. The Jalapenos were the only thing keeping me eating the damn burger, and throwing salt and their salsa on it. Fries were just a hard pile of grease.  While we were trying our best to eat this stuff, I notice the wait staff hanging in their corner all at the exact same time, not tending to any tables. I let the eating food in the corner slide because I figured they had been busting their asses all day busy with convention goers, but they just stood their chattering for about 10 minutes when they could be wiping tables or clearing tables or whatever. They were just plain lazy, all except for the guy with the camo avengers shirt and the dish bucket.  Our table was so full and cluttered with useless crap that didn't need to be there. There was barely enough space for our food on the table.  They didn't ask us whether we wanted a booth or table. The regular tables were uncomfortable, YET I was in a seat that faced an empty booth that looked much more comfortable. Would've been nice to know my options.  Huge group of kids show up and they're screaming their heads off all hyper and stuff. Which I understand, BUT do you seriously have to yell, \"WHO WANTS BURGERS? WHO WANTS SPAGHETTI?, Just ask the kids individually and treat them like a normal person. This isn't a damn school field trip and it was very annoying for everyone else in the restaurant, not just me.  After we tried to digest the meal we just had, I wanted to be far away from that place as possible. Get to our hotel room and, just my luck, FOOD POSIONING. So, thank you, so much, for ruining my Phoenix Comicon experience AND my Friday night. Whatever tip my boyfriend gave the waitress was NOT well deserved at all, and I don't say that often (or ever).",

However, service was terrible from the beginning--there was no hostess and we waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  We ordered street tacos, a cowboy cheeseburger (cooked medium), white chicken chili and a quesadilla.  It took about 30-45 minutes to receive our food.  The burger was burnt to a crisp, tacos were cold, quesadilla very greasy, and chili had hardly any chicken.  There were not many people in the restaurant, but the server did not give us the attention and care expected.  We wanted to support a local business, but we will not return.",

Most of us already know this is not the best place downtown to eat, but its late. Venture in at 10:34, very not busy at all. So we get drinks, a few just get water and a couple cups of coffee. Now 11:10 ish, we have been talking to another server who is not our server about events around the convention, wondering if he has seen our server, people want a refill on drinks, questions about where the food is. 11:17 or so the server we had been speaking to gets the manager for us and begins telling us how busy they are. Actually, the entire inside is a ghost town, they are still seating what few people are walking up on the patio. As my friend Ryan is dicussing what is going on with the manager, the onion rings arrive almost an hour after we were seated. Like four people reach for one at the same time, not even hot, as we get up to leave, the balls displayed by this manager asking if we were gonna pay for the drinks was just astounding.",

I would not eat here again if it was free. The bright side is, Blue Moon for $3 and a guy out on the curb playing guitar, made it okay.

I'm not posting just for this though. It's all about their WINGS! They have the best, let me repeat, The Best chicken WINGS I've eaten anywhere in the Phoenix valley. You can get them fried or grilled, but fried is the way to go in my opinion. The Chipotle Honey hot sauce is amazing, but they offer quite a few other flavors such as BBQ, Parmesean, and Garlic. What makes them the best is their size. There are not your ordinary buffalo wild WINGS bite size. These are huge, juicy WINGS made to get dirty..  Their drink specials compliment their WINGs well and I suggest to GO on Thursday, as that is .50 cent wing day!!! Cheers",

Besides the wait for the order the margarita tasted like luke warm salt water... we aren't people to send people to send drinks back but these were too terrible to try and finish. Once we said something they rushed out and erased the margaritas off the menu, the waiter was the most awkward experience, and I would never recommend this place to someone as I will not be returning.",

    "text": "Came here with my family tonight around 8:30 pm. Obviously, it's very packed and busy since its in the heart of downtown and there are Super Bowl events occurring. My mother ordered wings (amazing) I ordered the Sonoran Tuna Melt and my father ordered the 8oz sirloin with a Caesar salad and veggies. Our server was a nice guy who was very prompt with bringing out our food. My dad ended up receiving a steak sandwich instead of the 8 oz sirloin . We politely asked if we could return it and get his correct order. A few minutes later, a food runner handed my dad his plate and quickly ran away. They literally took the bread off and gave it back to my dad. Strike one. We understand you are busy, but if you aren't going to do something right the first time, at least have it right the second time. A manager came around (plumper woman) and we asked if we could have his correct order. By this time, my mother and I were almost finished eating. Finally, she returned with the steak. Except he asked for medium rare and when he cut into it, it was basically still bleeding. Strike two. She was standing next to us when he cut into it and she asked if it was okay. At this point, my dad is frustrated and explains the situation to her again. She rolled her eyes and took it away. Strike three. My dad ate his salad, didn't touch the cold veggies and he never received his steak. He walked out hungry. My parents frequent quite a few restaurants downtown as they live there. You will not be receiving our business again nor would I recommend to any friends. And if the female manager of this establishment happens to read this, I'm a server. I know how the game goes. My managers don't roll their eyes at their guests (my father in this situation) when a mistake is made on their part. I suggest you review your customer service skills as well as management skills. Also, that was me you pushed the door into while in the lady's room and you skipped me in line. Good luck in the real world.",

We waited forever for our food....long after those that arrived after us received their food! Never once did we see the waiter. Just as we were about to ask for our check to just pay for out one round of drinks and leave he came out with our food....and it was cold! I asked for malt vinegar for my fish....big mistake!! It was expired and sour smelling....even had brown foam on top! Conveniently the part of the label with the expiration date on it was missing. I refused to touch anything else. Twice the waiter walked by...never asked how food was or acknowledged us. When he finally came to see if we were done he asked if I needed a box....told him vinegar was expired...he smelled it...made a face and agreed. I told him to take my food off of the bill....I didn't eat ok. No apology...and nothing...walked away! Came back with our check...said nothing and walked away! Unbelievable! My daughters food and my husbands food was cold and tasted to them like it had been sitting around a long time..I don't doubt it. My daughter tried bathroom...dirty...small and couldn't turn the water on to wash her hands! We will not be back and I sure hope....if you're reading this....you don't try it either. Anything would be better than this dump! Ew!",

They have a very interesting menu, it seems pretty standard diner fare but it is obvious that they provide fresh, healthy options whenever possible.   My friend and I went for lunch yesterday and we both had burgers. I had a bacon cheeseburger subbed with bleu cheese, my friend had an ostrich burger. I liked hers, l you could tell it is a leaner meat, but it was a little too birdy for me; I will stick to my moo burger.  I ordered my burger medium and it was done exactly so. Both were served on wheat buns. I also had the \"Famous\" tortilla soup which was very good with wonton chips on top, and also tried my dining partner's white chili which was made with chicken.  The service was very friendly and efficient even during the downtown lunch rush. The bathrooms are cute but tiny, and you enter through the kitchen. This isn't a place I will crave, but definitely somewhere I'd stop by again for a nice outdoor lunch (except they allow smoking on the patio..ick. is that even legal? Definitely not 25 feet from the door...)",

When we sat indoors, the service was good, the food was prompt and well prepared (hot). When we were seated outdoors, the service was poor and inattentive and the food was slow and poor (cold).  We were there tonight and the service was terrible. The server dropped the salad (one of two) on the table and scurried off. We weren't sure whose salad it was since both of us ordered salad but only one came. There was no table setup and salad is not a finger-food in my world. When we finally saw him again, he gave us a jar of silverware but no napkins and there was no indication of whose salad it was or where the other one was. Finally, we flagged him down again and at least got napkins. Apparently, the salad was mine. It was lettuce with one wedge of tomato and fried tortilla strips. It was terrible.   When the entrees finally arrived, my salmon was overcooked and dry and the vegetables were cold. My friend's fish tacos were cold. We didn't see the server again until it was time to bus the dishes and bring our checks. He was prompt about that! Then he mixed the checks up and gave me her change. Really? It was horrible.

My wife had a turkey deal. Some kind of sandwich. She liked it very well, as well.   My only \"beef\" was my waitress brought me a bottle of ketchup with no ketchup and a big poop for me is having my diet coke run dry. And it ran dry folks!

This was my first time to Phoenix, we stayed at the Hyatt - Steve's is right across the street.  Our first morning we went for breakfast.  Our waitress was so adorable!!  She was friendly and related well to all of us.   My BF loves corned beef hash but NOT from a can.  Our waitress confirmed it was real fresh corned beef hash - it was the best we've ever had out!   I had the belgian waffle with strawberries -that was ok.  My son had the french toast - that was really good!  Later that night our dinner plans got canceled so we went back.  BF got the buffalo burger - it was a little dry, but buffalo is.  It had a great taste and they were very accommodating to everything he wanted on it.  I had the meatloaf sliders - the best meatloaf I've ever had - better than mine and that's saying a lot.   The waitress said that was new on the menu.   My son had the chicken wings - they give you 12 chicken wings for $8.  In CA you'd get 4.   And, they had several flavors of chicken wings to choose from.  The wings were great!!  Oh, and my BF got tater tots with his burger - SOOOOOOO good.  Perfectly crispy yet soft and yummy inside.  They had 4 TV's inside and 2 outside.  We had a great view of two games!!  We already plan on going back to Phoenix and going back to Steve's!!!!!!",

The problem, for me, was the not-so-clean restaurant.  It was DIRTY.  The container the glasses were in, the table, the seats, the floors, everything.  I would like to blame this on a busy morning, but we were there first thing.  We were the first people to sit at the table for the day.  GROSS.  The food was ok, but I had a really hard time getting over the dirtiness.  Clean up, Steve's!",

We arrived and were asked for our order after about 5 minutes. Not bad but it got much worse from the on.   After another 15 minutes drinks were finally delivered. The problem was we ordered vodka tonics and received vodka and cranberry juice.  We stated that was not out order and they took them back to get the correct drinks.  15 minutes later still no drinks.  We are at a total of about 35 minutes now waiting on drinks.  My friend finally walked to the bar to see about the drinks.  The bar tender was extremely rude saying oh you mean the vodka cranberry drinks I made.  She explained that wasn't what we ordered and he decided to make the correct drinks.  Now that we finally got drinks another 20 minutes passed and we still don't have food. Mind you the table behind us placed there order after we did and they have received there food and are finished by this time.   We have been there almost a hour by now.  I complained to the waiter letting him know we needed to be at a concert said he could just bring us our check for the drinks.  Totally shocked I said you are really charging is for drinks that we waited 35 minutes for and had to get ourselves.  He said he would send a manager over.  Manager was useless, just didn't want us to leave on our food order.  Surprisingly food arrives soon after the manager walked over - we order flatbread that was cold and tasteless.  It was awful!   We asked for the bill and we were being charged for everything.  No attempt at making up for their horrible service at all.   The manager finally took 1 drink off the bill - very big of him!   I guess when your restaurant is this bad you are used to people complaining.  I would give zero stars if possible.",

We ordered burgers - with fried onion straws for me, ostrich burgers for my friend, and we both agreed that the burgers were good. The fries were cut thin, almost shoestring style, and unfortunately were too dry. For the friendly service, relaxing atmosphere, and our not-too-spectacular food experience, I'd give the place 3 stars.",

Nice patio for outside dining, which is what my wife and I opted for last week on a perfect spring evening. Our server was quick to take our orders (it was a pretty slow night, but hey, it was a Monday), and was very attentive to us our entire visit. The food was decent enough. I had the Chile Burger and my Wife had the Ostrich burger (which I actually thought was overpriced.... $12.95 for a 6oz patty... hmmmm). The fries and the potatoes that came on the side were really good though!   From what my friends have told me, this is one of the best happy hour spots (price wise) in downtown Phoenix! We were there after happy hour and the drink prices were still pretty cheap! I'm definitely planning on dining/drinking here again!  Lastly, I gotta give a shout out to Vinny! The dude is probably one of the nicest, most genuine people out there! Anyone would be lucky to have him as your server at Steve's!!",

We ordered food and drinks and were enjoying ourselves until the resident street people came around ...along with the owners.  As the woman owner walked in she appeared to try and become confrontational with us but then went inside.  Just after that, our party was told we wouldn't be served anymore and were cut off.  After we explained that none of us were driving they graciously let us stay for a brownie with a candle in it. We were then told we had to leave after I went in to talk to the waitress and the male owner tried to stop and listen to what I was saying to her which made me stop talking until he walked away.  That's when we were cut off.  It was a clear and vulgar display of power. It seemed as though the owners bought a bar so that they and their friends could drink.  I can see now why it was empty.  Good luck with that.",

Secondly it was $5 burger night and a turkey burger was included but you could not order any toppings a regular burger had unless they charged you per topping.. odd when turkey was \"included in the deal\" .  Then.... I bit into it.. it was okay.. and then.. as I pulled the burger away from my mouth after the 3rd bite something held on.. a hair lingered in between the burger and my teeth. Not mine.  They made me a new one and the manager never came around or apologized and they still charged me.  Last time I had a hair in my food they made me a new plate and comped my meal and management even apologized ..mishap forgiven; customer service cherished,  and I still go with love in my heart for the place and the delicious food. Not this place! I understand that randomness and mishaps happen, but to not treat a customer with respect afterward does not deserve my appraise.  Props to the new waitress who had to deal with it, however your management should go back to hospitality school.  What a shame. It could be an awesome place, great seating indoors and out, and even some live music.. much potential. I hope it gets better. Good luck.",

They're not gourmet type more like the cake your grandma would make after picking the meat from crabs she just caught from crabbing. Food isn't pretentious and neither is the crowd. Go for a meal -albeit a lil slow with service - and nice time out.",

There were 9 of us and the place looked like it would be able to fit us. Looked empty inside. We were hungry so asked the guy standing outside if he room. He said \"hold on let me check. This might be your lucky day\" while looking at his empty dining room. Then starts telling other people who are waiting on a table that they were running out of food. When they questioned him on what he does have his response \"what do you mean. We have a full menu\" but you just said you were out of food. \"No. I said we were out of fish\" then the host continues to argue with the other guests. We decide to leave and he gets upset with us saying that if we stay he would give all of our drinks free.",

    "text": "I ran across one of my friend's reviews of this place on Facebook. I experienced poor service here as well during a political event nearby & so I feel compelled to share his experience as well.  ***TL;DR Version: If you're near the con today, be wary about eating at Steve's Greenhouse Grill. Tony, one of the managers, is completely oblivious to good customer service. One of the servers even said this. I'm not a scene-causing person and he pissed me off enough to do it.***  Anyone who knows me, knows that it takes a lot to make me angry. I try to be very understanding with people in the service industry. I'm not a big \"let me speak to the manager\" type of person, unless it's absolutely necessary. Last night, after PCC, I hung out with my friends at Steve's Greenhouse Grill (across the street from Networks). Service was painfully slow, but I chalked that up to being busy with the con crowd. At the end of the night, my bill was $7 more than it should've been. Turns out they gave us an old menu, with old drink prices. We asked to speak to the manager, which made the servers oddly uncomfortable. When I brought this up to Tony, the manager, he decided to fight me on it. \"It was an honest mistake that we left that menu on your table, but that's what the prices are. It's still cheaper than everywhere else around here.\" After telling him that wasn't the point, he took my receipt to \"correct\" it. He docked $3. After asking him what that was about, he says \"I gave you a discount. So, we're good? Are you gonna come back?\" Which was a weird thing to ask. I objected and told him that he should honor the prices on the menu given to us. He took my receipt and \"corrected\" it again. He took the discount off and put the original overcharged price back on. I was pissed. He then said to me \"Well, I tried to help you, and you didn't like it, so now you have to pay the whole bill.\" At this point, it was beyond about being overcharged. I may have thrown a few, or a lot of profanities at this guy. One of the servers tried to diffuse the situation by offering me $7 of her own tips, which I refused. The other servers even whispered to me \"just go,\" encouraging me to skip out on the bill. They obviously disliked this manager. I told them that I wanted to take care of the bill with the owner, when she came in the next day. What ended up happening, was an off-duty manager was sympathetic to my situation, so he went and told Tony to take the $7 off. After paying the bill, Tony borderline sarcastically says \"I apologize. Have a nice night,\" to which I sarcastically responded \"You too!\" In typical Comic Book Guy delivery: Worst. Manager. Ever.",

Someone else walks in sitstwo seats down from me and gets served right away. I brought it to that servers attention and she said she didn't know which was understandable but as a customer coming on lunch it is frustrating the restaurant wasn't even busy it had two semi large parties and a few sprinkled here and there but that's all I've been there on busier days at busier times.

    "text": "Came here for the first time on a Sunday for lunch with a party of 3. It was literally right in front of the Hyatt regency doors where we were staying and so I was like okay cool. I'm a huge carnivore so the fact that I saw the word \"green\" in greenhouse grill, I wasn't so thrilled to try it out coz I knew it would probably be really healthy and quite possibly not have meat options.  We sat down just in time before it got busy. Looking at the menu, prices were $13+ for much more filling foods like the pasta and chicken menu. They come either with soup or salad. I ordered the white chicken chili for my soup and Tuscan chicken breasts. Now, I hate soup but it came with it so I had to pick the wiser choice that came with meat. I am happy to say that I was surprised it was actually really good. Seriously good. My Tuscan chicken breasts that is covered in Parmesan and pesto was good but I felt that the pesto was a little bit strong. The meat wasn't too dry or too juicy. Roasted seasoned potatoes were good and my fruit cup was delicious, absolutely.  The service? Uhh not a huge fan. Sometimes they take forever to come back and check on your table. At one point, our waitress did not come back for a while that I had to go inside the restaurant since we were seated outside, and go ask for a glass of water in the bar and I brought it to my table. Also, just double check your silverware that it's clean. I don't think the waitress realized that she got some of the white chicken chili soup on my glass of water on the rim.  Overall, as a carnivore, this place is a good choice if you're trying to eat a meat healthy option or if you stay at the Hyatt and you have to be close to your hotel for your flight.",

When we were finally seated--only after making a stink--it took almost 20 minutes and two requests to even hear from a server, who still has said almost nothing to us.

An incredibly beautiful October afternoon with temps going up, sitting outside in the shade was delightful, including the many birds and people-watching from this excellent location.  I was seated promptly, it was $6 burger day, so why not? My sweet and seemingly feisty waitress helped me figure out which one (the Cowboy Burger, and it was great), with a $3 on tap Blue Moon beer. Served on a camping type plate, this was just casual enough, and inexpensive enough but delicious enough to last a long time.   This is perfect for watching sports and hanging around downtown. Think World Series!  I read previous reviews about the staff. I experienced some confusion when delivering my beer, but when I asked the hostess, I found her delightful and helpful. The confused busser was equally kind. My waitress? Great personality and attentive service!   It's a casual place and I'd recommend it with enthusiasm.",

I would consider the place a three star average despite moments of slowdown due to handling the crowds of people. Fast forward to now and the place has gone downhill steadily. Service got slower. People got angrier. Average food became bad food because everything else was negative. The only positive I can give about this place is that you get a chair to sit in to relax a little after walking all day.   I can't say anything negative about the manager as I never had to deal with him and most times, the servers were good to me. I seem to be one of the luckier ones in this regard though.

We were told \"im too busy for that, anything but that.\" We then were told he thought he was out of wontons but he would check (he never did). We were given a total of 1 min to look at the menu before being asked to order (not if we had enough time to look). I got the chicken cordon blue. After each of us said our order the waiter responded \"ok give me your menu\". Food came quick but there was a reason for this. I got a grilled cheese with what tasted like a microwaved chicken patty on it. My friend got the fettachini which i was told had less flavor then a microwave dinner. My other friend didnt have complaints on the burger hence the star i gave them.",

We LOVED it. Will go back again with no groupon/coupons-yes they were that good. I got the blacked pork chops. They came with House potatoes, mixed veggies and a roll. 2 pork chops. My husband got the green chili burger. I had never had blacked pork chops- They were the reason for the 5 starts. Total FLAVOR!! I'm so tired of flavorless food or food that I have to cover up with condiments. The wait staff were very nice and they refilled drinks before they were empty ( I think that's a plus in the AZ heat) Oh yeah- sports were on the tvs if your in to that...my husband was.",

I saw her irk numerous customers with her behavior. She kept a long line of customers standing out front, waiting to be seated, for about 15 minutes, even though there were several empty tables on the patio and inside. She shouted orders to the various wait staff and rushed around, very unprofessionally and unnecessarily.  I asked for a side of milk with my tea when I ordered my breakfast. The tea was served sans milk, so when I could finally get my waitress's attention (about 10 minutes into my meal), I requested the milk again. She said she'd go grab it. By the end of my meal, I still didn't have it, so I asked for the tea to be removed from my bill. No one apologized to me for the SNAFU. My waitress even acted irritated with me about it.  The food was actually decent (I had the huevos rancheros), so it was extra disappointing that the restaurant had so many other issues.",

Loads of fresh veggies on the Quesadilla. Crab cake was amazingly good. The kids pasta had the best sauce on it and it was made just perfect. The rolls and the burger bun were so good.  Yes the waitress was borderline rude but did her Job very quickly and efficiently. She was working on a thanksgiving day won't blame her if she was in foul mood in an understaffed place. Glad to find a great place in downtown Phx. Three entries and a kids meal came out to 37 + tax so very reasonable as well for the location.",

Shortly after, manager came out and apologized for the misunderstanding. She made sure the bar opened back up for us.  The servers did a great job taking our orders right away. Our orders were taken, food and drinks served and consumed all within 1 hr and 15 minutes. That was the best service we had gotten for being such a big group.

I initially sat at the bar since there was no one outside to seat me, and the bartender didn't even acknowledge the fact I was there, busy cleaning or something.  He wasn't fixing drinks.  So I got up and stopped one of the servers and asked her if someone could seat me, give me a menu or something, and she went to find a hostess.  She came back and said they ignored her so she proceeded  to seat me in her section, which I was thankful for, since I was able to finally order.  They claimed to be serving brunch all day but didn't have a brunch menu, and when I tried to order a blt they wouldn't even let me order one without the egg, as if it would be too much trouble.  Their 2.5 stars are well-earned!",

So I ask her how much the \"fish and chips\" special is? Again crickets. I was then like okay can I just order a burger then? She then proceeds to tell me she is not a waitress but a hostess and that my waitress will be put in \"a few\". Ooookay. I wait another 5 minutes waitress comes to take order fine. In the mean time I watch not 1 but TWO other people get up and leave because no one is serving them. 20 minutes after waiting for my meal, the waitress sends over a bus boy to ask me what I had ordered  I dumbfoundedly repeat my order and away he goes. 10 more minutes goes by and I ask the hostess when my food will be out? Her reply \"I don't know I'm not the waitress\" and then goes back to her podium. Another 5 minutes go by and the bus boy brings me my food no other stops or refills were made to my table until I GOT UP and went to the counter for my check. Absolutely ridiculous and horrible service. The only reason they got 2 stars was because there food was actually good. I would avoid here if you want fast/friendly/ or knowledge employees",

I enjoyed my blackened chicken, however the chicken wasn't really 'blackened'- it was just kinda grilled lol. I didn't mind though- the honey mustard tasted good. The Cajun pasta, however, was a little too spicy for my flavor. I know it's 'Cajun' style, but it left such a hot aftertaste in my mouth that it felt a bit much.   I can see Steve's being a cool little spot to grab a burger from every now and then if i was from the PHX area.

Which means when your total breakfast tab is less than 20 bucks, you are going to pay 12 bucks for parking unless you are lucky enough to get a spot with a meter right in front of the restaurant.  Oh, and there are no signs that tell you they don't valiate parking - you just get to learn it the hard way.  Or read this - and simply skip this place.  Trust me, you aren't missing anything - there are plenty of other great places within a 5 block radius to go to breakfast.",

We also wanted to eat outside.  Our server was terrible. He offered not options when we asked what was on tap and if they had any wheat beers. He said they didn't have any and didn't offer up the drink menu. Sigh.  We started with the \"spicy\" onion rings. Basically onions rings sprinkled with season sauce. Tasty none the less, although not spicy! I did a chicken sandwich - they did not cut the tendon out, so chomping into that sucked. The coleslaw was ok. Hubby wanted the Cajun sausage sandwich and said - the Cajun sausage. Also said no veggies. The waiter assumed he wanted the main pasta dish...  which was awful. Tasteless Alfredo sauce. Our companion for the meal got the crab cake sandwich, he didn't want the wheat bun and his only other options was sour dough bread. The crab was not tasty.  The front patio is a great location to hang out, but just don't go with great expectations. And grab a drink menu on the way in!",

Tonight we did after a Diamondbacks game. I'm very glad we did.   We just ordered burgers but they were the best we've had in a long time. I'm one of those weirdos that likes my burger medium or medium rare and even places that let me pick how I want it cooked always bring it to me well done. I never send it back but just eat my dry overcooked tasteless burger. I didn't have to do that here though. The meat was perfect. I ordered the cowboy burger minus the BBQ sauce. ($8.50) The patty was good sized and came topped with a thick slice of tomato, a good portion of Romain lettuce and a thick slice of red onion lots of bacon, cheese and onion straws. I chose the grilled potatoes as my side. They turned out to be sliced red potatoes grilled with some green chili's. Yummy. My BF chose the French fries. They were good also. Shoestring style. Crispy with almost a battered texture. We chose to sit on the patio where a they had a guitarist playing. Entertaining with out being overbearing. My bf even tipped him when we left (something he rarely does).   All in all a really good experience. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. The only thing that kept it from being prefect was the Cole slaw was bland and although the waitress was efficient she just didn't have much of a personality. But now I'm just splitting hairs. It was a great casual dinner",

That night Steve's was transformed from a quaint lunch spot into an open-air discotheque. Amazing.  The patio was packed with Crawlers enjoying their breakfast and dancing to crowd-pleasers like Cupid's \"Shuffle\" and LMFAO's \"Shots,\" with a beer in one hand and yummy bacon in the other. There were moments when I actually forgot where I was and I was sober as a judge!  The $5.95 breakfast was perfect and the staff was super friendly considering the mass of drunken humanity it was dealing with until 3 a.m.  Great job, Steve's!",

They had a cool acoustic guitar player out front so we thought we'd give it a try on Saturday afternoon.   We were sat promptly and got drinks pretty quick too. 3 of us had cheeseburgers of various kinds and the burgers were all so big nobody could finish them! But boy were they delish! Seasoned nicely and just perfectly done. The fries were shoestring kind and they were crispy and well seasoned with a blend of tastes as well; not just salt which made them super yum.  One of us got the crab cake appetizer as a meal and it was just the right kid size serving for kids who like \"crabby patties\". The crab cakes were pretty good though. What was amazingly good are their onion rings. These had just a kick of spicyness to them with a kicky ranch dip. They were remarkably good and I will return to Steve's if not for anything else than the onion rings.  The service was hit and miss. Our server tended to forget about us once the appetizers were served and drinks went empty for longer than I prefer. But the food was good enough that I will come back again next time I'm downtown.   FINALLY someplace that is half-way decent, fairly priced, and IS NOT the HRC.",

The bison burger was again a freezer bound burger, but took enough time to cook it , that it seemed as though they slit the animals throat themselves.  The fish tacos lacked zest.

What did it taste like?  You already know what I am going to say.  It tastes like chicken!  It really does!  Prepared very well (served as ground meat) -  juicy with tomato slices and plenty of diced onion.     The coleslaw that came with the ostrich burger was okay, but lacked pizzaz.  The second first was Citronage orange liquor.  Normally, I have a splash of Cointreau in my martini, but Steve's didn't have Cointreau.   At first I thought I would just use Triple Sec as my splash.    But our waitress kept saying, you gotta try the Citronage.  So we finally gave in.  Really distinctive and pleasant flavor.  It's definitely orange but also has a smoky flavor, reminiscent of a good anejo tequila.      The third first was our waitress, Teigh.  She was fun, and as refereshingly frank,  a server as I have ever had.   After I told her how much I liked the Citronage, she meant it all in good humor when she said \"You bitches were just ganging up on me about insisting on the Triple Sec.  I was trying to tell you about the Citronage!\"  It was nice to get a hot meal after 11:00 at night too.  Oh, and love the huge 44 oz glasses of ice water that you automatically get with your meal.",

The three stars is pretty right on for the food. Our issue with this place was the our waitress, who was overly fake friendly and borderline rude. My husband asked for mayo for his burger which he still had half left, she brought the mayo, along with our dessert (there was not a choice of desserts with the living social deal). She walked by and set them on the table without saying anything. The dessert had ice cream with it, which obviously wasn't going to make it until we were done eating. Also, even though we ordered extra stuff above and beyond the living social deal, she felt the need to remind us we \"HAVE\" to tip on the total cost of the bill including what we got with the living social deal. Which left us totally speechless and that remark caused her tip to be cut in half. We like to use groupon and living social deals to try places we may not otherwise have known about. This is the first time we have ever made to feel bad for taking advantage of a deal from either of those.   I would have given 3 stars because the food was ok and we enjoyed the atmosphere, but the  staff/service bumps it down to 2 stars.",

I had some chicken fried steak with fries and Kristen G. had \"The Special\", which was fish and chips with a bowl of New England clam chowder. Everything was A-OK. Some things were a little salty, some things were just right, some too bland... I'm telling you, if you took a Cracker Barrel, cut the budget by three quarters, and told the manager to attempt to please every kind of patron that would be walking around this area of Phoenix, you would get Steve's Greenhouse Grill.",
