I asked about the size of their chicken wings..the guy taking my order said \"the size of chicken wings\"- I'll pass on the side of smart a$$ thanks. Just a bad attitude.  But, on to the food. My mouth was sexy for some good ole BBQ!! I ended up giving my dry chicken and fries to the homeless lady outside..along with their soupy/kraft macaroni mac-n-cheese. But, the cornbread was decent. Mehh! Won't go back.",

When we placed our order I was happy to see that they had all of their meats in stock (the first time we came they were sold out of nearly everything so we left and decided to try another day- this was our re-do) We ordered the rib tip special with corn and the tri tip with fries plus a soda and a beer- the total came out to $45 which seemed a little bit on the high side for what we had ordered.  The food was fresh and hot when we got it and smelled great. The good- the fries and corn were extremely tasty. The less good- both the rib tips and brisket seemed kind of dry and flavorless.   The True test for me is whether or not I am excited to eat my leftovers the next day for lunch and I hate to say it but I have already made other lunch plans because I have no interest in re-visiting last night's leftovers today.  I hope to come back and have a better experience. I will update my review if I do.",

Right from the moment we walked in the place we were greeted with friendly staff and smiling faces :) Every single person there was so kind and funny and made us feel at home. I had the chicken sandwich with green chili Mac and cheese and a side of fries and cornbread and my wife had the ribs with mashed potatoes and beans and everything was cooked to perfection! We live in San Diego so sadly we can't come here often but we'll make it a point to always stop by when we're in town for the good food and the great people that work here!",

The place was clean and the service was fast and friendly. The prices were fair and the portions generous. Even the bathrooms were nice. The food itself wasn't the best meat I've ever had, but it was still some good quality BBQ. They have their three BBQ sauces out for easy access, so you can decide how much you want of each. All three were pretty good and worth trying.  Overall, I'm not going to say this is the best BBQ joint in the valley, but I will say it's worth a try. You want good BBQ without the long lines and less than ideal seating options? Try this place out!",

I tried the Gumbo, and can honestly say that it is one of the best gumbos I have had, ever. I have traveled a bit and had my share, but this one is off the chart. Lastly, I had the two entree combo, with brisket and pulled pork. Epic.   Well done Frasher. Welcome to the 'hood.",

    "text": "So as a BBQ enthusiast, and having just got back from Kansas City literally 12 hours ago, I was excited to try this place having just had some of the best BBQ in the country.  I quickly realized these guys share my definition of BBQ.    I'm not going to comment on the services as I got there a little early so the rush crowd wasn't in, this is a new restaurant and at this point the service is expected to be working out the kinks, and unless the service was either spit in your food terrible, or give them a plaque great it's really pointless to me since its a thankless job anyway.  Having said that they all were working their butts off and was great to be around.  Right as I walked in I was filled with the wonderful aroma of smoldering wood chips giving my future meal the love it deserves.  The place looked rustic with a modern appeal.  The menu had all the great's when it comes to barbecue.  I was absolutely amazed that they had burnt ends!!  My first time having them was in KC 2 days ago and I fell in love.  They had to be mine.  I ordered the baby back ribs and the burnt ends as any lover would do.  I ordered the Mac and cheese also but I as more concerned about the meat.  Right away I noticed the great pink smoke ring on the meat meaning they took their time in the smoker, vs an oven which I appreciate.  Both of them were very tender and filled with the wonderful smoke, and meat flavor that would make a vegetarian blush.  The reviewer before me said that the family is from St. Louis so I was surprised that the burnt ends were chopped up so small.  In KC they are in much larger chunks, but maybe they do it differently in St. Louis.  Still very good though.    I didn't get a chance to talk with the owner but I did see him walking around talking with the customers, and he seemed like a very nice man.  The midwesterner in me appreciates that.  Some reviewers before me had some complaints about some pretty petty stuff like the tip line on the receipt when ordering from the till.  Get over it.  The only real complaints I have is that the parking lot wasn't very efficient making it difficult to enter and leave.  Coming from an engineering and construction background I notice these things but no big deal.  I also noticed that they need to have misters installed on the patio which can be fixed.  All pretty minor when it comes to the real reason why I came here.  Deliciously smoked meat.  I'm definitely coming here again.",

My bro tried the mac and cheese and said it was as good as the Original spot. No fried Raviolis or late night drinking here, but I actually like this spot better then the old digs on Scottsdale rd.

Last night we were able to (finally!) take advantage of their \"first Friday of the month\" St. Louis style pizza.  The Frasher's have family roots in St. Louis and offer pizza and toasted ravioli from their family recipes. What exactly IS St. Louis style pizza?  Thin, cracker crust, with a unique local cheese (dare I say, addictive?), and cut into squares vs. wedges.   We got the 16 in. pie with sausage and the toasted ravioli with homemade tomato sauce.  Both were EXCELLENT!  Hot, crispy. The ravioli were stuffed with hamburger.  We took ours home and re-heated the pizza at our leisure -- because it is so thin, it crisps up in a hot oven in 3-4 minutes.  Delicious. And -- the staff at Frashers told us that now we don't have to wait a whole month before our next pizza fix ... Starting in mid-March, the St. Louis pizza will become a regular item on Frasher's menu.  Good news for all you pizza lovers out there.",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time this week. Needed a break from the usual Biltmore corridor fare. Someone threw out the idea of bbq and this was closest.   Large place, lots of seating at booths or tables (seat yourself) clean, dark and casual. Sparsely decorated with no real theme or atmosphere and a couple of TVs playing quietly. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Meats come un-sauced and they have three or four different sauces at a central counter you help yourself to. Crowd was sparse and a mix of suits and uniforms  service was friendly and competent and they explained how to order since it was our first time.   My lunch mate had the pulled pork sandwich which is simply meat in a bun and a side of green chili Mac and cheese.   I had a two meat combo with brisket and tri-tip and the Mac on the side and ordered a slice of the gooey butter cake for us to share. Combo comes with Texas toast.   Pulled pork was excellent, smoky and well cooked. The brisket and tri-tip were ok, not horrible, not memorable and all my food, including the toast, was room temperature and dry. Mac and cheese are individual (not suitable for sharing as an FYI) a la carte portions and was tasty and heated through. Drinks are also self service and the ice tea was fresh and it appears they have beer, wine and cocktails. My lunchmate noted that the choices are \"white\" and \"red\" and are $9 a glass, cocktails are $7 and beers are $5, going on memory.   Combined this very simple meal was about $35.00+ and frankly for that much was not comparable to what you'd get for the same money at many other places in the area, for instance at OSHO a short distance away that serves really great hit and juicy pulled pork, brisket and pastrami sandwiches with good sides in a slightly nicer environment, or for that matter Hillstones at the Biltmore, where we could have eaten for a comparable cost.",

We ordered the 3 meat combo and had pulled pork and brisket x 2.  Both meats were wonderful and the homemade sauces are amazing.  Both my boyfriend and I say the Spicy wins but the others are really good as well.  Tennessee Tangy and Sweet and then some tangy mustard that we did not try.  There are plenty of sides to choose from, dessert (gooey butter cake - sounds amazing) and a kids menu.  One thing I noticed while we ate was that the staff was always moving and busy.  All three FOH girls were productive the entire time whether they were checking on customers, refilling sauce containers, bussing tables, general cleaning up and restocking, etc.  I was very impressed.  Overall, a fantastic experience and we will be sure to give more of the menu a try next time!",

The staff is incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable of their menu and (who I assumed to be) the owner's son had the most charismatic smile that oozed charm. The bar tender was very upbeat and friendly. The patio seating is comfortable and the interior casual with booths and tables to choose from.  Now, let's get serious for a minute. The pulled pork was wonderful; and as a Southern woman, I take my BBQ seriously; it was prepared and seasoned PERFECTLY. The butter cake, y'all. It is life changing. Eat. Frasher's.

But the other meats we got were pretty good.  The set up is okay but they don't need to let you know you need to order drinks as well as alcohol when you order your food.  Also when they bring your food they should tell you, you need to get your own utensils.  Price is okay, hopefully as they are opened longer and if they listen to their reviewers it will only get better.  I think they set their own bars high by handing up all their rewards from Frasher's Steakhouse.  Good Luck guys I'll be back.",

For $8 however, I would have expected a side to be included. My husband had the brisket which was also good but not exceptional. The fries were thick and generous but undercooked. I also tried the green chili mac which was tasty. The assortment of sauces was good too, but not exceptional.  The place was quiet at 6:30 on a friday and the service was fast.  My issues with this place started with the price point. For a smokehouse that serves on plasticware , they are a little too proud of the food. my husband and I can get full on brisket AND a cocktail apiece for the same $40 at Grassroots.   The second issue I have is the plasticware. Plates and forks as well as styrofoam clamshells for the taking as needed, I cannot fathom the waste. Again, for the price point, please let's have silverware instead of piles and piles of plastic in our landfills. I'm sure it's cheaper than paying for a dishwasher and the staff to bus and clear, but if we went back, I would bring a fork from home.",

We were there at an odd hour - around 3:30, so there was just us and some people who popped in around 4. We talked with the manager (maybe owner??) who was very helpful and guided us through the menu options.   I decided on the rips, corn and coleslaw and my husband got the pulled pork, broccoli and jalapeno mac and cheese.   OMG! The food was AMAZING!! I got the 6 rib plate which was way to much for me, so thankfully we had leftovers. You can tell the care that they put into smoking and preparing the meat. It was so delicious, falling off the rips and the cuts were rather lean for ribs. There was a lot of meat on there!  The BBQ sauces they had are house-made and spectacular. I love that they are home-made and don't have MSG or high-fructose corn syrup. The variety of flavors was great too.   One thing I highly recommend getting is the corn. I don't know exactly how they make it, but it was delicious. The cole-slaw isn't loaded with mayonnaise so we all enjoyed it.   This is definitely our new favorite BBQ place. The service and food were both worthy of 5 stars!",

Now to the sides...green chili Mac and cheese was bland and very watery soup like; beans looked great but very identifiable to canned Hormel chili; the corn was canned with some salt and pepper added; mashed potatoes were okay but instant; corn bread good and gooey cake was good.  We were there from 1100 to 1230 and the place was empty on a weekday. Not a good sign I guess the locals know what to expect.

    "text": "Went for lunch today in search of burnt ends. There were only enough ends for one platter so I opted for the brisket platter. We ordered the green chili Mac cheese, the garlic mashed potatoes , french fries, and cornbread as our sides. The buttery cornbread on their dessert menu was very tasty. The watery mac and cheese was plain with faint hints of green chili. The mash potatoes tasted like instants with no hint of garlic. But what I came for were the burnt ends. If you have had ends from jalapeno bucks or Lucille's these don't keep up with expectations. Fatty cuts of over cooked meat were disappointing. The brisket was fair but I got no hints of good wood smoke. The bbq sauces were awful and need to be reformulated. My draft lagunitas ipa was flat and the experience overall was a learning moment for $50",

They gave a great military discount but prices were affordable too. The ribs and brisket were tender and flavorful. They had delicious sides too mac n cheese has corn in it which I never had but trust me it was wonderful! The corn and beans were great too! They put their own spin on every fish and did it well. We will be back and will recommend it for sure.",

Eating those burnt ends and jalapenos, on their front patio, was spot-on. The fresh corn and green chile mac & cheese were packed with flavor. But our highlight was meeting George, the owner, as he showed us the smoker and how it worked, right behind us. Last but NOT least, their Gooey Butter Cake was UNREAL. I travel quite a bit and don't drink alcohol, so I'm always seeking out another drug: sugar. The cake was UNIQUE and caused me to laugh, that's how good it is. Get it and like and thank them for the experience. MONEY.",

    "text": "Going down the list of best BBQ's in Phoenix and ruling them out: 1. Little Miss...closes early, too long of a wait 2. Bobby Q's...been there too many times 3. Texas BBQ House...closes at 7pm 4. Frasher's...never heard of it, stumbled across it for first time on Yelp, decided to give it a go.  Best Friday night dining decisions in a long time! Service was excellent as in other reviews, baby backs were top notch, meaty, fresh, perfectly seasoned.  I asked about the mac and cheese and was given an honest answer about it being your standard boxed mac and cheese spiced up so I passed, why set myself up?  I had the turkey gumbo and it was such a nice alternative to your standard gumbo with too much fish and sausage for my taste, had a great kick that was offset by white rice to soothe the spiciness.  Hubs had the tri-tip and liked it a lot, he liked the slaw and beans as well.  I am a sugar addict so I took a slice of  gooey butter cake to go and added a scoop of vanilla ice cream and lounged with it- never had butter cake, would eat it every day now if i could, so good, really, really good.    Loved the barrels sinks in washrooms and the space is quite inviting. We are in north Phoenix so the drive was not the most convenient but definitely worth it!",

We were greeted right away by who I'm assuming is the GM or owner, he was great & went over the menu with us. You could tell how enthusiastic he was about the BBQ, he offered to get us samples of anything on the menu & gave us complimentary soft drink cups as it was our first time. I had the 3 meat combo with ribs/turkey/brisket and garlic mash and green chili Mac as the sides. The ribs were my least favorite (still good) but I prefer my ribs with more of a bite to them, these were a little too tender. The brisket was flavorful & juicy, turkey was the winner as it had the delicious smokey flavor while still being tender. I didn't care for the sides, the garlic mash was good but it just didn't seem to pair well with the smokey meats. The Mac was a little soggy but my husband enjoyed it. We will definitely be back as the food was wonderful, priced well for BBQ and the service was top notch!",

The beef brisket, if that's what you want to call it, tasted like one of those microwave barbecue meats that you buy at the grocery store in those black plastic microwave trays, there was not a drop of a seasoning on the so called brisket, not any smoked taste, it was as tough as shoe leather, and it actually looked like it was boiled, if that is possible, the fries were those huge steak fries that were clearly frozen, the corn was nothing more than canned corn that they doctored, the so called \"Texas toast\" that they gave with the meal was the consistency of mush, the ribs had zero taste, and the barbecue sauce was doctored K.C. Masterpiece.  And $40.00 later!!!Steer clear!!!",

Sad to say the new concept just didn't appeal to me.   Overall my sense was meh. It was not the best, not the worst but meh. Could give the benefit of doubt that maybe I just ordered the wrong things (always a possibility). Wife and I had Burnt ends (which are usually yummy), tri-tip platter side of the corn. Burnt ends which are an item we would usually really enjoy just seemed bland. No real flavor to it apart from the overall smokeyness of the meat. Trip top was about the same, almost seemed like all the juice had been sucked out and both items were just a bit dried out.   This place is right in the neighborhood so I am sure we will be back at some point. Hopefully it will end with a better experience.",

    "text": "I am one that really enjoys a good BBQ, and I found it here. Though this is a little drive for us, it was recommended and we took the trip. It was well worth it! We were there for lunch on Sunday and I had the competition style ribs (available Sundays only). The meat was falling off the bone. The flavor was excellent. I am one that likes to use a lot of BBQ sauce, but not on these ribs! I ate these without the sauce as the taste was Phenomenal. My wife had the 2 meat plate with pulled pork and tri-tip, both were very good as I, of course, had to try them both! Our friends had the baby back ribs and told us they will definitely be going back as they live much closer than we do.  I do have one suggestion for the management, maybe consider putting in fans or ceiling fans on the patio as it was a beautiful day out and we did sit there, but the fly's were getting a little annoying. Fans will help to keep them away.  For anyone that enjoys a good barbeque and do not want to pay very high prices, this is the place to try,",

    "text": "Well...came here when the place I was going to eat at was closed for renovations. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, fries and the Mac n cheese side. Went to sit down and wait for my food at a dirty table. It also had an empty roll of paper towels. I wiped the table myself with the last scrap of paper hanging on the roll and waited. Food came quickly minus the French fries as they said they were on the way. I lifted the bun and asked the girl where the BBQ sauce was after I didn't see anything on the table. She told me it was up in the front. So I walked from the back of the restaurant to the front by the entrance to a table lined up with to go boxes, plastic silverware and BBQ sauce squirt bottles. They are marked with a sharpie which flavor they contain. I filled my little plastic cups and headed back to the table. Felt very cafeteria!   My sandwich was good and the fries once they arrived were also good. The macaroni cheese is terrible. Mushy and tastes artificial. Don't bother for 3 bucks you get a small side and it tastes bad. All food served in styrofoam, plastic and cardboard. Plastic knives and forks too!  Overall it was okay. The decor was a good attempt but the overall feel is very cafeteria which is emphasized by the lack of real plates and silverware. A long rectangular room with a bunch of booths lined up against the wall. Very dark inside due to the Edison bulbs used in the fixtures. Cool looking but not practical.   Not sure I will come back. Meh....",

Also the place looks great!...great old Americana mural on the wall, and a nice open retro feel throughout.  Can't wait till the bar scene kicks in and we can stay later over some specialty cocktails!  Right now they are so kicking they close when the food sells out!!  That's fresh daily made.food and attest to the quality...maybe another smoker is on the horizon cuz we want more!!!!",

The menu is also lacking most of the favorite Midwest food items the former restaurant had (now I have nowhere but St Louis to go to eat Imo's or toasted ravs!) I ordered a small portion of average brisket and a side for around $20  I don't think I'll be returning.. Too much competition in this neighborhood to deal with minimal options, a pricey menu married with a super casual, dark environment. Giving two stars for the attentive customer service, but I can't say I prefer the food, menu or restaurant atmosphere.",

Pleasant enough surrounding for BBQ with ordering from a knowledgeable young girl and delivery to your table.  The owner does circulate, which is a nice touch.  Based on previous Reviews I tried the \"Burnt Ends\" and they had good (NOT excellent) flavor. I thought the portion was small and their \"sides\" are ridiculously small and priced much too high, which seems to be the \"norm\" for BBQ Restaurants. All in all NOT a bargain and for the price would expect significantly better.   All in all will NOT try again, unless he starts serving the same Prime Rib he did at his long standing location on Scottsdale Road.",

It picks up in the evening and weekend but for now they close at 8 so come for dinner or take out. Take out is less than 10 min and all smoke did is made fresh reach day! So come hungry Cuz anything you order is unique and amazing. Sauce is crazy tasty, the staff is fun and once again the food is so bomb!!!",

The star of my order was the butter cake. Oh boy--it was still warm when I finally got to it and was AWESOME.  I must say that the service stands out to me as well--the gentleman who took our order was very kind and helpful. He checked on us during our meal as well. Another thing I want to mention is how they responded to a man who came in (who I presume was homeless based on the conversation he had with my husband). My husband responds by buying dinner for him, and the staff went out of their way to be accommodating. That warmed my heart and I think speaks volumes for the character of the place.  Finally, we had the opportunity to meet the owner on our way out. Friendly gentleman who was very engaging and welcoming. He also mentioned that he was about to open a \"Nashville Hot Chicken\" place near there so I encourage Phoenix residents to get over there and try it!  I'm sure it will be great as well!  They deserve your support!!",

    "text": "Well, I don't know about 5/5 as compared to some other places I've been, but I'll say 4.5/5.  I finally cleaned the 4000 restaurant receipts out of my purse so I'd remember to write reviews, and got to Frasher's.  My husband and I were here back in late July and came prepared to take leftovers home because we wanted to try a lot of food.  Here is what we ordered:  3 meat plate ($17) which comes with 2 sides.  We ordered the fries and baked beans.  We also ordered a side of green chile mac & cheese, some cornbread, and a half doz of the smoked wings, naked.  For our meats we tried the brisket, chicken, and baby back ribs.  Everything was 5/5 except for the chicken.  It was pretty dry and I probably would not order that again.  Do I really need to go into details?  Just look at the pictures.  The baked beans were seasoned very nicely and had chunks of smoked meat in them.  Very nice to dip that dry chicken in.  The baby backs were our favorite out of the 3 meats and we didn't have any of those leftover to take home, I can assure you.  The wings had a nice smoky flavor and were surprisingly moist, but the drummies had a fair amount of gristle.  Just kind of a turnoff to what would otherwise be perfect wings.    The cornbread.  Dude, the cornbread.  It's listed separately under desserts and if you order it you will see why.  Totally decadent and we had a couple of bites and took the rest home.  I proceeded to savor the rest all by myself the next day.  Delicious.    And how could I forget the green chile mac & cheese?  Fantastic!  We had a great meal and took 2 togo containers home with us as well.  All that food and a beer came out to $37.47.  Not bad at all.  The staff were friendly and helpful as well, when we told them it was our first visit.  Is it the best BBQ I've ever had?   No, but it's in my top 10.  Looking forward to going back and getting a full order of those ribs, some cornbread, and some mac & cheese.  I don't know what you'll be having, but that's my dinner!",

And they let me sample their Gumbo.  Everything was on Point  Can't wait to come back and owner hinted about doing some St Louis style Pizza.  Yum.",

We were greeted immediately by a super nice guy (I'm sorry I forgot his name, my bad) and informed of all of the choices we had as far as dinners. And there were quite a few combos we could try. We let him know that we won this dinner and his mood never diminished. He even made some other suggestions so we could get a taste of everything they had to offer. My husband had the turkey jambalaya and said it was extremely tasty and a meal in itself. We both had a meat combo, mine with turkey and chicken his with ribs and tri-tip.  Wow! There was a lot of food and we had some to take home. The corn bread, OMG! Delicious! Buttery as all get out and good ,good ,good! They have great food and tasty sauces and sides. The food was darn good at a 4 and 1/2 stars, but the service kicked it up to at least 5 stars. We will be back with friends to share next time! Thanks again for a really nice experience. :0)",

    "text": "I can't tell you how many times I have sat at the Vegan restaurant across the street from Frasher's, looking out the window; and hearing the BBQ sirens calling out my name!  \"Why eat vegetables, when you can feast on delicious Smoked BBQ Flavored meat!\" The sirens incessantly called out.  I'm not a practicing vegan, but I do enjoy a well prepared Vegan Meal. However, I have no compunction of consuming meat, as well.   I had managed to resist all that time, until one day, my daughter invited us to dinner.  When I suggested to her that we go to the Vegan restaurant, she proffered the alternative across the street - Frasher's!  That's all the urging that I needed. Whatever reservations I had about eating at this place didn't just go out the window. It was literally heaved out the window!  As we walked in, the aroma of such delicious BBQ flavored meats wafting from the kitchen and enveloping the place was simply too much to stand. It didn't help at all that I hadn't eaten dinner from the previous evening. And then I summarily skipped breakfast and lunch, as well.  My beloved wife and daughter wanted to examine the menu; whereas I knew exactly what I wanted.   I had the 2 meat combo (Pulled Pork and Brisket) with all the trimmings (Baked Beans, Fries, Corn Bread, and Garlic Mashed Potatoes). I realize that the meal comes with two sides, but that would not suffice this evening.  Honestly, I forgot what my family ordered, until I looked at the pictures of their food choices, as I write this review. I was absolutely fixated on how my order was going to turn out, and the subsequent enjoyment that I would derive from it.  So, much for loving husband and father! LOL  I digress.   They had the pulled pork and the brisket, individually; with all the trimmings. Our overall impressions were that each of our dinner selections were a definite home run!  The meats were well prepared, seasoned, and had the proper textures. Not too soggy, and not too dry. The staff were both cheerful, and enthusiastic. Definitely quite passionate about their product, and truly interested and concerned about each customer's impression; as we had observed during our time there.  The sirens that beckoned us to this place positively and absolutely did not lead to a shipwreck. On the contrary, they led us to a wonderful dining establishment that we so truly enjoyed!",

The pulled pork looks and tastes great.  It is not the overcooked mush you get at some so called BBQ places.  The smoked turkey is moist, tender and just the right amount of smoke.  The beans are good and the coleslaw is exceptionally done.  It is crisp and well flavored.  The chicken was a bit dry and not much smoke flavor.  It didn't seem to match the rest of the food.  As a strictly personal preference it would have been nice to have pulled chicken and/or maybe the ability to have a hot link along with the meal.  I look forward to returning to try the ribs and some of the other sides.  The turkey gumbo also looked interesting.",

The outside has a big patio and the interior is spacious and nicely decorated.The bathrooms were clean and there is even a Frank Zappa Poster hanging up in the hallway.    Travis and the bartender took fantastic care or us.Everyone was warm and friendly including the cooks waiving from the back.  it looks like they are more than happy to work there.  I have been all over the country and had many different BBQ and this one of the best.  Whats nice is they provide you with sauce on the side in squeezable bottle letting you choose.  I love this.  This way it allows you to taste the smoked  flavor of the meat. I tried the Brisket, pulled pork and the burnt end.  All outstanding, I am always partial to pulled port.  The sauces they had I tried and really likes the hot one.  just enough spice for my pallet. My sides were the Baked Beans,the coleslaw Garlic Mashed and the Green Chile Mac n Cheese.  Loved them all  really the black beans could be a meal on their own, the mashed melts in your mouth and the mac has just enough chili to let you know its there. The slaw was just the way I like it non goo  not runny just refreshing and thick. I have to try the Gooey Butter cake.  I was like its made of what.... Well it was outstanding a real treat.  I don't eat desert ever but this was very special and different so give it a rip.     I wish these folks well. The staff speaks highly about the owner and the care he put into his recipes.  The whole place runs like a top notch restaurant very pleased I will be back, with friends and family.",

The turkey was amazing and one may not think of turkey as a great choice for BBQ, but it's some of the best that I've had. The ribs - so tender and served dry so you can pick one of the great sauces to compliment them. Speaking of the sauces - homemade and fantastic - try them all. Sides - green chili Mac and cheese, great baked beans and mashed potatoes served with some of the best Texas toast.   You can't beat the flavor of that smoked meat and to finish it off - a St. Louis staple, the gooey butter cake, the best west of the 'Lou.......  What sets any Frasher's endeavor apart from the rest (beside the great food) is the people that he employs, friendly, honest and committed to making the experience a great one for the customer.... His latest concept is smart and economical and perfect for anyone's BBQ fix.",

I ordered the two-pound plate with 10 bones with the sole intent of having some bones to take home for tomorrow night's supper.   Other stellar servings and moments: -- Friendly, courteous staff members. And when you tell them thank you they don't say \"No problem.\"  Instead the proper \"You're welcome.\" or its equivalent. -- The veggies served with the wings were killer. Fresh. Crisp.  Crunchy. And cold as ice. I ordered extra carrots; I couldn't stop eating them.  -- The Ranch dressing served with the wings was better than any I've ever tasted. Honest to Pete. Creamy. Perfectly seasoned. Damn near drinkable! -- Green Chili Mac was killer diller. -- Baked beans were near chili-like. A bowl of 'em and a  slip of Saltines would be good on a cold, Winter night.  -- The Texas toast was delicious and buttery.  Toasted on the griddle jus' like this Texas boy is used to.  The bread had the same \"tooth\" as potato bread, however the bread's packaging referenced not a spud. I could've eaten a whole loaf but I didn't wanna push my luck having ordered extra carrots.   -- House music is good ol' blues and mellow rock at precisely the right volume.  If I wasn't driving I'd dive into one of the bar's bottles of tequila.  -- George, the owner, is a cutiepatootie Teddy bear.   Now, if the joint added apricot fried pies to the dessert menu, thus ol' Texas boy would be forever grateful. Otherwise, the joint's a winner.  Check it out or miss out.",

Driest meat ever, should of known when i saw King Size BBQ sauce available.  Had to drown the meat in it to get it down.   I am from the home of the Tri Tip BBQ, Santa Maria, CA.  If this placed served me the first Tri Tip in my life it would have been the last.  That dry.  Smokehouse is misleading, I believe its a pit hickory bbq, cause smoked meat is very tender, this meat was cooked too fast and way overdone.

The rest of the meats that I tried (chicken, brisket and ribs) all taste like they were slow roasted in the oven.  For the ribs, they were still tender and juicy, but I missed that smoky taste. Costumer service is excellent though. Just wish the meat was better.  TRY: the Turkey and the green chili mac and cheese AVOID: Cornbread (dry), brisket (tough and flavorless)",

We got the 2 meat combo with burnt ends and brisket with the corn and mac. All the meats were super tender and the price was unbeatable @$15 (especially coming from LA).  Unfortunately I did find a hair in my corn, which would normally cause me to give a 1-star, but the food and service more than made up for it. The worker offered us free pork ribs to try even before I found the hair, AND gave us a complimentary gooey butter cake for the hair mishap. Would definitely come again...

As a St Louis transplant, I am super fond of the St Louis style pizza, think IMO's.  Thin crust with Provel cheese! Oh, that cheese!  The toasted ravioli are equal to what I eat when in the Lou. And of course I must get the token gooey butter cake to round out the meal of my dreams.   Tonight when it was discovered that our order had inadvertently been given to the wrong customer, the staff bent over backwards to get our order out pronto, but they also gave us a few extra goodies at no charge.  I have worked food service and I understand how this sort of thing can occur. No big deal. But, the manner in which it was handled was such a pleasant surprise.  Kudos to everyone working tonight!    My husband is of the gluten free variety so he always orders the BBQ. The ribs tonight were especially meaty and very moist. Next time there we want to try the turkey everyone raves about.   Be sure to visit the First Friday of every month for the pizza, ravioli and gooey butter cake. It is limited, but worth the 29 day wait each month.   I understand why you have lasted nearly 18 years in the BBQ business. Keep up the great work!",

Another AZ BBQ experience in which we realized we are no longer in Tennessee anymore.  Meat was okay.. not the best, but certainly not the worse we've had. The sides though. God bless those sides...  I ordered the turkey sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. The mac n cheese tasted fine, but it was extremely runny and soupy. No thickness to it at all.  My poor fiance ordered their mashed potatoes as a side to the three meat platter. When the plate came out, we thought the mashed potatoes were grits (see attached photo). In addition to their watered down appearance, they were pretty bland and ended up forming a solid mass by the end of our lunch -  we were a bit disappointed. The bbq sauce was okay, but tasted like it came out of a huge tub.  My recommendations:  In addition to improving the side items, I would highly recommend sweet tea be served, an absolute staple paired with BBQ. We were baffled as to why they were serving some sort of tropical kiwi/watermelon tea by the soda machine at a bbq place.",

Staff was friendly and it wasn't busy, yet it still took about 12 minutes for my sandwich.       Although it said that meats are smoked daily, I am absolutely certain this was yesterday's beef.  It was dry and chewy, likely reheated.  I eat BBQ almost weekly and I'm used to brisket being served medium at most with a nice fat layer and a pink smoke ring...not the case here.

Service was excellent the cashier was accommodating to my brisket sandwich order and the wait was no more than 10 mins.   Food - I am a bit of a connoisseur of BBQ having competed back in Texas for a couple of years and our team has even placed in some (credentials). The brisket flavor was mild in smoke and lean. Due to the leanness the brisket was a little on the dry side and it appeared they were using be brisket flat which yields leaner cuts. My failure was not asking for marbled cuts since I was in a bit of a rush, not sure if they have that. I am not knocking this some people like it dryer, I just like my cuts from the point with more natural juices. Back to the flavor it being mild in smoke didn't make it so rich and overwhelming as some. The sandwich paired with their spicy sauce made for an excellent lunch. I like my sandwiches with onions and pickles which is a Texas staple. The coleslaw was standard nothing outstanding but still good. The sauce is more of a Memphis/KC style sauce but it was good.   I would go again to try other items and go with a little more time.",

Do we seat ourselves? Do we order now or when we sit? She didn't even point us to the self serve soda machine. Our food came very quick maybe less than 10 min. It was not as great as we had hoped. It didn't even look like authentic bbq it looked like it was all just taken out of the microwave and thrown on the plate. Not an ounce of fat or burned pieces it didn't even look like BBQ! The sauces were good. The side I had was Mac and cheese it was horrible and not even creamy it was runny and gross. Maybe it's different BC it's St Louis style and not Texas style buttt I don't think we will be back here. Horrible service bad attitudes and mediocre food.

My food was phenomenal, the burnt ends were so perfect. Awesome flavor from the smoke and perfect crunch from the bark. Easily the best I've ever had. I had a bite of my friend's tri tip which was so tender and tasty. As for sides, my friend swore by the green Chile Mac n cheese. But overall, very warm and inviting environment and seriously great bbq. The owner came and checked on us a few times and was so nice! He even brought over this great butter cake for us to try which was so great, if I wasn't so stuff I would have ordered another! But I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's visiting the Phoenix area and is looking for a delicious meal or somewhere relaxing to have a few beers and watch a game. 10/10 would repeat!",

Everything seems so right about Frasier's, great menu great location and very friendly staff.  I ordered three-meat combo which was three bones of baby back ribs, burnt ends and pulled pork. My side items were French fries and green chili macaroni and cheese. I also ordered a cup of turkey gumbo.  The combo meal: The meal was fine, but it was not great. I would say the best selection out of the 3 meat combo was the baby back ribs. The ribs were moist had decent smoke and had good flavor.  The burnt ends where not moist and very tough and chewy. It's always a delight to see someone outside of Missouri making burnt ends but when you are from Kansas City you are going to be hard when it comes to burnt ends because you know what right taste like and looks like.  The turkey gumbo: this was honestly my favorite dish out of everything I had. Very good roux it had turkey sausage which gave it an abundance of flavor.  grades: Turkey gumbo- 9 ribs-7.5 burnt ends- 5.5 pulled pork-5  Maybe they had a bad day and they look like they know what they're doing so don't let my review scare you off still go by and give them a try. I eat a lot of barbecue all over the country so I'm going to be a pretty tough critic",

All the meat was moist and excellent, except the ribs could have been better, had some dry spots and was firmly attached to the bone. The sides here leave something to be desired. No green beans or collards, no vegetables as sides or you can pay extra to do a side salad. Baked beans were a bit spicy and the mashed potatoes while they tasted good, looked a lot like they came out of the freezer.",

They even have large coloring books and \"the good crayons\" as my niece would say to keep the kids entertained. The food was delicious and came out quickly despite our large group size.

Next when your pastrami cannot be chewed and contains huge chunks of fat, that is your second issue. It was brisket that they charged two dollars more for and called it Pastrami. This was just totally disgusting. I don't think this is a real bbq place...it is some fancy chef opening his third of fourth restaurant and being totally clueless on how to barbeque. As a matter of fact, the owner cared more about greeting customers than caring about the quality of that crap coming out of his kitchen. All I see in the back is two Mexican guys cooking...has there ever been a great bbq joint without a real bbq guy in the back? Since my last visit, prices up two bucks on each item. All I know is definitely don't order the Monday Pastrami!!",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday brunch time. Definitely not busy cuz they just opened about 30 minutes ago. Parking lot is good. nice family / cozy/ Mississippi feeling atmosphere on the inside. Good music. Good ambience.  Order a brisket sandwich with one side of corn and also a half pound of baby back ribs with 2 sides. For the two sides I had the potato and mac and cheese.  With regards to the size, and the corn was okay. I would pass on the mashed potato. Mac and cheese would be a better choice for a side.  With regards to the brisket, still juicy, not dried, flavor really depends on the sauce that they have on the side for you to get on your own.  With regards to the ribs, definitely way more meat than other places, juicy, some fatty parts, flavor also depends on the sauce as well, but eating it by itself is still good.  With regards to the sauce, I preferred the Tennessee sauce. The spicy BBQ sauce isn't really that spicy, but would be my second go to Sauce. The sweet sauce was very Bland and lacked flavor. I did not try the tangy sauce which was the last sauce there.  Overall, Tennessee sauce is my favorite.  Also with the rib plate you get 2 side of Toast.   Pricing wasn't too bad. The brisket sandwich cost around $10 I believe. Plus tax. $14 plus tax for the rib plate, half pound ribs.  Quick-service especially if you go when I did in the morning right after they open.  They also have daily specials, such as pastrami Mondays, Texas Tuesday, check the calendar on the outside for the daily specials.",

Order at the counter as you come in, grab a drink and find a seat. They will bring your order to your table.  The staff is very helpful with suggestions.  We decided on a 3 meat platter including Burnt Ends, Pulled Pork, and Brisket with Baked Beans and Cornbread.    The portion was huge!  But, let me tell you, there was nothing left at the end of our meal!  So good.  The Burnt Ends were amazing, lovely caramelized bits of goodness.  The Pulled Pork was juicy and so tender as was the Brisket.  Honestly could not pick a favorite out of the bunch.  We tried different sauces (all good), but none of these meats really needed anything extra.  The beans were fantastic with big pieces of bacon throughout, wow!    We just had iced teas, however they do offer a full bar.  There were also watermelon slices available over by the sauces.  Be sure to check out the walls for a great education in all things BBQ. George, the owner, was great.  So friendly, chatting with the guests and even delivering orders to the tables, so nice!   Seems like the area is getting a lot of new places popping up.  Frasher's has been here for quite awhile - because they've been doing it right here for years.    Make sure to check them out, you'll be so glad you did!!  We'll be back next time we're in town.",

Coleslaw was super bland but fresh and crip, bbq bean where ok at best. Lemonade was very good and overall ambiance was nice, very cool outdoor seating area but off Indian School road so a little noisy. Service was very good, fast and friend and that's why 3 stars.

I ordered the Brisket and found it had zero bark as they say they cut it off to make the burnt ends. The Brisket was extremely rubbery, and given that burnt ends weren't available at opening time I highly suspect I was either eating yesterday's Brisket or they don't know how to properly smoke a Brisket. Given the high prices, and the poor meat cook I can't recommend this place. Hopefully they can improve because I really wanted to like the place.",

It is so good, and you cant really go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff is so nice and respectful. I absolutely hate staff who bother you every 5 mins while you're eating. The bbq is worth the drive to us, and we will definitely be back!!!!!!",

    "text": "Went last night for ribs. 1lb of baby back ribs ($24) & 2 medium sides ($12) & 2 medium iced tea...total $44  Not too thrilled with this place. First of all, the ribs are just pork ribs & not baby backs. However they did taste pretty good. The sides are mediocre. The decor is like a self service  joint. Line up to order, pick your table & they will bring the food. Not much table service. My complaints are that it costs way too much for $44 for a rib dinner which doesn't even include sides. I'll have better value & services at other restaurants ( ie Lucille's BBQ ). Probably won't go back again ! Disappointed !",

I like spicy, vinegary sauce, and theirs had very mild kick and slightly sweet and syrupy.  I also ordered a half dozen wings, which I would avoid altogether.  They bread and fry the wings (like you would find at Hooters), and drench them in their sauce.  I ate three and threw the others away... they were that bad.  The interior is cool, and the staff is very friendly and attentive.",

No falling off the bone meat in this place.  After placing our order at the counter our plates came out in 10 seconds flat, meaning it's sitting in the kitchen under warmers until served.  This makes for DRY meat.  Everything was room temp including the mac and cheese and potatoes.  The garlic mashed potatoes had no garlic in them.  The mac and cheese was a soupy, tasteless mess.  The cornbread was good and my husbands fries were hit.  $41 later we were very disappointed.  I sent my entire meal back.  One positive note, George and his staff are very nice people.  If you've been to Joe's real BBQ in Gilbert (where the line to order is often out the front door) then you've had good BBQ.",

    "text": "I live down the block-- saw under construction and for a while was excited, anxiously waiting the arrival of what I was praying would be good local BBQ when suddenly I drove by and found that Frasiers was open! Yay!  Merely 2 days later- my wife and I embarked on the journey which is a meal from which I'm still stuffed to this moment.  We got brisket, chicken and pulled pork- all of which were top notch. Loved the BBQ sauce. The sides were good too, especially the corn and fries (we also tried the Mac and cheese).  While the meat itself and convenience earns this place a well deserved 5 stars, there are significant needs for improvement in this new establishment:  -Mac and cheese: was fair at best, it had the texture and monotonous flavor of a KFC Mac and cheese with some green chilies mixed in. The flavor had little to no depth.  -Toast/bread was boring and generic  -service still has kinks that need to be worked out (a little slow and they had run out of regular napkins and were passing around a large paper towel napkin rolls as a backup)  These flaws in mind- definitely won't stop my next visit. I genuinely enjoyed my meal and look forward to trying turkey, ribs, cole slaw and baked beans next time. So happy to have a new and great BBQ joint so close to home!   Try it!",

    "text": "Average at best. I had to bring a point to the attention of the owner before any action was taken.   Employees look confused.   Ordered tri-tip and brisket. Brisket was a good, soft and moist piece from the flat and had good flavor, but hardly any bark. Maybe 5 minutes over cooked. As for the tri-tip, theirs should be called dry-tip. Obviously cooked at high temp for short time, no rendered fat goodness, just giant chewy chunks and ribbons of fat. Someone needs to turn in their BBQ card cause if you can't do a tri then I have absolutely no respect for you. Tri tip is one of the tastiest on the cow, yet this had zero flavor and zero bark.may as well have been a 3 day old leftover from the fridge that you snack on. Mac n cheese was the best part.  Overall I rank Frashers on a Famous Dave's level of BBQ. Definitely not a place you show up early to or stand on line for. Pricing should be 2 dollars less, mine were 1/4 pound each and were $6 sandwiches, not $8 and $9 respectively. Mac side was $3 and should be $2. So, if you're passing by and it looks empty you may want to try for yourself, but I do not recommend. So there you have it folks.",

I've tried multiple items, but my favorite is the pulled pork, its hands down the best pulled pork I've ever had. The portions are huge, the meat is slow cooked to perfection. The homemade BBQ sauces are amazing I LOVE the sweet and hot, I mix them both to get a custom blend I love. The sides are to die for, the corn is the best corn I've ever had at any restaurant its so buttery and seasoned perfectly. I enjoy the music and the atmosphere every time. I honestly can't say enough good things about this place! Whatever you do save room for the dessert the homemade gooey butter cake is a slice of heaven! I'll be back to visit soon I get cravings for the pulled pork all the time!! Do yourself a favor and stop in for lunch or dinner ASAP!! You'll be glad you did!!",

    "text": "Went there for my first time with my roommate and a buddy with his girlfriend.  When I got my ribs, I was expecting them to near fall off the bone, however, they did not.  I usually go to Outback as I like the soften of their meat and the ease at which it comes off the bone.   Now, there are others who really like their ribs, but for me, it just wasn't what I was expecting, so if you are expecting an outback type ribs, you will be disappointed.  But again, this is only my opinion and you may just love them like many others do!  The sauce is really good, I can say at least.    But this is what sets this restaurant apart from many others, and that is how they handle an unhappy customer.  The owner took the ribs off my bill, offered me something else, then brought me a complimentary side of chili/beans which were very good.  And then he brought out table a dessert to share for free.  To me, that would make me come back to try their pulled pork, which my roommate enjoyed.    It's rare these days where you find owners really appreciative of the patrons business, and that's something that I fully value as a customer.",

My Midwest family got some smoked turkey and pork sandwiches and the consensus was that their lunch was \"Good, but expensive.\"  We came here because we are a Saint Louis people and Saint Louis people 1 apparently love BBQ and 2 love scouting out other Saint Louis people, and this place is run by a STL family. I grabbed a salad, average, but was impressed with my green chili mac n cheese (it had corn and red peppers in there too!) and the gooey butter cake. No one can make gooey butter cake like my mom, but this was pretty good.  The inside design was cool and the kids staffing the counter were friendly and talkative. Pretty much everything is ala cart. If you like meat and eating in places with that smoke house smell and you aren't on a budget this is a good place to try.",

    "text": "My first time today at this BBQ restaurant, which has been open for about 8 months, according to the very friendly employee who came to clear my plates.   I arrived shortly before 2 PM on a Wednesday, just outside of the peak lunch period, and during my roughly 30 minutes in the restaurant I was the only customer around.  The interior decor is rather simple and rustic, but comfortable, and a nice repertoire of blues tunes played in the background through speakers.  You order your food from the counter, and your order is then delivered to your table on a plastic plate.   You then pick up your plastic utensils from a common table which also contains a selection of three house BBQ sauces.   I tried the \"Spicy\" and \"Tennessee Tang\"  sauces.  The former is a thick red sauce with only mild heat, but it was still quite flavorful.  (Might be more accurate to label it \"A Tiny Bit Spicy.\")  The latter sauce is thinner in consistency, and it too has a modest amount of tang, but it still nicely complimented the smoked pulled pork and chicken that I ordered.  The pulled pork and chicken were tasty, with a nice smoked flavor.  I would describe both meat selections as neither too dry nor ideally moist.  They were both tasty and flavorful, though perhaps not exceptional.  My chosen sides were green chili mac & cheese and corn.   The corn was firm, with the right amount of crunch (who likes soggy corn anyway?), and my guess is that it is served straight from a can.  The green chili mac & cheese was good, though, once again, not exceptional.  There was almost no perceptible heat.   As other reviewers have noted, the cheese sauce is also very thin and watery, and not very \"cheesy.\"  Still, it was tasty, and I finished the modest portion of this side without regret!  My lunch bill totaled $17, a bit pricy given that the food was not exceptional, and the portions were on the small side.   The folks behind the counter were friendly and enthusiastic (at times, they seemed to be trying a bit too hard to enthusiastically welcome me as a new customer...).  As this was my first visit to this BBQ joint, I will definitely need to come back a few times to sample other items on their menu.  I did enjoy my meal, and the exuberant service, although the price seemed a bit on the high side (for the reasons that I've already mentioned, above).  Based upon this one experience, I don't think that I'd drive across the Valley to dine here.  But we live relatively close to this restaurant, and i believe in supporting independent/local restaurants, and so I do plan to return for at least a second visit.",

First the good: the pork ribs and brisket was decent not great. Service was fine and place was clean.  The bad: Pulled pork was dry and tasted / looked as if sitting out for hours. Mac N cheese tasted watered down and overcooked...the cheese sauce was thin and did not taste much like cheese at all...like if you watered down velveeta 1 part cheese and 4 parts water. Yuck. Then threw a can of chiles in it. Next the corn was chewy and tasted like frozen corn that has been overcooked in a pot all day.  Overall just not great food. Rudy's is better I think...and that isn't saying a whole lot.  I wanted to like this place. The dogs will love it however. Bringing home all of the pulled pork to feed them.",

    "text": "New places can be a little scary for the first few months...they haven't figured everything out between the food and the service and as excited as we always are for new places, we don't want to be let down because the company hasn't gotten their stuff together yet, but this place...as far as I am concerned, has got it together.   We went for lunch and sat at the bar and had a great server/bartender who chatted with us but also left us alone if we were eating or talking with each other - he was great. He suggested a few things on the menu - like the tri tip instead of the brisket - which were good. We got the three meat platter, green chili mac and cheese and the chicken wings. The chicken and pulled pork were the favorites while the tri tip was good...we liked the others better. Our favorite sauce was the Tennessee sauce - tangy and spicy and I could have drank the stuff. The mac and cheese was delicious as well! Some of our favorite wings are the grilled wings we get at LGO and Frasher's was up to par with their wings - yes that good.   I loved what they did inside compared to how the old Baja Loco was. It was natural wood and a great, simple vibe focusing on the food and service. The patio has upgraded furniture which looks comfortable and inviting and we can't wait to go back and hang out there.   George, the owner, was there and making his rounds. He seemed like a really cool guy and was really proud of his product...as he should be. I would love to go back and chat with him again and try more things on the menu!",

Although there is only cornbread and gooey butter cake, don't get them......you'll want more! The gooey butter cake is so good. I haven't had the cornbread but, you know, cornbread is always great tasting. When I came here, they gave us a slice of gooey butter cake, for FREE! Trust me, just go here and decide for yourself.",

    "text": "Having waited as long as I could for the opening jitters to clear and for Frasher's to dial things in, I think I timed it perfectly.  A quiet Monday lunch, I was there five minutes after opening, so I could be sure to get everything I wanted.  We were greeted with a smile as we perused the menu.  They've got Brisket, Chicken, Turkey, Burnt Ends and some other stuff.  Sorry, I just homed in on what I was hungry for.  It was tough to decide, so we spread it out.  Everything is sold by the pound which makes it easier to order different items, like you are not stuck with a half-pound of something when you want to try other things.  The meats (except chicken wings) come dry, and they provide squirt bottles of a sweet and a hot bbq sauce.  I tried the hot and it was awesome.  Not really hot, but very tasty.  They got my vote.  The brisket has just enough chew to it so that it does not fall apart all over the place, The burnt ends are a tasty treat and the chicken wings are large and freshly-cooked, slathered with a mild hot sauce they are actually \"finger-licking good\"  We also had the green-chile mac which sported a very mild green-chile flavor and was a bit thick.  I prefer my mac a bit creamier, but I can live with this version.  The only real problem I had was that they served our dishes in takeaway containers.  Which would be okay if we were actually ordering to go.  We were dining in and it was difficult to grab the brisket sandwich out of the tight-fitting container.  I would suggest that they provide plates for dine-in customers.",

You're pretty much going to enjoy anything you order. The flavor of the meat was so incredible that it didn't even need bbq sauce. But that didn't stop us from trying all the flavors. Their drinks were great. They had a full bar. Service was wonderful. The manager gave us our dessert complementary and personally served us. Anytime management is involved in service I think that's a good sign of a well cared for restaurant. We will be back!",

The corn bread is a dessert, slightly sweet and served cold. Delicious!  They have three sauces: Tennessee tame, sweet and spicy. We tried all. They were great. The ribs fall off the bone and the rub used is delicious.  The baked beans have a work detail flavor, with two kinds of beans used and the Mac and cheese was nice and spicy.   They also have St. Louis style pizza. The 341 menu.   We will be back. A new go to restaurant.",

The Mac and cheese had just the right amount of Chile flavor, and they had a large variety of barbecue sauces to choose from - our favorites were the spicy Tennessee and the sweet.

Unfortunately they were out of burnt ends but the pulled pork made up for it.

The restaurant in general is clean with a good amount of seating and they have some patio tables too.

Everything was amazing, and was devoured immediately, but the real star of the show was Flash Fried Spinach. Who does that? Apparently Frashers does, and it melted in your mouth and tasted awesome. Our server, I forgot her name, was such a great person, and even took us outside to take our picture. It was my Wife's Birthday, and we will never forget how much fun we had. Thank you sooo much.",

    "text": "This is such a great place! George Frasher wants to help put Phoenix on the map as a BBQ mecca.   The meats are served plain and you can choose amongst three different types of sauces. This makes the  BBQ experience more personalized and less messy!   I had chicken and my friend had ribs. Don't expect fall off the bone...George says that's a sign they're overcooked!   Mac and cheese was tasty as was the cole slaw. Oooey Gooey Butter Cake (George's mom's recipe) is like the top part of a frosted bundt cake. And Moscow Mule was great and came in a copper mug which many restaurants don't have!   Worth noting: they fry their spinach so it's like crispy spinach chips - delish!  When you say BBQ that can mean a lot of different styles, so check out the maps and look at all the different regional variations.   Highly recommended!  I heard George Frasher speak at the AZ Central Food and Wine Experience. I thought his sincerity and pure love of cooking and BBQ was very endearing. I had also tasted the food at the event so I KNEW it would be good!",

On this trip I had the Tri-Tip platter with baked beans and coleslaw.  The meat was tender and moist... not dripping as if it was stored in juices, rather as if it was properly cooked and just kept warm, without drying out.  The beans were a meal in themselves.   Did miss the sweet-tea, but wasn't brave enough to try the watermelon tea.  The menu also has pizza, and Burnt Ends... I'll have to go back soon to explore more!",

The beans are amazing the ribs are good. Pulled pork is tasteless can't even make it better with sauce. It's oddly watery in my mouth. The brisket was room temperature and each peace of slippery meat was separated by thick firm fat that reminded me head cheese. The mac and cheese was so bland I wanted to cry. The toast they gave with the platter was crispy but drenched in butter. Corn bread was good. Sauce is alright my favorite was the one in the middle I think it said Tennessee on it. The mashed potatoes are dry bland and tasteless and didn't come with gravy. I can't imagine how this would all taste if I wasnt absolutly starving after working 10 hours. I saw the owner or manager from across the room he seems nice. The staff is friendly.",

I'm glad I finally did the other night while looking for a place for a quick bite with my mom. The first thing I noticed about Frasher's was just how friendly everyone was - from the man out front out held the door open and greeted us to the girl who took our orders to the guy who brought out our food - everyone seemed genuinely happy and that really makes a world of difference in your dining experience.   Much like many other smokehouse or BBQ places, this is your counter-ordering and then open seating experience. The decor is inviting with a large patio out front which is exactly where we landed on this lovely spring/winter night. We ordered the burnt ends sandwich with no bun and the chicken with no bun along with the green chili mac and the mashed potatoes to share. We also got a slice of the butter cake to split as well.   The food came out very quickly, was hot and was reasonably portioned. I thought the sides were a little small, but that could be just how they presented them in a tiny little stryofoam cups on the plates. The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth good and I seriously could go back just for that again and again. The burnt ends were decent, I've had much better but they did not disappoint me in any way - just not the best version of a product that I'm a HUGE fan of. The slice of cake was small but it was the perfect size because of how rich it was - tasted just like Christmas butter cookies that we make every year. A great treat for the end of a nice meal. I might just have to stop by for a to-go order tonight, really good experience.",

I very much appreciate his effort doing this, customer service is always important. It wasn't very busy so we were able to get right in, ordered, and seated. That's unfortunately where the good ends.   Unfortunately, the food was just mediocre and it was priced too high for the quality of food. The brisket was dry, tough and lacked the good smokey flavor that you expect at a place called a \"smokehouse\". The food cooled very quickly and dried out once it was on the plate . I had to add BBQ sauce to the brisket which is a total no-no, and makes me cry. I spent $16 and really regretted it. I'm not sure what they're process is but it seems like they cook it into \"the stall\" and then take it out of the oven. It didn't seem like they pushed it to the right internal temperature for it to come out tender. Good BBQ takes time, and this brisket tasted and felt rushed.  All in all, if you have to add BBQ sauce and use a knife to cut brisket, it's wrong. But the guy running it was friendly, so it gets 2 stars.",

Ribs, smoked turkey, gumbo, cornbread and gooey butter cake were all top notch. Also, tried the wings which were stellar. Fried, then grilled=AMAZING. George the owner and his staff were super friendly and you can tell they love what they do. Cant wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!",

Love the ambiance and I was so happy to see the Gooey Buttercake still on the menu. I ordered the Turkey sandwich and my boyfriend had the Brisket. The meat was so tender and juicy and the BBQ sauce was some of the best I've had in AZ. The french fries came out hot and perfectly crispy!!! Looking forward to coming back. OH, And the gooey buttercake is just as amazing as I remembered. Impeccable customer service.",

Every time I go in I am shocked how dead it is inside and this place could definitely use some extra business.  The tri-tip is to die for, super juicy and tender with a ton of flavor. Same with the turkey, which most places seem to overcook.   The sides are amazing, I highly recommend the mac n cheese. It also sounds like they do a lot of catering so ask about that too!",

Nice informal spot where you simply order upfront and find a table and they bring the food to your table.   They have a table with three different sauces for your meat.. Spicy, Tennessee Sweet and Sweet. I didn't try the spicy but my favorite was the Tennessee Sweet. They offer meats as as a sandwich or platter. I opted for the smoked turkey with the house salad and corn.  Service was friendly and fast. I especially loved the smoked turkey.. with or without BBQ sauce, it tasted great. Corn was fresh and delicious. I would highly recommend this place. Actually shocked it wasn't more people in this establishment!",

Anyways I had a craving for BBQ so I dropped in. I got there in just in time before they closed.  I ordered two 2 meat combos for takeout. I got brisket and pulled pork. Each combo comes with two sides. I choose  coleslaw + green chilli mac n cheese.   The other combo I got smoked turkey and ribs. Sides: Green Chilli Mac + Baked Beans  The guy behind the counter thru in FREE DRINKS & cornbread!!  I have to admit the brisket was a bit dry, but happy it wasn't fatty pieces like most places I have tried.  The pulled pork was smokey and not bad. Thier spicy bbq sauce is ok.  I was really disappointed on the Green Chilli Mac. I would of thought it be more spicy. The coleslaw I wasn't impressed with either every bland.  Had an odd after taste and tangy.  The smoked turkey was really good. The ribs I've had better, but they were fast. Now the best part was only really their baked beans and the FREE cornbread. Stuff was amazingly delicious.  I can't say I would go back just to try the pizza.",

The servers really worked as a team answering questions and even offering a taste test of the meat I was deciding between. They have many homemade sauces and flavors.  The owner with a big smile on his face and attentive to every tables needs.   I have a gluten allergy and not all but some of the meat is gluten free and all most all of the BBQ sauces are gf also. Grateful for that!   I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes- so good even got a small serving to go! The baked beans were a little different than what we were expecting, more like a chili with ground beef with it.  The brisket was amazing and we enjoyed the tri tip as well, but preferred the brisket.  The coleslaw was ok, it looked great but was a little watery for my taste.   We will definitely be back lots of big tables for large groups, fun place for family dinner, especially if you have a Taylor Swift fan in the group!  Several autographed pictures of the musician on the way to the bathroom!",

But you don't want to do the smoking yourself.  You have a smoker, you can smoke the sh*t out of meat, but you're feeling lazy.  LOL  What do you do?  You scour Yelp to find a BBQ place that sells Burnt Ends.  In comes Frashers.  I know the location well.  It used to be an old Chuey's. I used to go there.  But hadn't been to try out this BBQ joint. After calling a few places, Frasher's was the best price, and could have my order of 2 lbs of burnt ends ready for the party the next day.  AND it is just a stones throw from my house.  Bonus.  I get there and the place definitely smells like a BBQ joint. They have my order of burnt ends ready to go. I take a look at the menu board and decide to also buy 2 sandwiches to go for myself, J, and C to share for lunch. The party J and I were attending wasn't until later that afternoon.  The sandwich portions were huge! There was plenty for the 3 of us to share. The sides were decent. And the burnt ends later on that afternoon, a HUGE hit at the party!!    We'll be back for more BBQ.  :D",

    "text": "How great to find a St. Louis restaurant and bar! Really cool that they have a \"314\" menu with St. Louis specific specialties like thin crust/Imo's style pizza, toasted ravioli, St. Louis salad, st. Louis style ribs, burnt brisket ends and gooey butter cake! All of which were excellent.  ***Atmosphere***: this place is pretty wide open and casual with a small bar that faces a single screen TV. The whole restaurant only has three TVs and they are not as big and easy to see as you may want if you're looking to really watch a game. If you're close-up, it's not bad. Of course Frasher's, I don't believe, is supposed to be a sports bar, more of a good restaurant, and they still offer the opportunity to watch games. So, that's good. It's clean inside and comfortable. Noise levels are average and the overall feel is \"bbq joint and bar\", not like a \"sports bar\" or a \"sit down restaurant.\" The table/booth layout can only be described as \"random\", so that was a bit strange. Tables and booths in different areas facing different directions. Definitely no feng shui here, ha! Having not been there before, we weren't sure whether we order at the counter or if there is table service. Turned out, it was kind of both. You order your main items upfront at the counter and pay there and then they bring the food to you. If you aren't sure, and sit at a table, one of the nice folks that work there, will bring over a menu and explain it to you. When they bring your food to your table, which was quick, you can then order directly from them additional drinks and small items.  ***Service*** Overall, the service was very good. The gals that bring your food and run the counter were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Food is served very quickly and service is clearly a priority. It seemed that the manager/bartender definitely listened to us more than he listened to the gals providing service to us when there was an issue with the TVs. Ultimately, he too was friendly and accommodating after the situation was explained, so that was good.  ***Food*** The food here was very good. I posted pictures of virtually everything we ate with descriptions. We had a 10 inch St. Louis style burnt ends pizza that definitely brought me back to email was in St. Louis. It was phenomenal! It will set you back $15, but if you've missed St. Louis style pizza or have never had it, it's totally worth it! We also had toasted raviolis and a St. Louis salad. Both of them brought me back to \"Rich and Charlie's\" in Chesterfield, Missouri and were both fantastic. The ravs were hot and crunchy and the chunky marinara sauce was spot on. We also selected the two meat combination with sliced brisket, pulled pork, french fries and deep fried spinach, yes, really \"deep fried spinach.\" The spinach was incredible, have never had that before and it was delicious! Fries felt like they were hand cut and while they're want to many of them, they were very good. The pulled pork was exceptional, usually it requires dousing in sauce for flavor, but this pulled pork didn't need any sauce, it was smoky and flavorful without being greasy. The brisket was very good and I was surprised because it was cut thicker and looked dryer than I typically like, but the flavor was outstanding and it didn't taste dry at all. They offer three different styles of sauce, spicy, sweet and Tennessee. None of them blew my socks off, but they were all decent and added appropriate flavor when needed. The gooey butter cake, although five dollars for a relatively small slice, was exceptionally good, definitely a treat that you don't get often outside of St. Louis. Drinks were also very good, poured well and served at appropriate temperatures, nice cold beer and generously poured mixed drinks. They don't offer happy hour or food and drink specials beyond a single food specialty each day. They offered deep fried catfish and hush puppies the day we were there, but we simply couldn't eat anymore. That would've been fun to try!  ***Overall*** Frasher's was a very good place. Clean and friendly with quick service and clearly homemade foods. While the layout is a bit odd and some prices are a bit high, it was definitely worth the hour round-trip drive for us. We watched the Saint Louis blues win game four of the Stanley Cup semi finals along with other St. Louis fans while we all enjoyed True St. Louis style food in a comfortable, laid-back, friendly setting. Would I return and would I encourage you to do the same? Yes, absolutely!",

    "text": "I've driven by Frasher's plenty of times and didn't think it looked like anything special from the outside. As a result, I came in with pretty average expectations and am happy to say that Frasher's exceeded my expectations.  We came during lunch on a Friday and the restaurant wasn't full, but did have a few customers both before and after we came in. You order your food at the register and then it's brought out to your table. The cashier talked us through the menu since it was the first time for most of us. After ordering, the food came out pretty quickly.  I ordered the combo plate with ribs, burnt ends, green chili mac and cheese, and corn. The meats were really good and a large reason why Frasher's gets a 4 from me. The burnt ends are super savory, they appeared to be pork belly instead of the usual brisket but I'll take any kind of burnt end to be completely frank. The ribs were a good size, super tender and flavorful - they're definitely in the upper tier of ribs that I've had in the Valley.  The sides weren't the best. The green chili mac and cheese sounded and looked good, but were very bland. I didn't really detect any flavor, let alone green chili. I'd skip this next time. The cashier told us that the corn was smoked and then cut off the cob, which intrigued me. It was pretty solid and I might get it again if I try the other sides and none of them call out to me.  I ordered the corn bread as a side without paying attention to the board and seeing that it was listed as a dessert. At first I was skeptical when it came out and looked saturated with honey/syrup, but boy was I wrong. That thing really hit a spot that I didn't even know existed. The texture and taste was reminiscent of a pancake that's been sitting in butter and syrup for a while, and I freaking loved it. The corn bread will be a must order every time I'm back here. It might even be a bigger contributor to the rating than the actual BBQ.",

Be sure to ask about their secret 314 menu if you want a taste of True SAint Louis specialties. Their BBQ is delicious, there are a lot of side options as well. I really love the feel of this place it's casual and great for groups. Beer is cold and the food is great!",

I've visited here a few times for work lunches, and you can bet you're going to get some damn good meat.  Their Tri Tip is always super tender and has a great smoke flavor, the chicken is never dry and always flavorful.  You can't go wrong with some good pulled pork either!    I will say the one thing that can be hit or miss here is the brisket, and burnt ends.  I love smoking in my back yard and I know how challenging this cut of meat can be to get right and even the pros can't get it right 100% of the time which is totally understandable.  They also have some awesome choices for sides.  Their Mac and cheese is super good, with a little green chili kick added in.  I love their corn and beans as well!  Besides it being a little pricey, this place always delivers just what you're wanting when you hit up a BBQ joint.",

I was a bit surprised to find they had a price increase from $10 to $14 for a 1/2 pound with 2 sides.  I ordered anyway because usually they are really good.  Sad to say the ribs were not that great.  I don't know if they changed suppliers, receipe or the chef but the meat was different. Or maybe it was me and just not my day. lol  I am not sure I'll be back.  My dog will be happy though.",

This was my first time having a dish with just the burnt ends and I thought it was pretty good. It was tasty and fatty.  I would most likely order something different next time only because I also love tender brisket. It was a little too much to just have the burnt ends.  For the sides, I had a difficult time choosing between the mashed potatoes and the green chile mac n cheese. The gentleman behind the counter was very nice enough to give me a free side.   I will definitely come back to try some of their other dishes.",

The ribs and pulled pork were outstanding super tender, with a lot of smoke, natural flavors and not too greasy  The brisket was underwhelming and the reason for only 4 stars. While the brisket is tender it seems like it has been boiled or steamed and is flavorless without the house BBQ sauce [spicy sauce is Ab Fab!!]  The Texas toast side seemed superfluous and had prob been pre prepared as was soft and lukewarm.  We added a Takeout order of the pulled pork on our way out, to go with bean and coleslaw leftovers later!! Great service and perfect 'Q' ambience. We will be back!",

    "text": "Plenty of parking, easy access and in a great area make this place very appealing. Frasher's is an order at the counter restaurant, which is a nice change from the traditional place. The staff is very polite and willing to answer questions which is inviting. The atmosphere is very laid back and shorts and t-shirt would not be out of place. I went with a friend and his kids, which was no problem, as they have a pretty stamdard kids menu. As for my order, I chose the pulled pork sandwich, baked beans, and I asked for cole slaw on my sandwich (If you have had pulled pork in the south, this is a must). The beans were tasty, but honestly and in my opinion, standard fare at a BBQ place- not bad at all, bud did not stand out. As for the pulled pork sandwich, it was tasty, but again (my opinion), pretty standard. One thing I noticed was that even though it was a sandwich, the bottom slice of bread was soggy. Not a problem- I just used a fork, but considering I have had Truely legendary pulled pork sandwiches where the bun was not soggy, that was a tad dissapointing. The flavor was good, but again, pretty standard. Now, I am not saying this place is bad- I will go again and try something different because it seems that each BBQ place has one thing that is their specialty and I want to figure out what it is! Keep in mind that having spent years in the south, amongst some of the best BBQ masters out there, I am a hard sell to say a BBQ place is exceptional, but in my opinion, this place is good and worth trying.",

He came back later with our order to go along with a coupon for some credit.  He apologized that it took a while for him to get my drink.  Was definitely impressed but had to decline because I said I'm from California and wasn't too sure when I would be back.  So he hooked it up with some dessert instead.

I wish I had better way to describe my feeling of e \"ehhh\" regarding the brisket and pulled pork. They were cooked just right not dry or overcooked not super moist and juicy either. I think what was lacking was bbq seasoning. Some spots put out quality product where you dont even wanna dip it q. This wasn't there but..the sauces were good. I got the three meat platter with my sides being Mac cheese and I think the second was coleslaw. Mac cheese was green chili Mac cheese and not bad but kitchen 56 has set the bar for green chili Mac cheese. I liked the spicy and Reg bbq sauce..didnt love the Tennessee style. They do have a bar no draft beer but decent selection and surprisingly a few house cocktails. Definitely different crowd than when it was chuys. Modernized clean nice cool rustic feel. You order at register and they bring food out. I think it has potential I'm just not in love yet. The ribs have my attn though",

You'll notice that most of the pictures are of the decor not the food. It's a little expensive for BBQ which I wouldn't mind if the food were good.I hope the owners and managers pay attention to the negative reviews because the pre-slicing of meat and the steam table is sucking the True flavor from the meat. I had a 3 meat platter with Tri Tip, Brisket and Ribs. The Ribs had a little smoke flavor but we're dry from being sliced ahead of time and the bark had little flavor. That was the good part, the Brisket and Tri Tip had no flavor at all. The steam table had sucked all the flavor from the beef. There was no bark on either meat, I'm sure it's at the bottom of the steam pan. My wife had pulled pork and it was dry and had no flavor either. The sides were ok, we had frys and slaw this time. The Mac and cheese was pretty good when we tried it the first time we tried Frashers.   Owners please slice to order. The better BBQ places like Bryan's, Little Miss, or Pork on Fork all slice to order and it makes a huge difference. I'm sure you have great flavor when the meat comes off the smoker, I would really like to taste it. Good luck, I hope you can make some changes to improve the food. My BBQ friends and I will be waiting and watching we want to see you make it.",

The smoker is outside the front patio.  They have a small bar area but it isn't the kind of place you'd want to hang out in but the beverages are more just to go along with the meal.  Had a very small selection of craft beer and well drinks.  Service was good and friendly.",

So when I mentioned it to my son the other night, he suggested checking out Frasher's website to see if they carried it. (I'd completely forgotten that this place had opened in the old nearby Chuy's). They did! We went over to order some takeout for Monday Night Football -- and decided to try a few things ... A rack of ribs, pound of smoked turkey, side of beans, side of chili mac-n-cheese, and some cornbread later, the family has a new go-to for our carnivorous indulgences!!! Yum! This is the real KC-style deal: dry-rub-smoked-fall-off-the-bone-melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness!!! The sauces are okay, but not really necessary. The mac was good. But, those beans!! OMG! They're a meal unto themselves. When we realized we hadn't ordered any cornbread, they threw some in for us to try. Dee-lish!! Loved the friendly staff; devoured the amazing dishes; promised we'll be back -- again and again!",

I thought the turkey was underwhelming, but then again, I shouldn't be getting turkey when there's other better meat to be had. Spicy sauce is really good. The space has a nice build out and is welcoming, though I agree with another reviewer that the food delivery system (wandering around the place calling out names for each item) is inefficient. What got me was the prices versus portion sizes, as well as the sides. They don't really offer a complete meal with meat and a side or two, but rather everything is a la carte. So if you want a half pound of meat, a side, and a drink, you're looking at well over $20. While the food's good I just can't see that lasting in this neighborhood...might want to consider a price adjustment or a meal deal where someone can sample a couple meats and a side.",

It tastes like it's cooked in an oven and not smoked or even grilled.  -no flavor -no smoke ring -greasy -flavorless  Ribs and sides are decent. All of the flavor is in the sauce, but the meat is just bad.    Don't believe me, check out the smoke when you show up...oh wait there is none. They do have a side smoker but it looks like something I should have in my backyard. Not a restaurant.   Also, very pricey for what you get. My thoughts. Save your money or if you really need a fix try Little Miss.   Frasher's sorry for the review but please take this as advice as I want to see you succeed. Get some smoke and flavor on that meat. And work on your take out presentation. Fatty brisket floating in grease in a styrofoam box is not appealing.",

    "text": "Been involved in Barbecue in Midwest for over 20 years so always looking to try a new barbecue place..  Served for lunch at 11:45 and the place was about  1/2 full. First thing I noticed is everything is al-cart and way over priced for Lunch. They had no sampler platters and no combination meals so no real way to taste much. I ordered burn ends and they were out already. It's 11:45 lunch rush hasn't even started.  So I went with the brisket and baby back ribs with a side of beans. $23.00 for lunch. When they brought it to me they forgot my ribs.. Waitress said the probably gave them to someone else, so she grabbed an order from another waitress as she walked by the table. As for the sauce they had four to choose from; can only recommend the sweet.. Others are way over spiced and take way from taste of the barbecue meat. As for the meat the brisket was cooked well, good smoke ring and tender but no flavor and very little rub. Not worth the $7 for a sandwich. The beans were $3 for a half cup and was more like chili than backed beans.. If your  going to make baked beans in a BBQ joint don't put hamburger in them and make them thin. Then there was the ribs .. Oh my! They were horrible... Not done and very Fatty! No flavor. Not sure where they get their ribs but not impressed at all and being so underdone the fat didn't render out at all so it was like bitting into a cold piece of fat.  I could not recommend this place to anyone who likes good barbecue at a fair price. Sorry I won't be back",

So I had me some chicken. I give the chicken 5 stars; it was absolutely delicious, and priced fairly (1/2 lb for $8. So, they have at least one main dish right. The rest of my experience was lack-luster. Here's what went wrong:   ISSUES: ~ staff unorganized. This is not the fault of the staff; this is a management issue. Why open a place if it's not organized? ~ they ran out of bbq! I know it's cheaper to run out than it is to make a little extra, but it isn't very nice for the customer to only have one option ~ side dishes were good (green chili mac-n-cheese, and coleslaw), but severely overpriced. Those two sides cost us $6 and the portions were really small. Suggestion: if you are going to have small side dishes, just include it with the main course instead of jabbing everyone for every morsel on their plate. ~the bar didn't have basic liquors; just knock off brands. Also, what's a bbq place without beer on tap? ~ when we placed our order at the counter the process was not organized.  ~ pet peeve: hate it when I stand in line to order and the receipt I am supposed to sign has a line for a tip. I like to have my food served before I issue a tip. Isn't the reward supposed to come after the service?   I'm going to give this place another go in a month or so. If they can make a few corrections it could go from below average to great. In my opinion there's a-lot of work needed to achieve that goal. I want it to work. We need a great bbq place in these parts. Need a lesson on how? Go have a meal at Little Miss BBQ in South Phoenix. People stand in line there for the privilege of having great BBQ because it's that darned good.",

Baby back ribs were ok- a little dry and plain for my taste, I had to add a lot of bbq sauce to enjoy. Don't get the coleslaw- doesn't taste like anything! Meat filled chicken wings were excellent, hot sauce was just right! They also came with a generous portion of carrots and celery sticks. I would come back again just to try their sandwiches and to see what the buttery cake dessert is all about...",

    "text": "I was extremely excited and hopeful to try this BBQ. My aunt suggested I would love it.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite hit the mark of my favorite BBQ in Phoenix. The sauces are good... they get 5 stars.  Yet the briskett was refrigerator cold on the inside, microwave tepid on the outside, tough and absent of soul and lacked flavor. The cheeseburger, tho nice in size for a kids menu, came with no fixings and lacked anything characteristic of a good bbq place. Service wise, our \"waitress\" was great and exchanged our cold briskett for the cheeseburger yet the female bartender made sure we heard, \"the briskett is cold because of the bbq sauce you put on it..\"  The bbq was room temp... her theory left a cold taste in my mouth as did.her treatment of a homeless man who came in and asked for a glass of water which she dropped the cup into his hand to make sure she didnt.touch him and didn't even apologize.  Rude.  Not the dinner experience I was expecting after a great recommendation.",

You put sauce on them it's that much better, three choices: Spicy, Tennessee Tang, or Sweet, all we're good. Chicken wings were huge and delicious.

The food was delicious and came out quickly, as well as the drinks from the bar. My only suggestion would be to make sure the cooks have on gloves at all times and to state on the menu that the fries are sweet potato fries, however tasty they were, the menu only saying \"fries\" was a little misleading. Besides those minuscule things, I loved that the owner was there! He was personable and welcoming, even going to the extent of giving us one of the desserts to try! A Phoenix must-have :)",

I got in there super close to closing time and got my order to go. Unfortunately, they were out of a bunch of stuff (that's the way it goes when you get there late), but they made up for it by loading my bag with goodies to try...for free! What awesome people! We ordered ribs and gumbo and mac and cheese.....the ribs were awesome, the gumbo was so so, the mac was tasty. They gave us coleslaw, cornbread, and beans....so glad they did....the cornbread was incredible! Dangerously good. Diet destroyingly good. The beans were also fabulous. These would be must orders in the future. The prices here are very reasonable. I would 100% recommend Frasher's for your BBQ needs AND I need to return soon to try their mashed potatoes (and for mooooore coooornbread!).",

My work had Frasher's catered in to fill the gap between when our cafeteria closed and reopened and I was less than thrilled at the idea of having BBQ, even less thrilled at catered BBQ.   I was so pleasantly surpised! I had the chicken breast -- cooked and seasoned very well, not one dry piece. I sampled all their BBQ sauces: spicy, sweet, and tangy. All good flavors but liked mixing the spicy and sweet the best. The cole slaw was crunchy and flavorful, the beans had large chunks of beef and had a nice smoky flavor, the potato salad was par for the tater salad course. And the butter cake was great. I thought to myself that it wasn't going to be good because only Mastro's does butter cake the way that i like it but i have to say. This butter cake was good too, not going to give Mastro's a run for their money but also not what I think Frasher's is going for.   A total believer. If their catered food was this good, I bet dining in is 5 star worthy!",

Brisket....was that even brisket!?!! Tasted and had the texture of boiled meat. Burnt Ends: tasteless and mushy Baby Back Ribs: tasteless, greasy and mushy  Turkey gumbo: full of salt BBQ beans.....dry, tasted like the bottom of a pan Green chili mac and cheese: a scoop of mush!  Corn....half decent but full of butter 3 BBQ Sauces: all incredibly sweet  EVERYTHING left a greasy film in my mouth!  We should have never went in when there was only 1 other car in the parking lot.  To top this all off, as we left all of our inedible plates on the table, the waitress said absolutely nothing about all of the \"food\" we left, she actually hurried to clear the table.  Do not recommend at all.",

    "text": "Stopped into this sweet bbq place while visiting Phoenix. The place has a nice smokehouse feel when you first walk in. We were greeted immediately and looked over the simple, yet adequate menu. I decided to order the 3 meet sampler, and my meat choices were pulled pork, ribs and brisket. It came with two Sides so I took the cole slaw and mashed potatoes. The wife ordered burnt ends, beans and cole slaw.  If you're like me, then you've probably had some dry brisket. The brisket at Frasher's was incredibly moist and it was the best I've ever had. It was tender and juicy and had just the right amount of smoke. The ribs were good, a tad dry but packed full of flavor. The pulled pork was moist and piled high. The smoke flavor was a tad light on the pulled pork, but the other meats complimented it well.   The baked beans were also the best I've ever had. Not too sweet, slightly savory and packed full of smoky flavor. The cole slaw had a nice flavor to it and was a bit tangy for my taste. The garlic mashed potatoes were just as good as any I've had at a 4-5 star restaurant. Now, on to the burnt ends. OMG, they were amazing. My wife ordered them and the portion size was so big we packed up her leftovers to go. The flavor was rich and smoky with just the right meat to fat ratio.   Overall, we really like Frasher's and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of its BBQ. We will definitely need to make another trip to Phoenix to get the opportunity to visit Frasher's again.",

We tried several items. The gooey butter cake dessert was definitely the highlight! The ribs were also delicious. The pulled pork was very good. The tri-tip was ok. The brisket was not very good, no smoke ring and a lot tougher than I would anticipate. The sides were mostly ok. Mashed potatoes were the best. The corn was so-so. The mac and cheese was tasty but could've use a little more spice. The sauces were all ok as well. Overall, I'm not mad about it but we won't be hurrying back.",

When you walk in, you have to go to the counter to order and pay, then they'll bring it to you. Or you can always sit at the bar. We went at dinner time and it wasn't too busy. We both got ribs and then the hot mac and cheese, beans, and cornbread.  The ribs come unsauced, but are sooo delicious and not super fatty or anything. The sauces that they have are sweet, Tennessee tang, and hot. The best is the sweet but I wish they had some better sauces.   The spicy mac and cheese was cheese my and jalapenoy deliciousness. Super ooey gooey and very filling.   The baked beans have meat in them and are kind of like a chilli with a whole lot of flavor! They could be a meal all on their own.  The cornbread is fine, but I wished it had been sweeter, it was a little dry for my taste.",

Some things aren't on the regular menu but Friday you can have some amazing fried cod. Occasionally tender steaks may be available. The food is fantastic,the sides really good and help yourself to bbq's sauce,got a roll of fresh paper towels to make it less messy. Family freindly, and the owner meets every customer,greets is a better  word, with a smile, makes sure that each person is satisfied. George  Fraiser.

We also loved the baby back ribs and the tri-tip. I love me some well-made mashed potatoes and holy cow, the garlic mashed potatoes did not disappoint. Tasted exactly like my mother's famous mashed potatoes! Now I don't have to wait for Thanksgiving whenever I get the craving . When the nice guy at the counter heard it was our first visit, he brought us a slice of the gooey butter cake on the house. Oh my goodness. Really, OH MY GOODNESS. I'm the type that would always order dessert first if it were socially acceptable (okay okay, if my husband would let me ) and this dessert BLEW MY MIND. I truly don't think I can waste my time on a lesser dessert ever again, that's how good it was. If I were still pregnant, it would have seriously brought me to tears of joy.",

    "text": "We're back in the Phoenix area for the winter, and yesterday we went to Frasher's Smokehouse.  We used to go to George Frasher's Steakhouse in Scottsdale, but he moved to this location and is doing a bar-b-qua menu.  Oh, my gosh!!  The pit masters at Memphis in May have nothing on this place.  We've been to some of the greatest BBQ restaurants in the country during our extensive travels, and this ranks up there with the best.  My husband had the smoke chicken platter, my sister and I both had the burnt ends, and my brother-in-law had the brisket.  All were amazing!!  meat was tender, smoked nicely, and the sauces were fantastic.  (I mixed the sweet and the Tennessee Tangy sauces, and everyone else had the spicy sauce.)  George, the owner, makes all his sauces from scratch.  The sides are great.  The baked beans also have a great smokey flavor, and is full of chunks of pulled pork.  The corn tastes like it came right off the cob. I got a piece of the gooey butter cake to take home, but I was so full, I didn't get a chance to try it, yet.  (Looking forward to diving into that later today.)   While we were eating, George came over and let us all try one of his ribs (fall off the bone great!), his creamed corn (yummo!), and his cooked greens.  A little later, he brought out two samples of his gumbo and small piece of jalepeno cornbread.  Everything tasted fantastic.  The decor of the restaurant is really cool.  The place has a great vibe.  You would swear you were in Memphis or New Orleans when you walk in.  The background music has a definite cajun and/or blues theme, which makes the eating experience complete.  All the details in the restaurant were carefully orchestrated to help you enjoy the entire eating experience.  Even the bathrooms were decorated in a very cool way.  The sink vanity is a big wine cask, with wine corks lining the sink.  The bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint, and there's a small bucket of chalk on a shelf near the sink so you can leave messages for the next \"patron\".  Just a lot of fun!  Overall, I'd say George Frasher has a huge hit on his hand with Frasher's Smokehouse!    Bravo!!",

    "text": "This was the worst Smokehouse/BBQ Food ever made for consumption,I would compare it to food thrown on the floor and then out to the dump perhaps,The server to get our order was very pleasant,Once we got home thats when the sh** hit the fan. $10.00 for a brisket sandwich that had a soggy bun and no sauce on it.The turkey was pure sh**.it was dry and the slices even looked pathetic. The Tri Tip was hard as little rocks on a hamburger bun.We were supposed to get beans as a side and we wound up with chili that had jalapeno,s.The corn was so bad that no one could even swallow it down, I wouldn't give that to prisoners in Sheriff Joe,s care. We were very upset and disappointed with Frasher,s. Being from California really makes us miss The Hat in Brea Ca.Now thats a sandwich",

I was greatly saddened when they're Steakhouse had closed on Scottsdale Road. So last Saturday we tried the place for lunch. My wife had the brisket and I had the burnt tips. It was pretty good the garlic mashed potatoes are still the bomb. Tonight we went back my wife had a combination platter of brisket and tri-tip and I had a 10 ounce ribeye. Awesome food. I really enjoyed the steak. It was a lot of food we had so I couldn't enjoy the gooey cake but let me tell you that's to die for. Thank you George for another great meal.",

I asked about the baby back ribs and she said with confidence those are what everybody likes ( don't quote me word for word) well she wasn't kidding!  She was so cute although they take the order at the front when you come in and then bring the food when cooked, I  still gave her a $6.00 tip . When  she gave me change from my 20.00 bill ( Oh yes did I tell you my meal was only 13.00 and change!!!) I said keep the change and she was so honest as to say wait this is 6.00 (when someone can put a mile on your face like she did with impeccable customer service, she deserves a big tip!!!Ok now to the ribs!!!The rib meat fell off the bone and into my mouth! The coleslaw which they make with a vinegar dressing instead of mayo was fabulous!! I can't say enough about this place!! Kudos to the owner who obliviously mentors his employees with his heart oh yes and don't leave without trying desert!!! Oh my goodness please excuse my punctuation as I was not able to gather my bearings an incredible establishment that just fell into my lap!!!!!!",

When I first walked into Frashers, I was a bit cautious: everyone (from the staff to the clientele) is white!  Just like you can gauge the authenticity of a Chinese restaurant by how many Chinese people dine there, I feel more reassured with bbq when I see African Americans doing the cooking and eating. But the bbq here is Legit. I ordered both the burnt ends sandwich and the baby back ribs, and the staff assured me it would be enough for a good meal.  The burnt ends I wasn't crazy about: more of a novelty item, an acquired taste. A bit tuff and chewy.        But the back back ribs. OH. my. God. The baby back ribs is Hella good. The bbq sauces, which u serve urself, is On Point. What I noticed as a good touch is that Frashers toast their bread on the griddle. Everett & jones just serve wonderbread in a sandwich bag. It's a very nice touch, a solid finish on the execution.  And toss in how friendly and nice the staff is, and the very reasonable prices, and Frasher is A WINNER.",

The I got the burnt ends today which was prepared like greasy carnitas is. The pork was fatty and greasy and I've had a stomach ache all day.

My wife and I got the baby back ribs and burnt ends (translation: the good parts of the brisket) which were amazing on their own.  Then add one of their three bbq sauces (we loved the spicy sauce, there's also Tennessee Tangy and a Sweet BBQ sauce) and it makes these meats mouth-watering.  I would go back just for the Baked Beans which are some of the tastiest beans I have had.  The corn side is grilled on the cob then sliced off -- delicious as well.  The owner, George (previously of Fraser's Steakhouse), came out to check on all the guests which was a nice touch.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying the Tri-tip and Turkey!

I guess this is common from some of the previous posts but I just can't get to a restaurant any earlier because of work. They did have wings left so I ordered them but at $9.00 for one pound I felt they were a bit overpriced and reminded me of the ones I buy at Costco in the bag, 5 pounds for around $15.00. I ordered two sides and as mentioned by other reviewers, they were $6 each and VERY small. They say 1 cup, but seemed smaller to me and the coleslaw was not really even ONE ample portion, for $6.00 I expect more. Staff was disorganized but friendly and I really love the decor, they did a great job. I hope they work out the kinks, I am all for supporting the local family business. If they re-evaluate their side portion prices and get it together regarding the running out of their main food it could be good. I will come back in a few months and try again. I am a bit confused though, I thought this store was basically just moving from a Scottsdale location where they had been successful so wondering why all the glitches. I hope they work it out.",
