    "text": "Mu Shu Asian Grill has a fast-food look/feel about it as a restaurant, and it appears most of their business is to-go, but the quality of the food is solid.  On a recent Saturday night, my spouse and I shared orders of peking beef, pork egg foo yung and ma pao tofu.  All three dishes were properly cooked and spiced and served at a piping hot temperature, along with plenty of rice. I think what I appreciated most is that none of our dishes came drowned in the typical, nasty canned sauces that most Americanized Chinese restaurants use.  Rather the food here reminded me of the food you'd actually get in Asia, such as from a street vendor or whole-in-the-wall restaurant.  Prices are quite reasonable too, with entrees ranging mostly from about $8-$10. The vibe of the place and the employee attitudes seemed pretty comfortable too.  Overall I really like this place for casual Chinese dining.  And they even throw a wedge of lemon in your icewater!",

You can tell that it is quality, but there is no \"pop\" to it. However, the mu shu wrap is outstanding (add a little plumb sauce), and the Mongolian grill is pretty solid but could use more options.   Here is your Mu Shu fortune cookie:  \"Your happiness will depend entirely on what you order.\"",

My sister has been telling me about this place for years but I never got around to trying it.  Now I know what I was missing.  We tried the hot and sour soup and it was wonderful.  I always judge Asian restaurants by their hot and sour soup and this was some of the best I have had.  We also tried the stir fry and I was amazed by the number of vegetable choices.  Everything from 2 kinds of cabbage, snow peas, spinach and zucchini.   There was enough in the bowl to split and still take some home.   The server and the owner both made a point of stopping at our table to make sure we were having a good time and that we had everything we needed.  The menu was pretty good and I saw lots of my favorite choices.  I'm going to have to force myself to try other things because the stir fry was so good and there were so many options, I could see just getting that every time.   I can't wait to recommend this place to all my friends who live in the area.",

    "text": "This is absolutely one of my favorite Asian lunch spots during the work week! It's like a Mongolian BBQ except it's CHINESE.  You select your meat (chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu), then your flavor (kung pao, classic, teriyaki), then choose between plain or fried rice or noodles, then you get a pretty wide range of vegetables to pick from, such as broccoli,  carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, snow peas).  It can get really crowded on a good work day, but you'll walk out full and satisfied.  I have been going here regularly and the best part about Mu Shu is the CONSISTENCY in the QUALITY!  $10 or less meal with a drink.",

Its a quick and easy concept and you'll end up with lunch, dinner and lunch again the next day - there's THAT much food for less than $9. You pick your meats and spices and the rest is up to you to load up your bowl with veggies as much as you'd like. Don't be scared - load them in there!  They grill it all up and serve it hot over rice. Its delicious and generous. While you wait, you can help yourself to crunchy noodle chips dipped in sweet and sour (delicious) and a soda fountain. I love that you're not waiting on servers but you still get that sit-down lunch vibe. A must try.",

To my disappointment, there was no meat to pick and very limited vegi for stir fry. so we decided to order the regular dishes.   There were just a couple of tables but the service was very slow. The dishes are very tiny for the price and the tea would cost extra.   Overall, This is NOT an authentic Chinese food restaurant. Might be a place that just caters the lunch for people working in downtown.",

    "text": "Well, I really wanted to like this place due to how close it is to our new home. However, we must have ordered the wrong items. First off, the staff is VERY friendly and made an effort to be courteous and attentive throughout the meal. Also the spring rolls were pretty darn good. Unfortunately for us, what came next tells a different story.   The almond chicken was very non-tradition being that it contained different veggies than usual and had shaved almonds sprinkled on top instead of cooked within the dish. The chicken spread throughout the dish is comprised of all dark meat fatty pieces. The pork low mein had rubbery strips of pork; looked and tasted oily. In fact everything we ate seemed to just slide down your throat because it was VERY greasy.   Again, maybe we ordered the wrong items. However, I don't know if we will ever know because most likely we will be headed back to China Chili.",

This trip I decided to take my entire team, which ranged from Chinese food pros, to a recent grad from Montana who had to ask me what half of the veggies were.  Overall we had a good trip, our food was good, the service was pleasant and overall it was a good value. Because it was a busy Friday it did take longer for our food to cook than expected. Also we got the last parking spot in the lot, if we were a few minutes later I don't know what we would have done.  I opted for the make you own stir fry with kungpow sauce. I recommend when filling your bowl you skip the broccoli until later as it just takes up excess space at the bottom. I went heavy on the tofu and pea pods this time. The food came nuclear hot so it did take some time for it to cool down enough to eat.  My coworkers were surprised by the volume of food and they seemed to enjoy their shezuan beef and chicken dishes.   I am not the food authority at the office, if some one is going out they now ask me where to go thanks to my recommendation of this place for lunch.",

I was not at all impressed with the seasoning options because they did not pop with flavor and taste relatively bland. They definitely give heaping servings to make sure your belly is full. I had to try the spring rolls because of all of the reviews which said they were excellent. As a spring roll aficionado, I am going to interject that there are several restaurants in the valley such as Chanpen and Unfogettable, which offer much better spring rolls at a better price as well. These taste pre-fried=greasy. Although the fountain drinks are in the dining area we're just can reach, it is only an option for the wait staff to give you your drink and it is not assumed that you would want a refill= 1 cup of fountain drink for $1.95. A little bummed that there is not a kids menu or kids portion. My four-year-old's chicken teriyaki was a whopping $9.95",

    "text": "We came here because they offered low carbs and my friend is on the Keto diet. While nothing seemed to particularly point to low carbs on their menu, the visit was incredibly memorable for a few reasons: Upon walking in we were surprised to find a full stir fry vegetable selection aisle as well as a well lit open table setting. The place was very very clean and really inviting, and we could see a huge line was already building at the register. We didn't know what we were getting and I didn't see a menu in sight unfortunately, but luckily the owner spotted us on our phones and quickly offered menus. The owner was incredibly kind and social, making conversation with each person that came. I ordered the mu shu wrap w/chicken brown rice and medium spice, while my friend ordered the stir fry with the spicy sauce. We were particularly hungry at this point so we threw in the beef on a stick appetizer. Really good pricing ($8) The beef on a stick was ready for us very quickly, maybe after 5 min, and came with a portable oven for us to roast the beef to our liking. We were really into the interactive part of this dish and it honestly made the experience 10x better. It was without a doubt delicious, highly recommend this appetizer. I should note that this whole time while we were eating, the waitress came by multiple times asking if we needed anything, and even brought to go boxes without asking us when we clearly needed them. really sweet person! I have never had mu shu before, but I've heard of it many times, which is pretty much why I ordered it. The mu shu wrap looked basically like a burrito, Asian style, and came with a side of a sweeter sauce. I subbed in the spicy garlic sauce they had near the drinks instead, and all in all, it was one of the best \"burritos\" I've had. cannot stress how absolutely delicious this wrap was! I think the spicy sauce really helped, but still great on its own. At the end, we thanked the same owner who took our order on our way out, and he asked us how we found out about the place. We told him Yelp and he mentioned that they don't advertise at all so that was really cool that we found out about their place. Because of that I thought I owed him a review (my first one), and because the place definitely deserved it.  5 stars easy, will be coming again!",

We ordered several items from the menu and each was delectable and tasty. Prices were very affordable, too!

If you choose the Asian grill you take a very large bowl and fill it with a wide variety of biased sliced, fresh veggies. I added baby bok choi to my mix. Then you request beef or chicken and order your drink and seat yourself. You also must order rice or what kind of noodles- flour or rice and which sauce. I chose rice noodles, chicken and teriyaki. There is self serve drinks, chili sauce(s), fried wonton and sweet and sour sauce. They call your name and you are ready to eat in the same bowl you used to select your veggies. I like to eat Asian food with chop sticks. I also dip the wanton in the sweet and sour- very good! The food is cooked perfectly, neither under nor overcooked. Kinda of a small meat portion but that's fine with me. The chicken was cooked perfect, the beef thin sliced and tender as it should be. I would have liked a shrimp choice but that's not the case. You can also order egg rolls and other standard side dishes. All-in-all the food was good, the bowl holds so much you need to take some home. I highly recommend Mu Shu, it is nice, clean, the Asian staff is friendly and there was a beautiful water color painting on the wall.",

The food is fresh tasting and everything I've had on their rather extensive menu is great.  They have the big grill, so you can either \"create your own bowl\" of goodness, piled high with a huge variety of fresh veggies and your choice of protein / sauces, or you can pick one of their menu favorites.  The space is fairly well lit for this type of establishment and is always clean and tidy.  The decor is sparten but the food is good enough to rise above the atmosphere.  Or have them pack all of your goodness up and take your food on the road.  Either way you will have a great meal for a decent price and still have enough left for another meal.  Mu Shu is everything a family owned restaurant should be topped off with a fortune cookie. :)",

The dine in restaurant is not what I expected.  It appeared that they had some type of buffet bar as part of the dining experience.  My food was ready by the time I arrived and stayed warm for the whole trip home.  I preface this food review with the warning that I am not a big fan of Most Asian foods. I tried the ginger garlic chicken and was not very impressed.  I'm sure that the food itself was good it was just not what I was expecting.  I also sampled the honey dipped chicken which was the more tolerable dish between the two.  The potstickers were very tasty.  I was a little disappointed with the crab puffs.  There didn't seem to be very much filling inside the fried wontons.  Despite not liking my dish I wouldn't mind trying this place again to see if I can find something on the menu, other than the potstickers, that is worth coming back for on occasion.",

We ordered take out since my husband and I were feeling somewhat under the weather, so I can't remark on the service; except that the very nice gentleman who handled the transaction (he seemed like the owner, but I'm not really sure) was awesome. He gave us a free 2012 calender! And I really liked his vest.  And, the food. We ordered staple basics...chicken lo mein, house special fried rice, teriyaki chicken, and some dumplings. They were all fantastic! The sauce for the dumplings was crazy spicy, though. The food was all a very acceptable level of American-style-Chinese-food greasy, not so much to give me a tummy ache, but juuust enough to make it tastier (in other words, not as good as China Grill in terms of no grease, but wayyy better than Chen & Wok, everything there gave me a bit of a tummyache). Everything seemed really fresh and we both thought everything was crazy delicious! And, $30 (no tip since it was take out) for all of that, and I still have some leftovers. Fantastic! I can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "This place is \"da bomb!\"  Been going there for about 10 years off and on, very close to Central Phoenix, easy access from westbound Thomas, just turn right into the parking lot (which can be crowded at lunchtime).  They are open daily 11a - 9p (EXCEPT SUNDAYS).  If you avoid lunchtime, you can get the shortest lines.  You can go very healthy with the self-serve stir fry by choosing lots of darker veggies, going with chicken, asking for half the amount of sauce and choosing brown rice instead of white rice.  I also avoid soy products and cabbage (thyroid issues), so I avoid the cabbage and the tofu that are available in the self-serve veggie buffet, but I get everything else and there are a lot of other choices of veggies (huge fresh spinach leaves, bean sprouts, green peppers, celery, mushrooms, cut zuccini, tomatoes, onions, pea pods, bok choy, etc., etc.).  It's a comfy little place to \"eat in,\" but personally I like to hit the self-serve buffet and split.    It's very convenient to the Central Avenue Business Corridor and is frequented by people who work near there during lunch, so try to go some other time like before or after the lunch hour to get in and out quicker.  The kung-pao sauce is very, very hot, so next time I think I'll ask for \"half Teriyaki sauce and half Kung Pao sauce,\" then ask for half as much total sauce as they usually provide -- otherwise the rice gets too soaked and the box leaks.  I also ask for the veggies to be stir fried lightly so they're crunchy (al dente) (why fry all the nutrients out of the veggies?).  I think next time I'll ask for aluminum foil to line the styrofoam takeout box so the sauce doesn't leak in my car and the hot food doesn't melt the styrofoam (a xenoestrogen), or if I think of it in advance I'll bring a sheet of aluminum foil with me.  Perhaps someday they'll change to a more environmentally friendly and healthier alternative to-go box made out of a paper product or something, instead of the current styrofoam box.  Very friendly service, especially the manager dude -- I can't believe he recognized me after like 4 years!  The place is SUPER CLEAN, but the restrooms are teeny tiny.  I fill my self-serve stir fry bowl to a mound of overflowing veggies and since they are fried only lightly (per my request), they don't melt down to a small volume, so there are leftovers for the next day.  My ONLY possible suggestion for them would be if they started serving MONSTER SIZED EGGROLLS.    Very casual dining/take-out, no need to dress up.  If you DO dine in, they have FREE REFILLS of sodas and iced tea at the fountain.  Do not pass \"Go,\" do not collect $200, do NOT miss Mu Shu!!!  These folks thought of self-serve stir fry YEARS BEFORE Mongolian BBQ came along...",

Pick you protein, chicken, steak or shrimp then go up to the bar in front of the opened kitchen to select your fresh vegetables. Choices of rice or noodles are also included.

We replied it was, so he walked us through how to order on an order sheet using the menu he gave us to look at.  It is akin to a Mongolian barbecue. We picked our protein, sauce-mild or spicy and then in a bowl we selected our veggies. Once that was completed, in the grill area they have your protein waiting to go with either rice or noodles. They offer steamed white rice or fried rice. If you select noodles it's $2.00 extra and beef is $1.00 more than the pork or chicken. We ordered hot tea and ice water. Our waitress brought our beverages and won ton chips with sweet and sour to our table. She checked with us frequently making sure everything was good and refilled our water and brought more won ton chips. She asked if we would like a container to take home what we could not eat and she brought a plastic bag to carry it out in.  Lastly, she brought out the fortune cookies. I really appreciated her and the excellent service she provided. The restaurant is clean and organized, it runs efficiently and has wonderful and caring staff. The food was fresh and delicious. The beef melted in my mouth, mmmm! We will be coming back in the future.",

First you choose from two types of rice or noodles,  mix in your choice of four diffrent sauces, select a protein (chicken, beef, pork, shrimp veggies). Then get ready to add some side dishes to compliment your entree, such as spring rolls or pot stickers.  If you want to try something diffrent but absolutely delicious, order a Mu Shu Wrap. It's  a huge tortilla filled with your choice of protien,  fresh onions, carrots, scallions, cabbage, bamboo shoots and mu shu sauce, all stir fried in a sizzling hot wok. On today's visit, I had the Steak Mu Shu Wrap and it was delicious.   At Mu Shu Asian Grill you are served such a generous helping you will be able to eat this meal twice.

I thought there was something wrong with my tastebuds today. However, one of my coworkers tasted it, and he also said it is very salty. Just like you are eating salts. I had the same pork last time and it wasn't salty like this. I'm not going back there ever again.",

The chicken was dry yet coated in soggy, mushy breading. The brown rice was dry. The egg roll lacked any sort of crispy crunch. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing for take out? I don't know. I just know I won't give them another try.",

The sauces they use for their stir fry are delicious and the vegetables they provide are fresh and crisp. The portions are large and it's hard to go wrong.   As for the pad thai they serve here, I have mixed reviews. The first time I ordered it it was bland and didn't satiate my craving for savory pad thai, granted this isn't a Thai place, but still. Then I ordered it again, but this time asked for EXTRA SPICE. It was a success! Much better than the first experience. Still not the best place for a pad thai lover but good if you're in need of a quick fix.   The only negative I have about this place is the service. Every time I came in I was never greeted with friendly smiles, or enthusiastic hellos. I like to be somewhat acknowledged somewhere when I come in often. The waitresses almost make me feel like they want me to leave. Besides that though, good food!",

Besides the variety of tasty options on the menu, they do build your own stir fry bowls. That is the option I went with. I loaded my bowl with a variety of veggies (bell pepper, red peppers, bean sprouts, spinach, onions, carrots, tomatoes) and paid $2.00 extra for noodles. The sauce I chose was a spicy ginger sauce and meat choice was chicken. My food was cooked fresh to order and came out piping hot. My friends meals were off the menu. I stabbed my fork in theirs which was good but not as good as mine.  Easy process at this restaurant. You walk in and pay for the items you choose. Then you sit down and they call your name. There is a server to check in on you once your seated.   I will be back this place is great.",

The inside ambiance feels more like a middle of the road buffet.  Cafeterias like chairs, no salt, pepper or sugar on the tables.         I ordered the happy family seafood dinner and egg drop soup.  It came fairly fast.  The soup while good, needed salt...but no salt on the table.   The happy family seafood meal was tasty and had large scallops, medium shrimp and Krab (imitation crab meat). It would have been better without the Krab meat.  It was hot, plenary was there, however the rice portion should have been a larger portion, as it was there was only enough for half the meal.   I ordered iced tea, they asked plain or sweet, since I could see there wasn't any sugar on the table I ordered it sweet.   It was ghastly, some fruity semi sweet slightly sour tea.   I would have appreciated it better if they had told me it was going to be flavored tea.  Personally I think it may have been sitting there all day because of the sour flavor.   The price for this meal, too high in my opinion.  With tip it was about $24.    For that much I would at least expect fresh tea and salt sugar and pepper on the table.  Go figure.     Would I go again?... perhaps.  I'd like to try their Pho. And maybe 1 other dish to give them a second try.   The people were friendly and somewhat attentive.",

The owner/manager was very nice and explained the menu. Since we all decided to have the stir fry, he then helped us decide how spicy for the sauces and also helped us decide what would be best--rice noodles, flour noodles or rice with each of our bowls. The rice noodles were very good with the mix of veggies that I added to my bowl.  I really liked that I didn't have to decide what size bowl, as all the bowls were the same size. I had shrimp in my stir fry. I was expecting smaller ones, but these were medium sized and very tasty.  Food was decent, but the people working here were so nice!

Whether it was the most bland garlic chicken I've had in quite some time, or the sesame chicken that was loaded with so much sugar that I questioned whether or not the sauce would not be better served on top of a dessert.   My understanding is this used to be a buffet, but transitioned to a 'real' restaurant. I think the buffet quality persists.

As this was our first visit, the owner/manager explained the menu choices to us and after a short discussion we all decided on the stir fry.   We headed over to choose our vegetables and this was the one piece of our dinner that didn't quite rate five stars as there were only about fifteen vegetable choices and, other than the bok choy, the choices were very American. I was hoping for a few more exotic Asian vegetables to choose from. However, they were all fresh and looked delicious.  We then chose our meat or seafood followed by our sauce. You can also elect to have noodles rather than rice, which I chose, to complement the pork and Kung pao sauce.  When the food arrived it was perfect. The flavor was wonderful. The spices were infused throughout the dish and eating it was a mouth-watering delight.  This restaurant should be on everyone's list of must go to at least once.",

This isn't authentic Chinese food by any means and they don't advertise themselves as such, so it's too bad people have taken away stars from their ratings for that reason.   This review is for dinner, never been for lunch or gotten take-out. We have gone half-a-dozen times for dinner since moving to central Phoenix a few months ago and we'll keep coming back. The owners and staff are always very friendly and efficient. The restaurant is neat and clean. The food is consistently fresh and tasty. What more can you ask for?  I am that person who finds something on the menu that they like and then always orders it. For me, that's a small hot and sour soup and their Ma Pao Tofu. Their hot and sour soup is really not very hot or sour, but it is the best iteration I've had flavor wise in the Valley. Ma Pao Tofu essentially means home-style tofu, so it's different everywhere you go. Their version is super fresh and healthy, not greasy or heavy. My dinning companion has let me have bites of all the various dishes he's ordered - shrimp, fish, pork, tofu -  and all of that has been delicious too! Enjoy!",

The food takes on the flavor of their containers a little, which is generally unpleasant. The last time I visited, we ate at the restaurant. It was definitely better than the take out. They have build your own stir fry bowls, which are a good value ( I ended up with 3-4 servings of food). I had tons of veggies and beef in a kung pao sauce and asked for it extra spicy. The spice level was minimal. The flavor was a bit bland. The positive was that the portion was huge and the veggies were fresh. I'll probably still come to Mu Shu when I'm feeling lazy (it's less than a mile from home), but it definitely isn't my first choice in the downtown area.",

The portion was HUGE once it was all prepared.   We came on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. The owner chatted us up and seemed like a really nice guy... Answered all our questions.   My wife got the Mu Shu Wrap and it was really big and super tasty. (She let me have a bite.) We also shared some wonton soup that was made on the spot   with fresh stock and spinach off the stir fry bar. It was great!  Overall I really enjoyed this place. It's not upscale but it is a really fresh tasty alternative to traditional Chinese or greasy fast food.   The owner says they get a big lunch rush during the week but they have plenty of seating and I think they'd be able to accommodate groups. I had a really good experience! Totally worth a visit to try!",

And the stirfry counter lets you LOAD up as much as you can, then pick your protein and sauce. The owner came over and chatted with me, which is an A++ in my book, I love family owned joints. If I'm ever in the Phoenix area again I'll be sure to check in. Enjoy!!",

The floors were not sticky, clean tables, and most importantly, clean restrooms.  They pretty much have plenty of options to choose from. You can create your own stir fry. We ordered the medium size hot and sour soup, chicken spring roll, and spicy Schezwan chicken. The soup came in a big bowl (size of a ramen noodle bowl) with crispys. The soup was hot, fresh, and mild. Perfectly cooked with bamboo, tofu, mushroom, and meat. Next,the Schezwan chicken was okay. Too much greens which kinda lowered the rich taste of Schezwan pepper. Lastly, the rolls, the filling inside was good. However, the wonton cover wasn't cooked properly. It was raw.  We highlighted the issue with the roll to the server, and she apologized. We declined for a replacement and she didn't charge for the item. Appreciate when restaurant accept their shortcomings! Thank you to her.  All in all, the experience was above average except for the rolls. Would recommend and definitely go back to try some of the other items, possibly stir fry next time.",

    "text": "Well, it was worth a try. I wanted to start the meal with a cup of egg-drop soup. My experience with other Chinese restaurants is that  usually your choice is a cup, a bowl, or a big bowl for family style. Here, \"cup\" and \"small\" are two different sizes and not realizing that, I said \"small\" and got a bowl bigger (and more expensive) than I had expected. Fine ... my fault for not paying attention to the details in the menu listing. I also ordered mapo tofu, one of my favorite Chinese dishes. The tofu dish that I got had an OK taste but it tasted more like soy sauce tofu, nothing spectacular. Mapo tofu it was not, as it did not have  the kick of Sichuan peppercorns and hot chili oil, the two main heat elements of real mapo tofu.  Also, spicy fermented bean paste (dou ban jiang) is the main umami element of mapo tofu; I did see a few small bean cotyledons in the sauce, but the flavor of fermented bean paste was hardly discernible. As I said, the taste of the dish was OK and the portion was decent, but mapo tofu it was not. At 19 bucks and change for the tofu dish, a small bowl of egg drop soup, and a bottled water, the meal was surprisingly pricey.",

So this Chinese comforts food, is decent, but then again, probably not incredible healthy. They are family friendly, and food is out and ready quite quickly, not a huge variety of adult beverages, but enough to find something for everyone.  I just have to share my experience, my son learns mandarin as part of his school curriculum, and he was hesitant to ask our waitress if she could speak mandarin, we encourage him to ask. He exchanged a few phrases with her, and they understood each other, it was so touching. And she even taught him how to order his food in mandarin. We had noodles and sweet and sour chicken with veggies, and it was enough to leave us satisfied.  We will definitely be back!",

They have traditional Chinese/Asian entrees but they also have combinations that you would normally only find during lunch at other Chinese restaurants.  I couldn't resist the Mongolian beef and lemon chicken combination.  I couldn't believe how big the portion was.  It also came with choice of soup, spring roll and choice of rice.  Wow!

Given the deliciousness of this godly plum sauce I always ask for extra, however I rarely receive any extra.  I understand that they obviously value the plum sauce as much as I do hence why they hand it out so sparingly.  Any who, I will continue to visit Mu Shu and take part in the battle over the plum sauce.  The burrito warrants it.  Till next time Mu Shu! Please god grant me more plum sauce next time!",

Take your choice of chicken, shrimp, and whatever else they have... choices of sauce (go for the spicy garlic), and noodles, white or brown rice.  Then grab a bowl and stuff in as many veggies as you can.  The veggie bar is immaculate, and you can tell they use the freshest ingredients: onions, broccoli, bean sprouts, watercress, kale, tofu, green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and probably 5 others I got.  I usually go with chicken, light spicy garlic sauce, and white rice.  It runs me about $7, and I end up saving half of it for a second meal.  The take-out service is super quick, and the staff couldn't be friendly.  It only took two take-outs to become a regular.  Be sure to ask for a stir-fry card (I believe its 11th one free), as you will be using it!",

I ordered shrimp fried rice, lobster in black bean garlic sauce, pot stickers and my wife ordered the peking beef.  The food arrived and as soon as I saw the lobster I knew we had a problem.  The plate itself looked messy and unappealing.  The lobster was way overcooked and hard, I did not consume half of the dish.  The taste was very lacking and the sauce was very bland.  The shrimp fry rice was basic with peas and carrots in the dish.  The pot stickers were delicious.  The peking beef was okay.  Needless to say I will not be returning to this place and would not recommend it to anyone else. I did communicate my dislike to someone who looked like the owner or manager.",

    "text": "For years I drove past this place... and a good analogy would be don't judge a book by it's cover, or a restaurant by the bus stop in front of it. When I finally did stop in for dinner I kicked myself for not visiting sooner. The Ong's are amazing people and are always really welcoming and nice. They even ask about my daughter if I don't have her with me... and it's not like I'm in every day. You open the door to a happy cat giving the high five and it only gets better. This place is clean, clean, clean. You could eat off the floor clean. Yes, Asian food can be high in calories, and if you are one of those people that count them, then this is the place for you. They have the freshest vegetables for stir fry (the buffet is always beautiful) and they can stir them up healthy and low cal for you in a jiffy. Or if you are old school you can kick it fried with a sweet and sour sauce. It is the best of both worlds and they have something for everyone, even a kids menu. My daughter loves the honey chicken with white rice. And I swear, the most expensive thing on the menu is the lobster and at $15 dollars... well, need I say more. Most lunch items are $6.95 and they pop it up to $7.95 for dinner. It is almost crowded at lunch and all sorts of smart people can be found eating there. Dinner is a little quieter, but on a third or fourth date this spot can be a great place to eat and converse and it won't dent your wallet. No one rushing you out and it's quiet in a nice way. They also serve beer and wine (happy hour is 4 to 7) and they have a soda fountain so you can help yourself or the server will top you off... especially at dinner when it isn't as crowded. This is really a mom and pop place and they take pride in all they do. If you are looking for hip/franchise (drive) move along. This is a one of a kind place with regulars. My favorite dish is their Mu Shu wrap which includes all the yummy deliciousness of the traditional Chinese dish wrapped in a tasty tortilla. I'm pretty sure this is the only place that has a Chinese/burrito and it is fantastic (I can barely finish half of it.) My only complaint could be that the servings are huge or to put it nicely very, very generous. It is all a part of the awesome hospitality of the place so I don't hold it against them, but you won't be able to leave without a take out bag (because you wouldn't want to hurt Mr. Ong's feelings.) Take out is quick, their food is great for the price, and if you happen to be a bus rider the nearest bus stop is only a few steps away. They have a web site with coupons sometimes, so check them out on-line before you go. So uo de kuai le!",

The flavors are so unique and satisfying that i wish i could finish two.",

However, the bowl was neverending. I ate. And I ate. And I ate some more, with no dent being made in the bowl. So needless to say, you'll definitely get your money's worth. I just have to pick a different sauce the next time around.  Cheap, quick, and easy (I'm talking about the restaurant, people, get your minds out of the gutter).",

Its buffet style when it comes to this, you just grab a bowl, fill it up with whatever fresh vegetables you want and hand it over. They take it and throw it in a Wok with the other choices you've made. For me, its usually hit or miss. When I go close together, I remember what tasted great or egh the time before.   This time I chose shrimp as my meat. I got 5 shrimp in my bowl :( I won't be getting that next time. I also chose the spicy garlic sauce which wasn't that spicy to me. The dish was huge and could easily serve two.  The spring rolls are good, the crab angels are okay, they have this taste that just doesn't taste right to me.  All in all, its just okay.

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that for the past 2 years I have lived in Boston, which has some decent Chinese restaurants, great food, but rude/curt/abrupt service. I had learned to keep my head down, not make eye contact and not ask any questions. Eat as fast as possible and get the hell out before someone starts yelling at you!  So understandably my guard was up when I entered Mu Shu Asian Grill. However, complete opposite here. Mr Mu Shu welcomed me to his establishment, asked me if I had ever been here before and took the time to explain the stir fry/salad bar station.  I was in the mood for Mu Shu, and a place named Mu Shu must have great Mu Shu, right? Mr MS described to me his version of MS, I heard him say something about a burrito, but I really wasn't paying too much attention as I smugly thought I knew everything there was to know about Mu Shu! Boy was I wrong! When I get it, it's bigger than my forearm. It's packed full of shrimp, veggies and fried rice. Wow, what a great flavour!  You've heard of Asian fusion? This is Mexasian!",

    "text": "I have been coming here 1-2 times per month for the past year now for their stir-fry. They have a big salad bar of veggies and you fill up a big bowl and then they cook it with your choice of meat or tofu, sauce, and rice or noodles. For only about $10 you get a delicious, huge, healthy meal (for me it is enough for two satisfying meals). I don't even bother making stir-fry anymore. It's awesome!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went in last night at 8:45pm when they close at 9pm.  We asked if it was still alright to get an order to-go.  They were supper welcoming and didn't rush us at all.  All the vegetables for us to build our dish we beautiful and fresh.  While we waited for the food to cook, I got to watch them all work to close-up.  Each person paid attention to the details and they didn't take any short cuts.  This place was spotless clean. Finally, the food was amazing!  I got the veg stir-fry with Kung pao and noodles. My man had beef and pork with spicy garlic and fried rice.  Plenty left-overs.  Look forward to many more visits.",

    "text": "We loved Mu Shu! I got the stir fry with tofu. You get an enormous bowl to fill with vegetables and pick your sauce and rice/noodles. There was an ample selection of veggies and they all appeared fresh. Our stir fries were ready in just a couple minutes. Overall the portions are very generous. The tofu was the silken kind. The best part about our meal was the service! All of the people working there were incredibly nice and friendly and made us feel so welcome. They explained to us what to do and made sure we got exactly what we wanted. Their smiling faces and kindness made our night!",
