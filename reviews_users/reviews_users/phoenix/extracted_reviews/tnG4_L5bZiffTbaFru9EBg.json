    "text": "I love Lebanese food and this is a very good place!  I ordered the Chicken Kebab plate with Tabouli and all was delicious.  The chicken came out in large chunks and was moist and very tasty, seasoned perfectly. It was charred slightly and juicy inside.  The rice was perfect too.  It was cooked to perfection (light and fluffy) and seasoned slightly with Turmeric which was wonderful.  The tabouli was spot on and did not have to much bulgur wheat in it.  It was a huge portion and loaded with all the right ingredients.  The staff here are very friendly and make sure you enjoy your experience and it shows due to the Yelp reviews!  Check them out if your are in the mood for great Lebanese food, or just want to give it a try for the first time, you'll love it!",

I was surprised to find this place as a store and restaurant. But the biggest shocker was the food. OMG was it ever phenomenal. I got the Kabob combo, comes with chicken, beef and Kofta, rice, hummus and salad....all for only $13. The beef blew me away because it was so full of flavor and tender as a filet. I'm happy to put this on one of my all time favorites. Don't let the location or store deter you from experiencing an amazing meal. The staff was very friendly and service was good as well.

Got there and sat down anywhere, waiter came over to us and gave us menus quick, took or drink order and returned within 5 minutes. I order the chicken shawarma pita combo with fries and a drink, my girlfriend got the salmon plate. It took a little longer than I expected to get our food. Once the food came out, it was very good. Fries had a great seasoning on them and crispy, personally how I like them. The pita was very good with added taziki sauce. The salmon was a large plate with salad, rice, and another small bowl of something didn't know what it was but it was good. Total was only $22 and we were both full and happy. On our way out we noticed that the waiter was also behind the kitchen doing multiple things. Overall very good and after the first thought of, what is this going to be like, we will be going back.",

We ordered two sides of pita bread which ended up being two pieces of pita bread cut into 8 and covered in foil. Next we also ordered hummus which is stated to come with pita bread which it did not. Then my \"gyro entree\" came with rice, meat and hummus but no pita bread. Honestly pita bread is one of the cheapest things to make next to rice. What they saved in pita bread will cost them in customers. Don't waste your time here.",

    "text": "Completely love everything about Princess Mediterranean Market & Deli from their dine in options to the baklava/namura desserts to take home from the deli area. The lamb shank, falafel, and kabobs were all great meal options. Fortunately our table of 4 got a little bit of everything so we could taste a collection of options offered by Princess. Each platter also came with some very good quality hummus. Their baklava came in 3 varieties in three distinct shapes: pistachio, walnut, and cashew. At $1/piece or $9.99/lb (minimum 12 pieces), I took home a little bit of everything. When I say \"take home,\" I took it all the way back to the Bay Area since I've never seen cashew baklava before. The pistachio baklava seemed the sweetest so I guess it just depends on your personal preference which one to get. When in doubt, just get them all like I did. I don't know how to explain what the namura was exactly like ($1 each or $6.99/lb), but it was a soft slightly sweet pastry with a little bit of coconut flakes inside. I liked the baklava better but the namura was definitely homemade and very unique. Since I've never had namura a before, it's hard to say exactly where it ranks within the namura ladder of quality. All the workers here are very kind and nice people. I will be returning next time I'm in Mesa.",

The Arabic salad is superb, hummus was good, rice got its color from turmeric instead of saffron.  Other people at the table had the beef kabob combo, and the chicken shawarma.   OMG!  the garlic yogurt sauce was so delicious, I think it only comes with the chicken shawarma.  I can just drink it up  Desserts are $1 each, bite size.

The pita and hummus were fresh and tasted delicious as well. The gyro was well cooked with tons of yummy flavors and was so fresh. Maybe I will start trusting my boyfriend more ;)",

The desserts are great too! I would highly recommended it, even if its not your usual place just give it a try. It for sure wasn't my usual place but thanks to my roommate I tried it and now love it.

    "text": "Princess Mediterranean Market offers food fit for a princess (Or a group of 6 hungry food adventurers)! I had a lovely evening with some super cool buddies including the awesome Hieyam A. and Grace O. The setup is similar to Haji Baba in that half the business is a market while the other half has a sit down restaurant.  We started with the kibbe as an appetizer. It was a little different than other versions of kibbe I've had in the past but still quite good. Instead of a cube or rectangle of bulgur wheat and beef mixed together, this was more like a samosa with bulgur wheat outer crust with beef inside. It was fried to a light crisp and I enjoyed the flavors and the different textures. I had the veggie combo as an entree which included tabbouli, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, and grape leaves, served with pita bread. My favorites in the combo were the falafel and the hummus. The hummus was so smooth and creamy with a perfect melding of flavors. The falafel was excellent as well, lightly crispy on the outside, tender soft filling, and a wonderfully balanced blend of seasoning and spice. The tabbouli was the only element I wasn't as thrilled about since it had too much lemon juice for my tastes, but I did also enjoy the baba ganoush which had a smooth light texture and smoked flavor. The grape leaves were decent.   We finished our meal with some delectable baklava. I usually find baklava a little too sweet, or too dry but the ones we had were a nice balance of flakiness and sweetness. We shared a little bit of each type they had: the pistachio, cashew, and walnut.   Service was superb and our server was friendly and sweet.  The restaurant closes a little early (8 PM, 7 PM on Sunday) so I do wish they were open a little later but the market is open until 9 PM most days.  The meals we had were very reasonably priced. Mine was $8 and it was a hefty portion that left me pleasantly full afterwards.  Thanks for a great meal. I will definitely be back for more delicious dishes and to check out the market. I especially want to go back to try the Friday afternoon buffet!  4.5/5.",

The restaurant takes up about a third of the space with 8 booths and about 9 scattered tables.   A pleasant young woman greeted us and invited us to sit anywhere. Arabic music played overhead at a reasonable volume, easy to hear but not interfere with conversation. The place was very clean and open.   We had hummus with chicken shawarma, lentil soup, Arabic salad, and Kafta. Everything was fresh and delicious. Prices are excellent.   I finished with Turkish coffee served in a small copper urn with a tiny cup and saucer. Very good.",

We were greeted when we walked in and every single one of the staff members was really friendly the entire time we were there.  For dinner I got the chicken shawarma entree which is typically what I get at Mediterranean restaurants. The cost for the plate was $9 which included the chicken shawarma, garlic dipping sauce, a choice of three side (either garden salad, rice, arabic salad, hummus, baba ghannouge, tabouleh, or fries), and also pita bread. I chose the garden salad, rice, and hummus. My date got the gyro entree ($8) that came with tzatziki and chose the arabic salad, rice, and hummus.  We both really liked the hummus with pita bread, the rice, and thought both the salads were really good too. I was unable to eat the whole plate of food, but my date helped me out. The price was definitely really fair for what we got. I meant to grab baklava, but forgot. It was only $1 for a piece though ... We'll be back!",

The hummus is fairly high in tahini and it is very creamy. The salad and dressing were crisp with no sign of spoilage in the lettuce. The tabbouleh was good but was probably much better earlier in the day. The pita was the weakest item I had but I don't eat much bread so that was fine.   Prices were very reasonable. I marked them down one star for the pita and slightly wilting tabbouleh but I would definitely go again.",

I always order the chicken shawarma plate, and have never been disappointed. They use high quality cuts of chicken for the shawarma which is much appreciated! No grisly fat pieces to ruin your plate. Ordering ahead of time via Yelp is also great, but it turns out the pricing is a little higher if you order through Yelp rather than calling the restaurant directly.  We also have used Princess for large catering orders here in the office. In the past, you had to contact the restaurant directly to complete a catering order, which wasn't the most organized, but they have since started catering through EZ-Cater which is awesome and allows for online catering orders.",

    "text": "First time customer. I have driven past for many years, and I have to admit, I've been missing out.   I just grabbed a gyro for lunch, and I must say, this is one delicious gyro. I'd definitely put this one in a tie for the top 3 I've had. I've been to various places around the valley, my ex-wife was greek, and you may think a gyro is a gyro is a gyro, but that's not True.   I won't say that other places \"disappointed\" me, but there was nothing special about them. This gyro, that I'm actually eating while typing this, is a gyro done well and done right.   The flavor profile is great, all of the ingredients really shine together and the taste comes alive in your mouth.  As I said, first time here, haven't tried anything else so I can't speak on that, but if you want a gyro, a good gyro, one where you won't just be like, \"well, it was good but blah, nothing special\", get a gyro here.  If the other food is at the same level as this gyro, and I have no reason to think otherwise, this place is a real gem.  Don't make the same mistake I have done and keep driving by, make an intentional effort to stop in, and you will not be disappointed.  My compliments to the chef.",

This is a very nice Mediterranean little market, they even sell huge bottles of avocado oil for $10! The cheapest I could ever find before this has been $20, so I'm pretty excited about that!   The deli is great!! The Gyro meat is thicker cut and not dry at all (and it didn't give me heartburn, woo hoo!) I brought a friend and she just loved her gyro wrap. The hummus is fresh, homemade tasting, served with a nice drizzle of olive oil on top.... Mmmm super good...   Service is super friendly and helpful. I'm so glad to have found this little gem!

They're generous with the Kalamata Olives :) The grilled chicken is amazing...as well as the Shawarma, both beef and chicken. You will have to just let your taste buds experience them. Finally, the Baklava....!!!!  Drumroll please!  Not only do they offer this wonderful treat - but they actually have 3, yes 3 kinds of it! One is even a Lady Finger Style, they are all delish. To top it all, the service is very warm and friendly. Come check them out and bring a friend or two, amazing specials each week.",

This was honestly the best Mediterranean food I've had and it's such a great deal. I ordered a vegetarian play that came with falafel, hummus, tabouleh and baba ganoush. I've never been a big fan of tabouleh but I absolutely loved theirs! And the baklava/other pastries are also amazing. If I'm ever back in Tempe, I will definitely be eating here again.",

    "text": "It's about time i got this review posted considering I have been eating lunch here at least once a week since I was told how close to work this was.  The food here is really good and fresh. I am a huge fan of middle eastern cuisine and I was surprised they had one of my favorites, kafta, on the menu. The kofta here is great it gets a nice light char from the grill on the outside but is still juicy and tender on the inside. I love it. The fact that the platter is only $8 and comes with rice, hummus and salad is a deal I can't pass up.  Those who know me know that I am picky on what hummus I enjoy since i have been making my own for almost 20 years. The hummus here is the rare exception to my normal rule that I don't like the super smooth and creamy hummus. I am not sure what exactly it is but I like it here.  For lunch I usually get the tabouli instead of the salad as my second side. It's really fresh and has a nice bite to it. I usually mix it with some hummus and apply to pita bread as the flavors work well together.  As for other things on the menu I have sampled most of their range of baklava thanks to the great yelp check in deal they had. I really liked the walnut but usually I will just look into the case and point at whatever looks good. That plan hasn't left me disappointed yet so I think I will stick with it. For entree's the chicken shwarma is my second favorite, the garlic sauce really makes this dish; the beef shawarma is pretty tasty but I have a hard time passing over the chicken for this one.  The staff is friendly and I can't find a negative thing to say about this place. Check it out and you will be happy you did.",

The fact that plates come with a choice of three sides. The market had a very wide variety of interesting things I want to try. I even enjoyed the music. But the best was the sweat Mexican waitress who made sure everything was perfect. Very impressive first experience.",

Given the chaos of taking orders for 12 people, each with an individual check, our waitress gets an A+ for being able to handle everything so well.    I ordered the gyro, which was so yummy and the perfect amount of food. The platters that everyone else ordered looked so good, and the portions were definitely on the larger side. We also ordered sides of hummus with pita bread, and the hummus was so creamy and definitely something you have to order when coming here. The only con was waiting for the food...it took almost 40 minutes for the food to come out. I thought the wait was pretty long but I also understand that they wanted to bring out all our food around the same time.   The little market next to the restaurant carries a lot of speciality items and could definitely be a fun place to peruse while waiting for your food. The pricing of our food was amazing...cannot be beat! For the price and the portions, we'll definitely be back.",

I ordered the gyro plate- came with a substantial amount of meat, tzaztki sauce, basmati rice, hummus, salad, and pita bread. While I had a large amount of gyro meat, it was more on the dry side. Would have preferred for it to be a little less dry. Everything else on the plate was delicious! The hummus and the rice were the stars of my lunch. Hummus was creamy and well seasoned. Rice was nice and fluffy, the cucumber salad was excellent as well.  Overall- I would love to try this place out again. The meat was dry, but definitely not inedible as I ate the whole damn thing!

There's nothing more motivating for me to go grocery shopping than delicious food that reminds me of home.   The grocery market has everything someone from the middle east might need - bread, drinks, chocolates, spices, clothes etc. Nothing breaks the bank or makes the wallet cry.   The chicken shawarma and the falafel sandwich here are the best I've ever had in Arizona. I'd been on a quest to find a shawarma that tasted close to the mouth-watering ones I used to feast on in the UAE as a child. I'd met my match. It was love at first bite. The shawarma wasn't too runny and it had the right amount of meat and sauces and other fillings. The bread was actual arabic bread and not pita break (never acceptable). The falafel was prepared to perfection.   I promise you that you will not be disappointed!!",

As soon as I walked into the Deli the smells of food surrounded my senses. So I put the shopping on hold as I realized that there was dining. Our hostess was Hyatt. She helped us with selection suggestions. A beautiful array of food was served on a large platter. The variety of the food was amazing. I am a bit of a snob when it comes to my hummus. I am a traveler so I have had hummus from coast to coast and everything in between. The hummus here was the best I have ever had. After going a bit over board on all the deliciousness I thought I was full. Then Hyatt suggested her favorite dessert. Which was a special order and favorite of Hyatts. So we relaxed and sipped tea until it came out of the oven. Again I ate in amazement of even more outstanding food. Hyatt is a wonderful person. She is the perfect hostess. The Princess Restaurant and Deli is my new favorite restaurant. Come find out for yourself.",

They have the space kind of split down the middle with a wall between the grocery store part and kitchen and the sit down area and there's a walk way area where the two intersect. The restaurant side has dimmer lighting, decor and nicer walls. The grocery/take out side is more brightly lit and not decorated. I always come here and order a falafel sandwich to go and it's so so good! They have really friendly staff and are nice about substitutions if you don't like something on a combo platter. Super easy to order vegan here, the falafel sandwich, veggie combo, lentil soup and of course fries are my go to's. They also have yummy olives and in the grocery store they have nut mixes and dates by the lb. Very reasonable prices and authentic food. Mediterranean food is one of my favorite cuisines and this is my favorite spot in the Phoenix area to get mediterranean food. Growing up my mom used to get sheets of baklava here for parties and occasions. I still come here to this day.",

    "text": "Princess Mediterranean is both a middle eastern grocery and a restaurant.  This review is for the restaurant, but the grocery is not bad either.  The menu at Princess is just about what you would expect for the genre - kabobs, shwarma, falafel, served in plates with rice, houmous, and salad, or in wraps.  They also have the usual appetizers.  But the food is well above average - mainly.  The chicken shwarma is tasty and free of odd pieces of skin or cartilage; the rice is also tasty and fluffy.  But the houmous was bland and totally lacked lemon.  The Arabian (chopped) salad made up for that, however, being so overwhelmingly lemony that it was hard to eat.  But if you mixed the two, it was perfect.  My wife liked her falafel wrap, and I thought the Kibbee appetizer was far better than what I have come to expect.  The Princess is clean, bright, and in good repair (well -- not quite perfect; our booth had torn vinyl).  The service is fine, and the prices are really quite low.  Most plates are around $10, and the wraps around $5.  This could well be a regular for me if only it were closer to my normal haunts.",

When my sons come home from college with their huge appetites, they want at least one meal from Princess Market.  I often call them to cater events.  They offer dine-in, take-out and delivery.  We live close by and enjoy walking here and eating in.  Our favorite meals are grilled chicken, chicken shawarma plates and the gyros plate or salad.  It's fun to browse and shop while waiting, and they're always friendly.  The owners are really good people.  Food is healthy, fresh, carefully-made and always delicious.  You can't beat the prices, either!  Hands-down, our favorite local restaurant.",

    "text": "I feel that the reviews on here are overrated. \"Best falafel in town\" my *ss!   First, let's talk food. I'm not new to Mediterranean food. However, this was my first attempt at eating falafel. Here it's horrible. Tasteless even with the sauce. Burnt on the edges. I have since had falafel elsewhere convinced it was good because I understand the Greeks and Hebrews eat it like popcorn and I have found places with great falafel, just not here as the other rave reviews would suggest. BUT they have great Adas soup. It was really spicy in a good way and nice and creamy. So I can't explain the falafel failure. Overpriced for what you get. I had to eat off my husband's plate to get full. They do bring OK pita bread out to you.   As far as atmosphere goes, it's lacking a bit. This place is (as somebody wrote) 2/3 market, 1/3 restaurant. They have a sign in the window that says \"Allah\" and \"Mohammed\", which I don't think is a good idea. There is definitely NOT outdoor seating as the stats indicate. The tables are the cheap fold-up kind and so are the chairs. The tables are chipped. The waiters serve in a timely manner but don't smile like they would at a chain. They do have a big screen TV that was playing a soccer game but at least the volume was low.   I can't recommend this place for a date or for families. It's just mediocre.",

Anyway, I had chicken shawarma sandwich it was only $3.99 and I would say a really great value. To me it's better than the beef shawarma. It always tastes goooood. I often have it with garlic paste.

I think they could improve their portions however. Prices are decent. The lamb kabob was good! Their fries are good. The pistachio baklava is good. Pay at the register.",

    "text": "After following this place on Instagram and drooling over falafel pics I decided to finally make the trip to Mesa to Princess Mediterranean Market. I am sure glad I did! This place was a little tough to find, you can't see it from the street and Google maps definitely steered me wrong haha. But it wasn't too bad! It almost seems like a gas station type place when you walk in, there was like no one there when we went! The little market area seemed cool and I hope to go back to pick out some new ingredients to try! The restaurant part was nice! Empty on a Friday night. We were helped right away. There was a lot of options on the menu, good vegetarian ones too! And the best part was that prices are low. Very few places you can go and get great authentic food for such reasonable prices. For my meal I ended up getting the falafel entree with rice, pita, hummus, and Arabic(I think?) salad. They have good options for sides too! The falafel was some of the best falafel I've had. The spices were perfect and it was nice and crunchy without being too dry or too oily. The hummus was delicious as well. The salad part was surprisingly awesome as well, it was a simple salad, but it was very good with all of the other food on my plate. It was a lot of food for $8 and kept me full for sure! I look forward to coming back and getting more tasty falafel.",

Princess Market knows how to do falafel just right.  Not too dark.  Inside still moist.  Perfect balance of seasoning.  Dollop of hummus, lettuce, tomato. And don't get me started on those special little pickles.  I didn't even know until a couple of years ago that they were supposed to even be there!  Lovely.  So run, do not walk, to Princess Market for all the middle eastern treats you crave.  Whether it's stocked on their shelves or served up in the cafe, you will not be disappointed.  And by all means, don't forget your smoked herring from good old Brooklyn, NY.  Bonus!",

I love how they left us alone to talk and didn't rush us out the door. (but they did refill the water and pick up the plates). The gyro plate was good. Not the best I've had, the slices were really thin and not very juicy. The hummus was nice and my friend really enjoyed the falafel.

I was a vegan at the time I visited, and had no problem stuffing my face with loads of hummus and rice on naan, with a bit of Sriracha hot sauce and loads of the pre-dressed salad. I think the meat is usually lamb (perhaps chicken, as well). Both times I've gone, my companions have been disappointed in this meat. One said it was too dry, the other that it lacked the proper seasoning (my dad's big on seasonings). I'd believe it, but I'd still go back.",

There were two people who ran the store and they barely spoke a word. Despite being quiet, they were polite and friendly. There was plenty of room to sit with many tables. I would not recommend this place for those who are not familiar with Middle Eastern cuisine as this is not really a \"date\" place.

Said he noticed I had no drink for my order so he stopped to get me one as an apology. Huh? So by all means make yourself later by STOPPING to get something from another restaurant that I didn't order from... c'mon.    Now onto the not so hot food. The spinach pie will not be ordered again due to being mostly dough and a small scoop of spinach in the center, and it just wasn't tasty. Rather blah. The Kibbi is okay. Might order again (if we order from here again). The beef sambusas, same. Okay but the dipping sauce is the star of this appetizer. As for the Chicken duo entree and side of beef kofta,  they were done well enough; however, the chicken on the kabob had that gummy frozen chicken texture (total turn-off for me) so that will never be ordered again. Rice, shawarma, and kofta were good. Wish there were roasted tomatoes and grilled onions. Really would've saved the food experience a lil bit.",

My only complaint would be the garlic sauce is almost too intense, but it might just be my weak self. We also had the most incredible server. She was so nice and caring and genuinely talked to us.

I tried the gyro deluxe sandwich, the 6 piece falafel plate, and the pistacchio baklava (as recommended by another Yelper in the comments section), and I was not disappointed. The food is just outright delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked, the falafel was amazing, and the baklava just melts inside the mouth. I don't know why I haven't tried out this place before! I will definitely be back to try some other items on their menu. They close pretty early in the evening though (last call for food is around 8:00 PM is what they told me), otherwise I would've planned on dining-in sometime. However, I would definitely recommend this place if you enjoy Mediterranean food (I haven't met anyone who doesn't) :-)",

    "text": "My hubby and I just went New Year's eve for lunch, since we were in the area. The place is kind of a dive, I did not expect this by the ppl who have told me about it. It is part of a very small convenience Mediterranean market. The 2 girls working there seemed very young, and when I ordered I asked for Baba ganoosh to start with, which is in their appetizer section and she only brought it with the meal.  She was on her phone and didn't seem like she was paying attention to us or the other two ppl in the dining area. Then I ordered the Princess plate for us to share and my hubby also got the gyro wrap.  After about 30 min, all food arrived and that's when they offered refills on water. He said his gyro was good enough but not the best, his fries were actually very good and lightly seasoned which we really enjoyed.   $29 Princess Plate incl w/my estimates of amt.  1/2 c. Chicken shawarma- I didn't like at all, hard and plain. My hubby said he liked it, but he didn't eat much. 1/3 C. Beef shawarma- more tender, mild flavor.  1 Chicken kabab(5pcs meat) - didn't seem fully cooked inside, weird lightly seasoned. 1 beef Kabab(5pcs meat) - very good and tender, a little too charred on parts but delicious. 1 beef kofta kabab- very good, nice flavor, cooked medium well.  Salad was basic but good and Italian dressing was good also.  Hummus- typical hummus but good. Rice was pretty good, reminded me of rice a roni flavor.  This plate was very expensive considering the amts were small.   Baba Ghannouge- probably best I've had, big pieces of eggplant, well seasoned. A tad bitter, still excellent. Pita bread was good, but basic.  We got the walnut baklava and supposedly pistachio to share.  Very small piece each, the pistachio? was not pistachio, I don't know what it was, it just seemed like dough to us. Neither were good, tasted like margarine and corn syrup. Yuck.    Considering the lack of cleaning, lack of service, and quality of most food , we won't be back. Unless I get hubby to only pick up baba g and beef kabab on his way home. It makes me very sad, I grew up on this food from friends and cousins and can't find any restaurants that are nearly as delicious.",

    "text": "I heard about Princess and their good reviews for a couple of years.  Finally tried it with a friend Aug 1, 2017.  I love lamb and ordered the lamb shank for $12.  It comes dry (they said they steam it) with no sauce.  I wanted a bowl of juice or gravy, for which they did not tell me, costs 50 cents extra.  I later saw on my bill, after I got home and looked at my bill to reference it for this review.  My friend said her Greek salad did not have enough dressing and wanted more salad dressing.   When I got  home, I found another extra charge for the small container of dressing on my bill, too, another 50 cents.  I wish they would tell me first, that our request costs 50 cents each, so we could make a choice.  I did not  think to look at the details of the bill before I paid it.  So I took off one star for not being informed about the extra charges.  My server Emily did tell me there is extra charge for MORE lamb juices when I was leaving and asked if I could have more juice to take home to eat with my leftovers, but I thought the charge was for a second request for more juice,   I turned the gravy that costs, down.  At that time, I didn't know I was charged for even my first request for salad dressing and lamb gravy.  She did not tell us of extra charge for the small container of extra salad dressing when we asked for it and when she brought it to our table.  I eat out several times a week, and do not recall ever being charged in my long life (I am a senior) for more salad dressing when you feel there is not enough on your salad in the first place.  They just bring you more.  My friend did love her Greek salad though, said it did not wilt when she had the leftovers the next day, but that is because she did not add the extra dressing when she boxed it to go at the restaurant.    I liked my lamb shank but it was not any different from other restaurants lamb shank i had at Habbouz Tunisian, Persian Room, Haji Baba, Mijana and other Mediterranean places.  Without the gravy side, it would have been quite boring and dry.  I take the meat off the bone and mash into the juices, and that is what made it delicious. So I would pay 50 cents in the future for the juices on the side (no juice or sauce is included with your entree, just a dry lamb shank), but I didn't appreciate not being told that a first request incurs a charge, which I think was the fault of the man at the counter where I placed my order.    We also tried both the beef and chicken shawarma, but as expected, the chicken was very hard and dry and even the beef was very dry.  That is why I never order chicken when I go out to eat, most places cook it like formed sawdust.  Only Khyber Halal did a marvelous job of grilling chicken cubes, so tender and moist and charbroiled flavor.  So the second star deduction is for the hard and dry chicken and beef shawarmas.    The hummus and baba ganoush was really good 8 of 10 stars, but for lamb shank, I think the best lamb shank is the box of 2 I buy from Costco, because it COMES already soaked in DELICIOUS gravy.      I give our server, blond lady named Emily 4 stars, because she came 2 times to check if we needed anything more, but I woulda given her 5 stars if she disclosed that the extra salad dressing would be another 50 cents added to our bill, which again I only discovered when I am looking at my check from 4 days ago, to write this review.  Interior atmosphere was too dark for my liking, even by the window, and my booth seat had a long rip in it, not taped, but I sat anyhow, in more to avoid the rip.    I might come back here to try the baklava and gyros, since several of my Yelp Eliter Friends raved about those items.  My friend wants to order the lamb shank.",

The gyro meat was seasoned well and very tender, and the tzatziki sauce was perfect.  The greek salad was fresh and the dressing was tangy and delicious.  They didn't skimp on the kalamata olives or feta, either.  My husband had the beef shawarma, and said it was tender and well flavored.  The baklava was melt-in-your-mouth good, and they have several different flavors, not just your standard walnut.  We had the pistachio.    We are going for round two tonight!",

But here they manage to make it moist and all of the kebabs have a perfect smoky char. The rice is delicious, the mediterranean salad (mix of small-diced tomatoes, onion, I think cucumber, etc. in a light dressing with herbs) is perfect with it. Their baba ghanoush is my favorite I've ever had, fresh and slightly smoky.  It's a relatively small seating area, around 15 tables and booths, in the same space as a middle eastern market, so don't expect glamor. But that's not why you come to a place like this. When I want kebabs, this is the place I think to pay a visit.",

The gyros meat was dry and overcooked, the hummus was blah, the cucumber salad was pretty good, the rice was flavorless, and the pita was thin and chewy. In all fairness, it could have been the delivery time that changed everything from excellent to not-so-much, but I doubt it. Pretty much all of the Mediterranean food I've had to date was better than this. :(",

    "text": "Like many people who work or live in the western part of Mesa near the 101 I have driven by this place 2-4 times a day for the past 13 years.  I don't want to add up how many times that is but 2000 might be reasonable. I have to admit that the location is a bit weird, its a strange little mall tucked away from the street.  The sign has letters I don't understand.    I went there because one of my techs was called to work on one of their refrigerated cases and told me how nice it was.   I went in there and did not tell them anything about my guys working there.  They were so incredibly nice and helpful I could not believe it.  When I told them that is was my first time there they patiently explained everything on the menu to me and even brought me samples of some items I had not had before.    The shwarma is my favorite for the meats (both chicken and beef) but everything I have tried is fresh and flavorful.  Their kabobs use good quality meat that isn't too chewy.  I am a total hummus snob and make my own frequently.  Theirs is made fresh every day and tastes as good as my home made if not better.  In fact my wife bought some at Costco today and it was so bad in comparison that it made me remember I had to give these people a good review.   You can buy the same ingredients in the attached store and if you ask they will tell you which ones are best.   The have great pita bread in the freezer you can warm up and is better than any other pita bread around here.  Their prices in both the restaurant and deli are very reasonable for the quality of the food.  Another reviewer mentioned wiping the tables with the same rag as they wiped the tables.  I have seen multiple restaurants do this and as long as the rag has proper disinfectant I do not see anything wrong with it. In fact -- think about it -- you almost always put your hands down on a booth when  you slide in, then you eat with them!  I am GLAD they wipe down the booths with disinfectant.    I like this place because it is clean, you can see back into the kitchen and see how they keep it.  I don't think giving such a low rating for what seems to be a standard practice is very fair.   Yes, the different tiles in the dining room a a bit weird, but it is only like 1/4\" difference.  The location is a little different as is the layout.  In the first of this review I mentioned I had driven buy it literally thousands of times over the last 13 years. It seemed a little odd and I missed out all that time by not exploring it.  If you don't like exploring a little different cultures go to McDonald's.  These are hard working people who make the best food they know how, make it fresh and are incredibly nice.  They have some very beautiful women working there who are also very nice and helpful.  The whole place is maybe a little different than we are used to in Mesa but if you want interesting and flavorful experience stop there and give them a try.",

The shwarma and salads and hummus to die for and very very reasonable. You can order a 1/2 order of the $5 salads and they are still big! If you like chai tea try the karak their homemade version ! Open from 9 am-8 pm (store open until 9 pm) so you can try breakfast too! AMAZING really! I lived in the Middle East and not often impressed here with this cuisine like at this place. People here too very nice and accommodating and friendly and glad to explain the more unusual menu items. During Ramadan they (early June-July dates change yearly this year June6-July 5) there is a buffet for a break fast from 7:30-8:30 and is $13 just like the 12-3pm weekly Friday lunch buffet.",

    "text": "In honesty, I feel a little bad about only being able to give Princess three stars.  But this is a perfect example of the fact that to be considered a 'good resturant', even if it is a basic resturant and not fine dining, they can't just throw good food at you and expect return business.  Ambiance and service are important pieces of that overall recipe.  So I'll start with the food.  This place serves the best, most authentic Mediterranean and Arabic food I've ever had.  The food is fantastic.  I'd say that's a pretty across-the-board statement... everything I've tried here is good.  The ambiance:  Flat out poor.  It is a combo ethnic grocery store and restaurant, so that is a pretty big handicap to overcome from the outset.  No real separation from the grocery store,  Seating area is crowded even though there is only seating for about 20 total.  The seating is primarily booths (that wobble and aren't bolted down) that look like they are from a 1980's McDonalds.  There are some cafe-style bar-height tables for two scattered about in addition.  During lunch it will get full enough that there will be poeple standing around, eating wherever they can find a bit of space ( a testament to the good food).  Cleanliness of eating area was marginal.  Service:  Only marginally better than the ambiance.  The servers, although they can handle orders in English, they clearly prefer taking orders in Arabic.  They have at most two people working tables, and often one.  The server is also responsible for running the grocery store cash register, so if 3-4 customers try to check out at the same time from the grocery side during lunch, they'll spend the rest of the meal trying to catch up.  You'll likely have to chase them down for anything except ordering the base meal and getting that brought to the table (and that might require proactive nagging as well).  Cost:  Very affordable for the quality of the food ($9-$12/person).  Runs on par with Spices and other Mediterrean places in the area.  Net:  Not a good place for families, groups, or dates.  Great place for foodies that want cheap, good authentic food.",

Most importantly, what you all want to know - the food is *bomb.* I ordered the gyro deluxe with Greek fries and you guys, the flavor is insane - hands down best gyro and Greek fries I've had EVER.   Beyond that, Princess has a nice vibe, and it's really cool how it is a combo market and restaurant. Hyatt was our server and she is wonderful! She has a great personality and her service is seamless.   TLDR; Go here. For real.",

We decided to come here to get their chicken and beef Shawarma plates. On our way to the event we called to place a to go order, by the time we got there we only had to wait five minutes to get our order. The food was warm and delicious. It was the perfect addition for movie night, I ended up getting chicken Shawarma with french fries instead of the usual rice because I had my little doggie Patches with me, he ate the fries and enjoyed every last one of them. The chicken Shwarma also came with hummus and tabuli on it.   Update: 3/12/18   I had the beef kabab sandwich. It was delicious! I switched the tahini sauce with taziki sauce instead. Was a great choice!",

There was a woman working there named Hayatt and never in my life have I connected with a waitress on this level. She was kind, interesting, helpful, and lively. She talked openly with my partner and I and had us both laughing and feeling overall positive. She is quick with bringing out your order and making sure everything is correct and satisfactory. It also wasn't just us that she seemed to connect with but the ladies behind us as well. When she found out it was my birthday she was quickly and bountifully generous and brought me out a free dessert.   I've honestly been a lot of places in my life but I've never met anyone as radiant as her. If I didn't already love the atmosphere and delicious food of this place, I would go just for her service.",

I knew I wanted to order the chicken shawarma wrap since that's my standard when I go to Middle Eastern restaurants.   The sandwich was only $4.50 and it was flavorful, I asked for Sriracha sauce and that added a nice spicy kick to it.

The gryo meat was tender, juicy and well seasoned. I love taziki on any gryo I get and here it was very good, but the meat was so good, I caught myself eating it plain or just a touch of taziki. Pita bread was quartered, which may be off-putting to some yet, for us no biggie at all. Salad, rice and hummus were also very good. The chix combo plate scored a thumbs up too. Shawarma was awesome - cooked just right and plenty of flavor. Kabab flavor was spot on however, just a bit over-cooked.  Finally, we took home 2 pieces of walnut baklava - wow! Sweet and crazy good. Portion was on the small side but, get two per person and enjoy!  Service was fast and friendly as well - we are definitely coming back for more!",

My husband has told me multiple times how good the food is and this past Friday I had our daughters with me as we went to visit him while he got his tattoo. They got hungry so I took them next door to Princess for dinner. We ordered lemonade with saffron and it's to die for! We also ordered the family dinner for 5 people, and it was so delicious! We even had leftovers to take home. It came in two huge platters, a whole roasted chicken, chicken kabab, beef kabab, kofta kabab, chicken and beef shawarma, falafel, hummus, rice, salad, pi bread and rolled grape leaves. All for $60! We also had to add in a pound of the baklava. And our amazing server, Hyatt, was the best. Literally the best service I've ever had at a restaurant. She was so attentive, very knowledgeable about the menu and just had such a great personality. All four of my girls fell in love with her, and gave her hugs on the way out. We will definitely be back, the drive will be worth it! Thank you so much Hyatt!",

The service was awesome...definitely will come back!",

    "text": "We discovered Princess Mediterranean via Groupon, and became devoted fans from our first dinner experience. PM is a combo restaurant-grocery, and there is plenty for everyone to go around.  First, the restaurant. Bring a friend or two and on your first visit try the Princess Combo, which could easily satisfy three hungry diners. It comes with delicious chicken kabab, beef kabab, kofta kabab, chicken shawarma, and beef shawarma -- all of which you can order off the menu, as well. The toughest part is selecting your sides. The Arabic salad is my favorite, but the hummus and other options are delicious too. The service is super-friendly and if you go more than once, you're likely to be remembered. If there is any room for improvement, the iced tea (another addiction of ours) could use a little work -- but the food is so incredibly delicious (emphasis on INCREDIBLE!), it's a minor afterthought.  As for the grocery, there are countless treats to be found here, from spices to candies to foodstuffs guaranteed to make your mouth water. However, before you go pay your bill at the register, a MUST-DO is the baklava and namura (coconut cake) counter in the back. It's just about the very best I've ever, ever tasted -- and these sweet treats alone might keep you coming back again and again and again.  If Yelp allowed a 6-star rating, PM would get it from me. Go. Go now. You deserve it!",

    "text": "I used to be regular at this restaurant.  Over the course of time I have unfortunately seen the quality of this place slip.  I used to really enjoy this place.  The Princess Combo was good.    I went to Princess last night with my wife.  We ordered the Princess Combo.  The following are some of the observations noted:  1) The cleanliness of the place has slipped.  Please clean your booths and tables (the tables and the floors).  It was nearly impossible to find a clean table.  Cleanliness is something that my wife and I do not compromise on.  We have been to the developing world, and even with that, we still find restaurants in the developing world much cleaner.    2) Some of the dishes need to be cleaned better.  I had a water glass that was stained, and asked for a new glass.  Please pay attention to this.    3) My wife found the beef or lamb kabab, in the Princess Combo (do not know which one it was) as being very chewy (inedible).  We enjoy kababs but it was just too chewy.  We could not determine if it was beef or lamb.  It was just too chewy.  Either it was overcooked, or undercooked (I am guessing overcooked...it was not red or raw).  My wife and I have experienced Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food and we love it.  We have been to that part of the world, and have many friends who are from that part of the world.    Also, a lot of my colleagues where I work know that I tend to find restaurants that are \"diamonds in the rough\".  I used to think that Princess was one of them.  I am questioning this now.    Many of my colleagues are former military, and politics aside, they have been deployed in the Middle East, and they remember that corner cafe or related in Saudi, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Turkey, etc.  They acquired that taste while serving there.  They often ask me about places I recommend for Middle Eastern food.  I used to recommend this place.  I am questioning whether to recommend this place now.    Please take a long and hard look at your place:  1) Clean it up 2) Figure out what has changed (for the worse), and fix it as far as food  I trust that you have a good people who mean well.  Perhaps a little training may be all that is needed.    You have a good \"product\" or \"service\", you just need to burnish your image a little bit in order to \"return\" to what I would call a 5 star rating.    I recommend you do it soon so that the reputation of the place is not tarnished.  I want this place to do well, but you need to re-double your efforts and go back to the basics.",

There are just a little over a dozen items but all were really good, and the grilled chicken deserves special mention - it was fantastic, like no other grilled chicken I've tried anywhere else. The other items were mostly standard dishes found in other Mediterranean restaurants, but prepared very well here. Also, each person who partakes of the buffet is served a tender, very nicely seasoned lamb shank - that alone would already justify the price of the whole buffet!  In all it was a really delicious meal, and a really great deal at 10 bucks.",

    "text": "Wow, my condolences to the people living in the Phoenix area for having such limited access to great Middle Eastern restaurants.  I live in Dallas, Texas, where there's an abundance and highly competitive market for Middle Eastern food, and my in-laws are from Chicago where Middle Eastern, particularly Palestinian, cuisine is on par with the quality from overseas.  Also, my family owns a well known restaurant in Dallas so I have been trained and learned the appropriate way to treat customers.  Therefore, please keep in mind while reading this review the type of customer service and food quality that I am used to.     We made a reservation blindly; we had no idea what this restaurant looked like (i.e. how small, dark, and old it looked) or even where it was located.  Because it's Ramadan, we made the reservation for their iftar buffet, which promptly starts at 7:30 p.m.  We get there about 15 minutes late (which in Dallas and anywhere else, I believe, is not an issue) and notify a young man, I'm assuming an assistant manager/manager due to his demeanor, that we had a reservation.  We were hoping that he would warmly greet us and then guide us to our reserved table.  Instead, we were met with callousness when he proceeded to curtly tell us that because we are late, our table was given away (he didn't even visually scan the seating area to confirm this), we should have been there at exactly 7:30, we have no place to sit, and we were warned about this when making the reservation, which we weren't.  He was pretty much telling us that we were shit out of luck and bye!  My family and I stood there completely shocked by his answer and demeanor; it was unapologetic, confrontational, and unsympathetic.  He seemed stressed out.  Maybe their restaurant is not used to having a full house, which in this case is about only 30 people... Luckily, an assertive young lady came to our rescue by bypassing this young man and said, \"Hey, table 1 is empty (most likely our reserved table), let them sit there!\" The young man looked annoyed that his authority was undermined, rolled his eyes, and, without moving from his place, pointed us to table one.  I don't know what his role at this restaurant is, but he utterly failed in the customer relations department.  Almost everyone who works here is very young and there didn't seem to be an experienced restauranteur around to guide them.  Customer service 1 out 5!  Food was meh.  Their selection was incredibly limited.  I believe they had about 12 items (which includes fruit and salad) in their buffet?  All of the Middle Eastern restaurants in Dallas (Afrah, Sababa, Jasmine, Sultan, and Sanabel's) offers at least 30 items.  But hey, that's the largest buffet stand they have so they do what they can.  The food was not memorable.  As I write this review, I can't even remember what I had from there. I only remember the really bad taste in my mouth from dealing with that young man.   Basically, I understand why locals rate this place 4 stars or higher; they don't have access to better Middle Eastern food!  Because Dallas is a highly competitive food market, the managers/owners will treat everyone with respect and tries their hardest to win over customers through their service and quality of food.  For example, during Ramadan, Afrah's owner, who was featured on Food Network's Guy Fieri's show, is there every night greeting customers and making sure that everyone is treated well.  His restaurant can occupy 250, I believe.  You can imagine how hectic the restaurant gets during Ramadan, but one day my husband and I show up without a reservation and the place is completely packed, but he tells us, \"Don't worry, I'll look for a table for you and make it happen!\"  He knows that we are tired and hungry from fasting, and behold, he arranges an empty table for us among a sea of people.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the standard for good customer service and an example of an owner who is dedicated to building a loyal customer base.    So to the people of Arizona, if you ever come to Dallas, Texas, try out one or as many of the Middle Eastern restaurants I mentioned and you will be in awe of their food and at the same time angered by the realization of the subpar service and food you all endure.",

Not an insane amount of food for $22 but enough and will be a solid meal.  We also had some white cream cheese dip appetizer that we didn't love. It needs something else like a ground hot beef or gyro meat on top. It's a bit tart.  They gave us a little $1 Baklava to try for free. It's about 2 bites but also delicious.  So the big question everyone would have that is into middle eastern food is how does it stack up to Haji Baba. Well, it's better in all ways except for the Shawarma and the Garlic Mayo. I'm still not sure why no one else makes their shwarma and garlic mayo like Haji!!! Drives me nuts.  The beef at this place and Gyro is def better than Haji. The beef Shawrma was fantastic. Haji has horrible beef in pretty much most forms it comes.  Great spot!",

On my way back from Phx today I took the Broadway exit off of the 101. With a hungry belly I stopped at a busy place called the Princess.   Upon walking in I saw a smiling face and got a welcome hug from my friend Adin! I was so glad to see him. He is such a kind and gentle soul.   I made my way past all the Mediterranean market goods and made my order at the back counter. I ordered the grilled salmon plate and the chicken Schwarma plate. I ordered a cup of spicy olives to go. After ordering I wandered around and found a tasty recommended tahini, turmeric and sesame seeds.   While waiting for the food I chatted with the young lady who took my order who was very helpful and a good conversationalist and the owners daughter which happens to speak somewhere between 6-9 languages. She told me her parents love store and about their food.   I DEVOURED the food as soon as I got home. It was delicious and flavorful. The tabouli and hummus were fantastic and I loved the salmon. My wife loves the chicken which was moist and wonderfully spiced. The tzaziki sauce was top notch and the spicy olive mix made the meal.   I will be back neighbor!!!",

    "text": "This is a review for the restaurant portion of the shop. I was not expecting the restaurant to be inside a market (though I should have suspected, given the name). My husband was the one who found the restaurant on yelp and we happened to be in the area. We ordered the chicken shawarma plate and a side of falafels as a pre-lunch snack. The shawarma plate tasted very delicate and mild, so I was glad to have the falafels on the side to balance out the meal with a kick. The woman who served us was very friendly! The process was new to us though. After entering we were told how to order our food and check out. So as you enter you go straight to the back and order your meal at the counter. You will be given a number and can take your seat to the right side of the shop. The food will come to you and after your meal, you pay at the very front at the checkout counter. I saw a few people coming straight in and taking a seat immediately, waiting to be served (and they were shortly after arrival), but upon entry we were told that this is how the process works (or maybe the most efficient way for them)? The young man at the counter was very personable and friendly. From our conversation I found out that he is about to graduate high school, so congratulate him if you meet him!",

At first, I was thought it wouldn't be enough for all of us - me, husband, four little kids - but I figured we'd make the kids a sandwich later, if needed. We went to town on the food. The salad was great, hummus and shawarma sauce was bomb, chicken and rice were good. Husband and I filled up fast and then divvied out the rest to kids.   Somehow those two to-go boxes filled up our who family! And it was sooooo delicious. All the kids loved it and my toddler was obsessed with the pita and hummus. I can't wait to go into the actual restaurant sometime.",

Well that's exactly what happened...  Walked in and sat in a nearly empty restaurant with my baby on a Friday night. We ordered drinks -- coke & water -- and by the time our waitress was back with our drinks we knew what we wanted to order, the Princess Combo (chicken & beef kabob, chicken & beef shawarma, rice, salad, and hummus).   Then... we waited, and waited, and waited some more. I even joked and said our waitress forgot to place our order... my man assured me they didn't. After waiting for 30 minutes, we got restless. We almost walked out without even getting our food, but my man asked the waitress, who said \"they were working on it\". Umm. Were they just now running around to catch the chickens in the back? Counting the pieces of rice? What on earth could possibly take so long?!   We told the waitress to just make our order to-go at this point; we were so hungry but we lost our appetite. She finally brought our food out and we were on our way home -- starving and disappointed.   Once we arrived home, we opened up the food -- which in all honesty smelled delicious. The taste? Okay. Nothing spectacular. My man's cooking is way better, more flavorful, and for the $30 we spent at Princess Mediterranean, we could've eaten for a whole week. We won't be back.",

I wasn't that hungry and thought I'd only take a couple of bites of my combo plate and save the rest for later; instead, I ate most of it and saved just a couple of bites for later.

    "text": "Before I get to the food, etc. I made an observation here that was quite disturbing from an infection control perspective. The young woman wiping down the tables was using the same rag to wipe both table tops and seats without even rinsing the rag between surfaces. Ideally, she should have two separate rags--one for table tops and one for seats. The thought of smearing e. coli from the seats onto the eating surface was creepy.   This is a hybrid grocery store and sit-down restaurant. The decor is sparse and be careful when walking in the dining area for unlevel surfaces (a mix of vinyl and ceramic tile making for different height walking surfaces). When I entered I was told to sit anywhere. The only two booths that were open had crumbs and food debris on both the table and seat (but once I saw how these surfaces are cleaned, I was just as happy to not have these surfaces \"cleaned\").  I had the chicken kabob sandwich ($4.50) and it had plenty of grilled chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and tahini sauce in a soft pita. It was tasty. I also got some very good walnut baklava to go ($7.99 per pound). The server drops the check at your table and you pay at the cash register as you leave. A single cash register handles both the grocery and restaurant portions of the business.  Parking is very tight and the parking lot is laid out weird, so careful backing up. Would I go here again? The food was tasty and reasonably priced (4 stars), but I don't think I can handle the thought of eating off a surface that been \"cleaned\" with the same rag used to clean the places where people park their buttocks (minus 2 stars).",

    "text": "We had an awesome first experience. Not knowing how everything works here (it's both a grocery store and restaurant) we went to the counter and placed our order. The guy taking our order recommended the shawarma s we ordered the gyro and beef shawarma plates. We got so much food and all was amazing. The meat was delicious and super flavorful, and the rice was well cooked and really light. The fresh hummus was the best part by far however.   The workers were very attentive to us and made sure we were having a good experience. They even brought out a little baklava dessert for both of us (seems like they do that a lot), but it was great and a nice touch.  We walked through the market afterwards and found some cool things to take home and try! We will be coming back and trying more of the menu in the future for sure!",

    "text": "Found another hidden pocket of goodness- to make you sleep within 7 minutes of finishing your meal!! No kidding! If you're having problems sleeping at night make sure to check this place out for dinner! ;) Your taste buds will enjoy the food and your brain will enjoy its \"powers\" to put you to sleep (like a food coma). But really- the dishes were delectable.   This is in the NE corner if 101-N and Broadway. With the outside sign a bit tattered, this little market still boasts a dining experience to talk about. Staff immediately greeted and asked whether it was dining in or ordering to go and chose to dine in. To the right there were several tables and booths to choose from. Immediately was given menus and asked if ready to order. Waitress was attentive. Chicken shawarma sandwich was around $4 and the kabob combo (kabobs of chicken, beef, and lamb) with rice, salad, hummus and warm pita was about $12. When asking the waitress what kinds if meat was in the combo she said she doesn't know- and just works there. That was odd because I would have thought that if she wasn't knowledgable about what was on the plate that she could have at least asked the other staff. A skilled worker should at least be knowledgable about those basic popular dishes. Maybe in time. Minus that part everything was exceptional. Baklava was super sweet and delicious. Ended up buying a few more baklava to go! Once you're done just check out with the pleasant cashier at the front, and off to get some powerful coffee or to that comfy bed awaiting. ;)",

Definitely check out the market itself, I always pick up some spices, tea, and pita, but they also have some cooking utensils and frozen foods. The only thing I wish they had was halal meat but no butcher shop here :/ The food is worth the trip from Glendale!",

The falafel & hummus are amazing, and the market sells the falafel mix to take home and do it yourself. It's a very very casual place, more of a market than a restaurant, but after eating there you want to go buy groceries and make your own Mediterranean food at home! I bought some cold brew lemon & lime tea that is to die for. Anyway, back to the restaurant- the meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection (they sell the seasoning too) and the rice was - oh heck everything was great! Just go there and try the sampler dinners so you get a little taste of everything!",

I am sorry to say, I will no longer be making the 20 min drive and giving my business to this once great family owned business. Unfortunately the service has diminished greatly with the passing of the owner. He would be ashamed how his staff (family) treated their guests. This has been the 2nd time in as many weeks. Sad...because I really enjoyed the food. I hope they figure it out quickly, because at this pace, they won't be around to carry on the family business.",

As with many of the best restaurants in the area, the exterior doesn't look like much, but our fortunes changed once we got inside. The waitstaff was courteous and patient with my questions, and although the food took a while to come, it was absolutely worth the wait. I split a side of falafel and the Princess combo with a friend, and both were excellent. One recommendation for those who order platters here: you can switch around the default sides, for example, having tabbouleh instead of garden salad, or baba ganoush instead of rice, and I recommend this. You get a free baklava (or drink) for checking in, and I love the pistachio. When we went, the owner gave us not only this, but a piece of almond baklava, and another dessert to try. Have some turkish coffee to wash it down with, and you're set. Definitely recommended.",

It's also a great place to go for spices, teas and other middle eastern cooking supplies. I come for the Al-Wazah tea, which my Saudi friend always used to make. Also, for lunch (it's not too far from my work) I like getting a mix of grape leaves, falafel and hummus. Their hummus is OK but the baba ganoush is actually pretty good.  They have a lunch buffet, too, but I haven't been adventurous enough to try it, especially since I'm a vegetarian and most of the food seems meaty...  The place is also stocked with hookahs and other things, like calling cards and Quran-alarm clocks.",

But the service seems to get worse and worse with every visit. We waited almost 30 minutes for our meals with no apologies or explanations; in fact, we appeared to remain invisible at our table after ordering, and again once the food finally arrived. Well ok, that's not entirely True - we were offered soda refills but never received them. This place is definitely worth the trip for good, affordable food in a casual environment, but not if you're in a hurry or are expecting anyone to seem to care about your experience until after you've already eaten. If you're looking for a job as a waiter, however, stop by an apply. Maybe then they'll get the hint!",

This is not our area of town, we were there shopping nearby.  Anyway, you walk into a nice market, then turn right and there is a good size area for full service dining.  We ordered the chicken shwarma and another meat sandwich (boyfriend ordered it, can't remember the name).  They were both delicious.  The service was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  You think it's just a store at first then turn right and it's full service dining.  We got a free baklava which tasted sooo soo good. It was fun to shop around after eating as well, many spices and new things to see.  I would eat there again for sure.  Our waitress was super nice and the food was delicious.",

They had a lot of Middle Eastern foods, with American items in the mix, too.  The staff is great! I was greeted as soon as I walked in.  I got the beef gyro plate, which came with your choice of 3 sides. I got the hummus, baba ghanoush, and tabbouleh. They also offer fries, but why the heck would I get fries at a Mediterranean deli? Crazy talk! The meat was sliced thinly, super tender, and had the right amount of grease. Hey, if you're gonna eat meat, you gotta have some grease, right? RIGHT? The sides were great, too. They were drizzled with olive oil, which always tells me I'm at a place that knows how to make the food they are advertising. I have the leftovers in the fridge, and can't wait to eat it! I will definitely be back. Again. And again. And again.",

I got the gyro plate with a few salads on the side.  It's reasonably priced and they serve it with warm pita bread.  Next time I will ask for more salads and less meat (just my personal preference), but everything was tasty. And the tsatziki sauce was yum yum yum.  I'll come back on Friday and check out the buffet.  (Only 12-4!)",

I did not receive the drink that was supposed to come with my combo- not sure if this was Door Dashes fault or the restaurants. Also when someone orders hummus, you'd usually expect it to come with pita like the website says it does. We got maybe 8 quartered pita slices, so like 2 whole pita breads, which is pretty disappointing when you're trying to eat hummus both with the gyro entree (meat and hummus) and an entire appetizer of hummus between 2 people. I spent 40+$ on this meal but it was worth more like 20$ because of the overall \"meh\" factor.",

Chicken kabob: Dry chicken because they use chicken breast but packed with flavor. I would suggest chicken thigh meat.  Kofta - Not the best I've had, but no complaints either. Right soft bouncy texture with enough flavor.  Steak - The best one! Came medium rare. Soft and flavorful (same spices as the chicken kabob).  Hummus - Smooth texture.   Service:  They took my order and money with a smile. Not much service necessary at a place like this.   Environment:  Order in a grocery store type counter and pay for it in an actual grocery store counter. You can eat it in the grocery store if you want....awkward Asian guy sitting in the store....no thanks.   Price:  $11.50 for quite a bit of food. I thought it was fairly priced.

Well, as luck would have it, Amazon Restaurants sent me a $20 gift card so I decided to give it another go. All I can say is that I'm glad the meal was practically free.   The chicken was skimpy. The tabouli had hard particles in it which I about cracked a tooth on. There was a spoonful of hummus (like 2 bites worth) and the rice, which was most of the meal, was not edible. The only way I can describe it is that the rice had the same flavor that Subway sandwiches have when they throw them on that black mat in the oven to heat up...you know that pungent chemically scent that tastes as bad as it smells.  I really didn't eat much of anything other than pita bread and tzatziki sauce. The worst part was that I was excited to let my youngest taste baklava for the 1st time. I ordered 4 pieces and got nothing...nada...zero...zilch.   I don't operate on the three strikes rule and there are plenty of Mediterranean joints around the valley to choose from that have better food for the same price.",

    "text": "We ordered food from here using a third party food delivery service.  I got the schwarma plate with both beef and chicken, the gyro plate, and the Greek salad.  Each of the plates came with a tiny side \"salad\" (really just lettuce) and a small side of hummus.  Their hummus was really good!  The pita it came with wasn't my favorite because I like the fluffier pita bread.  The meat in each of the plates was good, flavorful and tender.  The Greek salad was also good, but HUGE.  And unfortunately they had pre-mixed the dressing in and since I could not finish the salad all in one meal it turned out to be too soggy and I had to throw the rest away.  Next time I'll be sure to request dressing on the side... although usually whenever you order delivery the dressing is packaged on the side!  Overall, we would order from here again - especially the hummus.",

The Gyro sandwich was the best one I've ever had; it was delicious, and not greasy, nor was it dry. It was just perfect. And the hummus, which is home made, was fantastic. Beats the pants off what I got for twice the cost at Pita Jungle. The baklava? The walnut was good, but the pistachio was divine!   The prices here are amazing, and the service is excellent. Sadi, the gentleman that invited me back, is a great representation of what excellent customer service is about. He's made me feel like more than just a customer; he made me feel like family here. The store is undergoing some changes (it's been here for over 10 years!) but Sadi is marketing the business out and the food will speak for itself.  They have a Gyro Combo: Gyro, fries, and a fountain drink for $4.95. Come give it a try, get some shisha for your hookah (they're also a middle eastern grocery store), and bring a friend! It's worth it!",

It is rarely very busy so getting a table at lunch is easy. I used to get the Chicken Shawarma but since the buffet was put in I just stick with that. All the meats are halal if that is important to you.   The lunch buffet on Friday and Saturdays is a must, the chicken has some kind of spice that just rocks. I always eat way to much of the chicken. Everyone I have brought here just raves about it.  The buffet is simple with hummus, chopped salad, lamb (I don't eat lamb), chicken, rice, and a couple of other dishes that get rotated. They will also bring hot pita bread upon request.   The only down comment is that the service is kind of slow with drink refills. On numerous occasions I have had to get up and go to the counter to get a refill of water. No fresh brewed iced tea, booo! There is always one guy (the same guy) waiting tables. The food makes up for this.",

    "text": "This is a hole-in-the-wall type restaurant. Its part of a market/grocery store as everyone else has already noted. Its a little hidden, and I think that hurts this place a little bit.  Anyways, the food is VERY good. The chicken shawarma is probably some of the best I have ever had. Hummus, yellow rice, and couscous also go very well with the food. There is the garlic-butter sauce that comes with the shawarma and kabobs, and that REALLY makes the food that much better. Gyro plate is also very commendable, but its hard to get this wrong since the gyro comes on a huge slab and rotates on a rotisserie. Yet, a lot of places do get the gyro plate wrong. I think this place does a good job of heating up the gyro meat on the rotisserie and then the grill.  Baklava also deserves a mention. Its damn good. You can get some exotic mediterranean stuff like olives and feta cheese by the pound, i love that stuff.  The pricing of this place along with the good quality food makes this place a hidden gem. Its like $8 for almost any plate you'd want. Its plenty of food per plate, and for under $20 for 2 people, its worth a visit. Its very easy to compare this stuff to haji baba, its a tough pick. However, I think the hummus here tastes much better, it doesn't taste like its straight out of a can. The plates here I think are a better deal. If you just want a gyro sandwich, then go to haji baba.",

Portions are a bit on the small side, which is unusual for the kind of restaurant that it is. What pisses me off is that the don't have unlimited lamb shanks in their buffet anymore, which kinda defeats the purpose of a buffet. Now you can only get one per buffet, and it was the only thing that you could convince your brain to cough up 10 something bucks for the other things are ehh. You're better off ordering something from their menu, the things on there are actually good.",

    "text": "This is the spot! It's become difficult to drive down the 101 without stopping off for a quick gyro and hummus to go! Everything tastes so fresh and is made with the kind of authentic home-cooked middle eastern taste that I've learned to expect. The \"main guy\" running the shop isn't much of a talker but his honesty is refreshing. And as long as the food keeps tasting amazing at the price remains so reasonable, I'm a patron for life. OOooo and don't forget to try the freshly made baklava! I took a tray into my office last week because I was so excited to share my newfound discovery.",

While visiting my daughter in the Phoenix area she introduced me to Princess.  It was a pleasure to find such outstanding cuisine with personable service.    I look forward to my next visit and recommend Princess to anyone looking for authentic Mediterranean food.",

    "text": "I recently moved to Phoenix from the Chicago area.  I looked for authentic Mediterranean food that lived up to a high standard set by the many options of the Chicago area.   I discovered Princess, and I now eat lunch here at least twice a month.  Not only is it the best Mediterranean food in the Phoenix area but it has a great environment with lots of character and the owner is personally aware of customer service.  The restaurant is alway clean and the food is excellent.   I read the previous unfavorable review by Sue C. and wondered where this person was eating because the review was complete unTrue.  I as well as many of my friends frequent Princess and you should consider that review as invalid.  If you are looking for good affordable Mediterranean food there is no better place to go.",

The man behind the to go order counter area clearly saw us walk in... we waited,  and waited. For about ten minutes we waited for something... anything,  we got nothing... completely ignored. We left, I wonder if the people who went in as we were leaving got the same treatment?",

    "text": "The food was great. The hummus was so smooth and creamy and along with the chicken was some of the best mid-eastern food I've had in a long time. Plus, we were able to get a coupon on Groupon which gave us $6 worth of food (that's two gyro sandwiches) for the price of $3! I don't care what else you have to say about the restaurant, you can't find even mediocre food for $3 anywhere! As far as looks of the restaurant are concerned, it is very clean. It's very casual and they didn't focus too much on the decor because, yes, it is a supermarket first and foremost. If that is too much of a problem for you, I suggest take out. All I know is, it's good, clean, and worth the trip out there.",

It also has a great market selection, mine being the deserts and sweets. The plates have some good choice, I go the way of a main kabob, rice (mmmm), hummus and fries. They also lay on the pita bread, so its all good here. Oh, and be sure to bring someone you can converse with or something to read, its not fast food, so relax.",
