The wait staff was extremely efficient and attentive. Much to our surprise, two musicians started playing and serenading us. It was lovely. They had rich voices and played guitar, harmonica, and maracas. Our food was piping hot and delicious. By the time we finished, there was a wait. The server constantly filled our water. We will definitely be back.",

She was like an energizer bunny and multi tasked better than anyone I have seen in a long time. Anyway the service was wonderful, atmosphere great and the food very good too.

I really enjoyed the taste of the shredded beef in both the chimichanga and the flautas. Next time I will order carnitas chimichangas and fried ice cream. The delivery girl was also nice and punctual when delivering my food. My only complaint was the horchata. It did not have a distinctive cinnamon flavor, although, my real complaint is the cup size. The cup size leaves much to be desired.",

The atmosphere was the real deal. They had live music going from table to table. We got the queso, which had a generous portion of chorizo, cheese enchiladas (get the red sauce!), chicken chimichanga (fried to perfection!), and the vegetable quesadilla  (great flavor and veggies).

Super friendly server. I asked to use a coupon from my phone and they accepted it.  The food was pretty good, could have used some more seasoning, a little on the bland side. I am a fan of the rice they have with the cilantro, and the pinto beans with cheese were delicious. The portions are plentiful and the prices are very reasonable.

The table and chairs are beautiful with a Mexican painting on each and finished with high gloss sealant.  It is very clean. The staff friendly.   I had not ordered a Mexican Pizza in a very long time so I decided I would get the Beef Mexican Pizza. To my surprise it was huge. The size of a cheese crisp. Ones I ordered at other places were personal pizza size on a thicker crust.   The crust was thin on this one which is a problem BC all those toppings made it soggy. This item should be served on a thicker crust or Indian Fry Bread. Aside from the soggyness, the flavor was very good.   The rice was different from what I'm used too. It was green in color with corn and green chilies. Tasted fine but I really like the regular rice better.  Daughter order 3 chicken tacos, rice and beans which was a shocker BC 99.8% of the time she gets a cheese crisp. . The chicken was fresh and flavorful.  Honestly everything had good flavor.  If you like Serrano's, I think you'll like this place a little better.",

    "text": "I heard some rave reviews from people at church regarding this place and since it's only a couple doors down from our church, thought, why not?  I wanted to invite some others from church to join us for lunch, but my husband was already overwhelmed, so we decided to just go ourselves.  Loved the decor, which the place is very bright and clean with lots of beautiful things.  Loved the chairs and tables, that had colorful Mexican type art.  My son took a lot of pictures and that just made us seem so Asian, but he, we love our cameras.  Loved the glasses that our water and sodas came in.  I thought the prices would be a little less as people from my church said it was cheap, but we don't really eat Mexican and I thought cheap meant like $4-7 range.  That it was not, but closer to near the $10 range, but not a big deal.  We liked the tortilla chips that came out in a cute basket and the addicting salsa in cute little salsa bowls.  I could've just eaten this for lunch.  Really loved the colorfulness of this restaurant.  It would have been nice had they proved spoons with the salsa.  The napkins were colorful cloth napkins, which were nice, but I think I still like paper napkins better, but that's not really a big issue.  Each of the kids ordered a 3 enchiladas and they got a mixture of cheese, beef, and chicken and the waitress only charged us $8.95 for each of their items.  It also came with rice and beans.  The rice was a different type of rice rather than the orangish Mexican rice normally served at many gringo style Mexican restaurants.  This was more of a poblano, cilantro rice, which was good, but needed more salt.  Each plate had refried beans topped with cheese (well, three of the four plates had cheese topping the refried beans).  This was the only thing that wasn't too great and I would have preferred black beans or something that wasn't so pastey thick.  My husband ordered 3 street steak tacos (rib eye) and these came with plenty of beef, which he liked.  Each dish had some pico de gallo, and I wished this was more.  He liked the tacos.  I ordered a 3 item plate consisting of a carnitas taco, chicken tamale and a chili relleno .  I was glad the chili relleno wasn't breaded, as it's normally so this made it less greasy.  I liked the taste of the taco, which was not a soft taco, but where the shell is deep fried with the meat in it.  I think they could have put more carnitas in the taco, though.  Did not get to eat the chicken tamale as 1 taco and 1/2 of the relleno.  Ate all my beans, and a little of the rice and I was totally stuffed.  My son was able to eat most of his food, minus one enchilada of the three and my daughter ate all her plate.  My husband ate all his tacos and most of the rice and beans.  As we were nearly done with our food, quite a few people from our church showed up and the restaurant was starting to have a little bit more action.  We were the only ones here for most of the time we were here.    Will be back.  The service was good, the waitress attentive to our needs.  No issues here.",

I usually buy them plain, but these come with either a red/green sauce over it.  I found out that on Thursday's they have a $2.00 tamale deal, so I may go back to pick up a dozen.  They have a good looking menu that makes me want to try some other things out.  They haven't disappointed yet and I hope they never do.  I'm always down to eat me some good authentic Mexican food.

I ordered my food to go and got the queso fundido dip appetizer to put on top of my chicken Chimi. The chicken for one thing was bland and flavorless, even with sauce on it. But the queso dip...I have no idea what the hell they gave me. It certainly wasn't a dip. I literally had to cut it as it was just a SLICE OF CHEESE with some chorizo and jalepeno thrown on there. I love mexican food, so I figured it would try it all together. Wrong. All wrong. It was disgusting. I've had a better chimi from a gas station. I am so shocked at how this place has such a high rating. Go to Arribas or Valle Luna. Rositas is great, too. This was just plain garbage.",

I ordered the shrimp tacos and was really excited when I read \"shrimp grilled served with our cabbage mix and chipotle dressing\"...That was definitely not what I received. I got shrimp in a cold corn tortilla. That's it. No cabbage mix, no chipotle dressing. It was shrimp in a tortilla that I paid $10 for. There was no flavor to anything, it was dry and I'm pretty sure I'm on the verge of food poisoning (Yes, I'm typing this 30 minutes after attempting to eat their food).  A vegetarian in our group ordered 3 cheese enchiladas and one of us ordered 3 chicken enchiladas, we got 6 chicken enchiladas. So, one of us couldn't even eat because when I called, rather than attempting to correct the issue, they said \"the cooks said they made 3 cheese and 3 chicken.\" I understand that they probably made them, but that's not what was delivered.  I also ordered an order of their bunuelos and I didn't receive them. Their response to that was \"you'll have to contact eatstreet for a refund.\"   I'm very disappointed I spent $70 on food (including a hefty tip for the driver) and this is the kind of service I received. I will definitely never eat here again. No thanks, but thank you for the food poisoning!",

The menu has a veggie section, and what is super cool is that these are not items you see everywhere. I can not remember the details, but there is a bunuelo dish. These are like little sopapillas. There is also a bean masa dish. Masa is the stuff tamales are made of. It is really unique, and good. This has become a favorite lunch spot.   The only thing I have ever tried there that was sub-par was the horchata. But it might have been a bad batch.  I would definitely recommend it., especially for veggies who would like a hassle-free vegetarian Mexican food experience.",

To this day I still have not found a place that I can give 5 stars to yet.   I will say the food here was good. The refined beans were tasty, the Mexican rice had a great taste, and the hard shell taco plate with carnitas was alright. Couldn't really taste any seasoning on the carnitas but the shells were amazing and crunchy. If you enjoy cilantro you will love this place. Salsa is very very mild roasted green chili with cilantro that I would say gives the salsa its flavor. The green sauce at the two Mexican fast food joints near here are hotter.   Overall service was great, love the decorations inside, and the authentic spanish music that is played! Gives you a great vibe while eating and a feeling of being in Mexico!",

Been here several times now after a friend had mentioned it a few times. The atmosphere is very much the mexican theme popular in some bigger restaurants but the size and wonderful service remind you it's a True local spot. The service here is always great with friendly employees who are quick to refill drinks and keep the chips and salsa coming (did I mention I like the chips and salsa?).  After coming here the first time and being very impressed with the fiesta combo with I think it was a taco, tamale and tostada I had the confidence to do what I don't do at most mexican places and try the fish tacos and shrimp ceviche both of were very tasty, I think the tacos were the better of the two however. All of the prices are extremely reasonable especially on the combos and taco Tuesday.",

    "text": "Stopped in on a Saturday evening and the place was pretty full. A couple entered the same time as us and were sat and greeted with chips and drinks. After we sat,  we were kinda looking around wondering why nobody was greeting us. Two more couples came in and were given chips before us. I told my boyfriend that if they didnt come over in two minutes we were leaving.  All of sudden they greeted us so we were stuck.  We ordered an appetizer and waited  for it to arrive while everyone who came in AFTER us was finishing their entree and waiting for their bill.  We were beyond frustrated. The appetizer was nothing but thick melted cheese on a skillet. We thought it would be more of a thick dip.  After everyone else left we got our  food.  The people that came in 20 minutes after us got their food two minutes after us.   I asked for sour cream with my order and when i got my plate there wasnt any. Considering they Charge $1 ud think they'd remember that.  Portions were kind of small. my burrito was soggy and i couldn't eat the ends becuz they were so doughy.   The reason we came here was becuz the pollack cinema had an ad that u could get $2 off per entree with ticket.  I tried to use and girl said it has to be used the same day as ur movie. The ad at  the movie does not say that. Total bait and switch. Like perfect definition of it. Girl heard me complain and came back saying she would take it. I told her it was ok and not to worry about it (Becuz another table was staring at me and i didnt wanna seem cheap or like a baby.)   We had three different people wait on us so maybe that had something to do with our poor experience",

The salsa was okay,  not the most memorable, but the guacamole was DELISH and much recommended. It's chunky, perfectly oniony & garlicky, but also a little sweet from the mango. A really great marriage of flavors!!   There were quite a few vegetarian options and the beans are lard free. My friend had the shrimp tacos and I had the calabacitas.   We would definitely go to this place again.",

Today we were asked to move to a different table (where they had seated us) so that a larger party (who arrived well after us) could spread out to our table and space.  Fortunately our food hadn't arrived yet, just in the middle of chips and drinks, but unfortunately our new table had booth benches on both sides.  I don't know if it's the angle or what, but their booth benches just kill my back.  This has never happened to me in a restaurant before, probably will not return.",

    "text": "I hate giving this place two stars because the waitress was really awesome, the restaurant was very clean and festive but the food was not good at all.  My family and I decided to try this place for their happy hour.    I ordered the grilled jalapenos which is described on their menu as  grilled jalapenos stuffed with a blend of Monterrey and jack cheese, wrapped in bacon and finished with a cilantro dressing.....sounds good right?......what I actually got were six sorry excuses for jalapenos, burned at the bottom, seeds NOT removed with sprinkled cheese and bacon bits!  Not wrapped in bacon and because of the seeds they were so hot you could not eat them.  The next item I ordered was Juana's combo platter.  This came with a tamale, 2 mini chicken chimi's, 2 taquitos, a mini quesadilla and guacamole.  Sadly my tamale was cold in the middle.  It had a green olive in it that was somewhat frozen....yuck.  The other items were good.  The third and final item was their South of the Border nachos....you could tell they had made this item first because the cheese was congealed so that when you went to lift a nacho, you could lift the entire plate.  Once we peeled off the \"shield of cheese\" the center was total mush, as it had been sitting there for a while.  the only chips that were crispy were the ones around the edges.  I was really sad that my family and I did not like the food because our area needs a really good mexican food place.  They do have really good salsa but their chips were store bought, as in I think it was a bag of tostidos rounds and tostidos regular chips mixed together.    So if you want terrible food with great customer service you can go to la casa de juana.",

We didn't want the same ole pizza or sammys so we tried the little brother app to Yelp called Eat24. That app lists all delivery and take out restaurants. We had never tried this place before but most of the reviews were great.  We ordered three entree dinners. I had the biggest tamale I've ever had in my life. As I had let my hubby order for me I thought it was a burrito! And so full of chicken. And obviously not too much masa. The cheese chilies releno (can't spell) was not breaded. This was awesome. My taco was not the best but that was completely MY fault. I left it in the container too long and it became chewie. But what was in it was great.  Lime rice and beans completed the dinners.   We will continue to try new things at this location and even stop in.  Great Dinner!!",

And the chips kept coming.... Terrific icy margaritas (I'd get the rocks marg next time) and well-priced beverages. Every single thing we tried was delectable ... except the tamale. Why is that?

The food itself was slightly cold, the tortillas were cold and sub par, like maybe they had used Mission or some other store brand and then rolled them up in foil and then thrown in the microwave. The rice was flavorless and cold as well. The cheese on the refried beans had cooled over as well. The quesadillas were also plastic tasting.   The interior is fun and inviting, but it doesn't make up the food. This is a bummer, because I really wanted to like this place its just so creative on the inside, but the snooty waitresses and the cold, boring food is not worth the trouble.",

    "text": "**** - Decor **1/2 - Food **1/2 - Service Overall I would say it was okay, but I was not Wow'd or even inspired to come back \"real soon\". Growing up eating Mexican food,  and living more than half my life in the Southwest, I prefer a little more character in the food.   The Mexican Fried Rice had the most character because it's green.  I asked the waitress and was told Poblano and Cilantro, but I couldn't really tell. The rice was overcooked, but the flavor was alright.  The beans I would rate the lowest because they tasted like they were canned that were enhanced with just the sprinkle of cheese that's melted on top. We we pleasantly surprised by a dessert \"on the house\" that was simple and satisfying. A tiny flour tortilla filled with apple pie filling and a touch of cream/cheese, grilled like a quesadilla and then tossed in cinnamon sugar.  Mmm. I missed the fact they had a full bar.  Lots of temptation there.  Guess I may need to check out their happy hour deals. One last thing.  Our server was pleasant but so quiet and wasn't familiar with the specials.  She left without dropping the bill or telling us she was leaving -- so we waited for our check.  It was then I learned they had a full bar cuz I figured I needed to go to a register to pay. Gimme a server that is confident, brings some of that personality to her service and makes you glad you stopped in regardless of the food.",

I remember it suffered from serving like warm food which is something they fixed. I was there this week and my plate was hot. I even burned my mouth on the churro. Which note had a cream custard inside. They have Diet Coke and offer a spicy salsa if you ask. In general they do things right. The service is always kind. But also the service is average. Not bad just probably none of them have experience or been trained properly. The food is similar. It's basic. Nothing wrong here just not outstanding. It's a perfectly average place. There are much worse places and much better places. If you crave Mexican and your close by this will satisfy. I would never drive ten mile to eat here. Probably if I lived any place other than Arizona or New Mexico this place would be fine. Just lots of competition. Even with three  stars I recommend it. Just go expecting average.  I don't eat breakfast stuff but I am told that is the best stuff on the menu. Breakfast tacos served all day. You don't need to get a burrito for breakfast anymore.",

All of the colors are vibrant and the music is amazing. However, a restaurant also needs food service and good food - which La Casa De Juana lacked. Big time.   When we arrived, we were greeted and sat at a booth. We got there around 3:30 PM on a Wednesday afternoon, and it was dead. There was maybe another couple, and a regular at the bar. The waitress was nice enough, didn't rush us into ordering. However, the service was slow. Maybe a rush WAS in order? It wasn't horrible, but it felt like we were an after thought to Alma, the waitress.   We ordered some drinks and some appetizers. The food was okay, the margaritas were huge, but the nachos were soggy (and had everything on them that we asked not be on there). We wanted dinner, but there was a waitress swap and then we were given an even worse waitress.   This waitress stopped and asked how we were doing, and I think that's about all she asked. I felt like we had to beg for drink refills, and again, we waited for centuries to even be helped. By that time, we decided to go to another restaurant because we had spent about an hour and a half in there, with only one drink and one appetizer, and no dinner in sight.   So in short, margaritas were fine, nachos were soggy, waitresses were young girls who really couldn't care less about the service, which in turn really sullied our experience. We won't be back.",

The pico on the side had cucumbers in it but it was fine since it was just tiny pieces of it, I just can't stand regular size pieces of cucumbers. I was told the pico came with the cucumbers ahead of time too so it was all good. Our waitress the 2nd time around was really knowledgeable. I asked for a side of rice but decided not to get it after she informed me they made it with chicken broth, I really appreciated that since I am a True vegetarian.

First we had to seat ourselves because the one person that was working the front was to busy waiting on the two occupied tables. After waiting we seated ourselves adjacent to the Bar. It took about 10 or 15 min. Before the one guy was able to ask what we needed. We ordered the Jauna combination Hors d oeuvres and the happy hour blended margaritas no salt. Again we sat and sat until I watched the one guy making margaritas on the rocks...alas they were for another customer. We waited and waited and then finally the one guy was behind the bar making blended margaritas with salt but this time he barely put tequila at all into the blender about half of what he put into the margaritas on the rocks I'd watched him make earlier. Needless to say the margaritas were weak and the hors d oeuvres were meager.....will not be returning!!! Sometimes Yelp is spot on and apparently sometimes it is not.",

I came upon La Casa De Juana and has some questions regarding their menu. The website was very well put together and had all the information would could need. I just wanted to call and make sure no reservation was needed. The woman who answered the phone was just a joy! I got off the phone knowing that is where I wanted to treat my boyfriend for dinner.  Fast forward to Saturday night, we were seated within 2 minutes. Our first table was rather small and upon letting the waitress know that we'd prefer a bigger table she(without a single hassle) helped move us over to a bigger table. We ordered till our hearts content. The good was great, our waitress was amazing. We were even asked by another waitress if everything was good. Customer service was top notch. We were recommended the Flan for dessert and it did not disappoint!!  The atmosphere!!! I fell in love! Papel Picado on the ceiling, mariachi playing, the art on the walls..... Beautiful  Over all great experience! We just had to get a picture with our waitresses!:)",

    "text": "We stepped inside for dinner after a long work day, eager to try this new restaurant. In addition to your standard burritos, chimichangas, and tacos, they also offer options like sopes and have a small American style menu for those not wishing to eat Mexican food at a Mexican restaurant :).   We were seated immediately at a bright, comfortable booth. The decor is very festive and lively, with warm gold and yellow tones echoing throughout the restaurant. I loved the atmosphere, the unique tables, and the vivid, multi-colored cloth napkins. As soon as we were seated we received some chips and salsa. Both were quite good. The salsa was green and was filled with fire roasted green chiles, adding a nice spicy kick to go with the light, crisp chips. We looked through the menu and I decided on a 2 item combination plate ($8.95) with chile relleno and chicken enchilada, and. I also tried some carnitas chimichanga.   The chile relleno is a lighter version of what I usually see in restaurants. The poblano chile is not breaded and fried, but still stuffed with cheese. I enjoyed it, as the chile was perfectly cooked with good flavor. The chicken enchilada was filled with shredded white meat chicken. Again, it tasted like a lighter version of what I usually see in most restaurants. The rice was green, which was a unique twist, and had a more delicate flavor. The refried beans were decent, no complaints. The carnitas chimichanga was filled with tender carnitas pork, and I could taste a hint of cumin in the mix. Like the other components of my meal, this dish also had more of a delicate flavor.  Service was friendly and cheerful and we were checked on as needed.   They also have a breakfast menu that I might like to try some day. If you're looking for lighter tasting versions of Mexican favorites in a sunny, cheerful atmosphere, you've come to the right place!",

Granted one of the two times was an odd time. But the servers get swamped and they're \"in the weeds\". Lucky for them, I was a long time server in my youth and am well aware none of the scheduling has anything to do with them. I also know they were doing their absolute best with the situation they'd been given. My fear is, some customers will not give nearly as much grace as a vet, like myself. People who haven't been in the food industry don't have the same outlook as those of us who were.   As far as service, outside of those two times, it's always fantastic. The food is good and the salsa is SO good, I could drink it! Most of the time I'm happy to pay the $6.99 for a pint of salsa to take home. If you haven't tried this place, keep an eye out for their coupon in your junk mail. If you trust me, just go!",

    "text": "Very difficult decision here. Let's start with the beginning. I read on yelp how great the food was so we decided to check it out. After sitting down everything seemed to be what you would expect from a normal dining experience. First came the chips and salsa which were above average. The salsa was actually very very good. Unfortunately for us we had finished the entire basket of chips and salsa before we got our drinks and this sadly became a recurring theme. I watched 3 staff servers sit at the bar checking their cell phones as our margaritas slowly melted away on the bar top. The telephone would continuously ring as the hostess failed to answer. Other staff filled empty tables with napkins and silverware. While this was fairly entertaining I could only think of taking a few gulps of cold water to soothe my burning mouth from the aforementioned salsa. Finally we asked our server for our drinks. By this time our food had already been served. Unsurprisingly this was the saving grace because the food was genuinely tremendous. Nothing out of a freezer or microwave. Everything was prepared fresh and was very obvious whoever was in the kitchen had some serious skills. Honestly if it wasn't for the awful service I would give this place 5 stars. If you're in the neighborhood stop in and give it a try but wouldn't waste time driving across town.",

We finally ordered tonight after a long work week and a crazy 2 year old that we didn't want to take out to dinner.  I called for delivery and was told there was no driver this evening.  I asked if this was the norm and the gentleman who answered the phone asked if we lived far and the size of the order.  He took our number and asked if it was ok to see if anyone could deliver and he would call us back within five minutes.  He called back a minute later and took our order.  He was kind, concise and a pleasure to speak with.  Our order was delivered in 20-25 minutes.  Although the portions were smaller than anticipated I would rather take quality over quantity.  Having DELICIOUS Mexican food delivered is UNHEARD of!  I can't wait to come dine in the restaurant for the full experience.  S. Tempe is lacking in decent Mexican food and I sincerely welcome their presence (especially after a sickeningly awful experience at a local chain located on Rural and Guadalupe where we were stereotyped for having a child.) Much appreciated service!!!",

My house Margarita was just right, tangy, sweet, just enough ice and not watered down. My husband ordered the appetizer platter, which contained the best Tamale I have eaten in many years. Their guacamole was fresh and chunky and the house salsa was just spicy enough with a smokey roasted flavor- top notch!  All of us had the Friday evening special which was a chimichanga with beans and rice. Two of us had the pork Carnitas chimi and my husband had the beef chimi. The outside was extremely crispy without being burned in the least. The rice was outstanding and the beans were creamy and flavorful. The restaurant was very busy, and their staff was stretched a little thin but the wait was so well worth the wait. There was a wonderful guitar player also performing, certainly a nice touch.",

The salsa and chips were nice and tasty. The salsa was pleasantly warm with spice. They have a second salsa-if you ask-that has a strong smokey flavor. They said it was very spicy, but we thought the table salsa was hotter.   The margarita wasn't special. We wouldn't get it again unless it was happy hour.",

The menu options are great, very straight forward traditional fare and variety. I had the nachos for an appetizer, home made chips and all the fixings, very good. My main course was chicken enchiladas, the chicken was great. I do prefer shredded chicken and bit more \"soupy\" but that is my preference. I'm also a big fan of onions and those where not in any of items, just in their amazing homemade salsa which I loved. Overall great experience, very close to my home. I plan to be a loyal customer.

I also had a crunchy shredded beef taco with nicely seasoned shredded beef.  The rice is not your typical Spanish rice.  The rice is a cilantro lime rice (I think), it's very good. Chips and salsa are served and the salsa is the red chunky type and had great flavor.  My bf had a chimi that looked amazing!  He said it was delicious!   Btw, I'm Latina :)",

For the portion size and quality it is very over priced.  They have a sign saying 15% off your first time if you subscribe to text alerts, but they didn't honor it. They have a lunch menu but it's not on the tables, I had to ask for it.  Overall I wouldn't recommend it with tons of other options in the area.",

I went and stopped in this place for lunch the place had only been open for a little bit it took along time to get my drink order in. Food was ok a little on the bland side not a lot of spice. I do think the staff was friendly and I like the decor.",

Our server did a great job and we definitely enjoyed our lunch. We had a variety of dishes from fajitas and chimichangas to burritos and enchiladas. Everything was served piping hot and just as we asked. The sopapillas were great although we'd have liked some honey on the table in addition to what was drizzled on the plates of sopapillas.  When we get back to this area we'll visit again. Thanks for the great lunch!",

    "text": "This was my first visit to La Casa De Juana and what a great option this is for our neighborhood eateries. A Mexican restaurant of this standard has been missing from the area and what a happy find.   We were greeted immediately on a Friday night at around 6 pm. The place was beginning to buzz around then. By 7 pm, it was full and busy. There were families, kids, tables full of co-workers, etc. get there early to beat the rush!   Our server was an upbeat happy person. I recognized her and it took me a while to remember where I'd met her before. It was from a dining establishment near where I work. Same happy person that served me efficiently and happily years ago. HIatt was quick with service, has a great sense of humor, and even remembered me from years ago. HIatt actually made our experience more enjoyable. She is awesome. Ask for a table in her area. She'll take good care of you.   On to the food...it was surprisingly authentic. The menu was  quite extensive and offers everything from fish tacos to chorizo and eggs (at any time) to burgers. I had the fish tacos that came with rice and beans. The rice was a color I had not seen on Mexican rice. It was almost a greenish color, and it was delicious!  It was perfectly cooked and had a bit of peas in it, which I happen to love. The fish tacos were small but that was ok because that is pretty typical. The sauce was a bit spicy, but again, I love that in a taco. Oh, and the chips were thin and great tasting; not too think or greasy. The salsa could have a bit more spicy for me.   Prices were good and the beer cold. Colorful interior with very friendly, accommodating staff. A great nigh over all. We will be back!",

I had the shredded beef burrito with refried bean and rice. Shredded beef was just ok. It was moist/ juicy, but I would have preferred a little more depth of flavor and heat. It was also on the skinny side; for a burrito. The rice was ok. The beans were probably the thing I didn't enjoy the most. It was over cooked, watery, and mushy. It was also flavorless. The chips and salsa were great. Service was slow; despite there only being one other customer in the place. I felt this was expensive for what I got. I may need to try something else.  We'll see if I update this.",

On the upside, there's a large vegetarian menu and the make your own combo options offer a good deal of flexibility. The salsa is my absolute favorite. Okay, I really only come here for the salsa. The service is always friendly and fast and the restaurant is very kid friendly. There are also good daily food/drink specials. On the downside, the chili relleno is kind of hit or miss--they're often not seeded well enough. The other thing that's completely hit or miss is the accuracy of take out orders. It's more like a total miss. Our family jokes about whose order will be screwed up. Last time it was everyone's--and no tortilla or salsa in the order. Did I mention I only eat here for the salsa:(",

When I order and entree from a Mexican Restaurant they always give chips and salsa but not here.  The house salad described on their menu claims a spring mix but was just chopped romaine that was brown around the edges and went straight into the garbage.  Definitely overpriced on the salad.  Not sure if I will be ordering again from here.",

Their ingredients are all incredibly fresh and flavorful, especially the salsas and guacamole.  This is not your gloppy, chain Mexican food--Juana's has more authentic Mexican food that is packed with flavor.  Their margaritas, especially with the happy hour price, are exceptional, the best around.  Service is incredibly friendly, but they're still working out some of the kinks so be patient.  But it's so worth it!",

This is my first time visiting and I do plan to go back. The server seemed almost scared of me, which was weird. She was very nice and polite but seems a little timid. I'm sure she'll get over that. Chips and salsa were better than average. I had carnitas tacos and pollo tacos. Chicken was fresh and juicy as we're the carnitas. The server never checked back after I got my food which is a big pet peeve of mine. They are only two months old and I'm sure will continue to work through their growing pains. I'll come back and give them another chance in a month or two to see how they progressed.",

Both had very good flavor and presentation, but the enchiladas did not maintain their heat long enough to keep the cheese melted and the chimichanga was not crisp enough for our taste.

We ordered the vegetarian enchilada ( 3 different fillings - mashed potatoes, Spinach & Mushroom, Grilled Veggies. Surprisingly, the mashed potatoes was the best among the three) and Chimichanga. I personally did not like the food much since the flavor was definitely different than what I've had so far, it wasn't bad, but just did not hit my taste buds. Was kind of bland. The salsa was just okay. Sauces weren't very flavorful. The fillings lacked flavor. What I liked was the decor and the customer service. Note: They offer a 20% cash back deal on groupon. One star for food, rest for for customer service & decor.",

Lots of nice touches inside, cute decor that looks straight outta Rocky Point (my old hang out). I was thrilled to find a new, local , clean and yummy Mexican restaurant.   Service was very quick and friendly. The place is set up very well. Server took my order muey pronto. All good so far!  They have a very large, extensive menu-even offering Chicken Mole-which is rare. I figured I'd get enchiladas- one beef & one cheese-with  rice and beans, so I could test some of the staple dishes we all love.   The food came quickly- I hadn't even dug into the chips and salsa (the salsa looked great) yet.  First bite of chip was...very disappointing. They were kind of thick, bumpy and very cold. Not stale mind you. The flavor was bland and I tried one more-just to be sure. I prefer BAG chips in the store! Didn't eat  any more.  The salsa, which looked fantastic, was slightly watery tasting and...bland. ?? There was heat, but NO flavor. How is that? Hmmm...  Well, digging in to the cheese enchilada it was very good; the cheese WAS fully melted, which seems to be a common issue. The sauce was good, the portion good. I ran out of sauce before I got to my second enchilada. It was very tasty, but  I wish there had been a lot more sauce. The shredded beef enchilada was also very good, but less so with virtually no sauce. I would order a side of sauce if ordering enchiladas.  On to a bite of the rice, which I was excited to try. I love the Cilantro Lime Rice at Abuelos-maybe this is similar? Again, total lack of any flavor. It wasn't bad, wasn't good, just-bland.   The refried beans had the correct, slightly runny texture I love. They had a nice pile of white cheese on top, yum. Again, bland-It wasn't bad, wasn't good, just-bland.   I think I was figuring out that there seemed to be a total lack of salt. I'm NOT one to like a lot of salt. I never salt anything after cooking. But I think this is the issue-not sure.   There's a LOT to like about this cute little place, but I'm not sure I will come back. If the chips were good- well, I'd have at least that.  I'm giving it 3 stars for everything else that was SPOT ON - just not the food-to this girls taste.  If you're not so hot on REAL, maybe spicy Mexican food, you may just love their version of it.",

Last night our order was 100% so maybe they're on top of their game now. If you live nearby, they occasionally send coupons and have some daily specials. Also, yummy tortilla chips and salsa at the table to gorge yourself on if eating in the restaurant.  I've been here and orders takeout many times. Just tried the taco skillet and it was very tasty. I think it is new to their menu. I have also gotten their cilantro cream chicken more than twice.  Located in a shopping center with other well-rated neighborhood favorite restaurants, Juana's doesn't disappoint.",

The restaurant is small, but has a fair amount of seating. It's so colorful inside! You will think you have been transported to a cafe in Mexico! The Mexican music adds to the charm.  We were served complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were good, but the salsa was really good. Unfortunately, this was the only thing that was really good. It had a nice kick to it and lots of flavor.  I ordered Juana's burrito with chicken enchilada style. The chicken was very plain and bland and the enchilada sauce tasted straight from a can. No flavor at all. Plenty of chicken. Rice and beans on the side. The beans were more like a mashed retried bean concoction. I didn't see one bean. Didn't try the rice as I'm not a rice fan. My dining companion had Juana's burrito with carne asada and he had it the big way (All the stuff inside). No complaints there. We were the only people in the restaurant and the server rarely came to check on us. She was nice, but needed to come by more often. A very average restaurant. Not great, not bad.",

Always consistent and great food.   I usually go for the hard shell tacos. Love the carnitas, beef and chicken. Good salsa and chips. Horchata is yum. I always see the same wait staff and I've been going for years, which is a good sign.   The apple empanadas are creamy and muy bueno.",

There's salsa is absolutely amazing I could drink it by the gallon full. The meal always comes with chips and salsa and the staff is always super friendly. Later in the evening on Tuesdays they have some really great live music by a really sweet spanish man. $2 beers and $3 margaritas!",

I was searching out their other location, in Mesa, when I found this one actually nearly across the street from my house. Although not quite as big as their other location, this one has the same wonderfully painted bright walls, napkins, tables and decorations.  I agree with a previous comment about the veggie selection, I love when Mexican food restaurants have veg-friendly options! I got the Veggie burrito and it was pretty fantastic. Others in my group ordered the Street Tacos, chicken tacos and chili relleno and were also impressed. The margaritas are great (the strawberry ones are super sweet!) and the they even have a jalapeno margarita that we were too chicken to try this time around.   It was Mother's Day so we were really excited with a live musician began playing with a fantastic voice and mad guitar skills. What a great find!",

My friend had the green corn tamales and they were amazing. I ordered the pork and pineapple tacos which were delicious as well. Their rice is green due to the cilantro, and it has veggies like peas and carrots in it which is not something I'd seen in a Mexican restaurant before-- but it was really good. Our server was really nice and attentive, she kept our water glasses full and checked on us regularly.    Looking forward to going back to try out more of their unique menu!",

    "text": "If you're on McClintock and Elliot and want Mexican food, I could suggest about 8 places better than this one.  Went in after a movie, while wasting time getting my truck worked on across the street.  If you get your car worked on at that place (across the street) on a regular basis, you know, you have lots of time to kill.  I, like most, saw the add at the movie theater for $2 off and got the same bait and switch feeling once we got there.  Who's going to order an entree right after leaving a movie theater full of popcorn.  I'm sure it's all in the fine print on the screen, but who's reading fine print on a movie screen.  Whatever, it's $2.  The place smelled funny when walking in initially.  Kind of like a bathroom that's been cleansed.  The food is just OK.  The restaurant was empty except us, the waitress was very nice.  The menu said rib eye is an extra $2, but was informed it's actually $4.  My GF loved it, but I don't think she really knows authentic Mexican food.  She ordered the beef tamales lunch special.  I thought the maza was mushy.  Nothing amazing.  I grew up eating tamales from New Mexico, so maybe I'm used to it a certain way.  I ordered the Mexican pizza which was HUGE, especially for the price, even after adding rib eye, so I appreciated that.  It's literally the size of a large pizza, so be prepared for leftovers!  I shared it with my 10 year old, and we were full after a little over half.  I can only really compare the flavor to being very similar to the taco bell Mexican pizza, only with slightly elevated ingredients in black beans rather than refried.  I ate the leftovers for dinner that evening.  Woke up about 4am with a terrible stomach ache, and my GF was already up in the guest bathroom.  She called in sick the next day.  Not going to blame the food, because I'm not like that.  Just telling my experience.  Not bad if you're stuck waiting to get your car fixed, but can't suggest coming here if you have means of transportation.  I hate giving bad reviews.",

The food was fair but definitely not good enough to make up for the extremely poor service.  We waited 5 minutes before our waitress appeared to take our drink orders I can't mention her name because she never introduced herself and had no name tag. Our drinks were empty for over 10 minutes before we had to flag her down for refills. A party of 4 and we were there for 2 hours. Our waitress disappeared for about 20 minutes while we waited to order our food. Another 30 minutes for the meals to arrive and it was Luke warm. Flagged the manager down and he acted as if it was an inconvenience. I will never go here again and if asked where to go for good mexican food I will make sure to tell them that this is not the place to go.",

The decor is what separates this place from the many locally owned Mexican restaurants in the Southeast Valley.  Really fantastic Mexican artwork on the chairs, tables, and decorating the walls.  Even some interesting statues.  Plus, the food was very good.  I'm not an expert but I thought the Carnitas Chimi was excellent.  You get complimentary chips and a combination green/red salsa that was very tasty.  The service was prompt and friendly.  I think this would be a great spot to share with out of town guests, which I will be doing in the near future.",

They give you complimentary chips and salsa and their salsa is mild but very flavorful.  I love their colorful plates, glasses and colorful cloth napkins!!

I ordered the shrimp diablo which was INSANELY GOOD!  Tons of shrimp, peppers, refried beans, and cilantro Mexican rice.  The burros are awesome and of course my little man had a cheeseburger and he loves that as well.  Everyone talks about the margaritas on yelp and they should.::they are killer! Our waitress Hyatt was the bomb!  Told us about specialties and was so friendly and welcoming.  We never order desert and we had the caramel churros on hyatts recommendation and well worth the calories.  My final comment, LOVE the guitarist that strolls through the restaurant.

I can't tell you how many times we've dined at Restaurant Mexico, Serrano's etc. In an attempt to sway them toward some Mexican food that is above the mediocre requirements of some of the aforementioned names, we came to La Casa De Juana.   I must say that everyone was pleasantly greeted, our service was prompt and the food was quite good.   Carne Asada Burro Taco Salad w/Carne Asada Guacamole & Chips Tacos (all kinds)  The carne was well prepared and not full of gristle.  Taco salad shell was pretty burnt and dark brown, but everything inside was very fresh and had a nice balance (not overdressed). Guac had a nice flavor and the salsa was tomatillo and very good.  Tacos were done properly and had a good flavor.   Overall everything went well, they have cute glassware and the vibe is very Mexico! Flags, color and art even embedded into the booths. I'd say this is an excellent choice if you want some basic flavorful Mexican. This place is a family owned and operated establishment so I definitely support that!",

My employer moved into a new building a couple months ago so I have been using Yelp to find new places within the vicinity; not right next door to work.  A small group of coworkers and I regularly go out to eat a couple times a week.  La Casa De Juana on the corner of McClintock and Elliot was my choice today.  We walked in and were seated promptly.  It took about 5 minutes before anyone came to the table to offer menus or drinks; another ten minutes before our sodas came.  The waiter took our order and brought us our second bowl of chips and salsa.  My coworker had checked his voicemail when we first sat down and upon the discussion of wondering how long we had been there he confirmed on his phone that it was just over 30 minutes ago when we sat down.  I made the suggestion that we leave at this point since one of our coworkers was hourly and only had 60 minutes for lunch.  We waited probably another 5 minutes.  I stood up, put $5 down on the table to cover the 4 sodas, and we walked out unnoticed by any staff. This is a small restaurant which based on the only 2 staff that I saw, was way understaffed regardless of the size of the building.  The chips and salsa we all agreed were very good, but the service was simply ridiculously unacceptable.  Some would say that it wasn't the servers fault.  I say it was.  There are a lot of things that go wrong at any given moment in the restaurant industry and there are always options for the staff to try and make it better for the customer.  Even an apology for the lack of attention at our table would have been a start.  If someone had called out sick, where was the back-up, or management, to help cover?  Regardless of the reason, lack of planning is what caused this train wreck.  I don't know what it is about the Phoenix area that customer service is so low.  In my almost 6 years of living here I have never come across such utter failures in the industry and customer service in general, as often as I have here. Advice for anyone working in a restaurant that offers free chips and salsa: there are always too many chips and not enough salsa, and if you are busy and going to be unable to provide proper customer service, load your customers up on drinks, chips, and salsa, and there is a good chance that will appease them until you can.  One more thing, the way the menu is printed is horrible.  The wording is jumbled and with the font, print size, and color choices, it's obvious a non-professional or newbie restaurateur designed this menu.  It is hard to read and very busy.",

    "text": "Well, we liked it so much we returned on Saturday evening. I'm hoping that it is rarely used, but from where we sat you could clearly see a kitchen staff person using a dun, dun, dunnnnn... microwave. I guess I am crazy to think there should NOT be microwaves in restaurant kitchens, but alas, I saw it. And they had to correct my meal which came out on a very hot plate that I suspect was in said microwave. I'll be back, but I will request that only traditional cooking methods be used on my food. I'd rather have something luke warm than nuked. Lose the microwave, Juana! You're better than that.",

    "text": "Good luck being noticed at the door to be seated.  We waited for ten minutes for a server to say there will be someone with you shortly. A short five minutes later we were seated. Dinner was delicious. The low rating isn't because of poor food quality. It's the terrible service.   After eating we simply sat in our seats with credit cards in-hand. Over a half an hour later my wife spoke up since there was no wait staff on the floor. I'm actually impressed at the wait staff's ability to avoid eye contact at all costs. I just assume we're invisible, because there's no reason for their service to be this horrible.",
