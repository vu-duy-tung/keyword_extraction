He let us know that the green chile sauce isn't vegetarian, but recommended alternatives and made sure that we were okay with other ingredients in the food. I had the chile relleno platter and my fiance had the tamales. We each had a margarita with lunch, and the bill still hit under $30. Great service and great food; we'll definitely be back!",

It wouldn't really be THAT bad if it wasn't for the fact that EVERY damned thing you order is oversalted to the point of insanity. It's crazy! And my girlfriend is a salt fiend....she really loves it! But even she couldn't stomach that much oversalting. It seems to be the only trick the kitchen knows! And you can see the evidence on every table...completely full salt shakers, that likely never need refilling. A person would have to be mad to actually add additional salt to their food here. There are much better Mexican food places around- try Susie's Mexican cafe, up the street on University.",

I typically get the taco/enchilada combo, or a green chile chimi.  The margaritas are also pretty good.  I also always ask for the hot sauce with my chips and salsa.  I can't give it 5 stars because I have had better Mexican food, but this is the best I have had in the Phoenix area so far.",

It's almost overwhelming how many things are on there but I especially like the fajitas and of course the chips and salsa.The salsa is definitely 5 stars. I've gotten college kid servers who were cleaarly stoned, twice! My eating partner and I asked what one of their favorite things to eat was, and it was classic to see the look of delight in his red eyes, because he got to dispel his great wisdom of Rosita's fare on us. \"Dude...anything with the red sauce is the best...\"  I wonder if he hit the Cheeba Hut next door after a serious case of the munchies?",

They didn't have any 100% blue agave other than Patron, which I don't drink. The house margarita is Jose Cuervo which is headache city, so I ordered unsweeted ice tea. I was hungry so I ordered the Fajita Trio, consisting of beef, shrimp and chicken. When it arrived I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it, so much food. The beef was tough, the chicken was dry, and the shrimp was passable. The refried beans were runny and the rice wasn't very good. I could go on, but I think you get the picture. The entree was $16.95 and I didn't finish it, nor did I ask for a doggy bag. Rosita's Fine Mexican Food is misnomer. Oh yes, I did have to rush back to the hotel to go to the bathroom. You can figure out why.",

But then our waitress took forever to come over, and when she did she took our food order at the same time as our drinks. It took what seemed like forever to get our drinks! In fact, we finished a basket of chips without them! Then it seemed like things were smoothing out. Our food came and was amazing so we were feeling good about it. Then the wait for the check was probably 10-15 minutes! And I saw at least 2 other tables in the same position we were. There were only about 6 tables total there.

We each had a shrimp taco and a fish taco. The shrimp had been so overcooked that it was like chewing on little lumps of plastic. The fish had no flavor at all as it hadn't been seasoned.

I wouldn't want any Mexican food  aficionados to  miss out.    Rosita's has been our favorite for 25 years.  I remember our first visit and we saw some popular local sports figures there enjoying the fare.  The chips and salsa are the best and the drink glasses huge.   Nobody deep fries a chimi better, hot, crisp yet a bit flakey.  How do they do that?  And unlike other places, the green corn tamale is moist  and tasty and has some cheese on top...  perfect.   My wife likes the spinach enchiladas which are topped off with a white melted cheese, just great.   I go for the red beef tamale, tacos and enchiladas. What I'm impressed with is each individual item I've had at Rosita's is seasoned to perfection and a delight to the taste buds.    The place has been around a long time and shows its age somewhat.   It's not pricey and not cheap, but the food is the best.",

I got their Carne Picada which was 13.00 and 2 of their margaritas for 3.00 given that it was margarita Monday. My friends got a margarita too and a taco salad 10.95 and their fiesta bowl 8.95. Personally the food was only ok, I've had better at even Filibertos, definitely other mom and pop shops around. After paying, we sat around as I ordered my second margarita, which, by the way, is not strong at all, because after two I felt nothing. So we were chatting and the waitress comes back and asks us why we had only tipped her 7%. After going over, in detail, who tipped how much, she deliberated that my friend's bill of $11 and tip of $2 was around 12% and that my other friend's bill of $9 and tip of $1.50 was less than 7%. I don't know if she just sucked at math, or something, but I also added on a tip of $4 to a $20 bill of my own. She didn't see it like that and confronted us. First of all, I've eaten out a lot and I have worked as a waitress. You don't go an confront your customers basically blaming them for not paying you what you wanted and asking for more. Then after seeing me pack half of my food away, we left and I forgot my box. I turned around and went back in to grab it. Oh but they had conveniently tossed my box out.   The service, HORRIBLE. I would give it a negative if I could. The food, average. There are better places out there that are cheaper and more authentic. For a mexican place in Arizona, they could have done something that put them above the rest. I should have just gone to Cornish Pasty Co. next door.",

It really hit the spot during the warm evenings of Tempe.  As far as the staff goes, they're very friendly most of the time. It was only once that my server seemed very annoyed to have to serve tables. I haven't seen them since.  On the downside, I do not recommend the guacamole. It's similar to an avocado paste or puree, which is a bummer. It could be as delicious as everything else and is significantly worse. I had to mix in some salsa to enjoy it at all.

It could be updated, but it was clean. I would like the music to be softer, so that we could talk without letting the other customers in on our conversation. The food was amazing!  My friend ordered a lightly fried chimi, she devoured it. I wanted a Shrimp Taco Salad, not on the menu, but they did it for me anyway...Thank you Seth for a great evening.",

I was brought what looked like a Rositas Special, but it was far from it.  (btw a Rositas Special is a cheese crisp with green chili burro filling and folded over.  tasty).  On one end of the Special was melted Colby cheese (as original) but the other half was nacho cheese...aka Velveeta)...it was aweful.  The cook must have run out of shredded Jack cheese and used the nacho sauce in its place.  I complained, but nobody seemed to care.  To top off the meal, the brought us someone else's ticket...around $30.  Ours was half that.  Still the dive it was two years ago.  Cant understand why there were so many customers there.",

I had a combo plate with a tamale, a tostada, and a taco. All tasted like they came straight from the microwave, and the standard beans-rice accompaniment was typical from a box/can in taste. (I got black beans, and they were served in a bowl. They were *just* like you would get from a can, and pretty sure they were floating in the can-water which most people discard).  I guess you can say one thing about this place: It's an equal-opportunity employer. However, that's not a good thing in this case: The college valley-girl type staffs the joint and very loudly gossips in front of customers- Like, welcome to Tempe! As if!  Can't believe they charge more than 3 bucks for a plate for this stuff in good conscience.  Leave it.",

The half-price bean dip appetizer sounded good, but came out very runny and bland. We added a ton of salsa which only helped a tiny bit. Service was extremely slow. We wanted to send it back but nobody returned to the table until our dinner arrived. I asked for a side of enchilada sauce since there was so little on my plate. Finally something that tastes good! We mixed a little with the bean dip (which the waiter never took back) and it was finally decent tasting! Waters were finally refilled after asking twice and my soft drink was replaced with the wrong flavor. We didn't bother trying after that. Our waiter dropped off the check and didn't care that our food was hardly touched. He was not phased when we declined to-go containers either. The bill had a $2.95 charge for the extra sauce that we thought should have been included. We tipped according to the service provided and left. I think a major overhaul is needed here.",

Quesadillas are extremely lacking. Don't bother with them as you can get a better one literally anywhere else. Guacamole looks like runny green poo. Other items I've tried tasted pretty standard - not stand out or especially delicious, but edible.  Ambience: Large restaurant, always somewhat busy for lunch. Feels a bit dingy though.

We got there and were seated right away and got Lauren as a waitress,  she took great care of us! She even got assitance to bring exta chips and salsa which by the way was super yummy! Love their super size cups, never have to ask for a refill they're like a half gallon size, perfect for my diet coke addiction!  I decided in 2013 to enjoy life more so I ordered dessert first, the shortcake soppapiah, fabulous! I had the spincah enchilada with white sauce which was melt in your mouth goodness! I am a lucky girl because I sampled my coworkers lunch, a tasty bite of a chimichanga, and a fajita! Oh yes and I got a bite of the fried ice cream too, can you say pajama jeans, I needed them by the time I was done! Everything was fantastic, service included!",

It's a pretty standard Mexican food restaurant that you can find just about anywhere.  There is nothing standout about the menu, other than the fact they call their burritos \"burros\" which we were all pretty sure meant donkey.  You get the standard chips and salsa.  There is a big lunch menu with lots of options.  They charge for just about anything extra.  The server was good and made sure to take care of us before he got to a very large group so we wouldn't have to wait.  I wouldn't not come back here; but there are so many options that I wouldn't necessarily seek out this place either.",

The chips and salsa were okay, not great. The salsa was a pretty watered down and didn't have a lot of flavor. The chips were warm, like they promise, but tasted like they'd been sitting under the warmer a little too long.  I went with the burrito and taco lunch special; everything I was craving. I chose a chicken burrito and machaca taco. It was sorely disappointing. The taco was okay, but didn't have a lot of flavor; the burrito was horrible.   A thick, store-bought quality flour tortilla filled with flavorless, boiled chicken and absolutely nothing else. I had to cut open the tortilla and douse the atrocity that lay inside with the remaining rice and beans on my plate and a large helping of salsa just to make this thing palatable.  Whether Mexican, Italian, Thai or American, really good food is all about flavor. Unfortunately, Rosita's had none to offer.",

    "text": "I've had a mixed experience at Rosita's. The first time I came, I ordered their signature dish with chicken, that came absoutely swimming in melted cheese. I should've known, as Lauren V. noted, Rostia's serves Arizona-style Mexican food for the most part, which means uber helpings of cheese and sauce.  Wiser the second time I went, I ignored my waiter's advice to order another dish that seemed to be also a prime candidate for cheese drowning, and went for the fish tacos, which were quite good and served with a heaping portion of rice and beans.  I should also give props to the salsa, which was somewhat spicy but comes with extra hot sauce to add to one's own pleasure. While this seems common out in Arizona, it's a tradition that should make its way east, for sure.   I guess it all depends what you're looking for. Most of the dishes here seem to be in the \"cover with as much cheese and sauce as possible\" category. If that's your bag, then you're set. I, on the other hand, feel I need to choose very carefully here.",

They have decent deals on pitchers and oh so edible salsa (personally I like the hot version) but that is where the love affair ends. And even though we have gone to this spot several times, I wouldn't say that either one of us are fans. We go for the convenience.  I've tried several items on the menu and have to say I've never been particularly impressed with any of them. That's a nice way of saying I've never had anything here that wasn't done better somewhere else. I have spent years learning the nuances of what makes a good Mexican plate and if you are looking for something authentic, this wouldn't be my first choice. On the other hand if you are happy with an Americanized version and in need of cheap beer, definitely check it out!",

Their guac, if you order it, is fresh made and tasty.They have a few stand out items on the menu.  Albondingas Soup - mexican meatball soup. It's about $5, huge, comes with a plate of refried beans and warm tortillas, your choice of corn or flour. (Corn, bishes!#@) Delicious, filling, and relatively healthy.   Tamales. I love their green corn tamales. They have green sauce on them and some hot chile inside. Yum!  Short ribs. Yup. Grilled and very meaty. Delicious.  Enchiladas. Perfect.  If you like menudo, you can order it with or without the hoof. I don't like medudo or hooves, so you're on your own, but it seems popular with patrons who have that inverse make a run for the border vibe.  The reviewers who panned this place must have smoked crack before visiting. Or filed the wrong report at the wrong place. They can't be talking about Rositas!",

But others, usually when we end up in the lounge, can have large breaks where the server does not even appear in the room. I have witnessed times when the only server is the bartender who focuses on flirting with a few customers and leave the rest of the customers unattended for prolonged periods. Other times my table has waited close to 15 minutes for a refill.  If you go, try to avoid the bar. Either way the food is pretty darn good.",

When you go inside you'll immediately notice a sort of icky, midwestern grossness about it. Expect to see many corpulent men with military hair cuts. They will be squished tightly into their booths shoveling massive quantities of cheese covered food into their mouths. Try not to let that spoil your meal.   Those guys go there for the same reason I do. When you sit down you get a basket of warm chips immediately. Their salsa, which is made with oregano, a much neglected herb in Mexican cuisine, is my favorite. I'm usually in a food coma from eating so many chips before my burrito even arrives. You will not leave hungry. It's good hangover food. If the wait at the over-rated Harlow's diner across the street is too long then try Rosita's instead.",

Pretty much, I only eat there when I'm either extremely hungover and don't want to drive any further than I absolutely have to or when I'm in a hurry because it's so close to my house and the food comes quickly.  Basically, this place has got two things working in its favor:  1. It is extremely close to my house 2. Damn good salsa.  However, this is a Tempe Hotspot for some of the ugliest and weirdest people around, including some old drunk dude I always see staggering around University and Hardy with the same look of bewilderment.  One time, I'm pretty sure he was being thrown out because everyone looked mad at him and he walked out with an air of indignance.  Another time, I heard a different old man cough, then fart, then cough again.  These are the kinds of people you will see at Rosita's.  Overall, the food, though not great, is not bad.  Yes, it's greasy, but if you're hungover, you'll feel better.  It's fine for what it is.  I really enjoy the chimichangas.",

The other bigger room was cooler, but far from comfortable.  I am sorry but not having good air conditioning in Tempe/Phoenix is unacceptable.  Figuring we could manage the heat, we ordered guacamole to start.  I am an avocado lover and consequently eat guacamole all the time.  I have NEVER seen guacamole like this before.  It looked puke green and was completely pureed, the consistency of liquidy sour-cream.  In addition to the guacamole, we also ordered a quesadilla.  How hard is it to make a decent quesadilla? Whatever the case, Rosita's quesadilla was cold, hard, and seemed like it was just reheated from the day before.    We paid without eating 98% of the food.  I will never return to Rosita's.

The beans and rice that came with the plate were pretty average. I ordered water with lemon to drink and the water tasted terrible even after squeezing the lemon into it. Overall I would not recommend this place if you like good Mexican food.",

    "text": "Never again rositas!! My husband and I ordered some food for take-out Monday night for mindless football grub. We ordered two carne asada burritos, one with black beans and rice, and two beef tacos a la carte. The tacos were $5 a piece, and we're tiny! I'm sorry, but for $5 I could buy a much better taco at a gourmet taco restaurant. The burritos were also small and over-priced at $9.95. The black beans were an absolute joke; they literally emptied a can of beans into a container, with all the fluid that should be discarded when rinsing beans. Neither of us took a bite of those, and they ended up right in the trashcan.  The chips that came with our order were completely stale and chewy. The meat inside the burrito was tasty, so they can keep one star. Next time I want crappy Mexican food, I'll head to fillibertos and save myself $30.",

I would say avoid the Sonaran Enchilada only based on the fact that the sauce was bland, I come from a Hispanic family so I know when something is supposed to have a great flavor, and the Enchilada was not of them. The next thing I will complain about is that I ordered a breakfast burrito. I had no idea that the Chorizo was going to cost me an extra $5 dollars to add on to it. The egg was cooked like an omelette, and was not scrambled, and then the chorizo was spread across the burrito. So not only was it underwhelming but it was also bland. One last redeeming quality of this place is that they had a good happy hour.",

When you go, you have to try the pan de leche dessert - so good. Drinks are very large cups, and even if you manage to drink the whole thing, servers are attentive and quick to refill. Food always comes in a reasonable amount of time and right when you sit down a server is at the table with a large free fresh basket of chips, fresh pico salsa and hot salsa. The Horchata is wonderful, the food is wonderful, the margaritas are great, and the happy hour is such a good price... regular prices are also pretty awesome for this area of town. If you want some great authentic Mexican food, go to Rositas!",

I had a cheese enchilada with white sauce on top with rice. The rice was good and the white cheese sauce was tasty. My husband had a chicken enchilada with green sauce and he liked his meal okay. The inside is really outdated. But if you're looking for a lunch spot that isn't drive thru, this place will do the trick.",

My mom wanted hotter salsa and Emily made their regular salsa hotter with a yummy spice and brought my mom the spice to make it her own if she wanted! Prices were amazing, food was amazing, service outstanding. Definitely our new favorite AUTHENTIC Mexican place!",

Was looking for \"authentic\" Mexican food, had done some research before coming to Phoenix and what I remember looking up for Rosita's did not match what we were served here. My husband's \"tamale\" was nothing more than just shredded chicken wrapped in a corn tortilla. Arroz con pollo was delicious, but not like a traditional arroz con pollo, comes with only one tortilla (doesn't appear to be homemade either), and a weird steamed cabbage/carrot/corn salad on the side with absolutely no seasoning. Chips and salsa was mediocre at best. Someone's review says they are homemade chips, I highly doubt that. Haven't gone back and figured it out but pretty sure we were overcharged as well but couldn't read the ticket to know for sure.",

They charged me $7.90 for extra carne asada in my flipping chimiChanga after our server told me it will be around 2-3 dollars for extra and then a 2.50 charge for their white sauce on my chmimi on top of the chimiChanga dinner price like really even MACAYO's doesn't charge that much and that's coming from a Latino. When I asked about the price when I was paying, the girl literally told me it's $7.90 because it's assorted already and she sounded like she was trying to make an excuse on the spot.

I'll try again in November. Hope it was just a fluke and not the new 'policy .  February 2019, went for my usual #39 on the lunch menu. Same as usual, the food is good but the size of the burrito has shrunk from a jumbo burrito size to a smaller regular burrito size. Guess that's how they're not raising their price. Service is always excellent as I try to sit in Betty's serving area in the dining room.  I'm giving a 5 star because of the service, 3 for skimpy serving on the burrito. Oh well .

The waitress had the personality of a wet noodle with no smile, short answers, and not friendly at all. She wasn't unfriendly, just like I said...a wet noodle.   The chips and \"salsa\" came. We tried the hot, but the waitress was right in calling it smooth. It was blended, had little flavor, and was literally and figuratively cold. As if it was in a fridge. The regular salsa had little flavor as well.  Then came the menu which was set up nice until I saw the prices and the size. The prices were easily half again as most places with portions half the size of the better and cheaper restaurants.   We got a \"bean and jalapeno\" dip that had no flavor whatsoever. We mixed in the \"hot\" sauce in an attempt to salvage it. It got a little better.   So I ordered my usual go to at a new Mexican restaurant. Flautas with refried beans and rice. The rice was ok. The beans actually had good flavor, but the tiny little flautas were bad to the point of I just stopped eating anything all together.   Then on top, they over charged me!   This place was a disappointment and not worth your time and money. I would have done better with a bean and cheese burrito at a shady gas station! I suggest doing your pallet a favor and keep going down the road...",

    "text": "My family frequents Rosita's and I can see why it's been a Tempe staple for so many years.  The chips and salsa are excellent and worth the trip alone.  I always get a black bean burrito enchilada style and it is the best black bean burrito in town.  The servers are really attentive and friendly as well.  I notice that many people seem to think it's overpriced, but I don't agree.  You can get a cheese crisp at happy hour (which is all day Sat/Sun) for $2.50.  My burrito on the lunch menu is around $6, less than most other similar places.  I do agree that the bathrooms are not the best, but I don't pass up good places simply because of the bathroom.  I'd miss many great dives in larger cities if I did that.  Overall, I think you'll be happy with your meal and the service provided at Rosita's.",

The waitress looked unsure but said yes. When the food came, there was a definate meaty taste so I asked her if she could make sure it was veg. She huffed back to the kitchen and returned saying it was. I threw up that night and my friend threw up the next morning but didn't know what to attribute it to.  For some ridiculous reason (probably the location and a margarita craving) we came back a few weeks later. I ordered the same thing and again asked if it was vegetarian. The waiter, Seth was very polite and said he would go check. When he came back, he informed me that their enchilada sauce is NOT vegetarian and apologized.   I won't be back for their bland, uninspired food and rude (except seth)  wait staff.",

    "text": "I remember trying Rosita's a long time ago and being pretty disappointed after a number of my friends had hyped it up pretty heavily...so today, as my co-worker and I debated over which Mexican place to try, I decided to give Rosita's another opportunity to win me over. For starters, the chips and salsa were pretty average. The chips were a little thicker than I prefer, and the salsa (at least in my opinion) tasted like a thin tomato base mixed with water. Very little spice, and not much taste at all. I ordered a shredded beef burro and a chicken taco combo plate because it was one of the best deals on the menu at $7.50, and I enjoyed the shredded beef...perhaps a bit dry, but it still had a decent flavor to it. The chicken, however, gave me flashbacks to my bad experience at Manuel's...although not quite as awful, it was very bland and lacked any real redeeming qualities. I still don't get how a place can f-up chicken! Jeeez. The spanish rice I had on the side was pretty standard, but all in all this was another pretty \"bleh\" dining experience. My dining companion just sent me an email to inform me that his bean burrito was already trying to make a comeback, I'm just glad I went double rice verus rice and beans. I give it two stars because we had a good waitress who was fairly attentive and because the shredded beef was passable.",

She would bring me different dishes pilfered from the kitchen after each shift. Life was good. Anyway, I can report that nothing on the menu appears to have changed much since then. It is still hearty Sonoran fare. The salsa and red sauce have bite, the chips are warm and the burros are well stuffed. I do, however, have one gripe. My dinner arrived at the table with a most unappetizing helping of pre made soylent green looking goo on top of it. For a $12 entree, they really should have stepped up and rocked the fresh guacamole. Other than that, it is an A-OK place to grab a filling meal.",

I don't know who would even run a restaurant with gross food , what's the point in running a crappy restaurant. The water tasted like sewage even after adding 6 lemon wedges to it. A Mexican restaurant that is too cheap to provide customers with bottles of habanero sauce or even tobasco for that matter. The food tastes so horrible they should at least provide that.

When I used to come regularly, I'd always get the Arroz con Pollo and it was so perfect.  The chicken was slow cooked so the meat was tender with so much flavor, the cooked vegetables and rice that accompanied were also delicious on their own without the chicken, it was a perfect meal.   I was excited to come back and I naturally ordered the same thing.  When it arrived I was so disappointed.   The juicy well prepared chicken had been replaced with long skinny strips of precooked chicken, it wasn't even edible.  The medley of vegetables had been replaced with just cabbage and the rice was the only edible item so that's what I ate.  We had ordered some guacamole to share and out came this mint green pudding.  It tasted like a tub of sour cream with a small amount of avocado put into the blender.  The margaritas were good though.",

Then i ask if salsa is included with the cost of chips, to which she replies no, salsa is extra as well. I hung up.

The lukewarm to cold tacos were not crispy, and came 3 to a styro box.....waste of a box, and more trash. I asked for NO chips and salsa, but I did not get any hot sauce either! I called, and a manager is supposed to call me. I only called to complain about the lack of hot sauce because it was before I ate the sub par tacos and was extremely disappointed. The chef that made my tacos the week before needs to teach the chef that made them on the night of 10/13/2015 how it is done! I really hate when food I have had before is totally different when ordering the same thing again.               UPDATE: I spoke with the manager the morning of 10/14/2015, and he was very receptive, and said he would speak with the kitchen manager. He also comped me a taco 6 pack which was very nice.

I want to say from the start that in the interest of fairness the service was great, the place is attractive, and (since I know this place has been around forever) it must appeal to a certain clientele who like this middle-of-the-road type of Senoran food.  And 3 stars means A-OK according to Yelp.  So the flavors here work if you are in a pinch, but there is nothing that really wowed us.  Have you ever ordered a cheese crisp and wondered why there was so little cheese on it?  Have you ever dipped your chip in a salsa and thought, \"I could probably chop up a better salsa than that\"?  Nothing was bad, but our combination plates contained nothing that would bring us back craving something.  Taste is subjective, and it's a comfortable hang and the servers are attentive, but if you know, it all comes down to recipes, and we found the flavors merely adequate but not fantastic.",

    "text": "This isn't bad if you want cheap and convenient and greasy Mexican food. I live in walking distance and a few friends and I go sometimes. Their happy hour is cheap (dollar off margs and 1/2 price appetizers). The margarita is weak and corn syrupy though. The interior is run down, and that can be charming if a place has out-of-this-world authentic and fresh food, but this is sub-par and have had much better cheap Mexican. The salsa is fresh and delicious, and that's what it mainly has going for it. The chips are usually a bit stale. They douse everything in cheese. The best item I've gotten is the spinach enchiladas, which I recommend if you're hard up for Mexican and end up here. I go if I'm bored and don't want to drive or bike anywhere -- convenience, but I would rather make my own Mexican at home (which is sad that as a Kentucky boy I feel like I can do better). I expect so much more out of Mexican food places in this part of the country and have had mind-blowingly better than this even in Kentucky.",

Our 1st restaurant down the street never got around to serving us, so we came to Rosalita`s figuring it might have authentic Mexican cuisine.  It was brutal.  The service was atrocious, as one poor guy was working both the bar and the \"lounge\" area which had about 8 tables full.  He was pleasant, but completely overwhelmed.  The food itself tasted as if it had been left out all day and simply reheated.  The chips were stale and the salsa tasted suspiciously like the crappy Ortega stuff you buy in the supermarket.  My shrimp dish was so disastrous that I only ate half of it because I was afraid it might make me sick.  The shrimp were overcooked to the point of turning into rubber, and the sauce was nauseating.  The rice was overcooked and dry, and the green salad of lettuce and carrots was steamed!   This was without a doubt the worst mexican I have ever eaten in my life.  My wife thought her tacos were bland, but much more edible than my shrimp, even though the cheese was not authentic, or tasty at all.",

The guacamole is neon green without flavor, the food swims in grease, and the beans and rice are often cold by the time they get to the table.  There are better restaurants just a few minutes away.",

The food is generally pretty good but on multiple occasions I've gone there at later hours and noticed the chips to be extremely stale to the point where you can't really eat them. The salsa is good but not my favorite. The entrees I've had are always the best part though, which it always should be. I typically get the stacked enchiladas with shredded beef, which is good but could have more flavor, with rice and beans. On other occasions I've had a chicken chimichanga which was also good. Compared to some other Mexican restaurants, I can say there are other tastes out there that I prefer.   If they could make sure to have fresh chips and salsa the entire time they're open, I'd give them at least one more star. The food is good, but isn't out of this world amazing. I will be returning and plan on being a repeat customer thanks to the proximity of the restaurant to my house, and good service.",

The guac was less than desirable and looked like it came out of a bag and the sour cream didn't seem fresh . The fajitas didn't have any sizzle to it upon arriving at the table. The enchilada was ok .. Nothing fancy . The server didn't seem like he even wanted to be there .. This place needs a huge makeover! Better lighting , refresh the menu and update the decor .

My friend got a combination plate that had chili rellenos, tacos, fried something else, beans, and rice that looked like a heart attack waiting to happen. He had me taste the chili rellenos, which was good, but I don't think I could've eaten a whole plate of that. I got a carne asada beef sauteed with onions, peppers, tomatoes and spices. It was quite bland and indeed very lean. When I ordered it, the server said it was her favorite dish. In hindsight, I never should've taken that as a good sign, cuz she's skinny as a stick and probably doesn't eat half of the time!   Sigh...usually I'm so good about ordering the most delicious item on the menu. This was a pretty big fail.
