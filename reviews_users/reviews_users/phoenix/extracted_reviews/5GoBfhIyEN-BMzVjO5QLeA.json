After i walked around outside in temps above 114 degrees for 45 minutes ttrying to find them, when i finally did they asked me when i came in what can we help u with?? Well i said it is dinner time i would be here to get food duh??? . that was not the way to greet a paying customer that was gonna spend 15 dollars on their tiny little burger and fries. Then when i asked what was taking so long for my server to bring me a menu?? A manager with blonde hair came over and said u need to leave. And if u come back here i will have u arrested. I was 86ed from there. But for what??? They were the ones being rude, slow, and unprofessional.",

I notice that the prices have gone up. The Burgers looks a little smaller as well. But, Angela made it a great meal regardless.  We got Sangria and she even brought us water with lemon and straws. Anticipating our needs before we even asked.  Burgers were good ,cooked as we liked them. With everything we wanted. THe sweet potato Fries were cold when we got them. So our server got us another plate right away. She checked on us several times and was very quick with the refills. One of the s=best servers we have had anywhere for a long time actually.  One this I noticed is the TV that used to be in the floor in the waiting area is gone. Just something I thought I would add. Because, I always thought that was an unusual thing to have there. But, a bit unique .",

    "text": "I stopped going to Red Robin many years ago because of the poor service, but on Saturday night my wife convinced me to try it again. Needless to say it hasn't changed except the prices went up.  At first I thought that maybe I was wrong the server arrived quickly took our drink and appetizer order. The appetizer arrived hot and the server checked in, told us he would bring more chips. Never saw the chips but I was still chewing when they cleared the appetizer dishes away.  Then came our burgers I had a tavern burger and my wife had the royal Red Robin. I upgraded to a \"big\" burger on the suggestion of the server, a big mistake. The patty makes the quarter pounder at McDonalds look like a half pound. The only thing I could was a nasty BBQ sauce no cheese no tomato not even the bacon. My wife couldn't finish hers because the egg was too runny, if you know what I mean.  Meanwhile I waited for our server to bring a second round of drinks we ordered when the burgers arrived and more fries. Needless to say the fries must be with the chips we never got. A manager stopped by and asked how things were, after telling him he wanted to reduce our bill, but we had already checked out. Our server-did show up with drinks when we were getting up to leave. All in all why people think this chain restaurant is worth going is beyond me save your money and find somewhere else, preferably locally run",

A must for me is the rye bread must be grilled on both sides with cheese on both sides. The waitress assured me it was grilled but they only grill one side because they only put cheese on one side. Sad thing is the grilled side was just soggy. I think they need to take the patty melt off the menu. Don't market yourself as gourmet burgers and try to pass that off as a patty melt.",

Second, we order an app and it was served with a dirty plate. When I asked for a 2nd plate that as well was dirty. I gave up and just ate with my fingers.  Third, I ordered a chop house medium rare and got a chophouse medium well. Sigh! My husband got the A-1 burger which he thought was ok. Over all we did enjoy the fried mushrooms and fried zucchini. The waiter was friendly and the service was fast. The water taste like tap water and the beer was good.  I don't think id return here :(",

I've been to this location a few times when visiting family & friends in AZ and everything has always been just fine. Burgers, salads, appetizers, etc. are all pretty standard. Every time I've been here the service has been fine. Now that I think about it, I think each time I've been here it's been with friends who have small children. So yeah, this place is good at accommodating kids.     Normally I'd give a place like this three stars, but I'm bumping them to four because of the bottomless fries. If you order anything on the menu that comes with fries they'll just keep bringing them to you when your out. The last time I came here me and a friend were waiting on another friend who was running late (because of her kid) and we asked the waitress if she would bring us fries while we waited since we knew most likely somebody was gonna order something that came w/fries, and she had no problem doing so.   Also, even though this isn't a place I would necessarily seek out for watching football they do have several TVs if you happen to be here when a game is on.",

The manager (I forgot her name) came out with an iPad and literally went over every item in full detail that was gluten free. She was able to find a great meal. 1/2 through our meal the manager came back with a website and stores that my Niece could buy this special gluten free breading.

A few times I have been they take forever to get your drinks and take your order other times it's very quickly. With any restaurant this can happen. I always get the whiskey river burger it's my favorite. Bottomless fries? Yes please! Also love the tower of onion rings and sauces that come with it.   If your into a big burger sign up for the loyalty card and get a free one on your birthday!   P.s. The red robin mascot is creepy in my opinion sometimes walks around the restaurant and makes me uneasy.

This was such a rare occurrence to receive excellent customer service that we told the Kitchen Manager that Ben was doing a good job. We should've told the manager, but we didn't see one. Hopefully, the Kitchen Manager will tell the General Manager. Obviously from looking at previous reviews, no one checks their Yelp reviews.

I don't mind sitting at the bar but when your 9 months pregnant, climbing the really high chairs and booths feels like Mount Everest. They could of just sat me and my boyfriend at the plenty of two person booths they had or be more considerate and sat us in a place where I don't have to get helped up.  I don't like the way the bar area is set up, your literally right on top of the party next to you which makes it worst when your 9 months pregnant and barely can fit in the long booth. No one wants to be that close to each other unless its a group of friends. Like if I put my elbow down its nearly touching the person next to me and you can even join in the conversation if you wanted. That setting is great for an actual bar if you want to socialize and bring people home but not when your enjoying dinner with your boyfriend.   I will be back cause I love their burgers but I rather sit in the kiddie section where I actually have room to move around.",

    "text": "After a couple other mediocre experiences here, my wife and the 3 kids decided to give this place another go.  We were immediately put off by the fact that every table had a tablet type device intruding on our table.  My wife instantly joked that we were going to need 3 of those things before seriously asking if we could have it removed from our table to which the answer was \"no, sorry.\"  Hmmmm.  We have no choice but to be forced to eat with our family with this tablet thing with marketing messages, games, etc staring at us.  Just nothing I really care about when I go out to eat dinner with my family.  I go out to get away from those things actually.  That alone is enough for me to not go back.  Technology is cool and all, but this is just plain intrusive.  I really felt sorry for the two tops.  The things are pretty significant in size and are just plain awkward if you ask me.    The two burgers we got weren't bad but certainly didn't justify the price tag.   Specifically asked for a cheeseburger for our 5 year old daughter.  When it came out without cheese, we paged the server with our annoying tablet, and when she came back we explained that the burger was supposed to have cheese.   She apologized and said she would fix it and left the burger with us and headed for the kitchen.  I wrongly assumed that she would be bringing out a new burger with cheese (like we ordered).  However when she returned with a cold slice of cheese on a plate, we were so surprised that we just laughed it off.  At that point, no need to complain to anyone else.  When you factor in the price, it's just not worth it.",

I generally do not go to any Red Robin because the service stinks as does the food but this time the fries were hot and plentiful and kept coming and my order was right and hot. I was amazed and might even go to Red Robin again but if it's like usual the place has good days and bad days. I hate paying for bad service and poor quality food. With Red Robin the great service we had this time will probably suck the next time. Then I will stay away for another year until someone talks me in to trying it again.",

That being said, I made a costly mistake this last time I found myself here for lunch: I ordered a salad and chili. The chili was amazing, spicy and full of flavor. The salad, on the other hand was bland and tasteless, even with their balsamic vinaigrette. I can't hold it against them, though, because I knew full and well that Red Robin specializes in burgers. Do not stray from their burger menu - no matter how good the pictures make the other food look!!  Whenever I've ordered a delicious burger (I've never had a bad burger here), I've always had consistently fast and courteous service. No matter how busy the place is, the wait staff ensures that your drink is never empty, your appetizer is delivered quickly (highly recommend the onion ring tower), and your food is cooked to your exact specifications. They are also great for medium-sized groups and their bar is perfect if you want to watch your favorite game with a moderately-priced beer in hand.",

I love the variety of choices you have as far as buns, toppings, fry sauces, etc. I love their drinks as well - milkshakes, refillable root beer floats, strawberry lemonade... all good!   You have to sign up for their royalty card, it's free. Buy 9 get 1 free on burgers. Also, pretty much every Tuesday during NFL season you get a free Tavern Double with the purchase of another burger. Score!   Service is ok. Place always seems clean. Would recommend for a good burger for a decent price - especially if you are hungry :-)",

Advertised at 416 calories /55g protein it's a been a good choice for me when out and about and wanting to keep lunch on the lighter side and It's actually delicious. I come here just for this dish.   The service is quick and convenient at this location. I sit in the bar and I am usually in and out in 30 minutes but also full and satisfied and not feeling guilty when I leave.   I love the on table kiosks so you can simply pay when you are ready to leave. Amy the bartender is nice and they always send me with and Iced Tea to go!!  I don't think you'd normally associate Red Robin as a possible healthy lunch spot so I figured I leave this review. Also, If you travel like I do they are easy to find.",

The restaurant is clean with Red Robin kitschy decor. Parking is plentiful and close to the door.  The food: I had the soup and sandwich ($10.99). I had the chicken tortilla soup. Flavorful, but served barely warm (hot soup would have been nice). The sandwich was a Caesar chicken wrap. OK, but I was still hungry after I ate it. My daughter had a cheeseburger with steak fries. She said it was OK. My grandson had the kid's meal cheeseburger, apple slices, and lemonade. He ate it, but did not seem enthusiastic about it.   As we left, my daughter bought some gift cards for a friend. They have a special where you get a $5 gift card if buy a certain amount of gift cards. They forgot to give her the $5 reward card, and she had to ask for it. You don't get them from the server or the seating hostess (even though the kiosk for them is right next to the seating hostess). You have to go to the bar to get the gift cards and children are not allowed in that area. If I had not been there to watch the 4 month old and 4 year old grandchildren, she would have had to pass on buying her friend the gift cards. Crazy how that works.",

But hey, the setting might be okay since you are in \"holding-hands distance\" with your neighbor to embrace each other while you embark on a horrible burger adventure.   The first red flag was when we ordered and the server did not ask how we wanted our burger cooked. A \"gourmet\" burger place that doesn't ask what temperature you would like your burger? Word? Apparently the \"new\" Red Robin's patty is something similar to what you would find at McDonalds.  It seemed there was only one person working the bar area on a Friday night. This made for 10 minute beer service and 15 minute water service. I guess the \"new\" Red Robin calls for less servers.  Seemingly the new corporate rebranding has changed the food and service. Bring back \"old\" Red Robin!",

My wife ordered a GF burger, no onions, no cheese and a side salad instead of fries. I ordered the prime rib dip with fries and cole slaw.  We also asked for silverware and napkins since they were missing.   Our order arrived in about 10 mins, still no napkins or silverware. Got those after five more mins. My wife's burger had onions (no cheese) but the biggie: her salad had croutons!  Really?  The server had even asked if she preferred a GF bun or if she was gluten allergic. I SAW him write down allergic!  My sandwich was tasty but they were obviously getting rid of stale bread. I know the difference between toasted and stale too. Good thing I had the au jus.   Lastly, my endless fries and bottomless lemonade?  Never saw the waiter again until he brought us the bill.   I'm done with that Red Robin. Obviously they don't care.",

My previous review criticized how stingy Red Robin was with their bottomless fries. I suppose it really is just hit and miss with the server/waitress you get whether they're prompt giving you your fries after you order, but they have been great about bringing fries quickly for the most part. This keeps my wife and kid happy while we wait until our meal comes.   I can't say I've had a bad experience at this location in the past 2 years I've been coming. Sometimes they seem a little understaffed or their server/waitress gets slammed in their section during a rush, but this has never affected my experience or my experience with my wife and kid.   Food selection has diversified and my pescatarian wife has been pleased with their selection of the seafood. She enjoys the salmon entree.   I prefer the whiskey BBQ burger. It's always been my favorite and it comes out great every time. I do wish they added more BBQ sauce on the burger.   My kid likes their mac and cheese and loves the mandarin oranges which they graciously refill for us.   Red Robin also has a great rewards program that I utilize all the time (member since 2013). Free birthday burger (which you can claim at any time during the month, not just on your birthday), 10th burger/entree is free, coupons in emails, etc. It's worth getting and the credit for your 10th free burger/entree don't appear to expire.   If you're looking for a good place to take your family, business colleagues, or just craving a burger, Red Robin has always been satisfying.",

    "text": "Last night I really wanted Red Robin, so we went there. And I ordered one of my favorites. Cutting into my burger like I usually do; I noticed it was kind of hard to get through the middle. When I finally got through it I noticed a white layer that looked funny. So when I lifted my bun I realized there was still paper wrapping for the cheese on my burger. We asked for the manager, the waitress that we asked was rude. Then the manager came over asked what was wrong I showed her and she took it fast, without saying much; not even an apology for the BOH. Then came back and told me they're making me another one. Still, no apology and my waitress didn't even come over to ask if anything else was wrong or be empathetic either. I don't need sympathy. But to not show any care for a customer like that for something like this happening. No. And on top of that we still had to pay for that burger. I'm so disappointed, I love Red Robin. Never had a complaint before but last night the service and food quality was extremely poor.",

The waitress and managers claimed they could not find my payment and printed out pages worth of payments to prove me wrong.   Come to find out, I was also overcharged. The waitress charged me for another tables bill, then claimed she had no idea how that happened.  Once they found my payment, the gave me a lame ass excuse and apology.. Like that was going to make up for the embarrassment and harassment they put me through. Not to mention, I was offered a free dessert.  WTF makes you think I want dessert after what you just put me through.  Just refund me my money and I will not be back.. Horrible customer service.",

As a vegan who use to love going there, I got up and left last night after waiting over 20 min to even be seated, and about another 5 min before the waitress even saw us. They replaced the Boca burger with some quinoa and oats patty, to most likely save a dollar, but it was definitely the wrong decision. I would rather pay a little more and eat a Boca burger than some random thing they tossed together and called a burger. My family will NOT be customers anymore unless they bring the Boca burgers back.",

This place is really hit or miss, we have found 1 out of 4 visits we either have bad service or bad food. We have had bleeding burgers served to us, kid's mac and cheese with only 5 noodles, cold in the middle crab cake burger, spilled oranges all over a grilled cheese (rendering it soggy and inedible by my 3 year old) and have had a handful of bad servers. But seeing as how we have been here over 30 times, a few bad experiences do not out way the good ones we have had. And anytime we have had something bad happen they have ALWAYS made it right.  My go to's here are the bonzai burger, fish and chips, fish sandwich.  I do not recommend the crab cake burger  Give them a shot, and if something isn't right you need to speak up because management is always willing to make it right for you!",

And the meal was a bit messy so I asked the manager for more napkins (when the wait or was taking too long to check up on us) and he have us ONE more napkin each. Me and my friend practically laughed out loud. And for the manager to have done that. The only disappointment was the obvious clinging as of napkins.

I had to listen to my kids whine for 15 mins that they couldn't play the games on the tablets that were on the table.  4.

And proceeded to not get refill on my drink. For a nice and solid 45 minutes. He gave me my appetizer and my whole meal. But God forbid Jake the server couldn't refill that drink. So I  had sat there with both the appetizer and dinner sitting in front of me getting cold because he couldn't figure out how to take a cup and refill the thing. You have two jobs. Take people's order and refill their drinks. It will be a god damn cold day in hell before I return to that location. Absolutely pathetic.",

Slow service, never get refills - you have to get the server's attention for that - most of the times they are missing silverware and you have to ask for that too.  Just today was there with co-workers and my cobb salad came with no egg (what kind of cobb salad comes without hard boiled eggs?) and my friend had to call the server and ask for a refill of his drink and for more fries. I was never even asked if I wanted a refill. Previously, at this same location, burgers have come without dressing, or not per request - so this isn't a one off experience. We go out as a team here once every couple of months.   In spite of all the poor service and food, you are now \"shamed\" into tipping 20% with their new electronic self-pay device on each table - and you get to do all the work.  I don't think we will be going back here for a while, I am tired of racking up $80 bills for four people with poor service and sub-standard food.  I might as well take the business elsewhere - they really don't care and have enough traffic coming through at this location to not need to care anyway.",

Also I like getting the jalapeno coins with cheese sticks before all that. This is a place I like to go with friends, dates, family and before sports games. The waitress Nicole in the sports area and Lexy at the bar are helpful. I came to watch the Cavs Celtics playoff game and they made sure to take care of me. Also check for the waitress Jess for busting her butt as well as Hannah at the bar and the manager William. Sara is also an awesome waitress. I want to give a special shoutout to the waiter George. He went above and beyond with my service today!",

We were seated after a short, 5 minute wait, and everything was pretty darn perfect! The host who seated us was very friendly and pleasant, the waitress (I wish we had her name) was exceptional, all of our orders were hot and exactly as ordered, and we were offered the bottomless fries (which we gladly accepted!) several times without asking. It is a kid-friendly place so if you are looking for a quiet, intimate dinner, don't come. But if you are wanting good food, good service and a good atmosphere so you don't have to keep saying \"shhh\" to your kids, this is it! We will definitely come again.",

Last Monday we stopped in and learned that they had changed up theirs menu, and to our dismay, they changed the quality of the beef used to make their burgers.    We were seriously disappointed with the reduction in the quality of the new burgers.    The $1 reduction in the price of the burger is not adequate compensation.   Congratulations Red Robin, you went from having exceptional burgers to mediocre ones.     We can only hope other customers make their displeasure known and Robin Robin reverses this disastrous decision.",

Yes I realize you can order more, I just didn't understand why they gave us so little from the start.   Then when he had ordered the burger, the waitress asked pink or no pink and he said no pink, guess what it was definitely medium rare.   Finally, our waitress went to fill up my raspberry iced tea and came back with regular iced tea. Which is annoying because the raspberry was more expensive than the tea.   Giving them two stars because of the quality of my salad.",

    "text": "I was in the Tempe Marketplace area with my girlfriend when we were trying to decide what to get for dinner.  While neither of us craved anything in particular, we remembered learning how Red Robin is known for their bottomless fries.  We figured tonight was the perfect night to test this out.  And well...they sure were bottomless!    There was a bit of a wait for several parties ahead of us though we found a nice table near the bar area to avoid the wait.  The service was good, and we decided to order a Whiskey River BBQ Chicken sandwich for me, and a Simply Grilled Chicken for my girlfriend.  While we were certainly looking forward to chicken (we know...Red Robin is a burger place!), we were REALLY looking forward to the fries.    Initially, we were each given a very small serving of fries though as we went through them quickly, without our asking, our server brought us a basket of fries (which were later refilled once and upon being asked again if we wanted more, we finally decided we were finished with fries...for a long time!).  The chicken sandwiches were fine but nothing too special.  In fact, my Whiskey River BBQ Chicken had to be sent back as the onion strings and the BBQ sauce were both missing, but that was quickly remedied.  They also have a birthday club that sends out regular discounts during the year.  Definitely tell them it's your birthday if you're celebrating, and in addition to the birthday burger, you may even get a sundae.    All in all, a nice experience, and we certainly have had our fill of fries to last a while.",

I think that the burgers at Red Robin have a distinct flavor that people might get tired of over time if they have too much of it. There might also be a slight charred/grill flavor to these burgers as well. I also had the bottomless fries with my meal. I think the fries can be hit or miss sometimes, but most of the time they are cooked right - where the fries are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I also like the variety of complimentary sauces that come with the fries. I like the ranch sauce the best, and then the ketchup.  We also ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  Solidly good but nothing amazing.  The bottomless fries are good if steak fries are your thing.",

The staff said sorry and gave me a new salad without chicken. They didn't seem worried with my reaction of sadness and gave us the check. It was the worst meal of my life.

(We waited around 15 minutes, which isn't long for a place like this by my standards - especially on a Saturday evening). What I like about this place is all the decor. Plenty of things to look at while you're waiting. There's even framed pictures on the ceiling. Of course, the best part of the experience is the food! I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious.   The only bad thing was that our server never asked if we wanted more fries. We actually forgot until we walked out of the restaurant asking each other, \"Hey, wait a minute, wasn't this place supposed to have 'bottomless fries'?\" So I guess it's kind of our fault and maybe they don't give you more fries unless you specifically ask for them.  One thing to keep in mind is that you might have to shout to everyone at the table (and to the servers) since it's pretty noisy in here. It's a very casual dining experience so it's what you would expect, but don't expect to be able to speak in a normal \"indoor voice\" here.",

Also we were seated at a table that directly under a AC vent but that wasn't his fault. I'm sure with technology being as advanced as it's gotten there's has  to be a better way to cool than to have a single frigid cold spot",

I have used them several times for catering purposes and while I am bummed they don't deliver, it is always great to know that my large orders will be ready on time when I show up to pick them up.

    "text": "I've been to this Red Robin a few times and went again tonight and I can honestly say that I've never had a bad experience there.   The menu runs mainly along the gourmet burger/sandwich/salad route which is usual for a chain restaurant that is family friendly. I've mostly had the burgers and once had a salad and everything has always been prepared to my liking.   The burger menu has quite a few options to it and they are pretty cool with letting you substitute whatever you like on them. I usually get the 'Sauteed 'Shroom and Swiss' burger and it's always been just what a mushroom Swiss burger should be. Lots of melted gooey Swiss cheese and lots of fresh mushrooms which they saute in a garlic butter. Since I need to watch my carbs (that old blood sugar thing going on) I usually get the burger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun and get steamed veggies instead of the all you can eat fries. I have tried the fries at times and do recommend them but usually go with the veggies.   I have always had great service. Always greeted promptly by a smiling server who never lets my drink go empty. The food always comes out in a short time and is always served hot.   It may not fit everyone's bill....but if you're looking for a good burger at a good value I highly recommend it.   And FYI....for the holidays they are offering a gingerbread shake which sounds great. Someday while doing some holiday shopping over in Tempe I'll have to stop in for one.....on one of those days that I am REALLY watching the carb count.",

My husband had never been, so we decided to go.  We were greeted with open doors by the hostesses, seated quickly and greeted by our awesome waiter Dustin super fast.  He made us feel welcome.  I got a peach iced tea and I drink a lot of tea.  Thank  you God for Dustin!  He never let my drink get empty and when he brought out a new tea for me, I never saw him he was just that fast.  My husband and I were like where did that tea come from.  Awesome lighting fast Dustin to the rescue!  I ordered the Whiskey bbq burger  medium with sweet potato fries, and my husband got the Whiskey bbq chicken with onion rings.  I loved my burger and the fries were a little salty but good.  My husband liked his onion rings, but the chicken was a little dry.  I went safe and got a burger because that is what they are known for.  He also got mint fudge shake, which was pretty good.  Overall, the place was nice, the food was good for the price and the waiter was AWESOME!  Best service we have ever received.  Thanks Dustin!!!!",

We were pretty hungry and we thought that Red Robin would hit the spot.  I was looking forward to the Salmon Burger.    We were seated immediately in a booth.  We looked through the menu and decided what we wanted to eat.  After five minutes, no one came to greet us.  Waitresses kept walking by, but no one stopped to say hi or get our drink order.  We waited five more minutes, by that time we were looking around to see if we had a waitress.  Still no one...we decided to leave and go to In-N-Out Burger.  I was really looking forward to a Salmon Burger, but I don't like bad service much less no service.  The location was not busy at all and there was no reason from my end why someone couldn't come up to us and let us know what was going on.  Those other waitresses passed by us and even looked right at us.  They knew we weren't getting served.  They could have possibly kept me there if they acknowledged that we were there and would locate our waiter/waitress.  I know this is one incident, but it really puts a bad taste in my mouth.",

When we were being seated we were walked to a dirty table and told to wait while they wiped it down; not the most appetizing site prior to eating out. We sat down, ordered our drinks, and waited, and waited, and waited. When the drinks finally came we were very ready to order and quite hungry. My girlfriend and I got a burger to split, and she also got a side order of fruit. Then we waited some more. A lot more. After about 30 minutes (not an exaggeration) we finally were able to grab out waitress as she was passing by and we asked about our food order. She said \"It should be ready any minute now\". She then hurried back inside, grabbed our food and brought it out to us. The food was not hot. The food was not warm. It actually felt cold! I suspect it had been made in a timely manner and then was forgotten about. Now, I am not one to complain about food, I love food, but this was really frustrating. I asked the waitress if I could speak to the manager. He offered to bring us a fresh burger and fries and when he brought it out to us I very kindly told him what had happened and he apologized and offered to pay for our meal. The manager gets 5 stars, great guy, but the waitress really made what should have been an enjoyable outing quite frustrating. Other than that, the food at any other red robin is really great!",

Our waitress was very uninterested in us being there.   We ordered our drinks and some onion rings. The onion rings come out as a tall stack on this tall metal object, I was leaning forward talking to my friend when the waitress tries to shove the onion rings onto the table damn near taking my eye out. She was close enough that I felt the heat of the onion rings on my face.   Aside from near blindness, they were good.   We both ordered grilled chicken sandwiches, and both agreed that they were the most god awful grilled chicken sandwiches there could be. despite the gobs of sauce on them, the chicken itself had no flavor...and was rubbery.  I had some sort of pesto cibata chicken, the bun was soggy on one side. Soggy bread makes me gag, its the worst. Wet bread ::shivers:: they put a pesto sauce on it, some sort of diced tomato concoction and then a very odd flesh toned sauce. No clue. I took two bites off the none soggy side and that's all I could bear.   I will say though, the french fries are freaken Yum! That is what saved me from starving to death. My friend doesn't like confrontation so I didn't send it back, if I was there with anyone else, this meal would have sure been sent back.",

I was so uncomfortable.  The food was amazingly tasty as usual and all five of us were really happy with the meal and the service, it was just way way too cold.   I would definitely recommend heading here for one of the many awesome gourmet burgers or the fiesta fajita salad, but BRING A JACKET!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "Confession time. I don't really dig burgers that much. I mean, they are okay, but I rarely crave them.   I also hate eating at chains. Especially noisy ones that welcome children and the servers wear \"flair\" and have group sing-a-longs for birthdays.  So why have I eaten at this Red Robin countless times? Well, a friend of mine as he puts it \"do love him some fries,\" and Red Robin gives endless fries until you can eat no more. We've had many a carb coma to attest to this fact.  But aside from the potato gluttony, the food is actually pretty good. Far better than I expect most chains to be. The menu is extensive and you can customize any burger the way you like it. My friend always gets the cheeseburger with a substituted Boca burger and I usually have a turkey burger variation of some other listed burger. The staff is always friendly without being obnoxious and very accommodating.",

    "text": "I am a fan of Red Robin, my family eats at this location at least once a month, mostly because my husband is addicted to their all-you-can eat fries. We are vegetarian, so the reason they're so great is because you can get a Boca patty OR Gardenburger on any of their burgers. Options for veggies? Crazy!   Also, absolutely fantastic for kids because: 1. food is served very quickly 2. they give you balloons 3. bright lights! + distractions! = toddler stays in her seat.  The service is super friendly, as well.  I wanted to give it 3.5 stars though, because...  The Whiskey River BBQ burger is our favorite, but it is not always served perfect, with the fried onions served perfectly crispy, and when they're soggy...yuk. Also, quite frequently the Boca patty is totally cold in the middle, or overcooked and thus totally dry and chewy on the outside. Finally, their drinks are terrible! I forget this a couple times a year, pay $8 for a premium margarita, only to regret the fact that I didn't just get a shot of premium tequila because the drink is weak, small and way too sweet.   So...a great place for families, a good alternative for Vegetarians in this town, and I probably shouldn't eat there so often, so I could avoid all the disappointment.",

Love the idea however need to perfect that just a bit for my liking.

My former favorite was the bonsai burger, but now I love their Southern Charm - bacon, onions, bbq, etc. yum.   My son's favorite item is their refillable root beer float.    A couple of things that need a  little attention - the on-the-table bill-pay tablet does not always work, so it took us a while to get checked out.  And, apparently our rewards membership expired (we don't always remember to use it), but yet we still get their emails, and we had to have a manager give permission to use the discount that was sent to us via email.  So corporate - avoid confusion!! If you are going to \"expire\" our membership, then take us off the mailing list so we know.",

Double check. Triple check.   My burger was ordered with lettuce instead of a bun. When I opened the container it was literally JUST TWO PIECES OF MEAT WEDGED BETWEEN LETTUCE. I'm being literal. No onions, tomatoes, siracha onion straws, no pickles. Nothing. Two pieces of meat and some lettuce. What the heck? My boyfriends ghost burger 1) had tomato despite being ordered without and 2) had no ghost pepper sauce?!?   I called to talk to a manager because I've never encountered such a messed up order. He apologized, kind of. He mostly said how he didn't know how that would've happened. He also said he would refund $6 which, imo wasn't enough but I appreciated it anyway. Here's why I'm writing my review.... not only was our order ridiculously messed up and a HUGE waste of money... we were charged in full. Yep, they never actually took anything off of the tab.   Normally Red Robin is consistent quality but wow save your money and grab a burger from In & Out instead!",

I ordered fish fillets and fries, and received fish and shrimp with fries. I asked for no tartar sauce, and it was still included. There was small pieces of cheese stuck on the bottom of my fish.  My boyfriend got the A1 peppercorn burger with NO tomatoes, and there were still tomatoes on the burger.  There was only 1 seasoning packet (the salt for the fries), when there were 2 entrees which was odd.  The only good thing about our meal was the quick delivery and our delivery man being very friendly.

Normally, I wouldn't consider writing a review for a large chain restaurant, but I made an exception today. Primarily because I was impressed by the menu.  We've visited the Tempe Marketplace location before and the service was less than spectacular. We were prepared for another long lunch hour so when JC arrived, we ordered our food along with the drinks. Crisis avoided! JC's service was much better than our previous experience. Plus, the table top pay stations made it a breeze to split our check and pay.  I didn't have time to fully explore the menu, but I liked the updated selection of burgers. There was some seriously creative stuff going on there. Speaking of creative... I selected my lunch from the lobby promo sign. The Bee's Knees is a fried chicken breast with a \"syrupy\" glaze served between two Belgian waffles (see photo below). I had really high expectations, but it ended up being just too sweet. One of my buddies ordered the same sandwich. He and I agreed that it could use a kick of spice. Points for creativity though.  Regardless, the bottomless fries were delicious. Kudos on the new menu Red Robin. I'll have to come back and try one of those new burgers next time.",

Then as time went by we figured out what we wanted to order. We were seated along the edge of the restaurant, but not in a forgotten corner. To my right there was a couple and to my left another group. Both the couple and the group were  being served, however the waitress never once acknowledged my friend and I, not even asking to fill our waters. Several times she came to check on them, walking right past my friend and I in doing so. After almost 45 minutes waiting we decided to go elsewhere. Nobody even acknowledged that we were leaving, though we passed several servers and the host.",

I was surprised to see they have bottomless sweet potato fries! For an additional of .79c you get endless of this side! Happy girl! I'm not sure when did they start having this cuz we don't really frequent this place but I'm glad they have it, I have the sole reason to go back to the place again.  But still only an A-OK rate though, the service was going great until I asked for another order of s.potato fries it took them forever to bring another one, we're already ready to go the time she brought the fries was the same time we gave our card to pay.

    "text": "Mediocre at best.  This place is a wonderful example of American cuisine gone wrong.  When a restaurant relies on salt and mayonnaise as the staple flavor profile, the food is well, boring (i.e. Chipotle Mayo).  Red Robin is a burgers and fries type place, fried everything.  Fried everything should be DELICIOUS!  What is missing?  The presentation of all the dishes is fine, it is the utter lack of flavor that was so disappointing.  Had a burger and onion rings, and while there was nothing particularly wrong with it, it was completely forgettable.  The atmosphere is very corporate.  The service is designed to be good, but falls flat, again too corporate (waiter virtually up your ass when you don't need him, and not around when you do).  In summary, there are way better places to spend your time, money and calories.  We gave it a shot, and it wasn't our cup of tea.  If you like it, more power to you.    I usually do not review restaurants until I have given them several chances and tried different items, but I won't be returning.  I just can't bring myself to eat here.  The food is edible, but while I was eating, I actually wondered to myself why I was eating it.",

I prefer to sit at the bar to avoid being distracted from my delicious food by the \"oh so lovely kids.\" The bartenders are always Awesome with the specialty drinks Red Robin throws out every so often. One thing I love is that they are cool when I ask to try one of the special drinks and they make a mini.  Although I would recommend the Mug Drafts!",

If you're in a crunch for time you can also call ahead and order your food and it will be ready by the time you are seated at your table.  I would recommend this if you have a shorter lunch break.  My favorites items are the Whiskey River Burger, Whiskey River Chicken Sandwich and Whiskey River Chicken Wrap.  I guess I'm a big fan of their BBQ sauce.  Not to mention they have the best ranch amongst all restaurants. Lastly, I recommend the berry lemonade to compliment the food.  This is also bottomless so drink up and get one to go!",

Someone on the phone said I could use it as long as I bring my id, which I did. The manager didn't do anything about the issue.

So about an hour into this experience we finally got our food.  The food was not bad.  Then came this stupid electronic box thingy on our table.  We were supposed to be able to request refills on it, we could not.  For whatever reason they were not in there.  We were supposed to be able to split up our bill.  We could not.  The gadget was not taking the credit card,  It was not giving a receipt.  All we wanted to do was stop and grab a burger before we all went our separate way home.  The food is what we have come to expect with Red Robin.  Not terrible.  The service and experience at this location was terrible.  I would not do out of my way for this location.

    "text": "Went here a few days ago with the family. We've been to this Red Robins a few times (birthdays, events, casual). A lot of their customers usually consist of the College crowd, rarely any \"families\" that eat there because of the mature-atmosphere.  Waiters/Waitresses are nice, they're always on top on refilling your glass, asking if you need anything, the stuff you see in basically every other sit-down restaurant.  When I went, I had their new Bourbon Burger, it wasn't that great, it tasted like Chili's (ugh) burger with fried onions on it. Except the Red Robin fryers actually remembered no mayo or tomatoes on my burger (unlike Chili's), so I was very happy about that. The Bourbon wasn't very flavorful, it was messy, but the picture already shows it's not a clean burger to eat! Once I added the Red Robin \"special seasoning\" on it, then it got really good - halfway through the burger... I did not get the \"unlimited steakfries!\" special... but I don't know if it's because our waitress was busy with a large group of college kids who were there for a birthday and simply forgot. My sister had the Royal Red Robin (with a fried egg on top). She liked it, but nothing to write home about.  Previously, before the burgers, I would order the Fish and Chips, the fish are nicely fried (can't burn deep fried stuff though huh, lol!) and crisp. The Fish itself are very large pieces, so you get the bang for your buck on this item! I would recommend sharing it with another since you get four pieces of fried fish.  I would defiantly come back to this Red Robin though, don't get me wrong, but I would suggest going with a more adult group that doesn't have a lot of children in tow... It is more popular with college kids after-all.",

    "text": "Came on a Saturday night. We sat at the bar because the dining room was packed and noisy. The nearby Ruby Tuesday was closed so we ended up here. Both have good burgers. I am burger eater my husband is not so thats why we were going to hit up Ruby Tuesday. Suprisingly his chicken salad was delicious. Very large portion, fresh ingredients. He had enough to take home for the next day. Plus of our experience was the onions ring were hot and fresh and his salad was good.   Negatives. Poor customer service at the bar. I don't really like sitting at the bar but husband does because he feels you get faster and better service. Usually that is the case. Not on June 8. We ordered some mai tai and long island to have with our onion rings. No problem with this but mai tai was lacking on the dark rum. I then sampled the house red, which was horrible so upgraded to the $9 for a 6oz cabernet. First glass on it had a hair hanging off. Grossed out but it happens. I politely showed the bartender and she toss the wine and poured me another 6oz glass.  No apologies or anything else. Food came, we ate and asked for to go containers. To go containers had a hair on it. Yuck...had to ask for another one.   Had we had all these hair problems in the beginning, we would of not eaten there. Both hairs were long and dark. Did not match the lenght or color of the bartender. So not sure if poor cleaning or staff just not pulling hair back or wearing hair nets.   Food:  overall 3 stars. I got the Premium Bbq burger. It comes with grilled onions versus onions straws. It was ok. I only ate a fourth of it as I wasn't super hungry. My husband ate the rest for lunch the next day.  I did slam my fries with some ranch. Always bomb!    Checkout: At checkout, I let the bartender know I am apart of the loyalty club and it is also my birthday. She says \"were you expecting to get that burger for free\" well actually yes. I was then informed that the Premium burgers dont count. Ok, can I just pay the difference in price. It was only a 3 dollar difference from the other bbq burger. No, and by the way no empathy and real care about my dilemma. The money was not the issue. We spent over $60 at a burger joint. I like red robin and have never had a bad experience. Well this one, I wont go to again. Its ashame because, I like to go to this one before a movie. I was just shocked at the poor customer service when I pointed out to you, two different times nasty hairs. The least she could of done was ask a manager for an override. Or with first hair, give me a complimentary 9oz pour. I saw you discard the previous 6 oz without a care so you could of added an extra 3 oz in my paid glass. Any hoo.   We probably would have had another drink or dessert but after the 2nd hair we were done.   I did get to use my loyalty Birthday burger voucher at the Stapley location. Can I tell you a world of difference. Please see that review. I live the same distance from both but work near the Stapley location. This will be my go to location. No thanks on Tempemarket place.",

I only waited about 10 minutes before getting a small table at the bar.   Pros: food was good Fries came out hot  Drinks were good   Cons:  I had to ask multiple times for a refill My waitress (who was nice, but overwhelmed) had too many tables and neglected a few of us smooshed together.  Wait time for food was longer then usual  I was given the wrong check, I had to wait another 15 minutes to check out.   For a Saturday evening, I get that they are a busy location. I just wish they wouldn't overload their servers so they can give better service.",

Lol sheesh he'll thank me one day. So for dinner we cams for our free meal. If I remember correctly, I had the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. So hubby and I do more local eateries versus chain restaurants. So it has been years and I mean years since I've had a burger from Red Robin. I was pleasantly surprised. They certainly know how to fix get your mouth watering. And surprise, surprise, bottomless fries. So if you're in the area and looking for a quick bite. Don't hesitate. Thank you for the freebie Red Robin! We'll be back again!",

My boyfriend and I came during an off time one weekday after the flat iron hike because we felt we deserved a big meal and the endless fries.  It was honestly pretty busy so we sat in the bar area  in one of the booths. We were greeted right away by the waitress and brought waters. We were starving, so we ordered right away: I got the Burnin' Love burger and he got the Whiskey River BBQ burger. I really enjoyed my choice. The fried jalapenos had the right amount of spice along with the pepper jack cheese and smokiness from the chipotle mayo. The salsa, lettuce, and tomato provided a freshness to the dish that was desired to balance the fried portion. The burger itself was moist and cooked perfectly. The fries were a great accompaniment and our waitress provided refills promptly. My boyfriend enjoyed his choice as well. It is one of his go-to options because he loves the bourbon-infused BBQ sauce and the crispy onion straws.  Next time we'll have to save room for a shake!!",

Fast forward 10 years, and I don't eat meat. But then I saw an internet ad for \"Best Veggie Burger Chains\" and Red Robin came up! So my now wife and I headed over to give this place another try.  This review is late and I can't remember the exact burger we ordered. But basically...nearly ALL their burgers can be substituted for a veggie patty. That's great. All those tasty fixings can be accommodated for a hippy like me! To make it even greater, they offer half bun, no bun, lettuce bun...all kinds of healthier options.  And don't forget their fries. They are waaaaaay good as well!",

I usually order the Clucks and Fries or the Whiskey River BBQ chicken burger with pineapple! Both come with their bottomless steak fries. Usually the food is good and if it isn't, simply ask for something new and they usually take it off your bill.   I've only had one bad experience here with the service. A waitress was very rude and grouchy to the point where we spoke to the manager and got a new waitress. The manager was nice and also gave us a free stack of onion rings.   Keep in mind this is a large chain restaurant so don't expect it to be a fancy place with gourmet food. It's what you'd expect out of RR",

I had to push my leg off the side of it to fit under. Other than that it was typical Red Robin atmosphere (loud,lol) but slightly cooler than usual (temp about 70). They had raised their price on their bar burgers from $5.99 to $6.99. All in all I won't complain as it's inflation and unlimited fries (when you can get the waitress to come back). The drink price also went up to $4.45 per fountain drink.... makes me wish I was a camel as that's the only way to get value from that.. Burger was over cooked but decent. I get my fries extra crisp so those were hot and tasty.   Hope this helps your choice",

    "text": "My fiance and I went to this location for dinner, our receipt lists the time as being 8:42 p.m. He had been to Red Robin a few times, but this was my first, and most likely my last. He hadn't had any problems the times he's been before, but everything about this visit was awful. First, we asked for a booth and we were sat way on the end by a door, and it was only a half booth, the other side were chairs... it felt a bit like being in a hallway. I used the restroom before we ordered, and it was not clean. There were two open stalls, one looked clogged, and the other one I used did not have toilet paper installed. Luckily, there was a wrapped roll elsewhere I grabbed first. One of the sinks was leaking and constantly running and there were paper towels overflowing all on the floor. When I got back we ordered water to drink, which tasted awful. By 2014, I would expect restaurants to know how important it is to people to have filtered water. Fries were brought to our table, but the server did not clear the empty tray, someone else did as they were walking by, and our \"bottomless\" fries were not refilled. We ordered, and waited. The food seemed to take a long time for what it was, and our server again, was not the one to help us. Someone else brought out our food and our server was nowhere to be found for most of the evening. She did not check in on how the food was, and I had to wait a long time for her to walk by so I could flag her down with a question. I asked if I was served the kids meal of what I ordered - I ordered the battered chicken and shrimp - which came to the table looking dismal, and quite frankly ridiculous. I have a photo I will post. It is a giant plate of fries - as if they are the main part of the entree - and just a few small pieces of chicken and shrimp tossed on to the side as if they are the garnish. It looks laughable in the photo. When I asked if this was the kids meal, she said no it was the adult size, and did not offer to bring out anything else to make it more of a meal. Both my fiance and I were flabbergasted that you would charge $12.99 + tax and tip for this - it was overcooked, the shrimp were rubbery, and quite honestly, I could have bought this at the grocery store for wayyyy less money and made it better myself. My fiance's drink ran empty most of the night, as did his fries. We waited for our check to come, and the only time our server came back quickly to the table was to collect our money and her tip. Overall it was one of the worst eating-out experiences I've ever had... The chicken was half the size of the chicken strips at Applebee's, just an FYI, and they charge about half what you charge... they are double the size there and they serve it with three pieces.",

Every time we go on the weekend it's always busy as expected but they should always have more staff. We went on my husbands birthday on a Thursday and had terrible service. Wasn't busy but server was lacking. She forgot to ring in my margarita, had to mention and got it right before our meal. We also didn't have no napkins or silverware and didn't get any until halfway our meal. All I asked for was my pesto on the side of burger and it wasn't even brought out. Let's just say I didn't expect for dinner to be this bad for special occasion. Not the best place to go if you're trying to eat and be out of there. Expect to stay an hour and a half to two for a simple meal. Least at this location.",

Everyone helps each other, there is no server-to-server competition.  Wow!  My friend and I ate here at night a couple weeks ago, and we were just laughing and having a good time.  We didn't feel rushed at all while we were there.  If it's one thing I don't appreciate at a restaurant, it's when I feel rushed by the server; I may as well have ate at home.  Not here, though.  They are very patient, kind, and provide excellent customer service.  Management, I hope that you realize how great and rare of a team that you have there.  Servers, keep up the wonderful work!  I hope you know how valuable and appreciated you are by your customers!  :)",

Not a lot of places have mushroom burgers so I was super excited to try it. When our food came out my burger was cooked to my specifications, but the taste of the burger and the mushrooms was very dull. I felt like there was no flavor or pizazz to the burger. With all the mushrooms, onions and cheese I figured this burger would be making my taste buds jump around. Instead it did the complete opposite. I ate a few bites and decided to just visit with my friend and munch on my fries. My fries were cold and kind of mushy. When I eat french fries, I like them crispy and warm. A lot of my friends love this place, so I will give it another try, just not a very good first impression. Maybe if I order something else I will have better luck! I usually try to give new places more than one shot just on that occasional off day we all have every now and then. :)",

When we went to pay the server took our card and proceeded to take other orders before ever even running our card.  So once again we waited and waited.  She was standing at the bar after that and then finally went back by the kitchen got some drinks for another table and finally brought our card back...nearly fifteen minutes later.  No exaggeration. I will choose another Red Robin next time.",

I've had them all from in n out to The Hat. Long story short I know a good burger when I eat one. At Red Robin I ordered a Red Robin classic cheese burger with an onion bun, crispy straw onions instead of regular onions, meat cooked well done and also my must have ketchup. After taking my first bite I knew that this was the burger of the year. This burger was perfect in every aspect.  The bun to meat ratio was perfect, the onion bun also gave me a softer more flavourful alternative from your standard sesame seed bun. The crispy straw onions added a nice texture to the burger as it complemented the lettuce, tomatoes, relish, mayo, and ketchup. This Red Robin is taking the crown for best burger of the year in my book. I look forward to getting back to California and trying the same burger to see if quality and taste are comparable. And last but not least I would like to thank my waitress Kayla M. for serving us she is really nice, friendly, and if you get a chance check out this Red Robin.",

(for those who can't figure it out by the address being Tempe not Chandler) So I had  never been to a Red Robin before.... and I had a free birthday burger so I wandered over to Tempe Marketplace and ta-da! We were seated immediately wherever we wanted. Our waitress, JJ, was really nice. I was surprised to find out that my birthday burger also came with a side! And what was really awesome is she gave my boyfriend a basket of fries for free! The burger itself was huge.... I had lettuce, tomato, provolone cheese, avacado and bacon (I had the bacon guacamole burger but got avacado instead of guacamole due to boyfriend's onion allergy) Well. As you probably can guess, the burger was quickly devoured and I had sweet potato fries. I couldn't even eat the first refill because I was so stuffed from the burger. The fries were good though, but the sweet potato and the regular steak fries. JJ made a great suggestion of dipping the sweet potato fries into ranch. Great experience and look forward to coming back.",

    "text": "Companion and I wanted burgers and decided to go to Red Robin. We had been to this location previously and had been satisfied, but this time we were quite unhappy.  Things started badly when they tried to seat us in the bar. Companion is handicapped and sitting on high chairs in the bar makes no sense. One would think the person seating us would notice the cane, but seemed oblivious to the situation. When we asked for a different place to sit, the look on the persons face said it all - we were considered troublemakers.  After finally getting a seat that we could use, we sat and waited and waited and waited. Eventually, the server Natalie showed up. We ordered drinks, and they had to be sent back because they were wrong.  After quite a while Natalie showed back up to take our order. We ordered an appetizer of Artichoke Spinach Dip, when when brought out was still ice cold in the center and had to be sent back.  Next we ordered our main course. Companion ordered the Fish and Chips with Mac and Cheese, and I ordered the Mushroom Burger with Garlic Aioli (75 cents extra!)  When I was asked how I wanted my burger I asked for it to be as rare as they could make it. Instead, I receive a well done burger with a tiny cup of Aioli sauce on the side. For those not familiar, Aioli is basically nothing more than mayonaise with some garlic added to it - hardly something that should cost extra.  I had asked for my fries to be well done. Instead I received flacid, greasy fries. After I had eaten more than half of my burger a different waiter noticed that I had not touched my fries and brought me fresh, hot, crispy ones that were just what I had wanted.  For a $42 bill, this was totally not worth it. I felt I wasted my money.  For purposes of authenticating this review, service was on 4/9/2015 @2:36 in the afternoon at table 13/1 on ticket 30014 with an incorrect number of guests listed on the ticket.   Red Robin prints on the check to tell them how they did. I'm telling them they did poorly.",

Guests with Christmas themed names had the opportunity to dine at the establishment and receive a free chicken sandwich. My first name is Holli-Noelle. My middle name is Caroline. With the anticipation of trying the new chicken sandwich for free, I got in my car and drove to Red Robin.   Upon arrival at the restaurant I asked the host if he needed to see my ID to verify my name. The host said that wouldn't be necessary until I placed my order. After sitting down and ordering a drink, I explained my name to my waitress. She stated that she would need to check with her manager. A man who had all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile. I overheard the manager explain to my waitress that my name, \"just happened to be Christmasy\".   When my waitress returned to my service, she reported that my name did not qualify for the promotion because it is not related to Chris Kringle. Naturally I was devastated...because my name is Holli-Noelle Caroline. The insult hurt like a snowball in the face. If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if I was born on Christmas Day, I could have purchased dinner for every guest in the restaurant that evening.   I'm disappointed in the Scrooge-like stance Red Robin has on offering a free meal to someone with so much Christmas in their name.   Happy Holidays,  Holli-Noelle Caroline L.",

We were seated within 15 min and after looking around, I kinda wondered why it took so long since the restaurant was not that busy. The waitress was super friendly and was quick to get us drinks and our 4 appetizers ordered... The good experience ended there. The waitress was still friendly but seemed to take forever getting our order, and she got our order she was gone... we were all hungry and kinda wondering what was taking so long for the food. It got to the point where I was gonna ask what the hell was going on, he had waited about a hour for our food. They finally brought out our food and there was a total of 9 people with us... 1 person got cold soup (sent back), another got cold chicken in her salad (kept the salad and after waitress asked if chicken should be hot brought out new chicken), I got the smoke and pepper burger and my bun was completely soaked thru, and fries were soggy as hell. I asked for a new bun but figured I should see if the patty was even hot... Nope, the burger itself was cold... I sent my burger back and everyone ate in the meantime while my food was being remade, and I was eating after everyone was done. The waitress was still friendly and apologetic, and the manager was helping her and didn't even stop to apologize or explain. We got our check and there was nothing taken off. Im not big into complaining too much about our check so I just paid it... This will be the first and last visit to this Red Robin....",

My favorite so far is the Guacamole Burger with bacon --- yum!  Always done right!  The place itself is a zoo with a carnival on the side; babies crying and kids running amuck.  If you can't handle that then I say please stay away!  I always hangout at the bar where there are no kids allowed; good call!  The drinks here are pretty basic and each wait staff has their specialty drink you can order -- cool!  This location is a tad bit noisier I feel since it is closer to the ASU crowd and I gather it's more family oriented because of the marketplace.  Oh well it's just for a quick bite! - Enjoy!",

We were seated quickly, the waiter introduced himself & brought us our beverages but then my boyfriend had gone to the bathroom and come back already (and waited) by the time a waiter came back to check on our menu choices. It turned out our waiter was also serving as the bartender but also not very attentive or even that busy.  Our appetizer  choice was chips salsa & guac. Our mistake from expecting them to be good considering its a marketed burger joint. But really it should be taken off the menu.  a heaping pile of crappy chips, with a tiny size dipping cup of what HAD to be canned diced tomatoes. Really. I am not joking or exaggerating. The tiny side of guac was brownish.  We asked them to take them back. And ordered wings. They were good but took forever coming out.  We ordered burgers, they were good. But then not only had we finished eating, we sat about 10 minutes before I walked up to the waiter who not only was within plain sight from us and a few feet away and asked for our check.  Bad food and slow service...never again",

    "text": "I bused it to Red Robin today for one reason and one reason only: boredom.  When I get bored, my stomach growls.  So here I am, writing this after a mediocre dinner made enjoyable only by our waiter and cheesestick platter.  My dining partner, a rambunctious young man with an annoying tendency towards CHEESESTICK GLUTTONY, sat with me at about 6 PM at one of the outside tables. It took us about 10 minutes to get anyone to serve us even though we were ready with menus set aside. That part was kind of frustrating.  Once our lovely waiter made his existence known, we ordered our drinks, appetizers and entrees. Poppin' Purple Lemonade and Raspberry Lemonade were brought out shortly. Both tasted delicious, despite the fact that my DINING PARTNER kept stealing guzzles (not sips, guzzles) of my drink.  Next, the cheesesticks were brought out. This dish, and this dish alone, was the only cuisine we sampled that managed to have a positive impact on this review. I love the cheesesticks. Seriously, just get the cheesesticks.  The Garden Burger with steak fries was brought out next. Mediocrity to the core. Honestly, the burger tasted like something I would get in a crummy rehab cafeteria. Or school cafeteria. Or vegan jail cafeteria. I'm not a vegan, by the way... I just happen to enjoy veggie burgers. But this one was just drab. I will forever label it the Cafeteria Burger instead.  Our waiter was a nice dude, and once he got our order started, he made sure that we were served promptly. Because of him and the cheesesticks, I will make the bus travel again someday to try more of the menu and maybe change my opinion. Until then, I shall remember Red Robin as an all-American adventure in burgers that I feel \"whatever\" about and dining companions who should have stayed at home.  (No stars taken off for said companion. But he was just so awful today.)  Enjoy, fellow eaters!",

I have been to this location once before when my family came to visit me a while back. I was feeling like their French fries after a long day at work, so I decided head over to Tempe. I was promptly greeted by the hostess staff and I told them I'd like to sit at the bar since it was just me. The bartender said hello and handed me a menu. She was friendly, handed me a glass full of ice water, and gave me time to make a decision. I ordered a Margarita and fish & chips. It's one of my favorite entrees here. The fish is always crispy and tastes fresh. The bartenders didn't really make conversation with any of us sitting at the bar, just helped us when we needed something. The service was quick, food was great, overall a decent visit.",

Only small con is that it tends to feel crowded because the tables are too close to each other so you often have to deal with awkwardly bumping elbows with other diners. Will definitely be back again to try other burgers and drinks.",

It was busy for a Sunday afternoon, but fortunately we didn't have to wait.  We were seated in the bar area and our server greeted us promptly.  We already had the menu's at our table, and after scouring it, I went with the fries.  My friend went with a chicken salad, and I her sister went with the fish and chips.  Overall, our food was tasty, and I really had a good time.  While we were busy gabbing, our server always refilled our drinks, and after I bill came we had our bill split.  She was friendly and nice, and I really enjoyed our time here.  I will say, the handicapped bathroom was out of service when I was there, and it was a bit messy and needed attention overall.  Nothing horrendous, but could have used someone to go in there and clean up the towels on the floor and mop some.  Overall a positive experience and I had a good time. Will be back when I'm in the area again!  Oh, and happy hour all Sunday long!",

Called the restaurant and after five minutes on the phone for them to even find the order, the manager told me she cannot do anything for me. So I will never visit this restaurant or any other location. Very poor customer experience and wasted money.",

    "text": "Went here last night, taking my son and mother out for dinner and heard this place was supposed to be pretty good. I feel lied to about that one. First, dirty dishes brought out with the food. Dirty as in caked food very present on them. Second, lack luster appetizers. No really flavor at all. Third, the burgers... I got the mushroom burger, and it was as if they dumped a lukewarm can of sliced mushrooms on top of a soggy, cold burger.  My mother was less than impressed with her patty melt, feeling it was no better than Sonic. Move on to the bathroom. Disgusting. Littered with feminine products. Will NEVER go to another Red Robin after this experience, even if it were free.",
