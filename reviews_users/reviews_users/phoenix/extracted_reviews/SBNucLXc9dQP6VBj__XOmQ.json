Pretty decent happy hour as well. They have a cozy little patio which is perfect for this time of year. Service is decent -- they're nice, but be prepared as your drinks and food could take a while. Not bad enough to deter us from going back as it's a great establishment and service can always get better :)",

And as someone who waits on bar patrons, I prefer that they do not write down or enter the order while at the table.    But Jamie was very friendly and efficient and the potstickers and crab puffs were unbelievable.  The sauce served with the potstickers was absolutely delicious.   Just the perfect amount of heat.  Definitely recommend.  We have come in for happy hour several Times and it is a really good happy hour menu.   I am updating my review in January 2017 they have eliminated the I pad order takers so the personal service is back. However it was so cold in there on a rainy Friday afternoon.  I asked three different employees to turn the heat on and close the door to the patio but they would not make the smallest effort. Unfortunately as good as the food was the experience was awful. It was not just me and my daughter. Several other tables commented on the cold.  I felt really ignored over the fact that they would not close the door at the very least.  We probably will not go back and this was o e of our favorite places.  I am Once again updating my review of January 2017. I was very frustrated with the response from the staff when the temperature of the restaurant belied any attempt at comfort. I was immediatly contacted by John. With a follow up from Brandon the store manager. They assured me that they had already taken steps to change procedures to put The comfort of their guests first.  The quick response of both John and Brandon have completely changed my feelings of Not wanting to return.  The food has always been amazing and I am confident that my January visit was an outlier and should not count toward my review of Ling and Louie's.   Thanks John and Brandon.",

Ling and Louie's has everything going for it except the feeling of an Asian restaurant as it's a mix of Southwestern influences...Nothing wrong with that..just not plain Asian..  There are a couple of great choices on the menu especially the Evil Jungle Princess and the chicken and rice soup, and some of the appetizers are downright killers sch as the chicken lettuce cups and the chicken skewers. . A word on Houston; the bartender...that guy is bad ass in every sense of  the words...it's just not the same when he is not there...He is cordial, warm, friendly, fuzzy, extremely kind and just a real pro..I can't say enough nice things about him and even the other bartenders there cannot measure up to him...  My first review of Ling and Louie's was a little harsh at first but all my experiences since then have been consistently excellent. The management is top notch and never afraid of any criticism nor to make up for it...  Upgrading my review to four stars because Yay I'm a fan and yes they deserve it...",

Then we waited another 25 minutes for dumplings that were tasty but not particularly warm.  30 minutes later our food came - well, 2 of 3 - another 5 minutes for the third dish.  The restaurant was not full - not even close - so it was not that they were busy.  This is just a very, very slow kitchen.  By the way, the food was OK but not good.   We have been to Ling & Louie's before but it will be a long time before we go again - life is too short! By the way, I can't check good for kids below because you would have to have kids with amazing patience to avoid a melt-down.",

Lettuce wraps were ok, lettuce was wilted as it must have sat under the heat lamp too long. Had to ask for plates napkins and silverware when the appetizer arrived (delivered by different server as our server was no where to be found). After eating our appetizers with menus still in hand waiter finally returns and takes order. Food arrives cold as it probably sat under a heat lamp waiting on a waiter to pick up? Got lucky and got a water and Coke refill when food was delivered. Then waiter disappeared again had to chase him down to get the bill. Food although cold, it was tasty, can't blame the cooks, just poor non-attentive server.",

There was ample room inside and they had a nice outdoor seating area complete with misters.  I was alone so I sat at the bar.  It was Friday at about 6:30pm  but there were a reasonable number of open tables inside and out.  I would say it was about 3/4 full.  I started with the crispy calamari (got for Happy Hour price of $5!).  It was a portion large enough for several individuals.  It had sort of a mayo/ sriracha sauce drizzled on it and it was very good.  I coupled it with a 4 Peaks IPA....mmm I had the Kung Pow beef for my main course.  I guess I was expecting a low quality beef but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and large chunks (it seemed like filet but the server said it wasn't....maybe sirloin?)  It was super tender and the veggies were done just right too.  Service was excellent and it was a fun, festive atmosphere.  I would definitely go back!",

Mistakes happen and it's as much my fault for not realizing I didn't have my card. The problem is... I called the next morning and told the person who answered the phone what happened, he said \"oh yeah, we have it\" - that's it. When I drove all the way back to pick up my card... I walk in and the same bartender who kept my card was there, I said... \"Hi, last night .....\" he said nothing... he just looks at me, hands me the card and says \"thanks\"... FOR WHAT????

    "text": "Very poor quasi-oriental food. The service was approximately on par with the food though the wait staff were very nice--just not very together. My suspicions began when our order of two dishes came out of the kitchen in fewer than five minutes, and was only half right. We had a Honey and Walnut Shrimp that was overly sweet and that was not improved by the mushrooms mixed with the deep fried, over-breaded shrimp, though the walnuts were nice. And, because this was the dish that was freshly made, after we pointed out that we hadn't order the Mango Wango Shrimp, it was hot. We also had an Evil Princess chicken that suffered from the same problem that most dishes made with thin strips of chicken breast and all dishes not freshly made suffer from. I had to struggle to give this restaurant a second star and unless I hear from a trusted source that they ate here recently and that it was excellent, I won't be going back.",

    "text": "It's been two weeks since we had dinner here.  Our waitress Alicea suggested ordering two items from the special birthday menu and the dessert is on the house.  The special menu is for a limited time with entrees not offered on the regular menu. For our appetizer we ordered the pork satay. Three huge, tender juicy pieces of pork got our taste buds off to a yummy start. My husband's entree, the \"Evil Jungle Princess\" made with Filet Mignon and a peanut red curry sauce is on the regular menu. He enjoyed every bite...so did I. The red curry sauce is spicy spicy on the tongue, though a sip of the \"Thai Mai\" frozen drink was a quick fix. And speaking of this drink, it's a must to order.  (Much better flavors than the traditional Mai Tai.) I ordered from the special birthday menu. My entree was called \"Crispy Whole Fish\". As a waiter delivered it to our table the other diners heads turned with curiosity. It was a huge Red Snapper and yes the head, tail and fins still in tack! Every bite of the fish was perfectly moist. We forced ourselves to finish the Snapper since it was so scrumptious! This entree needs to be offered on the regular menu. The vegetable fried rice was fluffy and tasty with a hint of spiciness. (It wasn't oily like other Asian/Thai restaurants here in the valley make their rice.) The second side dish ordered was the wasabi mashed potatoes which was a perfect complement to both of our delicious entrees. And last was the complimentary dessert.....the Chocolate Volcano with vanilla bean ice cream.  We had our waitress box it up since we were full from eating all of the above food. This dessert can be ordered from the regular menu.  At home, later in the evening, we ate the Volcano. A great dessert, it was not to sweet. We're headed back to Ling and Louie's this week and you need to try it too!",

    "text": "Saw this place many times and assumed it was not my type of place.  I am much more into authentic cuisine and not cutesy and forced.  I received a half price coupon however, so decided to give it a try.  I must say, even at half price it was not worth it.    We ordered the mongolian beef and mango chicken.  Was shocked when both dishes arrived layered over the rice.  If you were to remove the mound of rice from the middle of the plate, there might have been 3 tablespoons left of meat.  Not only were portions tiny, the texture of meats were all wrong.  Seemed artificial, at best.  Processed chicken texture.  Overcooked beef.  They claim it's filet mignon, and while it was tender, it was still not quite right.  Both dishes were very disappointing.  Crab wontons tasted good, but were not hot.  How can a deep fried dish arrive lukewarm?  Leads me to believe they are not freshly fried as you order, but maybe reheated.  Even the iced tea was bad.  After adding 5 sweet and lows, there was still no taste.  I have had that happen on occasion before.  Anyone know what that is from?  How can iced tea be tasteless?  I wonder if sweet and low can loose flavor or is there just not enough tea in the water when they brew it?  Maybe to save money on tea bags, who knows!  Service was casual and friendly.  Bar was busy.  Decent place for drinks I suppose.  Many seemed to like it.   I, however, did not.  We will never be back, not even at half price.",

    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  The food is exceptionally good and very fresh and full of strong flavor.  I describe this cuisine as Americanized Asian food.  I like that they offer an option of brown rice with all the meals, and you can substitute most of the meats for tofu if you like that.  The Evil Jungle Princess is my absolute favorite.  A sweet and spicy peanut sauce on top of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and crispy fresh green beens that are cooked just the right amount so they snap when you bite into them.  I also love the Wango Mango chicken with big chunks of mango.  Everyone always loves the New Wave Pad Thai.  The Teriyaki Salmon is cooked to perfection, on top of a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes and green beens.  The Firecracker chicken tastes like wing sauce, so if you like wing sauce you will like this.  Otherwise you might want to pass.  The best part of this restaurant is the kids meals.  They serve them in a Bento Box, with little square compartments for each portion of the meal.  It's a great value that comes with a main dish of either noodles and chicken or wonton chicken, and edamame, and fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce, and a whole large bag of M&Ms, that the waiter was smart enough to secretly hand me on the side instead of serving it up with the rest of the meal.",

The crab rangoon (crab filled wontons here) were filled with real crab and came with a delicious sauce, the best we have ever had.  We also had the potstickers. They were very good, but the sauce was exceptional.  It was a similar to the ginger-soy sauce that usually comes with potstickers, but it was thicker without being sweet.  We didn't catch the other bartender's name, but she was great as well.  We will definitely be back again, this is a great place with a serious kitchen that works hard to earn repeat business.",

    "text": "NOT FOOD ALLERGY SAFE. There's no \"rice\" way to put this...but your restaurant was empty on a Saturday night for a reason. I had a magical dining experience this weekend, one which can rival that of even your wildest dreams! With the number of events that transpired, I think that our server Bobby was working extra hard to make sure our night was special:   We arrived and were seated out on the patio, directly next to the one other group out there. Super awkward, but we are adults so we got past this. Out of green tea, once more, it happens and we are adults so we got past this without complaint as well. Ordered appetizers, one of which was a Caesar salad the server assured me would accommodate my gluten allergy. Appetizers come out and my salad had wonton crackers on it (I've never seen these gluten allergy safe). I point it out to Bobby who said \"I rang in gluten free so they must be the gluten free kind of wontons.\" I've worked in the industry before, so I know mistakes happen. After me pestering the server repeatedly, he went to confirm with the manager. What do we find out? The server was wrong, and had I eaten the salad I would have gotten incredibly sick. He has the salad remade while we order our entrees. The server dropped off my new salad, and was very rude when I called him back. See, this brilliant man set in front of me an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT salad! This one had no cheese, different lettuce and dressing, and veggies...resembled a Market Salad. The server told me I was wrong, this was a Caesar salad and it's fine. He then walked away. In the next 30 seconds I decided I didn't want to risk a hospital visit for crummy Chinese food, so I decided to cancel our order and request the check. Too bad Bobby took 10 minutes to come back... by the time my good pal brought our entrees, I just wanted to leave. But Bobby was super quick in setting down our food and mixed up our orders. Dude had two tables in the restaurant and he couldn't even remember one of his guests had a allergy. I requested he take them back and bring the check. Bobby's manager, who's name I honestly didn't even care to get to know, started arguing with me about what food was delivered to our table. He and Bobby liked to tell us how wrong we were and that all the food they set in front of us was correct. If you were right, why did your server bring me wonton crackers on my salad and tell me they must be gluten free? Why did your server bring me a salad that looked 100% different than the first? Why did you question me twice when I said \"I used to like it here, but your server has ignored my food allergies, brought me multiple things that will make me sick, I no longer feel safe eating here and I just want to leave.\" I had to say that TWICE!!!!",

I had the Thai Mai (AMAZING and seriously a steal for $5 on HH), the Ginger Margarita, crab wontons, crunchy crab roll and Beef fried rice. No joke, all were 10/10. My only criticism would be more meat in the fried rice entree -- there were only about 8 pieces of the beef, but of course it was delicious.  I'm sad this place is so far out on the north east valley, but if you ever find yourself in the area, make sure to stop in.   The selection of food is awesome as well -- I can't wait to go back.",

In the past, I would have given Ling &  Louie's 3.5-4 stars, always pretty good and a satisfying meal. However, they have changed the menu since the last time we have been and I don't know if that means things changed in the kitchen!?!  We started with an appetizer from the \"featured\" Vietnam menu, Summer Rolls $10.95, which I feel were worth $3.95 from a grocery store cold bar :( about 3-4 small pieces of shrimp with some veggies, very bland, and the sauce served next to them added nothing unfortunately. I ordered the Cashew Chicken Stir Fry and my husband the Mongolian Chicken. I again felt like it was something I could have ordered from a fast good Chinese restaurant, not terrible, but not what I would have expected from Ling & Louie's - same went for my husband. Not what we have experienced in the past from here.  Bottom line, food was mediocre at best and not sure with their prices that we will back now (which is disappointing since it used to be one of our go to places for Asian cuisine that pleased everyone). We defiantly don't mind spending $ for good cuisine but now would rather drive a little further and spend it elsewhere. :-/",

I start to explain to my daughter why I think we should just get up and leave, and just then a waitress finally shows up. She is pleasant and she brings us menus and drinks. But I notice that the people next to us, who have a different server, are given a menu containing specials. So I ask our server to see the specials since she did not bring those to us. Strike 3.  The menu is amazing. We order, and the food is delivered super quickly. And it is delicious. So far, all the problems we have faced here are service-related. The kitchen appears to be performing optimally.  I get up to use the bathroom and it is occupied. I get up later and try again and it is occupied. I get up a third time to use it and finally it is free. Why the hell does a restaurant this size have a restroom for only one person at a time. It clearly needs a larger restroom. Strike 4.  I ask for the check and it arrives quickly. I place my credit card on the check and we wait. And we wait. And we wait some more. Strike 5.  The place was not very busy and the service was still awful. But the food was delivered quickly and tasted great. My advice for managers is to do some serious re-engineering on your service quality with a particular focus on servers and hosts/hostesses. And while you're at it, give the folks in the kitchen a pat on the back for a job well done.",

Waited 5 more minutes then got up and walked out. A server stopped us and said are you leaving? I said yeah I waited 15 minutes and did not even get a glass of water? Lots of restaurants on Shea want my dime so I'm out. Another server apologized but there were just 5 tables on the patio.. They were not busy.. I've had drinks there at the Bar and the bartenders were great but I guess sitting away from the bar is a bad idea. Anyway went to Jade Palace and had amazing moo go gai pan. Update: 2/21/18 as you see the customer service manager contacted me, I gave him my number and he said they would be in touch. Still yet to hear from them about my experience.",

For some reason this place is noisy in a very annoying way.  We endured clinking, clacking and other such kitchen/bar distractions during most of our meal.  Try having a conversation!    We ordered meatloaf sliders w/ fries (I know, at an Asian place no less!) and pad thai.  The sliders were okay but at $11.95 not a value.  Pad thai lunch-portion was $7.95 - a bowl of noodles w/ some chicken & shrimp and a few onions & shredded carrots.  I guess next time I want \"Asian\" I'll go all the way to a Real Chinese restaurant.  On the upside, I counted 7 different kinds of sake on the menu.  If you're a sake drinker, maybe this makes up for the so-so food?",

I don't really care how good the service is, or how fun the atmosphere is, if a restaurant doesn't have good food, most other categories don't matter.  The Pomegranate tea I had tasted very watered down, and the Firecracker chicken I had (which was highly recommended by the waitress) tasted a lot like a frozen dinner over mildly overdone rice. The sauce was bland, and the chicken was dry and tasteless.  It might pass for somebody unfamiliar with Asian food.  I was pretty surprised, because the shrimp appetizer we had was VERY tasty.  Too bad. I don't expect I'll be back unless my coworkers outnumber me.",

Crab crunch had a hair in the side of ginger. Lettuce wraps were alright.  We never saw our server, we had to get our own chop sticks and soy sauce.   We waited 25 minutes for the apps. Our drinks were gone by the time the apps came.  WE NEVER SAW OUR SERVER!!  She knew we wanted to order more as we explained.  When she finally came back we asked for the check and she was so rude. We explained how we had a hair on our plate, drinks were empty, we wished to order more, and we haven't seen you in 30 min.  She was the worst server we have ever had. Will not be back. I will also tell everyone I know not to go there.  We even asked the bartender to get our server. Which he did and she yelled at him.  We are shocked at the service.

I now consider this one of my favorite Asian Restaurants.  I've consistently had great service.  They always refill your drinks promptly and are friendly.  We've always gotten our food quickly, so I have no complaints.  My absolute favorites here are: -- For Adults, try the Thai Mai.  It's their version of a frozen mai tai with some rum floating on top.  It's to die for! -- the Mongolian Flatbread Appetizer.  OMG can I just say it's a amazing!  The spicy aioli and filet mignon blend perfectly! -- the Chicken and Rice Soup is so rich in Chicken, I'm shocked at what you get for the price. -- Loaded Chicken Nachos are a MUST try! -- The Buddha's Feast Chicken is delicious with huge pieces of Chicken and a lot of fresh vegetables. -- Firecracker Chicken and Broccoli is always a great standby.  It doesn't have a lot of flavor, but it's very spicy and delicious.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  My husband and I stopped in for lunch after the Farmers Market in the same strip mall.  I liked the warm feel of the place, and that the menu has some options that only have an Asian twist.  My F'n Loaded sliders (3) with filet mignon, bleu cheese, and bacon came with a garlic-ginger soy sauce.  At roughly $12, they were a little pricey, but the filet was very tender and I had a snack for later.  The garlic-parmesan fries were ridiculously addicting, and I found myself continuing to eat them past the point of no return...meaning, I just ate them until they were gone.  Then I was offered more, and had to make the difficult decision to decline.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood!",

It was just enough for the two of us, but probably because we are busy talking to each other instead of eating.  The service was ok...we waited a really long time to get our tab.  Otherwise, I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "This place definitely deserves all 5 stars. We came here on a recent trip to Scottsdale and this was recommended to us. We sat down and were promptly met by our waitress. She explained the menu to us and how the menu is set up. They have a great beer selection for Asian fusion and they were more than willing to let us sample a few that we haven't heard of before. Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get free Edamame. The portions are very big and the service was great. Below you will see what we ate.  Food: Edamame: done just right with a good amount of salt Potstickers: You can tell they are homemade. I wasn't a huge fan but I like the store bought ones. The other 2 people I was with really enjoyed them. Lings Seafood Hot Pot: Fantastic- the curry and coconut milk go together perfectly. It had a lot of mussels in it and it was really good. Just spicy enough but the coconut helped calm it. Budda's Feast with steak- steak was done perfectly and the portion was huge. I got mine with the brown rice and it complimented it well. The veggies were cooked to perfection and the sauce was awesome. I am so sad I left my leftovers at the place we were staying. Surf and Turf- Again, another excellent dish. The portion was great, steak was cooked just right, lots of veggies and the shrimp was not overcooked at all. We got the fried rice with this one and wow- best fried rice I have ever had. It was fresh and you could certainly tell.  I very much recommend going there. I wish there were one closer that I could go to again. The only tip I would give to people going there is: don't order too many apps because the portions are big and you will get full quickly.",

Although several reviews seems to like the happy hour aspect of Ling & Louie's, this review is only for the dining and service presented after coming here twice.  The decor is clean, but decor seams a bit dark.  I suppose this is more for the ambiance of a bar and those enjoying happy hour.  I had the vegetarian fried rice which was nothing more than fried rice topped with fried tofu on the top.  I didn't like the presentation of the dish, but the taste was better than it looked.  My wife and the ahi sliders which were creative and tasty, but her toasted buns were a bit burnt on top.    Our waiter seemed to be friendly and present however after the bill was paid, you couldn't find him to get a refill on our water.  (I suppose this would be what is expected in an Asian restaurant)  ROA (Ratio of Authenticity) #Ethnic patrons/#Total Patrons = 0.1 (This includes my wife and myself.  Not very authentic, but if you are in the mood for Asian Fusion it is worth a try.   If you find this useful, cool, or funny, please check below.",

Although their extensive menu comprises mostly standard Asian-fusion fare, Ling & Louie's changes it up a bit with the addition of some \"American comfort food\" options for its less adventurous patrons.   Aside from the spectacular drink specials and speedy take-away service, L & L's best culinary achievement is its tenderloin - particularly in the \"evil jungle princess\" entree. If you like spicy food and high-quality meat, this dish is definitely a top pick.  Overall I'd say this place is a 4/5, but I give it a 5/5 as far as Asian-fusion restaurants are concerned. The service is consistent and the food never disappoints - Thanks!",

The first time everything was great from the tai mai to the happy hour food which was fresh tasting and warm.  We all enjoyed the experience which led to us going back this past Friday night.  Everything was off.  First of all my friend who has ordered the tai mai several times in the past got a drink she did not recognize.  The rum drink, you swirl to get a slushy/icey mixture, was something with no ice and a bit of rum poured on top of liquid. When my friend pointed this out to the waitress she was told it was the same drink just with a new garnish. We all knew this wasn't True as we had all tried her drink, on our previous visit, as we were fascinated by the icy mixture and also saw it served at several other tables. Maybe the ice had melted because my friend had to wait while the drink sat on the bar waiting for someone \"to slice the new Pineapple garnish\".  When she said she didn't want to wait any longer for her drink to be garnished and to bring her a glass of wine she was told the drink \"was ready and sitting on the bar\" waiting for someone to slice the pineapple garnish\". Maybe it all melted in the 6 to 10 minutes it took to get her drink. I ordered my usual satay which was cold. not particularly fresh tasting, like it had been refrigerated after being cooked.  Tasted like leftovers.",

We walked in and the restaurant was pretty busy on a Monday night. There was a cute bar on the left and a hostess to seat us. It was loud, really loud but such a cool modern Asian American restaurant. The menu was extensive so we needed some time to review.   We finally decided on sharing the Asian seafood hot pot with fried rice and miso soup. Our server was awesome! He was so friendly and because we decided to share, he made sure the kitchen split the dishes for us. The miso soup I wasn't a big fan of but the hot pot made up for it. The flavors of the hot pot was superb with the coconut broth, fried rice, mussels, salmon, shrimp and scallops. Oh my it was so good!!   The portions were generous because I couldn't finish my half of the entree. Kind of like a frequent flyer program, they have a dining loyalty program where you earn a free meal after ten visits. They also offer happy hour M-F from 3-7p, Sat 11a-3p, and 9p-close.   If I'm in the area again, I will come back for sure!",

We placed the order, they told us it would be ready in 20 minutes, and when we walked in the restaurant less than 20 minutes later, our food was just coming out. It was packed nicely and easy to transport. My husband and I tried the miso soup, pot stickers, and the Jeweled Beef. All were delicious! The beef in particular was extremely tender and juicy. Very flavorful as well!   The food was so good, my husband and I decided to come back and try them for happy hour/dinner. During happy hour, they have a menu of drinks/appetizers that are only $5. There are a lot of HH items and we have tried the pot stickers, chicken satay, crab crunch roll, and crispy calamari. For drinks, we've only tried the Frozen Thai Mai but it's so good. I would highly recommend it! They do have some signature Mules, so I might try one in the future.   On a lunch trip, I tried the New Wave Pad Thai. It was different from other Pad Thai I've had, but it was still delicious. It came with both chicken and shrimp. My husband tried the Evil Jungle Princes with shrimp. He said it was delicious.  Overall, I love Ling and Louie's. It's a great place for Happy Hour, lunch or dinner. I will definitely be back!",

This food is absolutely higher quality than your typical Asian cuisine and it only takes one bite to figure it out! High quality meat all around and the noodles are incredible. I would love to make it in here sometime because of the awesome reviews about their vibe, but if I don't I'll happily order their incredible food for delivery!",

It's a newer local place that popped up in my Yelp search, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food -- no greasy noodles here, folks. The people who work there are friendly too (the bartender gave me a good lead on where to find more Japanese whisky selections). This is my new go-to place when I get a hankering for Chinese take out. Looking forward to exploring the menu",

Over the last 3 months or so meats tend to be overcooked and their dishes are full of overcooked rice with little ingredients, such as broccoli, that the dish should contain.  Either the kitchen is trying to save money by cutting recipes short or perhaps they need a new chef.  We will not go there any longer.  This is sad because this place is near our home and we used to go there often, taking many guests there.",

Entrees were Evil Jungle Princess and Firecracker Chicken Tacos, both done perfectly, spicy but not killer spicy, and very flavorful. The bleu cheese crumbles on the tacos - an interesting unexpected fusion of flavors. Even the restroom was decorated nicely and very clean. We will be back!",

Their meatloaf actually is really good.  The Orange Chicken is good but you have to eat it in house.  They do not have a great happy hour anymore, pretty expensive if you are looking for a deal.",

Despite hearing the specials including a noodle dish with tender duck I came to try the Korean Sizzling Salmon as shown in a newspaper ad.  The Atlantic Salmon smothered in hot sesame ginger over a bed of asparagus was really sizzling.  Tyler put it on the opposite side of the table and warned how sizzling it was.  Yes, indeed it was sizzling and the salmon stayed very hot for the duration (even the broccoli).  The sauce masked the underlying farm raised salmon but was tasty.  Not my favorite preparation technique but an acceptable alternative.  While shopping at Sprouts I noticed some sauce on my arm so beware of the sizzle if you give it a try.",

Unsurprisingly, they still have quite a few kinks to work out.  The cuisine is Pan Asian which is not easy to execute given how much variation there is.  Taipei Pepper Beef had a nice kick and the filet mignon cubes were beautifully charred.  The sauce was very tasty but don't know why they have to put it all over rice so that you have no control of how much rice to eat with it.  In fact, this dish needs way more rice given how strongly flavored the sauce is.  The Lemongrass Mahi Mahi was a big letdown after starting on such a high note.  The firm flesh of the fish just does not lend itself well to deepfrying and the lemongrass is such a delicate herb that all flavor is lost in the frying process.  The fried spinach leaves were not crispy and the sauces that accompanied the dish were sweet and boring - contrary to their tagline \"Not for boring people\".    Our waiter let the general manager know about our reaction and he immediately came over to speak to us.  He offered to take the Mahi Mahi off our bill and comped us another Taipei Pepper Beef to take with us.  Service is great and I'm hoping the food will catch up to it.  I'd definitely go back for the Beef dish and will hopefully have  a better experience with other dishes.  So until then...",

    "text": "Per tradition the birthday celebrator gets to pick the dinner location; the choice this year was Ling & Louie's.  Only two of us had dined there before and the recommendation and menu were certainly tantalizing.  After some miscommunications regarding the reservation (well, the two reservations that were somehow BOTH forgotten) we sat down, perused the menu and started calling out what tempted us most.  We ended up opting for a family-style feast so we could sample a bit of everything.  The service was absolutely excellent.  No question.  Our waiter worked with us crafting the best selection of dishes, making modifications to dishes and cobbling together some special requests.  As the appetizers were delivered I was slightly disappointed; somehow I'd gotten the expectation that each dish would be a fusion specialty in and of itself.  Instead, the selections were more a survey of different Asian cuisines (with a few curve-balls thrown in for good measure).  The Beijing Chicken Nachos were the absolute standout here, but none of the other options disappointed.  We struggled to find room on the table for our entrees.  The Orange Peel Chicken was exceptionally light and refreshing; a favorite of all.  The Evil Jungle Princess was another standout.  We passed on the seafood dishes due to food allergies, but I'll surely go back to try those at a later time.  We finished off our celebration with a shared Chocolate Volcano.  It was lighter than expected and perfectly blended the sweetness of the ice cream and fruits with the richness of the chocolate souffle.  All told, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and each of us plans to become a repeat customer.",

If you have a taste for Asian but want something different then this might be your place.  The Pot Stickers and Chicken Nachos are tasty starters and might be enough portion-wise for most. We also had Sweet and Sour Chicken which was very different from traditional S&S but tasted fine and the Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli definately had heat and was good. Food is plated with rice (at least in our case) so family style dining would be ackward at best. This is a local chain with 3-4 locations in AZ and CO.  Bottom line is that I would eat here again.",

    "text": "I've been here twice before over the last few years and raved about the Mongolian Beef. It's been a while, but I had out-of-town guests and around 4pm on a Friday, hoping to beat the dinner crowd, brought them for an early dinner.  First, there is a new amazing front door.  A little heavy, but on the cutting edge of style.  It's almost like one large rustic wood slice of a revolving door.  Also, there is a new patio area with the bar a sort of indoor/outdoor which in Arizona weather is very crowded and fun. It was happy hour on a Friday and the place was beginning to hop. At first seated in a booth by the door we had to move because the glare of the bright sky from the bar was too much.  Reading the menus it was apparent the prices had gone up.  Well, OK, that was to be expected.  Appetizers were 1/2 off, though.  Cool. I had to mention to the waitress that my menu needed to be wiped off as it was sticky with obvious signs of dishes being laid on top of it on both sides. When the appetizer was brought out with the little individual plates, one of the plates had to be sent back because it arrived with a clump of food the dishwasher could not wash off. The food was delicious and since there were only a few tables filled when we first ordered, wait time was very short.  We ordered potstickers and they were great. Then we had mongolian beef and orange peel, which is crispy chicken or shrimp in a citrus-soy sauce.  All the food was outstanding.  We saved room for desert and shared both of the ones they offer.   They were fine, the ice cream being the best part of both.  About halfway through our meal the place started to rapidly fill up and the din was overwhelming.  We could not have a conversation.  I hadn't ever experienced this here before, but had dined on different days at other times.  The waitress and food runners and bus staff did an excellent job.  Fast, polite, efficient, smiling and gone.  When I got the bill I noted to the waitress that the prices advertised on the tabletop desert menu were old prices, noting that each had gone up a dollar, but insisted she let it go. I don't see how anyone could concentrate in that crowd with that noise.  The table next to us was within arm's reach.  There were no specific aisles left to make our way out, so we managed to get stuck in the no exit patio area.  We finally shimmied out behind the bar stools and people waiting to be seated had to shuffle over to make room for us to exit and not to get hit by the huge door which part of would swing inside.  One of the ladies was an extra \"fluffy\" lady, and the other elderly who walked unsteadily with a cane.  It was so immediately peaceful outside, that we remarked about the silence.  In my opinion, at least on Friday nights, this is a happening place to see and be seen and meet up and hook up.  I will try one more time on another day to see if the serene peacefulness of my earlier dining experiences has been retained.  Food=A+  Staff=A+  Decor A+  Friday evening Ambiance for age 40+ people=D  Attention to detail=C",

    "text": "I love this place. It's still a bar and grill, but with an Asian flair. Sushi is pretty much vegetable or crab- it's not a sushi bar. But they've got great dishes. Salmon and sliders are my favorite. That and their spinach strawberry and candied walnut salad- to die for. The atmosphere is nice, nice enough for a casual business dinner, to take a client, out for a date, or family dinner. It's a bar and grill yes, but don't compare it to Applebee's either. It's much nicer, and more quiet. For servers, Danyel and Michelle are my favorites. Always smiling, and remember my drink and favorite dishes every time I'm in, so I always request their table if one is working.  Prices aren't bad either, nothing outrageous.",

They didn't have to ask what we needed they surveyed the table and kept the meal moving.  Which I appreciated since we had the three kids with us.  This is not traditional chinese, so get the asian nachos.  They are a giant appetizer very unique and quite tasty.  EVERYONE enjoyed their meals and the happy hour deals are pretty good.  I see more visits in my future.",

I would figure a place in North Scottsdale would be a bit more adventurous with their menu; but don't let this deter you from coming. The staff is very friendly and it does not feel canned. We had fun joking around with our waiter the most recent time. THe outside patio, despite facing a parking lot, is still nicely designed and can't be beat on a nice night in the valley. The food is very very tasty. I had the jewelled beef most recently and the meat was perfect and flavorful. My girlfriend for the ahi tacos (nothing like going for asian cusine and coming out of it with tacos) which were also awesome. Mongolian beef flat bread appetizer should be a must for everyone. My only gripes really are the lack of innovative plates and also wish they had more than 6 beers on draught. Regardless, at the very least you should just come for the experience of opening the massive front door...it's a blast. Thanks guys",

So we waited a long time for others to leave so they could accommodate us.  It worked out and with out a prompting from us the management made our evening very special.  They went above and beyond for us.  And everyone LOVED what they had ordered. Not one complaint from 10 people. L&L rocks!",

The New Wave Pad Thai was delicious, full of shrimp, chicken, fresh veggies, tender rice noodles and the sauce was unique and very savory.  The Orange peel chicken, was crispy, tangy sweet and citrusy from the orange peel, moist chicken served with fried crunch spinach and brown rice.  The Evil Jungle Princess Chicken was a balance of hot, spicy, creamy coconut and curry a delicious savory dish. We also got the Uncle Foo's fried rice, a delicious umami blast with a unique soy sauce/oyster sauce flavor, and some sort of Malaysian spice, soooo good.  Huge portions, better share everything. Great service by a very knowledgeable wait staff.",

They do have your favorite flavors done in new creative ways. The last time I was there I had the Green Chili Curry Macaroni and Cheese off of their limited March Noodle Month Menu.  It was creamy and cheesy with some red pepper and chicken but definitely packed some heat.  It was not something you would find any where else and I highly recommend you try it before it's gone.  My dinner companion had the Tom Kha Gai soup.  It was delicious with a coconut base, green curry with mushroom, chicken, lime and Thai basil. Our waiter was great, very helpful.  We were seated on the patio and started to get a little chilled, so he lit the patio heater right away.",

The past few times we have visited the service has been exceptionally poor. Last night they were running a seasonal drink special.   It took about ten minutes to get our initial glass of water, which remained empty through out the meal due to the server not attending to us. The server recommended the drinks to us and it took 18 minutes to get the drinks to our table. By this time we already had our food. When the drinks arrived one was biter and we sent it back. The server assured us that it would be taken off the check and apologized.  When they brought out the check (10 minutes after we requested it) it still had the drinks on it. We waited ten more minutes for the server to come back to ask him to take it off. He never did and we paid and left. Needless to say we will not be going back to this location.",

Mongolian beef is usually spicy but this had no spice just a lot of sweetness to it. To top it off I had more rice than the actual entree. I really couldn't even tell I was eating fried rice because the sauce from the mongolian beef drenched it. It was just way too much sauce for me, maybe next time put it separately. Would I come here again? Maybe but not too much expectation the next time.",

We ended up not eating most of it, save except for the shrimp. The firecracker noodles with blue cheese and fried chicken pieces- phenomenal. I would never have thought to put those flavors together, but they worked so well together. I'd definitely go back just for that.",

    "text": "Ling & Louie's acts like upscale Chinese (fusion?) but feels like a chain.  The menu is far more imaginative than the usual Orange Chicken - Mongolian Beef oriental eatery, and that really works on some dishes, such as the Heavenly Buddha.  But other dishes are not so satisfying.  Consider a special the day I was there - duck noodles.  First, there was far too little duck.  Second the duck there was tasted like reheated leftovers with a poor flavor and a dried out consistency.  Third, the sauce was one-dimensional (sweet) and overwhelming.  A complete miss except for the noodles themselves.  The chicken and rice soup, which you can get for $1.50 with a meal, is quite a good deal but very salty.  I expect this in a place where the chef is only a cook, but not where the menu is studded with interesting sounding options.  Ling & Louie's is pretending to be something finer.  If it weren't it would rate four stars as a neighborhood quick oriental diner.  But you should try it - you might feel differently.",

When the server said something about pineapple, it sounded sweet and good.  It sure was yummy. I think I like drinks with pineapple.  For my dinner, I ordered honey walnut crispy shrimp with brown rice (dinner choice is jasmine or brown rice).  She mentioned with extra dollars, they can substitute to fried rice.  They put main dish over rice when they serve (it doesn't come separately), I thought fried rice will change the main dish taste.  Friendly service with nice smiles. I can't explain it but I just felt pleasantly comfortable dining there.   When it came time to pay, the server swiped a card by my table. I just thought it was comforting (although I wasn't doubting anything) that she didn't have to walk away with customers' credit card.  It was weekday dinner but they were busy, so I sat at the outside patio (with heater of course...)  As I walked back inside to leave, I saw the sign Toledo 1,900 miles...(can't remember the exact numbers).  It just made me smile. I didn't know but Louie is from Toledo. I think I will be coming here more frequently.",

Once we arrived their menu has \"GF\" next to the options I could eat. They have GF soy sauce as well. The server was very diligent to make notes in his ticket order to the chef and I felt very comfortable ordering and eating there. And they didn't sacrifice flavor! It was delicious and we will certainly be back! Thank you L&L for providing a place for me to eat delicious Asian food! I don't get these options back home in my smaller Iowa town.

Think of this place as a step up from Pei Wei and you'll be just about right on the money.  We started with the potstickers which were definitely better than what you get at Pei Wei.  My wife had the meat loaf which I tasted - it was excellent.  I had the sizzling chicken and pork which was also quite good.  She had a Mai Thai and I had Kirin Ichiban draft.  Both drinks were great.  Fun atmosphere.  Casual.  We sat next to the kitchen and really enjoyed the smells.  Cons:  The fried rice wasn't anything special, though it was ok.  The brown rice wasn't *good* brown rice - was dry.  Next time I think we'll be happy with the white rice.  If you're sick of the same few places like we are, and you're looking for something a bit nicer than Pei Wei with full wait service, a full bar and better food, this is a great spot.  The prices are a bit more than Pei Wei as well, but not much.  I'm looking forward to going back to try some of the other dishes.",

Finally the bartender ended up seating us and was very friendly, however, once again we waited, and waited, for a server to greet us. I have been in the service industry for well over 10yrs and this kind of treatment of customers is just completely inexcusable.  I was glad I was in good company because otherwise I may have walked out. Once we were greeted by a server, she didn't seem very personable or attentive to out needs or making sure that we were satisfied. She didn't really even seem to care that we were there or not. We ordered appetizers and dinner. I was very pleased with the calamari that came with semi spicy sauce. I ordered the ahi tacos which were also amazing!  I was so stuffed that I didn't get a chance to try any dessert. If It wasn't for the awesome food I would have only given one star.

    "text": "Great hidden gem for vegetarians + the best service in town.   While we veggie folk know that most Asian places will substitute tofu for any dishes in lieu of meat, we also know it is hard to find a place where the tofu isn't a crappy tasting substitute that they don't really want to serve ...   This is not the case at Ling and Louie's. The fried tofu in just about everything and in every sauce is delicious. I kick it way up the spicy meter with 2 or 3 dishes of chili paste and mix that in with my (off the menu) Evil Jungle Tofu. It is so good that I am actually happy that the portions are too large for me to finish. I can nosh on this dish all night ... well after I've left the restaurant.   I'm a pretty simple beer and whiskey drinker, but I my wife loves the great drinks that they make here. They come in blue, red, purple, and green ... I don't know what's in them, but she loves them.  The servers treat you like family and are always extra nice to our little one. They don't put a hot plate in front of a 2 year old like most restaurants and have a vast selection of items for the mini me in your life. The staff is always quick to grab a high chair a few crayons and a fun kids menu.    Every time I've been, it's busy ... but not uncomfortably so. We're always sat quickly and never rushed. The decor is cool and it's casual enough for the entire family and nice enough to impress a date.   Don't miss out on this one. A real 5 out of 5.   - Jason -",

Not sure what's happening but I'm thinking they have either changed management or maybe we just hit on bad days lately?  I used to give them 5 stars but as of lately bordering on 3 and 4 so I'll go with the 4  Friday and Saturday nights are almost always packed with waiting which is a good sign that the food is good. Tonight (Sunday) we went and the restaurant was not busy. Seated immediately and drinks and app ordered.  (Pot stickers should be parboiled before frying because the dough was chewy. ) Our order came nice and quickly but our server did not do a quality check and we couldn't see her to flag her down afterward to order some chili Sauce. My husband and our friend were finished their meals and he went and found a server to ask for some.  Then we ask for water which she brought for 2 of us but didn't ask or bring for all of us??  Server needs to be brushed up on the common sense stuff ...  we were all thinking maybe just a bad night?? But to be honest it seems things have slipped a bit on the hospitality side . Food is still pretty consistent and good. Portions definitely seem smaller then they were but to be honest they are definitely big enough.",

Evil Jungle Princess is amazing. Kung Pow is also great. I've tried their mignon and chicken, love em both. I tried my friends flatbread and that was pretty tasty too!

    "text": "It's not everyday when you can describe a restaurant as 'different' and it's a good thing.  But, Ling & Louie's is different from what you expect when you go out for chinese, and that's what made dining there a wonderful experience.  The food certainly isn't \"authentic\" american chinese, but it certainly is fun.  Here's a rundown of the food my party of four spilt:  Louie's Loaded nachos. Wonton chips with cheddar-jack cheese, chicken, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, hoisin BBQ sauce, wasabi sour cream and \"asian\" guacamole. Delicious.  I highly recommend trying this appetizer.  Honey Walnut Chicken Crispy chicken and mushrooms in a creamy honey sauce with candied walnuts. Awesome!  The chicken was not too heavily breaded, the sauce was sweet, and the candied nuts were an unexpected treat.  Mongolian Beef. Pretty much your standard order.  This one is perfect for someone just looking for typical asian.  Not bad, but not special.  Beijing Duck Noodles Duck with noodles and vegetables. A good try, but not very good.  There was only a small amount of duck hidden in the dish.  The duck also wasn't very flavorful.  I wouldn't recommend this one.  There's so much on the menu that looks different, interesting and good.  If you're looking for asian, but are tired of the same old, same old, then give Ling & Louie's a much deserved time.  And if you're looking to save a few bucks, Ling & louie's is on local dines (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.localdines.com%2Fphoenix%3Fref%3D19485&s=13f273d311728f7448ff75fcf55bdaf2585245ad2d7e3c3cc0823dcdee2befc9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">localdines.com/phoenix?r...</a>) with a $30 for $15 gift certificate.  But a word of warning, it's a popular one that sells out fast.",

Server greeted us after 15 minutes for our drink order. It wasn't a good a start and we considered leaving. We ordered the lettuce wraps for an appetizer with our drinks - given we had ample time to read the menu. Three waters and a coke arrived quickly. The lettuce wraps were out in 5 minutes, but for an unexplained reason, it took almost 10 for my San Pelligrino to arrive. The lettuce wraps were fair at best. The five small pieces of dehydrated romaine contributed to a disappointing first course. The three main dishes arrived 40 minutes after we ordered them. Two Dishes were cold. The third was fresh and hot. We were starving so we did not complain when Marcus finally checked on us half way through the dishes. We put the chop sticks down at 9:20 full and relatively satisfied. We waited 15 minutes for our check. We were getting impatient and scanned the restaurant for our server Marcus. I decided to stand up to make it clear we were ready to go. Marcus emerged and asked if we needed anything. I said, \"the check please, we need to get going. An hour and fifteen minutes is too long for dinner without drinks (cocktails).\" This is when our experience went from fair to bad. Instead of apologizing, Marcus replied in a frustrated tone, \"I checked on you four times.\" My guest quipped back, \"no you didn't.\" Marcus walked away mumbling under is breath. Then we heard him complaining to fellow employees loud enough for us and other guests to hear, \"what do they expect on a Saturday night. An hour and fifteen minutes not fast enough...\" When he repeated his rant, I approached him and said, \"you're gonna take the feedback personally and call me out in the middle of the restaurant? Not professional.\" I could have let it go, but have never experienced this kind rude behavior before. I walked away, paid the bill and left.",

Seriously, it's been probably a couple of years since it was just me and my wife out to dinner. So we visited Ling & Loui's. The food was great, as it always is, but what made this rare evening so enjoyable was Tanner, our server. He's so pleasant, happy, so good at his job and making us feel special. He was truly a part of the \"experience.\" Even a little thing, when we placed our order, we ordered a third dish to take home -- but asked him not to have it prepared until just before we were finished. That's an easy thing for a server to forget, but without us prompting him, he told us as we were wrapping up that he'd go ahead and place that order into the kitchen.  And he was that attentive with ever table we saw him at. Busy night, and he was fabulous.",

Tottie's Asian Fusion location at Scottsdale and Lincoln Road's is pretty good, but the original has slipped.   Ahhhh, just when I was going to give up, I see Ling and Louie's!   What a delight this was from the get-go! Friendly personnel, a wonderful menu with Thai, Chinese and Japanese flair and selections. And quality, delicious food. Really delicious...  The Black Orchid Ahi sashimi was fresh and fabulous.   The entree we decided on was their Surf and Turf, which is filet of beef, sliced with lots of fresh shrimp, mushrooms and onions on a sizzling platter. We ordered a side of fried rice, which wasn't anything to wrote home about, but satisfactory. The Surf and Turf was to-die-for FABULOUS!   Definitely try this yummy restaurant!

First I ordered it with fried rice which was okay, the second time I ordered it with regular brown rice and this was better. I just felt like I could enjoy the perfect flavor of the beef and broccoli more when the rice \"had a little less going on\".   We will definitely go back to Ling & Louie's for the food (and the limeade) but I really can't say much about the service here. The hostess was friendly both times but the wait staff wasn't great to us either time...not rude but nothing to rave about either. Also it was a little awkward for me to have most of the staff in my direct line of sight standing in the kitchen area either A) eating, B) fooling around with coworkers, or C) standing around doing nothing...both times we were there.

I had the seafood hot pot, it was some of the best green curry I've had & they don't skimp on the seafood.  My husband had the evil jungle princess with scallops & said the same thing about the amount of scallops in his dish.  The wine & beer list was good & service is excellent & friendly.  My only complaint is we were seated in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen, my clothes & hair reeked of Asian food when we left - eek!",

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  I will say that both the service and atmosphere at Ling & Louie's was great, with abundant seating and really strong servers who handled our table of six without issue. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  The prices at Ling & Louie's are high, and I was pretty shocked to find that my 'New Wave Pad Thai' came to a whopping $14.25. That would be expensive back in Los Angeles, and it's certainly expensive in Scottsdale. No Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  This New Wave Pad Thai, which I couldn't entirely differentiate from most standard Pad Thai, was fine, but none of the flavors blew me away. You had all the essentials, but it really just tasted like a sum of its parts. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Ling & Louie's is fine, but I wouldn't come expecting to be blown away; and there are better Asian options in the area. No Star.",

The wontons were stiff, and thus hard to get n the spoon. The broth was opaque mishmash of something that was tasty,  it only like warm. She had the shrimp stir fry over rice, which she liked. I had the pad Thai noodles. They were ok but nothing special. Conclusion: the place was ok, but a good Thai or good Chinese place would have been better. I wouldn't avoid it, but don't make a special trip to it.  Update: I forgot, when I mentioned my concerns with the soup, they politely and unrequested removed them from the bill. Very professional!",

He knew everything about menu and establishment . The food is awesome , we had an Ahi roll and Crab wontons to start , bold Asian flavors and crisp look . We had a peanut curry sauces chicken dish \"evil jungle princess \"and a stir fry of scallops and prawns all beyond flavors you would expect , everything on the plates were very present with every bite . This is one place where you will find something for every palate , this reminds me of something that you will crave again and again",

The patio area (we always dine outside, everywhere, unless it is 110+) was previously lovely but too hot, too cold, too sunny, too windy, and now? Just right, says Baby Bear. TVs, heating elements, misters, sun shades, overhead cover, and more integration with the inside and amenable bar area make it perfect for Scottsdale dining near the McDowell Mountain range.   I love great food and so, obviously, do you.  Try the Asian meatloaf and the Big Little Burger in China if you are a carnivore. Awesome main dishes and veg sides no less the mention. Menu also features many dishes for those not so inclined to the meat.",

While I'm dubious of the new law, I wasn't in the mood to debate or ruffle feathers as the goal was to pay for the dinner, not ruin my own evening with displaced anger.   I spoke to the manager, Tanner, at length and we figured out a way for the transaction occur. He went so far as to meet me in the parking lot so I wouldn't be seen by the foursome. It wasn't perfect, but I was very impressed and highly recommend Ling and Louie's Asian Bar and Grill.",

The \"Firecracker\" is a great blend of spice/heat with blue cheese...definitely not your typical Chinese food (of which I generally don't care for), but incredible. If you get there early enough for lunch, there is a good chance you'll get amazing service. Otherwise, as it gets a little more crowded you may have to wait a bit, and take your time. Leave any impatience at the door, because from my experience the servers are friendly but busy, and the food is really quite good.",

I made a reservation just before noon for 7pm. We get to the restaurant and they forgot to hold a table for us. They had me sit with my guests outside in the heat and made no effort to accommodate us. I asked to speak to the manager, Houston, THREE times and each time I was told he would come to our table. He never came. Houston was clearly avoiding the confrontation because he and his team were definitely in the wrong. It would have been courteous to at least come and apologize. We left drenched in sweat. To top it off my glass was grimy and they ran out of cups. Have you ever heard of a restaurant running out of cups? Houston feel free to call me if you want to chat. You guys took my number when I called and made my \"reservation\" at 11:57 am today.",

But when they came out- they just didn't give my son the French fries he ordered and left an open container in his bento box.

Our waiter was personable and willing to comment on choices though I don't need to be told everything is a good choice or a personal favorite.   The calimari was stuck together (which I have never seen before) and luke warm. Was it prepared earlier and microwaved? The potstickers were chewy (which I have never experienced before) and not warm though they tasted good.  The lettuce wraps tasted good but two of the five lettuce leaves we're too small to wrap around anything so it was more open face than wrap The Mongolian flatbread tasted good but the ingredients were not evenly distributed. Some pieces had one or two fragments of topping with a sauce covering the rest of the space.  I had a provencal rose and tried a couple of the cocktails, all of which were tasty...best part of the meal.  Restaurants have good days and bad days. The place was not busy. Some staff were kibitzing at a table. I don't know how to account for the difference except to think the kitchen might be inattentive.",

Started with a cocktali which was highly recommended by the waitress. Shanghai Tea or something like that? It was nothing special. We ordered some Edamame to start, and it never came. I guess someone forgot. Very unfortunately considering how hungry we were.  I had the orange chicken, which was okay. It was too salty,didn't really taste like orange chicken so much as salt chicken... so I wouldn't get it again. My husband got the Evil Jungle Princess Chicken and he didn't seem blown away by it. I tasted it and it was not that flavorful. Dessert was probably the best part. We got the banana spring roll, and it was pretty tasty.  I don't think we will bother going back.",

There is a \"Lou's Brew Crew\" draft beer promotion for July where you can receive a glass or t-shirt for drinking certain drafts, how great!  For food, I ordered the Buddha's Feast with Chicken (substituted with shrimp) and the flavors were full and varied. Shrimp extremely tender and the asparagus, mushrooms, and red onions were perfectly prepared; loved the hint of Thai basil.  My husband ordered the Sizzling Blackened Chicken & Pork.  Again, incredible flavors; blackening added flavor without overwhelming the chicken or pork tenderloin, and the jasmine rice on the side was the perfect complement.    No room for dessert but we had our eye on the Chocolate Volcano, which we will most definitely have on our next visit!",

The order was more than 25 minutes overdue, and when I simply asked how much longer it would be, the bartender said very rudely that it's not her problem.  She never did check on the order, and I got the idea I was being ignored, so after another 25 minutes I simply left. I decided I would give them another chance tonight, so I went in for my pick up order at the time it was supposed to be ready, and it wasn't ready, and I waited another 25 minutes. I asked the bartender how much longer it would be, and she just said I don't know, with no indication she was going to find out. I asked again a few minutes later how much longer it would be, and pointed out I've been waiting for a long time. She said I could talk to the manager if I wanted, with no other solution offered, so I said yes then I'd like to talk to her manager very much. At that point she spent the next 10 minutes waiting on customers and doing one task after another with out informing her manager that I was waiting to speak with him. Unbelievable!!! I finally just walked out again. That's the last time I will walk him to his ridiculously rude restaurant.",

    "text": "This one is a mixed bag.  We were in this part of town, and trying to find something good in the area.  Reviews seemed to favor this place, so we showed-up.  The ambiance was fine.  The server was very enthusiastic and friendly.   Our table orders a few different things.  I sampled most of them (actually, we all did that...sort of \"family style\").  The fried rice was too salty.  I like salt, but it was still too much.  Cut back on the salt while cooking, people...I can add more later if I want.  But I can't take it out once it's in there!    The Mongolian beef was really good.  That was mine, and everyone seemed to agree I got the best dish on the table. The cashew chicken very bland, almost flavorless. Limeade drink was good.   While we dined before \"Marie B\" (whose review I see off to the side as I type this), it's only now I am submitting this review.  I agree with her insofar as the dishes were pretty bland.  Maybe that's why they added too much salt to the fried rice, to boost the flavor?  I won't say this is the \"worst\", but it was definitely underwhelming.  The Mongolian beef, and the great server, saved them from receiving two stars from me.  Just barely.    My advice would be to look elsewhere for your Chinese food fix, unless you happen to want Mongolian beef and some limeade.",

Our waitress was pretty good but not special and she didn't introduce herself, she took our dinner order and we ordered another round of drinks before 7.

That dish was amazing, perfect mix of textures and flavors. Came with a pineapple salsa and a garlic sesame glaze with a side of sweet Asian sauce. For our meals we both got the new wave pad thai. That was alright. nothing to rave about but not bad either. They had good serving sizes for that as well. For restaurant week it comes with a dessert, and they gave us a mocha expresso mousse. That my friends, was horrible. From the flavor, to the texture, I would've been happier without it or something else because that left a bad taste in my mouth literally and figuratively.  Overall everything was okay, but I would definitely come back for the shrimp lettuce wraps.",

Later when he found out that it was our first time there, he gave us his business card and a card for a free appetizer. Our server Christie (I like the personalized name card left on the table) was also very kind, helpful and attentive. Yes, the food was tasty but the great experience we had here is what took it to the next level. The decor is modern and had sort of a \"club-like\" feel to it.   Because we were there on a Sunday we got to take advantage of all day Happy Hour which is available throughout the restaurant, not just in the bar. HH runs M-F 3-7pm and all day Sat and Sun. What a deal! Food offerings land at $3, $6 and $9 and drinks range from $3-$7. From this menu we selected the Crab Wontons. They were filled with creamy, cheesy crab and served atop a sweet citrus-chili sauce. Delicious. I also suggest you don't miss the Korean Steak Lettuce Wraps, packed with flavor and tender meat.  They offer your standard soups and salads, noodles and rice, along with a few random American comfort food items. But what makes them exciting are their Wok Fired Classics and Create Your Own Sizzle. Think a hot steaming plate like fajitas. You pick your surf and turf and sauce. My bf chose steak and shrimp and was a fan. I went with the Jeweled Beef, similar to a stir fry with tender sliced flat iron steak, yakisoba noodles, snap peas, spinach, mushrooms, Thai basil, and spicy chili-soy. It was a huge portion with a ton of flavor.    Our side of Miso Soup was an impressive size and warmed our bellies. Uncle Fu's Fried Rice was the only item that didn't quite hit the mark as it wasn't mixed all the way and didn't have those nice crispy bits. I see this as a good place to bring a group. Since portions are huge you could easily order a few things for the table to split.",

It's another fusion Asian place where they try to do too many different foods and don't do well at any of them. We had the sizzling shishito peppers, edamame, seafood curry rice, honey walnut shrimp, kungpao chicken and kungpao tofu. The sauces were just overwhelmingly sweet without much else going on. The shishito peppers were not True shishito peppers - I think they just jalapenos because they were all way too hot. Shishitos are not spicy - they are more like bell peppers but on the bitter side. The shrimp was very thickly breaded; the rice was too hard; and the chicken was tough and lukewarm. It definitely sat out before being brought out and the other dishes weren't steaming hot either.   Our server was definitely having a bad day as well. She really didn't seem to want to be there and forgot half of our order including drinks, our request for plates and silverware. I wasn't expecting much based on the menu but I at least expected my food to be hot temperature wise.",

We requested a booth (which we never do in-person without prompting), which was graciously accommodated.  We ordered the beef lettuce wraps, the bibimbaps, and the chocolate volcano to finish up the meal. The waitress was awesome: super on top of things and funny to boot. The beef lettuce wraps were AMAZING. The s/o never has good things to say about lettuce wraps, and actually liked these ones quite a bit!e The freshness of the lettuce and the sweet spicy tender beef all came together in just.. the best way.   Unfortunately, the bibimbaps were not so impressive. The waitress said that this was the most popular thing on the menu that people raved about, which honestly, given the number of good korean places around the Valley, surprises me. Bibimpbap is one of my favorite dishes in any cuisine, and I've never had a bibimbap that I didn't love, except for this one. The \"bibimbap\" was just fried rice with a chicken and veggie stir-fry on a skillet (that wasn't even hot enough to cook the egg a little (thankfully, I like my egg runny)). No gochujang, no separation of the different veggies to have different flavors.... all in all, really disappointing. The flavors were fine, but it unfortunately didn't feel like an homage to Korean food, more like an insult.",

I moved onto my soup and talk about mushroom overload! Once I got to a bit of chicken something tasted off. The entire time I was eating it the chicken tasted funny but thought it might be because it was in the soup broth. My boyfriend had the lettuce wraps and the fried rice. He also only had one lettuce wrap as it was so small and super salty. His fried rice was also super salty and he couldn't even finish it. Skip to a few hours later and my stomach was making all kinds of sounds....well, guess what...I got sick! My stomach has been messed up for 12 hours now and I know it was from the chicken in the soup. This was extremely disappointing and we will not be ordering again.",

    "text": "Went here yesterday for lunch, arrived at 1145ish and sat at the bar. There were two others sitting when I arrived. I sat there for 15 mins while the bar tender did not even greet me. I had to get my own menu from the wall right as you walk in, and the only way I knew where they were is because I saw 4 parties get sat and that's where the servers were pulling the menus. I was finally acknowledged after I had my menus. I then asked for an Iced tea, and it looked like I was bothering him for asking. Again it was about another 5 mins before I received my tea. He was too busy dealing with take out orders, and seating other people as they walked in. It was about another 5 mins to place my order and when I did he looked at me and said I drank my tea to quickly. Who says that? To top it all off there was a lady that walked in a few moments after I received my food and sat at the other end of the bar, and the way he spoke to her was astonishing. He could barley hear her as she was soft spoken while trying to order, and at one point he threw his hand up and said never mind lady. I could not believe it. He gave me his name but I'll keep it to myself as I am not that guy. Poor service and I was ready to walk out before I even received my tea. Will never come here with that type of service. The food was perfect tho so if you feel like being ignored and want to wait 20 mins before your order is taken, then this is the place to come and sit at the bar. Unreal!",

I think the chef should've taken notice and replace those in the dish so I get the full order. However it was DELICIOUS! Service was fast and perfect in every way including fly-by checks. I'll definitely be back!",

Even my Chinese in-laws love it.  You can't go wrong with the Evil Jungle Princess with any kind of protein, the filet mignon sliders, Asian meatloaf, the fried calamari, crab crunch rolls, etc, etc.  They have a happy hour with some of their apps half price.  Beware, parking is a PITA almost all the time!  It can be a bit expensive, two adults and two 3 year olds usually runs around $45 with no drinks and before tip, but it is a wonderful splurge for us.",

I've had much better california rolls and wouldn't really recommend it. The lettuce wraps were really good, though, and i had enough to take home leftovers. I had the pinot grigio wine and it was quite nice and sweet.   My friends also had sushi (vegetable roll and crab crunch roll) and potstickers. They both enjoyed their items.  the best part of it all were the prices. all 3 of us ate and drank for under $40 total. MY NY self was in shock at how cheap the bill was.   I would definitely come back and try other things",

Filet Mignon on the first trip and I haven't been able to order anything else yet.  They give you a good size serving and the filet slices are tender and delicate in contrast to crispy veggies and peanuts, the sauce is pretty spicy too which I love.  Husband enjoyed the Pad Thai on the first trip but has been hooked on the evil jungle princess with chicken since our second trip.  Service has always been great during our dine in trips and the frozen mai tai is so good it's dangerous.  I do plan on trying other menu items at some point soon (writing this as I wait for my husband to come home with our kung pow and evil jungle princess take out)......",

A young man came to greet us and we asked to be seated in a booth if possible.  The young man looks around and says \"I can seat you here in a half booth\" and point to a half booth near the entrance.  I ask again if we can sit in one of the booths on the far side of the room near a window.  He replies \"Those booths are for parties of six\".  We are astounded at his reply since the place is empty!  So then he says \"where would you like to sit\" without so much as a smile.  I replied \"in another restaurant\" and turn to my husband and said \"let's go\".  We ended up next door at Salt and Lime, had a wonderful meal with very friendly and professional wait staff.  After reading some of the other negative reviews I am glad we walked out.  We will never go back because of the way we were treated.",

Despite my friend nearly stomping on his foot with her stilettos while he was chatting up some other clients he is an amiable, witty character and actually remembered us from a previous visit) and ordered the ahi lettuce wraps for an appetizer. My mouth was sooooooooooo happy! What a delicious and wonderful change from the regular chicken lettuce wraps (although they offer those too, but I haven't tried them).   I ordered the strawberry limeade and the Evil Jungle Princess with jasmine rice and the flavors are such that you wish the meal could go on forever...even as your tummy is telling you that it's time to stop the madness.

I'm not a huge fan of Asian food, so I might have been inclined to go with 3 stars, but my boyfriend really liked it, so I went with 4.   The restaurant has a good variety of popular dishes from different Asian cuisines. We ordered:  Pork Pot Stickers... slightly crispy on the outside with a good dipping sauce. Overall, not bad.   Tom Kha Gai soup... coconut based spicy-sweet soup with chicken and mushrooms. The flavor was a little too intense for me. But the bf was a fan.   New Wave Pad Thai... ordered with out chicken. The shrimp was blackened and good. I liked the sauce a lot. I had one serving with some lime squeezed over it and another with chili paste mixed in. Both were good!  Evil Jungle Princess Beef over Jasmine Rice... I didn't really like my first bite, but as I kept going, I started to like it more and more. What a great mix of flavors!!   Limeade... I really liked their limeade. Good compliment to the asian food.   Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Overall, it was a good experience.",

We started off by trying a couple of their appetizers; the crab wontons and the coconut shrimp. Both were pretty tasty and were served with a sweet and tangy tropical sauce that I quite enjoyed. I do wish that the crab wontons would have been a bit crunchier though. For our main dish we split the \"F'n Sliders\" which were these mini burgers loaded with strips of steak. They weren't too bad, but were pretty messy and hard to eat without feeling like a slob. The best thing we had was probably the Tom Kai Gai soup... slightly spicy but very flavorful. This is the type of place that'd probably work a little better with more of a Pei-Wei's type of set up,,, it has more of a casual, almost bar-like atmosphere... it doesn't feel like you're at an Asian restaurant when you're here.   In the end... it's a cool concept (Asian dishes with more traditional American fusions) it just didn't wow me like it could have. Still it's a solid spot with a fun menu that you should try. 3.5/5.",

The orange chicken and crispy spinach is divine, the walnut shrimp so tasty, and I love the fact that they use filet for the beef in all their dishes!  It is always cooked so perfectly and the meat is so tender it just melts in your mouth!  They do a great job on appetizers too, potstickers, sushi and the soups are all excellent, especially the chicken and rice, it has just a hint of spice.

Also, their menu is written slightly cutesy - which I usually find annoying, and even MORE so in a Chinese restaurant.   \"Chop-Chop Lunch Specials\"?

I did like the spicy chicken and rice soup, however they brought me out the wrong soup the first time. I was also brought out the wrong drink too!   My date ordered a salad which was not bad, but not very good. There was too much dressing and it made everything else in the salad very soggy. I had the sweet & sour chicken, but was not impressed at all.   The food is not the worst, but I can get better Chinese food down the street from this restaurant. I do think the service was so bad that it did bring down the rating, I did get a laugh however because they seemed to mess up on everything we ordered like we were on a hidden camera show.",

Granted, it was take-out, but I was lusting for some Pad Thai. They do a nice one - excellent/vibrant flavors and generous chunks of moist chicken and shrimp.   Tried Chicken Lo Mein as well. Noodles were of good quality and nice and firm. Flavors worked well and ample chicken pieces.  I wish Take-Out orders would be handled by Hostess or other, in lieu of Bartender at very busy bar. I felt like sort of a tool and \"in the way\" standing by ppl seated at bar w/not a seat free.  Not a huge deal though. :)  *NOTE: Parking is viciously competetive around 5-7pm on weekday evening, if you're cheap like me and don't valet. LOL",

There is a lot of great food out there, but being great and standing out on your own is harder to find.  The food did have a kick to it, but a good kick.  Being pretty mild as spice goes, I enjoyed it.  It was a little higher then my initial comfort level for some dishes, but I enjoy the increase.  I also really enjoyed the whiskey based cocktails.  Never done but with whiskey till I cam here, now I find myself ordering wherever I go.   So thank you for the amazing food, expending my horizons a bit and the great service and atmosphere.",

Infact we had to get up on two occasions to even find our server.  The soup arrived- COLD... and OMG I've never tasted so much salt. I had the curry soup that was so salty I couldn't eat it. My 11 yr old son had miso soup that was so salty he spat it out- my husband had chicken soup that was so salty he had to drink two glasses of water with it.  When I asked the waitress about the salt in all the soup her reply \"well they shouldn't taste too salty, the only one that does normally taste salty is the miso soup because of the MSG.\"    Then arrives the rest- the pad thai was ok, and just OK.  Their signature dish The Evil Jungle Princess was made with burnt barbecued chicken pieces that did not taste good and added a very odd flavour to a curry dish. They should have used the same chicken found in pad thai. By the end of this awful experience I left the restaurant like an evil jungle princess.   7/3/2017 Im a little late to post an update. After being contacted by the manager we went back- service was better. The soup we test tasted before ordering - they were still horrendously salty-  BUT the chicken lettuce wraps were beyond fabulous- infact they were so we good we ended ordering 3 orders of them--- Id go as far to say probably the best lettuce wraps in the city- they are not served with the usual fall apart/slivers of iceberg lettuce leaves, instead they use romaine  a most definite improvement over other restaurants leaf choice",

For dinner we had pad Thai, surf and turf, salmon and chicken cashew stir fry.  I asked for the chicken stir fry to be a little spicy...it was a lot spicy, so be careful with that request!

It's never a good thing when restaurant booths are set up in a claustrophobia-inducing style, with the tables and seats so crammed together that the tabletop is way too close to your body.   I followed the Yelp app announcement and signed up for their email list in order to get the free lettuce wrap appetizer, which was decent. For my entree I ordered the Evil Jungle Princess with shrimp and fried rice. It sounded really tasty on the menu, but the dish ended up being very bland, and it all seemed kind of... mushy or overcooked. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever eaten, but I would not order it again.  Our server seemed friendly but wasn't the most attentive. My mom was waiting to get her water glass refilled for quite a while, and ended up just flagging down a different server. Overall not impressed with this place.",

The Chicken Lettuce Wraps blow the pants off of  PF Chang's.  And during Happy Hour they are 5 bucks along with the Crispy Calamari which was the BEST tasting Calamari I've had anywhere! We also tried the tacos, Both the Firecracker Chicken and the Ahi Poke explode flavors all through your mouth leaving you wanting more and more. The tacos came with an Awesome tasting Fried Rice for a $1 more I believe, steamed rice white or brown are the other choices to go with your Tacos.  We washed it all down with the with a warm flavored Inkberry Shiraz Cabernet & a Great tasting Kona Brewing Co. \"Big Wave\" Golden Ale. Prices are Right on Time during Happy and I am a fan for life of this restaurant.  If you can get a seat in Amanda's area you will be treated King and Queen. She knows a lot about everything on the Menu and almost all the drinks. She and the rest of the staff seem to enjoy their jobs and walk around with lots of Smiles! Management came to check with us after our meal and I pretty much told him I be back and others will too!",

Since this was a special occasion, we were deeply disappointed that the chocolate cake dessert was unavailable due to an oven not working.

I'm not usually into spicy food, and these are just right- a little spicy, but not so spicy I can't stand it.  I think the Bleu Cheese gives it a unique flavor for a taco, and all around these things are just too good.  I also love their crab puffs... real crab and tons of cheese!  So, so yum!    I just wish they'd bring back the duck flat bread... that thing was really delicious too.  If you eat in, be prepared because I have never, ever seen this restaurant quiet or empty, except for right after they open.  Otherwise, it is hopping and there's usually quite a few people waiting for tables... but it is totally worth it.   Their outside seating is really nice, and they do have heaters for those brief times it gets slightly chilly here :D",

The food was super when it opened, then it went downhill a bit, however, we went back and it is almost as good as it was when it first opened.  The atmosphere is good- not too noisy, and the outdoor area is beautiful.  We recommend this place.",

I looked around at the other tables and it did not appear that servers were checking on their tables. Unless it's a Scottsdale thing where people like to be left alone.   Three stars is for the food. I want to be fair and the food is pretty good, not great, but worth a try. We ordered beef lo mein, which had the most tender pieces of beef perfectly medium rare; however, the entire dish had the burnt wok taste. Kind of like what it tastes like when the grill needs to be cleaned. The honey walnut shrimp was served on a bed of rice. Clearly the food here is served for individuals rather than family style. We shared everything family style anyway. Lastly we ordered the meatloaf. Not sure how this fits into Asian fusion and it was just okay.",

Kevin had the Shanghai Shrimp and Scallops. He enjoys a lot of spice so they offered to add some sambal paste to his dish. Both dishes were generously sized and full of amazing flavor. Ashlee provided stellar service - we really enjoyed chatting with her! We will definitely visit Ling & Louie's again during our next visit to Scottsdale.",

I've been to a million Asian restaurants in my life and never have I had food like this before. 1st of all, mind you, I threw up 29 times last night, no joke. I had the worst food poisoning I think that I have ever ever had, from their food. I ordered their Hawaiian sweet and sour chicken. You would think that sweet and sour chicken is just going to be sweet and sour chicken right? No. This was super super spicy and to be honest it tasted like shit. I've NEVER had sweet and sour chicken that was spicy. It tasted terrible. They don't make it like that anywhere I've ever had it before. I guess that's their style, but I don't like it. it's gross. And like I said it was WAYYY too spicy. I didn't even finish it because I couldn't take it. And then I ended up like I said getting sick as a fucking dog all night long. I have chronic pancreatitis, so I really didn't need for this to happen to me. Since when do Chinese restaurants make their food spicy?? That is Lame. I won't be back. EVER.",

    "text": "When looking for a new place to try I always try to scope out the menu before going.  The menu at Ling & Louie's has some awesome looking items on it.  When we first entered the restaurant there were no employees around to greet us.  It was initially confusing on whether we had to seat ourselves or wait for a host/hostess.  Finally someone walked up and greeted us and took us to our seats.  The server was pleasant and explained the restaurant well.  We ended up ordering the hand-wrapped potstickers, lettuce wraps, new wave pad thai, and miso soup.  I also had a ginger-lime margarita and 22oz Ling's lager.  The food was EXTREMELY disappointing.  The potstickers were by far the best of the items we ordered.  The lettuce wraps (not the lettuce) and the pad thai tasted so strongly of GAS from the wok that it was very difficult to swallow.  The pad thai was lacking flavor and spice and was just so overpowered by gas from the wok that any other flavors it may have had were unnoticeable.  This goes for the lettuce wraps as well; the lettuce they use is fine, however the chicken mix they wok'd was so gassy tasting that my wife struggled to finish it as well.  The miso soup was equally terrible as it was full of thin stringed seaweed.  Miso soup should not have more seaweed than liquid.  It was awful.  To top it off, I ordered my 22oz lager in hopes of having something to wash down the gas after-taste we were suffering through.  I received my beer 16 MINUTES after ordering it, and the bar was NOT busy, as this was a Wednesday night.  That to me is just unacceptable.  Drinks should be the quickest and easiest thing to get customers.  This restaurant receives 2 stars for good potstickers, and a good margarita, subpar overall service, and lackluster food.  If you like your wok'd food tasting primarily like GAS then this is the place for you!  Just not for us..",

After ordering it and lunch, was told they will cook it fresh so the app will take like 10 minutes. No problem.   Well, 10 minutes turned into 30. Server apologized but said they are coming out of the oven in 45 seconds. Ok we've waited this long. 5 minutes later still no food. Now we're at almost 40 minutes and I was hangry!!!

Christine (of Ling & Louie) has been wonderful, sending me a couple of coupons, along with a list of her appetizer suggestions and a description of why each is so good.  She has followed up to ensure that I received them, and again to ask if I have visited the restaurant again.  I did.  I was back on Monday night.  I tried her suggestions.  And yes, the Black Orchid Ahi Tuna was terrific.  Really good!  The Ahi Lettuce Wraps I was much less impressed with, and the Emerald Spinach Salad was quite flavorful.  And the bartender (we were seated at the bar) could not have been more courteous.  And then.....  Whether it was the spinach, the raw tuna, or the chicken...we became sick.  Almost immediately, or within 20 minutes of the meal.  Thank goodness I have a 2 bathroom condominium!  So, Christine, I am certain you will understand when I say, I'm sorry, but I have two additional coupons that I will not use.  I went with the best intentions, hoping for the best but...I just can't.  I just can't change my review to anything more positive right now.  Thanks for your understanding.",

    "text": "I've been to Ling & Louie's a couple times now and I really feel it is a solid place.  The one thing that does make it stand out over places with a similar feel is their service.  It's great.  They really are attentive and friendly, which to me, is just as important as the food.  The food here really is A-OK.  I haven't had anything that's blown me away, but I have had some good food that isn't too expensive and leave me satisfied.  Last time we went I had the chicken and rice soup, which was light, but flavorful.  We also had the nachos, which were very unique and decently tasty.  I can't remember what I had the first time, but it must have been good because we came back.  Given that this restaurant is in a good location for us, I am sure we will be back.  I would say it's worth visiting and a nice change of pace from your typical chain restaurant.",

It was really delicious.  I love the Black Orchid Ahi Tuna. I went for lunch with my husband and we had a great time.  The bartender, Paul is great.  My husband's house margarita was really good.  The prices are so reasonable.  I can't wait for my next moms night out.",

I love that they serve their Orange Chicken with crispy spinach. Not quite as good as the Bamboo Club but that is hard to beat in my mind. The food was very tasty and if you sign up for their text club when you sit down you will get a free order of edamame. Also, they have lunch specials for around $7 so that might be a great time to stop in.",

FYI:  they will only bring you water and chips if you request it otherwise they will not bring them.  I was disappointed in the menu it was not too big and most of there items were on the spicy side which our family does not eat.  Plus we have an allergy to soy and all there items have not only Soy but Genetically modified soy is the worse stuff ever... the wait staff did try to find me something to eat without soy and they did not realize Soy is the # 1 ingredient in mayo....so could not eat anything except the chips which were really good...They do have a gluten free menu but they should have a Soy free gluten free menu as well - so I will not be returning.",

    "text": "Ling & Louie, hmmm, I'm having a bit of hard time to define this place. The menu serves a wide range of Asian foods, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese (from my first glance of the dishes and its names), then there is a full bar, Happy Hour menu such as Asian fusion 'flatbread' and 'tacos', it just made me more confused, a place serves many kinds of Asian food but nothing is specialized? Just because you put a description of 'asian sauce', makes a taco Chinese? Then there is this interesting looking clock on the wall next to the kitchen, a clock consists '12' on the top as normal, but the rest numbers are replace by a '5', that just made you start singing, 'it is five o'clock somewhere', and 'let's drink'! So yeah, this is a bar with many kinds of Asian fusion foods. Do not come if you are craving for a more authentic asian cuisine, that was my mistake, yeah...",

Service was a little slow to greet but other than that he was spot on and made some great recommendations. The Asian Nachos (1/2 price during happy hour) were amazing! Crunchy, cheesy, spicy...just the way nachos should be including this tasty hoisin BBQ sauce and Asian guac. The flatbread and sushi on happy hour are also a steal at 1/2 price. The only complaint is about the Moscow Mule we ordered which was not a purist version of the drink which is okay but there was no description on the menu to lead us to believe it was an Asian fusion Mule. Overall, good food and service, great happy hour specials plus a cozy patio to boot! We will definitely be back for a weekend happy hour sometime in the near future.",

I highly recommend embracing the fried rice with any meal and try to the Honey entree... One great fact, is that they can make any dish with tofu so it's very accommodating to any dietary needs. Looking forward to going back again soon!",

They were very accommodating and attentive. We got to sit next to the kitchen where you can actually see your food being prepared, so you know it's fresh.  The food was great. You can't go in expecting traditional Asian food or PF Changs. The food at Ling & Louie's is more of an Asian meets American Comfort Food. We started out with a shrimp & avocado tempura roll. I thought it was okay, however my friends thought it was fabulous. I was more of a fan of the Emerald Spinach Salad...fresh, light and freakin' tasty! You can't go wrong with strawberries, walnuts and blue cheese.  For entrees, we tried out the crab cakes and the Evil Jungle Princess, which is a signature dish that even has her own twitter handle (@EvlJnglePrinces if you're curious). I enjoyed the crab cakes, but loved the Evil Jungle Princess. It's chicken and fresh veggies in a peanut-red curry sauce.   And if you're in the mood for some drinky drinks, get a Guava Tea. It's Guava Rum meets Arnold Palmer. Light, smooth and refreshing...dangerously deceiving.  Definitely go check them out...you won't be disappointed.",
