    "text": "First time customer. I know this franchise has been around for a while but I just haven't made the time until today since I just moved into the area and am now very close to this location. I was really looking forward to some good eating. I let the tortilla warming lady know I was new. She said they are similar to chipotle. I requested some chronic fries for my kids. These are fried upon request apparently. I then asked for two tacos. She warmed them and put my meat on them. Then they sat in the air conditioned air on the cold metal plate until the cashier was done with her previous customer. Cold toppings were placed on my already cooled meat. We finally rang up my order but my fries were still cooking I guess. I asked how long it would be because I felt like there was a disconnect with my order. By the time I got the fries my tacos were totally room temp. The fries were not crispy. They were not fried at a high enough temperature. Soggy flimsy fries before toppings were placed on them is not enjoyable imo. It was a let down for me. As for flavors, everything was just ok. You can't please everyone. I get it. I don't plan to come back though sadly.",

The main guy behind the counter wanted to make sure everyone knew he was an \"artist\" and that he knew the best way to top anything to make it look good.  It seemed to disappoint him that I had my own preferences for my toppings and did not turn him loose to make his vision.  At each step, he would stop and tell me about something he made before, or yell something back to the kitchen. When it was made, he moved on to another diner, explaining again how they are artists, while I waited for someone to ring up my food so I could pay and leave.  They did put a lot of toppings on, but it seemed to lack value for the price (out of cabbage, out of pico, big pile of wilted small diced lettuce). I would rather pay a little less and have a normal quantity of toppings and a more efficient / organized experience. I don't want to spend 15 minutes waiting for my food at a fast casual place.",

I had the carne asada tacos a couple times and today I had the beer battered fish. It is really good. Ordered 2... could only eat one. Pretty good size tacos. I saw a couple of my coworkers come in when I was sitting in there. When I got to work they were eating these HUGE tasty looking burritos.   Yes they have other meats but I probably won't stray to far from the carne asada and fish. Might have to give in to the chicken though.   Thanks staff. You guys are great.",

As my bread was toasting, I realized they also serve Al Pastor, I had to order a taco!  It was all very flavorful! The service was great as the girls working the counter were happy and helpful for someone who had not been here before. I like that they offer refried beans as an option and the lime juice is great as well.   The only thing I would like to see change is that they keep the prep area a bit cleaner and if the toppings mix that they try to clean that a bit. There were onions mixed in the cheese and guacamole dripped in the salsa. I noticed because I don't like either of them but wanted what they were in.   I will definitely bring my family in to try it!",

The tortilla was, I'm sure papyrus, or maybe the dried-skin of a truck-stop lot-lizard but it wasn't that appetizing either. I was hoping for another Brushfire like experience but the idea of driving by Rolando's to eat here again, not happening.   Oh and it was barely warm enough to melt the cheese , the side order of the potato taco was cold , having sat the entire time the order was being made. You have to admire their commitment to running a business as if stoners called the shots though:)  Two reviews in a week?  Blame the water heater failing for this renewal of eating out:)",

Recently I moved to the Metro area, and I was so excited when I saw there was another Chronic Tacos nearby. I went there last week to dine in, and I have to say that I was very disappointed in a few things.  First off, the service was not the greatest. I myself used to work in the restaurant industry, and usually show a little mercy to food service employees who aren't having the best day. It is a tough industry to work in, and they aren't appreciated enough. Keeping that in mind, I was surprised at the lack of efficiency. The 2 employees working the line seemed to be very confused and moving very slow, and my fiancee had to repeat his order 3 times to the blonde female. I asked for a \"teeny tiny bit of cilantro\", and the guy drowned my poor tacos in it. Neither of them smiled or seemed to want to be there.  Not the biggest deal in the world. The quality of the food, however, left more to be desired. I have always ordered the same thing...carne asada tacos. At the 3rd St location, the carne is unbelievably delicious and lean. At the Peoria location, it was cold and half of it inedible due to it being so insanely fatty. They obviously are not ordering from the same vendor or preparing it differently, but it was not good.  I think I will just travel the extra miles to the 3rd Street location where I know the service is great amd friendly, and the food is always delicious.",

Both were too greasy but were seasoned ok. But they were a big disappointment because both the corn tortillas and meat filling were cold. I hope I don't get food poisoning from the under temp meat. It might have been hot when they scooped it onto my plate, but had gone cold by the time I paid and sat down. This is even though there was only one person ahead of me in line.   They had 2 assembly line workers during lunch rush - just not effective to move the line fast enough. It only got worse after I made it through the line. And staff were initially friendly but showed their stress as they got more and more overwhelmed. Tables weren't being wiped down either, so you had to clean a place to sit down.

    "text": "OK...so I've read the reviews, complaints, and compliments given to Chronic Taco, and - based on my experience today - would have to say that hands down, Chronic Taco has its competitors beat.  Not only was the staff friendly, they were quite helpful when - as a new patron of their establishment - it came to me placing my order, answering all of my questions, and recommending particular favorites they have tried.  The portions were quite generous, and, despite previous reports to the contrary, were heated accordingly.  While similar in nature to its competitor's menu, Chronic Taco's flavor choices were right on the mark - savory, and full of favorable spices and herbs. There was enough heat in the food combination to provide excellent flavors, yet it strayed from being offensive to the pallet.   If you're looking for something quick that will satisfy your appetite, I highly recommend trying this restaurant. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "I decided to do 3 stars because I do like their food. But had a really disappointing experience today and it put a really bad taste in my mouth and probably won't got back because of it. My boyfriend and I have been there several times before, my boyfriend always requests rice and beans on his tacos; he's never had an issue. Today I decided I wanted to try the tacos with the rice and beans; the girl looked at me like I offended her and told me they weren't allowed to put rice and beans on the tacos. I was surprised since my boyfriend has done it so many times before, but I told her if she's not allowed to do it then don't. She said she'd do it this time but the management is cracking down and they won't be able to do it again. While we where checking out, she told the general manager that we asked for rice and beans on our tacos. He then proceeded to say \"oh yeah, I recognize you guys and I've told you before that we don't do rice and beans on our tacos, I'm the GM and I'm cracking down on that.\" I've never seen that guy before and we did nothing to warrant a public reprimand. We didn't make a scene and told the girl if she couldn't do it then don't. I was so shocked at the very loud, very rude reprimand over politely asking for beans and rice. I just shook my head and said nobody had said anything before.  It's a shame, my boyfriend prefers the tacos here over chipotle but if they charge nearly $4 for a taco and putting rice and beans on it is such a huge issue that it warrants making a scene when we weren't making a scene or even that mad about it, we might have to switch back to chipotle.",

This place is a knock off chipotle or qudoba. Meat was fatty with no flavor, chips not authentic, shortage on ingredients, place was terrible. Definitely wouldn't go back, even if it was free. Best part of our meal was the drink machine. People were nice and the place was clean, just needs some work on the actual food. My wife and I were excited to try this place and left extremely disappointed.",

Chronic Tacos ended up being where my GPS took me.  I wasn't expecting anything grand, I just had to get a meal in.  My expectations were exceeded.  I opted for the Chronic Salad as I was not in the mood for anything overly heavy.  I had them fill the salad bowl with lettuce, beans, rice, chicken, cilantro, shredded cheese, and green salsa.  The chicken was so good!  It was flavorful, juicy, and tender.  The lettuce, beans, rice, cilantro, cheese, and salsa worked in concert with each other and provided good textural and flavor variations bite to bite.  I was very impressed and very pleasantly surprised.",

I've worked in restaurants and I understand that when things get chaotic it's hard to maintain a good flow but from the beginning of our order to when we got our food was 30 minutes. That's 30 minutes of standing in line while the employees were grumbling and angry. One lady was just slamming trays around and kept talking crap about the bearded guy. Like seriously? I don't want to hear that. Bearded guy was actually really nice and was the only employee to make the experience better.   Fake it til you make it, CT.

They told me to order online for \"quicker service\" and BOTH times I've ordered online they haven't even started my order once I get there (at the time stated it'd be ready), so I'm there for 10+ minutes waiting for them to get it together. One time the lady couldn't even find where she put my online order. I've given them 3 chances and each time they've taken way too long, are unprepared, and have no idea what they're doing.

    "text": "My family from California always want to stop by Chronic Tacos when they're in town as they're a hit back home in the seaside towns. It's always been fresh, the staff at this location are always very friendly and helpful, and they serve pick-it-yourself type meals, which are very accommodating to everyone in the group. Now, if you're looking for the deeply marinated, well-seasoned fatty authentic Mexican food you will not find it here. This is more geared towards the healthy crowd and as such, they are much more similar to Chipotle than they are any -Bertos.. As long as you know what you are going to get, I think you'll find their food to be quite good! If you're looking for something more authentic, go down the road a little bit more towards 19th and Peoria and hit up Taco Mich who sells some of the most savory, rich Mexican food I've had in Phoenix!",

    "text": "Was not impressed with our first experience here. From the slow service to the \"cluster F\" ordering system, to the bland food.   We arrived behind 1 person placing their order, and waited. And waited... And waited.... And waited... Not sure if new staff was the issue, or the fact that the poor folks on the assembly line had to keep walking over one another back and forth due to the terrible logistical layout of the prep area. Dishes would pass back and forth through a window into the kitchen or into the mini broiling toaster. Meanwhile people waiting for their dishes to be ready must navigate the flow (albeit slow flow) of other customers who ordered something that was \"at the ready\" moving down the line. They have two topping bars setup for the employees to use, with only one seemingly being used during our visit. The second station appeared to be a waste since they couldn't have been much busier and no one touched anything on it.   I got the Chronic Fries, which took about 10 total minutes to make. I'm not joking. I stood in line fighting people walking by me in line for 10 minutes. 10 of the longest minutes of my life, watching other people get their food.   The process starts out calling the order back through the window. 30-45 seconds or so later someone drops a handful of frozen fries into the fryer. (Frozen? Maybe I'm spoiled from In N Out freshly cut fries. Maybe I'm not and frozen fries should be abolished.) 3 minutes or so go by and my fries are out of the fryer and placed into a pan and placed in the window to cool like a hot pie right out of the oven. And they sit there. And I continue to stand in line watching my fries sit there. Another minute or two go by and someone notices my fries sitting there. \"Anyone order fries?\" they call out. So we get it loaded up with some toppings and cheese and then it goes back into this mini broiler back by the kitchen window. And my fries sit there, and broil, at least that was the intention. Not sure how well the thing works since after about three minutes they take them out with the cheese not fully melted and ask if it's melted enough for me. If I hadn't already been in line for about 10-12 minutes now, I would have loved to have my cheese fully melted, but I was emotionally checked out at that point.   The second star was earned solely based off the pork which was decent albeit a little dry, but sadly not decent enough to ever return.",

My daughter had younger male server. She had chronic fries but he only gave little food, lots of fries, a handful of chicken and 4 or 5 maybe pieces of steak thats never enough for fries. However Cat was amazing. She fixed my food. She continue to serve us. She was patient as my kids continued to ask for condiments without complaint, she was genuine. They did make all my accomodations as necessary. Overall friendly. Very clean..quick service. Juat need the younger men to be considerate with theportions when you are paying $8 for aome french fries. Oh and white Rice was hard.",

Normally I'm not a huge fan of chicken tacos, so I'm surprised that I liked them better than the carne asada. The coke machine squirted me. Yes, literally. I pressed the button for regular lemonade, and the machine squirted orange soda on my white shirt. That was annoying. For being called \"Chronic\" tacos, they weren't really that dope. Despite all this, I think the manager saw that the machine squirted me, and he gave me and my daughter free cinnamon twists. That was nice ! All in all, I'm not super impressed though. Would I come back? If I was forced to lol, but not of my own free will because there is a myriad of better tacos in Phoenix  ***BONUS-- super nice manager saw my review and gave me a free t shirt !

I know specifically how long because I took a phone call when I walked in and when I finally got to the front looked back to see when it was. The staff was not trained properly but no one was on the line directing them, they definitely had enough hands just not using them to their advantage. I.e. 3 people on toppings and 1 setting up tacos/tortillas. The girl would never use the second warmer she would wait for the first tacos to be warm before starting another. This was the biggest reason why it took so long to get through the line. I watched people walk out. After all that wait I wanted a grilled fish taco and had to wait again because it came from the back. The barrier is too high and you had to yell over it and repeat what you wanted so they could hear you. I also ordered a carnitas taco and the carnitas meat was very dry and chewy like it sat on the line for too long. I know they are new so I will try again in a few months but they need to get it together... And quick.",

The food is amazing about 10% of the time, but for months this place has been a trainwreck. Almost all the employees apparently have double digit IQ's and seem lost, confused, and they are hopelessly awkward to interact with. Order your fish taco Baja style and just watch as it becomes a four person meeting trying to remember what Baja style is before they all just give up and ask you what you want on it. The food is crawling with flies and they build orders as they come in, so tortillas and already made items sit on the food line waiting to be paid for. I've stood there in shock watching flies land on food, pans, handles, all as six people in a row get served contaminated food and are too clueless to pay attention to what's going on right in front of them. The flies come in thru the garage door that opens to the patio, which they apparently think is trendy or something even when the place is buzzing with insects like a garbage dump and it's pushing 90 degrees outside. The manager is a really nice guy but seems absentminded, overwhelmed, and just can't get the hang of this place. Today my fish tacos were 9\" long on one taco and 2.5\" long on the other one. The small looked more like a skinny piece of shrimp. Both were chewy and gross. I didn't even eat them. I'm going to Chipotle and Rubios from now on. This place is done taking my money.",

    "text": "Well...i have given this place many chances and the customer service just seems to be getting worse, not better. On the last three visits there have been a problem with each visit. Two weeks ago I was over charged for a large combo. I was charged 2.59 for chips salsa and drink plus an extra $2 for the large drink. I didn't realize it until after she ran my card. The cashier looked dumbfounded and confused as to my concern. Eventually, the manager came and refunded the difference. He didn't seem overly concerned his cashiers were over charging customers.  The next visit I arrive well after lunch rush and before the after dinner, they were out of the pico de gallo. The manager was in the back cleaning and looked unconcerned. The manager(same guy as before) came out and said it would be 2-3 minutes. I choose to wait(I had a feeling i should have said forget it at that point). 10 minutes later he comes out with the pico to put on my cold burrito. No apology for the wait. Pay for my food and go to the drink dispenser and its almost all of the low calorie options were empty. Mentioned it to the cashier and the manager came and gave excuses as to why it was empty. I couldn't deal with it at this point and i asked for my money back. Went to Potbelly two doors down. Came back again today hoping, begging that they could get it together because their food is good.  Made it through the order process and when i asked for an extra cup of salsa with my chips and salsa he (same manager) said there would be an extra charge for the extra cup of salsa. He said this was a new policy. At this point, I just sat down and ate my burrito and half my chips because i ran out of salsa. I tried to give this place a shot because its locally owned by a guy named Brad I believe. I am for the local guy over the corporate giants but i doubt i will be back. Go to Chipotle or Potbelly instead.",

The girl helping us was in training she also didn't know much about the menu. His burrito was unbelievable small almost all rice.

Ran out of green sauce it was 2:30 in the afternoon on a Friday... Were they making more? I say work on your customer service more, clean up the tables so people can sit and eat.

Apperently the girl working the register at 2:35 pm on this day doesn't like her job one bit!  Rude as could be, and not only to me, but the 4 customers in front of me!  No smile, no kindness what so ever!  Shape up young lady or I fear your job status may change in the near future!  This was my firsr and last visit!  Grunpy people shouldn't work with the public!  Managers....this one will run off more customers than she'll bring in for sure!!!",

How do you average almost $13.00 for that? The tacos were the size of your palm, literally. There was almost nothing on them. I guess that's why they make it with two tortillas to make up for the lack of food you pay for. The manager looked like she was intimidating the girl making my food so she was scared to put anything on it. Not worth $3.25 + tax a piece. The chips were good but mind you it was a large. They gave me a 4 oz salsa cup filled up to 2 oz. To top off the whole visit the manager had her kids there working. There was a little boy, had to be no older than 8-9, come out from the kitchen to the front. No hairnet but was wearing gloves? As a 10 1/2 year culinary chef I know that this is obviously unsanitary and illegal. I wonder if the owner is aware of what is going on over there? I've heard many people talk about this place and every one of them has said that they're not going back. I felt like I got ripped off to make up for building costs' of the place. What a joke.",

The staff was exceptionally helpful in making suggestions. They were very knowledgable about what was in their food and that was allowed me to make the best choices for me. The idea is you choose what you want (taco, burrito, nachos, etc) and then choose the toppings you want. However all of this was just the frosting on the cake. The best thing about chronic taco was their food! Their chicken tacos were divine. My refried beans with extra cheese was made perfectly. Their homemade chips and the medium Salsa- YUM! My favorite though had to be the Spanish rice. It was heaven in my mouth.. This was a favorite for my family and I will definitely be back for next weeks Taco Tuesday.",

So food was  good, girl at cash register didn't know how to pour the beer, thankfully some one else came along and did it, and we had to ask 2 times for our chips and salsa, which the salsa was not really salsa...so the staff..is so so...I hope it was just opening jitters and I will come back in a few months to try again..hopefully this place will work out the little kinks they had tonight.",

I ordered two beer battered shrimp tacos. They were served on two layers of cold corn tortillas. I chose my toppings after helping assist my children with their orders, then we sat down with our foods. One issue immediately... Onions on the kids' steak taco meals. The beef is cooked with diced onions. Sauteed onions could easily been seen on these small soft tacos. I don't know about other families, but my younger children are repelled but just the sight. I spent a few minutes removing them from their meals only to find many more in their sides of refried beans. It took some coaxing, but I got them to at least eat their tacos. I found my food rather cold at this point... But I grabbed some hot salsa and started eating. The shrimp tasted pretty good. However I am a TexMex fan and like my tacos heavy seasoned with flavor. These tacos were rather mild and lacking in flavor... So was the salsa. :( this fifty dollar chronic taco outing was a bust in my book.  If I do give this Chipolte wannabe restaurant another chance it will for sure be without my onion hating kiddos.",

We walked in,  place seemed okay,  then  we stood in line with one person in  front of us for about five minutes. When it was finally our turn to order the lady was very pleasant. I wish I knew her name,  she was the only thing about the place that wasn't terrible. As we move on down the line adding to our tacos and burrito the staff behind the counter seemed very disgruntled and was very rude to not just myself but the customer in front of us. When it was time to pay,  we waited about another 5 minutes for my girlfriends burrito to be ready. She ordered a shrimp burrito which for some reason takes extra long to make. $20.35 later and I was left with cold tacos,  stale chips,  and a burrito where the shrimp tasted off. As if overpaying for crap food wasn't bad enough,  the dining area was filthy. Food trays and wrappers left all over the place,  food crumbs and mess littered table tops as well as seats. We found the only place that wasn't filthy. While eating we saw four employees take a break almost at the same time. One kid who worked there walked around and picked up trays,  then went outside never to be seen again. Food crumbs still everywhere. One employee sat fairly close to us,  kicking back,  on break I assume. So it wasn't a mystery to staff that this place looked like a train wreck. Bottom line,  I will never come here again,  and I will be sure to tell all of my friends in this area to never come here.",

There was barely any pico de Gallo in either section. Then order a drink to find out that the soda machine that is supposed to have choices galore barely had any available. Most all of the sugar free options weren't available. I'm gonna say that this has happened EVERY time we have gone there. I gave up getting drinks from here but wanted to try today. Just like every visit into this place they didn't have what I wanted AGAIN! Come on Chronic Tacos. Fill your soda machine and have your meat fresh and ready for your customers!",

For instance, I got a Cali carne asada burrito that was missing the meat.... on a carne asada burrito. The next go around I ordered a veggie Cali burrito and most everything I selected (that was clearly on the receipt) was missing. Incredibly disappointing to get home and see your order is not what you selected. It honestly feels like they think they can get away with that. A little bit of a rip off of you ask me which is unfortunate because it truly tastes good. Unfortunately, won't be eating here again.",

    "text": "So....my coworker who sits directly across from me comes here all the time.  Everything he had brought back has looked good, so I decided that I needed to check it out.  I drove down today, parked, walked in and scoped out the menu for a minute.  I saw a \"California Burrito\" and it was calling my name.  I lived in the land of California Burritos (San Diego) for about 10 years, so I was hoping that Chronic Tacos version could come close to what I was used to.    I stood there and talked with Andy for a few minutes while he was waiting for the fries to finish (freshly fried fries...good start to any CA burrito) and then we got down to business.  They stick a flour tortilla between a little press to warm it up.  The fries were layered perfectly, and then Andy started hooking up my burrito with the carne asada.  I went with a pretty traditional CA burrito (carne asada, fries, cotija and jack cheese, a little pico, sour cream and guacamole).  This burrito was fat!  Paid Andy my money (10% off with Yelp check in!) and took it back to work.  Here is how it was............  California Burrito-  The sheer size of this thing was impressive!  It was a beast!  I took it to go and I had about a 15 minute drive back to work, so I couldn't eat it immediately.  I think if I would have ate it there in the shop, it would have been a little bit better.  The fries had time to settle and weren't as crispy as they looked coming out of the fryer.  The carne asada was just a tad dry and had a little different type of seasoning on it.  It was good, but not great.  The rest of the ingredients were very good though.  Melted cheese, a ton of guacamole and sour cream.  It was a pretty solid CA burrito.  Best burrito I have had so far in AZ (that's not saying a whole lot lol!)  Overall, I thought it was pretty good.  If this was in San Diego, this would be a 3 star burrito.  Because it's in AZ, it gets a 3.5-4 star review.  Customer service was excellent.  Andy thanked me for coming in and said that he hoped to see me again soon.  He said that he loves seeing repeat customers and recognizable faces.  I appreciated that and I'm sure at some point when I am craving a burrito, I will make my way back down here.  There are other things on the menu I would like to try out.",

They sell a bottle of hot sauce but don't offer any at the tables or anywhere in the restaurant- call me crazy but I like hot sauce for my Mexican food.   Had a small burrito, it was okay. I'll come back for a bowl sometime but first impression was not a wow. Bummer",

    "text": "I absolutely love the location on Bell & 3rd Street. This location on Peoria is okay, but it could definitely use some help.  First, it takes way too long to get food made.  No sense of urgency from the kitchen staff, and the youngsters working at the counter don't seem to care either way. They move slow, all the while chatting with one another and looking annoyed any time a customer approaches the counter.  Next, the carne asada is not very good quality, which I don't understand. The Bell location has the most amazing carne ever, so one would assume it will taste similar at the Peoria location. Not so much. It is mostly fat, which is not acceptable when you are charging what you are charging. Half of it gets thrown away due to it being inedible. Please find out how the other location prepares it and compare. The rice is never fully cooked here either. Also, I hate to point this out, but I think it is important for people to know. The last time I ate here (a few days ago), there was a long black facial hair on my taco shell. Gross. I happened to notice one of the cooks has a black beard. That is fine and all, but make sure your cooks are wearing something to prevent that from happening. It tends to cause one to lose their appetite when finding someone else's hair in their food.  Even though this location is much closer to my house, I may just make the extra trip to go to the other location. I know I can count on quality every time I go there.",

The only issue i had was in asking for fresh carne asada cuz what they had in the bin looked old. The guy said he didnt have anymore but you are literally a taco shop...how are you not going to have more steak?! He offered to throw it on the grill to heat it up. Cuz thats just what i want...old chewy overcooked steak. He even related...but still didnt get fresh meat. Then i made it a combo. Now its partially my fault that i didnt get a large drink cuz i didnt speak up. However, the lady checking me out should have asked. I work in service myself so i get its just the food industry but think about things like this when ordering your food...would u want to experience these things? That large drink could have added more to your profit.",

But this was a let down. This is similar to Chiplote as picking a bowl and burrito with choice of meat and toppings.  I ordered the small burrito with Al pastor. Now I love Al pastor, big fan. But this Al pastor tasted watery? It had a very watered down and weird after taste. It left a film coating in my mouth which I didnt like. The refried beans and spanish rice was just alright. I feel I could cook some at home that tasted better. Pico was really good.  I also ordered the potato taco. This was the best part out of my whole meal. Just mashed potatos deep fried in a tortilla. If I came back it'd be just for those. Other than that I'd pass it up for Chiplote which I dont really care for either but I know there will be flavor there. The service was really good. Very friendly and helpful when picking what to order. They werent busy when we had walked in, but everything seemed clean with a lot of decent space to sit and move around.",

I had a chicken taco and a potato taco.  The chicken taco was good but the potato was deep fried and came from the back, then sealed shut so you can't really add salsas and fresh toppings.  My b/f got the meat torta and did not like it.  The meat had little flavor and it was packed with white rice??? And no guacamole; he was almost angry about a torta stuffed with rice.

The girl put onions on my burrito with out me asking then was upset I didn't want them. Others at the tables next to me had the same experience. Maybe with time it will get better. The food was so so. I would not go back.",

My primary concern is that if the visible area such as the dining room (complete with overflowing trash receptacle) and the prep area lack cleanliness, it leaves one to question the condition of the kitchen which is not visible to the customer.",

Ten minutes turned into twenty without the drink, after asking again about the drink they said they were out of that specific beer. I asked the cashier if she could return the amount for the beer and I would just buy a fountain drink. She then replied with a rude \"I can't do that\" and handed me a soda cup. I decided not to argue any further so ended up paying about 3$ extra for a soda. Won't go back again, the tacos are not worth the horrible service.",

    "text": "Well, this was definitely a BAD and regrettable choice to have meal from Chronic Tacos. My classmates and I agreed to try out a new place that was in the remote are and when we took a glance, we thought-hey why not give this place a shot. However, we were greatly disappointed. We ended up beating the lunch crowd by mere minutes and when we took a look at the menu, we thought-this sounds interesting. Little did we know that this place is unable to execute when it comes to service and serving. We waited and waited and waited while the few employes had problems with moving back and forth without organization in keeping a cohesive momentum. Which led to a bit of chaos with guests ending up being staggered and wondering, okay do I stand here while this person serving me just headed over there for whatever reason and then is helping someone else without completing the order? The steak was inedible due to it was Extremely TOUGH, ROUGH and very difficult to chew. The black beans were even worse than the steak with it being HARD and not cooked thoroughly, this was throughout my burrito. I can't understand how what seems to be soooo simple could be soooo WRONG. There were four of us and we didn't realize our orders were inedible until after attempting to consume our lunch since we took it to go. I literally only took a bite and could not believe I spent approximately $8 that ended up thrown into the rubbish. The food absolutely should be tested out by the ownership/management prior to offering it to the public. Unfortunately, there will be a ZERO return factor and a ZERO referral. Classmates that opted for chicken indicated it was very salty.",

My three star review can be attributed to one of the employee interactions I had. When I was picking the ingredients for my burrito, she asked me what cheese I wanted and I asked her what type they had. She listed the names and I didn't understand what she said so I asked her to repeat it. She looked at me and repeated it in a way that made me feel like I shouldn't have even asked to begin with. I try to give people working in retail the benefit of the doubt because I worked in retail for years but sometimes the attitude is really uncalled for.",

I appreciate people who are on their game and still care about the customer.   I also got a good bye and hey my name is Chris and look forward to seeing you again. That is awesome and yes I will be back.   I got the small carne asada burrito with chips and queso on the side. It was good and I thought the pricing was fair. I also got a 10% off check in for my first time I like that.   Food was good atmosphere was good, good service, good food. I'm not sure what's up with the lower reviews but it made no sense to me. Glad I went in. One more thing, I didn't feel like crap afterward which makes me think that the quality of the ingredients are great.",

Now, let me be upfront and honest, I have been here a handful of times and I always order the same thing. Potato Tacos. OMG, they are so good. Mashed potatoes in a taco shell, deep fried, topped with all of of your favorite toppings (I go the cheese, cilantro, onion, cabbage, salsa verde route). Only once have I been disappointed, they were cold in the center, but that won't stop me from returning.   The menu is pretty extensive and everything looks really good. They even have breakfast burritos for the morning crowd, but I am unsure of what time they open. Service is friendly and quick and I'm pretty sure they have beer specials.  Definitely worth checking out. I'll be back soon.",

So I made my selection, bean and cheese with brown rice (because I couldn't choose \"no rice\") with onions and cilantro. When it arrived, it was not what I selected and hit had about 2 tablespoons of beans in it total, and jasmine white rice in it. What a waste of an order. If I just wanted to eat rice I would have chosen Chinese food.  The Baja sauce was ranch dressing with Saracha in it. For real.  The \"baja sauce\", onions and cilantro came outside the burrito. Way to ruin the whole concept of a burrito. The food should be INSIDE the tortilla so you can eat it with your hands. There should be BEANS as the major ingredient in a BEAN BURRITO. This is not rocket surgery.",

Been wanting to try since they opened. Finally decided too on a early Friday evening. Our first clue when walking inside how are experience was going to be was the place was empty. Absolutely no other customers.   I have to say the 2 ladies working the line were great. Both were pleasant and likeable. A star for each of them.  Husband ordered a carne asada burrito, I ordered 2 fish tacos, kid ordered a cheese quesadilla.  The concept is exactly like the guys down the street on the corner. My fish was fried to order.   Other half said his burrito had no flavor even with the addition of salsa. My tacos looked good but the fish had a odd taste and were extremely soggy. The tortilla had more texture. The guac that I asked for on the side was a salt bomb. I only ate about 3/4th of one taco, the other ended up in the trash. Nothing special about about the quesadilla. Chips that came with the dilla were the best part of the meal and the Coke Freestyle machines.  This place could be great if the food had lived up to par. The vibe was good and service was above average. We probably won't be back and it might explain why it was still empty when we left. If you are a beer drinker domestic bottles are only $2.50.",

At least not on what I ordered. I liked the fact that they have limes, and cotija cheese, two of my favorite toppings for tacos and/or burritos. Got the Cali burrito, ate it so fast that I didn't even get to snap a pic. This place is good, and I'll def be back. Dude at the counter was friendly. The missing star is because the ice machine wasn't working right, and because fast food rarely blows my mind enough for that fifth star.    Pssst... I'll give the fifth star back if you open up shop in the east valley, near Mesa or Gilbert.",

    "text": "**3.5 stars**  Chipotle but actually authentic-ish mexican food?  I got the giant burrito bowl with al pastor meat. YUM! Same concept at chipotle: you stand in line, choose the style you like (bowl, burrito, taco, salad, etc), choose your meat (or doubled), beans, veggies, salsas, and toppings. I had both the red and green salsas. Both were tasty, NONE were spicy which is why I gave this place a lower rating. I was a little disappointed in that because I CRAVE spicy salsa. The green one was my favorite one out of the two.   Portions were huge and filling. I had 2 meals left over in my bowl after eating a quick (but filling) lunch. Price was good for the amount of food given.  The staff was SUPER friendly. I can't get over how helpful they were. Even in a fast paced chain, the servers still made time to explain each selection to me and make some perfect recommendations for me. They even had time to come by to my table and make sure I was doing well and to see if I was enjoying my food. 5+ stars for customer service!   Environment: 5/5  Food: 3/5 Price: 5/5 Service: 5/5",

I understand that it's going to be busy because it just opened and that's natural. Everything seemed very unorganized. The menu is very hard to understand and doesn't give a lot of detail about their food. As we waited in line, one of the gals that worked there was passing out samples of their chicken taquitos. It just tasted like boiled chicken wrapped in a deep fried corn tortilla. Had absolutely no flavor. I ordered the bowl- rito, the rice was not even cooked all the way and I was spitting out hard bits and I was eating. My boyfriend ordered the California burrito. His order took 5 min longer to prepare because it was sent to the back for prep. He obviously was not happy about that. It was also a total disaster to eat, very messy.  So, I'm just going to pas this place up and go to chipotle instead.",

Plus it was taco Tuesday so even better. Chicken and asada were good, al pastor was amazing. My son had the quesadilla which you can't really go wrong with, at least to a finicky 3 year old. My only thumbs down is th at there are no juice or milk selections for the kids menu. Have to go with fountain drink options which I'm not a fan of. HOWEVER, I will say I was way impressed when the girl managing for the guys in the back to make him some fresh pineapple juice. Amazing service for them to even think of doing that for us. I would prob also like it if you had the option to get rice and /or beans instead of chips with the kids meal.  Bottom line is, food is delicious, quirks are expected when a place just opens up so I won't harsh ice tea machine not working.  Can't wait to be back for some yummy fish tacos",

The first time I visited was for lunch and the line was so long, waiting over 30 minutes in line just to order, seemed a bit unorganized, but I chalked it up to being brand new.  Second time was even worse.  Waiting in line way too long again,  things go so chaotic as far as who ordered what as some things must be ordered from the kitchen, which means you are waiting longer than a person behind you....staff doesn't know who ordered what.  Utter chaos.  I probably will not be back, even though the food is really good, I can't deal with the chaos.  The food line was also really dirty yesterday, and I saw an employee take a huge scoop of something out of the salsa and throw it in the trash, and then use that same salsa to dress tacos.

Two people ahead of us, no one sitting in the dining area, we were there for 30 minutes before we got to start telling our order. This isn't the first time either.  The food is good.

Owner is on site and super nice hard working guy. You can see his staff respects and likes him.   Reading some of the other reviews I think people are being too harsh, when a restaurant opens it takes a little time for the crew to be performing as a team. Instead of writing a bad review talk to the manager and let them correct their problem. Revisit the establishment and then write your review!   I hate to see such a great place getting negative reviews when they just needed some time to learn and start functioning smoothly!   Good job Chronic staff and owner!",

    "text": "I've been waiting with bated breath to see which restaurant would occupy the final spot in the shopping center by my house. When Chronic Tacos was announced, I was excited at the prospect of an alternative to Chipotle. Unfortunately, in the vein of Smashburger, Chronic Tacos expects you to pay a premium for subpar food. I can't begin to count the ways paying $9 for a \"California burrito\" is wrong, but soggy fries is definitely one of them.  Customer service is also lacking. This place has only been open for two weeks, but the workers expect everyone who walks through the door to be a veteran. I repeatedly had to ask the server to describe what my options were. No, I don't know that the white cheese is called \"Oaxaca.\" I also had no idea that brown rice wasn't available.   The ordering system is strange. too. Instead of bringing all the ingredients for menu items to the front of the store, some have to be cooked to order in the back. The result is that you have to step out of line to wait for an item to be cooked to order, then back in when it comes time to tell the food worker which toppings you want.  While I will readily admit that the Chronic Fries are delicious -- and appropriately priced -- I do not feel, having eaten an entire California Burrito, that the price was on point. Chipotle does the same thing for almost $3 less, though with fewer topping options.  In the end, I feel like Chronic Tacos's entire business model revolves around asking customers to pay more to avoid dealing with Mexicans. But if I want good Mexican food, those are exactly the people I want making it! There are also a dearth of cheaper Mexican food options in the area. I will try any restaurant once, but I won't be back here. I can get a California for $4 less right down the street.",

    "text": "I went into this location on three separate occasions.   1) seemed fine, the workers didn't know how to explain the menu so I kind of stuck to ordering a burrito (chipotle) style. Tasted really good but I paid a sold $17.78 for a burrito meal.. should have gone to chipotle and treated a friend to a meal for that price!   2) gave it another chance since my co workers hadn't been in. I and another coworker ordered burritos so no issues, tasted good. My other co worker got a quesadilla w/ veggies.. They did not have the veggies ready so her order had to go back into the kitchen... Needless to say, I ordered the same thing as last time, paid $10 this time around and my co worker finally got her quesadilla with veggies AFTER my co worker had to complain to the manager...twice! And as we were finishing up with our burritos. She also said it was bland and not worth the overpriced amount she paid!   3) went in on a Thursday night, there were ppl in there but no line, ordered my usual and they didn't have any rice made, said to wait 2-3, I waited 7-9 mins. and they were finally able to toss some from the kitchen over into my burrito,  the employees looked pissed, lazy and not wanting to be there and the gentleman that checked me out or any other staff did not even apologize for the delay in not having their main option, wtf? Paid $10 this time too, had the burrito but it was very BLAND, Disgusting. Tossed it !! as we were leaving the manager like figure asked how it was and I said it was ok! He apologized because he had seen us waiting for a while and we said ok.. Then he came chasing me down as I was sitting in my car with a free Taco with a meal or something. No thank you.   Honestly, gave them 3 tries, service is horrible, food is decent, good luck figuring out what you want to order since no one knows to really help you.. And if you order something from the back kitchen, good luck getting it in time!",

The fish in my fish taco was completely dried out.  We ordered a cheese crisp and the girl didn't clean old melted cheese off the press before she put in our cheese crisp.   Gross. Finally,  the whole time we were in line the two girls assembling the meals were throwing food trimmings etc at a trash can and food was splashing and spraying everywhere.  If any of us gets food poisoning tonight I won't be surprised.   We should have walked out.   This place was totally disgusting tonight and will never see my business again. NO STARS NO STARS",

I was forced to buy a lunch I did not want from another restaurant. I called the establishment to let them know how I felt... But of course their phone was busy.   I visited this place in the past and enjoyed their tacos and had no issues before. This time I felt non important and I do not feel like returning.   Don't expect a quick lunch if you don't order just tacos.  Update: The manager of the store did ended up contacting me back by phone after I left a complaint on the company's webpage. He offered me a free chronic fries. I appreciate the offer and them taking the time to get back to me. Maybe after some time I may give them another try.",

    "text": "When I was in the restaurant I thought for sure it was going to be good. I got a Cali burrito so they fried up some French fries fresh to put in and loaded up this burrito, it was huge. But when I started eating I was very underwhelmed, it's definitely not bad, just average. But when you're an average burrito in Phoenix I'm probably not going back because there's plenty of good burrito spots no matter where you go.",

By the time she got to the machine it became apparent she didn't know what she was doing and would have to call the owner.  Meanwhile, tacos got cold and soggy.  Bad enough, the carne asada had run out and I got cold remnants.  Good bye!",

This was my daughter and mine first time here and probably the last time we go there. They could not even greet us as we waited right there in front of them so our business went elsewhere. There was a black guy that was waiting when we got there and they paid him no mind but we watched several hispanic men go up and ORDERED...i am not one to pull racism but it sure felt like it...i really hope not cause that not the way to run a company in my book. We will never go back so they lost a potiential regular customer.",
