Although prices are not too bad. Plenty of food per serving. I had the salad with the pork, and my husband tried two tacos. One pork one ground beef on hard shell. We went with my sister ava get husband who had 3 tacos and the mahi mahi. I tried the sangria which was very good. The margarita (house) however was blah...to much margarita mix...The server was slightly rude not really helpful. We asked that instead of having to get up every time she brought a chip refill if she would also bring the salsa that comes with it as well. She said no and that we could refill it ourselves. She could have been more customer oriented. That's a big thing for me is customer service ave she definitely failed. However,  The regular house salsa and pico de gallo were the best things on the salsa bar. Loved that we could grab radishes and cabbage for the tacos. I would go back to take advantage of happy hour and maybe have a snack.",

But when you think of having to seat yourself, you probably imagine a fast food restaurant.  This place is pretty classy and tastefully decorated.  Meals are cheap.  I ordered the cheese quesadilla appetizer as my main dish for $3.75 and it was humongous.  I was only able to eat half of it.  Happy hour specials are good too.  I got a margarita for $3.50.  Service was great and quick. The only down side to this place are the menu options.  There is not much to choose from.  However, it does seem like you can add and substitute items which creates a little more variety with the menu.  I would definitely come here again in the near future.",

Their happy hour is great, and they have an awesome range of margaritas and beers.   I also have to say that they are SUPER willing to help you plan an event. They've offered to set aside the patio for a large party, and they really seem to take the time to help you without being difficult. I never felt like I was an inconvenience to make requests of them. They have wonderful customer service.   Get there early on Friday/Saturdays, because it WILL fill up. The food is great for the price and quality.   Also, try the taco sauce on the salsa bar. It's spicy, but SO GOOD.",

While in Chandler to visit family, we had a hankering for Mexican food.  I lived in Chandler for a few years, so I'm familiar with El Zocalo, Serrano's etc.  Wanting to try something new and not wanting to run up a big bill for drinks, and checking the Google reviews (sorry YELP, I definitely paid for it later) we chose Juan Jaime's.  WHAT A MISTAKE.  Ok, ok.  Yes the Happy Hour Margaritas are passable for $5, and for cheap drinks I would recommend J.J.'s  But the food was horrible!  Frozen dinner Mexican food. Taco Bell quality food.  Bad. Bad. Bad.  I've eaten Mexican food all over the West...but Juan Jaime's ranks up there with the worst.  Happy Hour cheap drinks/chips and salsa? Yes.  Food?  No. No way.  Pass!  Run for your life! Horrible.  And not only that?  It's just not very good at all!",

I work graves, so I also appreciate that this place serves food until 1am because my sleep and eating schedule operate way out of bounds of the normal hours of operation for most places. Portion sizes are excellent for the amount you pay. I had the steak tacos and they were a little under seasoned and dry, truthfully, but the house salsa fixed it right up. I also wasn't a big fan of the guacamole, but that's a personal preference. We were fans of the rice and received beans though. Super tasty! My boyfriend had the chicken tacos and he liked them quite a bit. Our waitress (didn't catch her name) was very nice and attentive. We're not drinkers, so we really appreciate that she didn't push us to buy alcohol like some places can do. Overall, I'd check this place out again and try some of the other stuff they have to offer (I was excited to see they serve their taco salad in a wheat bowl!).",

Later in the evening it can get fairly busy here and the noise level definitely increases. Of course, the tequila probably contributes towards that...  The food is good - nothing super fancy, but quick and simple. At lunch I usually go for the Tacos Trio (chicken), but I've also had their burritos and they are also good . They have a great salsa bar with a lot of options. The chips are okay - like someone else on here mentioned they can be greasy at times. I would say I come here more for the happy hour than I actually do for dinner.  The bartenders stay on top of everyone and they have a very nice selection of tequilas. Happy hour prices are competitive and the crowd that hangs out here is pretty social.   The service here is excellent - never had a bad experience. I have to give a shout-out to Kaitlyn who took good care of us today during lunch. If every place had a server like her, life would be good.  Definitely worth a visit - especially if you are looking to decompress after a long day or want to meet up with friends for a drink or two at the end of the day.",

Keep in mind there were maybe 5 people in the whole place. We ended up leaving. This past Tuesday 3/13, another friend talked me into going there as it was close. There was no room at the bar so we sat outside. We ordered two skinny margaritas with a top shelf tequila, we they came out my friend had hers served in a point glass and mine in a pilsner glass.  Bartender saw us make faces and came out and said we only have two sizes in glasses, it's all I have and walked back inside. Next we order, I just got a single taco as I do judge a TACO place on how they make their carne asada. WOW was I disappointed, no clue what type of meat they use but I am guessing this is what canned dog food tastes like. The texture was wrong and taste was horrible. Knew something was wrong based on how quick the food came out. I will never return to this place. Oh the margaritas was all mix..",

A quality margargita made with 1800 and Cointreau is $10. House margaritas are $4...yep.  Based on freshness and value, highly rate Juan Jamie's, and will return.

It wasn't all THAT bad, but not great  either.    I judge Latin-style restaurants on their chips and salsa. If it's not good, I know what to expect from their kitchen. With that said.. the chips were greasy and salsa tasted like Pace picante.   I had the two taco plate of grilled chicken and steak tacos with re-fried beans and rice. The grilled steak taco had good flavor, but the chicken was VERY dry. I added lime and salsa to try and moisten it up. All and all...it was decent, but not any better quality than a late night taco place.   Service was ok.",

I would recommend getting the 3 tacos first time you go, try steak, chicken and the mahi is a must its a great start to see what your favorite would be. I love the mahi fish its defiantly one of my fave. second time you come go with the platter of your favorite, you can do a combo like steak and mahi platter is what i get, it comes with rice and beans oh and the rice is the best BTW. When you get the chips and salsa ask for spicy bean dip its not on the menu so you have to ask, its beans mixed with their green chili and its the best bean dip i have ever had. I go there like once or twice a week its worth the drive even to the one in Scottsdale that one is also really nice the bar is open to the outside so it feels like your almost on the beach in Mexico.",

My boyfriend got the carnitas taco and said it was really good too. I wasn't too impressed with the salsas. The green one was my favorite. The atmosphere was great for either a quiet afternoon lunch, but I could also see it being a really fun place for night life too! I can't wait to go back and order a margarita!

Juan Jaime's is a quaint little spot next to the corporate powerhouse that is Outback Steakhouse but next door to my favorite masseuse. Atmosphere is A+, Drinks A+ (i love a variety of tequila), and the food is a solid A. I've had the opportunity to work for another local Mexican food restaurant that I won't name for respect purposes but I'm sure you've been \"UP\" the street from one no matter where you are in the valley, and that combined with my childhood filled with great Tex-Mex cuisine can tell you that Juan Jaime does things right. Mexican food is a hard cuisine to perfect due to the variety of preparation techniques, and he nailed it! Salsa...amazing! And it's not overpriced food or drink!  I truly hope that Juan Jaime continues to provide a service and product that makes Chefs like myself feel comfortable supporting local business!!  SUPPORT LOCAL...THEY ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS!!",

Ample fillings in the burrito and the red sauce made up for the salsa in terms of heat.   Not a tequila drinker, but looking at the bar they have plenty of selection on that front. Could have had a few more bourbons, but hey... what did I expect.   Overall, a nice place to eat, drink, and enjoy an evening.",

How have I not been here?\" I got the carnitas burrito and it was soooo good tomorrow I'm going back to try something else. My server I'll call \"J-Slim\" was pretty dope not bugging or rushing and at 8pm seating yourself with fast service was str8 legit. There's the patio and I'd totally have sat out there but I was half watching the basketball game. It was a good time and I'll mosdef sit outside next time. Cheers yo!",

If you are like me and don't care that much about tequila, it was okay.  For a place that touts their tacos and tequilas, they fell short on the taco side.  I tried the two taco platter with rice and black beans.  My chicken taco was delicious and flavorful, but the steak taco was not as good.  It tasted like they had put the same seasoning on both.  I did try a margarita with a pomegranate tequila topper.  It was strong but tasty.  They also had a salsa bar, but of the four salsa they had there was only one mild option and the rest were super spicy.  The prices were reasonable and the staff was friendly but scarce.  I ate here because I was in the neighborhood, but I didn't find anything that would draw me back to eat here again.",

They get 4-stars from me because they serve a good marg. Regrettably, too many local places seem to waive a cheap bottle of tequila over the ubiquitous ice cream machine-like contraption that holds the house margs, and pass off a Kool-Aid mix as a margarita.

It's not terrible but let's be honest it's absolutely nothing to reccomend.   Ordered margaritas...tasted like they were a mix. For good lords sake it's a Mexican place. Do those right.  And they are little.  Also ordered the three amigos. Salsa. Guacamole and queso. The only thing I'd eat again is the queso. Delicious! We doctored the quac with the salsa and made it edible. It's the stuff they buy predone.   Refried beans tasted canned.   Ordered the burrito enchilada style with chicken. Mixed the red and green sauce on top. And cheese sauce on side.   All sauces mixed is a good flavor. Chicken was chewy.   Rice was bland.   Had to ask for waters.   Idk I wouldn't go again, my boyfriend said he would. But he had a little green today.  Not for me.   Service was ....there.",

I ordered the steak tacos (hold the onion) and unfortunately was less than impressed. ***I was raised to always appreciate a chefs effort.*** However I COULD HAVE GOTTEN BETTER FOOD FROM A FOOD TRUCK! Not sure how long the meat had been sitting out but they definitely overcompensate on spice the way McDonald's does with salt on heat lamp french fries.   Thank goodness I was able to add flavor to the taco with my guac and salsa. But after one taco I regretted my choice and thought... I should have had a salad :/  I will definitely give them another try but perhaps try the chicken or mahi next time :)",

However they were tasty, especially with the help of the salsa bar - the salsa bar is awesome.  I will definitely return when I am in the mood for some quick tacos.",

Being non- familiar with the area, I went with this spot because of so many comments of their \"happy hour\". I really don't know how this spot is... 4 stars, gotta admit that yelp failed me this time :(  Atmosphere: nice and modern, felt kind of like Buffalo Wild Wings with the bar and TVs... Maybe it's because of the name, I was expecting a more authentic environment. The waitress was fairly attentive and prompt with our water and orders  Food: +self-serve salsa bar woo hoo: most of the sauces were decent, not really spicy for my standards +HH blended margarita was pretty good, it was $4 or $5 and a little bit of alchy in it +the warm queso dipping for chips was pretty good!  - so not impressed with everything else... - dry rice with dry enchiladas and tasteless refried beans - the \"salad\" in my bf's combo was the saddest little salad portion I've even seen... -overpriced for the quality of food we got  I will not come back here for the food. BUT if BWW is so too crowded and you want a nice modern restaurant with a full bar and ooooookay non-authentic Mexican to watch some sporting events, this might be the place for you!",

I've given it three tries, and it's been three fails.  I won't go back.  Order #1: Take-out nachos.   They take chips from the grocery store, throw shredded cheese on them, and microwave them.  They taste just like you'd imagine they'd taste....like warm cardboard.    Order #2: Take-out chicken tacos.  Super dry meat, very bland tacos.  Without some salsa they would have been inedible.  The only saving grace is that the salsa is decent, as are the refried beans.  Order #3: Take out carnitas tacos.  Better than the chicken, however the taco plate comes with three tacos and when I got back to work with my food I found they had only given me two tacos.  Funny...I didn't get a discount on the price....just got less food for no reason.  Yeah...this place isn't good.  Go somewhere else....save your money.",

We drag my kid, Barrington, all over the store, and he's screaming the whole way, but really, who cares?  Then we head to Juan Jaime's for half a bottle of tequila and a couple of tortilla chips, and Barrington is still screaming, but again, who cares?  I  had a great time and jacked the credit card up six- or eight-hundred dollars.  I forget, but I don't pay the bill so whatever.    Man.  There is a whole other world out there, and I'm glad I don't live in it.  But sadly, sometimes I catch the effects of it.  I am so glad we finally tried Juan Jaime's.  Ladena has always been our server, and she is awesome.  She makes sure those drinks don't get empty and is quick with the food and the check as well.    I have a new love.  It's their pomegranate margarita.  Delicious!  Right now I can't feel my elbows or my kneecaps and I'm pretty sure I only weigh 110 pounds.  That's a great drink!  We've also had the street dog lunch special, the carnitas and beef tacos, the nachos, and the cheese enchiladas.  Everything is tasty and reasonably priced.    Next time we'll have to try the patio where we can then be entertained by all the bad drivers on Chandler Blvd.  GREAT place!",

The place wasn't very crowded and that worried me a bit but I figured what the hell.   I'm glad I went in. I had a super burrito, enchilada style and a ice tea. The waiter was very friendly and was very attentive but not over bearing. Although it wasn't crowded I'm pretty sure he wss the only one waiting on tables and he did a great job.  He brought me chips and a mild salsa and informed me they have a salsa bar and it has a variety of different degrees of heat to them. He even explained which was which. I like extra spicy but tried 3 different ones. They all had good flavor.   He brought my burrito out fairly quickly. But , again, it wasn't that crowed. The burrito was very good. I choose ground beef and it was good. Very tender. Lol. And it was a big burrito.   My bill came to right around $13 so the price is very reasonable. You almost spend that at Taco Bell. Next time I'll try the carne asada.  It's a good place with good service, and good prices. Oh, it was very clean too. You can't go wrong with that combination.",

They were not overly salty, other folks enjoyed the salsa bar Queso was tasty and came with 1 free refill HH on drinks, ~$5 Tecates We didn't have to ask the Server to break the checks by couple  CONS Order of beans came out incorrect, server fixed it Entrees was just \"meeh\" we ordered taco platters and enchiladas My enchilada was very...dainty, not a lot of green sauce and wasn't filled with much cheese  The \"A-OK\" rating is based mostly on the food, it's a chill place to get a quick bite and catch up with friends but will not be our \"go-to\" for future HH's",

Probably the best thing about this place is value for your money.  Yes, you do have to pay $1.75 for chips and salsa, but when you can get a burrito for $6.95, it ends up being a great value.  With a few sprinkles of salt, the chips were good and the salsa bar gives you the chance to enjoy different flavors with your chips (and meal.)  I had the carnitas burrito which was tasty, but was made unevenly such that all the rice was on one side and all of the carnitas and beans were on the other side.  Not too big of a deal; I just had to be strategic in piecing together my bites.  The nice thing is that it was a good size burrito; not some \"as big as your head\" monstrosity.  I was full after the meal so I didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts, but the Kahlua brownie with ice cream sounded delicious.  Maybe next time...",

They also have a very spacious patio that can accommodate A LOT of guests.    I have never been able to try anything other than the tacos.  Their tacos are served in soft tortillas (actually the tortilla is two tortillas held together by a layer of cheese).  The fish tacos are 100% on point!  The carnitas and beef tacos are out of the world as well.  They have a self serve salsa stand that may be the best part of the culinary experience.  Their salsas aren't pure heat but seem to focus on flavor instead.  Aside from the great tacos, Juan Jaime's pours a great drink!  they have a few creative drink recipes I've never seen anywhere else and a gigantic tequila selection.  They also draw a nice crowd and make you feel like a regular from your first visit.",

This place is definitely trying to pull off cool and I think they do a pretty good job of it.  Their expansive selection of Tequila, enhances the mood they set out to create.  I do not like that you had to pay for chips and salsa but the food was pretty cheap for how nice the restaurant was, so I think it evens out.    They might charge for chips because it's the kind of restaurant where you could spend several hours drinking and if people ate chips the whole time that was happening it wouldn't be profitable.  I say this because their alcohol is a good deal.  16 oz. Dos Equis for four bucks on tap and it wasn't happy hour!  This place is a balance of modestly priced mexican, drinking and nice atmosphere.  The food is not amazing but it's good, and with the atmosphere and wanting to eat at 11 at night this restaurant/bar is overall impressive.  (If weren't for the late late night aspect would probably only give it three stars)",

    "text": "I ate here the other night with my boyfriend and a friend. We were planning on visiting anyway, but we got a coupon for a free appetizer and that pretty much cinched it.  We went during happy hour so we all indulged in the $3 margaritas. I got the watermelon (on the rocks), which I loved. My boyfriend got the house maragrita (on the rocks), which he wasn't crazy about it, and my friend got the peach (blended) which really wasn't all that great.  We got the nachos, which were about $7. I was surprised to see that it was just chips and cheese with some salsa and jalapenos on the side. They do have a salsa bar with different kinds of salsa and also lettuce and cabbage, but when I think nachos I also think sour cream and at least some kind of beans or ground beef of it. Not to say it wasn't tasty, just not really what I was expecting.  For dinner I got a combo of a cheese enchilada and a steak taco with rice and beans on the side. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the enchilada, but everything else was tasty.  For dessert we got sopapillas. These were tasty (how can you go wrong with fried dough?), but had a little too much cinnamon (this is coming from a girl who *likes* her cinnamon). They were also served with warm honey, which was good. My friend and boyfriend were only so-so about the sopapillas.  It was a pretty good eat, although I don't know if I'd become a regular.",

Every time I try a new Mexican place I have these grandiose ideas that I'm going to discover some new and exciting taco's that'll blow my little mind and make me feel like I'm eating at a little taco stand in Mexico. Well... as you can probably guess, I'm usually pretty disappointed when that doesn't happen 99 out of 100 times. Well, chalk up another dead soldier in my search for amazing Mexican food in AZ.   Juan Jaime's turned out to be pretty average... decent assortment of various standard Mexican dishes; okay prices, pretty fresh flavor... but no 'wow factor'. With Mexican food, you've gotta do something to separate yourself. I can close my eyes and point to almost any cross street in Arizona and be within walking distance of a dozen Mexican restaurants. So why the hell do so many of them play it so safe? I guess there's nothing wrong with places like this... the food is good enough; I just feel like I could make the same stuff if given the same ingredients at home... I want to be amazed when I go out to eat, not paralyzed by averageness! Maybe the tequila part of the menu is a little more fun, too bad I don't drink.   Who knows if I'll ever go back to Juan Jamie's... probably will just file it under my ever growing list of average Mexican spots I only eat at if I'm desperately craving some south of the border food.

It's pretty close to our house, great happy hour and great service, both times we've been there, our servers were really cool. Oh, and the food is pretty good too, especially for being so inexpensive.   Can't beat $2.50 margaritas, they aren't the biggest margaritas, but...$2.50, I'm not going to complain. I had a steak taco last night, it was pretty dang good, and they have a salsa bar. My fiance loved his burrito.  There is also a nice little patio.",

When we ordered the fish tacos, she suggested adding a great verde sauce- which wasn't on the menu.   I ordered the house margarita on the rocks. They're made from a mix and the first one was tasty and the second one seemed a little heavier on the mix. Happy Hour margaritas were $2.50.",

    "text": "My cousin Bibi and her husband Marcos came to visit this weekend, we hung out, BBQ'ed, played spades, and dominoes, and drank some really fantastic margaritas courtesy of Marcos. YUM!  So Sunday we're all tired from the day before and hungry, so we tried to hit up Sushi Ave, but it was closed!  BOOOO!  So we were like wtf, what now?  We ended up at Juan Jaime's.  We hadn't been there for a long while since moving to Gilbert... what a disapointment!!!  Our server was not very nice to say the least.  Morgan accidentallly spilled her drink while playing with Dom (bloody knuckles, don't ask!).  The server handed her some napkins and left... didn't bother to get anyone to clean the HUGE puddle on the floor!  Then at the end of the meal charged us for the spilled drink!  ugh...  Their margaritas sucked ass... I mean seriously, they were bitter and disgusting, I didnt even drink mine.  Mind you, we did have the best Margaritas ever the night before... but these were just gross!  The food was bland and luke warm... I had the mahi mahi taco, they all had a combo plate and weren't impressed... I just really hate when you think you're gonna take a guest somewhere nice and it turns out to be shitty.  Pisses me off.  I'm never going to Juan Jaime's again.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FTheysuck.com&s=b75be994c2ea2e371c12b001163171d83a3331e378259f6add4d15106d654665\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Theysuck.com</a>",

Their food is super fresh and the 3 servers we have had on the 3 different times we have visited have all been great -- attentive and welcoming.

This is not Taco Bell, it's a sit down restaurant. - I asked for more salsa and the server said to me \"Oh, it's right over there at the salsa bar.\" Apparently I have to get my food myself. Not the best customer service. - The menu is limited. That being said, I did enjoy by pork burrito, which was recommended by my server. - The happy hour specials are pretty good. I enjoyed my strawberry margarita made with a top shelf tequila.  I really want to love Juan Jaime's because the food options directly around Chandler Mall are limited to mostly family chain restaurants. Not sure we will be back.",

I will definitely be coming back. Overall it was a nice place.   _______________________________________________________ This was the first time I had ever been. I found it online and decided to go to happy hour. The atmoshere was lively with a variety of people eating, drinking, and talking. The food was great. I got two tacos (steak and carnitas) which was delicious. The beans and rice are ok, I have had better. You also can't beat the cheap and strong happy hour margaritas. I was feeling good after two. The salsa bar was a nice touch.   Now for what I would suggest. I think its crazy that you have to pay for chips but the salsa bar is free??  Also, please get more waiters. Our waiter has several tables to wait on and it took forever.  Poor guy was running all night. While the table next to us had their own personal waitress.   This is a nice place for happy hour with freinds. Just be prepared for a long dinner waiting on the server.",

Someone kindly asked us if we would like to sit there and said they'd be back to clean it. 20 minutes later we finally were able to sit down. 25 more until we could order. It was over an hour before we saw food. It was not busy but only two waitresses appeared to be working. Dirty tables throughout and two areas with spilled food left on the ground (one was half a plate of food the other salsa). I understand restaurants have bad nights  but not one word to acknowledge the wait, I felt unwelcome. The soup was delicious and the tacos were below average. Seems like management was nonexistent.",

Everything went smoothly and the service was mostly good.   Nachos, Street Tacos, we all served hot and hit the spot. The tab? Who knows. LOL. We were mostly a long neck group and they kept coming. They have all the usual beers on tap or in a bottle (photo). Nice.  We normally come here mostly for their Taco Tuesday's, but the service and the bartenders are top notch and friendly. I particularly like their Salsa bar, with limes, radishes, jalapenos peppers, and four or five different salsas.   It's so good here, you'll come for lunch, and stay for dinner. LOL. It's the Hotel California Of Mexican restaurants.   Enjoy!",

They have an excellent happy hour for drinks $2.50 margs, $4 Tres Olives and $1 off beer and wine. The food is pretty basic (and honestly priced a tad high for what it is). They have fish, shrimp, steak, pork and veggies. You can have these served up in a taco, burrito or salad. Like I said pretty basic. What really sets this place apart is the owner and the service. Every time I come in he is super friendly and always asks us to try new things he is thinking of adding to the menu. One time it was a spicy jalapeno corn, and last time it was a honey chipotle vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was awesome and he even gave me the recipe (no I will not share it).  If you're in Chandler and looking for a cheap happy hour in decent environment give Juan's a try. You'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "Phenom.  The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila.  Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice.  It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be.  The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made.  I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish.  Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure.  Service is friendly and quick.  I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale.  Good food. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Stopped in here with the hubby after shopping at the mall all afternoon. We were both hungry but just wanted a quick bite and didn't want to deal with the mediocre chains around Chandler mall that are always so packed on weekend evenings. Didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had Happy Hour going on, even though it was the weekend.   We ordered the trio of dips to start. The queso and salsa were both good though too thin IMHO. The guacamole was nice and thick - I am not a fan of the stuff but my husband said it was like pure avocado with just seasonings added (which he liked). Then he ordered some tortilla soup and I got a shrimp tostada then we also shared a combo plate. Overall, I would say this is really not authentic Mexican food at all but still pretty tasty.   I would have just given it three stars but I added one more because they have my all-time favorite drink, the Michelada. For those of you who don't know what that is, it is a beer mixed with tomato juice or clamato and you add lime juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire, and other misc spices. I make mine at home with Corona Light and Mister T's Bloody Mary mix. Of course it is better when done by a professional, but at most places when I ask for it they don't know what it is, even at Mexican restaurants. Then when I explain it they stare at me like I'm crazy. It may sound weird if you've never had one but is is the most delicious, refreshing drink ever. They made it perfectly at Juan Jaime's and served it in a chilled glass with sweet chilli powder on the rim. It was great! I will come back to this place again just for that drink. I was also very impressed with the tequila menu, it took up the whole page!   Overall, the food at this place is similar to Rubios or Chipotle but the atmosphere is way cooler. There were no kids running around, and it had a great bar. It seems like the perfect happy hour place. I really liked the patio but I just wish it didn't face the street. The location in Scottsdale looks like it is bigger and not in a strip mall. But in Chandler we have to take what we can get I guess.",

Didn't drink on this occasion but definitely looks like a great place for happy hour .. $2.50 domestic drafts, $3.00 margaritas.  The server even brought my mom a margarita with a candle lit in the middle of it! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a great taco and happy hour!!!",

They were each ok but somehwat bland for my taste, leaning on the less authentic, more americanized side of the taco spectrum. The salsas were adequate but nothing truly stood out flavor-wise. Overall, an ok option if its late at night and nothing else is available.",

They have a great selection of authentic Mexican food, and they also have a very great Tequila bar.   If you are planning on drinking, make sure that you go for their Happy Hour. They have some great drink specials.   What's nice about this place is that the charge for the food is based off of what you get, not the meat. You can get a burrito with Grilled Mahi Mahi, and it is the same price as their Grilled Steak. Very tasty.   Also, make sure that you get some Chips and Salsa. They have a great salsa bar with very fresh salsas and toppings. Their chips are cooked right there, and they have that great thin and crisp texture that makes eating them quite addicting.   If you're looking for some great Mexican food right around the corner from the Chandler Fashion Center, look no further. This is the place to be!",

At first glance it seems okay and I like that they have a salsa bar but that's where it ends.  Being someone that doesnt eat meat I was basically left with cheese enchiladas or the vegetarian burrito, so not feeling like eating a half pound of cheese I ordered the burrito.  After waititng about 15 minutes the waitress and some guy from the kitchen come back to inform me that the rice in the burrito is cooked in a chicken stock so they wanted to know if it should be included.  Okay, so thanks for letting me know that I guess, but now my burrito is going to consist of some black beans and bell peppers...Here's an idea, dont call it a vegetarian burrito if one of the main ingredients in it is cooked in chicken juice!  Or you could simply have some non-chicken stock rice on hand for this exact situation...just sayin'.  On top of that they gave my co-worker black beans when she ordered refried and it seriously took 35 minutes for them to whip up and a burrito and an enchilada.  We alsomost had to just get it to go.....needless to say I will be exploring other lunch options in the area.",

If you are staying at a hotel any where near Chandler Fashion Square, this is one Uber ride that would be well worth it!",

I didn't know what to expect aside from a hole-in-the-wall bar place lol. Literally wasn't that at all.  I realized that its right smack down in the middle of Chandler. Its in a perfect little hidden location next to a bunch of good restaurants. Service was great. The place wasn't packed at all, which was a huge plus. It was laid back.  Our server (both times) was very nice. He and she came back to the table several times every 10 minutes it seemed to make sure we were good. Margaritas were 10/10. They were good, and they actually use tequila in them here. By the way its literally $4 margaritas on happy hour, which is 4pm-8pm daily I believe. I think they are $5 off of happy hour, but they are delicious and are the main reason why I'm coming back.  It wasn't until the 2nd visit that I realized the tacos were amazing. They had alot of different meat choices, but I opted in for steak. It was delicious and filling! The tacos were good, and were not just little street tacos. The trio is the way to go if you are hungry FYI.  Restaurant cleanliness 5/5 Service 5/5 Price 5/5 Value 5/5  I don't leave many 5 star reviews, but I intend to keep it this way with many more visits. LIterally my new favorite place to go now.",

Seriously was a nice surprise with a flavorful salsa bar and freshly made tacos and tostadas. Sat at the bar and was greeted immediately and served drinks and lunch promptly. Server behind bar was friendly and not overly bothersome like some places. Nice atmosphere. Will be back for sure. Just wish we'd stopped in years ago when we first noticed the place from driving down the street. Also wish it was closer to our home but we will make the trip to come again. The bill was extremely reasonable too! Oh yeah.....the food was BOMB!",

I thought that was kind of impressive he would actually care that much. He was nice and I had kind of forgotten about it.  Well it was a really pretty day in AZ and I happened to be in the neighborhood so I decided to give it another try. Maybe it could have been an isolated incident and I don't like to be an evil yelper. I choose to sit outside since it was so nice and I was immediately helped and got a drink fast ( good start ).  Ordered the veggie tacos which came out promptly.  This was about the same time I ate here last time just for reference. Taylor my waiter informed me there is a salsa bar so I headed inside to grab some salsa verde.  The tacos were quite good as well as the rice and salsa verde. I'm not usually a fan of black beans, but they really were nice. I would give it 3.5 stars for food, but maybe since I am in a good mood today and Taylor was a very cheerful and excellent waiter I am going with 4.  I'll be back, but so far seems like I just hit them on a bad day last time.",

That would be a pretty good guess!  My daughter and I were running errands all day and saw this place on our way home and decided to stop.  We ordered a couple sodas, some chips and salsa, which by the way they charge you for, even though they serve chips with your entree and have an open salsa bar??? Salsa was OK but the chips were stale and had been sitting in their own grease too long.  I got the 2 tacos, one carnitas and one mahi mahi.(see pics) Greasy and Bland with Mushy Meat and just plain not good! Although I could see where someone full of tequila might think these were the best things they ever tasted, if that even counts, I Think not!  My daughter ordered the small burrito, which we thought was just a smaller version of the regular burrito. She asked for just beans and steak inside.  Well no need to waste a flash on that one, it arrived just as plain and boring as the tacos and if there was ANY steak in that burrito it must have been pre-chewed.....cause I've never seen any steak like that before and been charged and extra $2.50 for it,  where's the Beef Juan?  What a Total waste of money!  I agree with Eugene.T  I No Likey!!!",

They offer, burritos & salads with a good selection of fillings.    My taco had the grilled mahi mahi which was excellent but a wee bit dry.  There Salsa Bar is unique and I used their pico de gallo and other salsas to spice up my tacos.  The unique feature of the mahi mahi that I liked is that it is not breaded.  If you have been to Rubio's for their good fish tacos, sometimes you get more breading than actual fish.  My partner had the chicken salad & enjoyed having the toppings grouped together on top and having the cilantro dressing separate.  Our server, Sara, was great.  As the saying goes, she was \"attentive without being intrusive\".     We noticed families with kids of all ages.  There best parking is reserved for take out.  Another great Mexican food place is Garcia's although J J is by far better on the pocketbook.",

Dos Gringos has nothing on this place, I HATE DOS GRINGOS, it's sloppy, sticky, disgusting, and the food is garbage, not to mention the awful staff. Juan Jaime's has good food, it's simple but good. The staff at Juan's is also nice and accommodating, they know their people and take care of them the right way.  Juan Jaime's is a big win in my book for offering whole wheat tortillas...nobody else does I swear. They make a good burrito, they make good tacos, it's a good bite every time, I never have a bad experience eating here, and I don't get bored of it either!

We asked him about it and he rudely said that he didn't know and would have to ask him as he point to a back wall. He then rudely asked \"Are you guys going to order tequila or not?\" not even a second after he said the previous statement. We tried to say we need to know if there was any cross contamination before we even attempted to get anything which he then said \"If you might be allergic to the chips then don't eat them!\" when it wasn't just the chips we were talking about. We walked out as a patron there said \"Tony! Are you okay? Are you as drunk as me?\". I wouldn't suggest going to this place. Very rude service and Tony is a drunken mess.",

They have a great outdoor patio area that is nice when the weather is cooler (although I think the furniture out there could be upgraded a bit).

Tony, the bartender is terrific.  Excellent margarita, excellent service.  I really liked the salsa, good flavor and not too spicy, and then there is a salsa bar, my husband picked a hot salsa off the bar and he really liked that.  I had a combo, cheese enchilada and steak taco with rice and beans.  Defiantly having that taco again, delish.  Enchilada was different than I am use to but the flavor was good.  Absolutely loved the re-fried beans. Not usually a fan.  Most of the time they are thick and dry but these were creamy and delish.  Having those again also.  We have been to several Mex .rest. and so far this is the one we have agreed we will return to.   Although I will add, I did not like the guacamole.  Not the best",

    "text": "I have never given a restaurant a 1 star rating. But for the life of me, I couldn't understand how this establishment was receiving 4 stars with 129 reviews. I mean, the ratings were the only reason I decided to give it a go after all!   Carrying on, if there's one thing that gets to me, it's really bad Mexican food. Now, I understand this place in no way advertised that it was down-home cooking, or anywhere near authentic Mexican cuisine, but for what it advertised on its menu (enchiladas, tacos, tostadas, burritos and the like), I expected at least a Tex-Mex kinda meal.   Boy was I wrong. It was just horrible. They had removed every aspect of what makes Mexican food Mexican food, and replaced it with what tasted like something you got at a gas station in the middle of no where. The \"creamy green\" sauce they serve on their burritos and enchiladas (not sure if they serve it on anything else) was hard to swallow with a straight face. It tasted like Campbell's canned cream of mushroom soup. Their beans and rice, SO incredibly tasteless and somewhat undercooked. And their house salsa I'm pretty dern sure was that disgusting Pace Picante tomato paste you get out of a jar sold at your local supermarket.   I wondered if the waitress knew how horrible the food was...I felt badly lying to her and saying everything was okay when she came around to check on us. Because it most definitely was NOT. But complaining to her about it was not going to fix the bigger problem at hand, which was the food there is simply atrocious.   Moving forward, I will be a bit more hesitant relying on reviews when picking new places to dine at. I have a feeling this place's 5 star ratings aren't all that genuine... Be weary fellow my fellow Yelpers. Be weary.",

My husband and I are new to the area and brought my mother here when she was visiting and we love the Tex-mex food.. so much we came here twice in three days. My mother and husband ordered the burrito enchilada style, they said it was very very good. Red sauce is a little spicy but the green was delicious! I ordered two hard shell tacos and they were so so great! The shells were fresh as well as the chips, for sure made in house. Highly recommend this place and happy hour drinks are awesome! Even not during happy hour prices are very reasonable. Great service as well, we will be visiting here frequently!! :)",

Tacos are great! Didn't like the creamy green sauce and the tostada was good. Wish they had the cabbage with lime juice, they only had plain shredded cabbage. All in all, stop in for a taco and great tequila.",

    "text": "So we came to this place and it's actually really good. Their salsa bar here is small but has amazing tasting salsa. We ordered the nacho Grande with no jalapenos and simple delicious. Very basic like most nachos but yet it wasn't. The for my dinner I got the tres taco plate with the fillers of grilled shrimp, grilled steak, and mahi mahi with refried beans and rice. Each taco by themselves were simple tasteful. But when you add the lime that they offer. It releases this excellent flavor for each one and made them taste better even though they were great in the beginning. The atmosphere is perfect, amazing music that plays and just awesome. We'll probably come here for more food and some possibly drinks :)",
