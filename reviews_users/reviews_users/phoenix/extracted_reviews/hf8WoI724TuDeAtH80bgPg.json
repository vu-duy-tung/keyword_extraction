It was 15 minutes before a waitress even acknowledged us. We tried to order a long island and a crown and coke. Our waitress told us that the bar would only make the drinks on their list of cocktails. Really? Umm no. We then just ordered a beer each and jager bomb....25 minutes later, she still hadn't brought our drinks. We asked her to scratch the beers and just bring the jager. Literally seconds before walking out, she brought \"jager bombs\" and both of our beers. Beers were both wrong and jager bombs weren't jager bombs...we don't know wth they were. We paid the full ticket with out drinking our incorrect drinks and went to San Tan instead, where they served us a long island and a crown and coke and amazing food (As always). Sorry but never again.",

I liked this place a lot better when it was an Uncle Bears. Lately I've been craving a good black and tan drink, for some reason no body at this location can make one. Alright I get it your bartenders are not that experienced, I will give you the benefit of the doubt, but don't come up to me and hand me a dark beer with no tan with a smirk saying \"better luck next time this will have to do\". At least have the kindness to say \"hey we cannot do that would you like something else\" Now I still payed for the drink and drank it, but sadly it's not what I wanted. I mean don't tell me \"okay black and tan coming right up\" and bring me something other than a black and tan.         That's not the only reason why I'm upset about this place, my wife and I came here on St. Paddy's day about an hour before close (10pm is when they close), we got seated immediately, awesome right. My wife ordered the Rib dip with Coleslaw, we did not get that order, and she ordered a Margarita......never showed up. We left with neither of our desires. We payed we left, we've been to this location countless number of times and never has been as good as uncle bears or nearly close. Food wise and beer wise their good, don't expect much more.",

For a hamburger, I chose something I was familiar with, the Juicy Lucy invented in Minneapolis. They had a variation of it that was hot with buffalo sauce called a Juicy Luci'fer. If you like hot, try it. I cut mine in quarters so no sauce spilled out. I was completely pleased with the experience. It's hard to get into sometimes. I went for lunch and sat on the patio.",

A $15.50 burger and the fries are extra? I ordered it it medium-well as they said it would have a bit of pink in the middle. When I got it, it was cold and raw in the middle. Along with about maybe 10 to 12 fries. It took about three or four minutes to get someone's attention so I could get the waitress to come back -- it was not a busy night - she apologized and took it back and brought out another. The new burger had another order of fries with it. When I got the bill, I was charged for two orders of fries and my waitress said that I got the second order by mistake, but wouldn't take it off the bill. I asked to see a mgr. and was told he was not available at the moment.  Bad service, bad business, and I'll never go to any of these places again.",

By 12:29, someone finally came to us and said that last call for food was at 12:30. Then the bartender yells \"last call.\"  My gripe is that after I was told on the phone that kitchen closed at 12:45 & we would get served if we got there before then. We were ignored until 12:30 in a very slow place. The server offered to ask her manager if they can serve us. Too late! I want to give this place a chance but they didn't give us a chance.",

We sat down but then waited for about 10 minutes before our server came to greet us.  We placed our drink orders and food orders right away.  This was at about 6:40.  At 7:10 we were still waiting for our food (not a complicated order- just a burger and a hot dog).  The server finally came up to apologize for the wait and promised us it was coming right up.  We finally were served about 5 minutes later.  The food was decent.  The onion rings were just the way I like them except they weren't hot..but not totally cold so I let it go.  The burger and the hot dog were good...typical bar fare.. nothing spectacular but ok.  At that point we were then approached several times by some guys who were probably management apologizing for the wait and asking if we needed anything.  The server also came over to tell us they were going to take $5 off our bill since we waited for so long.  I thought that was nice.  Overall, it wasn't a great dining experience but I think under different circumstances it would be better.  The football game had just come on and I think they got slammed.  The prices were ok...maybe a little bit more than I would have thought is reasonable.. I will most likely return but probably not during such a busy time of day.",

Only downfall is this place is a tad bit pricey for what you get. But overall a pretty solid spot for happy hour and lunch.",

The smores kit didn't even come out to make an even amount of smores. I believe it said it served 4, however there were not enough graham crackers to have a complete smore and there  was just a random amount of chocolate and marshmallows. I would expect 8 crackers, 4 marshmallows, 4 chocolates, I mean those aren't high quantities to count to, so should be pretty simple.  We also waited long amounts of time before a server would come to our table, therefore drink refills were few and far between.  The food was excellent!

My husband's said his was okay, but he was expecting more.  I ordered the Hawaiian  burger. I was dreaming of the same burger I had in Hawaii. Dream no, more of a nightmare .

Now the not so good: we waited quite some time for our drink order to arrive, the waitress was super nice but just took a long time. After she brought our food she let us know one item was going to come out separately because it wasn't ready quite yet (nbd). 20 min later the other part of the order came out. The waitress said she would take it off the price of the meal since it took so long (thank you for that!) when she brought the bill out she had removed that charge but then I noticed a $2 \"SPLIT CHARGE\". I asked her what that was for and she said the manager requires them to bill that whenever the customer requests a burger be cut in half (to share or even just to eat a little easier). That is honestly so insane to me. The burger was $10!! That is 1/5 if the price of the burger haha.  Even though the food was good, we unfortunately will pick a different local spot to eat at.",

    "text": "Horrible. We used to love coming here, and every time I go with my mom the service and everything is great! Now I'm not one to complain about service or anything, And I barely ever leave something as bad as a yelp review, However, I've been here twice with my roommates (we're all 20-21 and three of us are servers) and both times we have had absolutely horrible service. It's hard for me to say that because I am a server so I understand how hard it can be, but both times we have gone it has been completely slow. The first time our server never came back until she started pushing us to pay, and the second was even worse. First our server, Carley, took a while to bring us menus and greet us, which is no big deal, but once our order was placed she completely disappeared. One of us wanted to order a drink but Carley never came back. We ended up having to wait until our food came out and asked the runner for it, and she said she would get our server. She still never came until the manager came to ask us how our food was, and we asked him to order the drink. Right after, she came and asked what we wanted. My boyfriends burger was way overcooked (he asked for rare and it was well done) and he barely touched it. The drink took forever to come out and by the time it did we were all done with our meal. And, to top it, she ended up adding auto-gratuity to a party of 6. I have never EVER heard of this happening before in my years as a server and consumer, it has always been a bill over $200 or a party of 8 or more. I've also never been auto grated for any size party at that location, so it was very strange. We love this burger joint and it's unfortunate that this is the closest to our home. We won't be returning to this location.",

However I am doing the low-carb thing and my burger came out with nothing inside of it I had ordered the stuffed Burger the juicy Lucy. So I'm just disappointed and I tell my waitress So she. Says no problem and I'll get you a new one it's not supposed to be like that. It took another 30 minutes for that burger to come back out. My entire party was finish eating, so I didn't really even want it at that point. My waitress took offense to this and she reluctantly removed it from my bill. Now mind you have the service been good the whole time, I probably wouldn't have complained at all, but it was slow all afternoon everyone was complaining....so three stars for the four people at our table that we really like their food. -2 for the slow service and the unstuffed Burchet :(",

It was really thick and dry which made scooping it up on the veggies and pita extremely difficult.  Not very flavorful either, but I guess hummus isn't what they're trying to win over customers with.  The other two times I got the veggie burger which was really, really good!  It's made in house, which automatically makes it better then any frozen burger out there.  It has a sweet soy glaze on it too which tastes amazing.  It held together pretty well also.  I do think this place is overpriced....particularly because of the $2 upcharge for fries instead of chips.  Really?  When you're paying $11-$18 for a burger or sandwich, lets throw in the fries people.  And their water tastes like dirt which I always forget and then they bring out this monster sized cup of it, which after one sip I can't drink and then feel bad about wasting it.",

Great music was playing and the crowd was a good one.

It was very busy because the ASU game was just about to start but the service was still amazing! My husband and I just got done eating lunch at a nearby restaurant but left because the service was so poor. We are so sad we didn't visit this place first!   Right as we sat down we were greeted quickly and waited on consistently! We only had one beer each because we were so full from lunch but the bartenders were so kind and attentive. The food looked amazing, great beer selection and as busy as it was the service was still incredible and that's why I'm rating this place so high! I only got one drink here but I can't wait to come back and visit again!",

The ordering process is very easy, they have this sheets you can fill out to make your own burger. We filled them out and then they came to take our order sheets. It took a while to get the food, but I assume that is because the food is made to order. My friend's burger was right, while mine was the completely wrong. I was missing 2of the 3 toppings I requested and my meat was medium not medium well. Had way too much pink. Needless to say I sent my burger out.  The manager came out to defend that the burger wasn't completely wrong, it was just missing 2 items and was medium. Hmmm okay.  By the time the right burger came out my friend was done with his dinner and I was full from the sides I ate. So I sent the second one back also.   The manager made no attempt to make it right. In fact he tried to defend giving me a $10 discount when the burger was $12. It took 3 trips to our table to explain simple math to him.   I wish o could comment on how the burger taste, but I can't. I know the service is terrible and I will not be back.",

We went a couple weeks ago for happy hour and I had to write a review because I've had nothing but good experiences here!  The staff is always super great and we've never had any issues with service. The restaurant itself has a fun atmosphere and a nice big patio for days when it's nice out. We've also been able to watch several baseball and football games there, they have plenty of tvs and usually have several different games going.   True to their name, amazing cheeseburgers and always a huge craft beer selection. Their happy hour deals are awesome, and they usually have additional drink specials going on (when we went a couple of weeks ago on a Thursday they had $4 select Four Peak brews).   Like I said, I've never had anything but good experiences here! My fiance and I will continue to frequent this location and will continue to recommend it to everyone!",

They have a lot of TVs so it was great to go watch the game there. The place was packed! The service was a bit slow but it was busy so I understand. My friends and I ordered a few things. The buffalo chicken tots were awesome (craving them as I write this)! They were flavorful, right amount of greasy without feeling gross and a great spicy kick! The turkey burger were just eh. I mean the bun tastes nice and soft. Also had the basic mac n cheese with chicken. It tasted basic but I liked that again the food didn't taste heavy and it was still pretty good. We shared the smores. Menu shows serves 4. We each had about one smore each. There were more graham crackers and chocolate than marshmallows.   Overall, I would like to go back and try out some more food and give you another update! (Oh and get some more buffalo chicken tots!).",

No silverware, no plates, no napkins, nothing. We asked for water about 4 times before we got it and my husband then after we waited for 15 minutes after eating went and got the check... Which had a THIRTY PERCENT GRATUITY. I was in food service for many years so I get charging gratuity but 30% for horrendous service is absolutely unacceptable. First and last time at this place for sure. Oh and obviously I'm not going to give a business 1 star just for service. The menu was pretty expensive for cheeseburgers which were solved cold and were quite lackluster. The bathroom was dirty and we had to drive around for 10 minutes just for a parking spot on the other side of the strip mall.",

We had called the manager over, instead of apologizing for the delay, he told us that we should understand that they're packed up and have two large groups. We were told like small kids to understand and not treated like paying customers.  Given that we had provided sufficient notice that we were coming the day before, they should have been prepared.  Most of the food was cold and not cooked the way we had wanted it. Most of our food came out medium rare. They took the one burger off the check, but because we were hungry, most of the folks ended up eating just half of our food.  We are utterly disappointed and will never return.",

The burger took a while and I imagine it's because I ordered everything including the kitchen sink on my burger:  i.e. 1/2 lb angus beef with sauteed onions, peppers, mushrooms; pickles, lettuce, jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, bacon, pineapple, fried egg, cheeses: cheddar, provolone, jack, Gruyere, and Swiss; bbq sauce on an artisan bun. My wife played it smart and ordered a few items on her burger. She subbed in fries instead of homemade chips for a couple of $$.  Overall, the meal was rather ordinary, my burger as well. I would rate it 2.5 out of 5 stars. My wife's burger bun ripped at first bite and the tangy chipotle sauce was more like bbq sauce. It seems like a glorified sports bar that charges more $$$ for their food.  Fortunately, I already have one of those that I like.   Tip:  Wednesday's are Create your own burger night with any/all toppings for $12.",

At least its homemade and not something you could buy in the grocery store. The salads have very fresh ingredients and i would highly recommend  The biggest issue is the lack of proper staffing. The vast majority of the waitresses are positive and helpful but they are typically stretched too thin.   I would also recommend changes to the appetizer menu.

That wasn't the case sadly, and we weren't informed so until we'd been sat and ordered a beer. Kind of disappointing that the channel didn't have it live, but we carried on. Even before finding out the game wasn't carried live, the staff changed 2 TV's for us. Their beer list absolutely rocks! The place has a great variety of local & regional brews, and the standard fares [Bud, PBR, Michelob, etc]. The drink list looks pretty fab too - next time might have to try one of their beer & shot combos, hah. The food menu is fairly simple and straightforward American fare. All of us went with burgers and fries. The fries had too much salt & seasoning which I had to wipe off in order to enjoy. My fried egg/bacon burger was great, but also a little to salty, unfortunately not something I was able to wipe away. Next time I'll definitely try something else on the menu and another local beer.

    "text": "I've passed this place a couple times as I eat at the pizza place across the way so I finally decided to give it a try. They have an assortment of Burgers, Dogs, Salads, and Sandwiches. I had a cheeseburger and it was phenomenal. The meat was juicy and all the veggies were fresh. The bun was warm and super soft. They serve it with a knife stuck in the top so you can immediacy cut into it and see the nice pink center ( I like mine med well ). You can get it with chips or fries. I got it with fries and this is the reason I only give it 4 stars. All of the pictures I saw on yelp show crinkle cut fries but I got regular plan non crinkle cut fries. I'm a sucker for crinkle cut so this really disappoint me. The fries they have now aren't good. BRING BACK THE CRINKLE CUT PLEASE .  As for the service, waitresses were great and super accommodating. It was hard to find them at times but they were very social able. I could tell there were a lot of regulars as I overheard the conversations with others customers around me. The manger was always walking the floor to make sure there was no shenanigans going on. Lots of TVs and great music playing. Will definitely be coming back to try other things on the menu.",

My only beef (sorry) with this place is the price, it's a little steep for a burger...but then again most places these days overcharge. 13 bucks for a burger is nuts. For two people to eat with tip and tax it's like 40-50 bucks. You can decide if that price is worth it for fast casual burger joint food.  I like how the servers and staff are not forced to wear flair and corporate junk, they have tats and colored hair, and I like that! It's definitely not a corporate boring chain, they have a small business kind of atmosphere, but corporate prices...that's life.  Decent place to get a burger and a drink, just know it's not gonna be super cheap. Overall an okay option.",

Location is good and the set up for sports is amazing - TVs visible from everywhere. The only drink special was Mimosas (first one for $10, each refill for $1), which was disappointing given their extensive draft beer collection. Service was slow, but decent. Prices were higher than I thought they'd be, especially for what you get (both the burger and the portion). Shared some totchos, had a burger, had a beer. Simple as that.

Just wanted to try your cheeseburgers. They reluctantly seated us. Our server was very awesome though. Very friendly and patient. We had a lot of questions about the menu. Rather pricey for a lunch time cheeseburger. But, if it was good, it would be worth it. If....  Waitress comes and gets our drinks. We both order iced tea. Simple enough. But it was BAD. Like have not changed the filter since they opened hard chemical taste bad. Changed up to diet sodas. Then we both ordered extremely weird orders. Replace this with that. Put that on the side. Add extra this. Our server was on it. She got it all and was very happy to see we got what we requested. So far so semi-good (other than the greeting & tea).  Food comes out. Its this young kid from the kitchen. He comes out going to all the tables with younger and pretty girls sitting at them asking them if this is their order. Skips every table with a large person, all guys or older people sitting there. So we tried to get his attention but he was totally concentrating on something else entirely. So we watch as our food is walking around with this kid getting nice and cold. He goes back to the kitchen with it. Shortly after our waitress comes out with it. Colder than I like it.  I replaced my order's fries with coleslaw. Big mistake. One, the slaw was a $2 up-charge. And two, it had the nastiest seasonings in it. It was uneatable. How can you ruin cole slaw?! My burger was ok. The burger itself, the meat part, perfection. Perfectly cooked and amazing flavor and juiciness. Cool. Everything else. Slop. I wanted the blue cheese burger, It had maybe 5 crumbs of blue cheese. So the you could not taste it. No avocado at all and very sparing on the rest of the toppers. A little birdie kept flying over the kitchen yelling \"cheep cheep cheep\"! They snubbed me on a great burger experience so they could make as much money on me as possible.  To summarize. Bad welcome. Awesome server. Bad rest of staff. Bad tea. Ok burger. EXTREMELY overpriced. Over $20 for my hamburger that was supposed to be a cheeseburger, disgusting coleslaw and crap drinks. Felt like I was screwed to the highest with this lunch.  Then as we left (out the FRONT door) one of the staff had a pile of trash that he ran into us with and spilled boxes on the floor. He got mad and started kicking them out the door. We tried being nice and help the door open for him, but he was mad. I thought trash is supposed to go out the back somewhere. Not the front where people are literally being kicked out with it.  Never returning. Ever.",

    "text": "Having been to the one in Scottsdale and waited 30 minutes for a burger, I warned my friends that this place may take a while. I had even less hope while trying to get a parking space for lunch (I ended up parking behind the Karate place). Pro tip: Make your own parking spot along the little road that goes through the shopping center, if you know how to parallel park.  Coming in sweaty and last among my group, I was led outside to the back patio.   Woot. More sweat.  But it actually wasn't bad. The misters did their job in the shade, and we were all quite comfortable. The service was 10 times better than the Scottsdale location. When I couldn't decide between fries and sweet tots, I ordered the fries, but they brought me out a tiny thing of sweet tots to try. They were, of course, delicious (I mean, they are sweet potato tots). So I got an order of them as well, adding on to the Open Pit Burger and fries (I shared).  The place is a bit spendy, with no real lunch menu to speak of. It was about 20 bucks with tip, more than I usually spend for lunch (but that did include the tots). The burgers are large, but the flavor is average. Nothing really pops.  But they know what to do with a potato, and their beer selection is on point (I was there for work, but I perused). That, coupled with great service, made this a pretty good experience. I'll probably go back. On payday.",

We took her suggestion and ordered those and one other appetizer.   We then put in our order for food.   Appetizers never came.   Then the food came out...well...3 of the 4 meals came out.  Haha. The 4th was a few minutes later which was super awkward for the 3 of us who got our food.   Mine was a burger and the burger was good...cooked as ordered, etc... but I ordered sweet potato tots and got regular. When the 4th meal finally came out, we asked about the tots. They brought a bowl of sweet potato tots out. Thank goodness they left me the regular ones because the sweet ones were cold, soggy, and pretty gross.   The server never noticed that she didn't bring our appetizers. Of course, she didn't come back very often, so maybe that was why. Luckily they weren't on the bill, so we didn't have to argue about that. It took long enough to get the check and get it back that any additional delay would have been torture.    OH! And the parking was AWFUL. It was Wednesday so I can't even IMAGINE what it must be like on a weekend! We had to drive around the entire shopping center three times and finally ended up parking at another restaurant (BLD) and walk through some kind of smelly drainage area to get to the restaurant.   In the end, even though this place was close to my house, I don't think I'll go back unless someone else reeeeeeally wants to go.",

The reason for 2 stars is for the service, while our waitress was great, the other waitress who brought our food out- literally dropped off our food in a hurry and immediately turned around to chat and dance for a group of guys at the table next to us. The plate she dropped off was on the edge of our table, she didn't tell us it was  his hand. The food somewhat made up for the service.  We won't write this place off, I'll try it again and update the post if it's better.",

The hello was good, but the time estimate was deterring. \"It could take anywhere from 20-40 minutes or maybe more for a table to open up based on when people leave from the first game.\" It doesn't encourage a person to stay. Sounds like seating is possible, but not guaranteed. We didn't wait. Went to one of the other delicious restaurants in the parking lot that was able to give us a wait time, and seated is within that time.  A little more training might be needed for the hostess desk. Uncertainty is not the signal you want to send at the entry.",

Never had a problem sitting at the bar as the bartenders seem to have the most energy and best attitude. They engage their customers.  Food is good and prices are fair. Like the atmosphere.  *Update.... 34 televisions and only one set for Dolphin's game. It was on a screen partially hidden behind a wall at the bar. I was the only person sitting at the bar and asked if I could have the game moved to a television directly in front of me. It took an act of congress and threat to leave to effect change. Sadly, customer service has depreciated over time.",

They currently have Alpine Duet on tap, which is one of my favorite IPAs in the world. We normally come here for Mmmac Daddy Mondays - unlimited toppings for $12, such a smokin deal! The portion sizes are gigantic; I usually need up taking more than half my bowl home and making two more meals out of it. The burgers are consistently delicious, and they actually cook your patty to your desired temperature.   Probably the most life changing thing that I've only discovered at CBCB... Totchos. Yep, tots + nachos. Mind BLOWN. If you have a cheat day coming up and you're looking for some artery clogging goodness, this is your winner right here. The original totchos with chili, cheese, sour cream, and guac is amazing; as is the buffalo chicken variety. The serving size can easily feed 2-3 people, though you might not want to share!  This is a great place to watch sports, as there are massive TVs on every wall so you always have a good view of the game you're looking for. The service here is pretty hit or miss, though Sierra was our server this time and she was excellent!",

It lets you know it's hot while also allowing the other flavors of the burger to come through. Also had the \"tot-chos\" I think they were called? Tater tots, meat, cheese, guacamole and sour cream. These were pretty good as the tots retained their crispness without turning into a pile of mush. Staff is attentive and knowledgeable. Ambiance and decor is sports bar/quality family dining environment. Check out the PB&J burger if you can get over your thought that PB doesn't belong on a burger. It does!",

Although there were many associates around, especially the girls at the hostess table, don't ask them for help. They acted as it was an inconvenience to try to find out waitress as she took all orders but one.   After ordering we did not see out waitress for a long time. We had to ask for our check and that again took time.   To spend over $100 on beer and burgers. Not a fan and won't be rushing back.",

I got shredded lettuce for my hamburger and I wished I had a leaf lettuce. I ordered everything on the side with my hamburger including the meat patty off to the side so that I could degrease it with a napkin. I wished I would have had white onions instead they only have red onions. I got Thousand Island on the side but not quite enough. The sliders three of them were thinly sliced what we thought was supposed to be prime rib but it was very much overdone not very tasty, salty and  regretful. The fries were great they were crunchy very tasty.  The onion rings were salty ok not great. The service was fantastic the waitress was wonderful the beer was cold and tasty we got everything on time. Thank them for their service. I just probably wouldn't eat there again.",

This creates limited parking for the patrons. It was funny seeing two dudes waiting for their car while valet ran 15 feet to get the vehicle! Well I digress. Upon entering, we were pleasantly greeted and seated. First thing I noticed was the awesome wrap around the bar of huge TVs! A TV mecca for any sports fan! We ordered a large beer which came in a small mug (not a pint). The draft and bottled beer menu was extensive!  I ordered the ring of fire burger, which was awesome and spicy but not worth $12. It did include fries or chips. My wife ordered the all American burger which she liked. The onion rings were awesome. The service was great as well. I would return to eat and drink, and recommend his restaurant to others!",

They recently got a new manager, Dustin. Dustin was extremely unprofessional. First, after sitting at the table for 10 minutes we finally asked for a server. Kylie came over, she was the most amazing server and always is awesome to us. We order the buffalo chicken dip, which came out like soup, not dip. We never got silverware.. then our food  came out, Mac and cheese was cold, fries were soggy and cold, and one person at my table didn't get his food until 15 minutes later. When the MANAGER DUSTIN, brought out the dinner he said all the Mac and cheese is pre-portioned as I received a kids size Mac and cheese. He knew the fries and food were cold and didn't do anything. He walked away from the problem and left the problem on our server. At this point it was his problem as a manager to deal with it. After asking 2 DIFFERENT servers for him to come out, he finally came out 25 minutes later with \"hot fries\" and everyone was done with their food. He said he'll take the 3$ fries off and the chicken dip.   Our server was great to us and always is. I love Kylie and will only come back for her.   She brought our check out and it was 44$, we explained to her again what transpired and she said she'll talk to him. He never once came out and apologized, he left it all for Kylie to deal with. He never even mentioned he was a manager when he brought our food out. Poor management and the owners and general manager who are awesome should be embarrassed they hired a \"manager\" like this.  BUT KYLIE IS AMAZING!",

    "text": "Despite living within walking distance and enjoying the food, nearly every time we have chosen to eat here it has been met with disappointment. We chose tonight because it was close and while it is during the D-Backs' playoff game, the service left loads to be desired.  We waited a good 10 minutes before the waitress came to our table to get our drink order. It took at least another 10 minutes just to get an iced tea and a glass of water. Had we been drinking beers or cocktails, perhaps the service would have been more promt? Guess we won't know since it'll be a LONG time before we try again, if we return at all.  Since it's busy, the food took a while. Fine. No issue there. Once the food got dropped off, our waitress pulled a straight David Copperfield and *poof!*... she vanished. She never returned to our table once to check on us. That's utterly ridiculous as we've been to busier places and had better attention.   When she finally reappeared and noticed both the irritated look on my face and the empty plate that had been sitting there at the end of the table for at least 20 minutes, she FINALLY came to ask if we were done. I asked for a to-go box and a refill of my drink. I got the box but not the drink even though she came out twice more to give refills to the family of three across from us. With my cup clearly empty and at the edge of the table and with a similar look to before, she still didn't get that I wanted another drink.  So, given the lackluster service, she got tipped accordingly. She's lucky I left anything at all, to be honest. I genuinely hope that the management reads and takes action with reviews because this kind of service isn't acceptable.  *edit* So I've seen the same canned reply from management in several posts. It's so nice that they are taking the time to personalize their responses to what seem to be a host of issues despite repeated promises to fix them.",

I wish they had those misters around the bar area as well to cool off the bar goers. I may have ordered a drink or two more had that happened. But instead I was fighting off heatstroke so the liquor came to an abrupt halt.   The totchos were cool but I wish it had more cheese and toppings, towards the end all I got was less than crispy tots.. the arizona dog was a highlight but I was only able to finish half.. will have to give it a fair review on its own one day.  Ultimately if it weren't for thr fights I don't know if I'd venture out here again, but luckily they do and no one closer does, so they will get a future chance at redemption   Side note: the guy next to me was served half cooked chicken fingers, like still pink/red in the middle.. definitely check your meat before biting in to be safe... salmonella is no joke....",

Everyone else got there's and I thought mine would be coming but never did. The waitress was hard to find, would bring beer and then disappear. I finally caught her by standing in the middle of the isle and asked for my bill and advised her I never got my food. Not very apologetic and finally got my bill for my 2 beers. Waited for her to come back to pay and finally just went to the front and asked if I could just pay there. VERY FRUSTRATED!! The food did look AMAZING maybe next time I will get to try it?!?!",

We ordered the Ring of Fire burger which was spicy but pretty yummy and the cheeseburger sliders that came with the au jus sauce for dipping. Both with yummy and smoky burgers! The burgers were definitely the highlight of the meal! The sweet tots were okay and nothing too amazing about them. I would have preferred them to be crunchier and perhaps a choice in dips aside from ketchup. We will definitely be going back again to try their other burgers! I was definitely surprised by how yummy the burgers were and definitely better than Zinburger and Rehab burgers!",

    "text": "Went there this past Friday night.  We have decided as a family that we will place restaurants in a jar, and randomly pick them.  The one rule is that we cannot wine about the selection.    I have been here in the past, and I wasn't too excited when this was picked out of \"the jar of Friday eats\".  I did follow the rules and didn't wine, until after dinner.  Get there around 7ish.  Totally surprised cause there was no line on a Friday night at peak dinner hour.  I was still told that it would be a 15-20 min wait.  It took about 20 mins to get seated so that was a plus.  We get seated and told that our waitress would be right there.  About 15 mins later, our waitress shows up and takes our drink order.  2 beers and 2 ice teas.  20 hungry mins later, the ice teas come.  \"I will be right back with the beers, and will take your order.\"  Here's the thing, I am in a bar and it is taking this long to get a couple of beers?  Well, it felt like forever and the beers came and we give our order.  Food came in a timely manner.  2 hangover burgers, a kids slider, and buffalo chicken sliders.  The burgers were fine, cooked to order so the kids were happy.  Buffalo chicken sliders were too spicy to finish and the tots were blah.  Onion rings were good though.  This probably be the last time we go to this location as our previous visits were kind of the same.  Really, the beers shouldn't take that long to be served, especially in a bar.  Prices seem high and the service wasn't the greatest but it seemed she was serving 12 tables by herself.",

They are the frozen kind you can find at any grocery store except somehow worse than if you were to make them yourself.   The tap water tastes like sewer water.

The parking lot SUCKS but that's not their fault. I hate going to the area simply because it's very difficult to find parking...but if you can get past that frustration, definitely give this place a try. I've had friends try the hot dogs and Mac n cheese, they've said those are good too so if you're not in the mood for a burger I think it's safe to say most everything on the menu will be good.",

    "text": "The end of an era for me.  I have been to the CB&CB in Scottsdale and this one in Chandler, dozens and dozens of times.  This is the first time I have ever had an issue.  I was trying to set up a large party of people and simply arrange for moving two or three tables together.  I had done this many times in the past, and the staff was always respectful and helpful.  On weekends, one cannot make reservations, so I arrived an hour and a half early, and told everyone what was happening.  As my party began to arrive, we asked how we could move tables together.  We were told by our waitress, and by a manager named Derek, that there was a party getting ready to leave behind an already empty table, and we could just then grab that one, and move the two together.  So we moved to the empty table, and waited for the people there to leave.  More of our party was arriving, and having to stand and order drinks, and food, while we waited for the table to clear.  When it did, some of our party moved to the table, but we did not clear it or move the tables ourselves, as we had been instructed that the staff would do that.  In short, it never happened.  All the tables were filled, and no staff ever came and most of my party spent the time standing and expecting something to happen, that was never going to happen.  I finally talked to a manager, who explained to me as though I was an infant, that the tables could not be reserved.  When I told him we were doing what we were instructed to do, he offered to throw me out.  The gathering ended up being 20 persons or so, and CB&CB made some pretty good money.  In all fairness, the place was full, and people were parked illegally all over the parking lot.  They do a big business, and my little problem was just a distraction for the staff.  I, however, will never set foot in any of the chain's locations ever again.  They will miss me, or anyone who asks me for my opinion of the place very little, since they obviously don't need the business.",

After an hour of waiting, still no food and after telling the server we were leaving and would pay for our drinks, the food suddenly appears. The manager seems a little annoyed that we do not want the food and says we can have it to go, which we decline. Manager comments that he bought our food so we should take it, we didn't.

What is not ok for the expo/food runners to not wash there hands more than once on a 5-8 hour shift. They touch there hair, clothes, floor and then stick there bare hands all over your French fry products onto your plate and put bare hands all over your burger.  Water refills? Oh boy they hardly ever wash those glass water bottles and they're all filled from the faucet. Gross.  Let's now talk about management.  Swears at them, flirts openly, and one of them is dating a server which they are all about favoritism if your new.  I wouldn't eat here if I were you. Might get sick or some disease with the careless food handling and lack of good management!! It's also funny they have there employee Adam g harassing me via messages by mistaking me for someone that they use to have work there. Alias' people...alias'. I can also assure all of you that half these reviews on yelp were staged with its employees friends and employees. Believe in this review people. What I say is True. I've seen crazy things in there by barely just watching and befriending employees that tell me everything and complain about everything!!!!",

The bar wasnt busy yet so we were surprised when the waitress told us that it would take a half hour to cook any burger we may order. That's a really long time for a burger in an empty restaurant but, we decided we'd order anyway. We all decided to build our own burgers and when the burgers came out, 2 of our burgers had the ingredients mixed up. Instead of being apologetic, the waitress tried to argue that the mistake was ours. We had to physically compare the burgers we received, to the burgers on the byob slip, before she'd admit they'd made a mistake. The horrible service,  partnered with the fact that they were out of two different beers, we tried to order, on their own beer menu, made for a horrible start to the evening. MY burger was made correctly and was delicious, so I'll give them that, but I will not be returning to this establishment.",

We love the burgers, aps, salads, the mac & cheese is amazing, and we recently tried the hot dogs which were excellent as well. They have a great selection of beer, wine and cocktails. I especially like their Moscow Mule. They have the food/drink/ambiance thing down (love me an open air restaurant), however, being a new location there are noticeably issues with the service. We have been a few times already, and each time the servers themselves are pleasant, however, the service is very slow. Really in every sense, and the kitchen is extra slow.  Also, having been in the business for many years, it irks me when servers do not pick dirty plates before they bring the check, and that has happened each time we have been there. Its not hard--everything off the table that's not being used, offer dessert and/ more drinks, then check. Not here is you check but let me know if you need anything else, and have fun sitting with dirty plates. Hopefully they can get the kinks worked out soon because this is not an issue in Scottsdale, so you know they know how to do it right. I have faith!",

First problem: our waitress, I'm pretty sure it was her first time ever waiting tables and as far as I could tell she only had the 3 tables in the very back corner by the bar and was completely frazzled. Lack of training?? Not sure really. Second problem: the food. I ordered a Juicy Lucy and was expecting the eruption of cheese from the middle of he burger. What I got was a hunk of cheddar that was barely even melted. I'm not a cook, but logic tells you that a half inch or so thick hunk of cheddar is not going to melt...how about using shredded cheese in the middle so it will melt??? Also the hamburger had no flavor and had probably sat for a few minutes (or longer since it took forever to get our food) as it was just luke warm when it came out. We did order the pretzels and they were good.   This place was packed, but I just don't see the draw. Lots of TV's (covering every inch of wall space practically) so if you just want to go watch a game and drink beer it would be ok I guess. Probably won't be back to eat, maybe for a beer after work, but I do hope the service would be much improved. Oh...and how about sporting some of Az sports team banners...Go Cards!",

The french dip was really good, very flavorful and easy to eat...however my burger-expert friend was as disappointed with his cheeseburger as we were back on 3/1...saying the bun was way too thick and the meat was flavorless...not a good combination for a restaurant with the word BURGER in it's name.  The place is still attracting good traffic, so we hope they read these reviews and improve their burgers to justify their high price ($12 - $16).",

    "text": "Dont go here.  It took 1 hour and 40 minutes and a returned order of wings to eat dinner on a Friday night and it was after the crowds thinned.  The wings I got the first time were nasty.  They tasted nasty and old.  The bones were black, literally, and brittle.  I've had a lot of wings at many places nearby and in other cities and states and this was the absolute worst.  Yuck is an understatement.  I've never tasted chicken so bad not seen black brittle bones ever in any state or country.    It took about an hour to get the horrible wings, the person I was with ate their meal but their potatoe chips were cooked in old oil but they ate them anyway out of pure hunger after the hour wait for food.  I eventually got my next order, while my partner sat there and waited.  So disappointing.  What a wasted $70 for dinner for two and it really ruined our evening.    I had happy hour there last Friday and ate there with the same person i had dinner with tonight  even earlier, and it took less than half as long and the food was edible, unlike tonight.  I wont be back, not for a while for sure.  Other than an apology from the waitress nobody did anything to make it right.  If I gave someon rotten meat I cooked on purpose I would at least have a manager out there.  They obviously could care less.  Bad raw chicken smells and is slimy.  No way you can miss it.  And it was so bad.  This is not an oversite. It's an intentional act.  They cooked nasty chicken wings and gave it to me and hoped I would eat it.  Pathetic and inexcusable.  My stomach already feels unsettled because I tried them.  This is unforgivable and they could have cared less.  Unfortunate since I live close by, I'll share my experience with my neighbors believe me.   Guys, you can get people sick with spoiled poultry.  I really recommend you pay attention.  Intentional disregard for customers health, theres no other way to say it.  Plus insanely slow after the rush time. Well, my stomach continues to churn.  Thanks for nothing.",

However, knowing that Sunday's are big business day a restaurant should be prepared. Food delivery was extremely slow. Then when the food was delivered, one meal and part of another meal never came out. The one meal delivered was like warm. The last meal and the side for another meal came out 15 minutes after the initial delivery. This totally unacceptable in any restaurant. All meals should be hot and delivered at the same time. The was still good and the server was prompt in taking order. Having runners bring out food is a preferred method to keep the servers free to bring drinks and service tables. Issues in the kitchen need to be resolved and procedures to follow up on orders need to be implemented.",

Apps - pickles - over cooked, pickles were soggy, fry coming off.  - overall very spicy (if u like that!) Apps - pretzels - greasy kids had to wipe off oil. - cheese dip not a fan there, but if u like beer cheese that tastes like burgers go for it! Apps - buffalo chips ordered with. O blue cheese.  Came with blue cheese had to wait for another and by that time meal was over. Meal - cheese burger - my mistake / golden mustard is actually a weird form of BBQ.  Beware!  I had someone who HATES mustard try it and they said the same.  Ruined my burger.   - took 15 minutes to have a server come over and by that time most were done eating.  My friend (embarrassed) Just said don't worry about it so it didn't get taken care of. Waited 20 minutes with kids on a school night for the check.  Server sort of disappeared and at first was fast but became too busy and forgot about us a lot.  Made for a long night. - fries cold. Kids - tenders / burgers were ok.  Said burger was cold.   September: 2018: 4 stars This place is always busy.  But when u want a burger and shake this is a place to go.  We ordered: 1) Buffalo chicken sliders - very good but a little spicy for our 9 year old.  So we also ordered a kids corn dog meal.   2) Beef Dip - very good.   3) cheddar burger - medium well came out medium and they offered to redo the burger.   If came well done, still not bad!  Artisan bun was a good choice. A few snags with service but corrected quickly and manager took good care of us.  1 star down for service issues.  Waiting 10 minutes for silverware and napkins food got cold i",

The staff is still super friendly and attentive, but the quality of the product was bad.  I went in on Wednesday for Build Your Own Burger night, and me arriving was the only thing that went right.  I ordered a beer while waiting, and it was a bit flat.  My burger was delivered after 20 minutes.  Some of the toppings were cold and there were a number of items missing that I had requested.  My burger was also so salty that I could not eat it.  The staff had a new one made, and when it was delivered, it was still overly salted.  I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the food and beer.  Hopefully this issue is addressed as I really enjoy going to this location.",

We can just run in and out, no need to spend the 50 plus bucks we usually drop there.  Four drinks, 2 rounds of onion dip, and $50 later, we had to waddle home again and take a big nap.  The Tennessee Palmer is a perfect summer beverage, and the onion dip is amazing.  I can't believe we haven't tried that before.  Dani took great care of us at the bar and she was fun to talk to.

In fact I left before my food even Arrived. I had a waitresses named Danny and bless her heart she was great. I ordered my food and I was waiting and I walked to the bathroom and I stopped in my tracks because I heard something I can't forget. A manager to employee conversation.   Manager \"you are behind on dishes and the trash is full.\"  Employee \"I have way too many tickets and I need help, and asked for help and I was ignored, as soon as I catch up on tickets I'll take care of it.\"  Then the manager said while grabbing her wrist \"you really are pathetic, maybe if you actually finished high school, you would be able to move faster and multitask better, if you don't improve I will make sure you are fired.\"   After that I saw her, she walked into the woman's restroom. She looked like she was crying. I don't know her name but she was a shorter Hispanic woman. I immediately walked back to my table and signaled to my waitress Danny and asked what the name of the short manager with the backwards hat was and she said \"does he have a beard?\" And I said yes. So she told me the Manager's name was Jeff. I thanked her and told her to cancel my order and I left. I will never do business with a company that allows management to treat employees that way. I have worked in many kitchens in the past and never seen anything like that. I struggled to graduate high school, so the fact that someone would say something so disgusting to someone that works for them is beyond me. The overall experience was very traumatic and ultimately I advise everyone to stay the hell away from this sweat shop.",

The service was the bare minimum, \"What can I get for you?\" and \"here's your check\", and the menu prices are suggest the ability to substitute but when you do substitute you get charged.  For instance, I ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and asked for ranch dressing instead of bleu cheese.  Yep, I got charged for that.  I am not a big fan of chips and wanted fries.  That will be $2.    If you are interested in mediocre food and service with above average menu prices where you get nickel and dimed on everything, then this is your place.  For me, I will be taking my business to either Oregano's or The Ivy.  One last note, I am surprised the restaurant hasn't started charging its customers for parking.",

He couldn't say anything except well they are put on a grill and said you can't expect us to grill them completely it would take over 30 minutes. Well saying your own menu says they are grilled, yes I do expect them to be grilled. Do you deep fat fry your grilled chicken sandwich?

All Burgers , cost around 11 to 15 and a 18 burger is on the list which is monster.  Chips are the standard side, so if you want fries or totes it will cost an extra 2 dollars onto your burger .  The servicers if you get a lady are pretty and polite. When our order came in , they got one of our sides wrong, but they corrected it and gave us a full order to go no charge . So thank you.

We had to interrupt them to get their attention. Then we got seated and waited 15 minutes with no one stoping to even get a drink order. Finally a hostess dropped off water and left. We then had to flag down another hostess to ask for a server...5 minutes later...Still no one. So we left and went next door to BLD...Fast service and fantastic food.",

This is bar food, and it is so good!  You'll need to throw your diet out the window when you dine at Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers, but you'll be so happy you did.  Since you decided to use your cheat day at this fine establishment, you may also choose from nearly 100 beers, nearly half on tap.  The beer list covers the full spectrum, with many local selections highlighted.  They were packed on the Friday evening I stopped in with some coworkers, but we got seated pretty quick.  Service was in quite a hurry the whole night, but our waitress was very friendly and she was managing a lot of tables.  She did well and our food and drinks came out without mistakes.  I had the Chicago char dog and it was just perfect.  If you're craving cold beer and (insert guilty bar food here), this is your place.",

One time they couldn't get the game after waiting 20 minutes for the owner. The second time they got the game but refused to put the sound on unless it was football. We were one of three tables in the whole restaurant at 11am Monday morning. The bathroom toilets leak and are rusting, there are holes in the bathroom walls. It's not worth paying $14 for a burger, $10 for fries. Last time we will come back.",

I guess the 2 star really reflects the idea of a sports bar charging over $10 for cheese burger.  I know inflation and maybe I'm old school.  I just don't see the value in the quality or the taste.  And especially the lacking service. The valet thing bothers me too. So I have to park and walk because valet but is holding all the spots.  This is not beverly hills I'm not parking valet to go to a strip mall to get a cheese burger and watch sports.",

She clearly was not in the mood to connect with new customers in the bar; therefore, food was late and she didn't care to acknowledge the horrible service we were receiving. In addition, shared concern with one of the Managers, who did not care to follow up about our food taking so long. As someone who has been in the service industry, I was extremely livid. I was embarrassed not leave an at least 15% tip, so I did. We are very respectful and always are patient with service, especially since we realize people need to do side work and get ready for turn over. Unfortunately, I will never go to this location again. Thank you for the other Manager who listened to my complaint and was very apologetic.",

There are 42 TV's in this place so watching the big game won't be a problem. Their beer list seems to get even better as time marches on. The service was spot on and the bartender Jerome is amazing.  I know they just opened and like anything I am sure there was some hiccups along the way, but not on my visit.

The bartender, Kim, walked passed me a few times and didn't even acknowledge I was sitting there.  I have on a bright pink sweatshirt AND the sun is still out.  Finally, the bus boy went to get her.  Finally she came over, took my drink order and then disappeared again.   When she walks by, I had to flag her down to take my order.  Someone brought my order to me, not my server, and I didn't see her again until I had to waive her down for the check.  Now - I know how important it is to tip at least 20% when your server meets your expectations and go up (or down) from there.  This is a perfect example of the rare time I will be giving less than 20%.  I'm certain I will have to waive her down to have her run my card for the bill.  Oh - she is not the only server behind the bar...there are at least two others back there.",

We can afford the charge but it seems petty given the burger came with cheese in the first place. They have a great atmosphere and good beer selection. The staff has also been very nice.

Ordered a Stella and Ring of Fire burger, both were good and the burger had the advertised kick to it.  As for the service...my waitress went MIA right after she dropped it off (without silverware or napkins initially); when my beer finished I really needed a lemonade to quench the fire associated with the burger, but she never came by to see how I was doing.  All of a sudden a guy in a white shirt and trendy tie starts walking down the aisle....aha, the manager, he will ask how things are and I can tell him I need a lemonade.  But no, with his eyes glued straight ahead, he walks back in the kitchen. Finally the hostess walks by and gets me my lemonade.  Basically most of the waitresses seemed more intent on socializing with each other than catering to their customers.  At least they didn't charge me for the lemonade.  I can just see this place going down in a couple of years due to the nonchalant service and don't-give-a-hoot management, and the higher-ups of the chain scratching their head saying \"all the studies show people really like our product\"...  Others have noted the parking fiasco here, my first attempt to dine here led to me giving up and going elsewhere.  Fortunately I can walk from my house to the place so that is the only way I'll do it from now on.",

We sat right in front of the hostess stand. 20 minutes later I finally go ask her how much longer. And she says \"Oh I notified you 10 minutes ago. I must have gotten the number wrong.\" Really...we were right in front of you. I was a hostess before and the job is not hard. You remember people.  Bad first experience. But I brushed it off my shoulder. Requested a table and a server gave it to us. The hostess also said the patio was filled with large parties taking up tables. There were at least 5 tables available and no large parties. (Again I worked in a restaurant for 4 years)  Our server was very good. My boyfriend and I ordered the pretzel and cheese dip app which was excellent and because we are pretty skinny and get full easily we always split an entree.   The Monterey Chicken Sandwich was delicious it came out on split plates and was the perfect portion for us to share.   Then we got the bill. Where they charged us 2.00 to split the entree. Um...way to let us know? Server did not even tell us there would be an additional charge.  We are not cheap people as we were drinking beers and we go out to eat all the time. BUT we don't like to waste money on bogus charges. We WOULD have split it ourselves. So they got two more dollars out of us...but lost more money as we probably would have been back a lot more if it wasn't for that charge.   So disappointed. Could have been a great hangout place on the weekends.",

The food has always come out hot and well prepared. They have a great wait staff and this place is definitely worth any wait you may have.",

After another 15 minutes, they finally seated us and offered no further apology or discount. Our server wasn't friendly. They did a poor job of updating the TVs with the current football games- we politely asked a few times, and each time we received a rude short answer of \"they're working on it.\" Well over a half hour post start time, they put the game on the TV. The food was fine and came out relatively quickly, and the mimosa special of $10 for the first one, and $1 for refills was great. But it was clear the servers were disappointed and took their time bringing the cheap refills out.",

We then noticed how many servers have large heads of great hair, long and flowing all over the place.    How about a new house rule to pull your hair back so it's not in the food?

We went for the first time on date night, come to find out $60 later after two beers, and two burgers we weren't very happy. We waited for about 45 minutes for two cheeseburgers that weren't complicated what so ever & when they came out the bottom of our buns were so soggy grease was dripping off..we also got two small beers which we loved. Once we got the check we were shocked at the price. We went again with our moms a few days ago & tried some appetizers which were great, got another burger, some salads, and a sand which. The burger was yet again soaked in grease to the point where we didn't eat it, the tater tots are wonderful, and sand which was okay. We most likely won't be there again unless it's pay day on a big game day.",

Not bad but would be so much better with beer cheese. The water is not filtered which is a personal pet peeve. Drinking liquid minerals and dirt is flat out nasty.

I wish they would offer some of their specialty burgers in sliders-  would love to try some of the edgier burgers but don't want to commit to the whole thing haha  There is alot of bun- but they are so filled with ingredients i usuallly end up eating them with a fork any way.    Best place for a first date so you can REALLY see who they are :)",

We came during the NBA Finals so it was packed and wait time was 30-50 minutes.  We came right in and went to the patio.  Once we ordered and received our drinks it's was a pretty cool atmosphere.   I had a bug in my drink so the bar replaced it no questions asked. ( since I was outside I figured it fell probably from the tree or something because it wasn't there when I got the drink). The service was great and our waitress Hannah was awesome.  She made sure we were taken care of and I really felt like the customer service was number one.   Definitely will come back food was great and my drink was good as well.",

It needed some heat (spice wise) but the tables come stocked with Tabasco.  The Tabasco added to the burger took it up a notch. Not a drinker, so I couldn't comment on the beer part.

    "text": "I wanted so bad to like this place. How can you not like gourmet burgers and beer? First of all the service is questionable. Although my first impression wasn't great I gave it another try with the same results. On my first visit we ordered the salted pretzel, Ring of Fire burger and bacon Mac n cheese. The pretzel was good. The burger was ok but not exceptional. I was expecting a flavor explosion with the description of the toppings for the burger, however, it wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped. The bun to meat ratio is definitely off. Way too much bun! The Mac n cheese was barely edible. It was like eating over cooked noodles in a soupy Alfredo sauce. Flavorless and bland. I also was not a fan of the sweet potato tater tots.  My next visit was about the same. It was lunch and wasn't very busy but our waitress was horrible. We did a build your own burger and they literally forgot over half of the toppings we requested. We kept having to ask for them on the side. That was frustrating since our waitress was MIA most of the time our lunch took nearly two hours! The onion rings were fantastic! We definitely enjoyed those! On a positive note we did talk to the manager who was extremely nice and apologized got our experience and removed our burger from the bill. We didn't expect that and it was a pleasant surprise. I know the restaurant just recently opened and is going to have some growing pains but in not giving up and will return again! I think the potential is there and I want to see it succeed.",

I give a star because of all the TV's and an extra Star because, what can you expect from a sports bar?

To start, the hostess was very welcoming and had a huge smile on his face ready to seat us. It was also moderately busy but not annoyingly busy.   I warned my friend a head of time to not be surprised of the magic I will be performing on this burger! The burger was medium well and delicious! I regretted not adding the over medium egg (every burger should have added protein). I had to cut it in half because you know, I'm not a monster. The textures in this burger were amazing and I like how it wasn't a dry burger.   The sweet potato tots were really good and HOT! My only issue was it took a minute to get them as I think my waitress forgot to give them to us.   The mule was fresh had basil and cucumber. I am obsessed with mules and wanted to try the Jameson but admittedly it looked dangerous as I needed to drive home  and normally don't do dark liquor. I also had a sprite which in my opinion was flat(I had my friend test it and it wasn't just me).   My friend had the wings (two spicy toppings) and two craft beers( one was the beer of the month) which got a \"eh,it's ok\" and \"I'm surprised they chose this one as the beer of the month\".   Overall, the setting was nice especially after a day of work and just wanting to throw down on a burger. I would recommend for sure.",

We sat ourselves upon arrival and when the waitress came over she didn't seem to know about the special or beer special that was also included. We asked a few questions and she kept having to leave (for a long time) to get answers. She said she was new so we didn't read too much into it. The food came out pretty quickly and I really enjoyed the sweet potato tots, but thought the burger was way too greasy. I had my card sitting on the table because it was taking a very long time for her to return, thought that may help her get the hint? Well instead of dropping the bill off she just scooped up my card and rang me up. The issue was she never took off the promo special :( well I flat down the bus boy after a bit because again I can't find her, she says she fixes it, but only took off one special and never reversed the first charge. So at this point I'm out over $60 and haven't even seen the correct bill. I asked for a manager and he was able to fix everything, pending charges eventually dropped off, and he gave us 10% discount for the madness. Honestly, I'm not sure we'll be back after spending more time dealing with the mess than actually eating. Sounds like the servers need more training.",

We came in for the last game of the NBA finals (sweep sweep sweep) but were told that the wait was over an hour. No surprise, but we were more than happy to take a couple of seats at the bar.  There were TVs everywhere and the bar staff was super friendly (shout out to Auston), even joking around with us as we took photos for Yelp.  When the sun started to set and get a little too bright one of the bar backs even put up a menu to block the glare (TY Latimore!)  The burgers were very delicious and although priced on the high-end, very much worth it. Hell, even my little Caesar side salad was really delicious.  Our favorite though is the Papago Orange Blossom on draft; just an incredible beer.  We didn't get them this time but I can tell you from experience that the s'mores they offer up are perfect end to a meal.  Definitely one of my favorite burger spots in the valley.",

    "text": "10 Patty Burger Challenge Review:  Choose a burger with 3-14 pattys and finish it faster than the previous record. I did 10.   Ambiance: 4/5 I like how this location has an area a little separate from the bar area with booths that I could enjoy a meal with my family at without being right next to patrons that came to enjoy a sports event.   Taste: 5/5 Each of the 10 patties was a nice medium rare. It gets a little dry after the 1st 2 patties because there are not condiments between the layers. I think that's the norm though, as ever location has been that way, so I got a side of mayo. The onions, pickles, and other toppings are at the top and bottom of the burger, this has been at every location as well. It makes the bottom bun soggy, but that actually helps with getting down the last few patties.  Challenge description: 5/5 The challenge was as described, 10 patties, 10 pieces of cheese, and a normal amount of toppings.   Staff: The waitresses were nice, accommodating to my family and myself during the challenge, and supportive.  Time: 36:34  Difficulty: 4.5/5 (for the 10 patty And time)  Prizes: A shirt, and a free meal. Plus your record on the wall.  Thank you to everyone at cold beers do being so accommodating to me and my family.",

We weren't adventerous enough to try the PB&J sliders, maybe next time!  Lastly, the burger was really good.  1/2 lb burgers cooked at a perfect medium for me and medium rare for my boyfriend.

    "text": "Pains me to go 3 STARS here. I love this place. It's totally recoverable though. Let me explain.  Strong burger game here, damn near unparalleled. Great Atmo. Awesome service. Darcie and I sat at the bar and met Eric, our Bartender/Server. He was friendly, knowledgeable (esp on the 20 new beers on tap), dude was sporting a 1%-body-fat V-shape that should have had the ladies lined up out to Higley. Yeah, Darcie had NO issue sitting at the bar. But really, dude can't compete with my 52-year-old dad bod and beautiful bald head. Sometimes I just feel sorry for these handsome, young 2nd-placers. Yeeeeeeeee! ;)  Anyway. Adonis, er ah... Eric was awesome.  So, what went wrong? Thanks for getting me back on track.  #1 - The Pretzel Dip. The pretzels themselves are top shelf. They come out perfectly prepared, hot like the Sun, with texture to die for. {Needle rips across record} But DAMN! The dipping sauce is nasty. NazTAY! One try, and I was like: \"Eric, gonna need a To-Go box for these two tasty pretzels.\"   I admit, I should have told him why. I should have said that I would be enjoying those pretzels a later time with a vastly superior dipping option called (Dun dun DA!) Tostitos Salsa Con Queso. But friends and neighbors, I had sat at the bar and started with a Space Dust. And you know damn well that cognition rapidly ebbs away as one of those disappears.  I think CB&C starts on the right path with their dip. It's got Nacho Cheese in it. Core success ingredient for sure. But then they add ASS. And things go horribly wrong. I would have been equally upset had I gotten some of it on the bottom of my shoe. Really, I was there about 6 hours ago and just typing this review has my lip curled, nose scrunched, and stomach somersaulting. Yikes! I'll add a sauce alternative at the end of the review... if anything, just to show I love ya and want to help.  #2 - The Side of Fries Jack. I would def prefer to exhaustively extoll the virtues of perhaps the best burger I have had in years, but the fry situation eclipsed said burger and pulled me down from cloud 9... and rivetted me in place. I could not stop thinking about the fact that I had paid $2 bucks for 27 fries. OK, typing that, it seems petty, but there were so few fries on my plate that it was easy to count them... and I could not stop myself from doing so. By easy, I mean, I did not have to move the burger or the onion rings on the plate and I did not have to whip out my finger and point while counting. 27. Nor were these fries huge. They were all less than 2\" inches in length with most over 1.25\". Sup Wit Dat? Did I tell my big homie Eric? No. Again. Space Dust. And I had moved on to a Coffee Kolsch (Oh my sweet Lord it was good).  So how do we restore the 5 STAR rating?  Let's start easy. Jump back in the kitchen and let the crew know they are executing in near top-notch form. Following the well-earned praise and encouragement, set the record straight that fries are not Bitcoin and should not be rationed as if they are. I really think this fry sitch was an oversite, but someone should really have noticed that quality/value deficiency. You guys get enough heat for being a bit pricey. Customer goodwill builds that return business and word-of-mouth.  OK, the pretzel dip. You can go so many far better ways. Here're a few:  a: Just go with regular Nacho Cheese. If this is already an option you should clearly state it. If it's not, please make it one for the love of God. Then retrain: \"OK, with the pretzel order do you want your dip regular or nasty?\" Actually, just completely get rid of that other dip atrocity.   b: Go premium with Tow Truck Todd's Queso -  -1 pack of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage -1 block of Velveeta  -1 can of RO-TEL -1 or 2 diced Jalapenos In a medium pan or large skillet. Brown the sausage on medium heat. Pour off most of the fat. Return to heat. Thrown in the jalapenos. Cook 1-2 minutes. Begin adding the Velveeta in chunks to speed melting. Add the RO-TEL. Stir until fully melted and mixed. Drop heat to low and enjoy.   Todd's my buddy. He showed me the recipe, it's awesome, I'm a fan. And you will be too.  Guys, if I was running the show, I'd kill your current dip and go Regular Nacho Cheese and offer Todd's as a $1 upgrade.   Best of luck. I'll be back later, carrying a few extra STARS and high hopes.  Via Con Queso. :)",

After about 30 minutes of arriving back at home I was incredibly sick all the way through Monday afternoon due to food poisoning. Next time I'll stay away from the wings.",

    "text": "If you like a big messy burger and slow service then this place is for you!   Walked in here on a whim when Oregano's had a 40 minute wait and our party of 5 was able to sit immediately - there were a number of open tables.  Our issue was the slow and inattentive service. We got our menus right away and the server was friendly enough, but it took 15 minutes for her to get 2 bottled beers and waters. Then it took 50 minutes for our food to come out, it was late and we were already hungry so we were all quite hangry by that time. We didn't think it was a crazy order either - 4 burgers and a buffalo chicken. During that time, our waitress never came back to check on us or ask if anyone wanted another drink, refill waters, nothing. The guys at the table wanted to order more beers. She came back after the food was out to ask how it was but at that point it was a little late.  The food itself was pretty good. 4 out of 5 people ordered burgers, everyone liked their burgers but they were really messy. The buffalo chicken in a lettuce wrap was good but the chicken was a bit over-cooked. I'm told the fries were average but the coleslaw was good. The other nice thing is they had a gluten friendly menu which was helpful.  Overall pretty good food, but the experience was ruined by the service. It shouldn't have taken nearly an hour for burgers to come out on a Sunday night that was far from packed. And our waitress at least refilling drinks and letting us know the status of the order or checking in would have left a better impression.",

We weren't allowed to order food when ready for some reason, and then we got to watch the two tables next to us be visited by our waitress a half dozen times and a manager or bar tender twice who offered to take their orders but ignored our waves and polite \"Hi's.\" I'd like to think it's not because two of my co-patrons aren't white but the tables around us with adequate service weren't of mixed heritage and didn't have similar dearth's of interaction...  I wish it ended here but our orders weren't correct, I'm still waiting 30 minutes, and a completed plate later, for a condiment and I finished my dinner before one of the three entrees was delivered as ordered. Good news though... We're done so the waitress is super attentive about delivering and collecting our checks.",

Mind you our waitress asked once how our food was while she ran off and didn't come back for a while because she was waiting the whole restaurant.

We had the buffalo chicken dip which was IMO way too spicy to enjoy. For dinner I tried the Mac and cheese burger which I asked to be cooked medium, and a side of onion rings. The burger came out too dry for my liking and quite honestly the taste was bland. I've had better Mac and cheese burgers at the Cheesecake Factory. My BF had the Steakhouse burger which he said was decent but really rich. He got a side of the sweet potato tots which were tasty. The best part was ordering the table side smores. They bring out a plate of graham crackers, chocolate and marshmallows and you are able to roast the marshmallows right at your table... Pretty neat! We'd probably go back again for beers and a game but the food was meh.",

I ordered a regular burger for the main course and it was delicious.  Juicy and cooked perfectly.  Now for the beer.  I like amber and brown beers and their selection is fantastic.  If there was one negative it would have to be the parking.  I went during happy hour on a Friday so I expected it to be busy but parking was a pain for my group.  I was able to find a spot in the strip mall parking lot but other people in my group needed to park down the road.  I don't consider this a big enough negative to take a star away.  I highly recommend Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers.",

She was friendly and personable yet efficient and professional.  She provided just the right kind of help, not too much and not annoying but just when you want something she was there, only too happy to give extra and above customer service..  It is only the second time I have eaten there, and I can say with all honesty, it is constantly good.  This was a great treat for both of us.",

She did not know happy hour specials for preferred not tell us because had I known that there were many specials like craft beer and appetizers I would have gotten food. Unfortunately I was not informed of any of this and just got a beer. Then I was not informed that happy hour ends at 6 p.m. opposed to 7 p.m. like some places and being 5 minutes late after happy hour I was still informed that it ended she did not check on us beforehand to see if we wanted anything before happy hour ended. So I can't tell you how the food on happy hour taste for how the craft beers on happy hour were because I was not informed and then not even allowed to get a regular beer after happy hour. Not a good experience will not be back",

I often don't mind an inattentive server, I don't like to be in a rush when I eat, but they push that boundary even for me. I was also extremely dissapointed when they started adding an extra charge for French fries. IMO if you pay 12+ dollars for a burger the fries should always be included.",

Sadly enough we will never return after our last adventure. On a not so busy night our food took far too long to arrive. After ordering my burger on the well side of medium, taking my second bite I thought to myself I didn't order guacamole or any other item \"cold, slimy, pasty\" on my burger.  I was right, I didn't! What I was feeling was 100% uncooked, raw meat. I never and I mean never send food back. I did this time as it was disgusting at best. They cooked me a new burger, that I choked down. No manager apology, no break on the bill. And fun is just to begin. It hits me ten minutes after getting home. I will spare you the details. COLD BEERS & CHEESEBURGERS & FOOD POISINING!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I was hesitant to try this restaurant due to the mixed ratings here on Yelp but decided to give it a try since the couple we were with wanted \"American food\". We arrived at about 6:15 on a Saturday evening. Parking is a challenge, they do offer complimentary valet but after one pass through the parking lot we found a self-park spot at the far end of the lot. Our group of four was greeted promptly and found that it would be about a 15 minute wait for an inside table or we could be seated outside right away. We opted for outside on the patio. It is smoke-free and shaded plus the misters were doing a great job at cooling, it was very comfortable outside. Multiple TVs all around showing a good variety of football games. Each of us ordered a different type of burger and everyone was happy with their orders - the Juicy Lucy, the Hangover, the Bacon Bleu and the All-American, each was cooked perfectly and the even medium-well was still nice and juicy. I recommend trying the sweet potato tots for your side. Yes, it is generally between $11 and $14 for a burger ($18 for a double!) - not cheap but beer was cold and burgers were flavorful. Our server was friendly and attentive but did not rush us as we enjoyed a couple of beers before placing our order. Next time we will skip dessert, the brownie sundae was pretty basic and not really worth the $6.  All in all a nice night out and we will be back.",

    "text": "Today was my first time here since Uncle Bear's closed.  I came alone after a day of moving into a new home, was hungry and thirsty and this place is nearby.  I sat at the bar, and ordered a beer and a plain old hot dog and fries.  Just one order for just one me.  The beer was great, and the beer was all I had for about 30 mins, and the bartender was MIA.  A server appeared and brought me not one but two  orders of hot dogs that had stuff on them I did not request and wouldn't request.  I explained to her what my order was for, and she repeated it all as if I just changed my order.  She went away, and a few mins later the bartender resurfaced, noticed I had no food but didn't say a word; she went to the kitchen, came back and said they will fix my order, and confirmed that I really wanted a plain dog with fries.  When I added \"they brought me two, I just need one\", I didn't get much of a response.  I quickly received my original order, and the server seemed very perturbed to have to be doing that.  (Sorry my not wanting the wrong order has irritated you?)  The bartender didn't utter a word to me the rest of my visit, and left at the end of her shift without letting me know someone else would be helping me.  (I figured that part out as I watched her grab her purse and leave, then noticed a Ninja bartender guy looking my way and asked him for my check; thanks bartender guy!)  The food was great.  The service was horrible (except the bartender guy).  Maybe I just came in on a bad day.  (And I was polite the entire time, so no, I wasn't one of those nasty customers lol!)",

I decided that I wanted to keep it low key for my birthday dinner this year with us being new to area and not really knowing anyone so we decided to give the Chandler location a shot. I LOVE smores and they have that on their dessert menu so it seemed like a good fit. Well... it wasn't. The entire staff ,except for the manager and the sweet food runner,  looked like they hated their jobs. RBF everywhere.. We were seated inside bc there wasn't any seating outside which wasn't a problem. Once sat, our server didn't come to get our drink orders for at least nine minutes. We just sat there ignored. When are server did come up she asked what we wanted to drink abruptly and walked off... I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt that maybe she was rushing and overwhelmed.. no.. her entire interaction with us was rude and abrupt.. I tried to ask her a question.. she said what's up? When we did get our food, my sandwich was on white instead of whole wheat.. when we could finally flag her down to let her know the sandwich sat on the table for another five minutes before they came to get it to switch it out. My husband ordered small beers, they continued to bring him large beers.  All in all it was a bad experience. The food was okay but the service made it much worse. By the end of it I didn't even get my smores bc I was so sick of the bad service that I just wanted to leave.",

OH MY GOD we have food poisoning.  Well, up & down all night puking & on the toilet.  Twenty four hours later & we still feel like heck!  Called them & asked to speak with the manager.  He gets on the phone & is so obtuse about what has happened to us.  Says sorry & hangs up.  Doesn't even ask how we are doing now & if they can make it up someway.  I have our leftovers & I am calling the Health Department tomorrow.  This place was also filthy & the menus & tables were sticky& gross.  Take my advise go to Five Guys or Smashburger for a far superior burger & fries.  If I could I would rate them a negative 10.  This place sucks.",

Mr. Coke was right there waiting.  I got the Open Pit burger, and it didn't disappoint.  Probably could have used a bit more BBQ sauce.  Housemade chips were also good.  The folks got the All-American burger which is a bargain at $8 from the HH menu, how could you go wrong.    All in all, a great food experience.  Plenty (and I mean plenty) of TVs to watch.

The hostess was nice. And so was my server, Brittany.  I ordered the CB& CB burger; Burger with carmelized onions, and a garlic aioli. I asked for it med/well. I think it came out closer to medium..but it wasn't cold and raw..so I could deal with it.  That was the only complaint I had for the burger.  Otherwise, it was big and tasty. I got the regular tater tots as my side.  YUMMM!  They were crispy, hot, and seasoned great!  Kinda lame that they charge you an extra 2 bucks for those.

There isn't anyone here and yet our order took more than an hour to come out. Then on top of that our food was cold. I get sometimes food can take forever but never this long. I can just imagine how it is on their busy nights. Never again coming here. Also the manger was very rude when we talked to her about the issue. As a manger you need better customer service.",

Although I am typically a PBR and Tequila guy I was happy to see the Leinenkugel's sign since being from Wisconsin and my fiance went to school with the owners.  I was disappointed they only had only one choice of it.   Oh well, other than that the service was good but a bit busier than I like. ( i prefer a quieter setting)  All in all I give it a thumbs up and will try again sometime. I do prefer Wimpy's in downtown Chandler though.",

We were very impressed at the taste and presentation of the food. Parking was terrible too, we had to actually park at the CVS and walk across the street to get there as the entire lot was full!",

However, if you drink mixed drinks be prepared to pay for an overpriced WEAK drink.  This place does the \"corporate pour\", so the drinks are really weak.  My husband and I were talking about how weak my margarita was, and a bartender blurted out \"We put a whole shot in it\".  REALLY?  a whole shot?  Wow.  Then she said she would have to charge us extra if we wanted it stronger.  Meanwhile the margarita was already overpriced for the tiny amount of tequila in it.   If you want a REAL mixed drink, go to a family owned bar where the bartenders are allowed to make their drinks the way the want to and the way they should.  You can get a better made margarita at a cheaper price elsewhere.",

    "text": "We did return last week for the first time in about a year.  This time we arrived early and didn't have to hike the parking lot.  However the service this time really was sub-par.  Twice I had to wave my arms to flag my waitress down to get her to visit the table, refill drinks, etc.    Aside from the service, here's the thing that drops my rating to two stars:  I ordered onion rings with my burger.  When my food arrived, there was no ranch, bbq sauce or other condiment to dip my rings in.  I asked for some dressing.  When I got the bill I found I was charged for a couple ounces of dressing.  Now, when you charge between $11 and $18 for a burger and chips, do you REALLY need to tack on another 50 cents for a small condiment serving.  It's not the amount, it's that you have to nickel and dime your customers when your prices are already premium.  I could buy a pizza and feed a family of four for what you charge for a cheeseburger and chips.  Do you really need to add that extra .50??  This time, in order to keep the tab in the two figure range, we skipped the beers.  It was \"Cold Water and Cheeseburgers\", LOL!!  I was genuinely surprised the water was free.  Again, just to balance the review, the food was, as always, amazing.  The host staff at the front door was friendly and we were welcomed and seated quickly.  We will probably be back.  Unlike other restaurants in the area, CBCB is not one that we will visit with any regularity.  Edit: One last thing.  If you get the \"Juicy Lucy\" burger (my first time), don't cut it in half.  There is a hunk of melted cheese in the center that liquifies as it cooks and will squirt all over your clean shirt and shorts the minute you plunge a knife into the burger, thus ending the \"Juicy\" part of \"Lucy\" and leaving you with a dried out burger and a laundry pre-soak job.  Careful biting into it also.",

Probably one of the better sports bars I've been to in awhile! Televisions everywhere, enough to keep you hanging out for awhile to watch your favorite game! I decided to try a cheeseburger and needless to say, you get your money's worth. Probably the biggest cheese burger patty I've had in a very long time. Puts Red Robin to shame! Food was cooked to my liking and served in a timely fashion. Chips were a little over cooked, but still good enough to eat. Waitress were friendly and responsive. Overall a very fun sports bar experience! Would recommend if you are trying to catch a game with a group of friends on the weekend!",

For $12 you get unlimited toppings. They have a preset menu that you check off what toppings you want which includes all different kinds of vegetables, cheeses and meats. The portions are big enough that you definitely have enough left over for a second meal. Other things on the menu that are good are their tot chos which are nachos made with tots instead of chips. Delicious and not nutritious. You can also make your own s'mores. They bring what looks like a Bunsen burner and you roast your marshmallows over it. This location also has a fireplace outside for the winter time.",

    "text": "Our last visit was in March 2015 and I gave them 1 Star (read that review and you'll see why) and we waited over 4 years to try them again. For some reason they simply can't get an order right. I'm not entirely sure where the blame rests either on the cooks or the servers but it's been an issue on both visits.  We sat at the bar again and were greeted right away. I got the JD Lemonade and subbed Titos Vodka instead of JD and my wife did the same with her Cucumber Sun instead of Gin. Both drinks came quick and were excellent. They also brought us waters without having to ask. Much appreciated.   We started with the Jumbo Salted Pretzel w/roasted pepper cheese sauce. I highly recommend. We both went with the BYOB burger and added fries. From a price perspective it gets a bit ridiculous to have a $16.00 burger that comes with chips and you have to pay a $2 up-charge for fries. $18 for a burger and fries is pushing it quite a bit.   My burger came out as ordered and was excellent. My wife's came with BBQ sauce which she didn't order and can't stand. The bartender apologized and said we'll remake that for you. It took over 15 min to return with her meal and instead of remaking her BYOB they remade mine for her. Completely different than what she ordered and since I like mine spicy and she doesn't she wasn't going to just eat it considering how long it took and the fact that I was already finished with my meal. At this point we were ready to go and didn't want to wait for another remake.   In the end the bartender took the cost of her meal off the bill but didn't do anything else to compensate for the fact that she didn't eat. If I were the server I would've got the manager involved, insisted we remake her meal so she could at least take it to go and deduct something extra off the bill to make it right. She essentially did nothing and our 2nd visit ended much like our first visit in disappointment.",

Slow, rude, my order never comes out the way I want it. Last night a few friends and I decided to go there and literally it took an hour and half to get our COLD food, yet the burgers were burnt!

We upgraded one of our sides to Truffle Fries for $5 and they were not worth it. They were tossed in some herbs and grated Parmesan- none of which stuck to the actually fries- so you'd end up with a bite of a normal French fry and a little pile of herbs and Parmesan at the bottom of the bowl.",

So I started my evening with a cold beer. I drank  the lumberyard red. Worth giving this beer a try, I found it was better tasting than the Killians red that you've probably had before. Plus, I haven't noticed Killian's in the retail stores for a while.   OK, I didn't feel like eating the namesake cheeseburger today, so I gave the prime rib dip a try and was totally pleased.   Juicy beef Prime rib with cheese nicely laid out on a fresh baked bun with ajous for dipping.   The tavern decor was enhanced by walls of television sets that were tuned to every sports broadcast available.  The table service was fast and highly efficient and you'll find there's plenty of free off-street parking available.   The next time you're heading south of Phoenix and need food and beverages, then Cold beers and cheeseburgers will be a welcome stop, a simple refuel solution.  Salute!",

Some of the other burgers have some serious heat, but I wasn't ready to handle that without a beer or cocktail for but I had to get a side of the garlic aioli which is rich and creamy and is used for my spread on the burger and dip for my fries.

We felt rushed from the moment we sat down by our server, Tay. After we ordered our food, which didn't come out as ordered, we were nearly finished with our meals by the time we were checked on (by anyone, let alone our server). By then our drinks were empty and we were ready to leave lI asked for the check and nearly 20 minutes later she came back to collect payment.   I understand that servers get behind when it's busy, but that was not the case tonight. I have seen this place much more busy on a Friday night and had flawless service, tonight was a joke.   **After getting a response on this review from Tatum, who I assume is a manager, I responded in email as requested. I have yet to get a reply. Why ask me to email you if you're not going to respond? Not sure if they just do it to \"save face\" with the public, but I have yet to go back to this location due to the unprofessionalism. Which is too bad because it is the closest location to my home in Chandler.",

Great bar food and the portion sizes are huge. The only reason I am giving this place a 3 stars is cause the service at this location seriously LACKS. I was so excited when this place opened since I no longer had to travel to Old Town when craving a burger. But I had not been to this location in awhile, and visited on Valentines day, and the hostess were not friendly or personable at ALL. How come every time i visit I get a waitress that could care less about checking in on our table? Its not like I want to be bugged every 5 minutes asking how things are, but I would like to be checked in for re-fills or extra napkins. Our waitress seemed like it was a huge task to bring us more water. Other than the lack of personable workers, or sucky service you cannot go wrong with the food. If you wanted good service along with the food, I would suggest going to the Old Town Location. I have never had trouble with service there!",

But the reason I gave your restaurant a 5 star rating and let alone a review to begin with was due to one of your servers. Vanessa was our server for our visit yesterday  (1/17) and her customer service skills deserve the highest praise available. We were seated after a short wait due to the football games going on. And as we were being seated, our server, Vanessa was heading to another one of her tables with drinks still stopped by, introduced herself very quickly and said she would be right back to get our drink order.  I found this pleasant because usually servers don't acknowledge customers until they come to their table to take orders. Upon returning Vanessa gave us the run down of the menu and drink options. Vanessa knew the menu inside and out and was able to describe the meals to perfection. We ended up ordering the tots, and a burger to share. The accuracy in which she described the taste of the two items before we even tasted them was incredible. She was polite, courteous and prompt when we would request another drink or napkins, etc. My gf and I aren't exactly the easiest customers to serve but she handled our orders and needs with ease and professionalism. This was our first visit to your restaurant and due to the wonderful service that Vanessa showed us, we will definitely be back. She deserves some sort of acknowledgement and praise for her customer service skills. Thank you Vanessa",

They tout having award winning burgers, but I don't think there was anything spectacular about the food. We tried four different burgers between us, only one of which I would consider going back for. We tried the Open Pit Burger: Barely any BBQ sauce on this one, which left it dry and a little bland. Also tried the Rocky Point Burger: pretty good, I'm still not sure how I feel about sour cream on a burger but it kinda worked on this one. The Hawaiian: small piece of canned pineapple for a big burger, the proportions just didn't really work for me and the flavor was lacking (could have at least grilled the pineapple...). The only one that I did enjoy more than the others was the Steakhouse Truffle: The flavors went well together and the burger was juicy. All of their burgers are served with (burnt) chips and you have to pay $2 additional to upgrade to another side, including fries. The fries were very good, I will say I enjoyed those much better than the chips that originally came with the meal. Otherwise for price and quality you might as well go to Red Robin or any other burger chain.",

    "text": "First time here. Really good first impression. Went on a Saturday night around 5pm and had to wait 15-20 minutes which seemed reasonable considering the place was full. If I could think of anything negative it would be that the hostess's seemed a little immature (3 of them standing around being silly) and way off on their \"wait time\" to customers, they have the \"No Wait\" app and when we walked in there wasn't supposed to be a wait, there was a bigger table open that they ended up giving to a party of 6 that came in 15 minutes after everyone else was waiting (with no reservations). We had an awesome server, food didn't take long to come out at all and the temperature on the burgers were perfect. Personally I thought the beer prices were high but they had a modest selection of different drafts which was nice. Definitely will be back!",

But I don't think we have ever had a waitress who even pretended to like what she was doing or was happy to be there waiting on people.  She was rather unfriendly, verging on rude.  We felt very rushed to place our order.  We ordered sliders.  Three of the tiniest sliders on the planet.  Mine was prime rib slider...soggy on the bottom.  I visited the restroom while there...two of the three toilets in the ladies' room were clogged. The parking, don't get me started.  Overall, aside from relatively high prices when compared to other sports bars, the place seems to be suffering from lack of attention by management.",

Be warned, if you share it with your munchkin, it's spicy (even with the delicious chipotle sauce on the side.) A choice of sides includes sweet potato tater tots! To top it off, you can roast s'mores at your dinner table (always a hit with the kids!) But, the price point is a tad high.  Dinner for 3, including dessert & a couple drinks, will run up to $$$ pretty quick!",

The sliders needed special sauce as they were a little dry.  The wings were ok, but I think I will try something else if we go back.  The music was really LOUD, but I guess you have to expect that at a bar - so don't expect to have any dinner conversation.",

A few weeks ago that all changed when I found myself with a few extra hours on my hands. As I walked through the doors I was immediately greeted with a warm and inviting smile from who I later learned to be Vanessa. She just so happened to be walking by the front door bringing drinks to another guest and cheerfully said \"someone will be with you in just a moment\". The stars must have truly been aligned that night because as I was seated I was promptly greeted again by.. You guessed it; Vanessa. I have to say that I am one of those foodies that goes to a restaurant with a specific dish in mind to satisfy the current craving. Looking over the menu I was somewhat overwhelmed so enlisted the help of my waitress. She immediately rattled off something about peanut butter and jelly when I said \"say no more, I'll take it\". The burger was better than imagined and and if I'm being honest, has invaded my dreams on more than one occasion. I'll be back; but only if Vanessa is working.",

The Maker's and coke he got was weak, and he knows it was weak because he's a bartender and knows how it's supposed to taste.  Our server was pretty lousy. She didn't check on us after we started eating; she only checked to see if the food runner ran out the correct food. She also didn't refill our water because she was completely absent from the floor after our food was delivered. She was also too busy talking to a girl when she finally got back on the floor that she almost didn't notice our plates were cleared and we were waiting for our checks.  I'm a server and it astounds me how poor quality the service was. The only reason why I gave two stars instead of one is because my roommate and his girlfriend's food was decent.",

Even at Mastros, a $12 side of asparagus would at least be more than enough to feed two, and have some leftover...I give my reviews based on value...so you're gonna charge me $15 for a mediocre burger made with low-grade ingredients, then charge me an additional $2 to get tots instead of fries?! The only reason this place gets two stars, and not one, is because they have a great beer selection, awesome tvs, atmosphere, and very good waitstaff/bartenders...the one interaction I witnessed between management and a hostess, makes me realize, in retrospect, why this place is a big miss. This guy completely degraded the very nice hostess, because there was a very understandable misunderstanding between her and me.  I will be at Zipps, or any other sports bar in town when I want a beer and some bar food...Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers makes you feel like a bigger sucker than any casino or strip club!",

She took the cards and close our tabs pretty fast and I was Ok with that because I thought she would come back but she didn't even though we were still there for like another hour. I was there sitting and drinking my melted ice and waiting ANY of the waitress to come back or make eye contact so I could order dessert and another drink on a different tab, but none of them ever came even though we waved our arms and the thing is the girls weren't that busy. One was just talking and giggling with a group of guys at the bar, another was just taking care of 2 older guys in another table which I usually wouldn't mind if I could only had a chance to order what I wanted.",

    "text": "This place is not child friendly. When we arrived, we were told that the wait was 15 to 20 minutes. As there were people waiting, it seemed to make sense. However, my 19 month old child wanted to walk around while we waited. I could see at least 10 open tables that were cleared and waiting for customers. I told the hostess that there were plenty of open tables and she merely said that they were \"working\" on seating people and that there were many people ahead of us. I'm not clear what she was doing as nothing needed to be done other than seat the customers. After 10 minutes, we were finally seated at a raised booth. My friend also had a toddler. The hostess sat us without bringing or offering to bring high chairs or booster seats. I had to get them. The booth was so high that the kids could not sit in the high chairs and eat off the table. After struggling with them in booster seats, I found a booth that was slightly lower. The restaurant does not have any regular tables inside and only a handful outside. A busboy was kind enough to relocate us but it was still difficult to feed the kids sitting a foot below table level. One of the high chairs did not have a working strap. We ordered off the child menu for the kids. In comparison to other restaurants, the food portion was small. Our food was fine except my friend ordered a hamburger with no cheese or bacon but asked for tomatoes. They brought it with cheese and bacon and no tomatoes. It took 15 minutes before anyone asked us about our meal and it wasn't our waitress.",

    "text": "My sister and I decided to try Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers for lunch on Saturday.  We sat outside on the patio and the atmosphere outside the restaurant was enjoyable.  Unfortunately our experience turned awful. I ordered the Prime Rib Sliders for $12.00, which only includes the sliders, if you want fries or salad add an additional $5.00. Ok, so I ordered the salad also and a beer.  My sister and I waited and waited, finally I asked another waitress walking by, where was the beer we ordered.  The waitress went back inside and brought out our beer.  Well, I took a sip and it was lukewarm beer and was not even cold.  My sister complained and they brought her another beer which was chilled.  I did not want to make a fuss and drank my warm beer.  Then comes the food.  I had 3 biscuit size rolls with meat stuff inside for the Prime Rib Sliders; I thought, \"Geeze I spent $12.00  for this! My sister and I both ordered salads, which never came.  I told the waitress when she finally came over to cancel the salads because we did not receive them.  I took a few bites out of the sandwich and couldn't even chew the meat; it was fatty grizzle. I spit out onto my napkin.  My sister noticed something in my dish and told me I had a hair in my food. I proceed to pull out a long brown hair in the sandwich.  Ok, that was it for me! I called over the waitress and told her I can not eat this food and to take it back.  I advised I do not want to pay for this dish.  The waitress stated she would get the manager over, well we sat and waited, however no manager ever showed to our table.  The waitress very rudely puts down the bill and they had deducted the Prime Rib Slider as requested.  I paid for my beer and left... I will never ever return to that place.  The service was awful; the food terrible!! In addition, the staff is unfriendly, rude, and worst customer service skills I have ever encountered.  Boy do I miss Uncle Bears!!! I will travel to one off Ray Rd to enjoy a COLD beer and GOOD food.  This restaurant will not last long as I see others have had similar experiences...",

The first time I went we sat at the bar and had to flag a bartender down in order to get service.   THe food was mediocre... We had the buffalo chicken dip and it was rather acidic.  The 2nd time I went food was good... We had the cheeseburgers on the happy hour menu for $7.50.  I was disappointed in the beer because they advertised dos xx lager as on special and they were outso I had a domestic.  Don't order the large beer as its a rip off.  They say it's 19 oz but it's closer to 16 oz which is the same as a pint    We asked for no lemons in our water and it came w lemons, then our server brought out another beer and when she set it down she spilled it on my phone.  None of these things are major blunders, but they just make the place so so.",

But I was wrong the hostess immediately took us to a table and sat us. We were immediately greeted by our waitress. Things were looking up. But then we had to wait 15 minutes to order. My drink came to the table only partially made. The waitress was pleasant and immediately took care of correcting my drink. But then it took 45 minutes to get our food. We had 3 young girls ages ranging between 6 and 10, who became very agitated as they were hungry. But then the food arrived and two of us got the wrong orders. It was tasty just executed poorly. I probably will come back as I hope this was just an enigma of events. And I will be more than happy to change my review because I have high hopes for this place.",

The first time our server was rude, forgot about us and took 25 min to get our food, when we did it was cold. Last night we thought we would try again. The staff seemed preoccupied with other things they were not very attentive to our needs.",

The food is great!  The kids love the pretzels with cheese for a starter. There is something for everyone, even for my gluten free sister-in-law. Tonight we had two $12 beer buckets (6 beers /bartender's choice). Great deal!   My wife got the veggie burger off of their new healthy choice menu.  It was delicious! The chicken burgers and hamburgers are always fabulous.   Our server tonight, Andrea, went above and beyond to make sure our youngest son had a great b-day dinner.   Fast and friendly service tonight.   The s'mores are always a fun way to end the meal. We will be back in a month for the next bday.",

Our menu questions were answered and our food came out promptly and just as we had ordered. I had the reuben with coleslaw instead of sour kraut which was a surprising change that I liked.

I ordered the Juicy Lucy which was supposed to be stuffed with cheddar-Jack cheese. Not sure where the cheese or the Juicy part of the burger was. The bun was an oversized stale roll that was not even edible. My dad ordered the chili Mac hotdog and it was nothing more than a hotdog covered in hamburger helper. Eeek!!  As if the food wasn't bad enough the server was completely clueless on what the daily specials were and she probably could use some more training.   I will admit this is a much better restaurant than Uncle Bears was. They have a great beer selections and the new TVs they installed will be great for football season.   I'll try this location again and hopefully they will have worked out the kinks.",

We shared that, and then we also shared the MMMac and Cheeseburger. Yes, this is a burger with mac & cheese on it. It was equally as sublime as the dog. Also, we had beers that we chose from their selection of 100.   Just delightful....delightfully freaking good!",

The \"hostess\" then grabbed menus and took off without even looking at us.  She didn't ask if we had any preference, such as indoor/outdoor or table/booth.  We followed, she put the menus in a booth and walked away.  Not a great opening impression, but we were hungry.  I wasn't timing it, but it felt like a good 10 minutes before we finally had to flag down a random employee to say that we hadn't been helped yet.  A few minutes later, our server comes to take drink orders, and, since we had plenty of time to memorize the menu, we asked her to take our food orders, too.  The drinks and food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  After our food was delivered and everyone had left, though, we realized that there were no napkins or silverware on our table.  Again, we had to find a random employee to flag down and bring us some.  We all got burgers, and we were all satisfied, if not impressed, with the quality of the burgers.  In fact, the burgers are the only reason I added a 2nd star.  The only complaint I have about the food was the inedible amount of salt on the fries.  I love fries, but couldn't eat more than a few of these.  You can always add salt.  You can't remove it.  I live very close by, and am a fan of this franchise, so I want it to stick around.  These are easy problems to fix with a little training and accountability, so I hope they close the gaps.",

After 20 minutes they told us our table was ready, but they gave it away to someone else on accident and we had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. They didn't apologize or offer any complimentary or discounted items for our inconvenience. The flat screens had designated games they were supposed to play, but we missed the first part of the game because they didn't know how to work the TVs. Overall horrible experience and wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a good time and friendly service.",

Most restaurants like this just throw some terrible frozen POS that taste like cardboard on a bun and serve it up. To my delight this place makes a great non-meat patty in house that actually provides the experience of eating a big greasy burger. Yes, it's True that just because someone doesn't eat meat that they don't ever want the joy of eating some unhealthy grease bomb and washing it down with a few cold pints.   So thanks again Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers!  I will absolutely be back for another one of those veggie burgers.",

It's about time we gave them a try!  We decided to swing by for dinner before punishing our livers at a Halloween party.  The four of us ordered two orders of chicken strips, a bowl of onion rings, half an order of Original Tot Chos, and a Buddha's Delight Mmmac & Cheese to share.  The chicken strips and onion rings were basic but the Original Tot Chos and Buddha's Delight Mmmac & Cheese were BLISS!  Anything with a copious amount of cheese is more than okay with me.  If I didn't had such a filling lunch, I would have loved to try one of their \"award-winning cheeseburgers.\"  Guess I have to be back!  Despite two of us looking like zombies, service was excellent on this busy Saturday night.  They were friendly and attentive and the place was clean.  The boys let us know that there are televisions in the men's restroom so you never have to miss a moment of whatever game you were watching.  Nice.",

However, depending on which server you get that day, will determine what you are charged. After 5 visits, we always substitute cheese on menu yet now we are charged a fee for substituting the stated cheese. Really?? Then also bring me the cheese I paid for!  There is a drink special on Sat and Sun for mimosas with a $1 refill. Again, depending on which server you get you will either be charged $7 or $10 for your drink. ???? What???   Finally, the burgers.  Oh, the burgers. Out of a table of 6, FIVE of our burgers came out wrong!!! Yet we returned to give the local place another chance. Skip the chips, they are overlooked and burned most of the time.   Wait, can't forget management... Hmmm... Bring up an issue and one manager will shrug it off and another will comp you meal!! Ask for a specific game to be on the TV facing you and while you can clearly see the guys responsible for the remote chatting it up with the staff, and have asked your waitress 3X, twenty-five minutes later they will finally get around to stop chatting and accommodate you. Not the server's fault.   Conclusion: They need to work on training. BIG Time!!! They are definitely succeeding on location than out of service or quality of food. Unfortunately the \"newness\" of the place will wear out soon and the food and drinks will have to speak for themselves!  And in closing: Always place bar napkins when serving a wet dripping glass!!!!",

So, I realize that when you order a Turkey burger that there is a 60% chance it will suck...with that being said- thought I'd give it a try (I dunno why sometimes I'm a vegetarian, sometimes a cowatarian, sometimes a piscatarian or something like that). Anyway, I can't tell if I was impressed with the \"how\" or disgusted with a Turkey burger that came out tasting and texturing like a salmon patty.  I didn't know Turkey could be flaked. Enough ketchup fixes everything though. All of us were \"meh\" with the food and \"holy sh*&!\" With the bill. Server was great and courteous! However, one of the other waitress's came blazing through the dining area talking about the kitchen smelling like farts *one eyebrow raise*  soooo...I dunno what's going on there but it was said loud and proud so I'm just gonna send it off.",

There's nothing wrong with being average but I've tried 4 different burgers here and to me they were all below par.  The service is also just average. During our last visit with my kids there must have been no manager on duty because the waitresses were more interested in running back to hang out in the kitchen than looking after the customers. We had 1 refill on drinks the entire time from our waitress, but what really got my attention was the busboy who walked past our table 8 times and never once stopped to take dirty plates I had kindly stacked up or offer to refill any drinks. He was too busy flirting with one of the other staff members.  To sum it up, they have the word \"cheeseburgers\" in their name, but there are plenty of other restaurants I'd rather eat a burger at in Chandler. For beer and lots of TVs, it's a cool place to hang out. Not great for kids.",

Skip the pretzel, but save room for the tableside s'mores!  It's hard to do though because the burgers are huge, and wow are they tasty!  Two thumbs up.",

The beer selection is great any thing from a watered down ultra light to a citrus tasting amber kilt lifter and a dark roasted milk stout that's scrumptious and tasty.   I had the left hand brew milk stout and it was delicious as ever.  For dinner I had the pb&j burger. Bun was good, the burger bacon pb&j just amazing taste together .  Fries on the side.   Only thing I could complain about is I had to get off my chair to go get the ketchup and tobacco.   Great place and great ambiance.  Parking sucks tho",

I lease apartments in the area and hear nothing but good things about this place. I think they changed their name once before.  Anyhow, I gave them a shot and then I was hooked. I've tried this place twice already. They have a great menu! So many burgers to choose from, and an insane amount of different beer! Service can get a little crazy. So definitely \"get in line\" with their sweet phone app to save you some time. They have a crazy amount of the, so it's great for playoffs! They also advertise a mobile app to where you can hear the tv of you're choice from you're phone, which is a great idea. I couldn't get it to work, but hopefully that pulls through.   Service can get a little slow, but all the girls and staff seem great. The price isn't that crazy for the items I their menu too. So...if price, food quality, and service are great....that's enough to keep a customer coming.   If you like cold beer, and cheeseburgers (hence the name), you should definitely this place a shot.   Rylee, is the best server btw!",

They were good-I'm talking when you rip them in half the cheese follows good!    Main dish was the hot and smokey Mac and cheese! It was yummy- larger pasta noodles then the typical and the cheese sauce wasn't too runny where it was watery! Nice flavor from the spicy jalapeno! BF got the French dip- he said it was juicy and tender but I found it a bit salty with the au jus sauce.  Friend ordered the PB AND J burger and said it was delish!   Only down fall was service felt it was a bit slow for our server come back and check on us! I get it we're a big party but it wasn't very crowded.

We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, and we elected to sit at the bar, which is quite huge. When I say huge, I'm speaking a rectangular shaped bar with very long sides. The back side of the bar is actually outside, so the patrons on that side have their backs to the covered patio, which is also quite spacious. There are numerous TV's throughout  the venue, which is great for sports programs.  Once seated, we were immediately greeted by the bartender, who informed us of both the daily and happy hour specials, and had our drinks in front of us in no time. My wife and I both decided to get burgers and share a side of mac n cheese as an appetizer. The menu actually has several options for Mac n cheese.  I can tell you that the \"small\" portion we chose to share for $5 was actually quite generous, and very, very yummy!  The burgers were prepared perfectly to our request for medium well, and the 1/2 lb patties were quite large. Our bartender, Vanessa, was spot on, and checked back with us frequently. Her service was top notch, so kudos to her!  We will most certainly be back to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers soon, as our first impression couldn't have been any more positive.   Also, FYI, if you check in on your Yelp app, you will receive a 10% discount promotion for your first check in!",

    "text": "I wanted to like Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers and I did, but I wouldn't go back. My husband and I came here for dinner on Tuesday night and I enjoyed some of my meal but not all of it. It's a super bright sports bar which I'm not used to, lol, usually there tend to be a little dark inside but not CB&CB, the fluorescents were on 100 that night. My husband ordered the All American burger which is a standard cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, and pickle. It's an extra $2 to sub a different side if you don't want their house chips which my husband did and ordered fries. I ordered the Steakhouse Truffle burger because I felt fancy. It had gruyere, bacon, garlic aioli, white truffle oil, herb butter, baby greens, caramelized onion, and thyme roasted tomatoes. I don't know WHY when reading that it didn't register that that's A LOT on one burger, I just thought it sounded decadent. Well, it was A LOT. The aioli, the butter, and then the truffle oil, it all weighed down the burger tremendously and made it way too soggy and salty. Also, it smelled, lol. I mean it definitely smelled because of the garlic aioli but it was definitely an off-putting smell. I ate half my burger and tossed the rest. The house chips were really good but they were all cooked to different degrees of crispiness and they were all different temperatures as if they had given me some from a previous batch mixed in with a fresh one. My husband liked his burger but he's easy so there's that. Overall, I think it was definitely overpriced and just okay. The burgers were on par with Red Robin but slightly more expensive. Our waitress was super friendly and the service was attentive, it was also pretty packed for a Tuesday night so clearly other people love it but it's a polite yet firm \"no, thank you\" from me.",

The guy we talked to (later claimed to be the manager when I asked to speak to one) had an attitude from the beginning. Told us \"we won't even sit you until everyone is here\" and proceeded to ignore us. We waited until everyone arrived and asked again to be seated. This time he look annoyed and said \"I can only give you these two small tables\".  We said ok. He went off and did not return for 10 minutes. A bunch of us standing there and not sure what is going on. I asked to speak to a manager and he returned asking me what's the problem. At this time I asked him if he was having a bad day and took my crew to pizza place next door, where we had wonderful service immediately.  The issue with this place is not the wait, but the poor attitude of the manager and the staff that seem to be the culture there. I work for a large company near by and will make sure no one return here any time soon.",

There were FLYS EVERYWHERE!!!! Seriously! The whole meal, we were swatting flies away from our faces, our table, our meals, our drinks. It was really obnoxious. They has these big doors open to the patio area, with no one even out on the patio area. If you're gonna have the doors open, find a solution for the flies please. That is just gross.   For a place with cheeseburger in the name, the burger was downright bad. First of all, it came out cooked wrong. Supposed to be well done, came out not rare but RAW. Yuck.  The food took forever and I had the food that should have taken the longest. How did you manage to undercook it this bad??? By the time my burger came back, the rest of the family was done eating. No manager ever stopped by or touched our table. When the burger did make it's way out, it had clearly been squashed over the hottest area of the grill. It tasted burned and was HARD. The first bite was not that good but after it came back it was REALLY NOT GOOD. All in all, a HARD PASS ON THE BURGER PATTY.   As far as the dressings of the burger, it was the \"Mac n' Cheese burger (something like that). It was a gross patty on a plain bun, with their \"Homemade mac n' cheese\". The pasta was just that... pasta! It was dry, bordering on being crunchy. There was no cheese flavor, no cheese color. It didn't even smell like cheese. There was no additional slice of cheese on the burger... It was just plain sad. Some Kraft mac n' cheese would have done the trick but these guys tried to get fancy and it did not work out. I couldn't believe there was not a single condiment or dressing on this bun besides this pasta. Really poorly done.   The fries were passable. I wouldn't go back there for them but I had the regular and they were a 6/10. My husband had the sweet potato tater tots. Those were delicious. Definitely the brightest spot in this whole meal.  My mother in law had a salad that she really enjoyed and I wish I had gotten (I was in the mood for a cheeseburger!). My father in law had a club sandwich that also looked tasty.  I do think they have some decent food here but you have BURGER in your name... I wanted a BURGER!!! I feel like if you have the balls to put \"Cheeseburgers\" right in your name, you had better make a damn good one!!!!!!   Really disappointed!",

It is unnerving how terrible their customer service was. After that incident, the meal was ruined & an utter waste of money. I will NEVER be back. Too bad too, since my friends have all been talking about trying it. After our experience, I'm pretty sure they will skip this place.

The interestingly named Cinnamon Smith was our personable waitress and did a good job and did not live up to her stripper name!  So we decided to do beer flights of their local brews and to pimp our burgers.  My wife chose the lite flight, which consisted of Abita Purple Haze, Goose Island 312, Four Peaks Sunburn and Coronado Orange Wit.  I chose as always the local flight, which included Four Peaks Hop Not, Sleepy Dog Red Rover, San Tan Devils Ale and the best of all, Sonoran white chocolate ale (Yummmm!). For my burger I chose the Angus burger on an artisan roll, with all of my favorites, bleu cheese crumbles, bacon, jalapenos and barbecue sauce, accompanied by the most delicious sweet tater tots I had ever tasted.  My wife as always went the healthier route with a turkey burger with no bun, with guacamole, grilled Anaheim peppers,  Sauteed onions, tomato, lettuce, grilled chiles, mushrooms and Gruyere cheese, accompanied by her favorite, onion rings.  Lots of TVs all around and an extensive menu means we will be back!",

My husband and I have a theory that the best servers are promoted to bartenders, so bartenders are a reflection of the quality of service at a restaurant. I felt like we had to beg for attention every time we needed something (to order a beer or a glass of water or meal, get napkins, close out our tab, get a to go box). There were 4 bartenders plus a bar back on duty, even though they seemed busy they still had time to chat with regulars (after one week of being open? More like friends).  The highlight of our meal was the $5 pretzels with cheese dip (happy hour price). The mustard drummettes were good but not $11 good. Our two burgers with what seemed like unseasoned frozen crinkle cut french fries added up to $30, not worth the price whatsoever. My hubby had the prime burger, and the prime rib on top was meh and seemed like it was previously frozen as well.  We may go back for beer and appetizers someday when we are nearby and desperately thirsty, but that is about it.",

She didn't care enough to put forth the slightest effort.   Quality of Food It was terrible.  The tots were burned.  The fries weren't seasoned.  The burgers were overcooked and flavorless.  Some ingredients from standard menu items were missing.",

    "text": "Decided to check this place out for dinner.  This was our second attempt after a failed first attempt due to horrible parking (which forced us to make the choice to go somewhere else).  Initially, the vibe of the place put us on edge.  Not entirely sure why, we were just never that comfortable.  It's very dark, and waiters and waitresses are hustling everywhere.  I shouldn't complain too much, my burger was cooked the way I ordered.  That's about it though.  I had the 1000 island burger.  There was a minuscule amount of 1000 island dressing, most likely due to the gargantuan, dry bun sucking up every last drop of it.  It's one of those buns that the top is about 2\" thick and the burger is 3/4\".  If you are a burger person, this is not the place to go.  The prices are pretty high and the quality just isn't there (tater tots an additional $2 or else you get chips).  This is a definite \"one-and-done\" for us.  Was contacted by owner (as seen below) offering to make it right.  I appreciated that, and messaged her back.  Unfortunately, we aren't going back.",

The food was less than average and the service wasn't much better. I'm pretty sure that my girlfriend and I won't be returning anytime soon with all the other great places to go.",
