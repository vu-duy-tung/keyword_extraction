I picked it up without a hitch, and as I took my first bite, my taste buds soared into ecstatic oblivion and beyond.",

This one was AMAZING, I love the crust, so flaky and crunchy and the same time and the creaminess and sweet gooeyness of the filling, so decadent.  The second time, my husband go several holiday cookies and scones, I loved the salted caramel scone.  We also got a blueberry one and a raspberry.  The other day I got some more cookies, I couldn't get enough of the sandwich cookie, that has a cutout on the top one.  I had a peach cobbler one and and amaretto.  I think they are called jammies.  This was the second time I have ordered them, they are like a sugar cookie that is crunchy and firm with a filling.  Soooo good.",

A few weeks ago I ordered the grill cheese panini takeout.  I asked for only one type of cheese.  As per the description and price I was expecting a gourmet panini; what I got, was a greasy mess with nothing but bread, cheese and butter or lard (who knows).  It was so disgusting, I threw it out.   Earlier this week I gave them another go and ordered a couple of scones for breakfast; what I got was two tiny, soggy, greasy things that did not resembled a scone.  It is so disappointing but I will skip this place in the future.  2 stars because the staff is incredibly nice.",

Cute decor, a nice little patio area, and a wonderful variety of baked goodies make this place worth finding and visiting. But go early, as the pies sell out amazingly fast. We savored the Mac n Cheese with Pulled Pork and coleslaw. Both were really yummy! Wanted pie for dessert, but they were sold out. Opted for cookies instead. To.die.for. The sandwich cookies were perfectly baked and packed with interesting flavors. Kind of glad the pie was sold out. The only hiccup in the whole experience was that the wait time seemed a bit long (about 40 minutes). It would have been nice for the waitstaff to have kept us updated on the progress of our food, but the server disappeared after taking our order and didn't reappear until our food arrived. This was our first time visiting, so perhaps this was unusual. Still, regular check-ins would have been nice. But DO NOT let this in any way stop you from giving them a try. You will be SO GLAD you did. ***Update*** Gave my feedback to the management, who responded right away.  He let me know that they were down a waitperson and a chef that day, hence the long wait and lack of information. We will definitely be going back to SugarJam to eat their baked deliciousness and update our report on the service issues.",

First of all, if you've never had sweet potato pie, it's 100000x better than pumpkin pie! You will never want pumpkin pie again after tasting sweet potato pie. And THIS sweet potato pie is the sweet potato pie to end all sweet potato pies!  I couldn't help myself, I had to try it before the turkey was done and WOW.  It's perfect.  The spices are perfect.  The crust is phenomenal.  The consistency is perfect.  I can't say enough about the high quality of this pie! Several guests had never had sweet potato pie and when they tried it, they agreed, as they always do, that it puts pumpkin pie to shame.  I'm beyond impressed.  I cannot wait to try their other baked goods and let me tell you, I know where I'm getting my birthday cake in February!",

We watched tabes of 4+ get their plates one at a time...sometimes 10 minutes between plates. The food was good - their sausage gravy was outstanding.

    "text": "We decided to try something new for lunch on a Saturday so of course I checked my Yelp bookmarks and Sugar Jam was it today. This is a hidden gem tucked away in a business park.   We walked in and very interesting. Small little place with the counter and the bakery goods to temp you right away. Their menu is on a chalk board behind the counter. So what you do is order and pay. Find a table and they bring you your food. Little interesting, after we found our table they give brought a table mat and drinks. Your silver ware and napkins are already at the table.   So when it came time to order, I already knew what I wanted and ordered The Boss Hog. This was a six inch long sandwich with pulled pork, chopped brisket with homemade slaw and BBQ sauce on top. It came with a side of potato salad and potato chips. Oh my gosh. This was so good. Loved the sandwich. It just came together with the slaw in top and the BBQ sauce. Wasn't dry at all. Really tasty and fresh. As you can tell I enjoyed this a lot. The potato salad was so good too. Really enjoyed this meal. It hit the spot.   The owners dad served us and he was so friendly. He really made our visit special. Very happy man. He brought out another BBQ sauce called the mojo. Really good. Nice kick to it. You got to try this mojo sauce. He also gave me a sample of their homemade cowboy beans. Made me think twice about the potato salad. So I don't think you can go wrong in picking the potato salad or the cowboy bean. Both are excellent.   My wife and daughter ordered the chicken walnut & cranberry salad on a croissant. First thing my daughter said was oh my gosh. The croissant was so fresh and I snuck a bit and it was so good. Down right good. They all loved it. They even split the sandwich on separate plates with their side. Really good. The owners dad gave both my daughter and wife samples of both their pulled pork and chopped brisket. They love it too. That BBQ sauce really makes it really good. Sweet and spicy. Nice.   To top off our meal, we got a personal raspberry pie and a apple pie. A la mode. Perfect size to share. We all like the raspberry the best but they were both really good. We liked the food so much here that we bought a cherry crumb pie to go. Looked so good and I'm always a sucker for cherry pie. I have to admit it was good. Very good.   So service was great. Not busy at all. There was another table but nice and quiet. The owners dad was so friendly and just loves to talk to you. It felt like you're at home eatin a homemade meal. I really loved this place and looking forward to trying the rest of their menu. They have breakfast too. Enjoy",

I have been searching forever for biscuits & gravy like my mom used to make and the ones served here are as close as you could get! I requested more gravy than what was initially provided (as suggested by the couple seated behind us) and it was served at no extra cost.   They said they started as a food truck and then moved into having a restaurant. It's small, but clean, bright, cheery and clean. Hard to find, but worth the hunt.   *It should be noted that they close at 1:30 on Sundays. Not sure why they made that decision as it's a little hard to get there in time  from where we live in north Phoenix following church service.  They close at 3:00 on other days. Closed all day Monday.   The cook is the wife of the couple that own and run  it and the husband is the friendly dude that takes the orders and does everything else. He said she's \"Sugar\" and he's \"Jam\". How cute is that?!!  We will be returning and bringing friends.",

Such a nice change of pace and everything I tried from the bacon to the ham and the to die for waffles with some butter, compote, and whip cream was top notch without the normal uptight feel of places that try to offer similar experiences. Music playing in the background was at a nice volume. The desserts looked incredible...I chose a Mexican chocolate cookie sandwich which had a light spicy flavor to it, not the over bearing taste of cayenne like you find in other Mexican chocolates. The staff was on top of their stuff and definitely have a love for quality and an easy going lifestyle.  The local organic coffee was a nice roast that seemed to be brewed at the correct temperature and retained a nice citrus taste and good mouth feel.  There was even a baby shower occurring while I was there and I can see why from the lovely decor and great brunch food.  This is a place where the food will bring a smile to your face with each bite.  Love, Love, Love This will be a stop for me every time I am in the Phoenix area.",

My friend got a side of the potato salad with her sliders and after tasting them I nearly are the rest off of her plate!!! I had the cowboy beans with my meal and they tasted absolutely AMAZING. By the end we were stuffed but we just had to take home one of the cute personal cherry pies and later that night we devoured it! I do not,think,i have ever tasted a cherry pie like this, it was absolutely breathtaking! I am already planning on getting pies here for the holiday season! Overall the food was outstanding,sweets were to die for, the service was excellent and the decor was super cute! I will DEFINITELY be back again and share this adorable hidden treasure with everyone. If you are looking for an all around great experience this is the number one place to,go!!!",

Service: Dana(owner I believe) and Sophie were both friendly and easy to talk to.  Explained everything and any question I had in detail.    Food: Honestly, very tasty.  I ordered a Black Forest ham, egg, and cheese croissant that was delicious-buttery, savory.  Also ordered 3 cookies-2 sea salt chocolate chip toffee and one chocolate chip.  Just ate a sea salt toffee.  My intention was to have one bite.  Intention turned into eating the whole cookie in a matter of minutes.  Guilty pleasure: 1  Intention: 0",

Greeted by Luke (awesome guy) who found it very difficult to select one of the items on this exceptional menu to recommend because Everything was truly that delicious ...I say this because once I made my selection of the croissant homemade chicken salad with walnuts and raspberries (to die for)! He graciously greeted me with tasters of there home made rubbed briskets,pulled pork & sauces samples. YumYum!! Crazy delicious! In addition I couldn't leave without taking with me a cookie a home-baked caramel chocolate chip cookie ...Wow no words!!!  :-)) Super cute Decour, very clean and absolutely a must stop by!!! Must be a big hit by many ...because the owner who spend some time chatting with me (very delightful) is very excited to announce her expansion! Enjoy all the culinary delights Sugar Jam has to offer!!! Tip-The owner said that there is a specialty that she cooks only on Saturdays... it's a French toast culinary delight. I'm headed back for sure!!! Enjoy",

Such great flavor.  But the waffle. Oh the waffle. Heaven. I don't typically order waffles but since this was customer favorite I decided to go for it. I am not disappointed. The waffle was fall flavored and came with flavored butter and whipped cream. This was our first visit and we are already planning our next. My compliments to the chef!",

    "text": "After reading the Yelp reviews and co-workers feedback, I was so excited to try Sugar Jam... and I had very high expectations. Unfortunately, they were not met.  We went on a Wednesday and chose their Italian special of a mozzarella/provolone and tomato grilled cheese sandwich with a cup of \"tomato basil bisque.\" After waiting about 15-20 minutes to get our food, I was expecting the best grilled cheese of all time. It was just okay. I've had similar, but much better grilled cheese sandwiches, at food trucks. And the \"bisque\" seemed more like marinara sauce from a jar. I and my friend used it for dipping our sandwiches, because it was way too strong to eat straight. The sandwich, \"bisque\" and an iced tea (with tip) came out to over $12. Honestly, not worth it (and I'm not someone who cares about the cost if it's good).  I also bought a chocolate cupcake and chocolate chip cookie for the road (over $5 in total). The cupcake was good, but the frosting wasn't as sweet as I like, so if you like Sprinkles frosting, Sugar Jam will not be your thing. The cookie was average as well.  Overall, this was not the experience I was hoping for. Perhaps I had it built up too much? Disappointing nonetheless.",

    "text": "Everyone knows breakfast and brunch is my thing.... so when I had another opportunity to visit this Sugar Jam. I was on it!   As you walk in this place its so adorable. It takes you back to a side street cafe in Italy.  There signature colors are yellow and black which makes the decor pleasing to the eyes.    We were seated quickly and a sweet lady with a patriotic shirt and hair bow greeted us at the table. Her smile was genuine and warm. She handed us the menu and rattled off the special.    The menu was straight and to the point, nothing bulky and repetitive.    A buttoned up chief's coat gentleman greeted us and asked us what we would like to order.  Starving,  I ordered the veggie omelet and my hubby ordered the all american with apple chicken sausage.  I'm ready to eat...... the brunch came out in less than 10 mins. Perfect for me because my stomach starting  talking to growling.  The omelet looked amazing now let's try it.  ...WOWwwww!   My hubby leaned over to me and said \"taste that\" he placed an apple chicken ausage on my plate.  Fork to mouth and it happened...WTF GOODNESS!   The omelet was perfection... Listen it is very difficult to make a good omelet but to make a perfect omelet with the right amount of cheese, peppers and onions.  That's a genius.    The apple chicken sausage was so moist I didn't realized I finished it.  The amount of food that you receive can keep you full all day long.    The raspberry jam was off the chain good.  I dunked my toast in it and was plateaued into space. Can I bottle this raspberry jam or what?   Breakfast and brunch are the most important meals of the day. Some people only eat once, so if your that person. You better go straight to Sugar Jam....   The Sunday brunch gave me LIFE.... I'll be there again very soon!",

Lucky me. Service is great!!! Waffle is best I have had anywhere ever. Eggs appear to be poured from a bottle or ?  I want my egg to be an obvious egg! This...hard to say. Thin sliced ham..kinda same. Just ok.  So it seems quite different here than my previous. And maybe explains why I'm still the only customer here.  So I'm dinging them pretty deep because only the waffle was excellent.  New customers entering now however.",

I ordered a coffee and had to ask for cream. My husband had to go in search of a spoon for me. I had to grab a basket of napkins and cutlery, which was devoid of spoons. No waters were brought out, which is fine as we don't like wasting water in the desert. I ordered the savory waffle meal and an entirely different meal was brought out for me. Basically, I watched my husband eat, after which the meal I ordered came out. (See the before and after pics attached.) My waffle was not fully cooked through so I ate the bacon, some of the eggs and some of the sausage gravy, which was very good.",

I think they have something great going on with the pies and cookies. Unique flavors and delicious!   However, I didn't have the greatest customer service on Father's Day yesterday. We made a reservation in the morning. When we got there on time, our table was not ready. So a waiter wiped it down shortly. He didn't do the best job cleaning, as we had to get napkins ourselves and clean off some spilled sugar on the table. Our basket at the table did not have any napkins, nor did our waiter refill it, so we grabbed some from another table. I later asked our waiter to see a list of their pies; he said he would bring me a to-go menu. I never did see him back at our table, not even with the to-go menu.   We waited an hour for our food. Not sure what took so long, no one even checked up on us to let us know it will take long. I went to the cash register and reminded them about our food to see what was taking so long. Five minutes later, our food is brought out. Not even at an apology for the wait. My dad was not too happy about this and he said he would not return.   I am leaving this review so the restaurant can see and make improvements so customers don't leave unhappy.",

First: The charge to our credit card we actually used the card three times, because our group didn't arrive all at once), as reported by the bank, matched neither the pre-tip ammount nor the post-tip ammount. On any of the three charges. It was close, and maybe less in aggregate, than what we thought it should be, but, still, it was odd.   Second: The pie was expensive. It was good, but for your regular friends, just get them Polly's Pies or Maria Callendars. Maybe only get this for someone who you really want to get into bed or something.   Third: My mom, when she really doesn't like something, adds \"that\" to the noun, as in \"Steve Garvey's wife ran off with _that_ Marvin Hamlisch.\" Well, she said \"They put _that_ clove in their pies.\" I liked the odd flavor the clove imparted, but just be warned: they put that clove in some of their baked goods.   Overall, great lunch place and beautiful and delicious baked stuff.   None of this review is meant, in any way, to let Cyndy Garvey off the hook for cheating on Steve. Bad, BAD girl!",

But in order to promote the family and their restaurant I give this place five stars for the good service and the great recipes especially the French toast. Over the months that we've gone they seem to have a rotating staff and turnover which is not necessarily a bad thing. Service can vary depending on who you get that day but the husband and wife owners have treated as kindly and sometimes go out of their way to say hi and go above and beyond for service. This place can get crowded due to its small footprint floor plan so get here early if you have a small group. This place is not obvious driving by unless they have a person with a sign directing you, but those who know, know and become the regulars. They somewhat specialize in barbecue and the dishes are available for breakfast with BBQ which is an interesting combination. All kinds of sweets are available including pies cakes and cookies and they offer whole pies to go especially in advance of holidays where you can pre-order your pie. You should go to this place but just don't tell anyone keep it a secret.",

    "text": "SugarJam is that rare (almost unique) combination of a bakery and a BBQ spot.  It is located in a small office complex space, and is really barely big enough to be either.  The result is that the excellent food is somewhat compromised by the non-existent ambiance and the very small selection.   For example, for lunch, you basically have sliced turkey, bbq chopped brisket, or bbq pulled pork.  Now both the brisket and pork were great, the beans exemplary, and even the bread far above average, but I wish they gave me more choices so I could come back a few times -- maybe sliced brisket, bbq chicken or salmon, etc.  Similarly there are only a few bakery selections and only a very few of each.  If someone comes in before you and orders peach pie you are out of luck.  I wish SugarJam the best of fortune and hope they grow into what they can be.",

He told me all about the different cookies and baked goods they have to offer. He even gave me the run down on the savory foods they offer.  I chose two jam-filled cookies(lemon raspberry and almond amaretto), which is how they got their start, and a caramel toffee cookie. All three were good, but not necessarily exceptional or unique. The jam cookies were a little on the hard side.  The cookies were good, however I was in sticker shock when I went to pay. $7.29 for three cookies? Sorry, I can't justify paying that much for cookies.",

After getting the run around from another bakery, my fiance spent his entire day calling bakeries trying to see if someone would be able to help us out since we were put in a such a bind; our wedding was less than 2 weeks away.   After he called Sugar Jam, Dana didn't hesitate to step in and help us, and I couldn't be more appreciative or thankful. She made the process so easy, and was open to having us send her pictures of what kind of cake we were imagining, as well as customize each tier with different flavors and buttercream. I was going to pick up the cake myself on the day of the wedding so I could tell everyone in person how appreciative I was, but I got caught up at the salon and had to send my two bridesmaids. They sent me a snapshot of the cake and I was floored, it was beautiful!!! I couldn't have imagined it turning out any better, and I received compliments all night about how great the cake looked. But once we got past the looks and it came time for eating, we were just as thrilled. The cake was delicious and it was absolutely everything we asked for.   So Dana, thank you and your staff so much for having giant hearts and fitting in our wedding cake when it was starting to look hopeless for us. The stress of it all was so worth it because it led us to you, and I can't wait to continue using your bake shop in the future, and will refer anyone and everyone I know. Thank you again!",

Nice cafe with warm design.   I started my lunch with the boss hog as I couldn't decided between pulled pork and brisket. I wanted have both! BBQ sauce was so good, I didn't know until later but they sell this BBQ sauce here. I have to make sure to remember to buy one next time. I really liked that green Apple inside, added unique texture to the meal, enjoyed every bite. For the side, I had Mac and cheese. Homemade and very tasty, nicely complimented the BBQ. They had other side dishes and all sounded good. I guess I need to come back here soon.  Since I really liked the bread served with sandwich, I had to try their baked dessert. Bread for sandwich had slight sweetness to it, I bed their cake will taste good too.  So for my dessert, I tried their apple pie. Just came out of the oven! One of the best apple pie I ever had. It wasn't overly sweet, just right amount of sweetness to it, I had to ask the staff about it. She said they use brown sugar.   Can't wait to come back again",

My first experience was stellar however every visit after this one has been inconsistent and unimpressive.    Bakery items - 5 stars - delicious sweet treats!   Service - 1 star - they always seem disorganized, not sure what's on the menu, half asleep and ignore you until it's time to bring you the bill.  You have to track them down just for a refill.  Needless to say they are not very attentive which strikes me as odd since this restaurant is so small.   Breakfast 2 stars - The first few times I ordered the bacon and thought it was the bomb!  Never had anything like it.  However, the last 2 times their food was inconsistent and I received burnt bacon that was so hard I can't believe they even served it.    I'm so disappointed and really hope they make improvements to their service and breakfast food quality.    Their baked goods are fantastic but stay away from their breakfast.",

Was this some lucid dream of mine....hmmm I ride it out... Brisket was pretty good.  Cole slaw was good.  And mac n cheese was cheesey.  I especially liked the the prompt service, refilled tea like 3 times.    The sweets look great.  Will be back.  As I sit here I was looking for the downside.  Other than being in an odd location I have nothing negative to say... I mean even the music selection was good.    Before I go... I want to tell you again... the sweets look great!!   Cute place, bring a friend, your mom, kid etc.  Enjoy!",

We continued to wait and no one acknowledged we were there. Unfortunately this is not our jam and we won't be back.",

The all American plate ($9.95): 2 scrambled eggs, 2 applewood smoked bacon, sauteed potatoes, 2 slices of toast (wheat, sourdough or Texas toast) served with butter and fresh jam. My egg was fluffy and my bacon was crispy. The almond amaretto jam was good.   Big bacon, egg and cheese croissant ($6.59): fluffy butter croissant layered with 2 eggs, applewood smoked bacon and cheddar cheese. The croissant was big and delicious.   Coffee ($3.75): organic local roasted coffee. The coffee was pretty good.   Our waitress, Sabrina was amazing. The owner was super cool too. She invited us to come back again for brunch, but unfortunately our schedule was fully packed.   4 stars!!  Sugar Jam Bake Shop & Bistro is yummylicious!!",

Quaint, feels like a little bistro. I didn't have time for a meal, but can't wait to bring my family back for breakfast. They've got their bakery goods on display by the front counter though, so I got some funfetti cupcakes (9 year olds love them!) and a peanut butter and jelly cream sandwich cookie. You guys. I would go back just for another one of those! The coffee was good too.  The main reason for this post though is to express how nice the staff is. Can I say sweet as pie? Too much? They were busy taking an order for a wedding cake and serving tables, but the gentleman behind the counter still took the time to explain the menu, how they make their own BBQ, and answer my questions.",

Can I say Dana the Owner makes the BEST CHERRY pie in town. She is super sweet! Nice to have recognition when you come into a shop. The crust is light and flaky with a touch of sweetness. I could eat the crust all day! Not too mention I had a great lunch today at her shop. Bbq applewood smoked pulled pork on a panini brioche bun with slaw and potato salad on the side. The BBq sauce is Awesome! Ok I am Superful!   But tonight is my cherry pie night! Can't wait.....Cookies I will have tomorrow. I will be ordering a pie and cake for Thanksgiving too.

The Snickerdoodle went really fast too.

It was a little hard to spot as it is in an unusual area, in a somewhat industrial looking building, kind of hidden. Well, when we first walked in, I couldn't  help but notice the adorable and quirky decor and the beautiful pastries on display! We were soon greeted by our awesome server. Unfortunately , I didn't catch her name, but she was friendly, energetic and just cool! She offered up some suggestions and we went with them. But first, she brought out a fantastic cup of coffee. I went with the apple chicken sausage, scrambled eggs, and waffle. My husband had the pulled pork hash. The chicken sausage was crisp, juicy and delicious. The eggs were perfect and the waffle was awesome! I don't care for the taste of nutmeg because I think it's a bit overpowering, so when I had my first bite of the waffle, I was kind of thrown...but by the second bite, I couldn't stop eating! Served with fresh strawberries and fresh whipped cream...So good. My husband loved his pulled pork hash and ended up buying a bottle of their mojo sauce because it was so good. The owner of the place came out to check on us and chat, and she was so nice and genuine. You could just tell that she has a passion and love for what she is doing. Then the chef came out to check on us and see if we were enjoying our meal. She too, was so genuine! Wow! Amazing service! This is the type of business you just want to see do well because it is so well deserved! If you are in the area, I highly recommend going to Sugar Jam!",

We haven't had breakfast there, although we may be going tomorrow morning. But that smells phenomenal when you're in there.

    "text": "So often you read mentions of local \"hidden gems\" on Yelp. What to do then when you actually find a hidden gem? A gem that really is local and hidden. Literally! My solution? Recognize one's limitations as a reviewer and embrace the clique! Did I mention Sugar Jam Bake Shop is a hidden gem?  IT'S HIDDEN: I've driven by Sugar Jam Bake Shop dozens of times and never knew it was there. Only a booth at a street fair and a follow up investigation on Yelp led to this lunch visit. Sugar Jam is located in an aging office building near the Scottsdale airport (NW corner of Hayden & Redfield Roads). No real signage on Redfield Road other than temporary placards placed outside to try to attract your attention. Parking is in the rear. Enter through a shaded courtyard. Once inside? Charming. Charming. Charming.  IT'S A GEM: Dana, the owner, greeted us at the counter as we came in on this day and then later came over to check up on us and chat. Nice. This gave us a chance to ask about the upcoming (10/1/2015) change in lunch menu. Fear not. Dana's baked goods will remain untouched, but she's bringing in \"Phil the Grill\", a \"Pitmaster Chef\", as \"seen on Chopped\", to enhance lunch offerings with pulled pork mac and cheese and the like. Sounds promising, particularly in light of how good the menu already is.   Our lunch items, a turkey Panini and a mac and cheese with salad, were both great. Don't know though if they'll make the cut for the new menu. You can order bagged lunches to go if you like. We, however, dined in. It's just too cute a spot for us not to. Seating is limited. Some folks were settled in studying for school and reading newspapers while sipping from oversized coffee cups. Regarding dessert, every baked good we have tried has been fantastic. The namesake sugar jam cookies were a delight at the street fair. I was expecting a petrified jam-like substance adhered to stale sugar cookies. Instead, the jam was fresh and the cookies soft. Delightful. We had some again today. Small fruit pies were also flakey and flavorful. Not too sweet. Not too tart. Perfect. I'm anxious to try other pies, like the pecan sweet potato. I'm just going to have to return to Sugar Jam again and again and again until I've sampled the entire baked good menu. A sacrifice I know.  Sugar Jam does bake in quantity for special events. A multi pack of a specialty chocolate mousse, making me rethink the concept of a twelve pack, was being readied for pick up as we were leaving. Dana showed it to us when she overheard us expressing interest. I would have liked an invite to that party.   IT'S LOCAL: Sugar Jam is the very definition of a small local business deserving of local support. Hours are limited, open only M-F 8:30 a.m.- 2:00 p.m. as of this date, but I suspect they might expand hours with the change in season and/or menu. I hope so. I've now sampled Sugar Jam twice. Met the owner Dana twice. Met the owner's husband once. Know a bit about their kids. Feel a little like I know them, or at least know them well enough to want to support their endeavor. Planning on becoming a regular. You should too. If you can find this hidden gem!",

It was pi day, so I was there for the obvious reason, but understanding there was BBQ to be had, I made it a whole lunch thing. Now, it's not a \"BBQ joint\", so don't think my expectations were too high, but the chopped hickory smoked brisket and apple slaw sandwich was exceptionally good, and certainly puts Sugar Jam high up on the list when that particular craving hits.  Being pi day, the pie supply halfway through the day was ebbing, so I got my request in for a fresh cherry pie, and it went in the oven while I had my sandwich and an excellent bottled root beer (Brownie Caramel Cream, which I am further indebted to Sugar Jam for the introduction). With the exception of people who don't like cherries (I'm not mad at you, but I don't understand you, and we probably can't be friends) I cannot imagine a person on earth who wouldn't consider committing a felony to experience that level of pleasure and satisfaction. The fact that you don't have to is testament to the service the Sugar Jam bake shop provides to humanity, which I am looking forward to supporting as much as possible on future visits.",

They are served on a toasted brioche bun that is delicious. The meat is piled high and has the best barbecue sauce that, like everything sold here, is homemade.   Locally owned and operated, Sugar Jam is only open for breakfast and lunch. The cowboy beans and mac n' cheese are to die for. Make sure you get some cookies on the way out, they are tremendous!

Food is okay, I ordered the French toast which was 2 large pieces of bread with a great tasting maple syrup. It comes with scrambled eggs; those I could have done without but they were plain and I was hungry so they got eaten. My Mother got a waffle which she enjoyed with extra whipped cream. My husband had 2 fried eggs and bacon but thought the bacon was too greasy. Several of us thought the coffee was bitter so it needed doctored up with cream and sugar.  Now for the bad - Service was slow; very slow.  After we placed out orders we sat with empty coffee cups and no water. I got up and asked another server if we could get more coffee and some water and she returned with a bottle of water and no glasses. She was surprised we had no glasses and said she would return and then went to another table so we still didn't get glasses for what seemed like another 10 minutes. Once the food came out the server didn't notice that my mother never got her waffle so we had to ask for it and of course there was another delay.  We had asked that my mother not get syrup but another helping of whipped cream instead but she got maple syrup, so more delay. One thing I can say about the service is that they didn't rush us out so we were able to sit and talk for a couple of hours but it took almost an hour to get our food. Maybe they were really short staffed. Sad because this place has potential.",

Met the owners who were very friendly and very engaging about sharing information about SJBS and the wonderful menu items. The place is very clean and has a homely feel about it.  The food is off the chain!!!! And get's a yesssss mister!!!! I had the biscuits and gravy meal with bbq brisket with a side of eggs, potatoes, and a waffle. Yes team, as I write this post 4hrs later, I am still full from breakfast .The waffle is something special. My son had toast this is in the same category as the waffle dayum! SJBS is going to be one of those restaurants in the near future where it will hard to get into. Sugar Jam is well worth the hr. drive from the SE valley to eat a great breakfast. The shrimp and grits is a specialty item.....Dana! You need to add the shrimp and grits to the rotation AWESOME! Be sure to hit the bakery up while you there as well, we picked up a small pecan pie treat for good measure.   The right price, the right place, and the right atmosphere.   Looking forward to going back soon.",

Wading thru the tons of options for delivery, I came across Sugar Jam and paused a bit. Feeling a huge need for chocolate, I ordered several cupcakes. When I opened the box of stunning cupcakes, the heavenly smell of rich chocolate wafts over me. I observed a moment of silent respect.   Do I actually TRUST that this little delicacy might taste like it smelled?! I gave in, sucking slowly on the divine little caramel ball atop the gorgeous cupcake. As I slowly unwrapped the cupcake, the avid chef in me notices how the muffin paper pulled nicely away from the cake itself.  I opened wide and allowed my mouth to completely envelop half the cupcake and frosting... it melted onto my tongue, as each taste bud sat up and sang his little heart out! I nearly lost consciousness. Seriously.   I reexamined the cupcake, thinking they HAD to have put some sort of voodoo on that little cake to make it so sublime... it was just a beautifully made treat. The caramel frosting coats the tongue in an intimate way, while the perfectly and incandescently moist chocolate cake nudges you to just this side of utopia.  I am making my first stop to the bakery itself tomorrow morning, uncertain of the effects on my figure, but frankly not enough to give a damn. I shall have my cupcake and then some from no other than Sugar Jam Bakery from this day forward! Stay away. I've staked my claim to the lot.",

    "text": "If the folks that own and work at Sugar Jam Bake Shop & Bistro weren't so incredibly warm and friendly, I would probably just keep this place my own little secret ...  ... I can't say enough good things about Sugar and Jam. It's located in a quiet office park yet conveniently 1 minute by car from the corner of Scottsdale Road and Thunderbird. And plenty of parking.   Everything - yes everything - is made fresh in their own kitchen. The creativity, flavor and generosity of their meals are noteworthy. BBQ fan? This is the place. Baked goods fan? This is the place. Indulgent breakfast and brunch? This is the place. And the coffee! And they are a real bakery too!  My group of 10 friends and I found this place (thank you YELP!) recently when we didn't feel like waiting for a table at the insanely busy HASH Kitchen. What a lucky break for us! We were seated right away, spoiled rotten by the staff, and on cloud nine with the creativity and taste of the indulgent breakfasts. And I'll say it again...that coffee!  So impressed were we all that within the past two weeks we all have been back at least once. With each other, with our wives, with other friends...  Don't let the obscure office park location throw you...walk through the doors or sit on the patio and you will be won over by the charming decor and the quiet, romantic ambience. They are kid friendly as well, my wife and I have now been here with our baby twice. This would be an awesome place to surprise that special someone and spend a leisurely romantic morning together. My wife and I really are enjoying our dates here.  I just read today that Matt's Big Breakfast will open a location at Scottsdale Road and Thunderbird soon. That's cool, it's good food. But if waiting in line at places like Matt's and Hash Kitchen isn't your thing, take the short 1 minute drive over to Sugar Jam Bakery and Cafe. Those other places definitely have a \"scene\" and good food, but  this is a great alternative to consider especially if you like things quiet, romantic, delicious, and want to linger.  Bravo Owner's Brian and Dana!  p.s. I noticed that a very small handful of yelpers mentioned waiting too long for their food. That has not been our experience. If you want \"fast food\", there are Egg McMuffins all over town (and heck they aren't half bad). This, however, is made to order, home cooked food in a quaint restaurant atmosphere. It's like being invited to someone's home. Expectations about time should be realistic. If you are expecting to be in and out in 15 minutes this isn't your place. If you are there for amazing food and hospitality - and a real meal - you won't be disappointed at all.",

    "text": "The saddest part of this experience was that I had this restaurant bookmarked for a year & was so excited to try it based on the stealer reviews. To say I was disappointed is a huge understatement. I'll list all the problems with this restaurant & recap of one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had. I am from AZ and support local small businesses as much as I can. There are a TON of amazing local restaurants in Scottsdale, DO NOT waste your money here.   1) I'm sure the young man who served us is a good person, he's simple not a good fit for the position, not personable, attentive or even aware (i.e. brought us butter & jam for toast we didn't order & served us potatoes when we explicitly subbed them out).   2) there was only 1 table ahead of us and our food took over 40 minutes. The other table was complaining about the wait as well   3) the staff started fighting and arguing loudly in the kitchen, we could hear everything, SO unprofessional.   4) we finally get our food, very underwhelming, smallest omelette ever and COLD. I ordered the veggie, only had spinach inside and wasn't even cooked, cheese wasn't melted but the eggs were overcooked, it's hard to cook that bad. My husband ordered the bacon, it had tiny pieces of bacon and small amount of cheese, his was smaller than mine. Their menu says \"fluffy\" eggs, I couldn't think of a more opposite description of this horrible food.   5) I informed our server of all of this. I would not leave a review without giving the business an opportunity to make it right. They didn't. He said \"sorry\". I'm not sure who's writing all these outstanding reviews but they're VERY misleading. If you dare go, proceed with caution.",

Personally, I have never had the pleasure of visiting a 5 star restaurant .  I read the reviews and saw the pics and quickly wazed our way there!    Upon walking into Sugar Jam, I immediately liked the atmosphere.  Decor was very eclectic and interesting.  The menu was not too large, but we still had difficult making our choices - everything was so tempting.  Upon speaking with our waiter, he mentioned the biscuits and gravy dish - which we had never tried.  We ordered one for the table to share - and it was absolutely delicious!!!  All our meals were phenomenal.  We were visited by both the chef and the owner during our lunch which made our experience that much more delightful!   They gave us a sample of their sea salt caramel cookies and we were hooked.  Obviously, we left with a variety of goodies to have for later!!  So glad our son is attending ASU so we will have the opportunity to go back !!  Definitely worthy of a 5 star rating!",

    "text": "Gimme more MOJO SAUCE!! This adorable and very friendly shop hits a home run with their pull pork sandwich. I love everything about this sandwich. The bun is perfect. I had a side of slaw. The slaw had a little sweetness that I really liked. I wish I would have ordered a side of Cowboy Beans, next time. I was greeted and treated extremely well. The BBQ chef came over and chatted with me. Such a nice man. He makes all the sauces from scratch and those sauces ROCK!!  I brought home a coconut cream pie and it is delicious. The crust didn't hold together but it is yummy.  I can't wait to take my hubby the BBQ fanatic. I know he will try the brisket.  The BBQ chef offered samples of the cowboy beans and the brisket but I assured him I will be back with the hubby.",

Or maybe you just want to treat yourself to some 'me' time, complete with a delicious fresh baked goodie you've been craving for months but haven't been able to find. Well look no further than this little gem in the middle of a business park. Very few places in Phoenix have high-quality baked goods as this place their pies are an absolute must taste like grandma makes! But beyond their baked goods is an awesome menu filled with great salads sandwiches and even homemade bbq items, it's really a unique cool little place and it feels like you're inside of a French bistro it's decorated so cute! I wasn't even expecting it but as an added bonus they had homemade iced tea and made me a fresh Arnold Palmer!",

Applewood smoked pull pork hash sauteed with peppers,onions and potatoes,served with two fluffy scrambled eggs, and delicious butter croissant with fresh made jam was one of pulled pork and sauteed onions  served on bacon cheddar scones with diced potatoes (hasish-shy for lack of a better description). The coffee (always n important factor) was strong and flavorful. Joan, our server. was also a huge fan...and she lived in Seattle.  That is always a great endorsement in my book. The BBQ sauce is a dark tomato based brown sugar with other goodies..brought back end heat. The Mojo Thunder sauce was thinner, more vinegary based and had a very balanced sweetness. To go...a few of their sprinkled cookies, and a \"personal\" size portion of a cherry tart and a pecan piece of goodness. Lucas was a wonderful cheerleader,  Dana Dumas is the founder and with her husband Bryan being the pitmaster. , they have created a wonderful mash-up of legit bakery and breakfast place. Dr. B",

The decor is bakery quaint.  Given the fleur de lys and the menu, someone hearkens from the South.  And, of course, the team was very friendly and knowledgeable.",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time today.   It's in a rather obscure place - inside an office building in kind of an out-of-the-way place behind Scottsdale Airpark, but it's obvious they have quite the following.  The place is small and cute - very quaint. There is a wide variety of their baked goods on display to tempt your eyes.  My colleagues and I all got the same sandwich: the Chicken Salad on Croissant. It was fantastic! The chicken salad had nuts and cranberries in it and a little heat in the background. The apple slaw was very delicious. My colleagues both had the cowboy beans and both loved them.  We each got a sweet treat to enjoy later... some of those baked goods on display. I really enjoyed my brownie.  It's a small place that will be very hard to get into in short order. So get there while you can!  The food was a little expensive, but I'm perfectly OK paying a little more for great food that was lovingly prepared by a locally owned business. The money I paid will stay in the community rather than some corporate fatcat back east. We will definitely be back!",

We wanted to try it all and got the Biscuits and Gravy, Parisian French Toast and an Omelette. We LOVED it all. My favorite hands down was the Parisian French Toast. Best I have ever had. The owners and our server were so pleasant, welcoming and wanted to ensure we had everything we need. Patio is opening soon and can't wait to come back and eat outside. Quaint place that is perfect for breakfast, lunch and coffee. I have a work from home job and always looking for a place to work with coffee and snacks. This will be the new place! Of course we couldn't resist taking some of the baked goods home. The Peach Cobbler..... O-M-G! We are from Michigan and cherry pie is a tall order to live up to with us but the Cherry Pie surpassed even the Traverse City places! If you haven't tried this place, definitely check them out. Incredible food, great people and you won't be disappointed. #sugarjam",

I asked if I can substitute the potatoes and they offered fruit but didn't disclose fee ($1.99). Fruit was soggy and not appropriate to serve. The coffee at $4/cup is a huge mistake given the quality and hesitation to refill. Would give BBQ a try but not inclined to return for breakfast.",

Server was completely untrained and unprepared, continuously forgot things, blamed others, and got the orders wrong. Gave me the wrong omelette (turkey, not veggie) with over cooked eggs and devoid of flavor. When I asked to speak to the manager, the manager took no ownership of the problem and instead blamed the server, the kitchen, and me for not complaining sooner--never mind that I had to wait nearly 25 minutes after taking a few bites of food and then sitting on the opposite side of the table from my plate before anyone asked me what was going on. He also wanted to debate with me whether the eggs were cooked properly and whose fault it was that everything was terrible.   The manager did ultimately take 50% off the check but it took another 10 minutes to get it after I asked for it. Ridiculous. Total time from ordering to getting the check was almost 90 minutes in a slow restaurant serving breakfast food.   If you want to get treated like crap and eat barely edible food, this is your \"jam.\"",

The thick slices of challah make this a super special treat!   My husband got the biscuits and gravy and my cousin has the savory scones- and they're all winners!   We purchased chocolate chip cookies to snack on later and they were soft and delicious!  The wait staff are all so nice and attentive! A must try if in the Phoenix area!",

The coffee was bold and perfect to kick start your day.  We took home a personal apple pie.  They do lunch here.  It's a husband and wife team.  Wifey does the delicious baking and the hubby does the smoked meats like pulled pork and brisket.  What an awesome team!  I can't wait to come back to try more from their menu.",

I had heard good things about this place before even showing up. The aroma that hits you from the parking lot is a mixture of sweet vanilla cake and robust southern grilled BBQ.  I had two sugar cookies and a chocolate chip cookie while waiting for my food. If heaven is anywhere close to those cookies, I'll be set for life. The soft but fluffy texture, combined with the buttery goodness.. so delicious.  I had the Pulled pork grilled panini.. so savory, tangy and crispy. The bread wasn't soggy, it was quite a delicious meal. The portions are large, and enough that I had half my sandwich left. The potato salad is sweeter, but also tangy at the same time.  The bakery is super cute, well decorated and very clean. If you are looking for a good meal, stop by this place. You won't go wrong.",

They also have lunch items which we did not sample this time, but will next time we are in which will be soon. My wife and I LOVED the caramel cookie. This was our very favorite. I also liked the peach, almond and other jam cookies. Really nice deep taste to the cookie and the jam just sent it over the top. I also tried the pumpkin muffin which I liked, again a nice deep pumpkin flavor. I also bought a cherry scone which had a most wonderful tart/sweet cherries in them. I really loved this one also. They have Lemon curd and honey buttery to go with any of these items and they were soooooo good, so don't forget to get these to go with your scones and muffins.  They will be adding award winning BBQ to their menu in early october which should be amazing. I can't wait. :)  Finally anyone who misses Pie in the Sky on thompson peak should RUN to SugarJam's for their PIES! I will be ordering my holiday pies from SJs very soon!.",

The young lady was very nice on the phone and I was told that it was too late to place an order but if I showed up at 8:30 in the morning the day before Thanksgiving they were going to have a couple pies available to the general public. So I set my alarm, grabbed my coffee and was out in front at 8 o'clock in the morning, was first in line!  Within minutes people started showing up behind me and the anticipation was palatable but.....I think I was going to get my pie's!  The doors were open at 8:30, and a young man greeted me. He jumped behind the counter and this is where it started  started to go wrong.  It was quite obvious he was not comfortable behind the counter. He gave me the impression that this was his first day or was filling in for somebody. Definitely not a position you would want to be in when it was probably going to be extremely busy! I reviewed the menu online spoke to a couple friends and knew I wanted a cherry pie, and also my favorite a pecan pie....a plain pecan pie mind you, NOT one with additional chocolate chips. As I watched the young man pull the pies from the case I reiterated once again that I wanted the a pecan pie no chocolate chips! Let's say the transaction for a payment was awkward but I was just happy I got my pies! I think some of you may while you're reading this awfully long review Are going to come to the realization before I actually say it.... after a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner, I served my pecan pie and guess what chocolate chips in side my pie!! (some of you might think oh well it can't be that bad but I was that person growing up that I always wanted the sugar cookie or the vanilla ice cream hate chocolate)! I also noticed that when I was cutting the cherry pie how very runny the filling was. The presentation was awful luckily I just covered the whole thing up with whip cream!  With expectations being so high and the cost of two pies equaling $54 I was very disappointed! Combine this with zero customer service, SugarJam receives one *  and that's because of your cute label sorry guys!!!",

Lucas (at front counter), Brian (server and husband of owner), and Leon (chef and father of owner) each came to talk to us and couldn't have been nicer and more generous. Service is absolutely exceptional.  For food, the turkey, egg, and cheese croissant with tomatoes was hearty, buttery, and delicious. My husband could not stop raving about the pulled pork sandwich. Get the mojo sauce if you like a sweet kick. I could drink the stuff. Their coffee with their chocolate cupcake with buttercream - holy cow.   They said they were expanding the place. Good for them. They deserve it. Can't wait to bring the whole family in.",

Not only does this place offer a quiet escape from the norm, it offers eats and sweets that are so familiar yet not what you can get everywhere else. My family of four had an amazing experience. The owner took the time to adjust my children's meal so they would enjoy it and she brought a cookie sandwich over for them free of charge when they had finished up. My husband and I loved our meals and desserts. Loved my lemon bar, but the cherry pie is to die for -- so sweet!  Update: We ordered a pumpkin pie for pick-up and it was even better than the cherry. Light, yet substantial. Sweet, yet hearty. I'm in heaven!",

There were only two other customers for lunch so they weren't busy. No excuses. Our server had to look at the menu to write down what we wanted and she literally wrote it down word-for-word on her order pad and asked us to repeat what we wanted. Water glasses sat empty for most of the lunch and then were not filled when wait staff did manage to check on us. Food (bbq Panini) was average at best and could be gotten at Applebee's. Potato salad was bland. Then to top off our dining experience they put our cookies in a wet box which we had to point out to them.   Good luck but given horrific service and mediocre food this place won't make it a year.",

    "text": "I discovered Sugar Jam at The Food Truck Caravan Event on Valentine's Day in 2015. I have been addicted to this place every since.  Why you ask?  Oh let me tell you...   EVERYTHING they make is made with love.  Love a mother has for her baby, love a kid has for the favorite blankie, love a man has for J-Lo's behind.  You know, pure LOVE!  I have had all of their pies, and the flavors are always on point.  I hate cherry pie, but Dana's is so good and the spices she uses compliment the cherry filling.  The crust is homemade and flaky.  I always get the mini pies that \"should\" be eaten in 2 servings.  I end up eating the whole thing every time and refuse to feel bad about it!    Her brownies should be called legal crack because they taste like actual chocolate!  Who has had horrible brown cake that was mislabeled as brownies before? *raises hand in shame*  The brownies are Sugar Jam are moist, nicely proportioned (should be eaten in more than one serving, but I never do), and delectable.  Goodness gracious they are so luscious.  My favorite is the caramel toffee explosion.  It's not too much of one ingredient, it is a nice balance that spreads across your taste buds and sends you to a euphoric place of chocolatey goodness.  If you find yourself needing to eat one in a dark room so no one can see or here you, go right ahead!  You can never go wrong with the classic brownie.  But when she is in a creative mood and makes a specialty flavor, get it!  She is very thoughtful of the ingredients she puts together.  You can tell from the first taste to the life shattering last bite or lick of the container.    Gosh I could go on and on because the cookies, cakes, scones (omg her scones... mmm...), muffins, sugar jamming cookies (another legal form of crack) are all amazing!  I haven't had her savory items but my husband has.  His eyes rolled till only the whites were showing.  So yeah... The savory items are great too!   They use fresh ingredients and take time to make things right everyday.  You aren't going to get inconsistent food from here. Dana and her staff truly love cooking and respect it as the art it is.",

However, this place as small and quaint as it may seem served us one of the best meals we have ever had. The pulled pork hash seemed a little odd, however we rolled the dice and gave it a try. We were amazed by the balance of sweetness, vs everything else on the plate. Honestly, this dish was amazing. Not to mention the home made fresh croissant and home made Apple butter. The portions were huge, but honestly you can't push the plate away. Not to mention, while you're trying to enjoy your meal, your sitting next to a display cooler full of some amazing looking pies and cupcakes. The couple who run the place are very sweet and personable.   In closing I want to point out, that upon leaving Scottsdale, we booked outlet flight around being able to go here again before we left.",

They were out of the French toast at 11AM on a Saturday, which was disappointing, particularly because it is a house specialty.  Once I tasted the pulled pork, I did not mind that they were out of the French toast.  The service was somewhat slow (seemed like a short- staff day), and it is not clear at first that you need to choose a table, then order at the counter - so if it's crowded, be sure and snag a table first.    The baked goods look incredible - taking some home!  Atmosphere is very fun also!    Will definitely return regularly, as the few downfalls are far outweighed by the food!!",

    "text": "First time here, disappointed.  The waiter does not know the menu, he told me fruit cup came with the breakfast it did not, he told me the a la carte items were the sides they were not.  He never asked how the food was. He was on his cell phone the whole time listening to someone screaming and watching baseball.  There are only 3 sandwiches items for breakfast on weekdays,  The place was empty when I arrived @ 0930.  No one was friendly along with the misinformation, not a good place.  The breakfast sandwich I did have was very tasty, but then they did not have any lunch items as I wanted to take one home but I had to leave and come back @ 11 am to order lunch.  I did get the crumb cake, the waiter said they made it with coffee in the cake but since he misinformed me about most everything on the menu, not sure if this is True.  The crumbs were spot on but the cake very dense when it should be light and airy.  The bbq sandwich I ordered for home the menu is very confusing and you do not get what you ordered, plus they have an upcharge for mac and cheese which the waiter misinformed me about also, The upcharge is not worth it as you get less than 2 tablespoons of boring mac and cheese $1.99.  Also not really sure the price for the bbq sandwiches seems overpriced $9.50 seems high.  While the food was pretty good, the staff was anything but, from the waiter not knowing the menu to the owner being ungrateful, unfriendly and angry.  The trip back is not worth the frustration.  Women please be careful as the sink in the ladies room moves and not very steady.  The place has a great layout with great pictures but it seems like a facade because the dining area is welcoming and the staff is definitely not. No Hello, thanks for coming and no goodbye and no one was smiling or looked happy to be there The owner should be more customer service oriented and she fell short this time.  After dealing with her, I am sure she will respond with something negative.",

My chopped brisket sandwich was knocked out of the park and each of those two BBQ sauces on the table have their own charm. The vinegary one though might be better to dip the sandwich into rather than squirt it on. Either way, the meat and both side dishes were a winner. The apple slaw had visible apple slices and something about that potato salad made it extra tasty after a brisket bite. Also was given a sample of Cowboy beans and wow those were quite next level as well. I had to select a baked good and ended up with a terrific triple chocolate brownie to go laced with icing on top. Will be back.",

    "text": "I wish there was a way to give no stars! My sister arrived at 10:30, ready to order for everyone, but it was suggested she wait for everyone's arrival. Apparently, they were short staffed, but we were never advised that our wait would be beyond ridiculous. The rest of our party arrived around 11 and ordered coffee the color of weak tea, then waited another 40 minutes before our breakfast order was taken.  We debated leaving, but with family visiting from out of town, we were enjoying each other's company and decided it couldn't possibly take too long for French toast and omelettes once we finally ordered.  Boy, we're we wrong! We were understanding about being short staffed and even went inside to get out own cream for coffee after asking at least 3 times and never recieving any.  The final blow came, however, when our food finally arrived at 1:10, and one order was missing the strawberries (They were out, but we hadn't been told) and my order was missing altogether. Instead of being honest, the server/owner went back inside to get my french toast and, after waiting a bit more, I went in to tell him to cancel if it wasn't already made.  He came back out to suggest it had been a computer error and another member of our party commented that we should have been advised of the problems they were having before we ordered. The server/owner started to say, \"well, the order was put in at 11:41 ...\" ( as though it's reasonable to wait an hour and a half for breakfast! ... and keep in mind, we waited a long time for our order to be taken in the first place.) At this point, the server/ owner became incredulous, unable to understand why we would possibly be upset!  We will not be back and highly recommend Butterfields, in Scottsdale, where we ate a couple days later and experience wonderful food and delightful service!",

It's a small place with a cute shabby chic decor and wonderfully friendly staff.   We came for brunch and had the Belgium waffle with ham and eggs and the Parisian French toast with bacon and eggs. While we were waiting for our food they brought out these cute little muffin poppers. The food took a while to come out but I think it was more due to the timing of our arrival before a large party than it being the norm as food started out coming out much quicker the longer were there. Brunch was delicious and the servings were huge. I could only finish half the waffle. The bacon that came with my husbands French toast was amazing and I would go back just for that but we are also anxious to go back for the BBQ. While waiting for our check we sampled their homemade BBQ sauce that was on the table and it was fantastic (if you are a lover of sweet sauces). We ended up buying a jar to take home. We also took a look at some of the tasty looking baked goods on our way out. They have an assortment of cookies, cup cakes, mini pies, scones, and bread pudding. It all looked wonderful but we grabbed a cream filled chocolate sandwich cookie to bring home for our son. I've already sampled a bite of this huge cookie and it is wonderful!!!!",

Instead of being charged half, I was overcharged quadruple the amount of my fare. He blamed both me and my guest's banks and his systems for not communicating but it clearly showed the charges live time on my account which I displayed. Without apologizing and doing something to make things right, Brian proceeded to go after me like a collector. Now think: If you were a business owner who valued their customers experience, you would  feel remorseful for messing up their finances and make things right and ensure that guest comes back. Instead Brian like a, credit card collector, wants to recharge my card again and blame systems rather than taking responsibility for mischarging my account as my bank quickly investigated. I was late on a payment because of this fiasco!!! I will never go back there.",

You are taken in by the charm of this little shop right when you walk in, with the cute little decorations, accents, and the explosion of lovely pastries that seem to surround you as you browse. In addition to baked goods they offer sandwiches for breakfast and lunch. The bbq meat in the lunch sandwiches are made by a pitmaster they work with.  I ordered a turkey breakfast sandwich with peppers and onions, and an assortment of baked goodies including an almond amaretto cookie, oatmeal cookie sandwich with buttercream filling, chocolate chip cookie sandwich with vanilla buttercream filling, peach cobbler cookies, and an apple pie muffin.   The turkey sandwich was excellent. The croissant it was served on was huge, and the turkey meat was well seasoned and plentiful. It didn't taste like that super processed stuff that you find in generic round loaves in shrink wrapped plastic. The peppers and onions were the perfect compliment to the fluffy scrambled egg, meat, and cheddar cheese.   The pastries were good, but a little too sugary sweet for my tastes (The generic \"sugar\" taste was overpowering the other flavors) . The textures were perfect though, especially for the almond amaretto cookie. It had the right balance of chewy with a slight amount of crunch.  Service was excellent and the gentleman at the counter knew the menu well and was very friendly.  The total for the sandwich and the ton of baked goods I got was around $26.  If I'm in the area around lunch I'll definitely be back to try some bbq sandwiches!",

They have mac and cheese with BBQ meats with collared greens which I passed on since we are here for brunch! The waffle was simply amazing, so crispy with their special flavored butter...the eggs are so fluffy...their ham was fantastic as well...the bacon was decent and the french toast was good but no where close to the waffle. That is a can't miss!! Ended with heated sweet potato pie with scoop of ice cream!!",

The interior is charming, decorated like a little Parisian Cafe! You order at the counter and then seat yourself. We had several goodies to choose from for Saturday's Menu. I had the French Toast with pecan syrup! It was wonderful served with eggs that were prepared perfectly and bacon! My fiance had the Brisket & Biscuits and I had to sneak a bite it looked so good! The flavor was amazing! A great smoke flavor with a fabulous rub on the meat! We also had a nice visit with Leon the father of the Owner! He was super kind and obviously very proud of what they do at their Cafe! It was nice Very to hear the history and the pride of this dad talking about his daughter  We will be back to enjoy another breakfast and I have to get one of those Cherry Pies!!",

I work right down the street and I have been here twice within the last week, the second time I brought seven other people with me and they all raved about their Boss Hog and brisket sandwiches. The pulled pork mac and cheese is also to die for. One commentator, who is originally from a town that does a lot of BBQ said that this was the best bbq sandwich he had had in Arizona! I have to agree. The warm, friendly environment and the fact that this is not a chain have put SugarJam on the go-to list for myself and my coworkers. Can't wait to try their Saturday brunch!",

It is fabulous. Very nice lady owns, bakes, and serves you. Her husband came from behind the counter just to introduce himself and thank me for coming in. Extraordinary people. The food and treats are wonderful. Cakes, pies, scones, cupcakes, cookies, and lunch items daily. I tried a cupcake and mini cherry pie. Both homemade, fresh and terrific. I was so pleased that I called them a day or so later and ordered a whole pie. One that wasn't on their menu but she made it for me anyway. Wow was it good and price was fair. . They do lots of catering from the understanding that I had. I have lived in AZ since 1963 and have wanted to find a good old fashion bakery, that is fresh and delicious. Thank you Yelp for helping me find Sugar Jam. Near Scottsdale Airpark. Worth the time to try it. They close mid afternoon, so go in morning or for lunch. You will want to write a review also.",
