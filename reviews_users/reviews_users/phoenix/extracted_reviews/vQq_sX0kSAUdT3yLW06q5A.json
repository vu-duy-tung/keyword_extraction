I had flour and I tried a variety and the best was the short rib, the carne asada and the chicken were good though too. Will definitely be back.",

Shrimp tamale (seriously yummy, grilled shrimp on top of a moist flavorful tamale), smoked baked potato--sounds strange for a Mexican food restaurant but it is epic! And, my all-time favorite?  The PIG WINGS!!!!  I can't describe what an amazing meal this is for only $8!!!!  It comes with a jalapeno slaw salad. You are going to miss out if you don't try this crazy, small strip center restaurant!  Btw, staff hasn't changed since I've been coming here. They remember me every time and I swear I don't eat here that often. Support this biz. It's one of a kind!!!!",

With all the piglets in the area from Pig & Pickle, Pig's Meow to the Whining Pig, this spot can get overlooked. Small, cozy and intimate without sacrificing personal space, you'll enjoy all the patrons that frequent here. But if you have wander lust when it comes to food and service, you'll think you walked through the looking glass of heavenly spot that's got to be a mirage in the desert. Raul is the perfect bartender, host, and entertainer along with the entourage of wonderful wait staff. He'll mesmerize you with his skillful acrobatics of making a \"mexican margarita.\" And who can refuse $3 Tecates on HH?   If you have read my reviews, it is no shocker I went for the stuffed burger. Why? I love COW. What better place to trust the meat than a butcher shop eh?! And it was stuffed with serrano chilies. Happiness eruptions from that combo! I love that the bun was actually smaller than the beef pattie. Since they don't serve fries, add the white cheddar mac'n'cheese. Believe me, there is no disappointment. My boyfriend had the dinner special which was the Mahi Mahi accompanied by chorizo pineapple rice. Let's say, Harry met Sally at this juncture of our date. As for appetizers, you will be pleasantly surprised by the half order of oysters and nachos. For most, that's an entire meal but I have a 3000 caloric intake that demands A LOT of food. The tacos are good, perfectly seasoned. OOHHAAHH, in two weeks they will be serving breakfast burritos at 9am on Sunday. I don't think I will leave. Honestly, this quality service and food deserves major accolades. I'm just happy they are humbly priced. What are you waiting for? Stop reading and pull up a chair next to us!",

We also got the carne asana tacos and they were dry, with only very dry meat and cabbage in them. They tasted good, but I expected more. The chocolate mousse cake we had after dinner was not very good, I wouldn't do dessert here again.   Overall I enjoyed eating here, I think your experience probably depends on what you order.",

Thank goodness they are now on DoorDash!  MUST GET: 1. Their taco combos.  My favorite meats are the al pastor and short rib. 2. Their house rice with pineapple and chorizo - best. rice. ever. and this is coming from a professional rice eater (Asian). 3. Recently tried this, don't know why I didn't do it sooner - their short rib entree.  YUM.  Mix the rice with the sauce and you've got one of the best combos out there.  Best part about this place is the price.  I ordered tacos for five people and spent $50.  They used to be a butcher, so the meat is top notch.    If you want some great Mexican food that's not heavy and full of beans, COME HERE!  You won't regret it :)",

Service  from Erica was perfect - she is one of the best servers I've ever had. Friendly, helpful, perfect timing without lurking. She even took our late night coffee order with a smile on her face even though she had to get it from the restaurant next door. THEN there is the food. Oh my. Everything was delicious - first time in a while I didn't leave someplace with a box. The house rice, shrimp and corn tamale and chicken taquitos deserve special mention, but everything ordered was fantastic. The pineapple sorbet is actually served in a hollowed out pineapple. Tee hee!  It probably says something when you're looking forward to your next visit within 24 hours of your first. Check this little spot out for sure. No happy hour and pretty pricey wine options.",

Service was extremely friendly and helpful. Being a sausage maker myself we talked about making sausage at home and recipes for quite a while. Very cool. They also have exotic game in the freezer for those that are feeling adventurous. I brought home a little of everything to try and it was delicious.  The Cafe has a sit down menu with Mexican selections that you can choose from for a great tasting meal or snack. I saw some colorful items coming out of the kitchen. One being the Tacos al Pastor. It both looked and smelt awesome. Can't wait to go back and eat something off the menu as well. Five thumbs up!",

Found something interesting things on the menu. The Dr. ordered a glass of wine while we look for something interest to eat.  She waited and waited.  Ordered wine with our food order 7-9 minutes later and when I didn't get my wine in a reasonable amount of time, I ask the server for it. She brought mine and still had not brought the Dr. hers.  Really? That wouldn't be the servers last mishap of the evening. She went and retrieve the wine but no sign of an apology, I'm so sorry.. nothing. We ordered.  I had the shrimp tamales which were decent enough and the Dr. had tacos which she ordered with flour tortillas and got them with corn tortillas.  I had also ordered a side of beans which I never received.  The guac and salsa where ok to better than average.  Nothing super special (We are two real deal guac heads. We know guac).  The pour of the wines of was very generous. Think 10-12 ounces but when the Dr. tasted my Rioja, she immediately wrinkled her nose and said that is old and sour. We looked at each other with that look that says \"ok we gave them a shot but we ain't never coming back here\" and ask it was time to ask for the check.   I let our server know I never received my side of beans so I don't want to pay for it.  She said 'oh, you don't have to pay for them.  You want them now?' She had just cleared our table of all the empty dishes from what did arrive and our silverware.  I said no, just the check and looked at the Dr. with that 'did we teleport to bizarro world or something'.. We left a small tip and left....won't ever go back.",

Started with the avocado bruschetta, huge chunks of fresh avocado with tomatoes and a kick of hot sauce on lightly toasted buttered bread. Flavor explosion! For my meal I had the al pastor tacos and a side of their house rice. The meat was tender and the veggies and salsa were fresh and crisp. The house rice was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spices as well as chopped chopped chorizo embedded in between the tasty grains. Topped off the evening with a piece of their key lime pie, and I was in foodie heaven! Our waitress Erica was attentive, personable and very sweet. It made our dining experience at The Blind Pig exceptional. Highly recommend this restaurant and can not wait to go back!!",

    "text": "Oh The Blind Pig...what can I say about you?  How about that you serve some of THE BEST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD!!!  Seriously.  Dining in Scottsdale was an absolute joy seeing as to how many high quality dining establishments there are there.  So when a special one comes about, I can't stop gloating about it.   Unfortunately I moved away only a couple of weeks after discovering you so I won't be back for a while (unless you're thinking of opening up a Blind Pig in Dallas, TX).  But I will recommend you whole-heartedly to absolutely anyone interested in a different spin on Mexican food.    PS: Your steak and grilled veggie quesadilla had me in tears.  It was pure perfection.  It's unfair how high you set the bar with that one because now no quesadilla is remotely as good or memorable.",

Tacos come on flour or corn and you can even get grilled shrimp tacos which aren't on the menu but just ask they will make it for you! This review is long overdue. I eat here at least 3 times a month when I'm not traveling.   Some of my favorite items are:  Great Guacamole  House Rice Short Rib Tacos (one of their signature items) Grilled Shrimp Tacos They also have a Shrimp dish entree that is delicious  Green Salsa is excellent  Short Rib nachos (the absolute best nachos in town!!!) I often get these to go so no one can watch me pig out on them.they are so freaking good!!  I also enjoy the professional staff. They have had the same people working there for years. They treat everyone like a regular and are super sweet and kind. I often get to go orders as mentioned above and they have never messed my order up. They are one of the few constantly consistent restaurants in town.  This is absolutely casual Mexican dining at its best. They also have live entertainment on Sunday afternoons in the summer and the band has grown to perform some nice epic country songs that are indicative of the southwest. Last time I was there one dude even had a fiddle. It was so freaking cool.   This is a super laid back place with excellent street Tacos and more. Service is always great. If you're looking for an authentic Arizona dining experience this is the place. No fluff no frill just great food in a neighborhood restaurant with full bar!",

My 3 star review for The Blind Pig has nothing to do with their quality of food but rather one specific thing regarding their service.   Let me be clear that the food is amazing and delicious and savory and very different from other Mexican places.  You can't go wrong with almost anything on their menu.  My issue is that the only time I go here is with a few co-workers or clients as it is close to my office. And the last few times I have gone the restaurant refuses to split checks and says that they are not able to do so.  What restaurant does that? Why aren't you able to split checks? Why are you refusing to do so? If you have a crowd of 5-6 co-workers eating lunch there you are putting one of them in a very uncomfortable position in paying for everyone and than attempting to collect reimbursements later.  Very inconvenient and disappointing. Until this process is changed I will not be returning.",

Start out with the Pig Wings - best BBQ ribs you'll ever have (well, pork ribs - my beef ribs are pretty hard to beat).  Never was much of a 'dipper', but the dipping sauce for the Pig Wings has got me dipping wings in blue cheese now.    Then, go for the Shrimp Tamales.  Grilled shrimp on sweet corn tamales, smothered in a creamy sauce that's got a citrus-tart kick that contrasts perfectly with the tamale.  Amazing.  Then, finish off with the Key Lime Pie - best Key Lime Pie I've had anywhere!!",

Over the past several visits I have noticed a marked decline in the quality of food, the serving sizes, and most importantly the service. Tonight I tried to order food for takeout at 8:30 and they told me they decided to close early because it was a slow night and would only accept cash. I know the owners and give them a call just to make sure they were OK with this type of customer service only to be informed that it is no longer owned by Sally. I met the new owner when I came to pick up my order and remarked on my concerns with the change in the quality of food and service and she was absolutely Uconcerned with my dissatisfaction. It's sad but hopefully they will figure out that the reason this restaurant was so successful is because of their attention to detail and the new owners will revert back to proven tradition. For now. Stay away.",

    "text": "Showed up at about 9:30pm on a Friday night. The inside room was 100% full and the outside was about 30% full. Stood outside. Nobody came and acknowledged me. Stood inside the doorway. Nobody acknowledged me. Stood at the bar. Nobody acknowledged me. Meanwhile, my date had just grabbed menus from somewhere an sat herself on the patio. By the time i finally got someone i basically said \"oh hey, nevermind there she is\" so it isnt like we sat somewhere that the staff didnt know about.\" This ordeal lasted maybe 8 minutes...  Sat down and after about 3 minutes, someone dropped off water. Then another 3-5 minutes passed by and someone came and got drink orders. We got our drinks, finished our drinks, and... you guessed it, nobody. So we hollered at someone that worked there to close our \"drink tab.\" They did and we left.  I'm not sure how long we were there but I'd say an honest 30 minutes between waiting outside like a dork and waiting outside at the table before we called it quits.  To make matters worse, none of the heaters outside were on. Half the time we were there someone was fiddling with it. As it turns out, the last thing you want is a cold date. And before you say it I'm not one who wants a bunch of attention. I don't. But I do want someone to -heaven forbid- seat me and take my order! They looked like they literally had twice the business they were staffed for.  Apparently we weren't the only ones with this experience because a table near us (also outside, family of four) got up, tossed cash on the table, and left. They had it too. The other 4 tables outside with us that were occupied also had no food - and they were all there before we waited around on the sidewalk/lobby/bar waiting for someone to seat us.  I can't stress enough how laid back of a person I am when it comes to dining. No joke, I've had food come to my table with hair in it and I didn't complain. The wrong food was brought to me and I didn't complain. I've had drinks spilled on me and I didn't complain. So to warrant me to rate the place low like this hurts me. But I'm pretty sure most people would have walked away long before I did, some without paying (if you have to get up and track someone down to close your bill...). But the fact is that Blind Pig was attempting to race the figure -8 with a unicycle against legitimate race cars.  The food must be out of this world for it to hold 4 stars with this kind of service.",

We trolled Yelp before settling on The Blind Pig and it was awesome. We started off with some drinks and decided that we were just going to order a variety of appetizers instead of separate meals. We ordered the Chips with Salsa and Guac, the ceviche and the chorizo nachos.... and a side of chorizo. Everything we got was homemade and SO flavorful. My favorite was definitely the ceviche, however. A huge portion and the flavor was so good that even the liquid was worth trying to scoop onto my chips after the rest was gone :) The guacamole was very good and the salsas were both rather spicy. The nachos were the only thing that kind of disappointed. The flavors were great and the meat was good, but they were under the broiler for a few minutes too long.. we had to break apart the chips as the cheese melted hard and they were very dry.... oh well, more reason for another margarita ;) A great experience and if we are ever back in Tempe, I will be dying to try more of their menu.",

I can't ever eat more than half of the order and it was only $8 - seriously, great deal. I have had samplings of others food and have been equally as impressed with other dishes from the menu. I have picked up the order a couple of times and have found that the service is always friends and efficient. Even more impressive - the order has always been right.

The food was pretty tasty but we had to buy chips & salsa as it didn't come complimentary like with other Mexican restaurants. The chips were stale & tasted like they came from a bag vs fresh or homemade. For our main meal I had the special, chicken enchiladas with red sauce on the side (which I'm glad I did cause it was kinda grainy; definitely bean based which I didn't care for). It was served with their house rice which had an interesting blend of pineapple, cilantro & other spices. It was AMAZING; best rice I've ever tasted! However their guacamole was awful; very acidic tasting, to the point lemon / lime juice overpowered the avocado ruining the entire dish. Our server quickly took it away when we complained however. My boyfriend had the carne asada tacos which were flavorful but extremely tiny. He also had the rice & enjoyed it immensely. Overall this restaurant was good with a few minor flaws. I'd come here again & try DQ offer items on the menu. I'd recommend it.",

Now there isn't much to a carne asada taco, but mess up one or two of these ingredients and I'm out. Number 1 and my most important ingredient is the meat. The Blind Pig seasoned the meat perfectly and grilled to perfection. Meat wasn't dry and trimmed of all fat. Number 2 is the tortilla, has to be homemade or from a local tortillaria. The tortilla was from one of those. Soft corn tortillas that didn't break and had some flavor to them. The rest of the ingredients just need to be fresh. Make sure you get the chips and salsa. Once again made there or somewhere in town. Looking forward to going back to The Blind Pig and trying some of the other refrigerated animals in the butcher case!!",

A butcher shop (Hobe Meats) and cafe (concept from the owners of Uncle Sal's and Side Door Corner Store) that serves up some tasty food, has pretty darn good service, and very good prices. Can't hate on that.  They've got a nice little assortment of tables inside and a great patio outside. Granted they could probably do more with it from a decor and lighting standpoint, but maybe that's what they're going for, who knows.  What I do know is that the tacos here are fantastic - al Pastor are my favorite and they kick you in the mouth with a good amount of spice that keeps the drink refills coming. The must have for me and the girl every time we come is the Avocado Bruschetta - don't second guess it on simplicity, just eat it and be happy.  The butcher shop here is great and I've picked up quite a few things like their bacon, NY Strip Steaks, and beer brats. They basically have every kind of meat you would need to put on a high quality barbecue for you and your friends.  Come support a great local restaurant and meat purveyor, you wont be disappointed.",

Thanks for the tip fellow yelpers.   Oh an the wine pours are very generous which of course I love.   Minus one star because the inside could use a facelift it's rather dark and not very inviting. However, the outside is beautiful so sit outside if the weather permits.",

The cocktails were not, but the bartender was so obnoxiously cute I would've probably choked down whatever she could wring out of the bar towel. I'm lucky my gf doesn't mind if I'm a creepy ogler once in awhile - she thought she was hot as well.   The drinks we tried had either too much alcohol or were too sweet. They were really accommodating and sweet to us, so we felt bad saying we didn't like them.   Anyway, regardless - the mac and cheese stood out, and we liked the salsas and guacamole. We will definitely go back.",

The portion of crab was very generous.   I had the short ribs with the house rice. The house rice has some secret in ingredients to include small chunks of pineapple and surprisingly was crazy good with the short ribs. I craved the shorts ribs all week and went back the next week.   The margs are classic and good at a very reasonable price.  This place is a must try, you won't go wrong.",

The tacos are average, and come with an overly generous supply of shredded cabbage. The meat in the tacos was overcooked and, while flavorful, dry. Could have been the (Monday) night.",

Don't go looking for free chips and salsa to go with your Mexifood here--that's a separate item on the menu, and you'll be paying for it.  It's worth it.  At The Blind Pig, they have only the very freshest ingredients, and the food has the flavors to show it!  My tacos salida were remarkable, and the mac & cheese needs to be tasted to be believed.  I could go on, but I'm going to cop out and suggest that you go here to really find out how good this place is for yourself.  There are a lot of great Mexican joints out there, but this one is pretty unique in its own way.  Somewhere between the spice balance and the freshness, this place really stands out.  Really--you'll want some for lunch the next day.  Prices ain't bad either.",

Their prized dish, the shrimp tamale, is really 3 small, week-old shrimp, served over an overly sweet polenta mixture. We finished about 3 bites.   Who serves guacamole in a coconut shell?  The drinks were another low point. Served in soft drink style glassware my martini became some mix that was more like a margarita, and the \"Mexican mule\" was an over-sold limeade.   The service was terrible, and slow. One of our party requested hot water to calm her stomach and they literally said that they had NO HOT WATER in the whole restaurant. I question, then, how they wash their hands or make their coffee. The waitress was super snotty and not at all fun or friendly.   They charged a 19% gratuity on our $100 bill for 6. I'm a big tipper but that would be a bit presumptuous even at a fine dining establishment. Clearly they get you because they know you wouldn't tip otherwise.   Pass, pass, pass...drive a bit further west and go to barrio urbano or another joint near camelback. This place is no good, at all...",

    "text": "I've been to the other two sister restaurants in the same plaza, but had not yet checked this one out.  It was a weeknight, and they were not all that busy, so it was a good chance to try out some of their popular dishes.    The oysters Rockefeller / chips + salsa were really great appetizers.  It was my first time having oysters that way and will definitely not be my last.  The salsa was fresh and chips were perfectly warm and salted.  For the entree I got the chorizo pizza - mostly because I like house made chorizo and wanted to give this unique twist on a pizza a shot.  When it arrived on the table, I saw all the fresh cabbage on top and remembered the last time I had lettuce / cabbage on a pizza was the time I tried a taco pie in Idaho - which was an epic fail.  This didn't fail as bad, because it gave the pie a nice crunch / texture alternative.  But the next day, as you might imagine, it didn't quite hold up.  The flavor combination just wasn't ideal and not something I'd order again.  That said, the service was solid and the appetizers were really good so when I come back I'll just try something else.",

We showed up for lunch at noon. There were four other customers total besides us at the restaurant.   We didn't get our food till 12:49pm. The waiter didn't say sorry or even try to offer an excuse for the delay.   One of the people I was with found a piece of glass the size of his thumb in his food. The majority of the food was cold or skip the simple request given of \"no onions\".   I strongly suggest skipping this place. Between the waiter not really caring about the customer experience and the glass. It's not worth the gamble.",

The service was slower than I would have expected but nothing that was too annoying. They have a very large outside section so when its not summer time it would be nice to sit on the patio.   We ordered the house guacamole, which was chunky and fresh. The two dips that came with it were very nice, I think my favorite would be the tomatillo green sauce which was surprisingly spicy (in the best way!). I ordered the Shrimp and sweet corn tamale which was truly amazing, so fresh and the flavors were perfectly balanced. The house rice with chorizo and pineapple is equally flavorsome. My father got a torta which he was very impressed with, and my mother wouldn't stop talking about how her al pastor pork burrito was the best one she'd had since moving here from California. The burrito isn't full of rice and other starchy fillers, its just a proper meat burrito packed with fresh flavors. The portions are large and the prices aren't bad at all, much better than across the street at Carlsbad Tavern (which in my opinion isn't much better than taco bell).  The butcher also had alot of interesting and hard to come by meats, which all looked relatively fresh. I got a center cut bone with marrow for my dog (my dog is 130lbs and eats equally massive bones) and it only cost me $3.47! So much cheaper than at PetSmart and its actually fresh.  All in all, couldn't love this place more. One thing would be the timing of the service but apart from that 100% wonderful.",

Our waitress was admittedly brand new and had only tried 1-2 things on the menu, so she couldn't really anwser any of our questions about the dishes.   A few minutes after putting in our order we were told the kitchen ran out of bolillo rolls for the Torta Ahogada. We ended up substituting it with a Portuguese roll (tasted very similar to a bolillo). When our food did come out the tacos were on flour tortillas (yuk) and not corn like we asked for and the torta was NOT ahogada (drowned) like we specifically asked for.   However everything tasted great! Drinks were strong and delicious. Guacamole was fresh and a great price. The Mahi had a great flavor and I really liked the pickled veggies that came with the torta.   Like I said I will def give this place another try! I think we just had some bad luck with a new server and the kitchen not being prepared for busy weekend.",

We got there around 4:30pm and place was empty with the exception of a few regulars having drinks at the bar.  One of the regulars at the bar (an older woman) had an annoying voice and was excessively loud.  I ordered a margarita and they did not have gold premium tequila ... I settled for the silver patron with no salt.  When drink came it was horrible ... no salt on the rim but excessively salty.  I took a small sip and my stomach was already turning in a bad way.  I got the waitresses attention and let her know that the drink was upsetting my stomach and it was best for me to not drink it and that I did not want to be charged for it.  She said no problem and took the drink away and did not even ask if she could get me something else instead.   I wouldn't be surprised if she gave the drink to the regulars that were at the bar because I overheard one say ... oh premium tequila.  When the bill came the $12 margarita was in the bill.  I brought this to the waitresses attention and she said no refunds on drinks.  Gee, why didn't she say no refunds when I returned it and requested her to take it off my bill (and she answered no problem).  If I would have known this, I would have asked for a Corona (something I know I could have drank without problems).  On our way out, my friend noticed a sign on their patio stating patio seating is for 4 or more only (all the tables are one size with 4 chairs).  Talk about discriminating.  I guess if you're wanting a place to take your date or significant other, wanting to catch up with a friend or are a party of 3, you are limited to inside seating only.   Avoid this place.",

We've tried almost everything on the menu and for the most part have been impressed. Some standouts are the guacamole salad, ceviche, pig wings, and short rib tacos. The shrimp tamale is sweet and decadent - not a typical tamale but good in its own right. I've seen a couple reviews complaining that the food lacks flavor, but that has never been our experience. The food definitely tends to have a good spicy kick to it, but if that is not your preference there are plenty of mild options to choose from. We've always had great service, and as frequent guests it is a treat that the servers remember us and our favorite food and beverages. The menu is priced so reasonably that it's easy to pass on a happy and just eat here. It's definitely our preference to shop local whenever possible, and the Blind Pig continues to be one of our favorites.",

I had the torta that was featured in the magazine and it was not good at all.  It had zero flavor, the sauce they put on the side has no flavor either.  I don't know what they use for chicken but it is lame.  It was like dried leftover pieces of dark meat that people would just toss (I am talking not real chucks of meat here).  I had chunks of cartilage, and other gross things, and it was dry, dry, dry and again no flavor.  I guess the meat just turned me off.  My husband got the pork sandwich with the coleslaw and said it was OK. He ended up only eating the pork because the slaw was overly salty and there was a lot of that piled on there.  Overall, I would not be giving this place a second chance, just not worth it with all the other places to eat.  If your in the area go down to the next corner and eat at the pig and pickle, that actually deserves a \"best\" nod.",

This will now be on my mandatory dining place each time I drop into town. Our server Christine could not have been more helpful and delightful.  Hats off to the chefs.  Thank you for the great meal.

    "text": "(Visited April 26, 2017)  First time here, for both Karen W. and me, and patio seating was enjoyable until our food arrived, and then all of the flies came to investigate.  Mid-dining, I was ready to ask for a table indoors, but it was such a lovely day out, I thought I'd try to ignore the pesky buggers.  The tables were arranged in a circle patio with umbrellas for shade, and there's a quaint water fountain next to it.  The Blind Pig is surrounded by other restaurants owned by the same owner/s: Uncle Sal's and The Side Door.  I seem to recall visiting Uncle Sal's for dinner after work a few years ago.  I'd seen a glimpse of TBP's bar when I went to use the restroom after lunch, and the bar reminds me of Uncle Sal's bar.  I also noticed that TBP's small indoor space is very noisy, and it wasn't even full of people.  I can just imagine how thunderous it must sound on a busy night!  Since I hadn't had a bite to eat (I got up at 10:20 am after five hours' of sleep so that I may get ready in time to meet Karen for lunch at 11 am-- I was a few minutes late), a few things looked interesting to me, so I decided I'd try the Queso Fundido app and the Torta Ahogada, minus the avocado.  The queso fundido came with tortilla chips.  I asked if the server would find out if the kitchen could cook up a batch of flour tortilla chips- I've had a few restaurants succeed in making some for me!- but she said no.  Didn't even try, or feign an attempt to ask.  However, she did offer to bring flour tortillas, which arrived barely warmed.  I thought the app was good, but then again, I was very hungry.  I also had more of the chorizo than Karen did, apparently.  <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-scottsdale?select=OpS_5k7LNcMxwa4-_HN9uQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  The torta ahogada was just OK-- refried beans, queso fresco, pickled jalapenos, and red chili sauce atop shredded chicken encased in a bolillo roll. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-scottsdale?select=edkOfO7TSiYC7sNQZNmn7w&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  This torta did not look appetizing to me, but, as I've written, I was hungry...  I found the roll to be too soft- it could've been grilled or toasted longer, and the refried bean sauce spilling over the top of the bread did not look good at all. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-scottsdale?select=FNyn9yVqfsjp_Afy0WhJ7g&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  Karen W. ordered the \"Pig Wings\" app, which were two small grilled bone-in pork shanks with chipotle glaze. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-scottsdale?select=nXR9Got3gYlgYQCm3R5bdw&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  I tried one and it was OK.  See a pattern here?  I could've eaten more of the piece I had, but I wanted to save room for my app and torta.  She ordered a shrimp entree for her mains, and I did not taste it, as I have seafood/shellfish allergies. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-scottsdale?select=1qM_CI14Py7xO6ncnp0lTQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  She didn't like the fact that the shrimp were swimming in sauce, but she seemed to enjoy the shrimp!  We didn't order dessert, because Karen was full from the apps and her entree and I try to select only desserts made in-house, and The Blind Pig does not offer any (made in-house).  TBP was a many years' old bookmark, and I gave it a try, and that's enough.  I'd say sipping cocktails and other beverages may be a safe bet out on the patio...  Just don't order food, or you'll have flies flocking over you while you eat-- eeks!  p.s.  My glass of water arrived with black particles in it, so I asked for another.  I hoped those flakes were just carbon that managed to escape the filter encasement.  Tasted the water that arrived, and it was bad- Scottsdale water doesn't taste great unless filtered through a \"state-of-the-art\" filtration system, like many of the \"newer\" and higher-end establishments like to boast they use.  I ordered coffee, hoping that the water's bad flavor wouldn't overwhelm the coffee flavor-- the coffee tasted weak.  Save yourself the time and money and get your coffee fix elsewhere.  Also, bring your own bottled water if you're dining in.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place as I took some E Coast family there for a Mexican dinner and out of Los Olivos, Frank and Lupes and this place, they chose this place. I really wanted to like this place. My mom and I arrive first and we sat down waiting for the others to arrive. We sat at the table about over 5 mins before anyone acknowledged us and never asked if we wanted a drink or anything, when they did acknowlege us. I mean just because we said we were waiting for someone doesn;t mean we didn't maybe want a cool drink. It's hot outside and it's August at 6 pm. We asked to take a recently vacated 1/2 booth-1/2 table on the other side of the restaurant and the server cleaned it up and brought menus and silverware. I ordered my mom a margarita (what kind of margarita is made with orange juice included?) which arrived in a glass exactly like my water came in. Ok, no biggie.  The others finally arrived. The first sip of my water tasted salty and I remarked to all that maybe it was an improperly cleaned glass or it hit the salty side of the margarita glass.. Sipped from the other side and everything was fine. I ordered enchiladas (\"house rice\" on the side), mom order the short rib on a bed of \"house\" rice but her short rib came on a bed of white rice as did the other guests short rib meal at the table. Another guest ordered the burrito and when it arrived it looked reminiscent of a Walmart wrap full of meat, minus the cheese and lettuce. The two kids got tacos which I never looked at.  My enchiladas were really really tasty but not worth $14 + $2.50 extra for red rice with pineapple in it- house rice. I couldn't get past the OJ in a margarita and the white rice and pineapple in something imitating spanish rice. NONE of the meals come with the customary refried beans and spanish rice. like I'm used to. I was flat out wishing we had gone to Los Olivos, a place serving mexican for the last 70 yrs. I've even enjoyed Fiesta Burrito food more than I was enjoying this place. Everyone had almost finished and the server came over and we requsted 2 to go containers and 2 more drinks for the kids. Someone different came back with the containers and the bill. After about 10 mins of going over the bill, someone came back over to answer a question regarding the bill and then different lady came a few minutes later with the 2 drinks. They weren't that crowded that the lag in service was justified. All in all, a very lack luster experience. I couldn't help but also stare at the wall that had the bottom half of a man like it was half painted. The tree he was under was half painted too. I won't be going back, by myself or taking anyone else. I was embarassed. Although they chose the place, PA folk should get something resembling real mexican food than short rib and a rice with pineapple in it. The name The Blind Pig should have been a dead giveaway.",

Ticket time for some oysters, salad and a burger was close to 20 minutes.  Waiter was more interested in skirt scavenger hunt rather than actually waiting on tables.  Food not much to write home about.  Grilled chicken salad was hot chicken placed directly over cold greens.  Pineapple and beans were straight from can.  Croutons soaked in oil to the point of sogginess.  Oysters were mediocre with a red hot sauce that was better left in its jar.  Stuffed burger advertised bacon, but finding bacon embedded in patty was an impossible task.  For premier pricing, one would expect something better than canned ingredients.  Doubt we'll be back.",

I love how different their options are. Definitely not your typical Mexican restaurant but the flavors are authentic to me. We had the pig wings and those were so so good. It comes with a little pickled salad as well and I was obsessed with it. And that jalapeno ranch? Get outta town. My friend got the taquitos and beans. Both super tasty. And I got the famous shrimp and corn tamale. Tons of flavor. Amazing sauce. Shrimp were cooked perfectly. My only issue with it was that the corn was too sweet for my taste. But that's just because I don't like sweet stuff. It was really an awesome dish. Shit, even their lemonade was good. And on top of that we had great service from the sweetest man. Didn't catch his name though. I'm coming back to try the mushroom quesadilla and the al pastor. Yummmmm!",

The taco varieties was very nice, just the right amount of specialness including fish tacos.  The Carna Asada burro was full of nicely grilled and flavorful beef.  The mushroom Quesadilla was the hit of the table juicy and delicious.  Not you normal sauce covered Sonoran food for sure.",

The patio is beautiful...next to a nice fountain and heat lamps for when it gets cool.  We heard the patio was pet friendly, but really it isn't...we had to keep our pup outside of the fence of the patio...luckily, it was right next to where we were sitting, so it was as if she was on the patio with us.    The food was amazingly reasonable and super tasty!  We tried the carne asada burrito with house rice, the carne asada and al pastor tacos with house rice and we shared a side of the ridiculously tasty butcher beans...you must try these - trust me, you will understand once you taste how delicious they are!",

(Holy crap - has it really been 20 years since I lived in the area?!?!) Those days are long gone. Dinner was on me for coordinating - and I dropped the ball.  Luckily, the Blind Pig was right next door, and we 4 hungry patrons could be seated and served right away.  We shared a couple plated for the table, and nibbled each other's entrees. The steak salad was a winner. The short rib was well cooked and flavorful. And everything else was perfectly OK. I had a trio of tacos  - none of which really stood out. Nothing wrong with them. Fresh, flavorful, well executed. I am just spoiled by other places in my current 'hood.  If I am in the area, and someone suggests the Blind Pig, I won't object.  I also don't think I'd plan another meal there. Nothing in the world wrong with the place - just no \"wow\" factor for me.",

Had lunch at The Blind Pig today and I was very happy with my experience. They have some wonderful taco choices. I tried the pork, short rib, and mahi mahi. The short rib was my favorite, the pork my least favorite. They probably ended up with four instead of five stars because of that pork - way too dry. The mahi mahi was good, though. You can get a really nice taco plate with two tacos and rice or beans for only $6. I got the beans, hubby got the rice. Both were tasty, but the beans were awesome. The taco plate left me pleasantly full and was bigger than I expected for the price.  Service was very good. We paid a total with tip of only $45 for four people for a really nice lunch with beverages. Seriously, though, you could get away with spending even less. And the food is very good.",

What is your purpose dude? You made it over to my table and put on menu on there, but you couldn't take my order?  I received water, but nothing else as I then decided to grab a take-out order. NO WHITE MEAT CHICKEN. This is a sign of a cheap place. Only the drive through taco joints don'[t serve white meat - you would expect it from a sit down joint. Waste of space. What do you do with the white meat of the chicken? Do you throw it out - cause if your smoking your own meats then the chicken comes with white meat. They are just too lazy to separate the meat. Can't take this place seriously.",

I got the Adobo Braised Short Ribs with house rice (+$1.00). The short ribs dish was only $10. It was so flavorful, both with a slight sweetness and spiciness. It was the perfect balance. Additionally, the short rib was tender but not overly tender that it falls apart.   My husband got the carnitas house sandwich. The cold slaw in the sandwich didn't drown out the carnitas. It complimented it perfectly. The carnitas was the center of attention.   As a starter, we got the cerviche. It's hard to get it wrong. The shrimp was fresh and the larger type. There was just a hint of spiciness.   Love this place. Too bad I'm from out of state, otherwise I'll be coming here all the time.",

    "text": "So after having taking about a year off from going to fun new places due to my new fabulous baby , I had been wanting to check this place out for MONTHS. Finally I made it in with a few of my girlfriends (the hubs was a little annoyed to miss out, sorry guy!)  First - this place isn't huge. The staff is super accommodating and tries to make it work, but just know that if you have a large group or if you are heading over during a busy time, you may have to wait.   I had heard that during the day there is a butcher shop inside, and while we sat & talked I took a peek at that menu. I am planning on heading over this weekend to pick up some steaks to grill at home - it all looked delicious.  We all split a bottle of Pinot Noir, and ordered a bunch of items to share. The guac appetizer is delish, and we shared the mushroom quesadilla which surprised me with how good it was. I'm normally not a fan of quesadillas, so I'm always happy to be proven wrong.  We ordered the pork sandwich (I don't remember the name) and HOLY CRAP it was incredible! I had a hard time sharing and felt guilty that the hubs wasn't there to try it.   We'll definitely be back. Loved all the food and the friendly atmosphere.",

I ordered  just an appetizer avocado bruschetta and a glass of pinot griot , the avocado bruschetta was good but the lemon was overwhelming left me with that bitterness taste in my mouth, my advice - adding a bit of mango and going easy on the lemon.   What i liked the most was the smell of other customers dishes and their reaction while tasting the food..  Heard a lot of  \" oh wow this is delicious\"  Overall it was very pleasant, servers where nice and attentive. My favorite spot was the patio.. Just sitting by the fountain. I am looking forward to coming back and ordering other dishes off their menu. I will recommend to friends and family.",

Additionally, she put in our starter and entrees at the same time so everything came out at once. I really don't like when that happens. Anyhow, maybe it was someone else's fault but it still was an unpleasant start to the evening.  Food:  What I had was Delicious. Something as simple as Avocado Bruschetta was elevated by the simple addition of Lime Juice, Tapatillo, and Red Onion. Think of this as Guacamole without it being all liquidy and mashed up. Wonderful giant chunks of avocado and tomato. The portion was fantastic; I would go back just for this.  Additionally, I had the Shrimp Tamale. While the shrimp was VERY overcooked the portion size was perfect and it had an amazingly creamy, flavorful, rich sauce I wanted to lick off the plate.  My dining companion had the Mushroom Quesadilla. We agreed that while, again, the flavors were incredible...the execution was a tad off. When you bite into it water from the mushrooms drips onto the plate. It happens, they're mushrooms. But you need to cook them down first. Then you can place them into the tortilla and grill. This preparation would help them out greatly.   Overall: Food: B- Server: C - She WAS super friendly though, and apologetic Ambiance: B+ The Restaurant, while on the smaller size, has a nifty little bar in the middle, and an outside patio which can be taken advantage of during great weather.  I'd give my experience a solid B-  Once they work out some of the kinks with food prep, running out of items and making sure that the servers are aware of it, they'll do very well.",

Great flavor, huge chunks off tomato and avocado. -Entree: tacos; pollo, carne, short rib. Very disappointing.. dry, lacking flavor, barely any meat. -Entree: short ribs over (house) rice. House rice worth the upcharge, meat was tender and yummy.  Service Slooooow. And just generally not good. Two servers to cover both the bar and dining area. Granted the place is small, but every table was filled, so they were busy.. but that meant we never saw our server... except for when we left and saw her texting up a storm outside.  I'd give it one more try because some of the food was good, but overall, I am completely unimpressed.",

The service was EXCELLENT and I will be returning here again this week to try their short rib entree.  Again, I highly recommend it and can't wait to bring my family here.

It is VERY small inside, holds maybe 60  people +/-.  We  waited forever for the food, when it came out, mine (Mac n' Cheese) was not even hot, it was good but not hot as it should have been coming out of the kitchen.  My friend ordered Fish 'n Chips, which came with fries, they were steak fries, and it looked like got about 10 fries. For the prices they charge, it was $100 for 4 of us, it seems a little over priced, especially since one person just ordered a salad, the other a burger.   I'm not a fan, but I don't hate it either, and I likely will not take anyone who visits me there, and \"I\" am not likely to return.",

The owner/waiter promptly took our drink order and gave us some recommendations. Prior to getting dinner, we got some chips with green and red salsa, and Guacamole. The Guacamole here was phenomenal. Certainly in my top 2 that I've ever had.  For the main course, I had the Burrito al Pastor, which was pork with a little bit of heat, but not overly so. I also gotta side of their House Rice which looked like Mexican rice and also had Pineapple in it. The food here is prepared fresh daily and was AMAZING!  Our waiter was very personable and talked to us for some time. He even let us sample their short ribs to see what we missed.  I can't say enough good about this place. I'd definitely eat here again.",

    "text": "Go here for anything with pork in it. Everything else will probably be average. We came here for lunch right when it opened and seeing that the interior looked a bit too dark for a lively lunch, decided to sit on the scenic patio overlooking the fountain. We had the pig wings, queso dip, and I had the shrimp tamale as my main entree.  We were first served glasses of water that had strange bits of particulate in it. I'm hoping it was bits of carbon maybe from whatever filtered water was used and not something more insidious. The queso dip was a gigantic size, and served with corn tortilla chips. While I enjoyed the hearty portion I could mainly taste bean and not much chorizo as was advertised in the menu. The pig wings were delicious, covered in a slightly spicy, sticky sweet sauce with tender meat that fell off the bone. I would definitely get the pig wings again.  I wasn't very impressed with the shrimp tamale. It was a beautiful presentation but I didn't like the moat of sauce covering everything. The shrimp were plentiful and had a good grilled flavor but were slightly overcooked. I didn't really like the corn tamale either, which had a texture that was too grainy for me, and too sweet.   Service was OK. The server didn't really seem that enthused to be here but she did provide an adequate amount of service.   I'd probably come here to try some more pork items and to enjoy the patio if it's a nice day, but I'll stay clear of the other items.",

Service was good which is why the 1 star otherwise it would be one! Order the nachos, salsa was good but meat and cheese were cold. We were hungry so at it anyway. I was excited about the tamale but it was not good, small and expensive. 12.00 for one tamale that was VERY small!!! Then there was my brother who is in town with us. He loves tacos and order 3 different kinds. Chicken was dry and cold according to him, and the beef was cold and not good. Again being hungry and not one to complain he ate them and said something to us in the car.  The mahi taco was good he stated. So you might try that if you dare to go here!! My fiance got a pambazo! She said it was good I wouldn't try it and even though she loved that she agreed she would probably not go out of her way to come here. Also seating was very poor we were packed in tighter than sardines at a high top. This is a very bar styled atmosphere and cramped seating was uncomfortable and disruptive to the meal.  Update: we are all in the bathroom the next morning!! DO NOT GO!!!",

In fact on the way in, my wife and I were temped by the garlicky aroma of the Flagship restaurant next door, but we fought the temptation to try their latest venture.  Food is obviously Mexican/southwestern, but with a definite Italian fusion thing going on.  Interesting take, and for our first visit, we wanted more.  I had the shrimp tamale which was astounding.  The cream sauce was unreal, and the shrimp had a seasoning similar to an oregatana.  I left a pic of it here on yelp for others to drool at.  Words cannot do this dish justice.  I wish there was one more piece of shrimp, though, it was so bloody tasty.  Next time I will ask and pay extra, I tells ya!  Both the bartender and server were great, friendly, and knowledgeable about the food.  Should have gotten their names, but they were blond and brunette, respectively.    Wife had a chicken taco which was yummy, as well as the mac and cheese, which was cooked perfectly al dente.  We will be back to try it again, that is for sure.",

Seating is limited so if you go during prime chow hours, be prepared to wait awkwardly at the front door until someone feels guilty for lingering and leaves.    I had the fish tacos which were wonderful seasoned bits of mahi mahi atop a flour tortilla.  Husband had the nacho trough which he quite enjoyed during the meal but he wondered later whether it had given him a headache.    Service was a bit slow but they only had one waitress working the entire restaurant.   The menu is a bit all over the place so between that, the hunks of dead cow in the butcher case that judge you while you eat, there's a bit of culinary schizophrenia happening.    We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and would return.",

We were already late back to work so we had them take it off the bill as it was untouched. The rest of us proceeded to eat our food. It was delicious, although untimely, until my boss CHOMPED ON A PIECE OF GLASS in his sandwich. The rest of us stopped eating, and when we told the employees, we barely got an apology and had to ask twice for them to waive our bill.

We split the guac, the pig wings, and two tacos - short rib and carne asada with the house rice. This was plenty of food. The guac was one of the mediocre items. It had a weird artificial lime flavor... like a cleanser almost. Also, they used pepper in it, which is just plain weird. It was not wonderful. The pig wings were one of the insanely delicious items. They were sooo good! Like the most tender barbeque pork rib with a wonderful glaze.... it, in itself, is worth a return visit. The carne asada taco was one of the mediocre items. It was dry, kind of bland, and nothing I would order again. The short rib tacos were incredible! The short rib was moist, tender, full of flavor. I would get this item again. The house rice was also very good, it is rice with chorizo and pineapple in it.... that is fabulous! I would love to come back here for these few memorable items and to try some new items as well.

The guac was fresh and the chips were seasoned- so yummy!   Lunch was el pastor burrito-4/5 filled with delicious and tender meat. I added side of white rice and clack beans. It was so much food, I took home left overs. Also has the shrimp and corn tamale 5/5! I think I'm going back for this one today. The tamale was perfectly steamed and the shrimp was huge and seasoned soooo well! Again, perfectly cooked. The shrimp sit on top of the tamale which I actually liked better so you know the shrimp is cooked fresh for each order.  This place is near my work do they can expect to see me regularly:)",

The dressings are fantastic and accentuate the food as opposed to overtaking the dish.  Mine was a twist on a Cobb Salad with aged smoked Gouda Cheese and a Jalapeno Ranch dressing. I could depict each flavor component in the dish.   The restaurant is cute and inviting. Not made for large groups but medium wild be fine. Very clean and I love the decor and the differing pig paintings made me smile.  Our service was spot on and she was very attentive and friendly. I give this place two thumbs up and we will be back for sure. We talked all the way to our cars about our dishes.

The ambiance is kind of like a bar but designed to look more homely. It's got a family inviting feel to it with a nice patio to enjoy those great weather days.   Now the food is too awesome here! My go to is the crab stack. It's got so many layers of crab, avocado, mango and deliciousness! It's a must to order. I generally go with the sweet corn shrimp tamale. Huge shrimp on top of one of the best sweet corn tamales you will ever eat. Plus it has this delicious sauce that I could eat everyday of my life. This is another dish that you need to order. The most recent trip I wanted to try out the Cubana and it didn't disappoint. Alot of cubanos are press as a panini, this was more on a torta type of bread which works but the roasted pork was probably some of the best roasted pork I ever had. The roasted pork was one of the most tender and delicious tasting with traffic addition of the ham, mustard and pickle, it was a well put together sandwich. I would recommend this dish also  All around one of my favorite places to eat and it never seems to disappoint. My most recent trip they ran out of crab stacks which was a bummer but I understand cause they're the best. Come out here and enjoy a great meal",

We came here by accident, when we couldn't get into a nearby restaurant.  Oh well, their loss. We started with some very tasty Guacamole and Salsa. It was as good as any I could make, and was almost as good as the Barrio Queen, so Four Stars.   We then ordered our entrees of Stuffed Poblano, Pork Carnitas Burrito and a meal sized Quesadilla.  The stuffed poblano, was the best I've had outside of Santa Fe, the rest was okay.  Though the Queso was a lot better than last week's at Carlos O'Brien. Ugh  So Three and a Half Stars, A-Okay.",

Patio seems like the best seating option at this place, assuming the weather is working out for you. It is really nice with water nearby an oasis of palms, and you pretty much feel separated from the asphalt that is nearby.  I tried the Shrimps with Tamale, very rich but good mix of sweet and savory and the sauce is ultra thick and rich. Not perfection but very good and I was glad i ordered this signature dish for The Blind Pig.   Other options on this menu including the big salad and tasty beer selections make it a good choice for all your discriminating friends.",

Didn't refill my water glass, but that's okay since my wife had a Sangria and didn't touch her water. We started with a delicious Pig Wings. So flavorful and tender. They actually looked like chicken wings. My wife had the Shrimp and Corn Tamale and after the first bite she was in heaven. I had the Adobo Braised Short Ribs with white rice. The beef looked tough but taking a bite, it was cooked just right, not tuff, boneless and the sauce was mild which left your mouth asking where did that little bit of heat come from. We will definitely return",

    "text": "I hope what I am about to write does this gem justice. From start to finish my experience at the Blind Pid was phenomenal and I cannot wait to go back. It's a quaint, almost deceiving, slice of heaven located in a strip mall. The ambiance is lovely, low key and everything you would want from a casual Mexican restaurant. Don't let the modest digs fool you -- the food is beyond amazing!!!!! And, thanks to my 2 year old niece insisting on seeing the kitchen and the chef -- I got to meet Alex, the chef and glanced at the spotless kitchen. It's definitely where the magic happens. They have a fully stocked bar and make a super sized margarita that definitely sets the tone for the sequence of insanely tasty dishes that were about to come from the kitchen.  We started with the crab stack and OMG it's fresh, layered with flavors and knocked out socks off. And, the perfectly crisp and warm might I add chips took it over the edge into euphoria! The crab was delicate, the mango fresh and the avocado creamy and dreamy. And, it sat on this creamy cilantro concoction that was off the charts delicious!!!!!!    Next we had the tamales, topped with spice dusted grilled shrimp. The best tamales I have ever had hands down. And, I eat Mexican food a lot so trust me!!!!!   Next, we had the adobo short rib on a bed of house rice. Wow wow wow!!!! Not sure I have words but I'll try. The sauce was intense, flavorful and authentic!!!! Alex definitely put love into it!  It was falling apart, no knife needed. It melts in your mouth. Incredible!   Greg and Michele were there for our every need -- we found out at the end of the meal they're the owners and could tell how much love and care they put into service, the food and our over all experience. After each course was cleared I could hear Greg going back in the kitchen to cheer on the guys on the line and let them know how amazing the food they produced hit all the right notes!!!  We finished the meal with dessert and couldn't decide between the key lime pie and the brownie so we got both. Sooooo glad we did!!! Some of the best dessert I have ever had. The key lime pie was better than in the keys. Perfection on a plate. Fresh fresh fresh! Tasted like it was made moments before serviced. The Brown was warm and service with ice cream and yellow kiwis. We were told the story of how the recipe was a family secret ... well the secrets out and I cannot wait to go back for another helping of that brownie. It taste like warm fudge and melted with every bite. Dear god it was gooooooddddd!!!!!  You will not regret trying this place -- I bet it will become your go to spot just as it's captured my heart and taste buds. Going back ASAP :)  Thanks for an amazing meal! See you soon!",

Ever since Blind Pig came under new leadership, our favorite waiters and bartenders left, and they changed the menu. They removed some of our favorite entrees and the menu items that they have kept, they have changed. They have also increased their prices, which just doesn't make sense since the quality has decreased. The new owner works as a waiter sometimes and he is never attentive and doesn't remember my family who comes every week. It just isn't worth it to come here anymore.",

And the prices ... whoa, in some cases they nearly doubled. My wife paid $15.95 for a single shrimp tamale. They are way over priced. The place also used to be packed on weekends. Went there on Saturday at 8 and there were 3 tables sitting. The price increase alone is enough to keep me from going back. It's too bad they had to take a great place and ruin it.",

I rolled in with some people I just met at my hotel.  I was hungry and didn't know where to go.  I heard the front desk clerk talking up the Blind Pig to some people and they invited me to join.    The menu had some interesting items.  Not a lot of things I recognized from a traditional Mexican restaurant experiences.  But I love me some short rib so I ordered the tacos.  They were amazing.  Some of the men at my table ordered the short rib entree which I wish I would have ordered because there was more short rib.  They raved about it.  They also make a fabulous margarita.  No mixer or soda in this margarita.  The real thing!!!  Next time I'm in Scottsdale I'm definitely coming back to the Blind Pig.",

    "text": "I have issues. Why else would I be this excited about the arrival of The Blind Pig to Scottsdale? It's a butcher for goodness sake! Yet, I just can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop planning my next visit. It's just that cool and the meat is just that good!   First off, Scottsdale has desperately needed a local butcher shop for quite some time. In the past, I easily put 20+ miles on my car to drive to other butchers around the Valley and every time I did, I wondered when Scottsdale would get one. Now they have one! The Blind Pig is owned by the family who owns Uncle Sal's and the Side Door. The Blind Pig is their newest addition and it's a great one! The meat is fresh, preservative-free and delicious. They have everything from sausages and deli meat, to prime meat cuts and boneless pork chops. It's a meat-lover's paradise. If you're not sold yet, read this: it's also a full-service restaurant and a full-service bar which means that you can stop in for lunch or dinner, grab a cocktail and take some meat home on your way out. They also offer to-go beer and wine so you can grab a beverage or two for home!   The environment is very homey and Fido's are welcome! They have a spacious patio and welcome any dogs. I also learned that they sell fresh meat for dogs! This is a one-stop-shop for all products pertaining to meat and I also enjoyed their marinades. I purchase a boneless pork chop, burger meat and a sausage... all for under $11. The prices are pretty reasonable for the quality of meat. I also purchase the bacon infused marinade which was incredible! I marinaded the boneless pork chop in it and died and went to bacon-heaven with every bite.   In summary, this place is a must-visit for meat-lovers.",

The inside feels more like a bar than anything else, with TVs, bar stools, and a friendly staff.  They have a beautiful patio for when the weather is nice.  Both my friend and I got tacos and really enjoyed them.  I got the Short Rib Tacos, and for the price, I was amazed.    I think this is a great choice for a cheap lunch, especially when you can sit outside. Nothing is more than around $12 or $13, and for the area, that's rare.  Enjoy!",

It's like a giant 1/4lb \"chicken\" wing - mostly meat on one bone.  It came glazed in a chipotle sauce that was nicely charred on a grill with a cilantro ranch dipping sauce.  Lip smackin' good!!  Then we had White Cheddar Mac & Cheese, Adobo Braised Short Rib, Al Pastor Tacos and Key Lime Pie.  It was all amazing except then taco I would give it a 3.  Everything else was so tasty once I had the taco, it was just not up to par with everything else.  I'm excited to come back to try some other items on the menu, and have more Pig Wings of course!",

The guacamole was not very flavorful, the rice was cooked nicely but lacked taste, and the \"refried\" beans were not. They were, rather, more akin to a moderately thick bean soup - put them on a plate and they ran over the whole plate. My burrito was OK - the meat was tasty, but it was assembled more like a wrap with all ingredients starkly separate so it was difficult to get all ingredients in a single bite. My wife's al Pastor tacos weren't particularly flavorful and the pineapple was actually sour. Even the chips served with the guacamole were thick, tough, and saltless (if that's a word). I would not go back, and, if you've read any of my other reviews, if incredibly uncommon.",

I've been here several times, twice to eat and probably 6-8 times to get fresh cuts of meat for home preparation. The guys (and girls!) behind the counter are incredibly helpful, and will go beyond just helping you pick great meats. Last time I picked up some awesome scallops, the gentleman that helped me also suggested some preparations and the correct amount of time required to cook them. (I'm an admitted novice...) They also do some great specials and have a loyalty program, if you check the business cards on the counter. (Bonus: Use the belly app to accrue even more rewards!)  As for dining in, I suggest sitting on the patio. During our last visit, the waitress was very attentive, and the ambiance was casual and fun. We split some fantastic nachos (seriously, my favorite in Scottsdale) and I had a great salad to help assuage my cheese-y guilt! The food was great, as always, and the only complaint we had was that we never saw the oysters we ordered. We were full enough from the nachos, and since we weren't charged for them, we let it go... but we were looking forward to giving them a shot!  All in all, it's a great place. Perfect for a casual dinner, catching up with friends! (Pick up some great meats to take home while you're there!)",

Within a couple of minutes we were greeted and received our waters and a Paloma Fresca a few after.  I'm in the industry so I tend to be observant when out to dinner. They are quite unorganized and inefficient  (they are still using paper tickets rather than a POS system for one).  When we received our drinks we ordered chips, salsa and guacamole, which came almost 15 minutes later (they ran out of ramekins for the salsa ).  Before we received our appetizer we ordered our entrees.  Needless to say we waited almost 1.5 hours for them to never arrive. I was really looking forward to the shrimp tamales and ceviche based on rave reviews. Tables around us were waiting ten plus minutes to get greeted, standing up and getting their own menus. And another couple that came in a half an hour after us received their food. Not to mention the table next to us who left waiting when they came after us as well.  As I said, I'm in the industry. My previous employer was a popular Mexican restaurant so I know Cinco de Mayo can be hectic.  My patience ran too thin and we asked for our check before our food came when apparently,  \"our food was out next\" 15 minutes ago.  I'm giving an extra star because they comped our drinks and app. If I do ever come back it will be a Monday afternoon.",

    "text": "So the food was pretty good! I had the fish tacos and enjoyed them. My friend liked her meal, too. Which is a bummer because...  The service, was weird! Our waitress was super pushy and asked me if I was ready to order a drink like 4 times in a matter of 10/15 minutes. I told her sorry, that I've been talking (catching up with a friend) and haven't had a chance to look yet and she pointed out that I basically might want to stop talking and look because they were closing in an hour. Rude!  At the end when our check came I asked her if we could get separate checks and she said they can't do that, but that we could split it. So I wrote down the dollar amount (to the penny) that each of us were going to pay. Both amounts ended in something like .16 cents and .18 cents. I explained who was paying what and she tells us that she can't do cents either and instead has to round it to the nearest five or something...?!? WTF? So she said it would be rounded up to .20 cents instead. So you can't charge me .18, but you can charge me .20??? I've never in my life heard of such a thing!!! I don't even care about the extra cents, its the principal of the matter. And as a business if you're having technical difficulties (or whatever) you shouldn't charge the customer the extra cents, no matter how little, it's not my problem! The proper thing to do would be to take a hit and round it down (if anything) and get your crap together! Ugh, the whole thing was frustrating. Plus, she was so rude about it!  Listen up: If they charged 200 people a day for a month an extra .05 cents because of this \"issue\" or \"incapability\" they would take home an extra $300 a month!! Something seems super fishy here. Just sayin.  Anyways, I'd say give them a go because the food was good, but if service is shotty or weird things happen don't say I didn't warn you :/",

This is a non-traditional Mexican place AND BUTCHER, and the food is absolutely indescribable, and you know from my other reviews, I am a food snob - particularly with this type of cuisine.  So reasonably priced it is silly.  We started with the Pig Wings (mini pork shanks) and guacamole with chips, and the freshness screams off the plate.  Three tacos and the shrimp and corn tamale later, and I was weeping with joy.  Super fresh ingredients, combined like a well tuned orchestra; and the sweet and spice in the tamale was literally the best tamale I have ever eaten.  I do not know how they get away with such reasonable prices.  The place is small, but not crowded or loud.  It is so clean, you feel like you could eat off the table or floor - but not too sterile!  It's dimly lit, but not too dark; and the staff seem to really enjoy their job!  They are attentive, friendly, thoughtful, and greet and visit with diners like family!  The butcher was closed, but I have heard good things!  Seriously, this place is an absolute don't miss.  Next time, I want to eat outside, on the super-inviting patio with the fountain.  While the view might only be a parking lot, it is truly charming.",

    "text": "So, I recently discovered this place and it suddenly became my favorite Mexican place in town. It has a weird name, so I always thought it was BBQ or something. I've been back a few times and bring friends. Amy, is usually our server, and is hilarious and takes good care of us. I liked that she knew my name after only coming there twice. Most places in Old Town, people couldn't give two shits...this was a nice change.  You can sit outside on the patio,which is relaxing. My favorite things are the $7 Patron margaritas. I always get two, because, well, I'm a lush. The bean dip is amazing, but my favorite's the short rib tacos with House Rice. I tried some of my friends' shrimp tamales and macaroni and they were amazing and rich. This is the one of the best kept secrets in the area. So go! Like tonight!",

First impression is it is quaint and contains Kobe beef meat shop inside (yummm). We chose to sit outside because it was nice out. There is a water fixture that adds to the ambiance. Our waiter was super nice and the food came so fast. We ordered some chips with salsa and guac. Great chunks of avocado and the salsa was addicting (the green was had a nice kick to it). I ordered the combo of two tacos and a side of beans or rice. I chose the al pastor and the el pollo and a side of beans. I don't even know where to begin! The chicken taco had great flavor but the al pastor was to die for. It was perfectly cooked with complimentary toppings like pineapple that just burst with flavor. The beans were probably the best flavored refried beans I have ever had and it was a large portion! With the four of us having full meals and an appetizer we only spent 42 dollars. What a great place! I will be back very soon :)",

My friend loves it so much he has to force himself to try other menu items for variety. Adobo short ribs are tender and yummy over the house rice. They didn't skimp on the 'shrooms in their Mushroom quesadilla. It was a portion which satisfied my husband. I knew the torta would have more bread than I wanted but the presentation and taste were worthy of ordering again on another visit. Salsas served with chips were tasty; the red had just the right heat. They are located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. we go at off peak times to be sure to get a patio seat.",

    "text": "I can't lie...this was amongst one of the best meals I have ever had and my waistline will indicate I have dined plenty to come to this conclusion.  The margaritas are made with Patron and made with fresh lime juice and agave and served up as I like.  We started with the guac and chips.   Fresh and yummy!  And the homemade salsas served on the side really were superb. We then split the pork wings.  I have never had anything like this and am sad I live too far away to get these on a regular basis.  They were so tender and the flavors were wonderful.   It was truly a gift from a blind pig. We then split the braised short rib and mac and cheese.  This set us over the edge but were happy to be pushed to the edge. The short rib was so tender and flavorful.  Very well done sauce as well.  The mac and cheese was better than most upscale steakhouses that offer this dish as a side.  We were completely blown away by the quality of food and the yummy drinks.  Being from OC that meal would have cost us well over $150 BUT with 8 drinks (we are lushes) and all that food it came to around $86.  I AM NOT SAYING raise your prices Blind Pig, I'm saying I am thankful for your food, drinks, service and prices.  Don't change a thing...Oh and PS: come to OC...........NOW!!!!!!!",

At that point I just asked for the check because I wanted to leave. The only reason why I am giving three stars is because the girl and the food was so good the first time we went. The two guys serving was too worried about the large party next to us and didn't give any thought to my son and I. Would not recommend with service like that. Not sure if we will be back.",

There is an up charge for this, versus most places which just drop off bottomless chips and salsa, but the guacamole was handmade and so are the salsas.  Good stuff and for $6, not complaining too loud, as guacamole is always extra no matter where you go - chips were refilled at no charge.  I prefer them fresh and hot...these were maybe out of bag, but they were decent.  I did the pick any two taco combo.  I am a real fan of the crispy taco...these were okay, but not the best I've had.  The real find was the Short Rib Tacos - man oh man...I wish I had two of these - they were that good.  They have a few other specialities, but you won't be disappointed if you order one of these.  The choice was rice or beans.  I picked the rice and it was also tasty, with a hint of pineapple and some other goodies mixed in.  We used the rest of the $6 salsa on top of the rice.  Service was promote and efficient.  I would eat here again.",

Indoor and outdoor seating is available. Both the waitstaff and bartenders are incredibly friendly. The owner even stopped by the table to check in on us. Are usually have the Al Pastor tacos, but tonight I tried the pig wings. Just enough kick in the sauce to give your taste buds a treat. The pig wings are slow cooked the day before then glazed and placed on the grill prior to serving. Listed as an appetizer these two wings are healthy portion for a small dinner. Served with Rob vegetables such as carrots, cucumbers, radishes, and red onion. The jalapeno dipping sauce is the icing on the cake! I started with chips salsa and guacamole and had to stop myself before I filled up and didn't have room for my main course. The music wasn't too loud the crowd wasn't rowdy and the prices were reasonable. If you haven't tried this place you're missing out! If you haven't tried recently I highly recommend you come in again.",

The bartender was super cool and threw this frozen pineapple my way again can't wait for tomorrow I will be back.  Thinking about putting my house up for sale to be closer to this place   So I tired this place two days late the wings were still awesome. I had the short rib tacos and it was the best taco I have ever eaten. Also tried the chicken  flauta that was full of flavor. Usually you just taste the outside but the chicken was moist and juicy.

We shared a baked potato with chorizo and cheese for an appetizer. Admittedly, not my pick, but so glad we did! What a nice surprise. Salad was huge and tasty as well! And not drowned in heavy dressing. Had the street tacos and those were very good with a generous portion of the meat filling. Not the usual one tablespoon of meat you get in a typical street taco.  Very above average.  Planning my next visit for this Friday as there are so many items on the menu that I want to try.  Great outdoor seating as well.  Atmosphere",

This is a small restaurant that I expected to be a sandwich shop. Fortunately I was wrong. It's a Mexican food restaurant that hits the mark.  The service was great.  Even though I was by myself and the restaurant was fairly full they had my order taken and food served quickly and effectively.  Quickly, my drink order was taken and I was served almost immediately. And effectively in that I ordered chips and salsa and a sandwich at the same time, but the chips and salsa came out way before the sandwich did which let me enjoy as opposed to having a bunch of food thrown in the table all at once.  This is a darkly lit small restaurant with nice touches and very clean. It's on the southside of Scottsdale and you would feel comfortable taking clients there as well as your family. They got a wonderful outdoor seating area and indoor seating area and about seven seats around the bar. Nothing feels cluttered, it just feels great.  The food was really good. Chips salsa and guacamole for six dollars served on the attractive tray but not too big for just one person. OK maybe a little too big for just one person but that was OK with me. I ended up having a pork Carnitas and slaw sandwich.  It had lots of flavor and was very tasty. I didn't eat anything that wasn't really good.  Overall highly recommend it. Why does it only have four stars? Because I reserve five stars for restaurants I visit multiple times. I would expect to be editing this one to five stars in the very near future.",

When you tell them you haven't visited before, they give you good useful information about the menu, options, sides, and the like.  The only down-side was that my wife specifically asked about one dish being spicy or not, and she was told it wasn't.  But she's very sensitive to spicy foods and found that it was too much for her.  However they offered to take it off the tab as soon as she mentioned it.  I'm a salsa fiend, and found them to be far better than average.  Prices were reasonable.  Not super cheap, not expensive.",

We sat and ordered the queso dip and green chili mac n cheese. So so so so good!  I ordered the chorizo pizza and my husband had the cane aside burrito. Delicious!

    "text": "The Blind Pig is certainly an interesting establishment.  A butcher shop, restaurant and a bar all rolled into one business.  I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around the concept.  But no matter... no matter that my big scientific brain can't get itself wrapped around the idea.  The food that I tasted and the drinks that I had were yummy.  I stopped in here one evening to have a quick dinner.  The restaurant is small and it was almost full, so I sat at the bar.  Discovered that this restaurant/butcher shop is a member of the Uncle Sal's/Side Door family of businesses.  I also like it when I go to a restaurant and the regulars are chatty.  (this place is new and it already had some folks who say they'd been there every week since it opened)  I'm sitting alone, so it was great.  Just about everyone in the restaurant engaged in the conversation.    The ladies waiting at the bar were extremely helpful with my selection.  I wanted to taste something prepared with the bacon infused marinade that they sell at the butcher counter.  Unfortunately, nothing on the menu is prepared with that.  However, the bartender was nice enough to suggest the closest item on the menu to that kind of taste.  That item would be the pig wings.  Yummy, what an amazing dish.  I think pig wings are starting to take flight!  The wings were flavorful, juicy and succulent.  They had a nice BBQ flavor to them, yet were not too saucy for my liking.  I also ordered their version the Mosow mule.  That was a 3 star drink.    I did not take home anything from th butcher shop.  The meat from the butcher shop is from the acclaimed Hobe Meats of Phoenix, also owned by the same owners.  Perhaps when I want a standing rib roast, I will check here the next time.    There is a large area out front for seating as well.  this is a solid place to go to after work or a baseball game during the nice spring evenings.",

We made a reservation for 6 and sat on the patio, which was nice. It did take a while to get our food, but the waitress updated us regularly.  I'd go back just because the prices are great for a Scottsdale restaurant.",

    "text": "I seem to have a thing for pigs... in this case , she claims to be blind! So what. This swine has amazing taste , ambience and service ! Just like her Uncle Sal, next door . On a recent visit with a group of friends I have to admit that the name threw me off: Blind Pig , you say? Well! It doesn't sound Mexican! Do not judge a cantina by its namesake. Or a pig by her ummm ethnicity ?? After all, Uncle Sal is Italian! Upon entering, we were seated in the corner of this rather small, but cute and quaint place and promptly greeted by our waitress who gave us ideas on drinks and the once over on the specials. She was super patient with our loud group, ( seriously .. we were noisy.) My drink was the Paloma Fresca  : a light , citrusy margarita type cocktail  , with the buzz of a grapefruit spritz. It was good, light and refreshing. I ordered the Crab/Mango/Avocado  Stack. Okay. Mind. Blown. For $9.. this very robust stack of just what it describes! It was more than enough to share amongst us and still have not eaten it all!! LOADS of crab !! Being from California , I can appreciate how pricey crab recently has been . I was in shock at how good it was ; fresh and how much was on this appetizer for such a low price! My entree : I had a tough time deciding because the menu is full of really , good snd inexpensive fresh items ! I went with the Shrimp Tamale as my entree because it was different. It comes as one tamale with a few shrimp on top and a creamy sauce. It's rich! Don't think because it's only one you won't get enough ,  as you will! My husband ordered the Guacamole and Salsa combo to start and again: Soooo good and enough to share ! Cheap beers; a great wine list; great margs and amazing food. The waitress was so friendly throughout our night here with our loud table and our groups indecisiveness and all of us asking so many questions of her ! She never lost it! Kudos to her! Our dinner group is a bit much , at times!! Can't wait for another reason to visit this cute blind swine ...and her nice patio before the hot summer hits!",

Then one day in August we ordered the tamales and the flavor of the tamale was way off so we asked about the difference and they explained to us that their vendor didn't have the corn maize and apologized. It was only an apology we also left our phone number for the manager to call us back but they never did. We decided to wait a couple of months to go back. We even called to ask  about the maize. They confirmed it was the old vendor but once again it didn't hold up to the once amazing tamale we went in WEEKLY for. We are disappointed and no longer go back to our once favorite place",

    "text": "Food was good. Not outstanding, but good! I got the tamale with the shrimp and cheese sauce and I was impressed but it was pretty rich! The rice had some pineapple in it which was interesting but good. Added to the richness of the meal. The beans were just, beans.  They don't split checks, first off. I have worked in the industry for years and it just grinds my gears when restaurants don't split checks. I've done my fair share of splitting checks and it's just not that hard. I come to pay good money and relax and not have to stress out about my bill and making sure we all pay evenly. It shouldn't be that hard to split checks to keep your customers from getting frustrated. They do not sell their rice and beans as a \"half and half\" option either. So if you'd like to add rice and beans to your meal, you are paying $5 for the rice and $4 for the beans. $9 for rice and beans?! That seems a little outrageous when my actual meal was only $12.   Our server was hardly attentive and wasn't the friendliest lady on the planet. Our food came out about 20-25 minutes after we ordered which isn't too bad but it took a lot to get her to check on us.   I was so pumped for The Blind Pig and I can't say that I won't be back. I just would say that it isn't at the top of my list for Mexican grub in the area.  Another interesting note is that a lady at the bar was yelling how she was leaving and the bartender asked her if she was okay to drive and she said no but she was going to drive anyway. She was LOUD and obviously intoxicated. That's concerning that she could just leave and nobody do anything about her driving in that condition. Shameeee.",

It was the strange but cool combo of butcher shop, bar and Mexican Restaurant.  This place is evidently affiliated with Uncle Sal's Italian Restaurant which is right across the courtyard.  We have eaten at Uncle Sal's and it was delish, so I determined I wanted to eat here.  It was a beautiful day, 80 degrees in January while the rest of the country is in the deep freeze, and I wanted lunch.  It was so beautiful I decided to sit on the patio.  Started with a Cosmo which was strong and yummy.  Then ordered the  short rib taco minus the red onion, which included 2 taco's and I chose the house rice as a side.  Food came out quickly and was simply scrumptious!!!!   The rice especially was tasty as it had chorizo, garlic, cilantro and pineapple.  The taco's too were very yummy!  I had a very attentive (but unobtrusive) server.  This is a great place, and hope to return someday when visiting Scottsdale.",

    "text": "If you haven't been then ya just gotta! This is THE most incredibly delicious food ever!!! Not your typical Mexican fare which we love, mind you. It's a small place packing a BIG wallop. Your taste buds will thank you. I'm literally moaning & groaning with every bite! We've been a number of times & truly have not had anything that wasn't memorable! If we lived closer I would be a frequent flyer for sure. The service is prompt & friendly & beer is cold! Brrrrr!! The presentation is photo worthy. Portions plentiful & while I expected to take some home, forget that! My hubby, daughter & I split 2 entrees which was more than ample. We had  the mushroom quesadillas and avocado bruschetta. The sauces are AHmazing! And they put the hotter stuff on the side for my family as I am a wimp! Charming patio to soak up the cooler temps & a mini splash pad adds just the right atmosphere considering you are in a parking lot but next to Uncle Sal's another prize winning favorite!",

You can also get 2 tacos and a side of beans or rice for $5.00 and a la carte tacos for $3-4 each. Although I stuck to diet coke which they serve in a 20 oz bottle I did see several customers having a very health pour of wine.  The butcher shop sells quality US Prime beef, but you have to pay for quality. If you are comfortable with US Choice beef sold by the chain stores than the price of US Prime beef will be a shock. T-bone and ribeye Prime beef steaks are $19.99/lb. They also have a selection of chicken, lamb and fish.  TBG is definitely worth a stop.",

    "text": "With only one visit under my belt, I can't rave about this place, but I will say it's definitely better than average. Which is why it barely gets 4 stars....    The vegetarian options were pretty slim, but they did have a very tasty mushroom quesadilla, and I really enjoyed the chips, salsa and guacamole. I just wish the chips and salsa was complementary.  Unfortunately, with only one vegetarian option, it doesn't entice me to keep coming back. This really is too bad, because we live right around the corner.  Hottie said his spare rib taco was delicious but the carne asada was just so-so.    We are huge fans of all the Uncle Sals concepts, their food and service is always good. This is no exception. The Blind Pig has great potential, despite the fact that it didn't blow our minds on the first try!  The only thing I don't understand is how the butcher shop ties in with the Mexican menu.   What to expect?  Well like Side Door, it's more of a neighborhood bar feel, nothing fancy.  It will be packed on a weekend night, so prepare to sit at the bar, outside or wait. It's a very small place.",

    "text": "So, I've been here once with definite plans to come back again. The outside area is darling, although will probably be too hot in the coming months. The staff was all courteous and very attentive. But the food...oh the food.  I wanted to go here a long time ago but was shy about it because I saw it was a butcher shop as well and I had a totally different picture in mind. So one day I was like well screw it I need Mexican now, so made my boyfriend meet me there. Ahh, we got the chips and salsa. It is so hard to find good chips and salsa here. I enjoyed each flavor, tomatillo is my favorite but I wasn't so sure at this locations as the flavors in their red was on point. I got the torta, him the short rib. My dish was great! The bread was soft, I wasn't crazy about the flavor of the bread (I mean it's white bread, I guess there isn't a whole lot of that anyways) otherwise it was good! Except there were pickled something I don't remember now because my phone was stolen with the photo on it - pickled anything except pickles go off my list. So I took them off. The short rib was tasty. So tender and flavorful. It was put on top of white rice...which I thought was weird, and that was all. So rice and meat? A mans dish (sorry stereotyping) but all the same good. I've had a patient tell me they have the best house rice in town. I will go back to try.  If I remember correctly...the menu was good, but not a huge selection like some might be used to if you tend to frequent places like Garcia's, Chevy's or whatever the heck places there are here.  Anyways...go. And get the chips and salsa.  I might mention that the same owners own Sal's next door, I should write a review for them too, so good. And around the corner is a smaller bar/wine bar of sorts that I want to say is the side door but I don't remember...haven't been there but if they have same quality it is def a go try.",

They were the worst tacos I've ever had. There were 2 flour tortillas  with carne asada and shredded cabbage on top. My husband did not like his carne asada burrito either.  Meat was like little bullets of spicy meat. The margaritas were OK but nothing special. The one good thing was the key lime pie which was outstanding. That's why I'm giving this restaurant one star but not worth going back.",

The avocado bruschetta is little more than guacamole on toast. I had the short rib tacos, the meat was very bland and overcooked. My girlfriend had the shrimp tamales, which she said were too sweet and the sauce was too creamy. To top it all off, I find it in poor taste that the check would be brought out in a book with the Uncle Sal's logo on it.

Sat outside in the patio which was a good size and spaced out well so that we didn't feel cramped. The menu had a variety of choices all based around an upscale Mexican theme with some unique food combinations.   The food: started with oysters on the half shell and guacamole. The oysters were fresh with sides of horseradish and a red chili sauce which I mistakenly took for cocktail sauce. The guacamole was very good and fresh. For entrees we ordered the Mexican pizza and pork nachos. The pizza was topped with a very tasty chorizo, which was made in house in the butcher shop, along with pickled onions and cabbage. The pizza was very good and we were pleasantly surprised at how the favors combined. The pork nachos were also very good although very basic which is in no way a negative but we wished we had ordered one of the more imaginative items on the menu.   The staff: only two servers covering the patio and the inside seating area but did not feel neglected at all. There were several busboys that stopped to refill drinks and generally helped the servers in a complimentary way.   I enjoyed this experience and can't wait to go back. If you live in the area or are visiting you should definitely try it.",

The carne asada and al pastor are also wonderful. The guac is acado-riffic and the fresh, limey, just-the-right-amount-of-everything, ceviche is going to be the absolute perfect meal come summer.

I ordered the chicken taco plate with a side of their House Rice. The chicken was dry and flavorless and the salsas weren't the best either. The guacamole was average, I've had better, I've had worse. The rice it was great but then as I started eating it, the cumin flavor overpowered everything else! My boyfriend ordered some sort of chicken torta which was \"really good\" I don't know because he wouldn't let me try it, but it looked very appealing. It came with a slaw salad and I did try that and wasn't impressed it was basically cut cucumber, radishes, and carrots in oil and pepper.Another thing is that they do have a lot of regulars (our server knew almost everyone's name) but in turn kind of ignored us Overall this place was OK but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.",

Brought a headhunter and his team here for a work-related (aka:  Please hire me!!) dinner and they raved and raved about the food.  Excellent vibe, service, and the bartender was extremely patient with our creative ideas regarding cocktails.",

He dumped water on us twice and spilled our chips before they were brought to the table. He kept disappearing into the bathroom instead of grabbing our bill too, so it made for an unfortunate experience.",

The food was ordinary and over spiced.  The service was  excellent, and the place has real possibilites.  Need to expand the menu from the mexican flavor.",

They are friendly, delicious, and worth trying again and again. I am confused about the reviewers who gave less than four or five stars. The service is outstanding and the food is excellent!",
