    "text": "Excellent food, great decor. Impossible to find parking, though. You can valet, or risk parking across the street (which signs forbid).  My roommate likes the burgers with the pretzel bun. They are really good. You have to ask for them now, since they aren't on the menu anymore.  The waitress charged me twice as much tip as what I put on the receipt (40% instead of 20%). I called once and was told that it would be taken care of within two weeks. Nothing. Called again. This time they tracked down the receipt and verified that I'd been overcharged. They refunded half the tip back to my credit card. As far as I know no one else in my group was overcharged. Keep your receipts and verify that you're charged properly.",

    "text": "From what I've heard, The Vig is quite the hot spot for bronzed local youngsters to collaborate over food, fun, and the occasional dabble in over-imbibing on Sunday Funday. While I can't say I've had the opportunity to day drink in this lovely venue, I can attest that they don't do a bad job with the food + fun part.  Popped in last night for a little post-work snack, and it's pretty clear that the place is a veritable who's who with enough good looking people milling about to to fill an auditorium of extras for the set of Bring It On 3 (was there even a pt. 2?).   In addition to smiling 20-somethings with Adonis DNA, the food was also pretty interesting and had options for just about every type of eater (carnivorous, health conscious, vegan, et al.). Because I've been on a bit of a plant kick as of late, I went with the Vigan (very clever working in the name of the establishment with the sandwich itself), and while I did have to ask to remove the Mozzarella cheese to make it a truly vegan entree, the sauteed portabella mushrooms, squash, red peppers and caramelized onions sandwiched between soft, rectangular focaccia with a side of onion rings was enough to leave me satisfied while wading in unknown dining waters. They also featured a pretty impressive 5-spice edamame appetizer, but their guacamole left a little to be desired. I take my whipped avocado seriously being that I hail from the avocado capital of the world, and while it's much like pizza in that even bad guacamole is still pretty good, it certainly fell somewhere towards the bottom end of the bland spectrum.  On a nice night in Phoenix, something I experience very, very rarely in San Francisco, I can't imagine there are many better places that offer up a sprawling patio like theirs to soak up a warm evening in the city. In the immortal words of Charlie Sheen, \"Winner!\"",

    "text": "Yummmmm! I had a deal chicken deal for this place, os the BF and I gave it a try this afternoon for linner (lunch/dinner). The place is cute inside... has that modern feel. I ordered the carne asada on a potato pancake and he got the hot chick sandwich with sweet potato fries. We also split a side salad. The salad was good, it tasted very fresh and the balsamic dressing was creamy and delicious. The carne asada was sooo good! Wow! The meat was very tender, I was able to cut it with a butter knife, and it had a great flavor of the combo of guac, spicy tomato sauce, pico de gallo, and cotija cheese. Then you add in a potato pancake and it is just a flavor explosion in your mouth. It was sweet, savory, spicy, creamy, and crunchy all at the same time. It was pretty awesome. The hot chick sandwich was also very delicious. It was smokey because it has a smokey cheese, but it also tasted really fresh from the veggies and the chicken was juicy. Overall it was a very good meal. I'll be back, especially to try the awesome 5$ burgers on monday and good looking happy hour.   PS I have been by there at night on weekends to try to get a drink and it is super crowded... it's probably fun, but not my scene.",

    "text": "So we went here on Monday to celebrate another milestone in my sweetheart's life. The staff there is awesome and even changed the channel for us to catch a little Monday Night Football as we did our unedited (and OH so funny) version of \"Oh My God What Is S/He Wearing, Volume 2\".   I am a BIG fan of their Thai Sweet Chili Hot Vings. Those get 4.5 stars easily!  We also had the edamame with their signature spice rub (very yummy, but towards the end it was a teensy bit *greasy* for my taste), the flatbread pizza w/ tandoori chicken, and the banana-nut bread pudding w/ ice cream.    I wasn't very impressed with the bread pudding, don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but I didn't think it was very flavorful, and I'm always on the lookout for the perfect one. (*note* If there is even the HINT of a raisin in the bread pudding, I will not go near it. I like raisins, some of my best friends are raisins, or something to that effect...just not in my bread *giggle*)   I love the atmosphere here, it is a GREAT place to do some people watching, the patio is awesome, although I refuse to sit on ANY patio between July and September here...I'm already hot-blooded, I don't need to be reheated in any shape or fashion!   Great place, great atmosphere, I'm a fan.",

One hour and half to get a table at a bar/tavern place is no Bueno. I loved the band though. The patio is very pretty if you can get into it and find a seat/table. The bathroom situation is not good. There are only two stalls. Two women were brawling and getting into it when I visited. I really thought there was going to be a fight.  Alarming! It brought me back to my college days. lol--Also, I am not sure I like Valet parking. I am not cheap but three bucks ( plus tip of course) for Valet parking is Ridiculous! This is Phoenix where most Valets are non existent or free.  I did think all the staff members were very nice though and most of the non bathroom visiting patrons were very nice.  The food was okay but nothing to die over and pricey for what you get. I gave it three stars for the staff and band. It is really more like a two.",

    "text": "The Vig is a kick ass bar in Central Phoenix and one of my most favorite places to go.  So, what makes The Vig so special....  Beer- Awesome selection of draft beers such as Stella and other great imports. Their bottled beer selection is also very good with the classic domestics along with a dozen or so top notch imports.  Wine- Surprisingly good wine selection with a good mixture of whites and reds. The wine list is plentiful in both quality of the wines and quantity to choose from.  Food- The Vig features a very unique and tasty menu. If you're looking for something light to snack on while you eat, the appetizer menu is great. Some of my favorite appetizers are the \"Five Spice Edamame\", \"16th Street Tacos\", \"Smoked Salmon\", \"Crabmeat and Artichoke Dip\", \"The Not So Nachos\", and the \"Seoul Sliders\". The \"Smoked Salmon\" and \"Seoul Sliders\" are unlike anything you've ever had and the \"Not So Nachos\" have the most amazing combination of ingredients.  If you're a little hungrier and want to try a regular menu item, The Vig has some awesome choices. The \"Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake\" and \"Gumbo Vig Vig\" are both phenomenal.   The signature feature of The Vig is their large patio area. The patio features a separate bar, large fireplaces to help you warm up during cold nights, and a bocce ball court. They also have live bands from time to time.  Great drink and food selections, along with an awesome ambience, give The Vig a five star rating.",

Probably the worst customer service in Arizona. It doesn't matter what day of the week or time of day I go. Busy or slow, hot or cold, I can't believe how poorly this place treats it's customers. It's almost like they think it's a privilege to drink there. I try the place about once every couple months and it has become a game with our group of friends to see how long it will take to get service and how many times our waitress will roll her eyes at us. The place is like spaghetti-o's...you forget how much you hate it so you remind yourself a couple times a year.",

    "text": "Awful!  First, let me start by saying, I have waited nearly a week to cool down and write this.  In addition, I have worked in the restaurant industry for over six years.  I have cocktailed, managed, waited in fine dining and bartended.  This place is totally overrated, they need to shut down, hire new staff, and start over.    I went here last Friday night with some girlfriends for my birthday.  From the minute I walked in, I knew it was going to be a bad experience.  My party had already arrived and been sat, but I didn't know where and no thanks to the retarded hostesses that failed to greet me, took me 10 minutes just to find my party in the giant mess.  The place was WAY too crowded, the staff couldn't even get around and their sections were clearly too big for them. Once I found my friends on the patio, which is lovely, it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us, and then another 10 for her to come back and take our drink order.  She then arrived with an appetizer my friends had ordered previous to my arrival but failed to bring silverware or plates.  Well, the spinach dip looked good, not sure how it tasted because by the time she remembered, it was cold.  After this it took another good 15 minutes just to order dinner and I figured I better get a drink in while I had the chance.  Food arrived, by now we actually had eating utensils.  The food was OK, nothing spectacular.  I had the shrimp appetizer and hummus, friends had the chicken sandwich, sweet potatoe fries and a cheese quesadilla (not many veggie options), oh and they charged her $9 for it.  The food was nothing to write home about.  After our meal was finished was when things got really bad.    A woman came up and asked for one of our chairs, we told her someone was sitting there, and her response was, \"I just don't understand where all of our f-ing chairs went\".  My immediate reaction was 1) you work here? 2) did you really just talk to a guest that way? and 3) I don't give a rats @$$ where your chairs are, stop interupting my birthday dinner and move along, that is not a problem for us to solve.  She started to step away, look around, and then had the audacity to return to the table, demand the chair from us and continue to argue with me.  I told her that my friend was in the restroom, she was still sitting there, which should have been evident by the fact that her dirty plate (along with all of ours) was still on the table, and her purse was in the chair and I demanded to speak to a manager.  Needless to say, she went away in a huff.    At this point we decided it was time to leave.  Waited another 10-15 minutes for the check, only to have a birthday brownie and candle arrive as I was standing up to leave.  Where was that 20 minutes ago when we were finished with dinner?  Oh, and by the way, bad waitress, you took all of my silverware away.  At this point I told the waitress about all of the issues, the manager never did appear, maybe they don't have one, it sure would explain a lot.  She did offer to comp one of our appetizers, but at this point I didn't care, she had already charged us our bill!  To top it all off, as I was leaving, the hostess and wine steward/manager/not sure but he was in a suit, were having a playful little fight in which they were slapping each others butts and bending over....great first impression, and last might I add, in the entry way.  After the girl almost slapped me I politely excused myself and walked around her to exit the place, NEVER to come back.    There are so many better places in the valley to go: Postino, Chelsea's, Radio Milano, Portlands, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, Houston's, Merc Bar, Zen 32, Tarbell's, City Hall, Rokerji, Phoenix City Grill, Sierra Bonita, etc., all within a few miles, why would I bother coming to this yuppie place ever again?  Needless to say, the service was HORRIBLE and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it.  Oh, and the people that go here: I might as well stay up in North Scottsdale, it's the same yuppie, \"I'm so important\"/30K millionaire crowd that has taken over what used to be the great city of Scottsdale.  It's sad, I really wanted to like this place and it has the potential to be fabulous...if they just start over.  Don't waste your time or your money.",

I was thrilled to see we were hitting happy hour so all the martinis were $5 a piece (awesome). Now I have not had the food here but the atmosphere was great. There was a nice mellow DJ accompanied by a trombone player and it really set a nice vibe. The couches out on the patio were spacious and comfy and I could picture myself spending a few relaxing evenings here with friends when the weather gets cooler. Granted it is a slight cheesy atmosphere with the cougars and all but what bars aren't (and I would prefer watching cougars than drunk college jocks any day). The drinks were cheap the music was great. People complain about the valet, but you can park across the street and save yourself the $5 bucks. I think I'll check it out for dinner tonight the wings and burger seem to get great reviews.",

That being said, I have been there for lunch over 30 times so I feel I have a good grasp of this place on that particular day of the week. But  I have heard that the nights are pretty fun and Sundays 1/2 price Vino is pretty stellar.  The Vig is minimalist and modern which is clean and pleasing to my eye. The bar is nice and long and is (wo) manned by the Lovely Susan. She is one of the valley's classiest and most engaging barkeeps. Jimmy, the congenial owner, is typically shaking hands and verifying his patrons enjoyment. Valet parking and a limited number of private lot spots are available.There also seems to be a solid rotation of cute hostesses to greet you upon entry. The lunch menu is minimalist but pleasing, every item I have ordered has been satisfactory. It is a great place to watch afternoon golf or other sports at the bar. The patio and bocce ball court are lively and fun for happy hour in nice weather. The clientele is an equal ratio of male and female 25-60 year old professionals for lunch, I have been told that it gets a bit sexier when the sun goes down.",

You get a bottle of wine and one of their delicious apps for only $22. That's a steal! You can order their cheesy Tatter tots or get their trifecta hummus. All the apps are made to share and delectable in every bite. Their patio is perfect for a large party to sit next to the fireplace (we had 8 of us). This place will be my go to place for Tuesday Hh with the girls!",

With the exception on Sundays, they have been consistently understaffed for the brunch crowd, where I'm sure they'd get most of their business. My fiance and I waited for nearly 30 minutes before anyone even walked to our table. We approached the Manager and her response was simply they were too busy. Unbelievably bad service. I actually felt bad for the waitress because there were only 2 servers for the entire patio! They made it right by comping our food but, really slooooow service and the food was bad.

I have also had their summer shrimp salad, steak salad, fish tacos and several other things. All delicious! I have figured out that no matter what I order, the chef behind the menu knows his food! They really understand how to create depth and develop flavors.  By the way, their dinner menu is much better than their brunch/lunch menu, so go AFTER 2!

There was a live jazz trio playing and we were also paid a visit from our kitty cat friend.  The menu changed since my last visit which was some time ago.  I recognized many Old Standby items, but some new ones too...   We started with drinks - I had a glass of Malbec, the boys each had beer, and our pregnant friend had a virgin mojito.  And while the five spice edamame appetizer was missing a spice or three, we still managed to eat most of it.  For main courses, I went for the Veggie Korma, J had the decomposed fish tacos, Jeremy had the Steak Salad and Johanna enjoyed the chicken sandwich.  Next time I'll hope to try the new Vig, but this one is super close, convenient, and fun.  I still highly recommend it after all of these years!",

Although I have missed out on the Sunday Fundayness of The Vig, I can easily understand how it gets hoppin'!  The outdoor patio is spectacular for lounging, glass clinking and chatting, and when you add music, you can see how the place would just light up.  My experiences have been less rock n roll and more just rock-esque, but wonderful nonetheless. This past time we were waiting for a friend to join us and we were starving (read: hung over), so I asked the gentleman filling up my lemonade (refreshing and just enough tart for my taste buds) if he could bring us some bread (which I don't believe is customary), but ask and you shall receive must be The Vig's motto, because that is exactly what happened. It wasn't a half-ass attempt either, it was a country loaf with a butter marmalade spread in the middle. Delightful!  Then came my Hot Chick (which I ordered for obvious reasons) - their version of a sensational toasted sandwich (grilled chicken breast, arugula, roasted tomato and smoked mozzarella served with spicy avocado spread on ciabatta). I only ate half because of the generous portion of vig rings accompanying the 'wich. They were so well prepared and struck the perfect balance of onion and ring!  Another exceptional dining sesh at The Vig. One of these days I will go for just their cocktails (this eating thing is getting out of control)!",

Ambience is very relaxed in the outdoor patio/lounge.  Get some friends, some great drinks (awesome selection), and relax on the comfy furniture outside.    Oh, sometimes there's also a cat (owner's?) that hangs about outside on the weekdays.. some people are bothered by it but I thought it was kind of funny that it just ignores everybody and does a full-body layout on one of the ottomans.",

We shared the traditional wings, chips and guacamole, and sliders from the happy hour menu all of which were delicious.  Wings were crispy and full of flavor worthy of 5 stars alone.  Salsa was a bit bland, but the chips were fresh and guacamole was tasty to compensate.  Lastly the sliders get the two thumbs up for being on pretzel rolls.

I usually try to sit inside as the trees outside have leaves that can fall on your table/food.  Leaves won't hurt you, but depending on the breeze it can make it not as enjoyable.

    "text": "I'm sure this may have been talked about in the many reviews here but I feel like this is important enough that I start out with this.  **The parking**.  This location has complimentary valet and the valet company uses the entire restaurant parking lot for this.  If you wish to have your car parked in the restaurant lot, you will need to use the valet.  Now there is no upfront charge for this service (complimentary after all) but as with all valet service, a tip is expected so plan accordingly.  If you wish to not use the valet at all, you will need to park at the shopping center across the street.  It is a short walk and is something I will do next time I visit here.  Last night was my first time here and it was for my friend's birthday dinner.  The group of us ordered the bruschetta and the artichoke, kale, jalepeno dip for apps.  Both were delicious but the bruschetta was my favorite.  The toppings for the bruschetta tasted fresh and the bread was nice and crisp.  The dip came out very hot and is served with both pita bread triangles and tortilla chips.  I liked the dip better with the tortilla chips... I felt like it tasted a lot better with that instead of the pita bread.  I was afraid the dip would be spicy with the jalepeno but it was surprisingly mild.  Maybe I got lucky and everyone else ate all the jalepenos for me!  After seeing all the pics for the short rib tacos on here, I was sold on ordering them.  For the most part, I did like it but the slaw not so much.  Maybe too much vinegar?  I can't really describe it.    This location (actually all of their locations) are really far and out of the way for me.  This is not somewhere I would choose to go to on my own.  If I were to be invited out to this place again, I would consider coming back.",

The weather was absolutely perfect and I immediately loved how open their indoor/outdoor dining room was. Decided to sit on their patio and learned they had live music! My son who is 2 1/2 really enjoyed being able to be outside, eat great food, and enjoy the music.   We ordered gauc, which was very fresh and had a nice spice to it, kids Mac and cheese, which was phenomenal, beet salad, which was also delicious, and a chicken sandwich. Every single item we had was impressive.   Service was great too- our waitress recommended everything and she was right. Great place to visit! Thanks Vig!",

Their house red wine was a great smooth merlot (and a generous pour) that was a lot better than I was expecting, and my guy appreciated their Four Peaks Kilt Lifter on draft. We weren't particularly hungry but wanted to at least try their food. Unfortunately nothing really jumped out at us on the menu, but apparently dinner is where they shine, according to other reviews. The roasted brussels sprouts are a little boring but it's always good to see a vegetable available instead of just deep-fried junk.  Cute outdoor patio area seems nice for chilling at night!",

The mid 30s bartender with shoulder length blonde hair is so appallingly rude to not only the other employees, but also to the people that come here to eat & drink.  The bad temperament and lack of respect she has for everyone is baffling.  For this reason, its not likely that I will come back to this location.    It doesn't matter if you sit at a table or the bar, ask her one thing and she will act so inconvenienced to the point where her responses are always blatantly condescending.  On numerous occasions I have asked her about menu/bar items or even assistance as she's walked by and have been left with nothing but a horrible interaction.  It's only until she remembers I am a business owner within the area that she changes her attitude towards me.   I have talked to management before about this but apparently nothing has changed.   Again, the convenience is due to proximity for meetings and living close by, but preference would be Filmore or Uptown locations.  Stars are for the other incredibly hardworking, helpful and fun employees.",

The most pleasant experience (although they were all fine) was at this one, which happens to be the location I used to frequent.   I met some friends here for brunch. I love that The Vig has not only ventured into the brunch game, but specifically the cheap mimosa brunch game ($3 each). Although I don't drink them, the $4 Bloody Mary deal is also great (especially since they're made specifically w/Titos).    I was surprised it wasn't THAT crowded around noon on a Saturday when we came. I met two friends, and the food & service were great. I ordered the breakfast sandwich on a croissant and it came with potatoes. It was delicious! All the brunch items are are priced beyond fairly, and are good sized portions. I should also note I got the EXACT same meal at the Vig Fillmore a week later (I'm a creature of habit), and although it was fine, it was better at this location (there it fell apart and the potatoes were a little overcooked).   I'm glad I rediscovered this place. I'm thrilled they do bruch & I'll be back!",

A few of my foodie favorites are their 40th Street Nachos (LOADED with so much goodness), Steamed Edamame (Soy Garlic -- I do miss the 5 spice!!), Holy Mac & Cheese (add Bacon or Broccoli) & It is seriously AMAZING! The best in the valley in my opinion. Which is saying a lot because I consider myself a Mac & Cheese connoisseur. ;) & the Hot Chick.   They have fabulous Happy Hour specials Monday - Friday from 3 PM - 6 PM. A few highlights from the HH menu include; $5 Sliders (3 per order), $5 daily flatbread, $3.50 Steamed Edamame, $4 Guac (heavenly) & Chips, $5 Hot Vings, $2 off cocktails & premium spirits, $2 off wine, $1.50 off draft and premium beer. Every Sunday they have 1/2 off bottles of wine. They also have daily specials that are fantastic. They currently have $4 Tito's Vodka drinks all day err day {Until the end of September}.  Entertainment:  Bocce Court Tuesday, Wednesday & Sunday: Live Music {Elvis Before Noon is amazing!} Thursday - Saturday: DJ You can check out their events calendar to see who is playing! You can also order late night eats until 1 AM (AND Yes, the Nachos AND Mac & Cheese are on the late night menu... thank goodness!!)",

This place is definitely an \"upscale neighborhood tavern,\" with indoor and outdoor seating and an extensive drinks menu. We ended up with a table on the patio; at first, we found it a tad chilly, but after our nice server moved a heatlamp closer to our table, we felt much better. I ordered the \"Vigan\" sandwich (loaded with siracha hummus, avocado, tomato, grilled zucchini and squash) and selected the sweet potato fries as my side. Everything was really good! Portion size is generous (I took half of my sandwich home). My table of 3 shared a brownie for dessert and it was a good thing we did because that brownie was rich and dense.

Picture this... you are wealthy, have a nice home, and you love to entertain... now picture the atmosphere you would want to ideally create... this is a replica of that...  You walk in the door and you're immediately taken by the ambiance you pictured in your head. The music is not overbearing but slightly loud enough to hear over the full conversations happening all around you. The bar is situated down the right side of the wall where behind it lies the kitchen that creates tasty dishes and small plates. To the left is a row of booths large enough to comfortably seat groups for a cozy fun time. As you make your way to the \"back\", you come upon a partially enclosed area that is made for hot weather (with shade and misters) as well as cold (with a fireplace situated in the middle of the secluded courtyard outside. Also in the middle of the patio rises up a large shading tree covered in small white lights to add to the cozy, romantic-esque scene.  As for the drinks, they are priced pretty fairly and the bartenders can make anything you can think up. Their wine list is moderate in price as well as products. If you feel the need to tantilize your tastebuds, their menu is not as healthy as I would like but it is damn tasty! The best thing on their entire menu is their signature bowl of Mac N Cheese. I always add bacon and broccoli. The bowl is large enough for two so I eat half there and take the rest home. What's even better about this place is that the kitchen stays open fairly late and they have decently varied HH prices and options.  All in all, this is a nice place that you wish you could call home. All they need now is a back room with a bed! LOL",

Make sure you have cash for valet + tip, or be in the know as to where you can park before walking over.   It's a pretty hip joint. I'd say the highlight of the place is the outdoor courtyard- it's bigger than the restaurant itself, and on the beautiful spring nights like these just absolutely gorgeous. Apparently they have a resident cat too, which I find adorable. Though one of my table mates was allergic, so the poor guy probably appreciated that a bit less.   My dish was okay. I didn't really get to sample any of everybody else's appetizers seeing as how we got there so late. I did enjoy the cheesy tots, and that jalapeno aioli is pretty amazing. I got the reuben sandwich and it was... okay I guess. Nothing to write home about. The shoestring fries were nice. My drink was stronger than I would have liked. I got reaaaally tipsy, but it wasn't a taste explosion or anything.  So really... this place was okay. Nice ambience, but nothing extraordinary.",

We constantly have to ask out server over and over again for items...that is if we can't find her. This has happened on multiple occasions. Not sure if they are just under staffed.",

    "text": "Great food, great specials, and even better ambiance.  Only thing holding this place back as my favorite \"go to place\" for drinks and meal is the service.  Meal:  I had a Monte Cristo for brunch the last time I was there.  I also had the cheesy tater-tots.  Taste:  My sandwich and the sides were awesome.  It wasn't fussy, simple, fun, and done extremely well.  I felt like the food was extremely fresh and \"thoughtful,\" in that the meal options for the time of day were perfect and had their own, unique twists without jumping the shark.  9 out of 10.  Value:  At first, I was taken back on what I thought were small portions but I came hungry and left full.  I think I was doing more thinking with my stomach than with my brain when I first got my meal.  The proportions are more than fair and reasonable but it won't blow you out of the water.  4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  I hate to say it, but they hostesses and waitresses seem like a bunch of airheads.  Very nice and sweet people but they come off as clueless at times and lack the professional polish that would be consistent and expectedt with experienced and professional restaurant employees.  You have to sometimes \"help connect the dots for them\" and they were too often having to \"ask the chef\" what is included in the food.  In all, the staff appears not to be attentive and not knowledgeable about the menu.  Again, very nice and sweet people but service has some opportunities to grow.  Parking is a major issue and can be difficult.  6 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  The Vig has the best outdoor scene by far.  Inside of The Vig is great but the patio is even better.  They also have a neighborhood cat name Meow-Meow that comes around and she is a supper sweet kitty.  Wish I could give more than 5 points . . . OH WAIT!  This is my fucking review and I will give them two bonus points for the excellent ambiance! 7 out of 5.  (The Vig is the first review I have ever given that received bonus points.  Probably the biggest honor they have ever received!  No?  Ok, you are probably right, it is not much of any honor, but still, it is exciting to me!)  Overall:  The fiance and I are having our rehearsal dinner here because we like it so much.  It is a great way to show the fun and trendy side of Phoenix to our mid-western guests. 26 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars.",

The good news- I believe they are all on the lunch special menu where you get the meal & a soft beverage for $10! It can get quite busy there, so I would recommend arriving closer to 11:00 or 11:30am, and unfortunately you will be forced to either valet or park across the street. The valet is a hysterical concept, since they literally are just parking it right in the (usually) empty lot in front of the restaurant. It's honestly more of a hassle than a benefit most of the time, but oh well.",

So I nicely said that's fine go get up. And she said to me \" Your going to get your sassy white ass up now!\" I was very taken back and very offended and probably is said a few words I shouldn't have. Later on I was cornered by a manager or so she said in the bathroom. Which I found odd, so I ask or I tried to ask the lady that had the problem why would she not come to me first and asking whatever she needed to ask me instead of sending an Entourage. Long story short this woman have had it out for me and my friend the whole time as soon as we got there and management did not help at all. It was a terrible experience they never gave us a chance to talk before they physically put my friend in a Full Nelson and manhandled her like a rag doll all for trying to ask somebody a question. Out of control. I really like this place I thought it was cool I would never ever go there again not after this",

This is about the time you learn what a vig is, and how much it means to a bookie. Fuck. I digress, sorry.  The Vig is full of good looking people, so the ambiance gets high praise. Food is well above average, try the Thai Chili Chicken Wings.  Coors Banquet served in old fashioned 12 ounce bottles had me fantasizing I was a cattle rustler in the old west.   Crowded on a Wednesday night, our crew sat on the patio. It was hot out and I got a bad case of swamp ass. Luckily, I carry a small ziplock of gold bond mentholated powder which resembles about $10,000 worth of coke.  The guy in the men's room who saw me putting it on my butt thought I was crazy. I told him coke on your sack is quite the experience if you can afford it.    After that, my ass felt like it was smoking Newports throughout dinner, enjoying my  Vig experience for the first time since Super Bowl 2002.  Anyway, I like this place and you probably will too.  Wait till the weather cools off if you're going to sit on the patio, or else have some mentholated butt powder handy.",

    "text": "This place is great! I used to live in the Phoenix area and had a layover the other night. A friend grabbed me from the airport and took me straight to The Vig for drinks.  The space is gorgeous. I loved the mix of indoor and outdoor seating, with the benefit of a fireplace, trees, and well-placed lighting. I also loved the bar kitty, what a cutie.   We came in late on a week night, and it wasn't overly busy. The servers were friendly and helpful, with good tips on food and drink. I enjoyed my Irish Exit, although I hoped for a little more umph from the plum bitters. The nachos were amazing. We made quick work of them and I considered pushing for another plate. Kinda wish I had, they were that good.  Don't know when I'll be Arizona way again, but I'd love to return to The Vig when I am.",

It's a good place to head to for happy hour, or a pre-game/in-between places. I don't understand the hype it has in most crowds though. Their food tends to be good but not great, and I am always slightly disappointed in most things I order. I always try new things and have been at least 10 times (so it's definitely not for lack of effort). The mac and cheese is a bit bland especially, which is so discouraging! Mac and cheese is delicious 9 out of 10 times, but not superb here.  I do enjoy some of their cocktail options, such as the Daily Mules! Yum! They also always tend to be out of a lot of their draft options, or don't carry much!   If you're in the area and need to kill time, I definitely say go for it! But it's not the top of my list.",

These guys have one of the better ones. The drinks are delicious! Moscow mules done well. Food and drinks were both excellent. The service was good. Overall, I would recommend.

Their Moscow mules were really great along with the wine list. My friend and I got the Kale Jalapeno and artichoke dip which was really really tasty although some parts of the dip were very cold and others were extremely hot. We decided to eat around the cold spots because it was honestly really tasty and we were so hungry. Along with that I got the hummus that came with pita, veggies, dried fruit and I got it with chicken. The hummus alone was really good. The dried fruit kinda weirded me out so I didn't have any. The chicken was under seasoned which was a bummer because it was an extra $4. The cooked zucchini came chilled which also kind of weirded me out. Other than the food and the darkness or the restaurant, the service was amazing. We had the friendliest server Ryan and I give him 5 stars! But as far as the food goes I'll probably just be back for drinks.",

I like that they also have a handful of Trivial Pursuit cards at each table to help keep the table entertained while waiting for food or while kicking back a few drinks.. They also have misters so its never too hot outside.. however, if no one has been sitting at the table for a little, the table and chairs may be wet so watch where you sit!  I have been here twice so far and plan to continue to come back here often. The first time I was here I had the gauc and chip. The gauc is refreshing and light with a good flavor- definitely a good place to start with food here. I also had the vanilla braised short rib tacos. I felt like the meat was really sweet by itself. When eating it altogether in its taco form it was still a little on the sweet side but really good.    This last time I was here I ordered the nachos with carnitas and I was very happy with the dish that came out. The topping to chip ratio was amazing. I would even go far enough to say that there were more toppings than there were chips, which the little fat kid inside me LOVES. My bf got the triple sliders on the pretzel bun with a side of the fries. The fries are so good. They are very thinly cut but still manage to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The burgers were good but nothing really to talk about other than they have a pretzel bun. My friend who was with us got the thai chili wings and that was delicious. The wings were not too spicy nor to sweet. It was a very good mix of both.",

However the bar tender was rude the entire time. We order wings and the salad once the food came I asked for more salad dressing and she made it seem as if it was an issue. Once we got the bill the wings weren't on happy hour as she had mentioned. I asked about it and she said they aren't and that she was wrong but didn't correct the bill.   My next visit I came in to order the exact same thing and come to find out that they didn't have the items to make the Cobb salad. Unfortunately, I came to the party late with friends otherwise I would have left after them not having the item. I could understand if it was a late night order but mid day on Sunday to \"run out\" of items not sure that's ok.   Overall, the food is good when they have food in stock and the service is very hit or miss. I'm not a fan and don't think that I'll be visiting this place anymore and probably won't be recommending it to any friends.",

Great music and each and every one of us loved our food and had no complaints.  Definitely a lifesaver and a cool place to hang out and eat good lounge food.",

My fiance had the fried chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries (which I stole because no one could pass them up). I had the Asian chopped salad, we both cleaned our plates. The only downside was the location didn't have enough parking and we took a gamble on where to park. Thankfully the host was right and our car was still there after we finished. We just need to find the right location and we'll be regulars.",

Just like Georgeanne says below, I live extremely close. Roughly 30 seconds closer then her and my walking stride might be longer so I'd say about 7 minutes walking and 6 power walking. I am a MASSIVE fan of getting drunk and not having to drive home. Whether its cabbing it, hitch hiking, or walking, I will not get a DUI. The food here is slightly above great and below \"drop your pant and put yourself in it' amazing. The beer selection is good, not great, but they rotate drafts quite often which is nice. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. I think I've hit on the hot manager nearly everytime I've been in and still cant remember her name. The patio is the shit! Its larger then the inside part and it has botchiball. Drinking+botchiball=funny Kodak moments!",

If you can't get a seat outside on the patio it can be hard to talk to the person across from the table from you.  Minor complaint in an otherwise awesome bar though.

The space is open and comfortable, the atmosphere is upscale but casual, and the... oh, geez, I can't even think about the luxurious wood grains and summer-vacation-in-the-Hamptons furniture appointments, as I am overcome with an almost Pavlovian fixation with the fact that this place has Bocce ball as its main attraction. Pair almost any dated, archaic, or kitschy activity with alcohol and I'm pretty much useless to resistance, but Bocce pushes me almost to utter nirvana. There's no sign up sheet, and from the few times I've been here, perfect strangers are relatively eager to make Bocce alliances. If it's late enough, you may even be joined by the chef and owner, Doug, who encourages mischief on the court, including but not limited to: human obstacles, flagrant taunting, or ridiculous ball-launching methods. And the Vig's outstanding gin selection is a big sell. It almost feels like what the Merc Bar would be if it had a patio and didn't have over 10 years of spilled drinks and smoke damage. It's new, it's hot, and I hear the burgers aren't too shabby. I'm looking forward to checking out the dining menu, but until that happens, I'm left to encourage you to share in the unpretentious fun The Vig offers.",

I'm giving it 3 stars, because I keep going back for the strawberry bbq wings, but as far as service goes this place is hysterical. The staff arn't rude they're just missing. We came in about 40 min before closing time one night and were completely ignored by every waiter who walked by, We ended up repeatedly walking to the bar for drinks and to inquire about our food, bc no one would wait on us. My favorite experience was when a fellow co-worker and I went to buy a bottle of wine at 11:45 on a Sunday night. We thought they closed at 2am (which is posted on the door). The waitress allowed us to buy the bottle of wine, corked it, poured us glasses, and then told us they were closing at 12 because they were slow!? Who does that?! She then brought me the check and told me I could take it with me?! Another time I opted to buy the Vig Rig guy a drink on my tab as my tip and discovered he had put 15$ drink on my tab. Yeah, that one's my fault, but I still think it was super tacky and unprofessional. So yeah, good wings, good late night menu, but the kind of service that is actually funny-bad.",

We had business clients in town this week and wanted to seat a party of seven for lunch.  Since they don't take reservations, I called about 15 minutes ahead to give them a heads-up we were on our way.  I did not realize that a coworker also called 15 minutes prior for the same reason.  When we arrived, the hostess seemed really put-out that we had called her TWICE and generally had such a rude demeanor that even our out-of-town clients commented on it.  Then she proceeded to seat us at a table that was too small to accomodate 7 people.  We actually had to squeeze 2 people at the head of the table, which was very uncomfortable.  Seeing as how the restaurant was half empty, I think she could have been more accomodating.  The host/hostess is the \"first impression\" for any restaurant, and this woman was definitely a sour note.  Perhaps the Vig should make her a dishwasher instead?",

We were seated 60 minutes later even though throughout our wait time we saw multiple tables empty and wait staff rolling silverware or on their cell phones by the indoor bar. We looked at the menu while we waited and so as soon as we were seated we ordered....fish tacos and a chicken sandwich. 45 minutes later we still had not received our food. When we asked the waitress what was taking so long and explained that we had 8pm start time for a show we were attending.  She apologized for the long wait time and told us that some of her other tables were also waiting for their food and also had a 8pm deadline.  She left us saying she would check with the kitchen. She came back and informed us that our \"ticket\" was still 2 to 3 tickets from being next in line and that the kitchen was backed up because there had been large parties there that evening.  This is a classic example of their problem became our problem.   Two hours after having arrived at The Vig for a nice dinner out...we left without having eaten. MY ADVISE DON'T EAT AT THE VIG before any type of show downtown. There are many places downtown that better manage their kitchen, waitstaff and seating system and where you  can actually get the service and product they are supposed to be in business to provide.",

I loved sitting under the trees and night sky over the weekend, sipping Mai Tai's. The DJ music on hard drive was really good for me. The Adirondack chairs are super comfortable and the coffee tables excellent to put your feet up or even sit on to face your date.  The giving back to the community programs behind the Vig are always a good bet. Currently they are doing a back to school contribution for a few eligible schools. 15% of your bill during September, The Vig will donate to Hopi Elementary, Tavan Elementery, Ingleside Middle, St Terisa, St Thomas and Christ Lutheran.   Plus the bonus round. The school that earns the largest rebate gets $500 in gift cards, another cool auction item for the fundraisers. Good luck you guys! Ends Sept 30, there's still time. Don't forget to tell your server which school you like, it's open to everyone.",

    "text": "We came for dinner, first time visit.  Small parking lot w/ mandatory valet parking at dinner time.  Arrived just as Happy Hour was nearing the end, few empty tables.  We were seated next an exit door to the patio where a cold blast of air hit us with every opening of the door.  I had to keep my coat on throughout the meal.  This table also had very poor lighting, so bad that I could not read my menu.  Worse yet was the smoke.  Yes, smoke smoke smoke in 2013.  While the dining area is non-smoking, the patio is smoke-friendly.  Several were seated on the patio in front of the fireplace and filling up the dining area with smoke.  Another exit to the patio was actually a drape left open so there was no real separation between smoking and non-smoking.  I felt like I was in a bar back in the old smoking days.  Ugh!  Our food was very good.  While I could not actually see what I was eating (refer to paragraph above), I enjoyed a chopped salad with some interesting veggies.  Hamburger was also nicely done with a side of onion rings.  Service was also very attentive and friendly.  Other reviewers have mentioned the lovely patio.  Shame that it's ruined by the smokers.  This place has a nice look to it and has a lot going right but I vote with my feet for clean air.    Sorry Vig, you let me down and I won't be back.",

    "text": "The best part about the Vig is the patio.  In nice weather, sitting outside with the lights, heaters as necessary and a fire-pit, makes for a great ambiance that can only be found so frequently in Phoenix.   They offer a nice wine menu and fresh cocktails, making the Vig a great spot for drinks only as well as a good dinner.  Last time I was there I tried the Pad Thai, which was surprisingly good for not being an Asian restaurant.  The french fries that came with my boyfriend's sliders were half regular, and half sweet potato, and they were amazing. Our table of 4 split two bottles of wine and the garlic edamame (yumm) appetizer and everybody was quite satisfied.    The atmosphere is very social, and someone from our party ran in to someone she knew and was able to catch up pretty easily. Service is good, with knowledgeable servers who are attentive enough to be helpful without overbearing.  One thing to note is that parking in their lot is usually mandatory valet, but if they're slow enough that's not always enforced.  There's no great alternative for parking in the neighborhood, so I recommend factoring that cost in to your visit.    All in all, The Vig is fun for a night out or date night! It's definitely worth checking out.",

Then another lady who took our order and then a lady who brought our food and drinks and checked on us. It was quite confusing.   I ordered the Mac and cheese which was a LARGE portion. It was supposed to come with a drink but the waitress never asked for what we wanted and we had to ask the other lady for soda after checking the menu to make sure.. then she walked away quickly and came back a few minutes later to ask what soda we wanted. My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich which he liked with the sweet potato fries which were TASTEY!!!",

You don't see many places that do that and it is a nice touch.  The sliders are of decent size and served on a pretzel bun with a nice aioli. One of the best burgers that I have had, very good flavor and all the small things like good veggies, cheese, and seasoned just right to make it one memorable burger.  Oh yes the fries are high quality, the must fry them in a different oil than the run of the mill place, thin fries that were way better than the average fry.  Still had room for the mac and cheese which followed the trend of being an amazing dish. Rich, cheesy, and full of flavor.  This was just from the late night menu, I would love to come back and try some of their featured entrees. I am very impressed with the Vig and I am glad I stopped here late night to eat.",

The spices in the cranberry relish/chutney/sauce/whatever-you-want-to-call-it-it's-good make the sandwich. Oh, and the pretzel bread it comes on. Oh, and the turkey. It's all I can do to order something else from the menu every time I'm here. Oh, and ask for extra cranberry on the side. Just trust me.  Okay, now that's out of the way, I've always liked the place, the mood, the open area for when the weather is good, and the easy vibe. The menu is pretty good even if you're not getting the turkey - I just can't really tell you what you should get. But the wife likes what she orders every time - I just never notice it from the dregs of my cranberry bath.  Service has always been good, though this place will get busy on typical nights, so the only miracle they work is the cranberry. ;)  Did I go to heavy on the cranberry?",

We've had great service, food and we love the ambiance.  We parked across the street both times in the strip mall.  On Monday, we went between 6pm and 9pm for the cheeseburger fries special.  This hamburger is on a pretzel bun and u can either get regular fries or the sweet potato fries, both great.  On Tues, we went during happy hour between 3pm and 6pm.  There are about 7 food items on it and we ordered the buffalo wings and the fish tacos and both were excellent.  We also tried the pork posole and that was excellent.  We would also like to thank our server Jessica and manager Thelma for making our Tues visit great.  Although I think their regular prices are kind of high, their happy hour and aftr 6pm specials are 2nd to none.  I believe Mon thru Friday, besides their happy hour, they have a different food special when happy hour ends starting at 6 to 9 p.m.  This is our go to place now.... we love The Vig on 40th.",

    "text": "This review is for the McDowell Ranch location.  First of all, the restaurant itself is beautiful and I really love the outside patio area.  Last night was my third time there and on all three occasions my party and I sat outside.  And on each of these occasions we had the same experience of loud kids running around unsupervised.  They were climbing on the walls which post clear signs saying Please Do Not Climb.  All this while the parents were sitting around their respective tables drinking and being totally oblivious to the havoc their children were wreaking on other patrons.  And none of the employees seemed to want to deal with it either.  It was not an enjoyable, relaxing experience we had hoped for.  Ok, now the food.  My first visit there I ordered a grilled romaine salad with creamy feta dressing and it was wonderful.  By the second visit, maybe three weeks later, it disappeared off the menu, so I ordered the Asain Chop Salad.  It was just ok.  Last night I ordered the Cobb Salad (I am a salad person) WITHOUT the blue cheese....I hate blue cheese...but it came with blue cheese, which unfortunately, I did not notice immediately since it was evening and it also had chopped egg on top which hid the cheese.  I did not send it back because it had already taken forever to get our dinners and I was in a hurry to get out and away from \"McDonald's Playland\".  So I picked off as much of the cheese as I could but I could still taste it.  I also ordered grilled salmon on the salad and that came out tough and dry....severely overcooked.  My husband said his burger was just ok, and he was just as disgusted as I was that we had to witness Romper Room whilst eating.  Parents, please either leave your kids at home or make sure they behave appropriately if you do bring them, not only to be curteous to other diners, but for the safety of your own children.  I witnessed many near-accidents from falls to running into waiters with trays of hot food.  Not to mention this place could be considered easy pickings for a child predator since parents are not paying attention and there is ideal access to parking lots and streets on all sides.  I will not be back for a fourth visit.",

We came here based on the good reviews and the lack of places in Phoenix that serve a decent cocktail and have wifi (telecommuting FTW). Our first clue should have been the valet parking... really?? You only offer valet parking? What is this, Arcadia!?   Music is loud and from the Music for Melenials Spotify channel. Guys wear backwards baseball caps. Women talk loudly and all look straight out of magazines.  Menu is diverse and has gluten free options. The food we ordered (including happy hour fish tacos) was very good - actually worth the pricy cost. Too bad the other personality traits of this place are too much for us to ever come back again.   If you want to stay in your 20s this is the place for you. Screams douche bag.",

We sat outside on their gorgeous outdoor patio, right next to the fire.  The food was amazing (I had a sandwich, even though it was breakfast time - the sliced prime rib with aus jus - YUM), and the service was great.  On Monday, I spontaneously decided to hit it up for happy hour, and had an equally excellent experience.  \"My\" table by the fire was open, so we sat there again! Happy hour was awesome (wings were delicious, as were the sliders) Bonus - on Monday nights, you can get a full burger with fries (regular or sweet potato) for only $5!  They have bocce ball outside, and even the interior feels open and airy.  I definitely want to go back soon!",

It's a restaurant bar, but the layout makes it very easy to approach new people and make new friends. They have bocce ball in the back patio, which is always a good time (especially after a few drinks). They don't usually have drink specials, but sometimes they do $5 pretzle bun burger Mondays, and that is the best thing ever! It has a really cool atmosphere with plenty of booths, trivial pursuit cards on the tables, and an expansive rear outside dining area with cozy fireplace seating.",

I had some drink with \"skinny\" in the name...tequila, fresh orange and lime juice, etc.  Super good....and strong.  The bf said they had a great beer selection.  He had Anchor Steam which not many bars seem to have, so he was very happy!  I had the The Vigan....grilled vegetable sandwich.  Very good, but next time I'll order it without the cheese as it was unnecessary and I ended up taking most off anyway.  Fries were great....very skinny and crispy.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  We'll definitely go again!",

This past Tuesday I attended the Craft Beer dinner with friends. The dinner is three courses paired with a craft beer. The chef comes out and discusses the course with each table and the hostess educates us about each beer. It only takes place at the end of the month and you have to make a reservation by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:pvincent@thevig.us\">pvincent@thevig.us</a>. Its a great experience. Well this past time the menu featured a club sandwich and pork ribs. I am not a pork eater and when the chef came around I asked if the bacon could be removed from my sandwich because of it. He said sure no problem and I have a special surprise for you. I was just happy with the no bacon in my sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised when I received chicken drums in instead of ribs. It was above and beyond what I expected. I really appreciated it. If  you get a chance stop by, the food is always good and go to a Craft Beer dinner! Great place.",

It is a BIG mistake to ever go to the Vig, the more people I deter from going there the better!

The server (Tessa) was fabulous, friendly and efficient.  I enjoyed the wine I ordered and everything about the place, as well as Meow Meow, the resident cat who makes herself more than comfortable on the cushioned couch.  I had the \"Love Me Tenderloin\" Sandwich.  OMG!  It was absolutely DELICIOUS!  I have not raved about a meal at a restaurant in a loooong time.  It was juicy, tasty, messy, yummy.  I chose side salad with it.  I also had the edamame and took that home because I had to finish the sandwich.  It was that good.  I came here from Minnesota to escape the winter.  A couple girlfriends are joining me here and I have been scoping places to take them.  I will take them here.  They will love it.    Yeah, it is a bit pricy, but I got much better value here than I did at Terroir Wine Pub.  Far friendlier service, more food and better food!  If you are in Phoenix and dont' know where to go, go here.  It has a great patio, fabulous service, friendly staff, great food and wine.    You could go here and then to Postino before or after.  They are within a couple miles of each other.   I loved the overhead music.  Not too obtrusive, just right.  Overall a FABULOUS experience!",

I have frequented this bar/restaurant in the past merely for their atmosphere, pretty scenery and great patio; however, more than a few times the service has been downright unprofessional and staff rude from time to time.   I was recently in the restaurant with a fairly large party and we all ended up with food poisoning from the hummus and baba ganoush. I wasn't so upset that it happened because it's a risk one takes but what happened after I will never forget. After nicely calling the manager Pam, I only wanted to inform her of what had happened so that others would not get sick and she quickly became defensive and told me that it was impossible we could get sick on hummus. Sadly but True in my opinion she must have never taken a food safety class. As most of us know bacteria can grow in protein and hummus is all protein. She argued me and I quickly responded with the fact that eight people getting sick is no coincidence. As a manager in the past, it's right to sympathize with the customer, not defend. I wanted nothing from her but she quickly told me she would tell the chef and \"sorry, hope you feel better\", and she hung up the phone. This tells me the Vig's management is not only unprofessional but downright awful.   I never thought their food was that great anyway and it's a step up from bar food but if you want drink menus tossed at your table, long waits before being greeted, rude staff and food poisoning, then check out the Vig. If you don't want to park in valet, be careful parking in the check cashing parking lot because it can be dangerous crossing that busy street.",

    "text": "I had heard so much about The Vig from a pretentious gal I know who acts like her poop doesn't stink that I figured The Vig was some high faluti'n place....not.  I was surprised to find it pretty plastic and unattractive overall. But, the help there was very friendly and helpful when I arrived early for a function being held there.  Even the car parkers were nice.  Great help there, anyway, so I tipped more than the usual 20%. Now when it comes to the food I ordered the Pad Thai.  Big, big mistake.  It's bad, so don't order it.  It's pretty obvious that nobody in the kitchen has ever been to Thailand or worked in a Thai restaurant even, because it was not much like real Pad Thai.  It wasn't good even tho I ate it out of hunger. Rather than give this place a really low rating, I'll return some time and see how another item tastes.  Just avoid the Pad Thai, because my friends ordered other things and loved what they got. And the help there are super nice which counts for something.",

Everything from the valet parking ($3), to the inside decor and bar, and the incredible outdoor patio (where we ate) was perfect. The outdoor patio has an awesome fireplace and a boccie court! Great seating arrangements for dining or drinking.  The menu is very low key and affordable, mostly consisting of salads and sandwiches. We started with the hummus plate for an appetizer - it was served with two kinds of hummus and chopped cucumber and tomato. My Pastrami on Pumpernickel with coleslaw was yummy, and her chopped chicken salad / wrap combo hit the spot.  The cocktails looked great and the crowd is amazing.",

Anyway, ordered a delightful glass of Resiling and the Deconstructed Fish Tacos. Very yummy. The cole slaw was nice and crunchy. My only complaint was that the tortilla shells they gave to make the taco were insanely tiny. I could barely get any ingredients inside. Loved all the extras like the black beans, sour cream, gaucmole they provided but I wanted to eat it all, silly wraps wouldn't let me. So instead I just nibbled on everything and it turned into a deconstructed fish salad. Oh well. It was delish still.  I am so in love with the interior of this place. Literally looks like an old retro 70s motel with the atrium style seating outside and the bocce ball court. Loved it. I will def go back to this place. I hear the happy hour is to die for.",

    "text": "The Vig is a great spot for lunch, dinner, or late-night for some damn decent food, served up relatively quickly, and with a good variety of dishes to boot.  We showed up around 9:30 pm on a Friday night and there was no wait, seat yourself. We chose to sit outside because the music was just BUMPING inside and we wanted to at least be able to hear ourselves over dinner. We found a nice booth with plenty of room for the four of us, and a waiter (Scott, who was very nice) stopped by within a minute or two, max, to tell us waters were all ready on the way and could he get anything else for us.  I had the Love Me Tenderloin, which was this lovely beef dish served with these fantastic marinated onions & mushrooms, and this wonderful cheese-y potato dish of happiness. Overall, a good experience, and decently priced.  My compatriots had the salmon dish, which was cooked spot on and served with an awesome corn-mash chorizo side, and the potato pancake, which was equally good.  We cleaned our plates, played with some of the Trivial Pursuit cards on our table, and enjoyed a few beers.   Overall, a pleasant experience. Our server was there when we needed him and kept our drinks topped off, and everything came out fine (minus a misheard-for beer early on that was quickly resolved).  I was a bit disappointed that the patio didn't have any misters at all, as it was damn hot if you weren't out under the terrace where they have some cool ceiling fans, and the music was really quite loud even outside, though, to be fair, I think the booth we chose was right under a speaker. It was a live DJ, so I understand the virtue of keeping things up there, but it's a bit rough to have to shout to people across the table.  All in all, we'll probably be back, and I like that their late night menu is served through 1 am.  (Oh, bonus: they have lawn games on this stretch of lawn outside at the patio, including bocce ball!)",

I ordered the steak medium and it was well done and had a huge end section that was all fat.  I had already been there for some time and the service was pretty bad. Our waitress kept disappearing.  At one point we had to get another server to help us.  I did not have time to have it redone.  I asked that it be removed from my bill.  The GM Cheri came to the table and told me that \"that's what medium is to my chef\".  The entire steak was cooked through solid brown all the way.    What kind of manager comes over and tells you, you are wrong about an obviously overcooked steak?  It's pretty universal.  There were three in my party and it took about 40 minutes for food to even come out.  We were there over an hour just trying to have lunch  I know, I know....they were cooking the hell out of that steak!!!  I also know, I should have never ordered steak at the Vig! The time before that they served me raw hamburger that I actually wanted cooked well.  They took it in the back and nuked it, and brought me back the same plate with crusty ketchup on it.  Go figure from raw to \"OMG who would do this to a steak?\"  I will never go to this restaurant again.  The GM is something else.  I wish I knew who the owner was.  As a business owner I couldn't believe what a threat to revenue this crew and bad food is.  I would clear the deck at that place and start with some new staff (to be fair, there were servers who seemed to be great, just not ours)  ones who know a MEDIUM steak.   Here's hoping someday this turns back in to the cool little place it used to be.  Oh and just a side note, you should inform someone about the fruitty Iced Tea if they order an Arnold Palmer it makes a difference...just sayin' :)",

Despite this place always being packed, I've never had to wait that long to play. AND if I wear my red suede heels, my shoes match the red team perfectly! Aaah the small pleasantries of being female!  2. The food. I can't recall trying anything that I haven't liked. My favorite being the Hot Chick. I am a chicken sandwich fanatic and this is the best one that I have found. Ever. Slightly spicy with a generous helping of avocado. Dreamy. Oh and the curry aoli they serve with their sweet potato fries is to DIE for. Can I eat it on everything? Because I'd like to eat it on everything.   3. The drinks. I can't really say they're AMAZING, because I always have beer. I can get some of my fav standard beers, plus a few interesting cocktails if I feel like branching out. Good in my book!   4. The atmosphere/decor. Cute and attracts the beautiful crowd without feeling pretentious. The patio is lovely and they are always playing awesome music.  5. The staff. Friendly. Quick. Flawless. A+  6. I can walk there from my house. Seals the deal.   In fact I love it so much that I'm going in about...oooh 30 minutes, for happy hour :]",

My general first impressions:  - Awesome outdoor patio and live music - Good Sunday HH (1/2 price bottles of wine) - Food was ok - Kind of a \"cool hipster\" crowd  So first off we had a couple of bottles of decent wine.  I loved the patio and the band playing.  I had the shrimp salad, which was ok, but it was actually drenched in dressing (forgot to ask for it on the side).  I probably wouldn't order a salad again because I saw a couple of burgers go by and those looked pretty yummy - or I'll forgo the food for liquid nourishment.  ;) My friends all seemed to enjoy their meals, I think.  Fun, cool vibe about the place.  The server was generally attentive.    The only negative that I found was that our server added an extra meal into our tab...when we brought it to her attention, rather than correcting the bill and bringing us the correct one (we had already given her cash and our two cards) and bringing everything back to us she just said that she would take the meal off.  It kind of screwed up our mojo when figuring out the bill...it all ended up being ok, but I think in the end, she screwed herself out of some of her tip.   Definitely will look forward to going back there sometime!",

    "text": "Douching is a mystery to me. I mean, what is it? How does it work? Would I like to help a woman do it? Would I want to associate with a woman who does it? Do all women do it? Is there a root cause? Is there a special syrup?  So I looked it up:  A douche is a device used to introduce a stream of water into the body for medical or hygienic reasons, or the stream of water itself. Douche usually refers to vaginal irrigation, the rinsing of the vagina, but it can also refer to the rinsing of any body cavity. A douche bag is a piece of equipment for douching - a bag for holding the fluid used in douching.  Now, to me, this sounds like a remarkable invention. But it's recently entered the moderm American lexicon as an insult typically directed at people like me.   Yep, I said it. I know many of you think I'm douchy. What you don't know is that I always wear a condom, so introducing a stream of fluid into the vagina for medical or hygienic reasons is just not something to which I aspire.  So who are these real-life douchers? I'll tell you. It's so easy.  It's the people who stand between the bar and the line of booths at the Vig. They're in the walkway, completely oblivious to everyone trying to make it from the bathroom to the patio and back. You, my friend, are a douche bag.   That said, everything else about the Vig is rad. It continues to be my favorite bar. The staff knows my drink. Love the patio. Best people watching in town. Sundays are so fun with the Daylons or whatever they're called. The music is always good, live or otherwise. The food has improved dramatically since my first review. Pam, the GM, is awesome.

    "text": "I've got to upgrade this place to a five star joint for three reasons.  1.  Their half and half plate of hummus and babba gannoush is the best I've ever had.  And at $4 during happy hour, it's a great way to start the night.  2.  Their gin and tonics are out of this world.  I don't know what they do differently, but it's a little sweeter and you can't taste the gin at all.  Warning: having 5+ of these guarantees that you will be hammered.  3.  The Vig Rig which was sweet enough to cater to two drunk girls and drop them off at their separate homes.  If only we knew that you picked up people to, then we wouldn't have had to deal with being stranded for the first part of our Saturday morning.  Even with your crowd of douches and cougars, I can't help but love you for my experience Friday night!",

While we were waiting I had a martini and it was just ok.  They don't have blue cheese olives and there were ice chips in the glass so it was like drinking a vodka slushi.  I should have just stuck with beer.  We had the hummus platter thing to start and it was pretty good though a bit salty.  This pitas were 'eh.  I ordered a side salad and it was just eh' as well.  Also, once again because I forgot to say something, our sweet potato fries came out before our meals.  WTF?!?  They are pretty good and not too greasy but their dipping sauce is still weird.  For an entree I ordered the VigAssBurger and it was very good.  I would order it again.  The burger was freshly made and cooked perfectly with tons of juicy flavor.  Somehow they have the food out super fast here which is awesome.  Our waitress was also very speedy and friendly which is very odd for a very busy night.  So yay Vig for those pluses.   I just wish I lived closer because this is a super cool place to come and drink, especially outside.  I could lounge there for hours.  I just don't want to come back for dinner because this really is more of a drinking/light-eating establishment.",

The outside is great, I mean bocce ball wasted at 1:37 on saturday is awesomely dangerous, and they have this vig rigg which will take you home for free (so so def) anyway go for some drinks and throw heavy balls at smaller white ones you'll have a good time.

    "text": "Alright folks. Let's not get carried away. When it comes to the whole \"I can't stand people with fake boobs and $300 sunglasses surrounded by hip decor\" thing, I stand with you. We are kindred spirit. That's not really my scene either and I can only tolerate it in small doses. But I don't believe in punishing an establishment that has worked hard to create a cool space for people to get together and have fun, just because of the social demographics of its crowd. Is the crowd really that important anyway, if you're there with your own group?   The Vig is exactly what even its complainers concede in their reviews: a very cool, trendy, \"modern tavern\" with an urban theme to its decor. Outside it has a giant fireplace and plenty of heatlamps to go around (wintertalk here, obviously), as well as comfortable outdoor couches and comfie chairs for groups of people to sit, drink, and blab. The staff is very friendly. At one point we moved to the interior, because the two friends I was with (one from Canada, the other from Chicago; they should be ashamed) were \"too cold\" as it was getting windy out, and we enjoyed the inside too.   The 3 of us were pretty entertained trying to figure out the crowd. Who are these people? They're not exactly the Scottsdale species (maricopus cosmeticimprovementus), though they appeared closely related. Definitely not Central Phoenix types (randomus emohippopotamus). Too old to be from ASU. The median age was probably 35 on the Friday night I was there. 30something douchebags galore. Investment bankers from the Biltmore area maybe? That was one of my friends' hypothesis. I thought it was a good one. But I also theorize that there is some element of the crowd that is influenced by the Vig's proximity to Paradise Valley, which is only 4 minutes away (for those who don't know, PV is Phx's residential answer to Beverly Hills; many celebrities who move here live in PV). Hollywoodus donchawannabelikeus?  So yeah, you might not fit in with this crowd but why should that stop you? By 7 or 8 o'clock, the Vig was completely hopping with good music and tons of people packed inside having fun, including us. We didn't try the food because the reviews seem to have torn that aspect to shreds. But the happy hour beers were 3 bucks each and appetizers were half off. What's wrong with that?  EDIT: One warning. The parking. Three bucks to valet, and I still have no idea where you would park for free to avoid that on a crowded night. Maybe across the street in the Basha's parking lot?",

    "text": "This has become the Sunday afternoon go-to hangout spot in Arcadia. I could be saying too much, because the Scottsdale douchebag crowd may catch on and disrupt our awesome neighborhood hangout. I LOVE spending my Sunday afternoons drinking a few beers here. The patio on Sundays is the place to be. Get there before 2:30 if you have any hopes of getting a table. After 3, the band, and thus the party gets underway, and it becomes a good time.  I've been coming here since before it was \"cool\" to be here. I've watched it slowly morph into a slightly confused too much to too many sort of place. It seems as though they don't know who, or what they are. The food, because of this crazy loss of direction has become \"eh\" quality. The menu is confusing, just in the read, then when you get this plate of confusion fusion, well, it just leaves too much on the plate. Again, I go back to the point that it is trying to be too much to too many. There are too many things going on in the dishes. Not in a bold, rich, dynamic, wow! sort of way, but in a \"HELP ME! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TASTING BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON!\" sort of way.   I suggest: Because I love the feel and vibe of this place.  Settle down! Simplify the menu. Focus on making simple, flavorful and quality food.  This is a neighborhood bar, not a 5-star bistro. The Turkey sandwich is a perfect example of screwing up a fantastically simple, good eating, sandwich. The crab artichoke dip is hated by those who serve it, and incredibly bland to those who order and eat it. Take the simplicity of that dish, and figure out how to enhance the flavors in it.   As far the service goes: I've had great service, and I've had abysmal service. Guess it's a hit and miss sort of thing. I will say that Scott is the best it gets there, and I make it a point to get into his section. Management has been rude to me on several occasions with a nose high attitude. I was asked to relinquish my table because my party hadn't shown up. Nothing that a polite, \"No. I will not.\" wouldn't fix, however.   Bottom line here: If you're looking for a fun place to grab a beer or glass of wine, and maybe a burger, with a great vibe, and fun people, this is the place. If you're looking for really great food, and friendly, hospitable service, you might want to go there first, then come to The Vig after filling your belly. 3 Stars. Barely. Because of the band and great vibe on Sundays.",

The place was packed inside and out.  Not a seat to be had outside.  There was a cool band playing cover songs.

    "text": "I hate being the first person to review a restaurant when I have a below par experience, but here it goes...  the Vig is a very cool space.  If you are design-minded, you will be very exited to see how this non-descript brick shoebox has been transformed into a hip happening bar and restaurant.  The bar is dimly lit, lively and boasts a huge plasma for watching games.  It is the \"anti-Postini\" if you know what I mean, and it is just the neighborhood hang-out I have been searching for (not that I have anything against Postino, I go there all the time, the vibe here is just distinctly different). So, my review for the BAR ONLY is 4 stars.  OK, now onto the hard part.  The food is bad.  The only redeeming quality is that it is also pretty cheap, so you can almost forgive the mis-step.  The Frenchie (french dip sandwich) could have been from Arbys.  The smoked salmon appetizer tasted like a concoction I could make at home - a slice of lox on a sliver of Safeway-quality french bread topped with a squirt of Thousand Island (not that I would ever subject myself to that at home). Very disappointing.  The grilled veggie plate was pretty good, but it was served with a bad vinaigrette that tasted suspiciously like bottled Italian salad dressing.  Food rating? 2 stars.    In sum, this place is a mixed bag.  It is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood and I will certainly be back for drinks, but I would go elsewhere for dinner.",

The fans were still going but they didn't help much. I tried some appetizers. The artichoke dip tasted like cream cheese. I though the guac and salsa were better. And the service was so slow. We were here for 2 hours and only had 2 drinks and not by choice.   I actually came here during Yelp Eats week and was never informed that they were participating. We were only given regular menus. After I found out that they were a participating restaurant a couple of days after our visit I asked some of the other people who had been there if they were ever offered the alternative menu and not one person said they had.

I have been to a few of there location and I can't tell which ones I like the most The deserts are so bomb and my girlfriend likes to say she doesn't want any and eat more then me.

The outdoor patio feels like someone's really nice backyard, it's always a fun time out there.  I've had nearly everything on the menu. My favorite items are the nachos with carnitas and the pozole. The pozole is out of this world, it's one of the best I've had in a long time. The Vig is my go to spot when I want a good meal, with a good vibe and I don't want to spend an arm an a leg.  One thing that is a bummer is that some of their locations use Nowait and others do not (at least they have in the past). The Nowait feature was an amazing option to get on the list without having to wait up front where there is limited seating.",

Drinks can be expensive, but they have a great happy hour (Monday-Friday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.). I haven't had a signature cocktail I didn't like and the well drinks are only $4.  Love this place!",

We also got the hummus and it was amazing. It came with hummus(duh), pita, bread, figs, roasted squash(?), and dried cranberries.

    "text": "I had been to The Vig (this same location) a long time ago and remembered not being impressed, but wanted to give them another shot.  Met a friend there for dinner and drinks since we were nearby.  The service was decent.  There was some chick there singing out on the patio and, yes I know she's an \"artist\" but she was not that great to listen to (read: sang like a hyena) and it was VERY distracting and annoying.    The entire parking lot is blocked off for valet only, which irritates the crap out of me.  You have to park across the street and play Frogger to get to the restaurant, unless you want to pay some punk to park your car 10 feet from where you pulled up.  If they wouldn't block off the parking lot for valet, there would have ben PLENTY of parking (there were maybe 10 cars).  Literally just a cash grab. I do not just throw my keys to some schmuck for the heck of it, and give him $$ on top of that.    The Prime Vig Dip was on a super crusty roll (they toasted it but perhaps left it in too long), and the prime rib was cold, dry, and bland. I hate to say it, but I've had better Prime Dips at a food truck.    I'm writing The Vig off - there are many other places very close by that have better food, and won't force you to valet just so someone can make a couple more bucks.  Again, the service was decent (not great) but everything else was ho-hum.",

The skinny  My girlfriend and her Hawaii'n crew decided to meet up for a triple date about a week ago I have been anticipating this trip so much, I have been researching the menu and drinks. I originally wanted to go with Mac and cheese as I keep reading reviews but I was very hungry and love al pastor so I decided on the pastor street tacos (10$) and the Harlem shake (9$) our waitress was amazing she was always there when the table needed something. The Harlem shake was great but I didn't realize it came in a martini glass so I got laughed at by my group for having such a sex and the city drink lol. To me the best part of the meal was the banana bread pudding dessert (7$) the soft warm gooey taste of fresh banana bread pudding with a scoop of delicious vanilla ice cream everyone in my table enjoyed it. The bad  Parking is horrible I ended up parking near a church and trekked my way over no big deal. The pastor tacos, for a lack of a better word was a huge let down not only did they look smaller than the appetizers, the al pastor was burnt and tasted like steak not like it had been marinating for days tortillas were a bit cold so made them taste different than they should. I was finished with my meal and still very hungry :-( I ended up trying a few other things from my tables order but felt bad.  Overall  I will be back to check out happy hour but for my money and appetite I will be going elsewhere for dinner. Great service staff.",

There's an outdoor and indoor area that are both pretty cool and great to hang out in as long as it's not summer in the blazing heat.  As a group, we shared the wings, nachos, and sweet potato fries. If you are already there and need an appetizer to get, I definitely recommend the wings. The fries are fine but not better than you would get anywhere else. Nachos were okay as well. I think as a group, we enjoyed the wings the most.  For the entree, I got the mac and cheese with bacon and oh my gosshhh. It is sooo goood. I already love mac and cheese because it has two of my favorite things (carbs & cheese), but the addition of bacon and whatever else they put in there was awesome. Just know that it is VERY heavy and unless you are hungry, you wont be finishing this meal in one sitting.",

Cheesy tater tots to start were amazing. The Moscow Mules were to die for.  Pad Thai was super delicious and SO HUGE it took a whole box to get it home. The macaroni and cheese is fully customizable, so bacon.   There are lots of different places to sit inside and outside, so I imagine that every experience is new and fun with the change in ambiance. The fire pits looked inviting on a cold night.",

Table setup for a group over 4 to 6 would be difficult on the inside. Service was spotty, seemed like they could use 2 more waiters. Food was fantastic though! Very good portion and great quality.

The Vig is really a great little spot.  Plenty of seating, with a full bar and menu.  Staff here is awesome, and I love the way the place is decorated.  Enormous patio, decent bar seating, and plenty of great people watching.  Menu has a variety of options, and we went with the Artichoke dip with chips.  I stuck with a resling wine, and it was great.  There's TV's at the bar, along with plenty of space to move about.  Place has a great feel, and I would gladly return in the future.  The parking here is a bit tight, and I did valet for only $3.  If you don't want to do valet, you can park across the street in the lot and stroll across.",

While it may just appear to be another trendy gastropub in Arcadia, it does provide good food, good drinks, and a fun vibe.  And if you're looking to save some cash, Local dines has a great deal for this place.  $30 for $15 (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.localdines.com%2F%3Fref%3D19485&s=abdeb6a30dcb98df050092e6650ca3d1e7975188a9a275c9f39145695d2818b1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">localdines.com/?ref=19485</a>).  I had a \"love me tenderloin\" sandwich.  The pork was cooked a little dry, but the dijonaise sauce, onions and mozzarella moistened it up and added some great favor to the sandwich.  The pretzel bun was nothing short of awesome.  And I certainly couldn't say no to a side of sweet potato fries (one of several side options).  My friend had a burger and fries which he seemed to enjoy.  Like a lot of places in Arcadia, it's interior is kind of small but there is a large outdoor seating area.  The parking lot is also very small and you really can only park by using the free valet.  It's also right next to a neighborhood, so you'll see some  My only complaint.  The server has a little less than stellar.  While he seemed nice.  He disappeared after our food arrived, and we didn't see him again until we finished eating.  Would've been nice if he checked on us once or twice in between.",

She never introduced herself so I'm going off the name on the check. \"Glow\" was our server and she was great. Our group of 5 was seated immediately and she pretty much just left us alone to chat it up but was there when we needed her. Fantastic! The food however wasn't that great, like I remembered. PC had the vanilla braised short rib tacos and actally said there was too much meat! Thats a 1st but she liked them. TH had the blackened chicken sandwich and liked it. JM had the mac n cheese. It was creamy and she liked it as well. I personally think it would have been better had she added the chicken or chorizo to it. Mom and I split the prime rib dip on a pretzel bun. It came out well done, soggy and barely any meat. The menu said medium rare. Glow asked how everything was and we asked if we could trade it for the turkey cranberry sandwich  instead. She immediately took it back and had a new sandwich in front of us in less than 5 minutes. It was much better but with the coleslaw on it, it was still a little soggy. The sweet potato fries were great but the dipping sauce had curry in it and that just wasn't my thing. All in all,  the food was pretty forgettable. I've been here before and remember the food being pretty fantastic so I don't know what happened. I'll definitely come back but maybe just for atmosphere and cocktails.",

To also draft up a specialty cocktail menu that actually looks and tastes appealing to me is a rare and beautiful thing. Mmmm basil strawberry lemonade.  Fries, portobello sandwich, korma, hummus platter - all of them hit the spot for a Friday night sampling. Though it was a bit busy (which was to be expected on a Friday night) and the waitstaff was a little stretched, the experience was fabulous.

When they do, they won't be able to hear you, so they'll throw their arms up in the arm and not bring you what you ordered, until the next bartender comes along and says their co-worker \"forgot\". Service here must be consistently horrible. I keep giving it another shot and always leave disappointed and in a worse mood than when I came.  True to form, the food was decent.  Not great, not good, but decent. But decent food + horrible service + attitude + getting elbowed in the head by the drunk guy standing next to you = no buenas dias for me.",

This place (in Arcadia) feels urban-hipster meets ultra lounge, but only because the dark bar area makes you feel hugged in anonymity, the booths create a sense of intimacy, but as you get closer to the windows and patio, the space opens up and feels far more festive.  On a dreary Thursday, I met a friend for Happy Hour to work through the day's torment, and was pleasantly surprised by $3.50 pints of Deschutes's Mirror Pond Pale Ale on tap! Yay, Happy Hour, and yay, draft Mirror Pond!  Surprisingly, I found myself scanning the bar menu and decided to snack on something while enjoying my frosty beverage.  Lo, and behold: Half-price noms!  The Trifecta was for me (three sliders with fries), and I was not disappointed with the pile 'o' fries and the tasty burgers.  A filling snack for the price of a USD Lincoln, and it kept me sober for the next two rounds to follow.  Our bartender was top-notch, with incessantly-fast service without hovering. (Thanks for not being there when I made my controversial remarks about wait staff, BTW!)  Short-and-sweet: Good food, marginal parking, excellent people-watching.",

    "text": "My wife and I frequent the Vig quite often, however this last trip has inspired me to write my first Yelp! review.  The food.    The music: eclectic, relaxing, and at a volume that allows conversation.  Last night (Tuesday) they had a live DJ scratching accompanied by a live musician who played the guitar and trumpet.  I'd go back JUST for them. The drinks: fairly priced, although we haven't made it for Happy Hour yet.   The bocce ball: among the best in town.  The food: fantastic.  I thought the prices were a bit steep for \"bar food,\" but this is not your average chicken strips and mozzarella balls.  We ordered the most opposite thing on the menu... VigAzz Burger and the Vigan... not quite Vegan.  Both were large portions and full of flavor.  It wasn't your everyday cheeseburger... trust me, my wife is a cheeseburger connoisseur.  Plus, they didn't skimp on the fries.  Why didn't I give the Vig 5 stars?  The Valet parking!  I understand the lot only has 15 spots, but there is an entire shopping center across the street with ample amounts of parking.  On Friday night when we went there, they had the empty parking lot roped off with a parking bouncer who stopped everyone from trying to enter saying they HAD to valet.  Then last night, a Wednesday night, they had Valet again... luckily no parking lot bouncer.",

I will indulge my peeps and meet them here although they ALWAYS feel bad for forgetting I am a snob that doesn't drink fake Malibu imposters.   Food wise, their happy hour menu is good and decently priced. Just odn't order it to go or they will charge the non-HH menu price. Vings are quite tasty and spiced just right. I always get the guac and chips and sliders get a thumbs up as well.   The patio is a great place to be during the spring and late fall when the weather is probably what heaven is like 24/7. Lots of tables, a cozy little area near the gas fireplace and bocci ball on the side. They also have a bar on the back patio which opens up during private patio parties and late night... Sundays during the day, also.",

The place is classy, chic and cozy- something you would imagine in a more posh neighborhood, however its just a neighborhood lounge. Plasmas with all the games, attentive bartenders, a cool crowd, lounge-y music, great fire pits and a nice back patio (my only concern is when its 5000 degrees outside in the summer, what happens?)   Another bonus to this place??? BOTCHI BALL (spelling?). I have never seen that in my life but it was quite entertaining.  What better than get drunk and then exercise under the stars?! Genius.  Why this place is really a 5 star joint and not 4... the drinks. They are so cheap! I bought 3 rounds- beers, premium top shelf drinks and the tab was only $35!!! Phoenix is the land of milk and honey of cheap prices!  DO come to The Vig. It is awesome!  BTW, kudos to the lady at the end of the bar wearing sunglasses all night. You reminded me of Chyna the wrastler. Talk about celebrity sighting... muhahaha.",

    "text": "I figure it's time to review The Vig.  I've been there probably 10 times between the Arcadia location and the Uptown, and Sweet Pea and I met the gang up at Arcadia on Saturday night.  Let me just say, I like The Vig- I don't love it.  In fact, I hated it the first couple of times I went there...more about that in just a minute.  I am not in love with the place like so many are, it just fills a niche.  It's centrally located, it has a patio, drinks, some OK food, etc.  I don't care about the clientele, whether it's hipster dbags or whatever- if I like the place and I'm with my crew, I don't really care who else is around.  The problem with the place is the service.  It's not just indifferent, or bad, it's almost impossibly TERRIBLE.  My second experience at The Vig caused me to almost never return.  Sweet Pea and I were there on an afternoon, the place was pretty empty, and we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally reached out and grabbed a waitress's arm to get her to acknowledge us.  The waitstaff literally stood around chatting, and several of them looked at us as they walked by and kept on walking.  I mean, I've had better service at brasseries in Paris.  Saturday was no different.  We sat outside, this is before it even got busy, and didn't see waitstaff for a half hour.  We sent someone in to the bar to get drinks.  We waved arms frantically as we saw waitresses in the distance but never coming over.  Finally, I yelled out \"excuse me!\" to a busboy passing by and asked him if there was indeed waitstaff assigned to our section that evening.  He went off to get someone, and I watched her come out and start down the row of tables, stopping at each one, refreshing drink orders, taking food orders, and finally she's at the table right next to ours...and...this is where it gets good...SHE TURNS AROUND AND LEAVES.  I mean, it's like she's trying to avoid us at this point.  I had to send the busboy back after her, and when she finally showed up- no apology, no acknowledgment...actually, she seemed annoyed to have to even come to our table.  We were all being so nice to her when she did finally come, I had to ask why we were kissing this woman's a$$- so she would deign to come back to our table and wait on us???  Man that's messed up.  Can it be that hard to find waitstaff who is both attractive enough for this super hip trendy place AND can serve me food and drinks in a reasonable amount of time??  I guess so.",

It is always my top pick (which Parlor has recently stole) and I generally always enjoy myself.  The parking sucks. You have to pay and they monitor the surrounding lots like they are the Mafia or something. The prices are great and the food is surprisingly good. The atmosphere is hit or miss depending on the crowd. Being a married 20-something, I am not a big fan of men old enough to be my father in True Religions crowding my space. The good news is, you can always count on the Arcadia cougars to distract the young guys from bothering you. :) Its a great local hang out and worthy of a Saturday night.",

    "text": "I gotta say, the difference between The Vig on a chill night and The Vig on a packed night is, well, night and day.  They'd might as well call it The Zoo on your average Fri-Sat-Sun.  First, on a packed night you have to run The Gauntlet to get from the front door to the back patio.  It's about five feet wide from bar to booth, and reeks of Hidden Fantasy.  I have never before had to contort my elbows and shoulders in so many ways to avoid brushing up on fake titty.  Relief hits you when you make it back outdoors.  To the romantic patio, with its fireplace, cozy chairs and christmas-lit desert trees, that brings out the worst in every horned up yuppie jackass.  I've never seen so many horrified young women pulled into laps on couches before.  Maybe the half-priced wine all day has something to do with it, but by 8pm Sunday that patio reminds me of the reptilian scene from Fear and Loathing.  But damn if the place ain't great on a normal night.  I've brought dozens of friends here from out of town and they leave thinking Phoenix is actually a town chock full of swank bars with hip decors.  The food's pretty good when they have time to get it right, too.  Staff's great.  Just catch em on a slow night.",

We ordered drinks from the server who brought them from the inside bar so we could not see them being poured or who had access to them before delivering to our table. After just one Cosmopolitan I was barely able to walk and got very sick later than night. This has never happened to me before and I'm concerned something was slipped in my drink. Not necessarily by staff but possibly a patron at or near the bar before our drinks came to us. Thank god my girlfriends were there to get me home safely. Just a lesson learned to always keep an eye on your drinks from the moment they are poured... No matter where you're at!",

    "text": "I decided to try the Vig after hearing good things and conveniently having a credit from local dines ($15 for $30) and figured it was a good excuse to try it. I think I made the mistake of telling the waitress that I had the certificate from the start because it requires an 18% gratuity to be added automatically and I think this gave her the ok to give some pretty shitty service. Definitely not the place I would recommend if you are in a rush to get somewhere (which we were, unfortunately). It took almost 2 hours to receive our meal and pay for the tab, we could never find her or wave her down to ask for refills or the check and she acted uninterested to be helping us in the first place. If the tip is already included I still expect to get the same amount of service as if you have to work for it. I also don't understand companies that put out coupons or deals and then the employees practically eye roll you when you use them. Very irritating.   Now, if I block out the service issue and think just about the food then this place definitely would deserve more stars. Food was delicious, good portion and decent prices. I had the turkey sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, both of which were very tasty although I wasn't very fond of the dipping sauce with the fries. Tasted like cumin? Not sure, wasn't my thang though.",

Mark and I  shared a bottle of the Sextant Zin and it didn't disappoint. Sextant was rich and jammy, complimenting the entree perfectly.

    "text": "I'll agree with those who find this place to be too fancy in the pantsy. It's that slick, shiny, uber-hip sort of setting where people who have shit which does not stink go to be seen having a drink. I'm going to have to disagree though with people claiming it's \"Scottsdale\" in Phoenix... strongly.  I'm sorry, but new tacky money originated in Phoenix. Just drive around the Biltmore and have a look at some of the houses that haven't been remodeled in 30 years... you can do the same in West Paradise Valley. And Phoenix continues to house many of the young financially elite in places like Arcadia and in the areas where the restored classic homes of the old arts district downtown meets up with the new \"Urban\" and \"Modern\" blocky construction that's so in fashion these days...   I'll admit that Scottsdale - especially North Scottsdale is home to some of the biggest douchefucks and plastics around, but I'm tired of people (even I'm guilty of this) calling Scottsdale out as the douche capital of the world. Personally, I find Phoenix snobs to be a bit more insufferable because they point fingers having no clue that when they point a finger there are 3 more pointed back at them and that they are what they claim to detest.  There are plenty of douchey snobs with too much money, Affliction shirts and expensive jeans living all over the valley. They don't all come from Scottsdale - in fact, most of the Scottsdale douches hang out in North Scottsdale and don't even go to places like The Vig.   No, the Vig is full of Phoenix douchebags and plastics when it is full... When it isn't full, I still don't like it. I had a simple grilled cheese there and it was awful. I guess wealthy people see eating as an opportunity to work hard. This sandwich was difficult to chew - a grilled cheese. What the hell is up with that? I also felt very uncomfortable eating here - the atmosphere simply wasn't very inviting. The place was pretty much empty on this occasion and wandering around outside and in, looking at all the available seating - none of it spoke to me asking me to take a load off.  Everything here looks pretty spiffy though - even if a bit pretentious. I can't say I'd ever make this joint a regular hangout of mine and to be quite honest, I regularly turn it down when it's suggested in favor of something less snobby and more comfortable. So - customer base aside, I give this place 3 marks. It's just not my style. It's nice though and if you like it, you'll be right at home with the people who go here.",

You HAVE to love that.) into an uber-trendy hot spot, complete with an awesome outdoor fireplace and great drinks. It's a great, great spot to take out of towners and sit outside during our beautiful Arizona winter.   BUT, it's bordering on Scottsdale/frat boy/cougar-land. Invading my beloved Arcadia.   I can deal with that.  It's the food that's the problem.  The minced up chicken sandwich, in particular. (Not sure what else to call it.)  I asked the waiter if I could get it without the these days prerequisite pears included, which in my imagination, were sliced on top of it or something. His response? \"No. It's all kind of ground up together in the chicken.\"  Ground up, indeed. The sandwich came and it was this chicken pieces, press board kind of filling. It was really dang gross and reminded me of a scene from Sweeney Todd. I'm REALLY easy-going about food and it was the worst sandwich I've ever had. I kept thinking about it later and throwing up a little bit in my mouth.  Having said that, I do keep going back. Even though I'm going to die crossing 40th Street one day.   Just stay away from that chicken sandwich. Weird, man.",

As I hadn't been here for a while   ( a year?!), the menu was refreshing plus daring. Speaking of risk, I ordered a Vigaz burger with sweet potato fries. Hamburger was prepared to order yet bun could use improvement. Would locally baked rolls hold up better? Fries were perfect with a tasty peppery Russian dressing.  So eats are decent.  However the bartenders could SMILE. Ok, I'm old  school plus bartended thru college.  We smiled and made small talk with  folks who were not gabbing in groups. Point: when I  saw a to go order, I  wished this had been my choice. Kinda unusual that the friendliest guy is  the valet ( who you pay $4 with tip.) Please work on the PR.",

But the Vig is one heck of a place to take a date for sweet potato fries and good wine!  And atmosphere...  The Vig is like so many other places that try to trend out a wine loving crowd and you will note that there is wine for days!!!! I had the Chilean Pinot Noir by the glass.  Very nice and about $13.  I want to talk though about my favorite item in the Vig...the ladies room. Ladies, you know that this matters...  Space, sanitation, and scandal!  When I went there was no shortage of any of these.  I do wonder how it all turned out for Kelsy and James... Hold on...back to the venue...  The Vig is a mature, merlot of a place with lots of air to allow it to breathe as you inhale the masterful meals and mix and mingle with new found friends.    I don't like the parking scenario at the Vig.  I parked in the large parking lot across the street but only realized that this was the official allotted space when I somehow detected a very small arrow on a traffic cone that said \"Vig Parking\".  You have to be kidding me. Please use the appropriate marquee to let us know where you are, Vig...  Sheree, thanks.",

I was with a large group and we enjoyed a patio table and the bocce courts. My friends and I mainly had wine and beer, but the menus for both had a nice selection.   The big drawback for me, though, was the service. Our waitress was completely overwhelmed and was rarely sited. We wanted to order food but we were never quite able to track her down again. While the food is supposed to be good here, we were never able to find out.  Still, the outdoor patio is charming and the bocce court is a nice touch. Will most likely come back, but I do wish they could better coordinate service.",

Let me tell you how excited I am that their Central location is siphoning off some of the customers ... it's slightly less crazy up in there. Yes, I'm a curmudgeon, I admit it.  The Vig's food, though a little limited in options, is all fresh and satisfying. Sunday I had the grilled chicken sandwich with the mixed fries. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the veggies crisp and everything competently prepared. Big props especially for the $5 Bloody Marys ... it's what earned them that 4th full star. Just the right amount of spice and not too boozy.  We usually visit for dinner, and my husband was convinced they did brunch on Sundays. They do not. However, they did have one special \"breakfast\" sandwich, or you can get the burger with an egg on it for an a.m. protein fix.",

    "text": "It was a warm sunny Sunday, and with out of town friends in tow, I chose The Vig. Having never been there it was chosen solely by reputation and lots of good word of mouth. We also wanted someplace to enjoy with a patio. We self parked and were quickly greeted by the valet who wanted the keys and offered a ticket, that's fine, and he was very polite.  Upon entering My first impression was great, they offered a 45 minute wait for a table, that didn't seem to bad, as the Vig had a great Vibe. The live band on the patio mid day Sunday was a nice touch, and something not seen most places.  The host suggested our large group take the corner of the bar as she was about to seat the girls sitting there. That also was a nice touch. The ambiance was great and the lively atmosphere kind put me at ease and in the party mode at the same time. The First snag came with the party mode because bar service was sluggish at best, and I cant stand to wait for a drink or compete with the regulars and hot chicks for drinks. Thankfully after the regulars and hot chicks got there drinks we were served. We all wanted margaritas and wine, and come to find out both were on special. NICE and worth the wait !!!. Once seated in a tight booth by the door we ordered appetizers and lots of them, most were good, but the tandoori flat-bread was stellar an easy 10, but the sliders hovered near a 5 on a ten point scale. I wasn't fast enough for a taco but heard they were great. Why have I waited so long to get to The Vig? I have no Idea, but it will only be a week before I return.",

I also like that you can get better than average bar food until late and there are so many places to sit, you'll never have an issue with waiting.  Their food is okay, but nothing spectacular.   I used to live in Arcadia, and I miss it every day. If I were to move back to Phoenix/Scottsdale- I would never even consider a different neighborhood. Across the board, it is the friendliest and most beautiful neighborhood in Maricopa County.  That being said- The Vig represents the lame element of the neighborhood. People with too much money and bad taste. I think someone else called it \"schmoozy\" and that's exactly it!  As a neighbor, we usually rode our bikes- so I can't speak to parking. Do they not still have the shuttle?  Give me The Great Escape, JTs or Postinos any day.",

I am not saying i don't like this place  . . . . but for being in Phoenix there were a ton of Scottsdale LA Fitness guys from my gym there, weird?  Anyway time for my real review.  They have awesome happy hour food at cheap prices.  So a great place for dinner/hh.  When the weather is nice its good to go, since the majority of the bar is outside.

A mediocre burger, an adolescent grilled cheese (with American cheese, on white bread, with crusts cut off), a split side salad composed mostly of Iceberg lettuce, and a few drinks = $100+. Um.... NO.  The menu straight up sucks for vegetarians, despite the little \"We can accommodate vegans, just ask!\" blurb on the menu. I shudder to think what that might entail. Certainly, more Iceberg lettuce.   I hate that the parking is mostly monopolized by the valet service. Pretentious and unnecessary.  The drinks were meh and the last one that came out wasn't even what I ordered.   If you have fistfuls of cash and a desire to see and be seen, then by all means, go to the Vig. But if you're just average, neighborhood folk who want to sit outside, have some yummy chow and get your drink on for a reasonable sum... keep walkin'.",

    "text": "Ok, so let me start by saying that I have been to The Vig before and had a great experience! On my first visit I had the Vigazz Burger which I raved about to many as one of the best burgers I had ever had. cooked perfectly and the accompaniments set it off as a standout.  Lastnight, not so much. It started with a good time at the bar while we waited for a table outside. We expected to wait a bit as the weather was so beautiful. However after 40 minutes and no update we decided we would take inside or out. I might add the only hostess in the building was not being assisted in any way with info. We saw her have to leave the front door to go looking for open tables many times leaving ungreeted guests. She was very nice and professional so I can't hold The Vig's staffing decisions during, \" In Season\" against her. Once we were seated It was very windy due to the dampeners on the vents being wide open and pointing straight down on the table. We were promptly and courteously moved to another table by the hostess. Keep in mind that a simple adjustment after closing will keep further guests from complaining. It wasn't the AC as much as the velocity.  This is where it goes down hill. Our server was overwhelmed, maybe another example of poor staffing. We ordered an appetizer as soon as we sat as we already had drinks. The smoked Salmon was great but you wouldn't know that because we were never checked on until it was cleared away. Also this means our dinner order was not taken until well after we had finished apps. Our fairly early dinner is now going on two hours without even ordering dinner yet. We both ordered and a temp was asked for on the burger. I ordered medium, needless to say it was well done and without the grilled onions and gruyere cheese would have been tasteless. I also asked for no bacon which I had to remove. Our server never came back to ask if we wanted another drink during our meal and when she did her check about how the food was we hadn't even started. I rarely review and only in an instance where something is truly standout in direct contradiction to it's reputation or my own past personal experience would I write a negative one. Our server, \"Glow\" indicated on check was inattentive and lacked service skills even taking into consideration the lack of staffing. Knowing when to ask for help is being a professional. In addition I'd like to add that no matter what a company's policy is on hair I think it's gross to wear your long flowing hair down while waiting tables. It may not be a county health policy as many like to state but it is an industry known practice to keep your hair tied up in some fashion.   We will hope for a better experience next time because we do love the Vig and the Patio.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner on a Sunday night without a reservation. We were seated quickly in the outdoor area which was cute & had laid-back loungey feel. In the middle was a fireplace blazing, and there were couches that people were hanging around on.   Started off with an order of pork nachos which was surprisingly good. I ordered the \"Vigan... but not quite Vegan\" sandwich (grilled portabello, yellow squash, roasted red peppers, onions, Barbarella, and sun dried basil peston on ciabatta). The sandwich was delicious, but I would skip the fries. The other entrees that were ordered were the Hot Chick sandwich (grilled chicken, arugala, roasted tomato & mozzarella, spicy avocado spread on ciabatta), Flatiron Steak Torta, and The Frenchy (prime rib on a french rolla with fontina cheese & au jus). Everyone loved their meals, but it was definitely a lot of food!  The inside bar area was more of a sports bar, but it was nice that you had the option of either type of scene. Overall it's a nice, more upscale looking place to eat & drink with good service & atmosphere.",

At first glance you can notice the kitchen prides its self for the presentation.  At first bite one can take in the many flavors and quality food. I had the shrimp and gnocchi,  that is complimented by a flavorful pesto sauce.

After ordering the nachos with guacamole on the side, the food runner seemed irritated when we mentioned that when he delivered them to the table.

He didn't even bring the side of it out either, until I reminded him. Im just glad no one at the table had an allergy. I'll definitely be back, but that experience wasn't how I wanted to start the night.",

Got an appetizer flatbrea- BBQ Chicken with jalepenos, cheddar cheese, red onions-- it was AMAZING. I even picked off some ingredients I don't like, but the taste was out of this world.  For dinner we both had 'The Hot Chick\" chicken sandwich. It was absolutely amazing. It had this spicy avocado mayo, and the fries were outstanding.  Our server was this adorable girl who was super helpful, kept a good eye on our table and made sure we had everything we needed.   The only reason this is 4 not 5 stars is because I personally didn't like how loud it was. Once it cools down I will definitely be checkin out the patio.",

    "text": "The Vig is one of those places where showing up on a Sunday afternoon will not only get you an insane $5 Bloody Mary, but also maybe even a spot on the patio. Housed along 40th Street just south of Indian School, The Vig is a neighborhood tavern offering up a casual yet modern atmosphere with great drinks and well priced eats. All of these perks have their downside, the parking. If you go early you can get a spot otherwise, it's pretty much valet only, so don't forget a few bucks for a tip.  Ask to be sat on the modish patio if you can, weather permitting. On my last visit the patio was vibrant with an attractive 30-something crowd. Once you're sat, the service is friendly and outgoing with well-paced timing between drinks and food.  The menu layout is fairly straightforward though all over the place in terms of style. Seems the chef is going for a broad appeal venturing from Greek to Italian with some Indian and Mexican influences thrown in. This tends to be a plus and a minus depending on your personal tastes.  A good example of this was the Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken ($10). Topped with baby spinach, sun dried tomatoes, paneer cheese, pear-cardamom chutney on naan bread; the pizza was complex and delicious. The sweet flavor of the chutney and tomato was a nice contrast to the savory chicken, cheese and crust.  More of a straightforward choice was the Trifecta ($10). You get three perfectly cooked mini burgers draped with American cheese, grilled onions, pickles and spicy mayo, served with French fries. Classic Americana, you can never go wrong with burgers and fries.  I didn't really understand the take on the Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake ($15). There are slices beautiful medium rare carne asada with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, cotija cheese and roasted tomato sauce, then they put it all atop a potato pancake. I guess I appreciate the creativity of the idea though it's not like you can pick it up and eat it like a taco. Believe me, this would have been wholeheartedly welcome since the potato pancake was waterlogged.  Another complete misfire was the Frenchy ($13). Their take on warm roast prime rib, pile it high on a gorgeous French roll then cover with fontina cheese and served with a side of au jus. Sounds like the perfect sandwich in theory, but to my disappointment, it was unsatisfying. Something went terribly wrong here since the meat was so perfectly cooked and tender, however it was completely void of flavor. The au jus echoed this, simply a cup of unseasoned beef stock. The only saving grace was the chewy French roll and the fontina; maybe a grilled cheese would have been better? The sweet potato fries that came with the sandwich had a perfectly crunchy exterior with a sweet and fluffy interior, some of the best I've had.  Even with a few food misses, the service, vibe and overall cool factor making The Vig a great place for a date or just to hang out.",

My friend had the market fish, similar to mahi mahi and absolutely loved it.  Randomly coming on a Tuesday night, we ran into the Tuesday special. A bottle of wine and an appetizer for $22!

    "text": "WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD IN YEARS!!! I took a long time friend out for a birthday dinner.  Let me start by saying the only saving grace was the outstanding server Aaron Barnett who was excellent and should find a manager to work under who matches his skill set.  We ordered an appetizer and some drinks.  We moved on and ordered a brand new item (we were told later) which was the flat iron steak.  Both steak dinners including the vegetables were cool and under cooked.  We immediately reported the poor meal to the waiter.  After about a half hour wait, they brought us two more meals which were also cold and under cooked exactly the same as before.  I sent mine back and my friend reported his to the manager -Jasmine as being cold, but he was starving and needed to leave soon and ate a small portion of the meal.  Another half hour passed and I received my replacement meal (salmon) and it was hot.  After 4 under cooked steak dinners and both he and I eating dinner 1/2 hour apart and almost two hours later the manager Jasmine came to our table to explain they just added the Flat Iron steak to the menu and they are having problems with it and no apology - at all.  Soon after our bill arrived.  Remember... all 4 steak dinners were under cooked and my friend only took a few bites and gave up.  We were charged full price and the bill showed an amount subtracted that should have been for 3 of the 4 bad steak meals.  Guess what - the math did not add up and we were charged 4 dollars more than we should have been.  The waiter and the manager Jasmine could not figure out how Jasmine did the math.  Simply, Aaron came back without an explanation, embarrassed and with the same bill.  At this point I gave up and could not wait to get home write this review.  I tipped Aaron 20% because he was the only one who knew his job.  The manager Jasmine did not care in the least about our experience -  side note, as we left Aaron approached us with a couple $1 dollar off drink coupons which I passed on. He also gave us his General Manager's Card which I considered both responsible and thoughtful.  The Vig took what should have been a wonderful birthday dinner and ruined the entire evening.  I wish we would have selected a better managed restaurant to celebrate at.",

    "text": "I have been to Vig for many an afternoon, happy hour, lunch and dinner. I live not far from there and I can promise this: The Vig is very, very popular.   The Basics: + Casual (like 85% of Phoenix). There are TVs inside. + HH is M-F 3-6pm. ($2 off cocktails, $1.5 off drafts, $1 off domestic beer & well drinks) + 1/2 priced wine on Sundays + Elvis Before Noon plays on Sunday (time varies depending season, 6pm in summer, earlier when it's not god awful hot.) Great cover band. If you come once you'll know the rotation.  + The Vig Rig will scoop up Arcadia residents. (Free!) 602-722-5976. Fr/Sa 5pm-2am. Su 2pm-10pm. + Parking is tight. Bring cash for the valet. Otherwise play Frogger and park across 40th street. Far enough from Mamma Mia that no one gets upset.) + And yes. That is a Vig cat you see leisurely making rounds. Don't pet him if you're allergic to cats. Stop complaining about it. + Follow them on Facebook to catch specials. (A current summer special is $4 Titos Vodka for the summer.) + Additionally look at their website calendar for deals. (Ex: Twenty-Twosdays = 1 app + a bottle of wine.)  SEATING Misters abound outside. Fireplace in the winter. Lighting almost makes you feel like you're in someone's backyard. Booths line one wall inside that seat four.  People really want to sit outside. ESPECIALLY when Elvis Before Noon plays. If you have any interest in nabbing a seat on Sunday come early. It's ridiculous. Otherwise there is a bar setup in the back. People have been known to dance in the middle of everything. Kind of like watching someone shimmy at a wedding. You don't want to watch, but you can't help stare, in open fascination with your mouth open.  FOOD Pretty good. And plenty of options for vegetarians and individuals who eat healthy. The sides are excellent to nibble on. (I'm a fan of sweet potatoes.) Can't go wrong with the guac and chips or \"double down\" hummus. Salads are delicious. My favorite is the prickly pear. Sharing is fun with the smoked salmon or deconstructed fish tacos. I've never met a daily flat bread I didn't like. (Note: These can be made vegetarian. The Vig will just remove meat. No additional customizations.) I've shared the banana bread pudding more times than I can count. (Shh!)  MISC This is a popular first date spot. I've run into other first dates here. I have NO idea why so many men want to take women here. Seating might be tough and you'll be hovering in the aisle trying to get a drink. Alternatively, you'll be seated up front waiting for a booth to open. (The Vig unfortunately doesn't have little beepers to hand out.)   This place is kid friendly. But only in the way people bring tiny human beings and sprinkle them in with a bar crowd. I have no idea why this happens.  And that's The Vig!",

We sat at the bar and ordered the following:  Chicken wings in Thai chile sauce - fried then grilled - blue cheese was very good - overall delicious! Rib basket with skinny french fries - excellent flavor and crispy flies Banana nut bread pudding with carmel sauce and vanilla ice cream - OMG  Great bar food and the drinks were interesting as well.  Suit and Tie - Oatmeal stout beer/grey goose cherry vodka, soda water and something else.  it was inventive and good.  it wasn't too sweet I had \"the Loop\" sauvignon blanc - actually the best SB I have ever had - very cirtrusy and cold.

The brussel sprouts were also burnt on the outside.   I can't see anything nice or interesting about this place.   Even worse, the parking lot is Valet Only. When I arrived, there was one car in the whole lot. I was about to park when the valet guy rushed up and said its Valet Only. I said to him \"you mean I cant just turn and park right here\"? I was 10 feet from the parking spot. He said he doesn't make the rules and the lot might get \"tight\" but if I want to self park I can go ACROSS the street. Purely stupid. I got out and he parked exactly where I was about to.   There are far better american restaurants and actual \"new American\" which this place is not.",

We got seated right away and had Britt as our server. She was one of the highlights of our trip-so competent and really knowledgeable about the menu.   We had the guacamole and salsa to start-both very spicy but really creamy and delicious. I had the Steak Melt and sweet potato fries which was so yummy but so rich it was hard to finish. One of my lunch partners had the Best Turkey sandwich which she described as delicious thanksgiving leftovers but unfortunately her pretzel bun was a bit stale. Another friend had the steak salad which she had only impeccable things to say.   All in all a good experience and I will be back",

I can't say enough great things about the service and the staff.  My friends and I had an excellent time.",

It's all been said before right?   Well this weekend I had the privilege of enjoying lunch at The Vig. AND WHAT LUNCH IT WAS! I had no idea their food was this delicious! UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLY DELICIOUS to be exact. I mean, my mouth is still watering and it's a day later....   We ventured out to the patio for a beautiful Sunday afternoon. They were not too packed, and we were seated right away. After deciding on beers for the fellas, and a half priced bottle of wine for the ladies, we all agreed that it was gonna be difficult to choose an entree from their menu as everything sounded awesome.   I ended up with the achiote salmon and chorizo arepa. WOW. asparagus, sweet corn cake with a hint of chorizo, and a wonderfully prepared piece of fish. This plate was UNREAL. Every bite was amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and mixed with the asparagus, sweet corn cake, pablano chile sauce, it was the perfect bite every time.   If you haven't figured it out already, I was flabbergasted. The deconstructed fish taco as well as the smoked pork tenderloin salad received similarly favorable reviews from my dining partners. All in all, a FABULOUS meal and now that I live around the corner and have the full monty on this place, I will be dining here often.",

Although its a popular spot I have always had luck finding a seat outside and under a heater lamp! There is always the Bocce ball track too if your conversation runs dry :)   Sweet potato fries are amazing as is everything I've had to eat there! Try to make it on a Monday for the burger and fries $5 deal!  There really is no point paying 7 bucks for Chipolte!   I really vibed with the DJ last time I was at The Vig.  It was like every song he plucked off my Top 25 Playlist and dedicated to me. (In the least narcisisstic way possible).    Only downfall is the parking. They do their best in the awkward corner lot but you are pretty much forced to valet. Good thing the Vig is always worth it!   *Feel free to keep the drinks coming too because the Vig Rig will take you home*  So convenient!",

Tons of seating, just a really nice ambiance. They had a band playing good music and I could see this being quite a good first date/romantic evening place.  However, I was just in town on business and on this particular Saturday night, I could just feel the schmoozy dude/ fake valley chick vibe. I guess if you're in to that vibe it might be cool, but it seemed like everyone was there to just be a scenester  and show off. I'm in for \"a night out on the town\", but maybe this felt a little too LA to me. Sorry LA.  The food was good, had the ribeye steak which was cooked properly with a great sauce on top, but the quality of meat was only so so. It also had cauliflower and potatoes on the side, both of which were good. There was a good selection of booze, and they carry Stella which is always my go-to beer to go with a steak. The price is quite reasonable, beer and a steak for $25 is okay in my books (or maybe I'm just used to Bay Area, CA prices?)",

Not just for a great bar vibe but for amazing food! I can honestly say I've never had a bad time at the Vig, I mean how many places can you say that about? I mean NEVER have I had a bad time. The staff is amazing, especially Mich Mich, so nice they named her twice. Get her section and you will have a unique experience to say the least, and in a good way. I frequent this joint 3 or 4 times a week and it's always a blast and something different going on. Whether it be the best Sunday in town with live music and 2 for 1 bottles of wine, or their regular week night specials with different flair on it each week.   The crowd is always great and different, eclectic. And it's always the perfect kind of busy. Botchy ball is a must and you can't beat the Vig ass Burger with a fried egg on top!!!!!! Or the Bread Pudding, don't get me started, I want it for my birthday cake!!! So if you haven't been in a while or you were just there last night like I was, get to the Vig again and again!!!!!",

On the two occasions I've been the food has been nearly satisfactory, if somewhat dry, though definitely over-priced for what was delivered.  The Vig Cobb salad was good, the \"Hot Vings\" are what you would expect for bar food, but the tenderloin was anything but tender, trending a bit more on the dry, slightly overcooked side.  Overall service left quite a bit to be desired.    The atmosphere can best be summed up by a comment overheard during our first visit in which a woman at a nearby table proclaims, \"what I love about this place is that its just like Scottsdale...only its in Phoenix.\"    The bocce is a good idea and the patio is nice.  But over all The Vig comes up short.  Attempting to make up for lacking substance with style that just doesn't cover it either.",

Now The Vig has been a neighborhood staple for years, a great place to drink and eat on the patio and meet friends for a game, but with this new menu revision, I am just loving the food.  Great job!

I couldn't believe it was soupy. I was hoping it would be baked which is always way better. Such a disappointment  since my mac and cheese on the stove turns out a million times better than what they gave me. Since I happen to be sick i was really thirsty and the waitress took forever after our appetizers came to refill my lemonade.  After she had realized I went through 2 glasses fast she started to get the hint to stick around.  But just b/c of that reason shouldnt keep a waiter or waitress around to see if we needed anything as a courtesy.",

    "text": "It makes me sad to have to write this update... Almost.  Let me just start by saying that I am not all that difficult to please, although my bf may disagree.  But seriously, I waitressed and cocktailed my way through college, both in bars and fine dining restaurants which makes me almost TOO forgiving when it comes to poor service since I know how many things can go wrong that aren't particularly the wait staff's fault.  This was not the case here.      We arrived on a Monday evening to meet some friends for dinner and drinks.  We chose the spot expressly for the fact that both my friend and I had purchased Care Cards that benefit charity while giving you a 20% discount at participating retailers during Oct 14 - 23.  The Vig claimed to be one of these businesses.  Our party turned into about 7, and I had been seated for 15 minutes before our server came over to ask if I was thirsty.  I ordered a bottle of beer.  I see her next about 10 min later when she is delivering food to the table, although my beer is no where in sight.  She asks my companion if they want another, I politely let her know that I still had not received my first.  ANOTHER 10 minutes goes by, and my beer is finally delivered to the table.  In the meantime, my food had arrived.  They changed the menu and took my beloved seared sea scallops off and replaced them with Pad Thai (WTF?! there is no shortage of Thai offerings in the neighborhood) but they did add a few more healthy salads which is nice so I ordered a deconstructed fish taco salad.  This was the standout of the evening, and the reason for the 2nd star.  It is one of the best salads (healthy) I have had in recent memory.  Huge piece of perfectly grilled fish, crunchy salad with cilantro, salsa, guac, and black beans and cute little hot corn tortillas on the side.    As the evening winds down, we ask for the check.  My friend had presented her Care Card when she first arrived with her husband, yet when the waitress brought the bill, there was no discount taken off.  Fine.  We see her about 5 min later and remind her.  10 min later she comes back with a revised bill with a whole $4.20 taken off.  Our check was $200.  I was no math major, but come now. After another 5 minute wait, I asked her why only $4 was taken off, she informed me bc only what the Care Card holder ordered had been discounted.  This was also bullsh!t because my friend ordered more indeed.  I asked to speak to the manager, and informed her that I also had a card.  Nowhere on the exclusions did it say: will only discount on the items the card holder orders (the nerve!).  We are all one party, with one check - and if you are participating in a charity benefit- effing do so!  They are providing you with free advertising and 7 customers you would not have had otherwise on a Monday night!  I have to use the restroom, so my friend says she will speak to the manager.  I walk back to the table to see a brown haired dude (the manager) rolling his eyes as he walks away assuring my friend he will \"take some more off\".  We wait another 10 minutes.  I wish I was joking.  She comes back and presents the bill with $15 taken off the total.  I have never experienced such poor service and attitudes.  Sadly, this was not the first time this has happened in the year that I have lived down the street and probably frequented this place 2-3 times a week at my peak infatuation with the Vig.  But just like most relationships, what starts out all champagne and roses eventually turns into complacency and laziness which is why I am dumping the Vig.  It's not me, it's you.  You may look cute on the outside, but your personality sucks and I certainly won't introduce you to anymore of my friends.  I will never date you again, and I vow the only time I will ever contact you  in the future is if I'm already drunk and decide to meet up with you late night, but it won't mean anything.",

We sat in one of the long booths on the patio. We were greeted by Meow Meow, The Vig's resident cat. Well, my friend and I are crazy cat ladies so we just loved that.  The menu, looked amazing. I will have to go back many times to order everything I wanted.  I could not hold back from ordering their Mac and Cheese. Got it with bacon and chicken.  I'm so glad I got it.  This Mac and Cheese was very good. The portion was huge so I was more than happy to take the rest home with me.   Looking forward to going back and playing corn hole.

We started with the flatbread of the day which was BBQ chicken. Delicious. I ordered the seasonal shrimp salad with prickly pear vinaigrette. My hubs got the turkey sandwich on a pretzel roll. The food was great. We were both pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was. Yes it's a bar, so it's not the absolute best food I've ever put in my mouth. But it was damn good bar food and I would come back for the food and atmosphere in a heartbeat.   Also our server was nice and attentive and the prices were great. For an app, two entrees, and two beers each it was $60. That is dirt cheap for Chicago standards. If I lived in Phoenix, I would be a regular.",

The food and service here was awful, all except for the girl at the door the night we were there, which was on February 16th she was pretty nice. She was they only exception though, the guy at the bar was such a flirt, but in a very uncomfortable way. Then after waiting for our party at the bar we decided to move to a table and enjoy our drinks there. Then we come to realize that our server was a real stuck up and rude girl, that was nowhere to be found when needed and that took forever to come back to our table for assistance or further request! I don't think that's acceptable, we had to get other servers attention to get things for our table. Then after all that hassle, we stumble upon the nastiest nachos ever and okay drinks and wine, this was just plain awful and not worthy of your time nor mine!! Never again, never again!!!!!",

All of the food was really good.   The hostess was sweet and our server was on top of her game,  too bad i cant remember her name. I know shes Asian mixed blonde hair with tats, we had a mini convo about Asian moms... She checked on us once in awhile checking for drinks and if we wanted more food. I like that she didnt bother us too much and even reminded us that  the happy hour was about to end in case we needed to order more food from the hh menu.   Also, its great that they have valet, and the valet guys were all smiles even though it had been raining that day. Oh and my hubby rides a motorcycle and they let him park close to the door since there was enough space. We were very impressed with this restaurant and cannot wait to go back!",

Like, the food / drinks / dessert I tried were satisfactory but the seating was awkward and cramped due to the traffic.    I suppose the difference between this place and somewhere like - Postino - is even though both are typically packed, Postino delivers like no other with their bruschetta and wine... this place just shows up.  The service was forgettable and thus the three star rating... meh - don't go out of your way to check 'em out.",

I'm not sure if everyone else had this problem, but it was disgusting how many flies came to eat when the food came.  We even asked if we can rearrange some tables at the side of the lounge area (empty at the time) that would've been perfect for our group and they wouldn't let us.  All the tables inside are small booths of pretty much the same size.  Definitely NOT the place to have your party in the summer!  They don't even fill your glasses with ice water regularly.",

The portions of food per order were more than expected. I had ordered the holy Mac n cheese with jalapenos. The order was a large bowl... Much bigger than I thought it would be. The cheese was rich and flavorful.  The food was heavy but really tasty -- a must try!  I think the service could be improved -- felt as if we would not get our waitress back for half hour if we didn't place our order when she arrived.  The wait time was longer in some cases. But that was excusable for the tasty experience.",

Maybe because it's close to my office for a convenient happy hour?  Could be.   Either way, can't go wrong here.   This visit was a Sunday brunch after church.  Had a Bloody Mary with a little too much horseradish, then switched to mimosas.  Yum.    Food was also very good.    Always love the Vig!",

Which is free at lunch, but costs @ Dinner. Any way 3 of us were lined up,they must of been a little over whelmed 11:30am. We had our cars parked and proceeded inside. Nice restaurant, very cozy inside despite the Concrete walls. I see it as very 60's modern and I love it!. We were seated where inside meets outside, the patio is wonderful. It is my favorite part of the setting.  Food was very good,awesome actually.  The entire party really enjoyed what they got. Our server was nice, but he was on a very slow mode. I know we waited over 30 min for our food to come out. There was 4 of us and it was lunch time. But, I really think they need more servers. Because, they really seemed over whelmed. Luckily we had a lot of time for a long leisurely lunch. But, had we of been on a schedule it would not of been cool.  Bathrooms are clean ,nicely designed ,but very dark. Yes I looked good in the mirror, but reality was it was sunny outside, and I was not going to look so good out there!  Oh well! Heehee I  will diffidently come back. I like the atmosphere and the Food is good. Though you spend a little more than you would may have planned because, then you have to tip the valet a few $$. So be prepared for that. I was lucky I had some cash with me. More and more I never carry cash.",

I haven't been here in a while and the only main attraction was to come see Elvis Before Noon play (amazing band BTW). Service was awful. I sat at my table for at least 15 min before the server noticed me. After we placed our drink and food order, she never checked back up on our table. We were done with both our food and drinks and had to flag down the host to even get our checks. I absolutely will not be back.

This is the worst customer services I have ever received from an american restaurant. Waitresses were non friendly, never smiled once except when giving us our check, brought us only 2 water when we had 3 ppl, never asked how I wanted my steak or eggs, demanded to take my meny back even when she saw me still lookin at it. Attitude was horrible overall. You can tell she doesnt want to serve us. Front check in girl gave the same vibe. Only time she smiled was when we left, and it was a forced smile.  3. Food was okay. Somewhat overpriced for the amount given. Steak was half the size of what you would normally expect. And NO steak sauce even though they served steak. Really?  Pros: 1. Nice ambient atmosphere. 2. The mexican cleaning ladies. They were probably the only friendly workers in this place.   Never coming back here again. Management need to re-train their employees in the art of customer services because it SUCKS.",

So we went down the street to The Vig. There was a 25 minute wait. But it was inside and they were serving brunch so we stayed. My friend ordered the Montecristo and she said she really enjoyed it it was good. I ordered the French onion burger, received the wrong burger and sent it back, the French onion burger with onion rings turned out to be one of the best burgers I've had in a very long time. The onion rings were one of my favorites from anywhere crispy and delicious. The Berger said it had caramelized onions and it did. That's an important issue with me because I love onions anyway except if they are raw and crisp. A lot of places claim to have caramelized onions and they're actually just cooked. But the Vig did it right.  We ordered the coconut French toast to share. Honestly the dish was a bit of a letdown. They use a very thick bread and maybe it did not get soaked enough to be French toast, but it came out very dry. Also since it's called coconut French toast there is very little coconut and coconut flavor. That dish could be improved upon but Certainly not a horrible dish at all. Even though they were extremely busy the staff did a great job getting to us when they could and everybody seem nice. Just a note that it was valet parking only.",

We wanted to sit outside since we had just been driving for a few hours so we chose the courtyard area lounge area. I loved how bright and airy it was out there! You couldn't tell it was a million degrees outside which is also a plus but I quickly noticed that all the cushions were really dirty looking.  Our server came and took our drinks and chatted for a few when she brought them back. She was super friendly and told us were we could buy that particular beer from since we loved it so much! I ordered the brussel sprouts and the Asian salad and my boyfriend had the Cobb salad. My salad was great! Everything from the presentation down to the dressing. It was very fresh and colorful. The brussels were also good! I like to try them everywhere to get new cooking ideas :) The Cobb Salas was the same- super fresh and colorful! He really enjoyed it.  I know they have different locations but this one was awesome besides the maintenance on the things I noticed like the rust in the bathroom, touch up painting, the gross looking patio fabric and other easily fixable things. I am sure it's not as noticeable a night but it's something I noticed.",

The meat was cooked well and the Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese were delicious. My family ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and the short rib melt. Both raves about those dishes! The fries were crispy and some of my favorites! They even brought me a piece of the 7 layer chocolate cake for my birthday which was rich and decadent. Thank you for a great birthday!",

First, the happy hour drink menu is wonderful (cocktails for me and beer for my husband) plus their happy hour food specials are really great as well. The guacamole is one of my favorite guacs around and it perfect as a snack. The bartender was super attentive and noticed every time our drinks were low, always asking us if we were ready for another round. I definitely recommend to our friends and neighbors as one of the best happy hours in Arcadia and their brunch is really amazing as well!",

    "text": "Overall Customer Experience: Beyond Extremely Poor Total Time: 1hr 30 minutes Food quality: just ok Food arrival timeframe: fine Host: fine Server: Nonexistent Dined 6/22 Cashed Out 9:48pm Balance Paid: $78.19 Tip: $0   Our receipt shows that our server for tonight was named Sean. However, it felt like we received more interaction and pleasantries with the food runner rather than our server named Sean.   (0 minutes in) First, Sean told us the water was on the way after we gave him our appetizer and bottle of wine selection.    (5 minutes in) 3-5 minutes pass while Sean prepares the wine but still, no water arrived even after he finished pouring our wine. Then our appetizers arrive but no Sean, and no water.   (20 minutes in) At this point, 15 minutes have passed without Sean checking in or asking if we wanted to put any requests in for entrees, regardless of our menus being placed away from us at the edge of the table as though indicating the table was ready to order.   (25 minutes in) Finally, Sean comes back to take our orders and also asked if waters were served. Again, Sean said waters were on the way and then left to place our order with the kitchen.   (45 minutes in) A few minutes after our dinners arrive and again cannot find our server to request silverware and napkins, in addition to the waters that Sean said were on the way. After waving him down for assistance, he asked how the food was only to realize we haven't eaten yet.   And yet, even at that moment, there was no apology or water. Sean finds silverware and then leaves again, saying that the water will be on its way and then he goes back outside.     (1hr 5 minutes in) We took around 20 minutes to eat and watch Sean serve his other tables outside and also chat with his friends who were seated in the booth behind us.   I am certain Sean overheard us guessing how many more times he would tell us water was on the way before we finished dinner because at that time when he asked if we had water yet and we said no, he actually came back in under a minute with a glass of water, in each hand; his own hands.   (1hr 10 minutes in) At this time, Sean appears at the table again and he doesn't ask if we are done eating or how the food was. His first question was, \"would you like your food boxed up to go now?\"   We never indicated we were ready to leave as we still had full glasses of wine and our dinner in front of us. --What about dessert?  Feeling rushed by Sean, he placed our food in boxes and then left back outside without providing us our first receipt to review. We finished our wine and had our payment ready but, still could not find Sean.   (1hr 25 minutes in) After everything we had endured, I left my table, stood in front of the POS system and waited for the first server that arrived to cash me out.   Without questioning the situation and with ninja-like movement, the cocktail runner printed out our final receipt and went back to serve cocktails without closing our bill.   Now, I am turning in circles looking for the nearest server, food runner, or dishwasher to help. Finally, another person walks out and behind the bar and assists with closing out our receipt.   (Total Time Wasted: 1hr 30 minutes)  Sean, if we somehow offended you from the moment you walked up to our table tonight, we apologize. If my Wonder Woman t-shirt offended you, I apologize.   If we kept you from going to meet-up with your friends who were sitting behind us the entire time we were seated, we'll apologize for that as well even though your priorities while you're on the clock as a server should be serving everyone equally, not just your friends.    To say this Customer Experience was extremely poor is an understatement. I see I'm not the first to experience similar issues with staff.  This experience made us feel as those we were a bother and not welcomed whatsoever from the moment we sat down.   There were so many areas of opportunity to own up to the situation rather than completely throwing in the towel and rushing us out the door.",

Although it made it quite loud and conversation was not easy, that's to be expected. I was surprised by thier lack of fans or cooling system. It was extremely hot if not close to the outdoor bar. My suggestion would be to add more cooling. We sat under a tree and it shed on to the table, not fun when leaves fall into your food and drink. We ordered a few items and I was not impressed by the food for the price. Only good item was the dip.",

Not only that, but as we didn't opt for the rental car, the bar actually has a van service that will pick you up from the hotel and return you, happier, fuller, and slightly more enebriated.  The back veranda takes up an entire block and has great music, lighted wonderland, and bochee ball (sp?).  The interior is posh, modern, but a bit on the crowded side.  Its worth the wait for the outdoor seating.  The food was insanely good.  Flatbread tandori chicken pizza.  Lamb and almond brittle salad.  Achiote salmon with chorizo filled arepa. Topped off with some sweet potato fries.  The wine list was a great compilation.  Somewhat smaller selection, but we never hit a bad one and sampled quite a few.  I love a bar that filters in a good way!  Not sure how often I will be in Pheonix, but I will definitely be hitting the Vig again when I return.  Oh, and kudos to the owner of the Vig Rig and marketing to those trying to escape the slow spa experience for the night :)",

The parking absolutely sucks (so pay the measly $3 and valet it bitches!).  Things I like about The Vig: - great outdoor patio with smoking section - great outdoor fireplace renders the patio warm & comfortable in the cooler months - consistently good service; attentive, affording, knowledgeable & friendly - hot bear DJ on Friday nites - bacci ball court on the side - Trivial Pursuit cards at the tables  Their sweet potato fries with curry-mayo ROCK MY WORLD, and the grilled chicken sandwich ain't bad either!  In fact, all of the food I've tasted here is awesome.  You can buy wine by the glass or the bottle and heir beers on tap provide a nice (if not somewhat mass-appeal) offering. I usually opt for the Stella on tap, but that's me.  All in all, great experience and very reasonable prices.  It gets VERY packed in the evenings, espec. Thurs-Sat and as I mentioned, valet is a must.",

Nothing mind blowing, but it is always consistent.  #3. Live entertainment (DJs and Bands throughout the week).  #4. Great atmosphere. Nice outside fire place and Italian lawn bowling.   Cons  #1. Parking is a pain. Don't drink too much or crossing the street over the checks cashed parking lot can be dangerous.  #2. Drinks are usually weak and somewhat over priced.  #3. The Arcadia crowd can be a little much. You know old guys with young girls or cougars with young men. Once again, if that is your thing you will love this place.   Overall The Vig is a pretty decent spot and I recommend everyone I know to try it at least once.",

We used the $3 on our drinks instead. The food was good. We got the artichoke dip, five spice edamame and the Frenchy sandwich and shared it all. We were pretty impressed with the food and liked the atmosphere. It was crazy loud in there even for a Sunday night but I suppose that's because it was half off wine bottles those nights. There was a band playing on the patio too. Luckily for the patio dwellers, there are misters that kept them cool in the 100-degree evening.  The Vig has its own scene going on. So if you're not one of the in-crowd, be prepared to be aggressive to get a drink at the bar. The hostesses seem a little cliquish as well.  Overall, it was money and time well-spent for two visitors from San Diego. We'd go back.",

I had a BBQ pork torta with sweet potato fries.  The fries were warm and they came with a special sauce.  The Torta was excellent mix of southwest and American.  It really was quite tasty and the price was good also.    Now the reason for the 3 star.  There is a strange vibe in this place.  There seems to be a lot of older guys and young women here.  The parking lot is full of Mercedes/BMW/Land Rovers so I am guessing that its a great place for older men to meet young women or vice versa.  If this is your type of thing then by all means this is the place.  Overall I say the best part of this place is the people watching.",

The outside, a plain, wood-planked facade on a lightly-traveled street, doesn't match the inside, a sleekly designed bar & dining area.  The inside, which looks straight out of scottsdale, doesn't match the more laid back neighborhood.  The menu, an ambitious attempt at upscale bar food with a touch of fine dining, doesn't match the bar atmosphere.    I went for lunch and had their house special burger.  It really was tasty, and paired with a few options, including a plie of shoestring fries or sweet potato fries, but, again, the identity crisis pops up.  It also comes with a little salad.  Salad?  With a burger?  I'm eating a huge chunk of meat and deep-fried potatoes and NOW I'm gonna start eating healthy?    The Vig tries to be so many different things at once, that it never really owns any one thing.  The face it shows is all Scottsdale- posh with a hint of fake.    It really is an establishment in an identity crisis.",

However, i MUST say they forgot Shrimp in my friends shrimp-something-pasta-special. I mean C'mon!!! We did get free desert out of this and of cuz they replaced his dish. My own Miso Salmon was not bad but i think rice it came with was super buttered up but tasted good. And all food came out blazing fast too.   What i was really bummed about that my Mojito as basically lemony water. I sent it back 2x till 3rd one was ok, JUST OK. I did get charged 2x for this though and did not feel like making a scene being with friends and all.   I did not come there for a crowd, but there we some girls in tight jeans there and some dudes, and some couples. I do not care much.   What is unacceptable is that Bar/Tavern has watered down drinks. That is BAD! I mean B A D !!! I am not a picky person but this is BS, pardon my English. AND i ended up paying 2x for this water. Bleah, doubt i will be back.  EDIT: I thought about it, compared to my other experiences i had at some other similar joints and i am bumping this one down a notch! Sorry The Vig, get your act together. Swanky decor aint cutting it.  Eugene",

    "text": "Just got back from The Vig (on a Wednesday night), and I must admit it was a damn good place.  First off, how can you not love a place with its own bocce ball court outside?  Second off, the menu is full of wonderful food selections, and it's really not that expensive (most items for under $10, including a damn good bacon cheeseburger).  Third off, three words:  sweet potato fries.  They were to die for.  I sat outside on the patio, which was a great atmosphere with lots of people gathered around their tables or sitting on the couches in the \"lounge\" area just having a good time with those they were with.  A mix of couples, girls on a \"girls night out\" and groups of people there after work filled the place.  Slightly more of an upscale crowd that what I'm used to (could be expected since it boarders the Arcadia district), but it did not seem that pretentious.  Most people were still in jeans, a prerequisite for most places that I go.  A good mix of people made this great.  Indoors included a long bar and plenty of booths for seating, complete with 2 large flat-screens for watching the game.  Full bar, good beer selection, a DJ that was spinning decent lounge-like tunes, and very attentive (and cute) staff.  Parking on the lot can be a bit difficult, since it is tiny and I think all valet, but there is plenty of parking across the street in the Bally's lot.  Pay attention to the signs, because on weekdays they might tow you if you are not parked in the right area.  Or you can avoid that all together and take advantage of their shuttle service on the weekends (call them for details).",

The back outdoor patio has a great atmosphere with glassed in fireplaces and lots of seating.  If you want to play some games they have bocce ball.  I went with my husband and we were sitting at a table and just kind of looking at each other like \"ok so what do we talk about now\".  Low and behold there were some trivia pursuit cards on the table.  We made up our own rules \"Ok if you ask a question I can't answer I get to ask you for another question one time\".  We had so much fun.  I think it's a wonderful place to frequent.  The food is wonderful and it's a great place to meet your friends.",

Having Stella on tap was a HUGE plus in my book...  great selection and even has a bit of a wine selection.

I would not hesitate to eat at a place that served burgers this good.   I didn't care for the server's demeanor - not a lot of grace or courtesy. This place is run more like a night club than a restaurant or bar.  It is a very good alternative to clubbing. They have a gorgeous patio that I would love to spend time at but it was too cold to sit out.  The noise inside was deafening.  I could not hear the people at my table and I'm sure that we contributed to the noise because we had to shout to each other to be heard. The accoustics were horrible.  The tables are cement slabs that didn't look like they could be cleaned very well.  This turns me off because my utensiles are placed on that unclean surface.  I'm not sure how bad that is if you compare it to eating on a picnick bench at the park but I didn't like it.   If it was not for the great burger I don't think I would return.  It is a nice looking place and it has some things to offer.",

The food is fantastic, not big portions but is good for my diet ;) If you want to try something different, I would recommend the nachos that come with fries (hashbrown like) that are super yummy! not good for the diet...

Good food and a cool, laid back atmosphere go a long way, but annoyingly slow and inattentive service go a long way too. We most recently had a group ranging from ten to fifteen, getting lots of food and drinks... well... attempting to get lots of food and drinks... and the service was just bad. They would only take a couple drink or food orders at once, not the order for the whole group, and we would have some people on their third drink while someone else was begging to get a first... it was just frustrating... At the end of the day I think you should try The Vig, it is a cool place worth spending some time in, but don't expect any type of perfection.",

However, for a great happy hour, drinking with friend taking advantage of Arizona weather this is  a great place.    The atmosphere is modern but a little laid back, but then again it would have to be if you have boccie ball!  The patio is were it is at, and I think there are more tables outside then inside.  There is also an additional bar in the back.    Food:  Overall the food is good, it is no blow your mind food but there are some strong items, I have had the following:  Apps: Salmon plate - I really liked this Crab and Artichoke dip - They use Crab with a C not with a K :) Dinner: Carne asada on a potato pancake - This is my fav dish here, bug fan of cotija cheese and gives the dish a great balance Achiote Salmon and Chorizo Arepa - very nice spice Steak Salad - I was actually a little disappointed with this dish, I think the salad dressing was great but the steak was overcooked and not enough cheese  I haven't tried the brunch but I am interested in what they offer.  I think that if you are looking for a chill outside bar with modern bar food the Vig is a fantastic choice.    The valet is a bit overkill - I can walk 10 feet to a front door, I think the valet comes into play because sometimes it is hard to get a parking spot, really is a bit unnecessary but then again I guess they are creating jobs.",

I started with the lemonade while everyone else had a beer, and my husband was happy to see the Dogfish 90 minute on the menu.   For dinner, I went with the greek salad with a side of sweet potato fries (of course!).  The greek salad was huge and came with some pita bread, so this was definitely a great choice for an entree.  The sweet potato fries were delicious, but I was not a fan of the yellow dipping sauce they came with.  What even was that?  No one could figure it out.  The boys loved their burgers and fries.  Definitely big portions!    Our service was so-so, but nobody seemed to mind.  It allowed us plenty of time to chat and just relax, which was nice.    I wish there were more choices like this in Chandler!  Until then, we'll definitely take the trek back to the Vig, especially when it gets cooler and we can take advantage of the patio.",

You see, they have these glass doors that they open up in the back of the restaurant when its nice out, and sometimes, when you go through those doors from the outside to take a trip to the loo, they close them on you, so like an asshole, you attempt to walk back outside the way you came, but instead you bash your head and knees into the glass window in front of 35 people. Be mindful of this.  But hey, at least they had the most amazing wine specials that night and I was saucy enough to laugh it off and take a bow.

    "text": "I had an earlier review of this place's performance at lunch which had a higher rating. Last night, however, took the cake. There was a horrible, really awful, stench out on the back deck of The Vig. It smelled like an entire family of rats had died underneath our table. It was the smell of death, or of a really dirty restaurant. It wasn't pleasant. Unfortunately, it started up as we were halfway into our meal.   I know that the patio of The Vig is a popular hangout, so I am actually baffled as to what's wrong with manager Pam and others in management who hear about this from customers and yet don't do anything? They say \"It's not our fault. It's the restaurant next door, with stinky dumpsters.\" As is True in the rest of your life, making excuses doesn't help. The only thing that would help is the complete elimination of the odor. Others were going inside the restaurant to eat. We stayed and finished our meal -- only later were we surprised no one had offered to move us inside as well. My guess is that if they had, about ten tables would have volunteered to move -- and they couldn't fit everyone inside if that was the case.   I wrote a note on my check hoping someone would take pity on us and offer a free drink or something for my next visit. But no . . . Not even a call to management the next day resolved this. \"Not our problem\" was the response.  Unbelievable.",

Otherwise I love the atmosphere and the seating.  The space is really good, outdoor seating during this time of the year is jam and ambience are spot on for a group or a more datish type situation.

That said, I've never had a bad night at a Vig (there are two locations now - so be specific when telling your friends where you are!)  It's a very cool atmosphere, but sort of hard to describe. I almost want to call it a classy neighborhood bar? I mean the look and feel of it is very classy, and you get the feeling you should dress a little nicer than just heading to a pub, but then they have games, like bocce ball, that make it feel like your neighborhood bar. Very cool.   I could see this being a great default spot for a young adult, professional crowd. Especially if you live nearby. Definitely check it out.",

    "text": "Okay for drinks, never eaten there.  I've only been there with my GF and her work buddies for drinks.   I agree with the earlier comments regarding the Vig as being a place for people to see and be seen.  It's in a peripheral neighborhood of Arcadia and seems to aspire to be the equivalent of a Scottsdale club.  It doesn't make it.  First, there's no need for valet parking.  This isn't the kind of neighborhood for it.  Take over the cheap Mexican place immediately to the north and let people park there.  Sorry, folks, this ain't Scottsdale.  A lot of people don't care to have valets park their vehicle in a midrange bar.  Had two drinks, honestly poured, a little pricey--but then, you're paying for a \"trendy\", Gen X and Y atmosphere.  Beer price was all right.  The trouble is that this place seems to be a dive which is trying to reinvent itself as a \"happening\" place.    I'm an Arizona native, and could immediately wonder why a bar would put upholstered furniture on the patio in the middle of summer.  Guess they don't mind replacing cushions yearly.    I'll repost after eating there; thus, this is an incomplete review.  However, if you like to see either older women on the make or the younger crowd showing off, cool.  But this place might do better as a neighborhood bar.",

    "text": "With a swanky 60s underground vibe, the Vig is one of my fav places to go for a night out. Although they are located on a pretty busy street, they did an excellent job with the design of the outdoor area. The cinder blocks that make up the walls, the trees that hang down over the outside tables and the dim lighting/candlelight totally set the mood. The inside bar, booth and table area can get super noisy, so my suggestion is to sit outside especially if it's nice out. I also looooooooooove that they have bochi ball!   Their drink, wine & beer lists are solid, and their menu has an interesting flair to it. The double down hummus is yummy, and I also recommend the deconstructed fish taco. I really enjoy their take on bar food. Like the potato gnocchi with sauteed shrimp for example... the orange-chipotle alfredo sauce is something that I would never think of, but it really compliments the potato gnocchi and the veggies that are also tossed into the dish. I was impressed.   I'm all about places that have character, and The Vig is a great addition to the Arcadia area. It's not one of those places filled with fake people just trying to impress each other. Instead, it's a fun hang out spot where you go to joke around with friends and have a good time, and what's not to like about that?  It can get overly crowded, and the service can be hit or miss. But overall I'm a fan of this place and it's become part of my Arcadia stomping grounds. Plus, they also play awesome music and I can totally get my groove on!",

Very heavy so share some apps or go family style...you'll be fine.  A glass of wine, please do, it's almost a must at this place.  Not the greatest wine selection, but it adds the allure to the feel I was talking about :)  Service, well it was there and they were on top of things.  There's a patio with a nice fire place - there used to be X-mas lights hanging from the trees and I don't recall seeing any this time - maybe a return with some friends and a bottle will refresh my memory :)  - enjoy!",

I'm used to the suburbs so driving here I thought we where going to go to some cheap restaurant. I was both surprised and excited to say the least. To me it seemed very hidden seeing as to how I am not from Phoenix. That being said when I opened the door I was pleasantly surprised at how great it looked inside compared to its surrounding. To start I had the ceviche appetizer ( good!) and the Pad Thai(great with chicken, shrimp was an option as well) My girlfriend contemplated between the Mac n Cheese and Carne Asada. She chose the Carne an liked it. Seemed a bit small to me, but definitely tastey. She liked it too.  All in all I give it a very good 4 stars and that's only because I didn't try a drink. The menu seemed a bit modern Mexican but as I said it did have a Thai Pad. Drink menu did seem tasty and diverse, but unfortunately I wasn't drinking.  Nice little gem!",

I think I maybe thought it was a tad overpriced and I'm not a fan of M-F happy hours that end at 6, but I'm willing to overlook that because the food is all AMAZING and the Sunday Specials make up for the Happy Hour thing.    The staff is great. I lost my phone there yesterday and felt really bad bugging the busy bartender to ask if one had been turned in, but he was super nice about it. My friend found it under an umbrella stand though. Thanks for asking, I know you were really concerned. Our waiter was also awesome and the manager helped us relocate after this random dude who reminded me of the guy from Mask (the Cher one, not the Jim Carrey one. That would have been awesome.) sat down at our amazing Bocce Ball table and WOULD NOT LEAVE. It was seriously ridiculous.  At least buy a round of drinks if you're going to bogard our table, Ginger!  But I digress.  The smoked salmon appetizer, the deconstructed fish tacos, and the Thai vings are my fav menu items. But I haven't had everything so that's not to say other items aren't equally amazing, because I'm sure they are.    Honestly guys, I think I'm still drunk from being there yesterday. Normally when that happens I hate everyone and everything, but I still love the Vig today.  5 EFFING STARS.",

The project is titled \"Spanxx, the Unenthusiastic Stripper\"...it will be beautifully illustrated, in delightful and fanciful watercolor's, designed to inspire the imagination:)  It's a children's book:)  The first of series, really, about \"Spanxx\", a delightful \"seasoned citizen\" and her misadventures trying to make a living in this economy:)  We took a collaborative meeting at The Vig last Saturday.  I know what you are going to say, after reading my earlier review, you are going to ask, \"Why would you go back to the Vig, Donald?\"  I would ask the same question...the answer,  is that one of the owners of The Vig sent me a note, apologized for the problem, assured me that what I experienced was not their policy, and asked me to give them another try...and he was so darned nice about it (and really, he was even nice about my review, which wasn't especially nice), that I couldn't say \"no\".  I took Carin (who had no firsthand knowledge of either The Vig, or my review, although she had heard that the place was very cool from some of her modeling and acting buddies).  We hit The Vig at what is likely the very best time to visit...early Saturday afternoon and got ourselves situated in one of the outdoor booths...a warm breeze was blowing and the martini's were flowing:)  It's a different atmosphere altogether on a weekend afternoon...no cigarettes, no raging hormones (or at least if they are raging, they are doing so quietly...much like \"Spanxx\":)  We ordered a hummus and baba ganoush appetizer, a Vig Cobb salad and the Pork Torta, as well as the aforementioned marti's and we spent a couple of hours having lunch and cocktails, discussing our project and laughing and discussing and laughing some more!  And it was really nice...I mean really very nice.  I asked Carin what she thought about The Vig, and she said \"this is wonderful...it should be our \"go to\" in Arcadia\"!  So I showed her what I had written, and she said, as all supportive spouses should \"You must have misunderstood\"...meaning me...meaning that I was likely, even probably, wrong:(  Well, I suppose I could have misunderstood...I may have misjudged...I am very busy solving very complex problems in my mind on a pretty much constant basis...and I had just been to my philosophy discussion night, so I was thinking about all that stuff...probably:)  Oh what the hell...I was charmed by the afternoon version of The Vig, and since Carin likes it, I know that we will be frequent visitors.   I'm OK with that...the food was good, the service was good, the atmosphere on a warm spring afternoon was delightful and it was splendid little spot to let the dishes and the glasses pile up.  It takes a big person to admit they made a mistake...and humility prevents me from pointing out that I am a giant among men for theoretically admitting that I might have erred in my previous assessment of The Vig.  A 2 star swing seems like a lot, but as I said in my earlier review, The Vig was at least A-OK, even at night...on a lazy Saturday afternoon, chatting, laughing, drinking and eating with the great love of my life, The Vig is easily a 4 star experience:)",

I think I had a bad taste in my mouth due to the fact that last time I was here the bar gave my credit card to someone else (that person then spent more at the Vig on my card, then more the next day elsewhere). People make mistakes, I get it... The manager offered me a free bartab next time I was in to make up for it. I went back 2 weeks later and he had been let go, or left, or something.... But forgive and forget! I love this location, due mostly to the fact that it is smaller and more intimate, and has an ACTUAL patio outside! The menu and specials are the same as the uptown Vig, you can't go wrong with most anything you order, but me, I'm partial to the burgers and wings!! The cocktail menu is very creative as well, which is always a bonus!",

However, the rain let up a little bit and we decided to take a chance at sitting on the patio.   The staff could not have been more accomodating, they set up the umbrellas so we wouldn't get wet if it started to sprinkle again, they encircled us with heatlamps, lit the fire and even passed out blankets!  I don't have much to say about the food, both times I've been here I've been too tipsy to really remember if it was good or not. But I highly recommend sitting on the wonderful patio and having a glass of wine.",

Two of my friends took me there. I loved the atmosphere and ambiance. The patio is simply enchanting.   My favorite is the vig rig that will take you home for free if you don't feel like putting up with their valet, don't feel like parking 8 blocks away because it's the closest you can get, or you are not sober enough to drive home. The ride is free and was gratefully appreciated when we were there with no car to get home.  What keeps me from upping the star level? ** Parking ** Non-memorable food ** Didn't impress me enough to make a note to come back",

    "text": "Mmm...came to The Vig last year when visiting a friend in Phoenix and had a fantastic lunch experience. Came again a few nights ago to experience the late night menu. We were in around 12:30am, and were promptly greeted with fantastic and quick service even though the place was pretty packed. We ordered the nachos with no meat and extra guac. They were EPIC. Some of the best nachos we've ever had. Full of toppings, crispy, warm, delicious, plentiful. Wow. Our friends ordered the artichoke dip (yum) and the edamame (good but damn pricy for an item that is usually less than $2 at most establishments). My SO ordered a margarita and it was alright - a little watery and the most prominent flavor was the margarita mix instead of tequila. Overall a fantastic joint with a great vibe - will definitely be returning. Looking forward to a round of bocce ball next time.",

    "text": "I am giving my seal of approval to The Vig for a few simple, straightforward reasons:  *$3.50 pints during Happy Hour *Decent selection of beer, including Stella and Pinstripe (mmm) *So-good-you-want-to-moan artichoke dip (which would be that much better if served with warm pita bread; not chips) *Cool decor with a spacious, modern outside patio *Friendly and attentive service *Beautiful and/or interesting people to watch *Fave candle and hand lotion in the ladies room *Attracts an array of patrons, like muscle-y tat guys, Euro intellects,  buxom beauties, network engineers and writers *Trivial Pursuit cards on each table - woohoo!  A few negatives to note: *5-spiced edamama was totally meh; will never order this again *Sweet potato fries were served with regular ketchup - bleh *Has a somewhat chaotic/disorganized feel, inside and out *Smoking is permitted on the outside patio *If you don't valet, you must part across the street *Could use a couple more beers on tap!  All in all, a very nice place to grab HH after a hard day's work.   During HH the apps are 1/2 off, which allows you to order a couple to share and sample. Between my friend and I, we each had 2 beers and shared 3 apps, totaling only $30. Not bad when you split the cost.   Plus, our server was a genuine and friendly gal, as was the stunning hostess who greeted us the moment we walked through the door.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to go to the Vig for ages.  i finally got to go on Friday, for a friend's birthday.  We ate elsewhere, then headed over to The Vig for drinks.  It's a beautiful place; atmosphere-wise it's got a great date ambiance.  It was close to 10 when we got there, so it was already pretty crowded, but we headed to the patio that was fairly empty due to the cold.    It's even more lovely outside.  We huddled around a heater, and I was really absurdly impressed when a waitress came around and offered us blankets.  Very soft, puffy, lovey blankets that I wanted to steal.   Our waitress was pretty rude, though, and had an \"I'm way too cool for you\" attitude.  I typically don't blame the establishment for that, unless it's ongoing and constant every time I go.   So since it's my first visit, I won't take a star away just yet.  I had been told they had a wicked chocolate martini, so I ordered that.  It was frankly pretty grody.  But that's just a matter of personal taste, and I just won't order it again.    The problem?  The crowd was soooo not my crowd.  It was all the shiny people from Scottsdale.  I really, really wanted to like it.  I still do.  I will give it a couple more tries, and I am curious how the food is.    For a night out drinking, final destination-type place?  I'm just not feeling it.  But I bet it's ideal for a lazy day of day-drinking on the patio, once we get our lovely early spring weather.",

That's right, Stella on tap, and yes, they have that too.  I've heard their whole menu is good, but since I cannot get past their Trifecta (sliders) or their Chicken Fingers, I cannot comment.  But man oh man are the sliders and fingers bomb.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something very relaxing about the Vig for me.  Maybe it's their trumpet player that's there on Tuesday and Wednesday nights who's playing is intoxicating by the way.  Or maybe it's knowing that I can drink until I can no longer see and George and the Vig Rig will make sure I get home safely free of charge, just a kick ass service that the Vig provides (tips always appreciated of course.)  The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star place for me is the simple fact that their cocktails are priced a bit higher than reasonable.  If I'm paying $8 for a Ketel soda, I expect it to be tall and poured with a heavy hand, which these I'm sad to report are not.  I will however continue being a faithful patron of the Vig for all the reasons listed above, and you should too.",

I love the oxidized steel and the sink in the women's bathroom...so great!   Anyways, I really had a great time here. My partner and I went with another couple who recommended the spot. We got a little table right next to the Bocce Ball court which was fantastic.  I had two long islands which were both perfect strength and exactly what I wanted after a long week. To eat I ordered a chicken salad (i can never remember the names of all these salads...they start to run together) and shared my partner's 1/2 and 1/2 (french fries and sweet potato fries...yum!). It was excellent. Not anything out of this world or new or anything like that...but still really good.   I was perpetually impressed by the music selection too. We walked in to some old school MJ and then ended up hearing Feist (and actually something besides 1, 2, 3, 4...), and Esthero. So I was happy.   I had a really great time here. The only bummer was that trash smell, but I just read in Jason's review that Filiberto's is to blame for that one. Sad. But they threw on some nag champa and covered that right up and we were good to go.  So all in all, head to the Vig, sit outside, have a drink, play bocce ball and have fun!",

Great Patio, Great Bar, Great Food, Great Laughs, but the one thing that was never great was the parking.  They have a valet, but it always seems to be full, so you started to park across the street, well that parking is now always full.  The Vig has been struck from the list of places that I frequent, because I hate to wait for a table at a neighborhood grill, and because I hate to park a half mile away for a chicken sandwich.  The Vings (get it...Vig WIngs...Vings) are very good to start off, and every single meal that I have enjoyed is excellent.  They have a rotating beer tap that is usually something delicious, and very enjoyable.  The cocktails are strong, but not too strong.  The patio is one of the best in town.  They did a great job of giving it character and limiting the view of the crap shopping center across the street.  This is another great Phoenix establishment in the likes of LGO, Chelsea's, The Parlour, etc, but the parking has turned me off to the point that I don't even think about it any more.  It's such a shame that a great establishment has to be ruined by those in Scottsdale and Tempe that make the drive to our neighborhood grills!!",

I live way up north and rarely venture out on Sundays so it was nice to see a place bustling like The Vig. I also found the crowd to be a refreshing change from what one might find up here roaming around City North and Desert Ridge.   I went with a big group of friends. We all enjoyed the scene on the patio, live music, fun people. Drinks were OK, not the strongest in the world, but that might not have been too bad since we were there for 7 hours.   Around 8, we finally got a table outside and had some dinner, which tasted great to me, but we had been drinking for several hours. I loved the Queso Fundido. My friend and I enjoyed it so much that we got a second round. By that time in the night, anything with melted cheese and chips sounded like heaven.  The rest of our friends got sliders, chicken sanwiches and the tandoori flatbread. All of those were well received. I think the flat bread went over the best.  The only thing that SUCKED was that someone stole my iPhone 3GS off the table as we were leaving. Next time I'll keep that at home.",

We were seated and waiting, waiting, waiting for service.  There were a fair amount of empty tables, and they didn't appear to be understaffed.    Finally some girls doing a promo for a vodka label came to our table and offered us free Moscow Mules to start the night.  So we accepted.  And while that was very nice, no waiter ever came to our table.  We had planned to eat at the Vig, but after 45 minutes we finally just left and went someplace else.    I will say that the parking lot valet was awesome.  He kept our car in one of the few spots right by the front door, so at least it was easy for us to get out of there and on to someplace better.",

Love the pork nachos, mac & cheese with steak tips, several great salads & the grilled cheese with sweet potato french fries. It's comfort food at it's best! Actually it's comfort food dressed up a little so you don't feel like an 8 year old ordering grilled cheese or mac & cheese.   And since it's important to feel adult when ordering kid food you have to have a cocktail at the vig. There is usually always a specialty cocktail on special ($5). And they usually have something fun to offer with a infused vodka or such. Cocktails are usually around $7.    Overall it's one of my favorite bars in the Arcadia area. Just a fun atmosphere and good food.",

It has the facade of an old Motor Inn Lodge, found somewhere deep in the Midwest, complimented by a spacious sun patio and a bocce court.  Yet it has the modern opulence you would expect in Arcadia.  When the Vig combines the two, you get dap cocktails and wine in the most comfortable and inviting surroundings.   In my opinion, the Vig is the best place in the Valley to day drink, especially on a lazy Sunday when you can sit up on the bar, feast on their Posole, drink Mechiladas (which they will make upon request), and venture out into the warm sun after working up a chill in their cavernous interior.  They also have half-price wine on Sundays.  I also must mention that their staff is probably the most friendly group of people out of any bar I've been in around the valley.",

We had the Mac and cheese and the wings and nachos and pozole everything was pretty good the Mac and cheese was a little soggy but still very cheesy. And the pozole had an American spin on it definitely not your abuelas pozole but still good. Would go back",

    "text": "Our first Vig experience was the one off Bethany Home. We had a riot there in the indoor patio playing beer-enhanced games of skill. This time we came for a game, went to the 40th street bar. We have been here twice. The Vig/Postino crowd is really great. The decor and lighting is really trendy and the bartender here was as attentive as they come. In our two times here, we have tried the Reuben, Burgers, Vings (I like the Asian style), and pear and chopped salads. I tried some of everyones. Its that good. The other thing that is really bad but great for soaking up alcohol is the cheesy tots. Not what you think,  so I will let you be surprised. Happy Hour is best hour, great drink deals and specials. It is always happening, no matter when we go, but the Arcadia site is big enough to hold em all. Never a bad time.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed this place for the second time. I recommend the Thai sweet and spicy wings. Has a great flavor and crispy but not dry. I always get my wings extra crispy just to take the slime away from the skin. They grill and fry the wings, which is so weird but awesome. The posole was amazing and you got so much it was well worth it. I highly highly highly recommend the posole. Filled with chucks of meat and great savory flavor in the broth. I will def be here on rainy days for that posole or any day i feel i NEED it which is EVERYDAY. The place is casual and nice for a dinner or lunch. The bartendars are awesome, as far as the service for the regular servers.. not so fond of their service. They are extremely slow and not very friendly. This place has become a new favorite and i cant WAIT to try the Mac n cheese!",

I actually had a tough time finding the front door (even pre drinks) because of the way everything is situated and hidden. Inside the waitstaff was fun and friendly, and there was definitely a crowd. The drink menu was great and includes a specialty Moscow Mule that is different every night of the week. I think ours was orange flavored- I sampled a friend's and it was delicious. The food was great for pretty typical bar food- I think I ordered half the menu. Bacon mac and cheese, nachos, sliders, etc. Overall it was a great place to meet up with friends and have some fun.",

    "text": "I am very disappointed and will never return to this location again! First of all the drink my friend ordered was an Arnold Palmer but they failed to tell her it is made with a tropical tea so it didn't taste like an Arnold Palmer. Secondly, my friend ordered the Vignature Rib Eye ($26) medium and when she got her plate it was brown all the way through. When we finally got another waiter to help us (our waitress was MIA) we told him and he took it back and sent the GM over to our table and when she addressed the problem with my friend she bent over and looked her straight in the face and said \"medium to our chef is prepared this.\" When my friend stated to her that is not how she wanted it the GM was very rude and argumentative that we just said take it off our ticket. We had already waited an hour for our food so we did not have time to wait longer since this was our lunch hour. Lastly, when we were about to leave the restaurant the GM was at the exit and my friend asked for a business card or something with the GM's name on it and she stated that's me in a very unprofessional snotty way and handed her a card like good luck with that! When she first came to our table regarding the steak we did not know she was the GM. I really feel like she treated us very rudely and unprofessional nor give two shits that we were unhappy with our food and service. What happened to serving your customer? Also, if that is how they prepare the Rib Eye the waitress should have stated medium is brown all the way through with no pink. I have eaten at this Vig on numerous occasions and was just here last week but after the way the General Manager treated us I WILL NEVER return here again!",

This Posole is rivaled only by my moms. And from what I'm told, the chef flys his mom in to perfect the recipe... Great for rainy days, hang overs or a good lunch.

My husband and I joined the group a little late, but we knew they were planning to be there awhile so we ordered food anyway. The service was extremely slow and unorganized. Our server was so random about taking orders, and I'm not even kidding you when I say that after I finally got my drink (Malibu & pineapple), I was not asked even one time if I wanted another (and we were there for 3 hours). My drink was empty for probably two and a half hours with not a single person checking on me. My husband was lucky enough to be asked once if he wanted another beer. And at the end of our visit, we had to tell the server what we ordered throughout the night. Didn't realize that was our job to keep track? So yeah, service was a one in my book. But the food - so good! I ordered the mac & cheese (don't judge!) and it was amazing! And only $5 - yay! My husband got the wings and he liked them a lot. The place was nice and all, but at nine the music started bumping and I'm just too old for that shit anymore. Overall it was fine. We had a lot of fun, despite bad service. I'd go back with a group, but probably would never recommend or suggest it to anyone.",

It had no taste to it at all and I swear the spinach had been previously frozen.  I guess when you order something labeled healthy you don't always get a lot of taste so I could have lived with that but geez...  When I pay $10 - 12 bucks for something that probably cost them $.75 to make, couldn't they at least throw a little garnish on the plate?  The omelette looked so lonely there all bare naked.  Hey, maybe a little fresh fruit or toast or SOMETHING?  Sprig of parsley perhaps? I ordered a side of toast to split with my friend and well - it wasn't toast because it wasn't toasted long enough and the bread looked (and tasted) like something I'd get at the dollar store. This was my first visit to the Vig (either one) so maybe the person doing the cooking was just having a bit of a rough start to his or her day.  Don't think I'll be back though.",

Though I have been to Postino and I do like it there quite a bit (see my other review).  The first time I went to this place was in mid-summer.  It was on 4th of July weekend and it wasn't too crowded, we sat outside under a mister which somewhat cooled the dreadful heat.  I had a good time, it wasn't crowded, the design is cool. The second time was this past weekend, probably the busiest time of the year, Thankgiving weekend.  The place was SUPER packed.  We got a table, right next to the door, which meant every time it opened or was held open I was freezing.  It just seemed like your typical go there to be seen type of thing.  I was wearing my clothes from the day, tee shirt, and jeans.  All the other girls there were wearing skimpy cocktail dresses!  The atmosphere that the architecture portrays is more laid pack and hang out, but the clientele gives me the feeling of snotty and rude. I've never eaten here and I've only seen someone else eat the grilled cheese.  I didn't think it looked too great, there was like an inch thick piece of bread on either side of 3 half melted pieces of cheddar.  The fries were very skinny and looked pretty good...of course I'll eat anything that may involve ketchup so I'm not sure that says much and I didn't actually try them. If I lived in Phoenix I most likely wouldn't be frequenting this place unless maybe it was an off night and I could just hang out in a sweatshirt.",

The food is wonderful and inventive, the beer selection is a who's who of micro brew and the patio is a great place to spend an afternooon day drinking!  It tends to get a little over crowded on the weekend nights so I usually stick to Sat. & Sun. afternoons.  Again a great place to chill with friends, drink great beer and enjoy the weather.  Happy hour here is always popular and the grilled wings cant beat!",

I love the Smoked Salmon. If you like Bocce Ball, the Vig has it. The atmosphere is laid-back and the ambiance is nice. The Vig is always playing a great selection of music from different eras. The weekend DJ is always smiling and having a good time. He manufactures great sound.",

Worthwhile to visit if ever in Phoenix.  2 thumbs up!",

    "text": "I've actually been here twice now. First time, I was with friends after a tasting at Sportsman's. The only thing I remember is that I wasn't very taken with the atmosphere, and not too impressed with the food. But, I keep hearing friends with positive comment, so I thought I'd try again. This time, I stopped to grab a quick dinner before a late business meeting nearby. No parking spaces on the lot, so I used the valet since I was in a hurry - and he parked it on the front lot in an unmarked space. WTF? I could have done that myself for free! I was there with menu in hand by 10 of 6. Happy hour ends at 6, and the woman bartender, who was not very friendly, took her good ole time getting orders for two other couples that came in after me, so I wound up with no wine discount. She shrugged. Younger guy bartender was happy to answer questions about the food. Achiote salmon was much better than I expected, even though the slab of fish was obviously of the perfectly-formed, vacuum-packed, frozen variety, not even close to fresh. The somewhat sweet corn cake, set off with spicy chorizo in the center was the highlight of the meal.  On a Tues. night, a few cougars, but mostly regular gals at the tables eating dinner...and a lot of Creepy Old Guys (COGs). Too many other great places in the area to return to one that is just so-so.",

Here are a few simple notes to sum up the evening.  Waitress was on something. She was walking, but out of it. Forgot our order twice, and both times could not remember even taking them. Very bizarre.  Girl next table fell over and out of her chair. No one really even seemed to notice, maybe that happens often here now.  Place looks tired, worn out, especially the fabric on the chairs and booths outside. If you squint, you can see the old Vig, when it seemed spotless, and shiny. Now a bit tattered, along with the staff.   If you are over 28, then I would have to say you might feel old in here. Reminds me of a spring break crowd being filmed by an MTV crew in Cabo. Very young, very drunk.",

    "text": "Well the layout sells this place all by itself. Very comfortable spot and it's easy to stay for hours. However, one of the contributors to being able to stay for hours, is because of how slow the service is. Took about ten minutes to be greeted and another 10-15 for first round of drinks. I had the Swisskey Nickel Sandwich (on ciabatta instead of pumpernickel [which was cool the server made sure I knew it wasn't a big deal]) Not too shabby. Couldn't taste any horseradish in the mayo...and the cranberry chutney, is more like a preserve...but good flavor overall and sweet pot fries were pretty spot on...didn't care the dipping sauce. Their Arizona Stronghold \"Mangus\" is not as Big as I expected...for the price, and for where it's listed on the menu. SO in a nutshell...great layout to hang with some friends or fam and chat it up (A+). Service is splotchy (C+) (never even knew my servers name) and the food is good (B).   OH!!! I do owe the server some Kudos for hooking it up with the discount we had asked about a little earlier than he was supposed to.",

Here's the breakdown: - Seasonal Veggie Plate: 4.5 Stars, so good!! - Tandoori Flatbread: 5 Stars, loved it - Chips, Salsa & Guac: 3 Stars, not bad, nothing special - Hummus Plate: 4 Stars, very good hummus - Vigan Sandwich: 3 Stars, fine but probably wouldn't order it again  The Vig has slowly worked its way into my list of default places to go, especially late night.  It doesn't hurt that they have lots of vegan and veg options!",

The food was delicious but the staff was so awful. When I first arrived I felt that the waitress was unwelcoming and very short. She took forever to just bring water. As I waited for my drink to arrive I noticed she was short with everyone. Then I realized she was the only waitress working with two busboys. I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea  to have only one waitress working on a Friday night when it was packed. The waitress was clearly stressed and was unable to conduct herself in a professional manner. I noticed before the when the table next to me could even thank the waitress for the check she turned her back and walked away. I also saw another party walk up to the bar to grab menus and order drinks. We were not given silverware and we're not asked how the meal was. Don't come to this restaurant, especially during the weekend.",

Hot chick sandwich, best turkey, mahi-mahi sandwich, nachos, soup - all are excellent. I did not review this place until I'd eaten here a few times, because I wanted to see if they could deliver top notch quality consistently. They exceeded my expectations, which is why they deserve a 5 star rating.   Happy hour ( 3-6 pm) has 1/2 price appetizers, $2 off wine and other drink specials. They also have Odell's IPA on tap, which means they are serious about good beer.  Parking sucks but so does every other place in that area. Really nice atmosphere - good lighting and great patio, but can get really crowded at night, so come early.",

Apparently The management thinks the Vig is a dance club now.  The music is so loud, even outside, that it is  annoying. I came to meet a potential client who wanted to \"try the Vig\" and we will not be able to hear each other.  I was at Z Tejas yesterday and asked about the music and they were able to turn it down just a little which was enough. And yes I am an old guy who does not hear so well anymore. Be that as it may I still do not understand why a restaurant where you go to meet people and talk needs to  have concert level music going.",

But for some reason I just love The Vig (this one, in particular) and put up with it. Happily!  Their food and drink menu fits everyone's needs. You want a cheap beer and nachos/burger? Done for only $13. You want some nice wine & tasty/unique salad? Not a problem. Loads of wines for under $10/glass (half price bottles all day every Sun) paired with the Prickly Pear Shrimp Salad total for $20. Who's complaining? Or go rogue with entrees like Carne Asada on Potato Pancake or Pad Thai. I've gone to The Vig with the pickiest and the fanciest eaters. All left happy. I just don't think there are too many places I can say the same about.   Birthdays, Engagement, No-good-reason.... All shared with The Vig. It's truly a top 5 go-to spot for me. Quirks and all. I honestly just love it.",

    "text": "While I can appreciate the appeal of having a disinterested, gay, hipster server who is probably really good at bullshitting about wine, I found the overall ambiance and service sort of off putting.    The boyfriend and I waited a good ten minutes before someone came over to take our drink order though I noticed the server eying our table long before then.  I imagine he thought perhaps we were NOT, in fact, disinterested, gay hipsters who could bullshit about wine but rather low-end Mesa kids tired of slumming it at the local dive so we thought we'd treat ourselves to someplace awful nice like The Vig.  Except, The Vig is only \"meh.\"  The burger is worth it for five bucks on Monday, the fries are awesome, the drink specials are mediocre, the atmosphere I found a bit stuffy and unfriendly, the menu is all over the place with no solid direction or theme and the \"totally modern, contempo art deco\" bullshit bathrooms make me roll my eyes while I pee.  I got a couple vodka sodas and they were lacking in the \"alcohol\" department which is sort of the only reason I order them.  They were also served in some stupid, pretentious glass.   Overall, the experience seemed dark (maybe cause there were no windows) and sort of awkward and I found myself wanting to leave pretty quickly.    I can appreciate some hip little lounges where people go out to be seen and maybe pretend that the food is amazing; but The Vig is like the douche bag dude you see driving a BMW with his top down even though it's 6 a.m. and 20 degrees outside.  I assume his account is overdrawn and his girlfriend says she's an artist but really she's a server at Oregano's.  I think what it is though, and I realized this as I scoffed at the sparkling silver, super modern sink fixtures in the woman's bathroom (with a door cleverly labeled with a giant \"W\" for women? get it? \"W\" is for women), that mostly I'm just a stiff drinks-cheap-food-sticky floors-tore-up-waitresses dive bar girl at heart.",

Love the Mondays, when burgers are $5. Love Sunday Funday's at The Vig. Get there before your Saturday night hangover starts really making you feel hung and get your 'hair of the dog' sangria, mimosa or bloody mary on the patio while you enjoy the up tempo of live music. The bar is happening too for watching games and cool, friendly bartenders. Sundays are cheaper wine by the bottle days too. Pet the cat that hangs on the patio. He's not annoying. He likes to say hi and hopes that you will drop a snack for him. Bocce ball on the patio. I find the wine a little less pricey at Postino, if your comparing a watermelon to a grape. But this is still my fav, all around go-to place. Valet is pretty much the only way here. Now The Vig has even comandeered the parking lot across the way for $ too on valet. Not to keen on that idea. But not enough to make me rate them any less or keep me away. LOVE the firepit outside in the winter.",

Loved the massive tree in the center of the \"courtyard\", I'm sure it's even better in the evening when the lights are on. There was a pretty good crowd for an early Saturday afternoon. May have had something to do with the beautiful weather.....Or the delicious alcohol being consumed on their glorious patio. ;)   Nothing to complain or rave about when it comes to the service. She was friendly and we never waited too long for our food or drinks. Gotta like that. Something quirky that was purty cool, they have trivia cards on the tables. This made a fun light drinking brunch into an afternoon of debauchery. Those days are the best, cheers to the vig!  Oh and i guess we ate stuff too. So on to that part....My friend had The Best Turkey sandwich that she said was pretty good, nothing out of the ordinary. And I had the Arcadia Burger that was DELICIOUS and on a pretzel bun? Winning!   Parking is small but not too shabby oh and side note... its dangerously close to OHSO. :)  I will return to The Vig, but next time I'm going for the bloody Mary bar instead of the Blue Moon!",

    "text": "Late Thursday lunch at the Vig for about 20 people out at the patio, we all left with a satisfied smile.  Vig has a rather larger patio than I expected, it gives you a very cozy feel with the big tree in the middle, the fireplace and the couches nearby. The inside seating seem to be quite dark as I just walked by. The first glance of its menu is somewhat random, to my opinion, I wasn't sure what is what, but then I was all confused on what I should get, one page yet with so many varieties, can someone please help me?   Well, in our little group of 6, we shared the hummus plate and the homemade potato chips, both were very good, especially those chips, very thinly cut and complimented very well by the spicy chipotle ranch sauce.  I had the market fish plate, which was a kind of Hawaiian white fish (Oahu fish?), simply grilled, served on top of some corn polenta, grilled fennel and cherry tomatoes.  The overall vinaigrette over the dish was a bit on the sour side for me, but with the light taste of the fish, it actually balanced it out well. I really enjoyed the dish. Some other dishes on the table included the Pad Thai, fish tacos, black bean burger and the smoked salmon salad. I had to point out the Pad Thai especially, which came in a huge bowl, while it tasted pretty good, I was so convinced its a bowl for two, so if you aren't super hungry, order it to share.   And of course our side of the able had to have some dessert to complete the meal, we all shared the walnut brownie with ice cream. I usually think it's pretty hard to make a bad brownie if you can read instructions, and this one was just perfect for us. You should see how happy when we left.  **One thing to note, although its Thursday at 2pm with only a few tables, parking was quite limited, some of us had to park at the plaza across the street, I cannot imagine if it was a busy time...",

Plus on the weekends, you'll most likely enjoy live music as well!   First of all, I love that they have freshly squeezed cocktails, including a delicious greyhound with fresh squeezed grapefruit! Their food here is delicious as well and I especially love their sandwiches and sweet potato fries. On a healthy day, I opt for the deconstructed fish taco which is fish and all the toppings that you can pick and choose to eat from.   All in all, the reviews speak for themselves.

    "text": "BACKGROUND   The Vig has four locations: Arcadia, Fillmore, McCormick Ranch, Uptown  This was my first visit to The Vig Arcadia.   I had to meet a friend for lunch and he chose The Vig. I had heard a lot of great things about The Vig Arcadia, so I had high hopes.  Although the atmosphere is super cute and intimate, it borders on too closet-y tiny when the restaurant starts filling up.   SERVICE EXPERIENCE   I got there early, so I sat at the bar and decided to check my phone. My battery was very low, so I asked the bartender to point out the closest outlet, or I suggested she could take my phone, so she could charge it behind the bar.   Unfortunately, the self-proclaimed \"staff manager\" was rude and positional beyond belief, which are literally the only 2 qualities a server doesn't need to have.  Me: \"Hi! I'm m waiting for a friend for lunch, do you mind plugging my phone and I'll have a greyhound.\"  - We don't have outlets.   Me: \"Well, that isn't exactly the True, because everything in this bar is using electricity, including the blender you just used, so what you're really saying is that you can help me, you just don't want to. I find it shocking that an upscale restaurant in Scottsdale doesn't have outlets.\"  - This is Arcadia, not Scottsdale.   At that point, as she was completely rambling about the difference between Scottsdale and Arcadia, as well as the status of the electrical systems and a fierce desire to convince me that an upscale establishment doesn't have outlets.   \"Obviously, there are outlets in restaurant. Clearly, you just don't WANT to plug in my phone.\"  I asked to speak to the manager, which apparently they didn't have one of those either or she wasn't allowing me access to him.   I did still had hope that she might serve me that greyhound.   Anyway, my friend arrived and we moved from the bar to a table.   Then, the second part seems almost like were at another bar altogether.   A new waitress cheerily gave us waters, told us the specials, said she would give us a minute, and was gone.   She came back a minute later and took our order. All the appetizers arrived in minutes.   The food was delicious. The server was a delight.  THE MENU  Appetizers Artichoke Kale Jalapeno Dip (which I had) Steamed Edamame (which I had) Guacamole & Chips (which I had) Flatbreads Nachos Hot Wings  Salads Sandwiches  Burgers  Mains: Vanilla Braised Short Rib Tacos (which I had) Fish Tacos Man n Cheese Grilled Salmon Pad Thai  Desserts  CONCLUSION   I have to say the the vanilla braised short rib tacos are some of the best food I ever put in my mouth.   It's a shame to see an owner and the chef putting so much effort into making the restaurant a success, lose an extreme amount of business just because of one argumentative server who can leave such a lasting impression on customers.   4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *There is limited parking out front.  Valet service is available.   *Hours: Sat/Sun 10am - 2am Mon - Thur 11am - 2am  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthevig.us&s=5aa7f760f727a430c8ddb193f3055899a6d7d35655679ff90a6bdfad39eeab8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thevig.us</a>",

The staff is great starting from the valet to the wait staff.    The food is pretty good but not 5 star quality.  I had the fish tacos, which were good, some in our group had the bloody marys but they had to doctor them up themselves.  Again I can not complement the wait staff who were always right there.   I was the designated driver and my tea glass was kept full, which is not always easy.    I love the decor of the restaurant.  It has both indoor and outdoor dining.  We started out, but it was a little windy, so we moved inside.  But otherwise the outdoor dining would have been nice.",

This last time I got the fish tacos (4 to an order on double corn tortillas), and they were good but not anything amazing. I didn't care for the spicy slaw and rather it had just cabbage personally. Our waitress was super friendly too. She checked in on us a couple of times. I came here with a friend I hadn't seen in years, and the waitress was patient with us and our orders as we took a few long minutes to catch up first.   The atmosphere of the place is fun. It has a fairly decent patio section and apparently it includes a smoking section. There is cornhole, which is plus. Overall, a safe spot to go for some good food but I wouldn't say you'll be surprised.",

We drove over 2 hours from Sadona so we didn't have to order off the late night menu.  We sat down at the bar at 9:52pm. Bartender came over at 9:58pm with late night menu saying that it's past 10.

You can choose from burgers, sandwiches, entree salads, and main courses such as fish tacos or short ribs.  The ingredients used are fresh and the food is well-prepared. We come here and eat really well but still are very healthy, OR we come here and splurge on calories and dive into chili tornitos (queso, chorizo, and bacon), piled high burgers with onion rings, and mason jar dessert (mud pie, strawberry shortcake, or banana cream pie). Many menu items are labeled gluten free or can be made gluten free upon request. They have a great kids menu as well.  We really love the vibe of The Vig. It's laid back and casual but not so much so that it becomes a hole in the wall. Just a chill and mellow place for friends to enjoy some great food.",

The outdoor space is awesome and the house it's situated in is like a cape cod house in downtown. I just live the building. We had drinks... Me a Moscow Mule, him a beer and hen a Martini. We had guacamole and chips, and wings and then he had a hamburger and fries and I had a large bowl of that goodness...the pasole was on point. Of course it was way too much, so I took it home and had it a day later and it was even better then.",

My friends ordered a Croquet Monsieur, biscuits and gravy, and chips n guac.  We all agreed that the food was satiating and not too heavy. We were energized and our plates were empty by the end, as opposed to leaving leftovers or feeling too full after.  The atmosphere was great, the food was at a great ratio, and we enjoyed the live music in the patio Saturday morning. Would visit again!",

The staff new me and my coworkers and we're so friendly and always took the best care of us, which is why we continued to come back, and would always tip well over the 20%.  The waitress we had was attentive and kept our drinks full, however the rest of the staff didn't care to even acknowledge us. When my burger was dropped I said, \"could I please get a side of ranch if it's not too much trouble.\". After about 10 minutes, peaked inside to see the guy who dropped off our food just chatting with a server at the terminal. Another guy was bussing the table behind us, had just started gathering plates, when I asked again, \"hey would you mind grabbing me a side of ranch\". He told me \"your server will be around in a minute or two.\" As a server myself, I would assume a guest's request would be more important, or take whatever is in your hands in and possibly grab that side for me. Not trying to be a burden, just would like to enjoy my fries while they are hot.  Our server came by, and promptly grabbed a side for my friend and I, pretty much saving the day.  I then ordered a burger to go, asked for it on a leaf. Got home, and it was on a bun. It was for my mom, She can't have gluten. She can't even eat it. Super Disappointed.  Probably won't be coming back in unless Paul, Junior, Ricky or Ryan are there.",

This is not atypical, this is what I experience every time. The only thing, and I do mean only... Is a very nice patio. They don't have very good drinks, they don't have very good food, and the beer isn't even cold. TAC onto that the prices are not favorable. Let me just go check Yelp... Yup there's about 50 other places within half a mile. Later Vig.",

I've been hearing about their $5 burger and fries special on Mondays so I made a dinner date with my girls and headed on over. Surprisingly we didn't have to wait for a table, even though their patio is the place to be it was a little too hot for all of that.   My girls and I decided to go for the burgers of course! I ordered the Vigazz burger which came with arugula, Gouda cheese, bacon, sauteed onions and some sort of sauce on a pretzel bun. And since I'm obsessed with sweet potato fries I decided go for those instead of regular fries. I wasn't prepared for this gigantic burger and fries that was placed in front of me! It all looked AHmazing...and it tasted good too. I could only eat half of the burger and fries but took the rest home to have for lunch the next day.   The service was so-so nothing bad but not spectacular...our server seemed a bit uncomfortable or nervous...maybe he's new??   Anyway very good deal for 5 bucks, I may have to make this my Monday night spot since I live so close :-)",

When it's too loud to speak at the same table without yelling, well then the whole room has to yell to be heard. They did turn it down on request and the whole room went down a notch or two.   The food, cocktails and service were top notch for a small place such as this. It's popular so try to get there before prime time. Valet parking takes care of that issue as the place fills up.  We shared the Mac and Cheese, plain, as an appetizer and it was truly tasty. They offer add-ins like broccoli and bacon if that's your thing.   I had the Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake ($15) and it was truthfully the most satisfying meal I have had in years. The beef was well seasoned, pink in the center and pre-sliced. Delicious. This was accompanied by a potato pancake covered with guacamole, sour cream, cotija cheese crumbles and a very well matched garlic tomato sauce. If you have one entree to introduce yourself to their menu, this is the one.  The manager stopped by to say Hi after the server shared my delight with this dish. She thanked us and explained that when the chef left for the other location, they insisted this dish stay here with the restaurant. And a good thing too.  Go here! Eat! Enjoy!",

But being in the business for nearly 20 years, every law enforcement officer I have encountered has encouraged against it stating and I quote \"impressions mean everything.\" Why would a business with nearly 200 seats in the dining room allow a minor to sit at one of the few seats at the bar and disrupt the adult atmosphere the bar is created for. I guess the Vig would rather sell a $3 Shirley Temple with free refills rather than a $10 Craft Cocktail they have taken so much effort to create with no free refills or a $16 glass of wine to adults wanting to have an adult experience. Check out the pictures attached. Either this minor sneaked sips from his father's drink or the water he was drinking made him sleepy. Either way, not my scene. I prefer to sit next to other adults my own age, not their kids. Shame on the parent and the Vig for allowing this.",

The reason for the 3 star rating is the service. I don't know if the Mothers Day brunch sucked the life out of everyone by the time I went (around 5) but my waitress (by the name of Kennedy) was the most unfriendly waitress I've ever had. Not one smile, very short, and in general appeared to be very uninterested in her job. Worst part is I was going for my birthday celebration with a friend. I would gladly go back, but perhaps to a different location where I won't risk being served by Kennedy. At first O thought she may have just had a gripe with my table for some reason, but I observed her with her other tables and her attitude was very much the same.   Bottom line: Disappointing service, but excellent food and atmosphere.",

The outside patio blends seamlessly with the interior space when the doors are open. I had the turkey sandwich and my coworker had the fish tacos and we both loved our food. The Brussels sprout sides are a must try. The customer service was excellent and we were checked on by multiple people during our visit. My only negatives are that the inside is very dark. I could see that being an issue for some people. Also, the beer selection was just Meh. There was only one local beer on tap, Kilt Lifter, and I really enjoy trying new craft beer when I'm traveling. This seems like the kind of cool place that would offer that. Get there during happy hour for discount food and drinks, and to avoid a long line at the mandatory \"complimentary\" valet parking.",

My girlfriend and I visited on Tuesday night and practically had the place to ourselves which is nice because every other time I have been here, it's been packed! So keep that in mind. The service was awesome, and the food was even better! I would recommend the bacon mac and cheese.  Music selections were awesome as well!  Can't wait to come back!",

I couldnt decide... my friend said the Carne Asada was SUUUUUPER good. Sooooo, that's what I got and let me TELL YOU... it was BOMB.   Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake: sliced carne asada on a potato pancake with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, cotija cheese and roasted tomato sauce  For people familiar with the LA area.... this place has the same look, feel and vibe of Beechwood in Venice.   Go here!! Its YUM!!",

We have been here for both brunch and dinner and both menus were outstanding. The last time we visited I ordered the turkey sandwich and an iced coffee with vodka. Both were amazing! I couldn't put the sandwich down and was slightly afraid of how delicious the iced coffee was. It had just the right amount of vodka to get you going but wasn't overpowering. The outside dining area has the perfect amount of sun and shade for a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. We will most definitely be returning.",

I love the neighborhood cats that hang outside, the occasional live music, the outdoor fireplace and last but not least, their Mac n Cheese is the greatest thing on the face of the earth!!!

You can either go to the free valet (just tip them when you leave) or park across the street.  If you have an extra couple buck I'd suggest the valet.  Quick, easy and frankly it makes me feel \"special\".  Happy hour is stellar and everything I've had there is great.  Burgers, wings, salmon.  Great beer selection and even better patio.  If you read my reviews you will quickly notice a theme of 4 things...  1. Love bars 2. Love patios 3. Love food 4. Love my wife  This place satisfies all.  They have bocci ball to boot.  Grab a cocktail, put on some shades and loung in one of their comfy chairs.  Oh - staff is always on point from the bartenders to the bus boys.  Oh - (another one, sorry) I heard the owner opend a bar called Little Woodys down the street.  Haven't been but if its the same guy I'm sure its a nice spot.",

They play great covers (Johnny Cash, Tom Petty, Gin Blossoms), and throw in some originals every now and then. The music is also at the perfect volume, so you don't end up having to shout to have a conversation. The patio is the place to be, but it gets super packed. We ended up just hanging out by the outside bar because it was going to be an hour wait for a table outside.  But the crowd... at the very least it makes it for good people watching. It's pretty much D-Bag city. Last weekend, a guy had a huge Cadillac tattoo on his arm rocking some type of Affliction looking shirt. Enough said.",

The self proclaimed Modern Tavern has a nice mid century modern feel on the inside and a terrific patio, replete with an outdoor bar, fireplace, and bocce court.   Today was the day of the local annual marathon here in Phoenix.  For residents that means one thing - forget about trying to go anywhere by car.  So Jen, Ethan and I hopped on our bikes and met up with some friends for lunch at The Vig.   Arguably one of the best items offered here, isn't on the menu: their pork pozole soup, aka pozole rojo.  I guess after frequenting there enough you start to learn about the hidden menu - kind of like \"animal style\" at In-N-Out I suppose.  The red chiles used in cooking it impart an intense brick red coloring.  Well I'm in a pozole rut right now.  Every time we head there I just have to order a cup or bowl.  With the required warm flour tortilla the bowl is a meal in itself.  The chef at the Vig really nailed this dish.  It is a perfect blend of chiles, slow roasted pork, hominy, oregano, garlic and cilantro.  It has the right amount of kick to.  It is so good, that it is one of those dishes that I am just too afraid to try and make at home - because you know it just won't be the same.  So for now when I am in the mood for pozole I'll hop on my bike and ride over to The Vig.",

    "text": "We ate dinner here New Year's Eve with a small group and I was excited after hearing such good things. It was around 7pm but we didn't have to wait for a booth at all which made me happy! Our waitress came out and was a bit quiet and somber, maybe she wasn't happy about working that night I don't know. I liked the inside of the place, I'm not sure if they usually keep it that dark there or if it was just for the occasion, I didn't mind at all but I know some people like normal lighting at least to read their menu. They had a bunch of balloons hanging everywhere which I thought was cute.  We started with the chicken nacho appetizer to share and it wasn't my favorite. The chicken wasn't bite size, more like two inch shredded strips and some ends were very tough. The tortilla chips were super salty and thin so the ones under any toppings got soggy fast. The flavor of the whole thing was nice overall but needs some work in the details.  I ordered the turkey sandwich with sweet potato fries and I was just a tiny bit sad I couldn't get a side of the mac and cheese for an upcharge! My boyfriend got the carne asada dish that also sounded tasty.  Throughout the night we had maybe three or four men and women come to the table bringing food, drinks, refills, etc. Our actual waitress I think came three times total. I don't like this style of dining especially when the waiter or waitress doesn't even try to make an effort of being friendly or happy to serve you. Some of the gentleman bringing refills were smiling at us more than she was, and they weren't even getting tipped. This is where they lost a star from me.   But, it would have been 5 stars because the food was awesome. My sandwich was probably the best I've ever had. The pretzel roll was soft and slightly chewy, the cranberry chutney bursting with flavor, and the coleslaw was tangy and really brought the whole thing together. The turkey was good but hard to mess up as long as it's not taken out of a plastic grocery package. I don't remember what type of cheese was used but it was also great. I had to take half of it home and even cold the next day as leftovers it was still delicious.   The sweet potato fries were pretty good as well, hard to care about with such a great sandwich. I tried my boyfriend's carne asada dish and I liked it, there was too much tomato in my opinion and it gave it a steak and spaghetti type of flavor.  After dinner we ventured outside to take a peak at the patio. I loved everything about it, and the cat sleeping quietly on a couch cushion under the heat lamp even with all the party commotion going on was such a sweet sight. I would love to come back in the Spring maybe near sunset and have some cocktails outside.",

    "text": "Went on a weeknight and it wasn't too crowded, but perfect for getting drinks after school/work.  Had a glass of wine called kung fu girl, nachos, and mac n' cheese. The mac n cheese was sinfully delicious.. seriously, it was so creamy and rich, I felt my waistline expanding, but it was too good that I couldn't stop myself.  It was a little too creamy and salty for my liking, but that's because I like to eat a little on the light side.  The nachos were to die for- the pulled pork was a surprisingly good combination with the regular nacho toppings- definitely didn't see that one coming!  I'm waiting for a good occasion to try this place again; nice little romantic date spot I'd say ;)",

I guess I was jst looking for a place to kick back and relax and I found hat hard to do with the older crowd and all the men in suite's. Maybe I'll try this place on a friday or saturday next time. This was posted on yelp events I didn't see many people taking pictures of the place and didn't feel that I should take a lot of pictures in there last night. I think I took one, and I didn't get a chance to play bouchey ball. bummer.",

    "text": "This place is awesome. I really REALLY love everything about it. It's got a cool, kinda trendy but mellow vibe.  The low lit bar/indoor dining area is very stylish and definitely reminds you of  something in L.A or Scottsdale.  The outdoor dining area is AWESOME-nicely lit and VERY cozy feeling. And though there were people dining outside, it was a little too warm in my opinion. Like I said, this place has a Scottsdale feel complete with all the beauitful people. Definitely more upscale clientele, but it's very casual. I was able to sneak away just as well-dressed cougar was starting to stalk me. I had a burger which was really good. The menu is a little limited, but there is a good selection of appetizers, salads sandwiches as well as some steak, chicken and pasta entrees. Everything is reasonably priced as are the drinks. This place is not cheap, but the quality of the food and drinks make for  good value in my opinion. The prices definitely do not reflect the atmosphere, as you'd certainly expect more expensive drinks and food when you first walk in and see the place. All that  being said, the parking situation SUCKS and it's in a slightly dodgy area (there's a cheap Mexican drive-thru on one side of it, and residences on the other side. Across the street (where you have to park if you don't want to do valet) is a drive thru liquor store and a check-chasing place. You have to park north of the check-cashing place if you don't want to be towed.   But DON'T let any of this deter you from checking this place out. It's one of my favorite places in Phoenix and I'm so glad I checked it out. This is one of those places to bring out of town friends and family-it will impress the hell out of them (once they get past the neighborhood)",

We sat outside on a chilly night and enjoyed the KICKASS patio with a little heat from the propane heater next to our table. fantastic ambiance and the best part was the dj mixing some hip hop while another dude played a trumpet and guitar during certain parts. what a classy touch! we all loved it so much! the beverages were good and the service was as well. i can't believe i'd never been here before but i am a fan i will be returning!",

The breakfast in manhattan martini doesn't play around, it has woodford reserve bourbon shaken with fresh apple juice and syrup! It has shredded bacon lining the rim of this intoxicating drink. The only reason I gave them a 4 is because I ordered my steak Med-Rare and it came out Medium and even more dry than a medium should be.",

Sat at a booth and waited 10 minutes but no waitresses.  Went to the bar and couldn't get a drink, not that busy.  Went outside to back bar and they were completely nonresponsive.  If you want to be seen or are looking for a late night meat market then go.  Otherwise, stick to when the service exists earlier in the day.",

Reminded my of a Chelsea's/Postino type of place and had the same clientle. The only proble was the food. I had the \"hot chick\" with onion rings. For a $12 sandwich, it lacked chicken, flavor and came with soggy bread and soggy onion rings. How hard is it to make onion rings? thinking of them almost makes me sick. However, i would go back, possibly for drinks and appetizers. Who knows, maybe they were just off that day. I guess i just had higher expectations. And why the need for Valet here? it seems crazy.",

The bar was full, all the indoor seating was full, even in the summer most of the patio was taken. Patio was large with lots of great outdoor seating. It turned out to be worth the wait. The ceviche and the grouper were really yummy but I would avoid the duck salad. The service was mediocre but the waitress was very busy with tons of full tables. It was a fun, hip, and trendy place although it was really loud and crowded. Not the place to go if you want a quiet dinner with no scene.",
