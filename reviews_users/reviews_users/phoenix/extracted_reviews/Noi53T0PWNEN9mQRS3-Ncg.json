So big & good (homemade hummus, broccoli, tomatoes, carrots, etc.).  SUPER friendly & fast service, both inside and drive thru.  Love the decor/colors, vibe.  Espresso could be better, it was a little bitter.  I want to try everything on the menu.  It all sounds so great.",

But immediately after my first bite of the California club, I know that it is the best club sandwich that I've ever had! It's a perfect combination of avocado, bacon, tomato, and most importantly, the sour cream: it made my day great! With respect to the decor and space, I would say that it is pretty cozy and relaxed, but the space is limited. I would definitely go and try other stuff.",

The atmosphere is really laid back and the service is always great. I am a creature of habit but may I recommend the veggie breakfast burrito? Oh. My. God. It's divine. It's balanced and filling-and I feel like I'm starting my day off right. The iced coffees are so yummy, but beware of knowing what size to order... I went for the large Americano once and got a thirstbuster of espresso!   The only drawback of both locations is the parking lot, especially this one. It's quite small and hard to navigate.   Overall, I highly recommend checking this place out if you're looking for a place with healthy breakfast and lunch options & great coffee. There's something to satisfy both vegetarians and meat eaters alike!",

    "text": "My fiance and I needed a quick place to stop for lunch on our way between Sedona and Los Angeles.  We were driving through Phoenix, and we settled on D'lish because it was a well-reviewed drive-thru with plenty of options.  It was a good choice, quick, affordable, and tasty.  There was a short line for the drive-thru, but we were helped relatively quickly.  I was expecting a McDonald's-style drive-thru speaker system, but an employee came out and took our order while we waited in our cars.  The same employee then took our money at the pay window and maybe even gave us our food at the food window?  Is that too Looney Tunes?  Maybe there was another employee or just the one window.  Either way, he was a nice guy.  I ordered the combo lunch with a sandwich, a side, and a small drink.  I chose the turkey club, which was a pretty decent sandwich with smoked turkey, bacon, cheese, avocado, tomato, and lite honey mustard spread, served on toasted whole wheat.  It was a decently sized sandwich, not heavy but filling.  It was maybe a little dry despite having good turkey - less bread, maybe, or more mayonnaise would have done the trick.  I picked a soup for my side, a red pepper bisque that came with bagel chips.  This was excellent.  The soup was soothing and thick with tomato and red pepper, and the crispy bagel chips were perfect for dipping.  I'd definitely recommend a soup if you're coming through D'lish.  For my drink, I subbed in the Breakfast Buzz for a little bit extra.  I wasn't quite sold when I read the description on the menu, but as I often do, I let the voice of Yelp dictate my order.  This drink was a shake made with vitamins, protein, espresso, nonfat milk, peanut butter, banana, and chocolate, blended with ice.  Pro tip, guys - don't lead with vitamins and proteins.  It makes your drink sound less delicious.  I'm glad I got the Breakfast Buzz against my fat-craving inner skeptic - it was fantastic, creamy and refreshing with plenty of banana, peanut butter, and chocolate to silence the healthier components.  We ate our lunch in the car and drove off in less than fifteen minutes.  It was a nice, efficient stop, and the food was well worth stopping for.  I'd recommend to D'lish to Phoenicians and weary travelers alike.",

They use flavorful, quality, natural ingredients yet still manage to crank out tasty food very quickly.  Hopefully you don't need to eat in your car, but if you do D'lish is the ticket.  -- Traditional breakfast burrito, $4.75/$6.25 w/ meat: Score!  I have had a lot of breakfast burritos and this ranks up there as one of the best, if not the best, ever.  The chicken sausage was a total winner and the cheese was out of this world.  You might think $6.25 is a little pricey for a breakfast burrito but the ingredients are sooo good that it is totally worth it.  -- House blend smoothie, $4-5: This smoothie ranks up there with anyone else's.  A must get if you want to kick start your day with some blended fruit rather than caffeine.",

Both were really good but it was too much to take on at one sitting. The drink was next level good. It is coffee, peanut butter, banana, milk, vitamins and ice. I could've gotten this one on its own and been perfectly content. The sandwich was really good as well. I'd get it minus cream cheese next time. The bread on the sandwich was phenomenal. Overall, I'll definitely go back. I'm pretty sure the Scottsdale location has been a few different places over the years but I'm pretty sure this place will stick. It was super crowded around 11:15 and for a healthy, quick, made from scratch drive thru it ticked all the boxes..",

Not only has the quality of their food gone down but also their ability to hire individuals to provide any form of customer service. Today I called in an order and like many other times I get a girl who answers the phone like she would chatting with a friend, zero phone etiquette and the vocabulary of a child. In addition to the drop in service and the quality of food, the owners still have invested no money into the dump of a building this place is in. I'm surprised it passes the health code inspections. There is no bathroom for guests to use and it seems as if they are in no hurry at all to have these issues addressed.",

Don't go expecting the speed of fast food drive-through.  You will wait a bit but it's worth it because the food is that much better.

I kept trying to give this place a chance, but each time I would witness this guy be so rude to guests and then myself. First example, 2 girls sitting at the coffee bar talking about the night before, not being loud or obnoxious just being girls... This guy yells at them bc he hears them say a bad word and says \"where do you guys think you are?! This isn't a bar! You need to leave if you're gonna keep talking like that.\" Next example... A group of us went in there for breakfast one Saturday morning and my friend Kevin was kicked out bc this guy heard him swear... My third and last visit there... My friend and I were waiting for our drinks (this place is tiny and not much standing room) I'm telling her about my other 2 visits here and point out the guy to her... Sure enough he yells at us and says \"you girls need to get out of my way!\" I'm like \"there is no where else to stand\" he rolled his eyes and just walked off in a hurry. I get that cursing is inappropriate, but both of these times people were talking amongst their friends, not being loud or obnoxious. And to be honest, in both cases I never even heard the cuss word used, all I heard was this dude scolding people. The only person that's loud and obnoxious there is him. Like, I just wanna get a cup of coffee, not be scolded for saying \"dammit\" or for trying to find standing room in this shoebox",

I don't care how you prepare it, mix it, twist it, shout it...it grosses me out so bad. people who like/love/don't mind mayo always say things to me like 'try this potato salad, you can't even taste the mayo' and you know what? they are always lying.   anyway, i ordered the turkey club and asked them to hold the honey mustard spread. thankfully there wasn't any mayo so i didn't have to ask them to hold that either. this sandwich has a ton of my faves: tomato, turkey, bacon, cheese, avocado. scrumptious ingredients.   as soon as it's in my car, i can smell mayonaise. i think to myself 'oh, you're crazy, it's your immagination- the description said nothing about mayo'   well i am crazy, but my nose was right. mayo. on. my. sandwich.   usually i wouldn't flip out but my large sexy dirty chai and sandwich cost me $15. the drink alone was worth the $4 something dollars for several reasons, but the sandwich was gross and totally over priced. the bacon was pretty bad, and i ended up taking off most of the ingredients bc it wasn't very good. i was able to wipe off most of the mayo from the turkey and avocado so i ate that.  i was just so, so sad.   the customer service is great, the sexy dirty chai is great but the food i will not eat again.",

Yes, I understand ordering vegan is a bit more complicated but at a place like this, one would think that the *entire* staff should be competent enough to be able to handle such a feat.  After speaking with a manager regarding my last order and telling them I did not want a free meal, that I just wanted my money back and it was the principle and the concept of when a food establishment gets an order wrong, it creates waste. I was surprised to hear their reply: that they don't care what I do with the food. Be that as it may, they should care because that means they're losing money. So, after I stated I just wanted my money back, the manager seemed to have become short and frustrated. This last visit just further solidified my validation in that this place is NOT for vegans.",

More often then I'm in and out before most cars have even placed an order.  Update on my initial complaint   Can't fathom how they can't get their signature drink consistent each time. It's like the employees just guess. Really disappointed that the Buzz I was looking forward to this morning was over powered by the amount of espresso poured into my drink. It can't be that hard to post the recipe by size right in front of the blender fir the employees to follow.",

This place is always a good idea for hangover cures and for breakfast to go. It's so good I might even get it today for breakfast or lunch!",

I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.  When I ordered, the server suggested a \"Sexy Dirty Chai\", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a True local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)",

I work close by and have always struggled with my local occupational coffee situation. Ya see... I love to put my money in locally owned and operated businesses, but the cafe at my work location serves horrible coffee so I have been wearing a disguise and hitting the Starbucks drive through to make it through some work days. until today.... D'lish has marvelous fair trade locally roasted espresso that is prepared to the coffee connoisseurs delight.   For lunch I had the hummus plate with chicken and the creamy tomato basil soup. The hummus plate was just OK (reason why the 5th star wasn't added to this review). The hummus was a little bland and the chicken was soggy as if it had been precooked and thawed. However, I really like how they serve veggies with their hummus plate and not just pita. The creamy tomato basil soup, on the other hand, was superb or shall i say D'lish.   The atmosphere is relaxing, cozy and unique with a bit of urban flair. I'll have to bring my laptop next time and relish the ambiance while I get some work done.  I'm so excited that I found good quality locally roasted coffee... I will definitely be back and I'm looking forward to giving a try to the rest of the menu.",

I didn't do the drive through ( I wanted to take a look at the muffins, doctor up my coffee the way I wanted it, etc.). You know, I though it was a nice little coffee place. The muffin was pretty good (although certainly not fresh from the oven...but then what is these days?). The coffee was also pretty good (they didn't have a dark roast option, so \"house\" was it for me...I would prefer a little better selection from a place where the primary business is \"coffee\"). They had to scramble around to get me some milk for my coffee, but scramble they did, and they came up with a carton after a couple minutes of digging in the refrigerator. The prices are reasonable, and that's always a plus. I will try them again.",

It's not too sweet (a la starbucks) It's not too expensive (a la coffee bean and tea leaf) It is my perfect drink.   I stop by on my way to work (granted there is enough time and the line is not atrocious). It is manditory I go Saturday and Sunday mornings. I like to bring my dog - and he is always given a treat.    Because of D'Lish, my dog always expects to get a treat no matter where I take him in the car.  I go to the atm and he expects the machine to cough up a dog biscuit, I swear.    The coffee shop used to be called Daily Rush.  Many of the same faces are still around.  Rarely do I have to tell them what I want.  It's always the same: Mocha Breve 16 oz.  A couple times - they've seen me waiting a car or two back in the drive-thru line - my coffee is ready before I even pull up to the first window.   Yup, they get me.  For lunch - I love their soups in the fall, winter, and breezy spring.   Their tomato soup is perfect coupled with the grilled cheese.  I do recommend drinks only -  if you are doing drive through. If you require food - their is usually ample parking.  It takes some time.  A True testament to this place: It is one of the drawbacks of going on vacation.  I can never find coffee I like in other cities.  Daily Rush.. I mean, D'Lish is as good as it gets, in my opinion.  Cringing at the thought of ever-present starbucks.. vacation mornings make me long for home.  If you are in south scottsdale - I recommend stopping by.",

It was from one guy's laptop; so you know he's got a great library of tunes. Thumbs up for me.   If you haven't gone here, go. Even if it's for a coffee. You may find, though, that when you arrive, you can't resist their menu options.",

    "text": "Last Sunday, the man and I headed out to get breakfast, enjoy some coffee and have a lazy read of the day's paper.  He wanted to take to me to the place he stops at many mornings on his way to work, but alas, it wasn't open until 11am.  (Side note: A coffee shop that doesn't open til 11am?  On a Sunday?  Really?)  We looked at each with blank faces.  Where to go now?  We needed breakfast, coffee, wireless internet and a place where we could relax without feeling like we were preventing a server from turning the table.    So I said, \"What about that little shack place further south on Scottsdale Rd.? You know the one that says coffee, breakfast, lunch on the sign outside.\"  He said something along the lines of, \"You're a f*$@ing genius.\"  His colleague had apparently been recommending this place for weeks and he hadn't tried it yet.  D'lish as it turned out to be called, was exactly what we were looking for.   As we walked up to the front door, we passed a lovely but small patio.  I was instantly charmed.  All along the patio are planters with homegrown tomatoes, herbs and other yummy garden delights.    When we walked in we checked out the menu and waited our turn.  Not sure who helped us but I'm assuming the two guys who we spoke with during our visit are Chad and Kyle.  The bf and I ordered the same thing: two breakfast croissants and two lattes.  The latte was great and satisfied the Sunday morning coffee craving.   The breakfast croissant?  Just delicious.  A fried egg, bacon and tomato with a light layer of pesto on the croissant.  Seriously delicious.  I don't know if I ever would have thought of pesto on an egg sandwich but I'm so glad that D'lish has broadened my culinary horizons.    The bf was equally satisfied with his meal, but did remark that he thought $6 was a bit expensive for a breakfast sandwich.  I think we paid a reasonable price for a quality product.  It is apparent to me that with a limited menu stocked with fresh ingredients, a garden on the patio and their status as a CSA drop off point, D'lish is trying to churn out food that is as fresh, natural, local and organic as possible.  Yay for them.    Chad and Kyle were nothing but friendly and welcoming.   A number of regulars came through while we were there and it was obvious they have quite a loyal following.  D'lish is small, no more than 20 or 30 could fit in the place.  However, they also have a drive thru to serve customers on the run.  We'll be back and hope to be regulars soon!",

This morning I woke up and needed some strong coffee, so I went to Dlish. I got the Veggie Burrito... AWESOME! Completely cured my hang over, soaked up all the alcohol! And The red eye completely woke me up! I am going to go back there for breakfast as much as possible. I am little disappointed in their lunch menu. It is lacking in vegetarian options( I am not a fan of egg salad sandwhichs and I am sick of the hummus craze!). I just noticed on there website they will be doing dinner soon- SO excited.   I wish there were more little precious places like this in Scottsdale!",

Trash cans over flowing with trash, trash all over the floor and under stuff, all the way into the Kitchen. It was terrible. I had the veggie wrap. It was OK. nothing special. My kids had turkey and chicken sandwiches which were ok. My wife had quinoa thingy which is just veggies and quinoa in a soup. It was good but clearly a pre made soup most. I am not sure I would go to this location again due to it being FILTHY! I don't care if they were slammed for lunch and in the weeds they should have cleaned up. They were all standing around not cleaning a damn thing. Not sure if I would give them a second chance...Coffee was mediocre at best",

    "text": "D'Liteful (*ducks tomato*)!  The small but mighty breakfast and lunch drive thru (formally known as D'Lish) has been a faint curiosity for me since I first drove past what looked like a line of about 10 cars eager to get their fix at this place.  I can't say with any credibility whether that is a normal crowd.  But having seen similar lines for drive thru's like In & Out Burger and Dutch Bros Coffee, I figured there'd had to be something behind the long lines.  So around 7:30am on a Sunday it was off to D'Lite's flagship location in South Scottsdale for breakfast.  Surprisingly upon my arrival there were only a pair of cars in front of me.  Additionally I saw that there was the option to park and dine in rather than go the drive thru route.  So dine in I did.  The space is fairly small with seating for maybe 20 inside and another 10 outside.  Parking is also limited with space for maybe 6-8 cars so depending on your arrival time dining in may simply not be practical, but the drive thru line was moving at a pretty decent clip regardless.  For dining in just order at the register, pick a seat inside or out and the good stuff is brought right out to you.  As this was my first go around here, I had done a little bit of research in advance and saw two particular items that were helpfully highlighted as \"signature\" items on the menu.  Seems like a good place to start.  So for my drink, I went with their Breakfast Buzz shake.  A 24 oz mix of nonfat milk, peanut butter, banana, chocolate syrup, espresso, whey protein, and other vitamins all blended together with ice.  To be clear, I'm not a coffee drinker so the espresso aspect gave me a little trepidation, but honestly I didn't pick up any real coffee texture with this drink.  The two most dominant flavors were the chocolate and peanut butter.  The shake basically tasted like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup in liquid form (which is just fine by me).  For my breakfast dish, I also went \"signature\" and chose their California Club sandwich.  Egg, bacon, turkey, tomato, avocado, pepper jack cheese, cream cheese & pesto on toasted artisan bread.  Pretty decent sandwich and a just right portion, though I'll admit the tomato flavor might've been a little too dominant here.  Would've preferred a little more emphasis on the turkey and bacon and I didn't pick up hardly any of the pesto or cream cheese flavoring.  That said I liked the portion of avocado and the egg was also emphasized just the right amount.  Total cost for the shake and the sandwich including tax came to $15.  Both items came out within 2 minutes and it seemed like the D'Lite staff paid just as much attention to their dine in customers as their drive thru ones so both dining options are equally viable.  In addition to their flagship spot in South Scottsdale, they also have a location in North Scottsdale and in Tempe.  Overall I was pretty satisfied with my first breakfast outing here.  It wasn't perfect, but it was enjoyable, affordable, and efficient.  I would certainly come back for breakfast and will likely try their lunch menu at some point (rumor has it their house style protein burgers are popular).  D'Lite yourself in d'licious d'lectable goodness.  Sorry, I'll see myself out now.",

Oh, and the interior seat cushions are a bit worn (being nitpicky now).  The food is delish (or d'lish, I suppose?), healthy, and somewhat creative.  Definitely NOT your typical drive-thru fair.  I've tried a few different things (wraps, cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches) and I always keep coming back to the California Club (no bacon please!) for breakfast and lunch.  It's impressive they are able to offer many organic and.or local ingredients for similar pricing to say, Subway.  Depending on who is at the checkout, the service isn't always with a smile, but at least it's pretty quick.  And for a sandwich this good, I'm totally fine with that!",

It had tomatoes, avocado, cucumber, cucumber sauce, and lettuce in a sort-of-pita-sort-of-focaccia wrap. The lettuce was not dressed and was the bulk of the sandwich. It would have been a lot tastier had the ingredients been mixed together prior to entering the wrap. I didn't expect it to be cheap, but $7 for this seemed a little on the pricey side considering it was just a wrap with no drink or side. Overall, it was a refreshing alternative to your typical drive-thru meal. I can't wait to go back and try something else!",

Imagine my shock opening this puppy to have it explode all over my car when pulling out of their drive thru.

I doubt anywhere else compares, and I wouldn't even risk finding out, because that means I'll miss out on either an AZ Burro or a Breakfast Buzz.  Healthy Drive-Thru?  Impossible!  D'Lish made it happen, and they are quick.  Even if there's a line, there will be someone taking orders so that the visit is as quick as possible.  I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes.  There's a large menu, and I'm sure it's all wonderful, but the AZ Burro and Breakfast Buzz are FANTASTIC.  It starts the day off right.  Do not order both in one sitting...    Parking is tough if you want to go inside.  That may be the one caveat if I were to think of one.",

I haven't been able to delve into their whole menu quite yet but I will tell you that their shake like drink called the Breakfast Buzz is probably one of the best shake combo drinks I've ever had.   The Breakfast Buzz has vitamins, protein, espresso, nonfat milk, peanut butter, banana, chocolate, and it's blended with ice.  My roommate goes there about five times a week, so if that doesn't say something, I'm not sure what does. I've heard nothing but great things about the staff and food from this place.   Just a warning, the drive-thru line can become incredibly long which shows how yummy and popular it is, however, it can be a bummer when you only want a Buzz. SOOOOO my roommate and I usually call and order it ahead of time so by the time we get there all we have to do is run in and pay, no waiting.   It's about a five minute drive from my house which is wonderful, but the Breakfast Buzz is so good, I usually finished a large by the time I get home. It's a problem, I wish I could make it last longer but it's just so freakin' good.   This place is a great option if you're looking for something healthy and delicious whilst out and about.",

I couldn't possibly explain in words how great I think this place is, but I will surely try.    The first time I ever went here was on New Year's Day and my friends and I still had on our Happy New Years dresses, heels, makeup, the whole 9-yards AND to top it off...we were sporting the hats that boasted HAPPY NEW YEAR all sparkly and obnoxious on it that we had somehow acquired the night before.  We were, needless to say, a bit hungover and ready for some delicious food after an incredible night.  The owners happened to be working that day and immediately jumped on board with us and joined us in shouting happy new year and then proceeded to explain the menu and take their time with us since we were clearly in no state to comprehend much of anything.  Needless to say, I fell in love with not only the owners but also the California Club (which we order on a croissant and add a hashbrown patty to).  This sandwich is like heaven, but better because it exists and is edible.  Seriously, if you're reading this, just stop and head over there for a California Club right now.  It'll be the best thing you have ever done with your life.  Ever since that day, I make special trips to this place (considering I live nearly an hour from it) and have never once been disappointed with the service or anything else.  This place can do no wrong and I just hope more people get the chance to try it because this is one place that should never go out of business.",

Lots of flies, dingy, very loud rock music playing inside(probably to drown out all the heavy traffic noise outside) We got a breakfast club and a lunch club sandwich. The egg sandwich had lots of mayo on it, which we thought odd. We had to leave before we were finished due to the bugs. About an hour after we got home, we both had upset stomachs. If you're a fan of loud dingy places with lots of flies served up on the side, this is for you.",

    "text": "I have eaten here four times. That proved to be four times too many. I tried, oh I tried, to find something appealing about this place. Beyond the very friendly staff, nothing else is making me want to come back. On my first venture, I ordered a breakfast burrito. Folks, you have to cook the egg. A runny egg, so runny I think the whites were still runny, in a breakfast burrito, is a breeding ground for disease. I mean, cook the friggin' egg. The next time I went I ordered a breakfast sandwich. It was served on a bialy. They forgot to include flavor - any flavor. I started to chew on the wax paper to add some spice. I kept blaming myself, I mean I read these reviews and I wonder what is wrong with me. I only wonder that for a brief moment. Janice B says she is in NY and can't stop thinking about D'Lish. WHAT??? Are you iactually living in the city or are you trapped on the top floor of Bellevue? There is nothing, absolutely nothing in Phoenix or anywhere else that compares to anything in NYC. One moment in NYC makes you forget the rest of the world exists. I digress, anyway, my third visit was the veggie burrito. Nothing I like better than raw mushrooms stuffed in a burrito. Why did I go back for a fourth visit? I did, I ordered a mushroom soup. I thought they would have to cook the mushrooms in the soup? Who knows, it tasted like water. Dear D'Lish, the way you make mushroom soup is very simple. Start with some shallots, saute them in a stock pot, you can add onions and garlic if you wish. Next add a whole mess of mushrooms, you can just use white ones, or mix them up, cremini, portabella, oyster, just saute them until all the water is removed, then add stock and cook for about 20 minutes - blend soup to a creamy texture, finish with some milk or cream and you have soup. Salt and pepper to taste. So simple, and yet you just couldn't do it. I can't come back, sorry, four times is way too many attempts, but good luck, it appears many people do enjoy your flavorless, poorly cooked options.",

There's probably a small percentage of people who know what they want before looking at a menu. So give me one first, then ask later...anyway not a big deal.",

I thought of D'lish because I remember the fresh and healthy menu that I loved when I first discovered it.  Fried, greasy, or heavy food was just not acceptable to me that day.  Sad that I was not able to share that same fresh experience with my friends this time with the food here.  My boyfriend ordered a breakfast burrito and it looked horrible inside once he bit into it. The eggs were green, way overcooked, and didn't really look like eggs.  Just looked like a light green meat patty.  Not sure what happened.  I won't say that I won't come back here ever again, but I hope they'll get back to serving more fresh and high quality food.",

And also, because they understand that tuna sandwiches are delicious both cold and hot, I am now giving a hard pass on any tuna sandwich unless it's from D'lite. I eat fish, but can't stomach much else in the meat department and their southwestern bowl (without chicken) is a solid choice as well. I'm truly \"living my best life\" when I'm eating their tuna salad (good for those who are also a big dill like myself ) Thank you D'lite, what a great start to my culinary adventures this year",

I have been here a few times now and the only reason for the loss of star is that their parking spot has potential to be a nightmare during busy times.   I have had their hummus plate and kombucha on previous trips and both were wonderful! The hummus is much more flavorful than I have had at other places and the veggies on the wrap and the plate have always tasted fresh and crisp. My dude loves their chicken salad and swears by it AND was totally jealous I went for lunch without him.   I am definitely enticed to frequent here more regularly knowing their effort toward sustainable practices seem legit, my lunch was given in a paper wrap without a plastic bag and I dig that! They say their produce is organic or locally sourced when available which is super stellar as far as I'm concerned.  I haven't yet tried their breakfast burritos or any of the bowls but it certainly gives me something to look forward to.",

They have an excellent menu to cover a wide variety of tastes and nutritional needs which is well priced and a good value to boot. Service was super polite and friendly which I always appreciate. But they went above and beyond on my first visit...they noticed I was traveling with my flat nosed beast (boxer dog) and hooked her up with a doggie bag of meat snacks after they asked me what she likes. The only knock on this place would be that the drive thru fills up and spills out onto Scottsdale road.  As a result, navigating the tight parking juxtaposed with the drive thru line takes some patience and a little skill, but the food quality and value combined with the awesome & friendly service easily outweigh any minor negatives. Just wish they had a location closer to where I live.",

A hash brown, two over-easy egg, atop a bed of greens all drizzled in pesto.  A pairing I wouldn't have thought to make on my own, but works wonderfully together!  Their pesto is not too thick, and tasted really fresh (maybe house-made?)  It was the perfect lunch for me, and I probably could've been satisfied with just one egg.  The california club sandwich was also noteworthy and full of flavor.  I could eat this for lunch, and maybe even dinner!  Man salad was huge - served in a gigantic bowl and included toasted bread.  There were a few parking spots, and a drive-thru.  Coming at an odd hour had plenty of seating, but not sure if this is True to the rush hours.  If you don't know where you're going - be sure to look out for it as you're driving by... It's easy to miss.",

Fresh Dill really made the sandwich pop And made it a totally different take on good old tuna. I can't wait for my next one. Good job guys!

I even ordered soup when it was 105 degrees just because i wanted to try everything!  And I don't mind paying extra cuz it's always fresh, delicious and they're friendly (and cute) so why not.  You probably drive by it all the time and don't even notice it, but you're missing out.

The other reason this isn't a 5star rating is also because they can take a long time.  Most of the time it's fine because they are making it from scratch but sometimes it goes over average and when that happens you would think it would be better than the last time but they aren't the most consistent.

I am quite picky and not an easy mind changer, but I'd like to go back tomorrow to get the exact same thing.  I wish this existed closer to where I live (Colorado).

I was surprised to have not heard of it sooner, as it was nearly within walking distance.  I perused their menu on their website, had a game plan then headed in. The seating area is small but not cramped, and is tastefully modern and cozy. The two other girls seated inside with me were both wearing Tori Burch flats, so I knew it was a little more highbrow than your standard hipster hangout. I ordered a vegetarian breakfast burrito, and brought back a classic breakfast burrito for my friend. They were quite tasty- very fresh and not greasy. I also had the \"sexy dirty chai\" I read so much about (a chai tea with coffee and vanilla) and it lived up to all expectations. I'm craving one right now, as a matter of fact.  Since then, I've also tried their yogurt parfait with fresh seasonal fruit and it was amazing as well. Their bagels are soft and delicious, and I'm looking forward to trying a Bialy sandwich next. Everything I've tried has been of good quality and freshness. I have yet to be disappointed with the food or the friendly service.  My only issue is that I don't think they quite have their \"flow\" down yet. Both visits took considerably longer than they should have for a small to-go order. It was much faster to phone in my order and pick up at the drive through window, rather than order and wait inside. Plus, when I used the drive through, I didn't even have to put on pants to go get breakfast. Does it get much better than that?",

They are doing some remodeling and in general making this place even better. They are adding some sort of juice bar component soon, which is great.   One dude knew who I was by my Yelp review, which was cool & a little scary.  He had a great take on Yelp though, and has the right attitude that a lot of the feedback can be constructive.  One guy working there wasn't a Yelp fan, which was fine with me, he gave perfect service and made me feel totally welcome.  I respect his point of view. We all don't have to like the same things...right.  They know my stance on pillows there, and I would love it if they would stay open longer on weekends. I will bring my own Baileys....Please!!!!!  Seriously great place.",

They're hand drawn and painted, which separates itself from the Starbucks mass-produced art work.   I loved the fact they used Pandora as their music source. Lots of great collection from indie musicians.   I ordered the 12oz Mocha which was very delightful to the palette. It was smooth and refreshing, it didn't have that burn taste. It was just great! Their menu is VERY healthy.  The owners are very welcoming and great to talk to. I like how they interact with the customers which give it that personal connection. I'm definitely going back to this place it's just a GREAT place to hang!!  This place has potential. They are expanding their menu so watch for goodies within the next couple of months. They buy a lot of their produce from local farms which help sustain the community - I'm a big fan of that!!",

I sampled the \"Breakfast Buzz,\" which is a delicious smoothie made with espresso, Nestle good morning mix, banana, chocolate, and peanut butter. The owner claims the Breakfast Buzz has restorative properties for those suffering from hangovers.  The coffee was also excellent. I'm 99% sure D'lish sources its beans from Echo Espresso on the west side.   Bonus: you can buy 160 ounces of coffee (in a disposable insulated box) for 20 bucks. That might be enough to get your group through a PowerPoint presentation or two.",

The drive through is so busy, at times the line goes out to the street.  (Scottsdale Rd)  3.  Because the inside is small, it can be very noisey when they are making smoothies.  4.  They do not have a location in Gilbert.  :o)   None of these are deal breakers, that is why I still give this place a 5 star review.

    "text": "This restaurant reminds me of being in Portland for some odd reason. The restaurant is pretty small, but the good thing is they have a drive-thru.  Breakfast selections were straight to the point. I had their Low-Carb breakfast that I ordered with a side of chicken sausage. I have no idea why this place calls this breakfast \"low-carb\" because it comes with a hash brown. I think a piece of wheat toast would have lower carbs than a baked hash brown. I would probably rename this  \"Low-Carb\" breakfast to \"breakfast salad\" because all it was just a salad with a hash brown and egg on top. It was served on a bed of greens with tomatoes on the side. The dish had balsamic vinaigrette on the bottom of the greens, and pesto sauce drizzled on the top.  I didn't like how my eggs were over hard.  In fairness, this dish had a nice presentation.   If I were to remake this dish, I would probably have the eggs poached, skip the hash brown, and add turkey bacon crumbles. The chicken sausage was nothing special. It was one sausage sliced up covered in cheese that became hard. They should probably grate the cheese over the sausage so it melts delicately on the sausage.   My brother-in-law had the breakfast \"traditional burrito\".  He was not to happy with it and thought it could use more cheese and flavor.  This is definitely a quasi healthy spot.",

It's nice that they made drive-thru an option - a much healthier alternative to your typical fast food joints.  Food: 1) Turkey club 2) Veggie d'lite 3) Dirty chai (chai with a shot of espresso) - tried it hot & cold. Both were good but the iced was a little better 4) Protein shake 5) AZ Burro 7) Veggie Burrito 7) Breakfast buzz  All the drinks and food were so delicious and cheap considering how healthy it is!

Not a huge menu, but big enough and with enough variety to make my selection take a little time. The girl was very patient with me. A guy at the breakfast bar suggested the California Club. It's their signature breakfast sandwich. I went with that and a iced coffee. This is a really good sandwich. Artisan bread and all the ingredients are really fresh. Oh and the iced coffee was really good and strong. I really like this place and will come back.

Together they are perfect :) I could just eat a whole plate of just hummus and pita. I wish I could of just ordered a plate of hummus and pita without the vegetables. (Maybe I can...will need to ask next time)  Early Bird Burger: Was surprised it wasn't made out of meat, and instead some other super good stuff. It was really good, and the bun was very soft. I thought it was a little too spicy for me, and the burger fell apart easily, so I ended up eating it with a fork.   For two people, this filled us up. I would go back again, and maybe this time I'll try the southwest bowl!",

The sandwich (around $8) was well made... the eggs were cooked differently, really thin somehow?  The pesto and mayo.. everything was great.  They cut it in half and wrap it up nicely for on the go eating.  Great service.  Great sandwiches.",

It is packed with smoked turkey, avocado, egg whites, potato, tomato, and feta in a sundried tomato wrap. It is huge, super filling and only $7! I promise that you will not be disappointed! It is great for any time of the day, not just breakfast! Another one of my favorite things about D'lish is that they have \"doggie bags\" for $1.50 which includes leftover natural turkey and basmati rice...the pooches LOVE it!!!!! And for $1.50, it is a lot of food! The line is sometimes very long, but don't get discouraged, it is worth the wait! You're welcome!! ;)",

Both were delicious, but the CC was the stand out! This place lost points on atmosphere. The parking lot was super tiny and with the drive thru, it made it difficult to get in and out. The inside was tiny and super loud so we ate outside. However the street traffic was almost as noisy since it's on busy Scottsdale Road. I will be back, but next time I'll just go through the drive thru.",

Once I first tried the food menu I was insanely hooked. I now have a goal of trying every single thing on it and I'm about half way complete. It's a great place to swing by for breakfast to not only jump start your day with some protein, but to jump start your day with fun. One time a robot took my order!!  Lunch is just as nice. The staff is great while you are there and really appreciate their customers (and they even tell you).  My favorite breakfast has to be the croissant sandwich (with no tomato) and for lunch I've ended up getting the chicken panini more than anything else.   If I'm craving a hot drink it's always a chai latte and for cold it's an arnold palmer with black tea.  If you haven't been here yet, you should go out of your way to swing by!",

I have been to D'Lish three times, and have had horrible experiences with service, and having to wait 10-15 minutes for \"fast food\".  I understand that quality food takes time to make, but they need some serious help! I am beginning to think that the owners are stubborn and don't want to pay for more help.  I was also overcharged for my food on every occaison, and was so frustrated with the cashier, and the pressure of the long line of people waiting to order that I just said \"screw it\".  Based on food alone, I would give this place 4 stars.  But the bad service brings my rating down to 2 stars.  I hope that this place gets their act together because I would enjoy their food more with better service.  I also think they should be open later than 4pm.  Seriously, who eats a meal at 4pm?",

They're always super friendly and welcoming, whether in the drive-through or if you go inside.  Food is amazing, as most of the other reviews have stated. I'm a tuna sandwich sucker, and this place makes me feel so much better about eating one. It's a \"healtified\" version, and it's actually even better than the original that's drenched in mayo. Burgers are yum, and I always love the teas they have. Prickly Pear seems to be a favorite of mine.  Parking lot sucks though. It's highly inconvenient, so be patient and careful while driving through or parking.",

Not over steeped, not burned...not weak, just right! Well, of course their food is incredible too : ) Anything you pick will rock your socks off.  Lemme say, while my dog didn't take the treat they offered (he's a brat lol) - the fact that they offered it was so nice. These folks care about what they're doing, and do it well.

This is a very nice deli and quick stop for a healthy munchie or tasty, cold ice tea on a warm Valley day.  Great outdoor space as well.  The vibe is casual hippie/hipster/health nut in a GOOD way.  My usual favorite for lunch is the cold tuna salad sandwich (NOT canned tuna) on wheat toast.  My breakfast fave changes, but with so many good options (burritos, sandwhiches, etc) I'm never disappointed.  Probably not the option for someone looking for pork, butter, grease-laden hangover breakfast.  But this place has cured an ill or two of mine...",

It's really built more to serve the drive-thru clientele.  Secondly, the food is overpriced. We spent the same here that we would have spent at a fancy sit-down brunch, but for less quality food and a less enjoyable atmosphere. Thirdly, I did not like the food all that much, my breakfast sandwich was just OK and it was on store-bought bread, not freshly baked. It tasted like warmed up leftovers. And my husband did not like his coffee or his sandwich. The ONLY redeeming thing about this experience was the Breakfast Buzz smoothie! Lindsay J. (another yelper) was right, it is delicious! It tastes like chocolate milk, and you can definitely taste the espresso, bananas and peanut butter. I might come back for that smoothie, but otherwise I probably won't be back.",

Carb-free breakfast - the person liked it! The only complaint... there were too many greens at the bottom.

My boyfriend and I both got breakfast burritos on a morning when we were feeling particularly hung over, but mustered up enough energy to get in an awesome workout and run up Camelback. After our run we stopped into this place. The burritos were perfect size, not loaded up with greasy cheese or meat, but filling in a way that didn't weigh you down.  After this outstanding breakfast we're definitely going to have an awesome day!",

Noise-level inside was a little loud, but there were eight people, six of w/c were talkative yelpers (ha!), plus Kyle and Chad, owners of D'lish (who were, btw, easy on the eyes... a great asset for any business!).  One special request- please offer Maya Chai!  While Oregon Chai tastes OK, I'm allergic (I suspect there are \"natural flavors\" involved), and organic Maya Chai is multiple-times better (and, most importantly, I don't recall feeling negative effects after)!  Great spot to unwind and rejuvenate.  Will come back soon to try the food!",

I like that I actually have to wait for my food to cook and it's not pre wrapped sitting under a heat lamp waiting for me. I like the happy, carefree (in a good way) personality of the staff. I love the food! The mushroom soup is something I crave! The veggie burrito is always piping hot and their salsa that comes with it is perfect! Salads, love! Chicken breast panini, love! I just wish it were across the street from my place instead of my boyfriends. Fresh, trendy, and consistent! Consistency is key and they have nailed it! Thank you D'lish!! Cheers :)",

My \"usual order\" is the \"Man Salad\" which is just amazing- lots of protein and good fats to keep you full all afternoon!  They are always so friendly EVEN when they're busy. The thing I like most, however, is simply how consistent they are. The salad is the same every time, their service is excellent every time, and they are as fast as possible every time. You see them hustling to get orders done as quickly as they can. The place is really just wonderful- keep doing what you're doing guys!",

I arrived and was starting to say what a friend recommended to me but I couldn't remember the name of it and the guy behind the counter snapped and cut me off and said \"I hear that ten times a day.\" Well buddy since you've heard it before, I can understand that working in the service industry, you'd not expect to hear it again (sarcasm.) Whatever, I made my order and was told to go relax at a table. Well, I relaxed for 18 minutes with no food (turkey BLT I ordered) and watched everyone else get their food. I got up and asked if I was forgotten and there was absolutely no apology offered, but said they would bring it to me.   When the guy brought over my sandwich, he kind of slammed it down on the table and walked away. No apology still, no offer to refund my meal, no come back later and try us again. They were just extremely rude about it. I understand, it happens... It's part of life, but they acted as if me not getting my food was a bother to them.  Horrible customer service. I'll tell everyone I know about this story. Nobody should be able to treat their customers like that. A simple \"I'm sorry, come back and see us again for a free coffee\" or something to that effect would have gone a loooooong way.   Too stupid to get it probably. Or maybe because I didn't have a rat-tail with a mohawk, a basketball jersey, converse shoes, and an obvious roid rage attitude, they just didn't care.",

Roughly 6:15, 6:30 AM. A guy was in there already with a smile on. Hard to find at that hour. I ordered a quad espresso with cream and the low carb breakfast. After he punched in the order I pulled kind of a d*ck move and asked for an extra egg. Told him he could charge me. He said no problem and told the cook to add the egg. Didn't charge any extra at all. Bonus! He had me test the espresso to make sure it was to my liking. It was fresh and strong. Cream was perfect.   Now the food. 3 perfectly cooked tender eggs on a bed of mixed greens with a pesto dressing. 3 tomato slices and 4 avocado slices. Also a thin hash patty. Everything was cooked perfectly and you could tell everything was very fresh. No weird tomatoes, no brown avocado. Everything was just right, even such an ungodly hour. The only recommendation I can make it put the hash patty on the side or on top so that some of the crispness would maintain. Other than that you can't get better service and quality and that early in the morning to boot. Highly recommend. I will be back for a lunch sometime.  PS I tipped him a few extra bucks before I pulled away. Well worth it.",

Ok the one down side to this place is also the best part about it- when you sit inside the blenders are constantly going off and they are LOUD buttttt these blenders are making the breakfast buzz! A delightful mix of peanut butter, banana, espresso and chocolate protein. Quite possibly the best way to start your day, or afternoon! If you're coming later in the day try the hummus and don't be afraid to still get a breakfast buzz. Your taste buds will thank me.",

Recommendations from me are obviously the buzz, (I get mine with almond milk which makes it a little more sweet), California club breakfast sandwich, croissant breakfast sandwich, man salad and Portobello soup, but like I mentioned before you can't really go wrong with anything you order.  If I had to give a tip, I'd say if you haven't been here before you should try to park and go in so you don't back up the already long drive through line.

You will spend the same and get high blood pressure. I also enjoy the veggie wraps on occasion. There is one with hummus that tastes unlike anything you have ever had from take out. If you eat your veggies, that is. They have meat eater food there, too. But when you go healthy, it seems better  to get some greens down the pipe!. Line of cars my only issue...dang.",

My friends enjoy their style of oatmeal as well as the black bean burger. It's great quality and the never let me down. The one thing that kind if sucks is their location. It's very small and the drive thru sometimes goes into the street. Not good! And parking is a bitch too. There's hardly any and it is just a very tight squeeze to get in.

When you walk in, the atmosphere is great, what with the snazzy furniture, friendly staff, and the plenty of customers in line, eager for the fresh food they serve up. Their menu is expansive and you might feel overwhelmed by all the breakfasts, soups, salads, wraps, sandwiches, are you feeling overwhelmed as I talk about all the choices that will overwhelm you?! Last time I went there, I ordered the nuts n' berries salad, the perfect toss of greens, blueberries, goat cheese, candied walnuts, and a raspberry walnut vinaigrette. It's perfect! I've also had their butternut squash soup, YUM! I try to try something different all the places I eat, and at D'lish, it'll be a while till I run out of new options. Go here!!",

The people who work here are genuinely happy that you walk in. They will chat with you if you want, or let you do your work on their free WiFi.  The Breakfast Buzz has been deservingly and glowingly reviewed here at length, and is well worth the hype.  One of the best surprises on their menu is their tuna sandwich. I am extremely fussy about tuna salad, and this one is my absolute favorite. I could go on, but your best bet is to just come on by and see (and taste) for yourself!",

And yes, when we arrived inside the cafe, it was booming with young, fitness going clientele. Nice. No limping people here.  My mom ordered the low carb breakfast which she seemed to love that included an egg with cheese covered in a pesto sauce over a bed of greens. It also included a hash brown patty.   I ordered the humanitarian wrap, which consisted of a tomato wrapper with an assortment of veggies including zucchini, yellow peppers, broccoli, tomato, quinoa and hummus. So good. Right up our alley.   We loved the food there but I think what we loved most was the staff member who pulled a table for us because he saw that we were eating our food without one. The place was really small and there were tables outside but it was hot as shit so my mom decided she wanted to sit inside even if we didn't have a table.   There was a large group of people next to us still chatting away after they had finished their food, so the staff member just kindly grabbed one of their tables for us, letting them know that we needed it to eat. That was awesome. Those people were totally oblivious to the two ladies sitting right next to them eating food on their laps, like that's something we would have chosen to do even if there were available tables.  Anyway, lovely place. Wide variety of great healthy food. Young crowd mostly. Tiny location. Great service. Can't wait to return.",

That amazingly good.  Iced tea is the bomb. I loved it. They have great flavors. Protein shakes are delish.  Hence the name of the place.  Rockin' to say the least. Breakfast salad was so good, I now crave it.  Sucks to crave something so far away. Quinoa oatmeal was also wonderful and healthy and tasty.  Basically, I think you are nuts if you don't like this place. I'm super jeals of all of the peeps that live out there that can eat at D'lish whenever they want.  As for people crabbin' about the price?  It's independent.  It's different. It's got a great vibe.  And the food is tasty.  Eat and hush up and enjoy.",

I went with my coworker to pick up a couple orders for the rest of the office; I forewarned the woman taking the order that it was going to be a couple different orders - on different cards- she reassured me that it wasn't a problem. Obviously, it became a problem. Another woman came to the window and snipped that if we wanted to make several orders we should have came in. They were not nice about it, and became obviously flustered. I felt badly, I know what a pain in the butt it can be. However, they were not nice - very rude and I felt my business was not valued. Needless to say I will not be going back; not because the food was bad but the service was very off-putting.(1/28/16) Went back today because those idiotic women charged my card twice. The manager there, however, was as nice as can be and gave me a gift card and was extremely apologetic. Looks like I will be coming back. (1/29/16)",

I've enjoyed several of the dishes they serve here: -The chicken panini ($7.25 with chips); the chicken, mushrooms and pesto were very good. -The Breakfast Buzz (peanut butter-banana-espresso smoothie) -The baja chicken soup and the bagel chips that go with it -Pomegranate green tea (not artificially/overly sweet) -Man Salad (Nice assortment of protein to fill you up) -Lo Carb Breakfast (2 eggs, avocado, & hashbrown on top of a salad) -The AZ burro (I only had a bite but seemed tasty and more filling than the regular sandwiches); saw someone eating this \"enchilada style\" (baja chicken soup on top) and it looked glorious.  Wouldn't try again: The hummus plate. The hummus itself wasn't that great and even though I usually like crudites, the veggies that came with it weren't standout either. Oh well, can't win them all. Won't deduct a star for this because of how good everything else has been.  The guy at the counter was really nice and friendly and didn't rush us to order even though it was getting busy.  Parking sucks (something like 9 spots?) and the drive thru line looks like it can get crowded fast, but I've had decent luck with it after 12:30 and when I call my order in ahead of time.  Also, God help you if you sit inside and someone orders something that needs to be blended (like a Breakfast Buzz). It gets really loud with that machine on. That being said, it's nice to sit at one of the outside tables when the weather is good.  I'll definitely keep swinging by as almost everything I try turns out to be quite tasty. As far as food goes in that area, it seems like one of the better options. Only wish they were open later in the day so I could grab something on my way out of work.",

It gets really busy on the weekends, so prepare to wait a while if you're there on a Saturday or Sunday morning. If you ever drive by on the weekend and don't see a line, you owe it to yourself to pull off and get something to eat.   I typically get their egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, and I'll add either bacon or chicken sausage. My wife loves the croissant sandwich, which has egg, cheese, tomato, bacon and pesto. We'll also typically get coffees or a blended protein drink or something.   It's a great place to come for breakfast and coffee, but at times, the wait is really long, and the food/service can suffer when it's really busy. I'll continue to go there pretty much every weekend. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "I have been coming to D'Lish fairly regularly for about 3 years or so. I enjoy the fact it's not a huge chain and offers healthier food options. I've eaten just about everything vegetarian or fish on the menu as well as trIed the smoothies and tea options. Recently after having been frustrated many times over the past few months I finally had to give up on this place. The parking is situation is horrible or the ability to turn into the drive-thru line. The business basically needs someone conducting traffic duties to control the situation. It really is a huge traffic situation that oftentimes blocks the curb lane and either forces you to be a jerk who also blocks the lane or just give up. The staff typically ranges from barely polite to outright rude and they have no public restroom on the premises so I would recommend against eating in because even washing your hands after or before eating is completely out of the question. While the food is good it's not so amazing as to make up for these problems. Save yourself the aggravation and go to one of the many other options in the area",

There's something about the cool cucumber sauce or the tangy pesto or the gooey melty sticky cheese and thick juicy tomato and can you see me drooling through your computer screen yet?   I am a vegetarian. Yes. So, the options at this lovely little restaurant fit my moral standards and they did so deliciously. On top of that, the staff is so friendly. They hand out free smoothie samples regularly, all of which are quite scrumptious. I will never turn down a free smoothie sample. Ever.   The only bummer was that at around one in the afternoon one lunch date awhile ago they had ran out of kombucha to pair with my quinoa burger. That was probably the only time that unfortunate drought had happened to me, though. It was quickly forgotten after a free smoothie sample was placed in my palm. Thirst: quenched. Stomach: filled. Wallet: thick. Stars: five.   Eat at D'lish, just don't drink all of my kombucha.",

It comes with chewy, soft bagel \"chips\" on the side and the salad itself is a pretty decent portion of yummy quinoa, lettuce (arugula?), and lots of other goodies. You won't get bored with this salad, that's for sure. This salad has bagel chips in it, which I was skeptical of at first, but they came in a separate bag and were soft and chewy, just like a bagel should be!  I've tried a few bites of other items like the breakfast burrito and the club, both of which were tasty. I've been wanting to try the burgers since they sound so delicious, but they're always out of them, even before noon!   As for drinks, I've tried the soy chai, almond chai, and dirty soy chai. I've gotta say, don't mess with perfection-the soy chai is where it's at! Also, their lemonade is BOMB, and I hate lemonade usually. The girl behind the counter said it's not homemade but it's \"really expensive\" lemonade they get delivered, and I totally believe her.  Only complaints are the hours (they close so early!) and the parking situation, which totally sucks. Parking requires Austin-Powers style maneuvers going from reverse to drive back and forth, but its totally worth it. Part of this is because they have a DRIVE-THRU, which is awesome, but the line is sooooooo long (all the time!), so it's worth it to just park and go inside or order if you don't call ahead. Also, you can call ahead and go through the drive-thru to pick up your order if there's no line!  Overall, cheap and delicious but lame hours and parking situation!",

I am usually on a very restricted diet no sugar no starch as well as the use of HCG and most diets now a days seem to be jumping on the same bandwagon.  Its all about eating clean.  Hormone free meats, fruits and veggies thats it so when I took a look at the low carb menu that came with hash browns for every low carb entree I was a little confused and disappointed but rather than try and decipher their menu I just told the lady taking my order that I needed something with virtually no calories like an egg beater omelet she said we can make you an egg white omelet which isnt really my preference but I figured my choices were pretty limited so I said o.k. then I sat down pretty much prepared to hate whatever they brought me.  These people know how to make boring egg whites taste good.  It came on a bed of greens with tomatoes and onions as I requested along with a few slices of avocado and a very tasty pesto sauce just enough to give it flavor.  I loved it and felt extremely satisfied even though it must have been under 250 calories.  I would definitely go here again and order the same.  Make sure you get there early for breakfast because seating is very limited inside and out.  There is also a drive through.",

The Oatmeal Our Way is a little odd because it's not oats, it's quinoa. Very filling but takes some getting used to if your mouth is expecting the mushiness of hot oats. The hummus comes with seasoned pita/naan and the smell is a little odd, but it all tastes good.  This place is the BEST fast-ish food place. I can't say 'fast' in all truth because I've often sat in the line for several minutes with other cars behind me. Good news is, that SHOULD mean they're taking time making your food even more awesome and not just slapping it together in uniform fashion like McD's or the like.  If you're coming here, plan ahead and either come early when you know you gotta be somewhere. The food is TOTALLY worth it.",

The food was mediocre but overpriced and the portions were small, pre-made eggs and such. There was trash overflowing, on tables, and all over the floor. Dead plants and open peanut butter containers sitting out for the MANY flies to get to. The service was bad. The man working was on his cell phone yelling about having money stolen from him and spent the rest of the time looking at motorcycles online.   I used the bathroom, which has no air conditioning and no working faucet. I got a glimpse of the kitchen and, again, it was worthy of  a cringe.   I was almost unable to eat my sandwich when it came. I was a little worried I'd get food poisoning.   Stay away from this location: bad service, expensive food, and extremely unsanitary.",

The rest of the menu is so great as well.  A bit pricey, but it is worth it.  Some more of my favorites:  sun dried tomato bialy, iced chai, frittatas, & the veggie d'lite.  I still have so much to try...& I will, it is just a little out of the way for my daily routine.  I wish they were open later...I crave one of their salads or a wrap after my evening workout, but i'll forgive them.  Another plus: they use a lot of organic & local ingredients & recycled products.   I'm a fan of the drive thru, even though you may as well park & go in instead of idling in your car while they make your food!  (just get out...it's better for everybody!)  The guys who work there are awesome too.  Basically, d'lish is the food I wish I could make for myself!  I might just go get something now....",

I read the great reviews so I got a little of everything to try it out: a soup, sandwich, and smoothie. The soup was excellent gourmet quality, on par with a top restaurant. The smoothie was excellent, very fresh and refreshing, more of the low-dairy, low-powder, high fruit type smoothie that is really cold and icey and has a sugary bite to it like you might make at home with a blender and some fresh fruit. On the sandwich I think I called a bad audible, as I read their cali club was great on my phone, then arrived to order and saw that included egg but I wanted lunch, so I switched to the turkey club. Although the turkey club had quality ingredients, I think the strong flavor of the whole wheat bread overwhelmed the subtle flavor of the turkey, which made the sandwich less flavorful overall. However, my friends said their sandwiches and coffee were great, and they made a good tuna sandwich. I think my friends and I will definitely return in future springs!",

The selection is limited and I think the price is misrepresented.  I would probably put it at least at $$.  For a simple tuna sandwich and a medium drink to put me back almost $11 without any sides.  For $6.50 I thought, this sandwich had better be amazing.  It was meh.  New flavors and combos with the tuna salad that I hadn't really thought of before, including diced carrots? Strange, but the flavors were interesting.  Sweeter than I would have liked.  I'm more of a savory lover.  All in all, I was not that impressed with the food and the price.  Especially since I could've gotten a bigger sandwich with a side of chips (or salad) and a cookie from Bread Basket Bakery for $.25 cheaper.

My breakfast go to is their breakfast buzz with almond milk. It's a quick, nutritious and equally delicious jolt of caffeine with protein. It's filling and it keeps me full until lunch.   For lunch, my go to is there tuna salad wrap. It's not your typical tuna salad, because they refrain from using mayonnaise (thank heavens ), I also sub out the wrap for a sundried tomato one. So good!",

    "text": "AMAZING spot for breakfast/brunch. Have not been here for other meals but wouldn't hesitate to come back and try.   My Order:  Croissant Sandwich w/ Portabello soup.  FOOD: 5/5 To begin to explain how amazing this was, I have to mention that I savored every bite and even tried to eat slower with smaller bites because I didn't want the flavors to end. The croissant is rich in flavor and balanced very well. The pesto was my favorite part and would recommend maybe asking for extra.   AMBIENCE/DECOR: 5/5 Small but cozy. It wasn't very busy when I came but can see this place getting quite packed. Drive thru line went out to the street. Parking is a bit of a hassle but there are plenty of nearby establishments you can park at.  It can get a little noisy as well when the blenders are running but it's expected for a small little place.   COST: 5/5 Cost is a bit high but it is obvious they don't skimp out on the ingredients and preparation. The food and the experinece is well worth it. Everything is fresh and healthy.   I can't wait to come back!",

We ordered my son a quesadilla and a green smoothie.  The smoothie was fine and the quesadilla was meh.  I would not come back, but it's just not my cup of tea.",

D'lish always has a pretty big wait and rightfully so. I ordered a banana strawberry smoothie that was killer and a AZ burrito BUT...I got this bad boy enchilada style. Best decision I've made her by far.  I've had the black bean burger, the bowls, the sandwiches but this burrito enchilada style is the best if I haven't made my point already! Service is always great and friendly and there isn't really much negativity I can bring to the table for this place.  Maybe one thing is to stay open later! There's not really a place like this and I'd come here a lot more if they were open later too. Keep it up D'lish!",

I wish they were open later in the day. For a quick healthy bite to eat I definitely recommend this place. My only negative would be one of the staff members she has been there both times I have been there, she mumbles and doesn't really smile.... if you don't like people, don't work in customer service!

This place is always packed for good reason but the wait to park or get through the drive thru takes a bit away from the appeal of a quick and healthy meal. That being said the speed is only slowed by the traffic. The food and drink are always ready promptly. The food is awesome and they are friendly to those with special diets. My top picks are the Breakfast Buzz, butternut squash soup, and California club. They have a soup and salad combo that hits the spot! Those are my top three but everything I've tried is very good and they have a patio that is doggy friendly.   The only other thing I might add is that this isn't the cheapest place but it's definitely worth it.",

This tiny little hot spot, was right off a busy road so naturally we missed our turn the first time, but found that they had a little parking lot located just to the back of it.. This parking lot also served as their drive thru, which a member of the staff actually came out to your car to take your order?  This would become a nightmare later as we were trying to leave the parking lot, since there was a NYC STYLE TRAFFIC JAM behind the restaurant!  We couldn't get out! Oh well that's the only thing keeping this place from being a 5 star!   The food was fantastic! I had the home maid black bean Veggie burger with a side salad!  It would be the first of many veggie burgers I would eat this week, and might have been the best! Really wonderful flavor, topped off with a little hot sauce, (when in Rome)!    We loved the out door seating, and the staff was super nice, as one of them was clearing our table told us of a few spots we could hit up while we were in town!  And gave us directions to Old Town!  I really wanted to try to Peanut Butter Smoothie, it looked and smelled gonza good, but I had to leave some room in my tummy for Beer by the pool!  Next Time!    Great staff, cool little space, only problem was that disastrous parking situation!  Walk here if you can! Or park on a side street!",

We scooted on over and waited in line. The line can get a bit long, but if you wanna go inside there is parking in the back. If you can make it passed the cars! If the line gets too long, they do get people out to take your order which is amazing. I love their food. Their beet salad IS AMAZING. Their Turkey wrap IS AMAZING! The breakfast buzz is amazing.

The parking lot is very small and with the drive through it can be a pain to get into the lot and find a spot. Once you do you can walk inside where you will find a moderate amount of seating and a small outdoor patio.

I also like their salads, other breakfast sandwiches, lo carb breakfast bowl, and southwest bowl.  We order lunch sometimes for our office from here as well.  They always get or orders right!  The final thing I'll mention is that I love that they offer doggy bags (leftover turkey and rice) for only $1.50 each!  I'll usually get these as a meal replacement for our pups when I want to treat them.    Edit: I still love their food, but their pricing is ridiculous.  I subbed a different cheese in my burrito and they still charged me for it.  The girl even told me when they sub a cheese they have to charge extra for it.  Pretty crappy business practice.",

ONE SMALL HASHBROWN. Where's like idk everything else on this order? Lol had to go through the long inconveniently located drive thru so we aren't able to just turn around as we drove away not realizing our order. On top of that, my friend who ordered a cappuccino has his LARGE coffee with literally 1/4th of the cup filled. We tried to say something at the drive thru by asking if there was even coffee in here since we had to drink it and after 3 seconds of dipping the cup back, we finally make contact with a poor taste of liquid. Aka this cup isn't even half filled and he got a large.... I'm confused. Maybe I'm just frustrated that I drove away with A HASHBROWN. Like if I wanted this I would've gone to McDonald's",

I had the egg and cheese bk sandwich but without the cheese +bacon on a bagel as they were out of the bread it normally  comes on and it was ok. Prob need to add some salsa or sauce to it. It was fresh tasting tho. Also decided on a decaf coffee which was on the menu board but then I was told they actually don't have a decaf that they make but could do a pour over ... i.e. an Americano. I was like ok well do I get the same price and was told no that I would be charged for an Americano. I say okkkkkk.. Prob should take the decaf house off the menu board then .. Just sayin. .. So I opted to pay the additional price for the Americano and didn't like it at all, so I dumped it.  My kiddo ordered the bk burrito and the Italian soda with vanilla which she enjoyed. I noticed that the Italian soda had one price on the board but I was charged .50 more so I brought that to the cashiers attention and she said it was tax. I said no taxes are on the bottom of the receipt and it is not .50 tax on a $2.50 item . She spoke to the mgr and he told her to refund me the .50, so that was taken care of quickly and professionally. All in all ok place for me but not one I would frequent tho.",

The ice tea is always great, and I enjoyed my smoothie - but the oatmeal... terrible! It appeared to be warm milk with some grains, apples and bananas. I thought they forgot the oatmeal! My co worker (whom I bought it for) and I were very confused. I glanced at the menu before I wrote the review and realized that no, they didn't forget it, there is no actual oatmeal in the oatmeal. They call it \"oatmeal our way\" and list the ingredients as quinoa, maple drizzle, fruit, granola and steamed milk. OK maybe my fault for not realizing it didn't list oatmeal as an ingredient but seriously.. Don't call it OATMEAL. For $6.00 I was very disappointed. I don't know anyone that would enjoy it. It was a 20oz cup filled with 80% milk and some fruit and the quinoa. I gave 3 stars because usually their food is good, overpriced, but good. But seriously, think about offering a disclaimer or something.",

My gf and I tried this place out and I was really shocked at the letdown. I ordered a bfast sandwich and it arrived cold and really didn't have much flavor. I didn't try anything other than that so maybe there are better choices that I missed. Hopefully we will be back in the area and can give it another try. Yelp has never let me down so it deserves a second chance. I will write another review after my next experience.",

No bathrooms in premises, you have to walk to a nearby bar.   But if you are OK with that stuff, the prices are good and food fresh and tasty.",

I have been eating a bunch of fried food so I craved a salad and even though this salad isn't the healthiest of salad it definitely was satsifying. It was a pretty big salad for under $10 and I loved the wooden bowl they served it to me in. I like the concept of fast healthy food since they had a drive thru but I opted for the dining in option. I went up to the counter ordered and they gave me a number and deliver the meal to my when it was ready.  It reminded me of a small hole in the wall coffee shop with plenty of great food options. I would love to come back here and try some of the sandwiches and other types of salads.",

I couldn't really taste it, even tho girl taking our order said some people don't like it bc they could. Perfect choice for a healthy sit down or on the go brunch- will definitely be back :)",

I loved it so much I went back the very next day.  I talked to the pretty girl at the counter and I found out that they started as a coffee shop and have been adding more food items to the menu. It's owned by this really cool young couple and you instantly become a part of the family when you come inside. But if you're on the go, there is a drive-thru! Also, free WiFi internet!  I had the california club which has eggs, turkey, pesto, avocados and cream cheese (and maybe some other good stuff) on a low-carb bialy bagel. I also tried the kombucha, an interesting alternative to coffee that will really pop open those eyes for the day.  Whether you're on the go or you want a mellow atmosphere to read, talk, drink coffee, make friends, eat good food, D'Lish is your new hang out.",

The only reason I gave it a 3 star review, is because I feel like the portion size wasn't very satisfying (or maybe I was really hungry that day) and the parking situation there is horrible.  They have a drive thru, but I opted to go in and eat lunch inside.  When I came out, the drive thru line was long and I couldn't back out my car because of the way the parking lot and drive thru is set up.  Not ideal, especially when you're trying to get back to work from your lunch break.  So in short food is tasty, but for me personally, the parking sitch alone makes me want to not go back.",

No, there isn't a great deal of parking, but there's enough... and going inside is usually faster.  Like everyone else...

On top of that, the restaurant isn't very big either - small as well.  My friend ordered a salad - it was large, filling and had lots of goodies in there.   I ordered the hummus dish with feta on the side. I don't particularly like feta...ehhh.... Hummus was delicious and garlicky.

I know a breakfast sandwich doesn't seem like a complicated item to make but this was by far the best I've ever had.

You can either go thru the drive thru or come inside and order and sit down and have the food come to you!  It's not very spacious inside...",

I've never parked or gone inside this location - so I was unsure how it worked. I accidentally parked in the no parking zone, which isn't really obvious if you've never been here or only used the drive thru.   While waiting for my food I was called out by (I'm assuming one of the managers) about my car. She was pretty rude while telling me I could get them in trouble and that I was causing problems, and to move my car. Luckily the friendly girls behind the counter thanked me for purchasing food and said they would bring it out to me if I pulled around. I feel like they sensed her aggressiveness.   Just not how you treat people taking time out to come inside your restaurant. She could have been polite, explained the situation or said thank you! I obviously had no intention of parking in the wrong spot. Not a very welcoming experience :(",

If you go inside, it's really small with around 8 tables that seat 2 and a couple of counters for singletons with additional seating outside. Don't let the tight quarters fool you- there's plenty of food options.  It makes me think of modern hippie style.  They offer breakfast or lunch varieties. There's even a kid menu. I love the options of food that are all fairly healthy (when you're comparing to chicken and waffles). I ordered the AZ Burro which was SO good that I'm craving it while I write this review. Typically I'd only eat half of it, but it was so good that I ate the entire thing. That's a great way to gain weight! I left feeling fuller than should be allowed.  Definitely a place to return to.  Just be prepared for their parking lot whether you're going through drive thru or dining in. It's awkward and really small.",

Toasted warm bread and the best ingredients all in one sandwich: eggs, bacon, smoked turkey, pesto, avocado, pepper jack, and cream cheese. But I skip the cream cheese. $8 of goodness. Yum yum yum!  I've also tried the croissant sandwich: egg, bacon, tomato, and pesto! Also crave-worthy! $6  The Humanitarian: hummus, quinoa, broccoli, tomato, cucumber, pepperoncini wrapped in a healthy sun-dried tomato tortilla. $7 of healthy deliciousness   I've enjoyed their D'breakfast buzz and protein shakes on the go!   I meant to try more items on the menu, but unfortunately I've been stuck on the California Club one too many times!   So I guess I'll try my best to try something new next time.

Everything I needed was included - cups, lids, stirrers, straws, napkins, sugar, which made setting up super easy for me!

I didn't have as many potatoes in mine as my husband did but the main thing that caught my attention was the seasoning - or lack of. We both thought the burrito was close to bland but was great with the salsa. I had asked for sour cream but they said they didn't carry it, which is fine.   I got the mocha latte as well, which is just chocolate syrup added to the latte but was pretty good. Can see why this place is so popular, healthy and affordable.

I had ordered two of my favorite sandwiches, and both weren't packaged burnt black. I wish the person making would've thought to themselves about how gross or unprofessional it is, to just package up a completely burnt breakfast sandwich, and just made a new one. My boyfriend and I continued to eat it because we truly had been looking forward to this meal.",

This last time I had one of the paninis and it really hit the spot.

I've never been a fan of coffee or anything that tastes like the stuff, but this drink defies all odds.  It's like drinking a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  Whenever I make it back to the desert...

The restaurant itself is basically a drive thru type place with a slight coffee house vibe on the inside.  They weren't slammed but were pretty steady, and were able to move customers through quickly.  I had the veggie burrito, which was pretty good and cheesy, and was served with a very tasty, very mild salsa which gave it some flavor it otherwise would have been lacking.  Tanya had the veggie frittata, which was also quite good and was served on toast, which was a little more than lightly buttered, but that's okay.  Broccoli for breakfast ain't really my bag, but she seemed to be okay with it.  The place seems priced about right, and it's nice to finish breakfast out and not feel like a big fat whale.  For that alone, this place would get my recommendation, but they manage to make healthyish food taste pretty good, too.",

We ordered the tuna sandwich and the early bird burger (which is not a burger, but a patty made with quinoa) and went halfsies on them, which is easy to do because they come cut in half already. To drink I got the kombucha, which I believe is GTs Original, and my boyfriend got the lemonade. Overall, our experience was excellent. The tuna sandwich was fresh and well flavored. The early bird was also good, but for me it was a little bit too spicy (and I love spicy), though my boyfriend who loves-loves spicy thought it was excellent. The ingredients tasted fresh and the food was reasonably priced for the quality and portions. The service was excellent and the staff very helpful. Our food came out quickly and so we were able to enjoy a healthy, delicious lunch in less than 30 minutes.",

I am always looking to try new places and lunch of course is a constant challenge that we are faced with every day...especially whilst working Full-time.  Being in Downtown Scottsdale, you can't not try a new place a minimum  of once a week.  ANYWAYS, I'm a breakfast guy and after a morning work out I felt like trying out their Breakfast Buzz and AZ Burrito.  BOTH were just delightful.  The drive thru has been packed the 2x i've been there and now I know why.  The Breakfast Buzz is just a great protein shake w/ espresso that really gives you the jolt for the day that you need in the office.  The AZ Burrito also was just on point w/ that smoked turkey and egg white.  Neither were overly filling and I was just set for the day.  Usually I get the office some Starbucks to start the Friday off right, but this week there were requests for breakfast buzzes instead.    Quick, D'lish and healthy.  Can't really beat that.  Definitely one of my go-to's for breakfast/lunch.    Cheers",

The food is good and some would say the food is great, but inside is simple and loud due to coffee machines. Driving through is better.  It's easier to take the food to go but don't go here during lunch. The traffic is so backed up, it's not even safe sometimes. I once sat in the median on Scottsdale Rd for 10 min just waiting to turn into their lot. If you come from the South, cars get backed up in the right lane and actually stop in the road. In a larger town, the cops would be here demanding these guys stop blocking traffic and get out of the median.  I highly encourage you to try the food, however. The other location in Tempe is certainly worth the drive to get there.",

When I arrived they were plenty of people pulling into the drive thru.  Since I couldn't figure out what to order, I went inside.  The staff was cordial.  I decided to keep it simple and ordered a traditional burrito.  I was so excited!  I got home and bit into it and \"crunch\"!  I tried again..more crunch!  Broken egg shells in my burrito!   Needless to say I lost my appetite.  I called to let them know I was bringing the burrito back and no I didn't want anything else (they offered).  Although they were very apologetic, I'm just not sure I can bring myself back to trying something else.  D'lish was a D'isappointment :(  Maybe I'll give the new Tempe location a try *sigh*.",

It's been about a month since I had the pleasure of ravaging this for lunch, but it hasn't left my mind. Even though D'lish was out of buns, the toasted sourdough bread they put it on was good enough for me to consider asking for that instead from now on.  First off, it's only $8.50 for a meal that will keep me full for at least 6 hours after. The burger itself (a mix of quinoa, black beans, and some other nommy things) is massive. It's the kind of burger that squishes out of the side of the bread when you bite into it. Awesome. It's topped with all kinds of fresh veggies, and then the bread is slathered with cucumber sauce on one side and pesto on the other. It's unreasonably good. Sound like a lot? It is. It might be 1,000 calories... but you know what? It's 1,000 calories of really freakin' delicious stuff.",

Well, it's been a while since I have visited because I have a three year old, so drive-thru's are always the better option for me to grab a drink and a bite to eat. We are always baffled that people will sit in the drive thru line which sometimes starts on Scottsdale road.  Today, I had time to wait as I needed to put my makeup on anyways. I look at the time so I could anticipate s possible future trip and what do you know, i had my breakfast sandwich and large green tea in hand in 6 minutes. I love it and am so proud that the local place can beat McDonald's across the street in a timed busy drive-thru race. The Cali breakfast sandwich was better than I remembered. I will never be afraid of their long drive-thru line again.",

I tried this place for the first time about a week ago and there was a pretty solid line through the drive thru. I was extremely impressed with the friendliness and efficiency of the people who work there.   They have an extensive menu and I am sure many people (like myself) order food as well as a beverage when they go through the drive thru. For their location this can cause a bit of a squeeze as the line starts to get longer and longer and as does the wait time. But fear not!! A lovely D'lish employee walks outside, takes your order and payment, and BAM. Next thing you know, you have your delicious coffee and you are on your way! Don't fear the line. Seriously, you'll be taken care of.  As far as food goes, I've only tried the egg and cheese sandwich and it was a delicious breakfast indeed. Next adventure? the oatmeal. Enjoy my friends, and get your D'lish ON.",

It's in a small building, like an old fast food restaurant, complete with a drive thru.  We knew we would be OK when the drive thru line was backed up 5 cars deep into the street.  That kind of traffic means that somethings going way right here.  My wife had the the club sandwich and I had the low carb breakfast.  Both of us were blown away with how good everything was.  The menu has a lot of interesting items.  Ones we are going to try now and replicate at home.  If you are looking for an overpriced and fancy place, this is not the place for you.

Great combination of salads, unique and healthy sandwiches, a bonus of tasty protein shakes. The atmosphere is still good as well-kind of trendy, but good mix of students and locals. The parking and drive thru are still cramped (nothing they can do there), but they've improved the drive thru speed by taking orders carside during busy times. Which leads me to the biggest update... happily, the real change and improvement comes from their service. I remember a time when service here was slow and painful. No more. The new crew is pleasant, helpful and competent. Hallelujah.",

About a week ago I stopped in to get a coffee after dropping my wife at work. I was told it would be $1 and some change. I signed my receipt that said $1 and change and went home. Later in the day i'm paying bills and see the charge from D'lish as $6.56 on my bank history. All i got was a coffee. So the cashier at the drive through clearly screwed up. Everyone makes mistakes so I'm not to bothered by this.   However, A week later i go back for some burritos and breakfast buzz. Everything seems hunky dory. Fast forward to the next day and I'm at work when i receive a call from someone who says they were in line behind me the day before at D'lish and they have my debit card. I look in my wallet and lo and behold I was given someone elses debit card when at delish the previous day.  Now i can forgive an overcharge. It's easy to fat finger a cash register but to give away my debit card to someone else is completely unacceptable. Part of the blame could certainly be on me for not checking but if you're operating a business I'm trusting you do things right. The fact that you messed up twice within 2 weeks is almost unforgivable. Still not sure i'll ever go back. If I do I'll definitely be bringing cash",

Seeing that there are no residences that close and I can walk, I can confidently say I will never give this place a nickel again.  I walk in to blaring reggae music, which is fine, whatever...but of course I have some douchebag in front of me with his girlfriend slowly dancing to the reggae music for a full 90 seconds while they are deciding what to order, if you want to groove to the music for 5...maybe 10 seconds, fine...but I'm hungover as fuck dude, quit dancing and order your gay salad with raspberry vinagarette and granola all over it. if I had any wish in the world at that very second I would have not wished for a million dollars or world peace, I would have wished for a hammer to instantly appear in my hand so I could hit him in the side of the knee as hard as possible so he would stop dancing and scream so loud that I wouldn't have to listen to the loud reggae music anymore either.  I order an egg and cheese sandwich with bacon and an orange juice.  Orange juice arrives at my table first. It was basically sunny delight orange juice. This establishment has the hippy tree hugger organic feel to it and you idiots can't make fresh squeezed orange juice? The sandwich comes a full 8-10 minutes after I order it. It was small had a small egg not that much bacon at all, whatever on the cheese, and sourdough bread. This all cost me 10 bucks. Place is a fucking rip-off. If you had brought me my simple order in less than 24 seconds (not 10 minutes) and had fresh squeezed orange juice (not 3 bucks for sunny delight). Then ok charge me 10 bucks and I'll be moderately happy, and would maybe return to eat there if I was 2 mins away from dying of starvation and happened to be driving by.  Then some guy walks in who I guess was the assistant coach of the ASU basketball team or something and one of the tree hugging hippy waaay too exuberant employees starts yelling \"clap everyone its so and so from wherever....\" and then made some joke like \"go UofA\" or something to mock him sarcastically. Shut up you dumb shit, I'm trying to consume your shitty 10 dollar egg sandwich in peace. Go smoke a bong in the back of the restaurant like you probably usually do anyway, or go stand in front of your restaurant with a sign saying you want it legalized so I can run you over on my way out. Then I leave and I'm walking to my car and reggae dancing douchebag from earlier is feeding his girlfriend from his fork on the outside patio. Ugh. Everything about this place made my head want to explode.  And all you people who give this place 5 stars should be immediately transferred to the island of molokai like they did with all the people who had leprosy decades ago.

All the staff is super friendly. I had my dog in the car and they were all so excited to see her and give her a treat. Great experience overall and would highly recommend. The parking lot can be a little cramped and annoying, but that's not really their fault.",

To begin with, I rolled up to the drive thru with my dog in my lap, making a fuss, and the woman at the window could not have been any nicer! She gave Danny (my Pom/Schipperke mix) a treat, which he happily gobbled up.  Next, I ordered the Breakfast Buzz. Took 2 minutes for the drink, and the gentleman who gave me my drink was very friendly!  Finally, my drink- OMG it is SO GOOD! I'm hooked. Chocolate, peanut butter and bananas, what is not to like? I can't wait to try their food!   Friendly service and good food make this place a must!",

It is worth it because the food is healthier and catered towards people on the go that don't want fast food..and the menu is also very vegetarian/vegan friendly. I enjoy Dlish and mostly everybody in Scottsdale knows about this place by now and if you don't then you're missing out. Five stars for friendly service and tasty meals.",

I had the low carb breakfast, husband had the AZ burrito.  Low carb breakfast had a very good flavor, but way too many oils.  Oily salad dressing, drizzled with an oil-heavy pesto, two eggs cooked in oil, and then an avocado for even more fats.  The flavor was very good, but I just felt like it was a pretty heavy dish for what it should have been.  My husband liked his burrito though!  We also split the breakfast buzz shake.  Our bill was $19.50, slightly over priced in my opinion.   It is small inside, so seating might be an issue if you go during peak hours.  Also, their smoothies and shakes seem to be popular, so the blender is literally always raging... Makes conversation too difficult.  There is absolutely no denying that parking here is a nightmare.  The parking lot is too small to begin with, and then the drive thru line always blocks people in their spot.",

I love that I can make healthy eating choices on the go by using their drive-thru! I will say that their drive through is typically slammed to the point where no one can pull in to wait in line or park to go inside. Parking is also very limited and poorly designated so much so that there have been many times I have parked to run in to get food and when I came back out I've had to wait 5-10minutes just to get out of the parking lot. Obviously, the food here is AMAZING and well priced otherwise I would never waste my time going here but I had to give it only 3 stars because it can be VERY time consuming depending on when you choose to go. They have very limited seating both inside and outside. They are known for their \"Breakfast Buzz\" which is a protein shake and happens to be what I order every time I visit. They also offer a \"Vegan\" option when making this shake that is also D'lish! They have a good selections of healthy food options, the service is quick once you have placed your order and the staff is SUPER friendly and deserve an A+!    If you are looking for a healthy menu and you are NOT in a rush then this is the place for you!",

The perfect warmth of the bread and flavorful taste of the pesto puts other club sandwiches to shame. Definitely enjoyed every bite of this sandwich  My fiance got the breakfast club ($6.00). Nothing special about this sandwich...it tasted rather bland or maybe the sundried tomato bread overpowered the items inside the sandwich (turkey, tomato, eggs, bacon, etc).   Also got a caramel iced coffee. Very very good. Not too sweet, not too strong   Obvious that this is a very popular spot. The drive-thru line was sticking out into the street. While we dined inside (very small), many patrons came in to pick up their orders. Guess that's the norm there... I'd come back and repeat my order if ever I'm back in Scottsdale (California Club and Caramel Iced Coffee)",

    "text": "Busy little place.  Stopped in at around 10:30 AM and found a table near the window.  Be prepared for a noisy atmosphere.  They play music while you dine, but it has to compete with kitchen noise and patron conversations.  I would recommend sitting outside.  Decided to order the egg and cheese sandwich, with their chicken sausage and a Glorious Orange smoothie.  Total price was almost $12.00.  The price for their smoothies is pretty standard: $5.00 for a large.  However, $6.00 for a sausage, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich is a little steep.  Not to mention the fact that I paid $1.50 for a few slices of sausage.  I'm not sure how they justify that cost.  The sausage added a nice flavor to an otherwise bland egg and cheese sandwich.  I also recommend spicing it up with some of their hot sauce.    They chose to use \"bialy\" bread for their breakfast sandwiches, which is an excellent decision.  The bread is soft and spongy, with a texture similar to a bagel.  All in all, the food wasn't too bad.  For me, the price is the main concern.  I don't want to fork out almost $7.00 for a simple breakfast sandwich.  With so many breakfast joints to choose from, I can't say that I will be back anytime soon.  Nice guys, though.  You should definitely visit at least once and say 'hello.'",

    "text": "The Breakfast Buzz is an excellent example of good milkshake engineering.   First off, there's just one size. That means only one method of preparation. It's nice not to regret ordering a size too big or too small. The cup is transparent so you can gage your consumption and not find out you're running low when the straw starts making that horrible inconsistent slurping sound. You have a good view of what's in there, you're not left in the dark blindly, dredging the bottom trying to pick up any last remnants.  The straw is big and strong enough to handle the shake and doesn't bend flat in your mouth under pressure like it would at Sonic or McD's. The Shake has the right consistency so you don't drink it too fast. On the other hand, it isn't so dense that your face goes turquoise and your eyes vacuum back into your head.   There are no cumbersome doodads like choc chips, ice or cookie that could obstruct the entrance to the straw preventing the flow of shake.   Lastly, the menu says it has vitamins,  proteins and fruits so you feel like you're making a healthy choice. As long as I BELIEVE it's good for me, I'll be ok right guys...?  I can understand why D'lish is voted so high. California Club is a nice sandwich and service is pleasant, but the milkshake, oh yeah, the milkshake is really quite good.",

The food is alright, nothing too special.  The prices are decent.  They do offer a lot of vegetarian options, which may be pulling in a lot of customers.  My biggest complaint is the service, which is truly horrible every time I go.  All the employees seem to be high school or college kids who absolutely HATE their jobs.  I am not exaggerating when I say that you will get significantly better customer service at the McDonald's across the street.  They have screwed up my order the last 2 times I went through the drive through.  I had to park two stores down and walk back, when I explained the mistake they tried blaming me for it-  I don't know how I could be more clear than saying \"A Traditional Burrito with sausage, please\"?!    I don't mean to rant, I apologize.  It's just exceptionally poor customer service and the food is average at best.",

I got their Breakfast club because its one of their most popular items.   It was good not as great as the other reviews say. The reason why I say that is because I feel it has the making of a great sandwich but they layer it wrong. You have bread, pesto, cream cheese, tomato, smoked turkey and bacon. Because the only texture you get Is the bacon if they put that on top of the cream cheese it would enhance your chewing experience.   Still tasty just mushy.  Hubby-Breakfast burrito with sausage and bacon and he loved it!!!! He came back two days in a row for it.  Next time I want to try the coffee and salads.  Great place",

When I wake up in the mornings I either have a thrift mentality where I drink my god-awful office coffee, or a \"I don't care that I'm completely going broke\" mentality where I head to D'lish.  I would say that I fall into the latter category most days of the week.  Everyone on the staff totally rocks.  I usually hate my entire life and everything in it at 7:00 when I roll through there, but I always drive away with excellent coffee in hand and as much of a smile as possible on my face.  The prices are totally reasonable, and although I'd be irritated about the fact that they have UoP propaganda all over their cups, I find myself wanting to support them and have whoever started this wonderful business to make millions and millions of dollars.  Like some fellow reviewers I would definitely recommend the Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  I generally stick with regular coffee in the morning, but every espresso drink I've had has been phenomenal as well.  Thank you D'lish for making M-F tolerable!",

Only thing....it's loud in the restaurant area because of all the blenders and barista sounds.  It's kind of challenging to carry on a conversation.  I recommend the outdoor patio seating when the weather's cool.    And...the drive through is not really a typical drive through experience.  Expect to wait approximately 10 minutes for your order while you're waiting in your vehicle (because of course, they are making your meal from scratch).

I'm not vegetarian, but i love a good veggie burger as something healthy & different, and theirs is quite possibly one the best in town. Including the ones i've had from full blown sit-down restaurants. Too many places just slide a veggie puck out of a box and throw it on a bun. Not these guys. Also, their coffee and iced tea are pretty dang tasty.  Only problem I ever have here is the wait. Definitely a place you have to be patient at.  Maybe it's better if you actually go through the drive-thru - I always just walk inside. Also, for $8.50,  was a little surprised that the burgers don't come with any sort of side item. Not a deal breaker, just something to keep in mind. And I'd probably come here more often if they had hours that extended into the evening.",

    "text": "Bless me Yelp for I have dined. It's been many months since my last review. It's actually been awhile since I've had much opportunity to check out new (to me) places. It has been a rough year.   Things are turning around though, and I'm D'lighted to get my review'n skills back in shape.   I'm surprised I hadn't eaten here before. I guess I didn't even really know it existed to be honest. I live within a few blocks of here and I love breakfast and I drive by here frequently. Perhaps it is because I'm not a member of the vegetarian/vegan community... though I've dated several vegetarians and vegans so I'm pretty up to date on the places to go for that.   I haven't had my food at this place yet - I've only eaten from the drive through. It seems like a cute little place though. One of these days.   The food is tasty. It's about as tasty as it can be for something that can be considered a healthy breakfast. I tend to prefer a good thick greasy unhealthy artery clogging pile of bacon and some sort of fruit covered waffle or french toast drowned in maple syrup - that doesn't seem to be what this place is about. Still... it's True to its name. It is definitely delicious.   Their prices aren't too bad for what you are getting. It's quality food. I mean, I was getting burned out on shitty fast food breakfast places. I can't stomach the Breakfast Club douchetastic crowd most of the time, and I haven't been really up for eating around any sort of crowd on my weekend mornings. I'd rather eat in the comfort of my own home these days.   I'll have to update this when I have more to say about it - so far, I've only really sampled the food. I have yet to really experience the atmosphere and the service. Sooner or later though...  I'd say this is yet another reason why I still stand behind my belief that Scottsdale is an awesome place to live.",

How can you go wrong with peanut butter, espresso, chocolate, and banana whipped up into a breakfast smoothie?  Fair-trade locally-roasted beans?  Kudos.   Ate in one morning with friends- cozy little indoor & outdoor spaces.  Had the low-carb breakfast- a pesto-ed fried egg salad and it was excellent.  So good I had to go back the next morning before flying home.  Tried the drive thru and grabbed a breakfast burrito (add some sausage & avocado for a cali-flair).  Perfect.  This healthy fast food movement needs to make its way West..  Come to San Francisco, D'Lish!",

As a creature of habit, I generally only order the same thing....the seasonal turkey sandwich called \"the gobbler\" with this amazing cranberry goat cheese spread. Not sure what I will do when they change the menu.   They have assorted iced teas as well: green, black, and cactus pear or cactus blossom. These are excellent when mixed with black tea. The last time I went thru, I noticed they had a \"doggie bag\" option, which is chicken and wild rice. That's an awesome option for anyone who takes their pet anywhere.  Additionally, this place is small.... But if the drive through is backed up, the guy that works the first window will come out with spare menus and take your order on the spot. I don't think I have ever waited more than 5 min for food.",

It's nice that they have almond milk for lattes and they can definitely cater to people with food allergies or restrictions.   The only downside is parking can be a total nightmare - there is a very small parking lot and if you go during peak lunch hours - really anytime between 11:30 and 1:30 - it can be impossible to get a spot, or even pull into the lot. They also have a drive through, but it can take quite a while.   As long as you're not in a rush, it's worth the wait!",

Next time I'll listen to Chris and get the \"Buzz\" which is \"patent pending\" and per C.B. \"one of the best inventions of the 21st century\"... I know what you're thinking, and I was afraid too. Hence why I went with the chai. Next time - I'm buzzin'!!",

Coffee was smooth and delicious as well. The crew was super busy, but all very friendly and helpful.   We sat outside and ate and were surprised that we didn't witness any car accidents. The drive through traffic is insanely busy and until you can get in the lot your car will be hanging out straddling the bike and right lane. The staff seems to do a super job of taking orders and delivering orders car side however.",

    "text": "Let me tell you a secret- AZ Burro. This is the epitome of the PERFECT hungover breakfast spot in restaurant history. When I lived in Scottsdale this was literally my favorite spot ever to go for breakfast. My only complaint about here is that they don't serve alcohol, but let's be real nobody is perfect. \"AZ Burro\" needs to be in the vocabulary of every person that likes to party in Scottsdale. Why? 1. It's pretty much the healthiest breakfast you can get without actually making it yourself 2. It's perfectly filling after a long night out at smashboxx/hefe/etc that ended with a late night at pattie's 3. It doesn't make you full to the point where you can't hit up RnR after to go day party and get started with some bottomless bloodys mimosas 4. (and most importantly) D'lish is drive thru! Making it ridiculously catered to the hungover person. Don't want to see everyone you blacked out in front of last night or run into last night's hookup? No problem. Just make sure that you are sober enough to drive (aka no alc for you Arizona peeps) and drive on through that drive thru people! I know, I know- it just sounds too good to be True but I promise I'm not making it up, this place really does exist. Also the Breakfast Buzz is really filling but I would honestly recommend it as a meal in itself or like a snack or something because I don't know if you would be able to handle it with a meal unless you're really trying to get down then in that case go big or go home. And at the end of the drive thru if you find that all this is just wayyy too healthy or you're over it, then Super Burrito is conveniently located next door. Don't worry, they have a drive thru too so you can still avoid seeing anyone :)",

They are always so packed which is obviously good but sometimes the drive thru line is just ridiculous, especially when people are sitting with half of their car still in the road. Also....good luck parking anywhere in that parking lot when there is a line in the drive thru. You are trapped. But that's enough negativity... Turkey Club, Breakfast Buzz, D 'Veggie Bowl, Tuna Sandwich, Veggie Burgers, Low Carb Breakfast, Green Tea, the list goes on. They also make a mean Dirty Chai. I wish they were open after 4pm....I can't tell you how many times I've craved it and looked at the clock...right at like 3:55pm. I also like how they come out to the drive thru and get orders rather than waiting for you to pull up to the window that does speed things up a bit.....and the fact that I typically know 90% of the people waiting in line at the drive thru. Nom Nom Nom",

The food was amazing, very clean, and healthy. They have everything from Vegan, to Gluten Free, and are able to add chicken to anything for you meat eaters. I highly recommend this place. My only criticism is their parking situation is a little less than desirable. It's a very small and tight parking lot, we even saw that someone's car got hit while parked.",

    "text": "Awesome concept, love the idea of a health-conscious fast food joint, but as far as \"fast\" goes I think they could speed up their game for their drive-thru just a bit.  Last few times I ordered food through the drive-thru it took about 10-15 mins for a drink and breakfast sandwich.  Plus, when I got the sandwich it was just a little bit sogalicious. However, today I thought I'd give them another try and sit inside.  Was a little more impressed with their service and food this go-around.  The guys working were cracking me up, very witty and sarcastic--kinda like the personable attitude of a West Coast coffee house; super laid back like hanging in a friend's kitchen.  I ordered their traditional breakfast burrito and it was very D'lish, not soggy but very hearty and filling, eggs were perfectly seasoned and loved the flavor of the salsa.  Definitely willing to try this place again, but from now on I'll probably sit inside or put in a pre-order.  Really wish their hours went a lot later through the evening instead of closing at 4pm. I think they could probably triple their business if opened at night given the location.  Update 08/25:  Just gave this place an additional star...I've been more and more impressed w/ DLish because they've definitely sped up their drive-thru game!  I look forward to continuing my dining business with them again and again!  Would rather support local cafes over any mega-tron monopolies (*cough* Starbucks).  Also, just recently tried their blackbean and quinoa burger...ummm yeah, very DEEElicious, super ++ !",

    "text": "My wife and I were looking for a place to get breakfast on the way to Phoenix Airport. We consulted our trusty Yelp app and found D'lish. It got great reviews so we thought we'd give it a try. When we pulled up, there was a long line at the drive through. I figured this was a good sign. The parking lot is very small and cramped and took some maneuvering to get into a spot, especially with all the cars at the drive through. We wanted to sit and eat so we went inside. The inside is very small and maybe would fit a dozen people comfortably. Luckily, there were only a few others besides us. We were a little confused when we walked in as we received no greeting. Do we just sit? Is there table service? Or do we just walk up and order? After realizing there is no table service we looked at the menu, which was located above the counter. The menu was written very small and was difficult to read. The inside is very loud mostly because of the blenders and the loud music that was playing. It was very difficult to have a conversation there and I could barely hear the woman taking my order. The noise level was so high I can't imagine it's good for the people that work there. I placed my order at the counter and I received a number to place on our table. I ordered the traditional burrito and my wife ordered the frittata. While we were waiting we noticed some not-so-customer-friendly signs. There was a sign that stated no public restrooms. We looked for the restrooms and discovered that there aren't restrooms to use even if your a paying customer. Then there was the old, \"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.\" Really? Come on. As a paying customer that really doesn't make me feel welcome. Anyway, back to the food. The food came out promptly and hot. My burrito was in a wheat wrap with eggs, potatoes, bacon and cheese with a side if salsa. The burrito was good, but not seasoned. The salsa was from a jar. I know this because I can tell and it was confirmed when I saw the container of salsa in the kitchen. I would of liked some D'lish home made fresh salsa. My wife's frattata was a baked egg omelette with cheese, and vegetables, hashbrowns on a thick piece of white toast. Drizzled on top was a spicy sauce. They also offer smoothies and vita shakes. The food was good, but the atmosphere and service were poor. I think I know why a lot of people were in the drive through line getting food to go.",

Being from New England (where we have perfected iced coffee), I am always a little skeptical trying the iced coffee. D'Lish has my favorite iced coffee in AZ. (Yes, I'm including the local Dunkin' Donuts franchise here).    Until the next time I'm in Scottsdale, I will pitifully attempt to re-create D'Lish's amazing breakfast burrito here in RI....",

    "text": "There is a place in Arizona where the convenience of fast food meets the benefits of a fresh, quasi vegetarian menu in a salubrious confluence of amazing food and drinks. This place is D'Lish. Didn't see that coming, did you?  While this place is great any day of the week, I usually like to include it in my weekend routine. What is that routine you ask, well I'll tell you. I wake up before sunrise and hike a mountain shaped like a camel. At the top, I fight a dragon who has swallowed a magical key that will unlock a room at the top of a tower that contains a riddling troll who will eat you if you cannot answer his three mind puzzles. After wrenching the key from the bowels of the flying beast, I realize I'm hungry, so I stop at D'Lish for an early morning meal, which delivers every time to satiate my heroic appetite.  The AZ Burro, the Protein Burgers (House style and early bird) are my personal favorites, but I have yet to eat something there I didn't thoroughly enjoy. I even like the frittatas, which I previously thought to be punishment disguised as food.  And then there're the drinks, which seem to have already been covered thoroughly by my fellow yelpers, so I'll just say this: I can see The \"Dwayne Johnson\" Rock drinking/eating a breakfast buzz. Or at least that's how I like to picture myself when I consume one.  Having devoured my breakfast burrito and protein peanut butter coffee drink, I continue my weekend quest to the tower with the troll, fueled by the life-giving offerings of D'Lish Kitchen and Coffee House.",

The first day, we parked and went inside - ordered breakfast sammy's: a California club and a breakfast burrito - with a cup of coffee.  Very good both - but as we watched what the Regulars were ordering and we continued to read and re-read the menu as we enjoyed our breakfast we realized we missed the BOAT (Best Of All Time) - that's right all you Regulars know what I'm talking about - The Breakfast Buzz shake!!! Vitamins, protein, espresso, nonfat milk, peanut butter, banana, chocolate all blended with some ice! Oh yeah, great start and keeps you going all morning!   Oh and you don't even need to get out of the car. - 'cause you don't need to sit down at a table to enjoy it.  Utilize the drive-thru - and you are all fueled up - drink and enjoy as you drive to the ballpark.",

Unfortunately, I am not living there lol Beside, they provide drive through but it's kinda slow.

It's not a restaurant in which someone waits on you. There isn't much seating. It's a small shack of sorts.   Their drive thru had a line the entire time I was there which is a good sign.

Paired great with the pomegranate green. ..and I also drank half my husband's four berry smoothie because it was so delicious. I'll be back to try the black bean and quinoa burger for sure. Highly recommend!",

I easily spent like 15 minutes on the cars line and waiting...an eternity for me considering this is a drive thru... Now the other costumers were also anxious they started to honk their claxon and well that's not nice neither... The prices are high for the quality and amount of food that you get. And the food is not really healthy at all! I will not come back and I will not recommend to anyone I care, so much trouble just for the wait to open my bag at home and find it's not at i was expecting from a healthy salad spot, no thanks!

When I go out for breakfast I like to order something I cannot easily duplicate at home- nothing on the menu is special.   The line boggles my mind. I'd say if you're looking for a drive-through meal your fine here.",

However, the prices are high, and the lot is tiny. They're supposed to be \"healthy to-go\" but the to-go process is super inconvenient. Most of the time, the line is backed up into the street so cars are honking at you. Parking is almost never an option unless you want to wait in the drive through line. I'm sure buying another lot next door isn't an option but if it is, it could seriously improve this place. Even with the inconvenience, I continue to come back for the food/service.",

Just the principle if you are out of a product it's not the customers fault so dont pass on the charged to them, makes me question just how cheap your kitchen quality is....  Put out a sign that you have no bathrooms and uour out of a certain item etc place just wreaks of lazy, sloppy, cheap. Welcome to Scottsdale, AZ. NOTE! Owner reached out, apologized and explained the bathroom situation and felt that their heart is in the right place and all. That said, strongly feel their bathroom situation should be clear on some sign before ordering and update the menus to better reflect what's being served and for how much. Have no probs paying just don't like feeling I'm being duped by some conflicting policy/ menu...",

    "text": "Met a couple buds from the AOB and S (Female). I picked D'lish so really this was all on me. There are just so many negatives to talk about first, BEFORE I even get to the food. First: Parking is a joke. There is such limited parking in the back of the restaurant that you might as well park down/up the street and walk. Second: There is NO BATHROOM. Now, regardless of whether or not this has been grandfathered into the creation of this place, why would the owners choose to have a \"sit down\" restaurant and then not provide a bathroom. NO BUENO. Leave this place as a drive-thru only and you're fine. As soon as they added the 7 2-tops to the inside and the 3 2-tops to the front porch, they should have added a bathroom. Three: The noise. OMFG. If you're sitting inside, which why wouldn't you, and someone orders a smoothie, fagetaboutit. You cannot hear. It is deafeningly loud. Have you ever been to a Jamba Juice and stood close to the machines when they run them? Well, imagine they picked up the machine and STUCK IT next to your ear. Seriously annoying. And, I will add that I'm obviously not the only one who thinks so because while we were sitting there a few customers sat inside only to move outside after being subjected to the noise and deciding there's no way to have a conversation. Now there was going to be 4 of us and there's no way to seat 4 outside so we tuffed it out inside. Four: Employee. You're NOT right. When a customer complains, brings up something that is making them unhappy or is otherwise not pleased with their experience. Your SOLE job is to fix it. NOT ask questions. NOT make them feel as if they're stupid or wrong. You (employee) simply smile and fix it. I realize it sucks sometimes and you probably want to kill half of the people you deal with on a daily basis. BUT, that's the job you've taken. I'll explain more on this momentarily.  So, T, S (M) and I were waiting for S (F) to show up so we ordered 3 Black Tea's. (32oz $3 ea). We took the 2 2-tops right in front of the counter because the rest of the tables were full. This was when we first realized how loud it was. It was funny but then NOT funny. The smoothie machine was just ridiculous. While we were waiting for S (F) to show up the two tables closer to the window opened up so we moved. Even being 3 feet further away from the noise had to help, even if it was just the tiniest bit.  So now we come to our problem with our server / employee. 2 of our Black Tea's tasted like crap. Actually, they tasted like there was Fish sauce with the tea. T said he thought it was because they were using Scottsdale Tap water. Seriously? Does Scottsdale Tap water really taste that bad? I live in Chandler and if my tap water tasted this bad, I would have moved long ago. The thing is, only 2 of the 3 had the taste and they were all the same drinks. Hmmmm. Regardless, we got the 3rd degree about it when we wanted to change them to green tea to see if there was a difference. There was. Then we were informed that they had gotten a new brewer the day before and maybe this batch, which they brew and then put in gallon water jugs to store, might be the culprit. EXCUSE ME. I assume they've run a few batches through the machine so we all agreed we thought this wasn't it. What I did think was the culprit was the gallon jug of Black Tea that had 1/23 date written on it. I doubt the tea was brewed a week ago, but, the plastic jug could have old dried tea rotting away on the inside. GROSS. Use a jug and then recycle it. Not a place to cut corners.  Onto the food. Only S (M) and I ordered food. I ordered the Southwest Rice Bowl ($8.25).  Steamed basmati rice, chicken breast, broccoli, shaved corn, black beans, enchilada & creamy cucumber sauces, topped with fresh cilantro & a side of toasted bagel chips. This was yummy. I think the portion size was a little wimpy, but the taste was great. Winner winner Rice Bowl dinner.  S (M) ordered The Man Salad ($8.50). House made tuna salad & sliced avocado served on bed of spring mix greens, chicken, bacon, feta, & tomato with a side of black bean azuki chips & creamy cucumber blue cheese dressing. S (M) said this was a great salad. All the flavors mixed very well together. Another winner.  So the problem is, there were just so many negatives BUT the food was great. So, use the drive-thru and get a 5 star experience. Stop and eat there, not so much. Since we ate there, this review is based on our experience dining in.  No Bathroom. Crappy Parking. Loud Machine. Not the best customer service. Great Food. 2 Stars.",

I plan on moving to the area soon and I already know this will be one of my go-to breakfast destinations!

It's a small, but comfortable coffee house that has indoor and outdoor seating along with a convenient drive-thru for those on-the-go.   We ordered the new \"Man\" salad, margherita pizza and tomato basil soup. The man salad is quite a combination of flavors. It has a huge lump of tuna salad, avocado, bacon, blue cheese crumbles, tomatoes with creamy cucumber blue cheese dressing. The margherita pizza was small, but tasty. It's perfect for smaller appetites. Not a massive fan of the tomato basil soup. It was a little too salty, but not bad.   All in all, we had a great experience there and will definitely be back to try a few other menu items and the coffee.",

A few minutes later, our waiter takes our drinks to a table across the room. This table realizes they have the wrong drinks and returns them to the counter. This is no big deal, I won't freak out over this. The waiter then brings the drinks (with the same straws used by the previous table) to my friend and me. I ask for new straws. The waiter then tells me \"I just made these and I took the paper off of the straws.\" Why did he lie about this? I try not to make a scene, but he continues lying to me and refusing to just get two straws for a full five minutes before I reveal that I have watched where the drinks have been, I know that he did not \"just make\" them, and he was not the one handling the straws. He makes a scene and lays into me with a very sarcastic tone. I didn't eat too much of my meal. When your waiter lies about sanitary issues and mocks you in front of a crowd, your appetite goes away.  This was probably my fifth or sixth visit to D'lish. In the past, the service has been okay and food is pretty good. But I have no problem with never eating here again.",

Peanut butter & banana. Daumnnn so so good. I make amazing smoothies everyday in my Vitamix and this murdered my recipe. It has me jonesing for more less than 24hrs later.   The bad: this isn't their fault, but entering southbound from Scottsdale Rd at 1130am on a weekday is a nightmare. Parking is minimal. Restaurant is small.   Big complaints: blender running constantly, and due to the small size of the establishment, it makes conversation super difficult and annoying. I hope they read this review and consider moving it to the back.. (hint hint). Sandwich portion size was somewhat small, and my friend got a wrap that looked small as well. We both ended up buying the Breakfast Buzz smoothie after eating our lunch because we were both hungry.   Overall, the food is bomb. Super clean, healthy, unique recipes. Don't plan on coming here for a quiet date or a meeting. The drive-thru is the way to go, it seems, and ordering ahead would be my advice as well. I'm definitely going back. Sooon.",

I didn't have to wait to place my order, and the cashier answered all of my friend's questions quickly and courteously. He was also very patient in waiting for us to decide what drinks we wanted since we hadn't planned on getting any until he asked.  The dining area inside is very small, but we were able to get a table even with the area pretty busy. There were plenty of spots to sit at outside, as well. While waiting I noticed that the music was a little too loud. It made talking with my friend difficult at some points. The atmosphere of the place is very chill, though, and it lends to casual dining.  Our smoothies arrived in a few minutes and our food was there shortly after. I ordered the berry smoothie, and it was very tasty. My friend ordered the strawberry-banana smoothie, and it was just as good. For food, I ordered the California Club. It has egg, bacon, turkey, pepper jack, cream cheese, avocado, tomato, and pesto on Artisan bread, if I remember correctly. It was fabulous! Like I said, I don't tend to eat healthy food (I'm a meat and potatoes kind of girl), but this definitely hit the spot. Everything tasted fresh, and I really enjoyed the cream cheese addition. I didn't notice much avocado on the sandwich, though, but I also wasn't inspecting it very closely. My friend ordered the Chicken Breast Panini, and he says it was \"delish.\"  The employees noticed we were sitting around talking, so they came by and picked up our plates and trash to free up some space on our table for us. They were very polite and asked us how the food was. When my friend mentioned I was a Yelper, the employee seemed delighted to hear that. I mentioned that there were good reviews for the place, and he said that he reads them often. It's always nice to hear that businesses pay attention to what is being said by customers!  Overall, I had a great experience at D'lish, and I'll be sure to go back!",

We had breakfast, the frittata and the breakfast croissant sandwich. The eggs were over cooked to the point they were rubbery tasting. The staff was nice but other then that, not a place I would visit again.",

The only thing I've had that I didn't really care for is the Breakfast Burrito, but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu.  It's a long wait in the drive thru 99% of the time, but it is absolutley MORE than worth it.",

    "text": "At first I was confused by D'lish, how can drive-thru be healthy? I walked in to meet a friend and fell in love with the small menu (Side note: I dislike big menus - they overwhelm my indecisive self)! How often can you go somewhere and get a dish made with quinoa, being that I am recovering vegetarian, I was super excited! Then he brought out this \"pasta\" dish and as the name states it was D'lish! The great thing about D'lish is that each dish is freshly made with locally grown produce. I've been there several times and everything I've had has been refreshingly healthy, balanced, and tastes great.   The owner keeps telling me that I need to come in and try breakfast but since I live in Gilbert I have yet been able to make it over. Maybe one of these Sundays, I'll stumble in my dancing heels from the night before to try their breakfast sandwich and the infamous \"Breakfast Buzz\" shake, which according to the owner is THE cure for a hangover.   P.S. The hype surrounding the Dirty Chai is well deserved because it is as fabulous as my new dancing heels!",

I have only done the drive thru and considering the quality of the food, it was really fast! The iced coffee is amazing on staff recommendations I have had the California Club and the Humanitarian Wrap, & I was very happy with both! Today I had the Tuna Sandwich and can honestly say I've never had a better one!! I am quickly becoming a regular, can't wait to try the rest of the menu!!!",

I'm glad we didn't leave cause the food was great.  I got the low carb breakfast and also sampled my husband's quinoa \"oatmeal\" (delicious with just the right amount of sweet and fresh fruit) and egg sandwich (cheese to die for and some very good chicken sausage).  My husband's complaint (beside the sort of assclowny guy behind the counter) was that the menu did not make clear that the egg sandwich was a fried egg rather than scrambled and that the oatmeal would be quinoa rather than regular oatmeal.  As we were sitting eating the CSA arrived with the days vegetable delivery.  Buying local from the farm?  No wonder it tasted so good.",

    "text": "7:45am on a Thursday morning is NOT the time to drive thru this place. I have eaten here before and the food was definately better than average. So I decided to stop in for the breakfast burrito, or maybe even some of their awesome oatmeal. Unfortunately, after waiting 10 minutes in the drive thru, and noticeing that for at least a minute the driver in front of us had fallen asleep waiting herself, my wife and I just couldn'rt wait any longer and drove off. Unfortunately, I had to get my coffee and a sub par muffin from Cirkle K AND be late to work.  What makes this somewhat frustrating is that they HAVE 2 drive thru windows that when utilized properly could probably speed up the drive thru process. The first DT window is covered up and NOT used at all.  Just a shame, the food is good...I just won't be driving thru on a weekday morning again. .",

And I refuse to get a hyper flavored concoction that have 3,758 calories. I like to eat my calories, not drink them thankyouverymuch.  Since it's hotter than the 6th circle of hell, I decided for iced coffee. I always pass d'lish on my way to work and decided to finally try it. The interior is tiny, it feels like a cool doll house to me. I had an iced coffee and wow!!!!!! It was amazingly good. I tried another day ( and another and another) to make sure it wasn't a fluke and I'm glad to say it wasn't. My iced coffee has been equally great every single time. I also had a bialy with cream cheese and it was very tasty. I'm looking forward to try their hot coffee once is not  115* out.",
