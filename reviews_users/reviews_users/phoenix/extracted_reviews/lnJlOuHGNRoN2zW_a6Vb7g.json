Only reason for a missing star is that they don't allow for split checks, not because there system can't accommodate it, it's just there policy. Bring cash if you are coming in a group or just go somewhere else because that's such an inconvenience.",

Each server we've had has been well spoken and informed and has given great food and drink recommendations. If you've scrolled past the tips section of this restaurant, you might have seen a couple of tips from me stressing the fact that the carnitas tacos are insanely good. Well, I'm gonna beat a dead horse here and say it again: the carnitas are so friggin' tasty. I recommend trying the chips and salsa to start, the salsas are super fresh and spicy. We sat at the bar and really enjoyed our conversation with the bartender, he was really friendly and accommodating of any questions. This is a place I'm hoping to frequent often. If this long-winded review has bored you, here's the TL;DR- Eat here and order some drinks, you'll be glad you did.",

Talk about dodging a bullet the first time and getting shot the second time. Talk about overpriced, reductive, basic food and drinks. I sat here and drank their \"special\" margarita which surprisingly was the same price as the menu margarita. Ok fine. Then my friend ordered the chicken skins and they were completely burnt. We sent back two different margaritas and then our tacos came. They were the size of a teacup saucer and so heavily dressed that the actual food on them was just a mayo salad on corn bread. Good luck in the future you're gonna end up the usual American business that goes out of business within 10 years. We couldn't even split our bill at the end. Oh and Happy Margarita and Taco Day!",

The bar tender, Mr. Redding is on top of his game and has a vast knowledge of Tequilas, Whiskey, and Mezcal (even though I can't get him to like it). The level of service and quality of libations increases at the bar. Regarding the food, the chicharrones are a must try - you may want to bike, or walk here to work off the amazingly delicious and greasy calories (the parking is also limited)! The queso fundido con chorizo is also a super yummy dieters choice. The Brussels sprouts do not disappoint. Fav tacos are the pescado and the hongos! They also have great fresh salsas.",

Good: - drinks. great beer menu and really amazing cocktails - food is creative and we enjoyed the sushi order style of the tacos - the open concept is great - music was on point when we went  Bad: - it's a little awkward of a location due to being right off Indian School - due to the location being right across from a neighborhood, they have to close at 10pm due to noise ordinance which is a bit of a bummer, because everytime we've been here it's still pretty busy at 10pm and its a fun place to pitstop on the way home from a later dinner for the drinks  Overall, definitely a great place for happy hour or post-dinner drinks!",

Our fault. The menu was confusing, and no one explained it to us. No one knew who's food was who's and they mixed it all up as it came out sporadically. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY- The SERVICE was the WORST. All of the wait staff had attitudes and would roll their eyes at you if you asked for something. We didn't have napkins, waters, chips, or salsa until 45 minutes into our meal. After asking the extremely rude waiter for the manager, she looked over at our table laughed and walked away. I will NEVER EVER EVER RETURN. And you should not even try it. How this place has even managed decent reviews blows my mind. Go to Mi Patio or Taco Bell and save $200 and your blood pressure from anger while you're at it.",

My favorite tacos has to be the pork belly, carnitas, and the shrimp. Get those and you won't be disappointed. Also the bartender Juvier (I believe) is awesome. He's very informative and you can tell he likes his job. The guacamole and chips are good and so is the cheese dip, but you have to eat the cheese fast because it starts to harden. Overall this is my spot when I crave tacos.",

We ordered some chips with queso fundido to wash them down.  The chips were fresh and tasty, and the queso was sizzling and savory, but the quantity was hardly enough for five people.  Probably better suited to two, three at the most.  There is no salsa, no hot sauce and no condiments.  The fried Brussels Sprouts were enjoyed by the vegetarians, and they said it was okay.  Tacos are on the pricey side, nearing $4 for one tiny street taco.  We had the Queso a la Plancha, Pescado, Pollo Agave and Barbacoa.  Daughter said the la Plancha was pretty good.  Wife liked the Pescado.  I had Pollo Agave and Barbacoa.  The chicken in the Pollo Agave was a fist of deep fried chicken fat.  Nice crispy breading, but the fattiness combined with the sweet of Agave was off-putting.  The menu described a chimichurri, but all I could taste was sugar.  The Barbacoa was again a golfball-sized hunk of meat.  It was mildly flavored and okay.  I think it would have been better if the meat were shredded a bit more.  All in all, nine tacos, two appetizers, two rounds of drinks came in at nearly $200 with a tip.  The tacos were just okay.  The drinks were just okay.  I\"m not sure I'd be interested in going back, it just doesn't dazzle enough for me.",

I had to dive in prior to getting photo or video evidence, sorry. Accompanying that was a delicious Bloody Maria, with the perfect amount of spice. We then ordered an array of tacos, ranging from carne asada, chicken chimichuri, breakfast tacos, to fish tacos. Based on my testing, you cannot order a bad taco here. My favorite was the chicken taco, the fried chicken on it was to die for. Tried the Serrano margarita too which was awesome. Service was very good, everyone was very helpful. We will be back!",

    "text": "Excited for another addition to Arcadia area & within walking distance of my work. Energetic & friendly staff with yummy food!!  The chefs & management are truly passionate about their food here!!!  And my drink was smooth & strong!  I sat at the kitchen counter to watch the action & passion of the chefs in their preparation of their food!  They were definitely having fun & enjoyed cooking up fabulous tasting food!!  They really do just make your chips when you order them.   Vince, my server (aka 'Napkin Ninja'), was exceptionally attentive with my napkins & drinks as the tacos were overfilling with messy deliciousness (at least with me & finger licking good lol).   The Queso was 'light' tasting not heavy. I think it was the flaming TEQUILA cooked with it that makes it very tasty mmmmmmmmmmm!!  The Brussels sprouts were fabulous without the sauce but other people love drenching it in the guajillo honey mayo.   All the meats on each of the tacos were tender but I was especially impressed with the lamb & the lengua (usually don't care for it but glad I tried it cause it just melted in your mouth).  For great lighter taste: the Cachete de Res & Asada. For richer, creamier taste: Cordero & Lengua (for someone who usually doesn't eat sour cream or avocado -the blends were delicious).  There are more to try mmmmmm.   Vegan lovers will love how the chefs have taken special care & preparations to make sure it will not be cooked or have touched any meat products.   Happy Hour will be Monday (all day) & Tuesday thru Sunday 3-6pm with a special menu.   What I've tried so far with full descriptions (all gone in my very happy mouth & tummy)-  Queso Fundido al Tequila: melted Monterey Jack cheese, tomato, onion, TEQUILA & served with just made chips.   Repollo Tiernos (little cabbages): fried Brussel sprouts, lime, spicy pinche seasoning, cotija with guajillo honey mayo.   Cachete de res: braised beef cheek, cabbage, cilantro & grapefruit salad w/ creamy avocado & tomatillo salsa.   Cordero: braised lamb shank, esquite, queso fresco, cilantro.   Asada: citrus marinated skirt steak, avocado, diced onion, cilantro & cotija cheese.   Lengua: triple cooked Colorado beef tongue, avocado, diced onion & cilantro w/ roasted tomatillo salsa & guajillo honey mayo.",

    "text": "I would give them a 4 for the food and margaritas because they are both very good. I gave them a 2 because although you get a smile from the server, the timing and process is severely broken for the last 2 weeks in a row. Actually, it's been the same for almost all of our 10 or so visits. I won't drag this review out and just try to give you the bullet points.   - Food to our table delivered at various times, not all together.  The \"polite wait\" till everyone got their food just made it all cold, so some were done eating while others had t even started. - 1 hr and 15 min for a kids quesadilla, which wasn't good. I get it it's not a kids place, but little kids don't enjoy corn and funky cheese, so don't offer it. - We arrived for happy hour and I ordered a happy hour slider before 6 and received it at 7 - no exaggeration. They even forgot part of the appetizer. See the picture for yourself. No meat. No Au jus. And then I had to ask for Au jus twice and you'll laugh at what I got. Don't bring it if it's not right!! - The restaurant was only 20-25% full, but I had to get up and order my drinks at the bar myself. - After waiting nearly an hour and 25 minutes for parts of our food order, the waitress came back and asked what tacos we were missing. No apology either. It's one hour and 25 minutes later and I'm sorry, this is not City Hall.  There are 5 tables here!  My suggestion, if the Vig tells you it's a an hour wait, stay there and wait!  Like I said at the beginning of this review, the food is actually good, but you just can't get it to your mouth.  If they can figure out the service and timing, the place will be great. If not, I give it 4 months, but I hope I'm wrong.",

The building is beautiful with barn woods and metal details, but most seating is high top tables (both inside and on the patio) and the barstools are small in diameter, hard wood and very uncomfortable - particularly for those with junk in our trunk! The tacos had ample filling and were well executed but for $4 per taco I felt the value for money was low. We got carne asada (which had overpowering lime flavor), carnitas (was good), barbacoa (my favorite), fish (very under seasoned) and quesp de plancha ( the surprising winner of the night). After 8 tacos, 2 drinks and chips with guacamole we spent over $60. For that price I would have expected better finishing touches like super comfy surroundings, excellent service and freebies at the table like chips and salsa to start. This place is trying to be two different things - both the local hangout and a super trendy \"sushi-esque\" hip place. Not sure if we will be back...",

Amy group of 7 walked in and the first thing that was said to us by our waiter when we sat down was \"Just an FYI, we don't split checks it's policy so yeah.\" Not even a hello, how has your day been was said to us before that. Also, the policy is annoying but not something that we would be upset about if told in a kinder manner. Our group then proceeded to order. The ordering process is very odd and not very smart. You mark how many tacos you want on the menu with a dry erase marker.I saw many orders messed up because it is so easy to erase what one put down. We ordered about 15 tacos and out of those 15, SEVEN never came out. And they also brought out two tacos that we never even ordered AND tried to charge us for them even though we sent them back. Also ordered two margaritas and they were never brought out. Needless to say we won't be returning.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying the food and drinks were good, especially the chicken chicharones. However, if you are with a large group make sure everyone has cash or one person is willing to pick up the tab. If you are at a table they DO NOT do separate checks. My friends and I found that out the hard way. Our waitress had to run the check 6 times because some had cash and some their cards. It was our first time there and that should have been told to us immediately. I would be willing to go back but they need to change that policy.",

    "text": "Nice spot for happy hour. Cool art on the walls. The tall tables in the bar area are great for a group and I'm so glad they didn't have the enormous TV's above the bar turned on. The place has such good energy, I'd hate to see that destroyed by some brainless television programming.  The pinche paloma- tequila/grapefruit juice/lime/agave/squirt- is fab- not too sweet, not too sour, love the salted rim! It's an awesome deal during HH ($4) but good enough to order during regular hours ($9).   Fried cabbages- maybe not healthy, but SO good. I love a crispy sprout and these are nicely sprinkled with cotija- not just on top, but all the way through the bowl. The dipping sauce was really tasty, but these bite size veggies were fine on their own, too. $4 for a large serving- definitely recommend.  Queso la plancha taco ($3.25)- Not bad- griddled cotija cheese was good, topped with a bit of guac and a tomatillo salsa that was heavy on the lime. The double wrapped corn tortillas were good, but could've used a minute or two on the grill. Would have been better with a bit of hot sauce.  Overall, good place for HH. The menu is small, but what's on it is good and reasonably priced. Warning- they don't split checks. This is annoying if you are with a group and something I hope they reconsider even if it means adding automatic gratuity for a large table. I despise that moment when you have to figure out who ordered what to split a bill with a group. So much easier if the server does it for us. It's annoying to do and I always worry that the server gets stiffed because someone doesn't pay as much as they should. Would return, but probably not with a group.",

There is an area with 4 tops and another area with larger party tables although you can sit anywhere you like. The bar is dual facing, so you can look out or in. I've been there twice for happy hour. Their HH drink menu is a splendid deal and there are plenty of cocktail options. I loved the Paloma Pinche as well as their margarita. Both hit that sweet spot of not too sour, not too sweet. They are not shy with the alcohol! We only had the shrimp slider on the HH menu. Two pieces of fried shrimp in a sweet sauce on challa roll. Best non burger slider I've ever had. Their taco menu is extensive. There are so many options and even several vegetarian AND vegan items. They are street tacos so their small but the chefs pack in the flavors with sauces, cheeses, and spices to make each taco we had delicious. We tried all the fish and veggie tacos and were not disappointed with ANY of them. Roughly 3-4 bucks per taco. Service at the bar was on point, always checking on us but not overbearing.",

Working in the industry I like to see if it's just my table or the rest of the restaurant enjoying their experience. Timing of the food was great. We had 6 ppl ordering 3-5 tacos each. That's close to 25 tacos made from scratch. You could tell nothing sat in a warmer. Appetizers were served really fast. I'll wait a little longer for a fresh made product. Handcrafted drinks just another bonus about this place",

    "text": "Tacos Tequila Whiskey has been in my bookmarks for a while now and I finally had the chance to check it out tonight. With so much anticipation perhaps I set my expectations too high but was unfortunately let down.   I was with a party of 8 and when we arrived we were seated promptly. I was a little surprised they were able to accommodate the lager group.   We ordered drinks and started looking over the menu. From this point forward it was all downhill.  The waitress came over and told us that she can't split checks. It kinda sucks she says but it's just the way they do it.  I mean come on you can't split checks?   The ordering process was really cumbersome and what I think extremely inefficient. You order sushi style where everyone marks tick marks next to the taco they want and tallies it up. The sharpies she gave us did not work. I ended up getting up and grabbing sharpies myself. We went through 4 by the time it worked. When the food came out it was all on one plate and the waitress has to tell you what each taco is and you grab off that plate. The table next to us was really confused and had forgotten what they ordered and she had to go over it one by one. Like I said seems ineffective and that the restaurant may benefit from a traditional way of taking orders so there is no confusion.   The food ....... here is where they redeemed themselves. The tacos are actually really good. Lots of different flavors and juices. The meat is tender and perfectly cooked. I really enjoyed the catchete. The tacos were so good they basically melted in my mouth.   This place is far from my house so unless in the area I likely won't go back. I will end with this:  Food:  excellent.  Service & ordering: mediocre.",

The manager was so nice and apologetic for the wait that she immediately let us know it was on the house. We really appreciated her caring about our experience that much.

Last Friday , a group of neighborhood family's decided to go out for our typical Friday night outing. We typically go to our standard spot, LGO, but we decided on checking out the new spot in the neighborhood. A group of 6 adults and 6 kids showed up to TTW at 5:30 pm (fairly early for a Friday night) and the hostess gave us the sign that we had no chance of getting a table outside and especially with KIDS.   ----We ended up leaving and heading to the Vig which was more then happy to accommodate our group with KIDS at an outside table by the bocce ball court.----  Flash forward to 6-7-17, my wife, mother in-law and 2 kids , ages 1 and 3, decided to give Tacos, Tequila , and Whiskey another chance since it was a smaller group . We had a great meal and drinks, the server was very friendly and sweet to our kids .   Approximately, an hour into dinner our kids decided to run around outside, and yes, we were sitting outside . They are typical toddlers, running around playing with their cars and being silly . And admittedly, walking on the perimeter bench seating .   The manager walked outside and approached our table and said \" Excuse me , could you pick up your child from the floor (who was playing with Lightning McQueen car) and stop having your kids destroy our restaurant. Excuse me\" I replied, my kids are just being kids. He continued to lecture me that my children were a \"hazard\" to the staff and other patrons . My guess is that the manager, that will remain unnamed (who handed me his business card) does not appreciate kids at the restaurant.   And a few more rude comments were exchanged from him and a few from me.   I can promise you that my kids and the 4 others neighborhood kids, from last weekend at The Vig, were acting in the same manner with no problem from the restaurant.  Running around and being silly .   Bottom line .... the restaurant is NOT KID friendly and families please spend your money at LGO, the VIG , or MOD Pizza because this establishment is and ANTI Family Arcadia restaurant.",

It does seem more expensive at first, but it's not that much more honestly.  I was thinking it had to be overrated, but it's not!   I recommend ordering the chips.  You get to pick 3 Salsas with it!  The parking is ample as well.  Well thought restaurant! Good job!",

But the point that really got to me was when rap music was playing overhead and the N-word kept coming up over and over again in various songs! Being an African-American it's hard for me to except that a place with play music like that that use the N-word. It was completely unacceptable and inappropriate. I also found that the food was way too expensive for what you would normally pay for tacos. I will not be going back! #HighlyOffended",

We wandered in Sunday evening and sat at the bar. Nice cocktail list and some good craft beers on tap. The bar staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. We had a good time dining there.  The food was outstanding. Their street taco menu is kind of sushi style, as they say. The tacos are al a carte and there are starters as well. We had the brussel sprouts (awesome, with a great dipping sauce). Every taco we had was incredible. We had the pork belly, lamb, beef tongue, beef cheek, and carnitas. (Don't worry, they have classics as well if you're not quite as adventurous).   The atmosphere was great. They had a big outdoor dining area and bar in addition to tables inside. Great food and a really fun environment. Highly recommended. They're still working out the bar menu but it will include tequila and whiskey flights in addition to their cocktails, beers, etc.",

The slider was really good and the cocktails were average.  The atmosphere is really cool with the open garage doors as well. If it was just based on the food and atmosphere, I would give a 4 star.  BUT...  If their management doesn't fix some things, I don't think this place will last given the amount of competition in the area as well as the demographic.  We were there around 4:30 on a Saturday and they had 4-5 employees on their day-off in there drinking at the bar top (typically not allowed at good bars). Anyway, it wouldn't have been a big deal, except ALL Focus was on them. All 3 bartenders were more interested in talking with their friends/employees at the bar. The manager even went over and hung out with them for quite some time. All this going on while the rest of the patrons were ignored. Because of this, it gave off more of a young/Old Town Scottsdale feel which I don't think will take off in the location.   On our way out, we heard a group of college kids say, \"Never going back there.\"  I'm not against going back, but since there is great Mexican food and 50 other cool bars/restaurants in the area, I definitely won't be recommending it nor will I be back any time soon. The employees were VERY comfortable given the fact that they just opened.",

First of all the music wasn't that loud but our waitress was very soft spoken with a side pony tail (your hair will easily and literally fall in food). She spent more time gossiping and chatting with coworkers then our \"MEAL\". I have never been here before, too. I love salsa, haven't tried theirs. Sometimes you wanna try/sample what you like. That way you know next time (which there won't be after my full experience). Obviously, I wanted to sample the salsa with chips, got no chips lol (8spoons). Same with the tacos I'll try a vegetarian, chicken, and steak. Now by all means I've worked in high end restaurants when I lived in California. I'm glad to state the vegetarian taco \"supposedly\" cooked perfect/ no cross contamination ( I can't be 100% as I'm not one). Then my chicken and steak taco came. Took 2 bites of the steak, opened it up and looked what was in it. First of all the steak wasn't even cooked it was cool temp with raw red coloring. Chicken looked like dog food, took one bite of it, and that was enough. Wouldn't a normal waitress asked what was wrong??????? She didn't even ask what was wrong etc. She took the plate and left. I wasn't looking for it to be comped but, when have a job you should care about the feedback from your customers. There is better tacos than this place.",

The drinks were on point, I ordered the Michelada that had just the right amount of spice. We ordered the guacamole and chips and a variety of six different tacos. Each one of them was excellent! Carefully prepared and not only visually appealing, but so flavorful and authentic. My favorite was the carnitas & barbacoa. The slaw they add to the taco is so good. They definitely have a unique spin on a traditional taco. I'm glad I gave them another chance as we live nearby and love having a neighbor gem close by. Keep it up, TTW!",

So the first time I came here was more post-HH on a Friday (like 8ish), and even though the place seemed nice & all I got a club-y Scottsdale vibe from it. I don't know why that is really, because when I came for HH on Saturday (like 4ish) it wasn't that way at all. It was much more laid back. There's a real nice patio and a long wrap around bar that's kind of on the patio on one side and inside on the other. This is where I sat with my friend for a couple drinks and nachos.   We each had a couple of \"Pinche Palomas.\" They were a little sweet (which is what I'd expect from an HH cocktail), but tasty & refreshing. The nachos were a good sized portion for HH and they were good, but could have used a little more \"stuff\" (crema, pico, etc...). Again, this was HH so I can't complain since they were like 6 bucks for quite a bit of food.  I really like that Tacos Tequila Whiskey does HH EVERY DAY. Both our bartenders were friendly.

    "text": "I was just introduced to Tacos Tequila Whiskey yesterday. This little spot is a great find. Great variety of street tacos. The Bloody Maria is.... damn! And, get this: though October on weekends we were surprised to learn that Mimosas, Bloody Mary's and Bloody Maria's were just 1. Sweet.   The restaurant resides in a repurposed service station, complete with garage door over the bar area and barn doors on one side which opens up the patio area even more when the weather is nicer. My only minor quibble is the less than comfortable yellow metal stools at the bar and high tops. Other than that, this is a place I'll be returning to regularly.  Service was on point, friendly and helpful with the menu. Ordering is a little different, done what I'd call sushi-style wherein you tick off your selections with a marker on the menu and wait for the goodness that are the tacos to hit your table.   I'm a fan of another taco establishment on Central that is also pretty damned good, but I'll have say the fare at Tacos Tequila Whiskey takes street tacos up a considerable notch.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try.",

I've been too many taco joints and these kick ass! Through October on weekends from 11pm to 3pm Bloody Mary's, Maria's and Mimosas are only one penny!  The staff here are cordial and very efficient. They just opened in May and the establishment is immaculate.  Come out and support this new comer. They are well worth supporting and making a staple in the community. I wish them all the luck and Twyla and I will be by often to lend our support!  #Vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate #irishcatv2",

    "text": "First time I came with coworkers for a company outing with about 8 people. When I talked this place up to my brother we came back for a second time as just us two and had a totally different experience.   I think the first time went well because my boss just ordered everything at once and we passed apps and tacos around the table so we didn't really know what we were eating/drinking or even how much it cost. I think they also were very attentive because we were ordering a lot of drinks and food and the bar was practically empty.   The second time we went we looked at the menus and were very perplexed. A taco place with not one Mexican beer on draft? Majority of the draft handles were IPAs or heavier beers... for an Arizona bar they should know that they would make more money selling lighter beers in this heat (or at least this time of year)! Anyways I opted for a margarita off the menu but the bartender talked me into their special after I was asking about happy hour and typically that means the drink would be discounted or cheaper. Turns out this \"special\" was a $10 cucumber mojito with tequila. It was alright but the drink I originally wanted was a few bucks cheaper and the only reason I opted for the special is because she made it sound like it was a lower price.  As for the menu, that's when I realized this was a Colorado bar. It's nice because there are a lot of veggie options (whatever the taco with mushrooms was called was good), but there aren't a lot of basics. I literally had to read the description of every taco to figure out what I wanted. Normally I'd order 3 or 4 Street tacos since they are small but I just couldn't remember what was in each one so I only ended up ordering 2. When we asked for spicy salsa, they brought out a few different bowls of... things? Definitely not the salsa we're used to in AZ. One was like an onion lemon soup and the other like a spicy aioli. I just wanted a hot salsa that would go with any taco but these sauces just didn't blend well unless your palette was looking for a very specific flavor. I do have to say that the fried brussel sprouts are the absolute best thing I've eaten there.  To put it simply, I think they are being a little too creative and missing some of the basics. I can appreciate a bar like this every once and a while but we were looking for a new taco place to go to on the regular and this one isn't gonna be it. Hopefully they make some adjustments to feed to this new Arizona market!",

    "text": "Our group went to this new spot in Arcadia on a Saturday night at 7:30pm. Being a party of six we were sat right away. The table was small for the plates, water glasses, chips and salsa. Venue itself is either actually or made to look like a repurposed garage complete with a glass/steel garage door. Being winter in Phoenix all doors and windows were open, made the restaurant feel like we were outside actually.  Server had an attitude on several accounts when we inquired about some missing food and drink orders but tried to make it up with politeness. I think she was flustered and busy with other tables but it was apparent she had a short fuse on a few interactions.   The Older Fashions and margaritas were very good, interesting twist on the classics. All the tacos were very good. They are small street sized but it hurts to pay $4+ per taco. They come out in a haphazard way, bunch of tacos on a plate and your table picks out who's is whose. This is part of the problem with confusing what orders we were missing.",

We chose to sit at the bar where Javier took good care of us.  We stayed with the HH Cocktails and Beer. I had the Pinche Paloma. We ordered the HH Slider Combo (fried shrimp slider, MX roast beef slider and a chorizo sloppy joe slider). We also ordered off the regular menu the Guacamole and 2 of the daily special taco offering which was a Short Rib Taco.  My HH cocktail was fantastic. The HH Slider Combo was very good along with the Short Ribs Tacos. The Guacamole was very OK, nothing special but the chips it came with were really good. We asked for some heat (sliced serranos) which we were charged for at the end ( 50 cents). When we got the bill to be honest the cost of the Taco were very pricey $6 each, WOW street taco sticker shock!  Atmosphere trendy (open loft feel), Service from Javier the bar tender fantastic, Food good but very pricey. I'll be back but only for Happy Hour items.",

    "text": "Anyone who knows me knows how much I love tacos. So when I saw that there was a new taco joint opening up that was a quick bike ride away, I knew I had to get there ASAP to test out all the taco glory.  Luckily for me, Tacos Tequila Whiskey was delicious and can now be a part of my weekly taco rotation.  Two of the standouts we had were the beef cheek tacos and the lengua taco.  I'm normally not the biggest lengua fan, however the meat really melted in your mouth, so it had more of a brisket type quality when you bit into it, which I loved.  Also, if you go, please do not miss out on the churros!!  The churros con chocolate (made with Abuelita chocolate - which is a cinnamon sugar type of chocolate) were absolutely outstanding.  Hands down the best churros I've eaten in the Valley.  So good in fact, that we came back here for a 2nd time over the weekend so I could get a second helping of it ;)  And considering that this restaurant just opened this weekend, I have to say that our service was outstanding!  We sat in Mary's section, and she was really friendly, knowledgeable, and had great food and drink recommendation (try the Gin N Mousse - it's a prickly pear gin and mezcal drink; to die for!).  I highly recommend sitting in her section; she made the experience even more fun.  A+++ for Tacos Tequila Whiskey!!  I'll definitely be back soon!!",

I asked for Southern Comfort Old Fashion, the bartender was kind enough to bring me into the year 2017. \"Um- we don't even carry Southern Comfort\" he politely said quietly.   I was a little confused by the selections of that kind of drink but he suggested a Tequila Old Fashion, he said it was very good. So I went for it. EXCELLENT! It kind of reminded me of a Scotch Old Fashion. Very yummy.   The bartender offered a touch of the tequila in a glass as a sample and showed me the brand they use. He told me how the tequila was aged in whiskey barrels, and that, that's what gave it a smoky flavor.   My partner and I ordered chips and salsa. We got hot and mild all were very good with lots of flavor.  We also ordered 4 tacos of various flavors, they were really good too.  Overall I like this new place very much, would give 5 Stars, but I'm not sure I can afford to keep going there. The final bill for 4 drinks, chips & salsa and 4 tacos was $77.68 with tip  Yikes. I actually wish I could have tipped more appropriately but I did what I could.  Can you guys add a happy Hour to your menu? Price is what's keeping me from coming back more.",

While waiting for our guests, I headed to the bar to try one of the signature cocktails, and  DH waited by the kitchen.  The very friendly manager came over to chat him up, and make food and drink suggestions, while I got drink suggestions from one of three bartenders who approached me at the busy bar.  I chose the Serrano Marg, a good choice, a spicy sipping drink.    The outdoor sitting area was surprisingly busy for an 100+ degree day, and we headed out to sit at one of the padded perimeter benches.  The hostess came to find us when our table was ready, we ordered the guacamole and chips, which arrived right when our friends walked in.  One fundido, eight tacos, two Palomas, and a few beers later, we were delightfully satiated.  The tacos all come on one plate, which would be okay, if they were marked in some way.  I ordered the Barcona (?) and the fish tacos; both delicious.  Service was excellent, at every step of the experience.  Our one complaint, and it's a big one, the music was SO loud that we could not hear each other, or our server. 15 hours later, my ears are still throbbing.   I'm wondering if that's why the orders are \"sushi style\"  with a list to check off.   There's that fine line between energetic and ouch, that other local restaurants like Chelsea's and Doughbird have figured out.  Turn the music down a bit, and this joint is perfect.",

This should be a restaurant to watch as with a lot of tuning it could be a good place to grab a somewhat upscale taco.   Traditionalists will likely still prefer some place like Maria's as it hits the comfort food niche better but meat lovers will find a lot to love as will people looking for more adventurous and varied offerings.",

Three of four plates eventually came to the table but not all at once; in piecemeal fashion. As I waited for my food order to come, my family ate their food. After a while, I finally asked the waitress where was my food. She did not know and I told her that i was not happy and would like a word with the manager. When he arrived I told him I was not happy that i had to wait so long for the food and that he should know about it. He barely acknowledge my feelings and never said that he was sorry for the inconvenience, then he left with no apology. The food arrived shortly thereafter. It was quite irritating to all of us his total lack of caring and insensitivity that we were upset. All he needed  say something civil like, \"Sir, I apologize for the problem. Will get on it. What can I do to make things right for you?\" I went up to him when we left and said, \"I'm not happy with the way we were treated today.\" He looked at me with indifference and said to me.... \"I know, Have a nice day\". That was IT!",

BUT , this funky taco joint is my favorite-and my son's also! They're reasonably priced, and you can order different varieties-so many to choose from! We usually order a round of little tacos, they serve them on a large platter so we can share them. They're pretty authentic, with a little modern twist, and they're not at all greasy and gross. My favorite is the vegetarian taco. It's so flavorful! If you want a little taste of Mexico (and very close to my mama's cooking-minus the modern part!) this is the place to go. I've not had any adult beverages there yet, but it does have a pretty happening happy hour, a very cool outside patio area, and the decor is funky, Mexican inspired, and modern. Definitely recommend.",

We were put on the wait list, which is no big deal considering it's opening day. About ten minutes later, the hostess let us know that they are clearing off a table for us. Unfortunately, a group from the bar decided to swoop in and have dinner at this table instead of the bar (they chose not to be on the wait list). The staff was irritated enough to talk amongst themselves, and with us about the situation, but did nothing about it. So we waited another 15 minutes before saying forget it and going to OHSO for dinner.",

We ordered the guacamole first, which tasted like plain avocado, no flavor and zero spice. We asked for some salsa to possibly add a little flavor to it- our server responded with, \"it's probably going to take a while\". Call me crazy, but I think that a request for salsa should be pretty common in a place that serves tacos?!  Empty on chips, water and still no food. Then we get our salsa as we continue to wait for 40 minutes... We then got ONE chicken taco, which was cold and the server said it's because it has kale and pico de gallo in it?! That was it. No offer to another option.  We are watching the entire staff run around looking so unorganized and frantic. All the servers are standing by the kitchen waiting and the kitchen staff- they make Chipotle look like a Michelin-starred restaurant compared to the mess we watched. Our server avoided us, no food, no water... We gave up and asked for our bill. She dropped it off with zero sympathy and ''said sorry for the wait''.  Will not be back and based on the service we had, they aren't worried about it.",

I don't think it's fair that other people pay for others, if they're not eating/drinking equally. She stated she couldn't and that everyone has to just equally pay. I was perturbed but let it go. Overall, great location, ambiance is fun. Server(s) were attentive otherwise. I overheard my friend tell our server that they should have stated upon arrival about the check situation. Obviously upset, the server said \"I'll just split your check\" to make her happy.  Being that we both worked in the food & beverage industry, don't we all know, as servers, you try your best to be cordial w/out being snappy or challenge a customer?  Still, I really enjoyed the trio of sliders, the nachos and queso dip, all on the happy hour menu.  Despite portions not being generous, it was all very tasty.",

They were very tasty, but very much on the tiny side. We also got the Brussels Sprouts ($4). They were extremely tasty with The aioli sauce! We were a bit disappointed that only one beer was on the happy hour menu. We had the Pinche Pomelo cocktail and it was really good. It would be nice to see a few less expensive drinks during happy hour. Was happy they were upfront with us when we asked the meaning of \"pinche\" (which we had already looked up).

Oh, get the guava fried chicken taco, it is amazing!",

We sat on the patio to catch the games and had no issues due to the perfect weather. The servers continue to not disappoint so we'll definitely be back!",

The place wasn't even busy and we saw the servers standing around chatting half the time when our drinks were empty and we wanted to order things.  The slider combos took 40 minutes to arrive.  40!  At like 5:30 on a Monday with not even half the restaurant full. Server just didn't care about us.  The sliders weren't up to par either. The sloppy Jose was completely dry. No sauce at all.  In Denver it's this gooey delicious messy goodness. This one has shriveled up dry chorizo. So weird. The other two sliders - beef and shrimp - were fine.  The pork belly taco and carnitas taco were delicious.  Too bad they can't get better staff. We were especially disappointed because we brought friends here and told them how amazing the place is back in Denver.  We set high expectations and our friends now think we don't know anything about good restaurants!",

Was told we couldn't get water because the cups were hot, when the food came it was all over the place, and I just flat didn't get my food. So, once everyone I was with finished eating, I said \"since everyone I'm with is done eating just go ahead and cancel mine.\" I was met with \"the new food runner gave it away.\"   Well, if you knew that then maybe you should've asked someone to re-make it? Maybe told me that's what was happening. Needless to say, our Tuesday meetup will be moved to a new spot going forward.",

I was thrilled to see this restaurant because the one in Denver is always busy and one of my favorites to boot!  Several of the tacos on the menu if not all, were the exact same and the restaurant was not crowded or too busy. It was like a taste of home. They have wonderful homemade alcoholic sodas on happy hour and a margarita that tops all margaritas in my opinion.  Arizona does not have a lot of the same Mexican food as Denver, so I think that people in Phoenix have a real gem.",

I loved the atmosphere and decor, it's a really open and colorful restaurant, and I really liked our waitress.   To start we ordered beer and the Queso Fundido con Chorizo, which was one of my favorite quesos that I've had (and we order a lot of queso). It was still sizzling for like a minute after they dropped it off at our table, and the flavor was amazing - I love that they just use pepperjack cheese, and lots of it :)   For an entree, we ordered tacos from the main menu which was \"sushi style,\" so we got to choose from a bunch of tacos. We tried 5 different ones, and they all came on a big platter for us to share from. We had the Pescado, Asada, Barbacoa, Pollo Agave, and Pollo Molcajete, and each was super tasty! I don't have complaints about a single one (well the piece of fried chicken on the Pollo Agave was really small, but it tasted amazing so that's okay). Each of the others had a great amount of meat, were cooked and seasoned well, and paired with great toppings!   I do wish they had tacos on the happy hour menu, but that definitely won't keep me from coming again!",

    "text": "Tacos Tequila Whiskey is an award winning Denver Based restaurant group with one location in Phoenix. They feature breakfast tacos, street sized non-traditional tacos and small batch Tequila and Whiskey based Drinks. They also are a Top 50 Best New Restaurants in the Country according to Bon Appetit Magizine.  This is a small full service restaurant with a dog friendly patio. From the entrance it's easy to pass by because they lack a large sign and it looks sort of like a garage. Inside it also looks like you order at a counter but then you see there is no counter so you seat yourself. You order using a dry erase marker. It is suggested that you might want 3-5 tacos depending on your appetite.  We started out by sharing the Watermelon and Arugula Salad. This was my favorite plate of what I tried. The salad was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS...I loved this salad.  I feel very mixed about the tacos. Some were better than others. I LOVED the Mushroom Taco I tried at Tacolandia. It was among the BEST I tried at that festival. The BEST ONE I tried today was the Beer Battered Fish Taco. I received a double shelled over stuffed taco. It was very difficult to eat. The small size tortillas just can't wrap around the fillings and it was like King Kong trying to squeeze into a Barbie Dress.....It just couldn't be done but the taco was delicious and tasty. The batter had a great flavor and the fish was mild and meaty. The Fish Taco was most successful and delicious of the tacos I tried today.  My least favorite Taco was the Pollio Agave. This taco had great potential because the chicken was tender and good with a super great crust. But this taco was all sweet....and the chimichurri didn't have enough punch to round things out. What made it even less successful was that all the agave soaked into the tortillas making them mushy and wet. It made them even seem raw.  My husband tried all the tacos. He enjoyed the Pork Belly the most...and maybe the Fish taco next.  Service was friendly and various workers checked on us.  Three stars is overall a positive review on Yelp (3 stars = A-OK) I just have some reservations.",

    "text": "***I started this review on 9-23-17  & completely forgot to finish!** We made our first trip during Arizona Restaurant Week in Sept.  Special menu featured  one cocktail each, one shared appetizer, 3  tacos each , and one shared dessert.  This is the best way to sample a new restaurant, in my opinion.  We started off with Totopos y Tres Salsas (trio salsas) with homemade chips.  Chips had just the right amount of crunch & salt.  We chose the casera,  molcajete, and the yessina abuela.  The mildest had a smokey flavor.  The other two (vinegar based, one had radishes & carrots the other had onions) were more my boyfriend's style.   For his tacos he chose the Pork Belly Agridulche (pork belly, candied garlic, cabbage & cilantro), Hongos (grilled mushrooms, cotija cheese, creamed cilantro corn & ancho chile crema) and the Queso a la plancha (grilled cotija cheese, avocado & roasted tomatillo salsa).  I wasn't as daring as I chose two Asada (skirt steak, avocado, onion, cilantro & cotija) and the Camaron a al Parilla (chile rubbed grilled shrimp, pico de gallo, arugula, avocado, tomatillo salsa & queso fresco).   All were delicious.  Thankfully we had enough room for dessert - house made churros with Mexican hot choc. dipping sauce.   We left full but not stuffed.    Servers were super friendly & helpful.  Loved the openness of the dining area - made you feel as if you were seated outside.   We will be back.",

    "text": "Always looking for value in meals and the $4-$5 street tacos world really never fall into that category. You always need at least 4 to kinda eek out a dinner and at that point, your at $20 if you throw in rice and beans. Even on taco Tuesday when only half of the tacos cost $2.50 each, it still feels like your getting taken to the cleaners whether your in Arcadia or not.     The tacos have some weird ingredients as well with everyone's favorite Kale salad appearing on a few tortillas. My choices were like a small snack. Both of my tacos had griddled cojita cheese, but one just had avocado and the other (not discounted), which was better, had cream corn, poblano peppers and crema. Two bites and your done wondering if you should fork off four more bucks to get you half-full. Anyway, Joe the manager and the staff are all nice, but they can't do much about prices under that heavy weighted corporate umbrella.",

It's over priced, and the hostess spilled sauce all over us, and did not even have the decently to apologize. We will be taking our business to other options, and will never come back. Go to Blanco or any other Fox concept, the food, ambiance and service will blow you away.",

It seemed like other tables where just like us, looking around and wondering why their server wasn't actually serving them, but instead playing with a puppy. On a positive the bartender was extremely helpful, got us water and cleared our plates when he saw our server wasn't being attentive.",

How about Instead of Taco's tequila whiskey maybe tequila and whiskey shot flavored tacos? Also the manager looked like he had one too many drinks. I suppose he might be the mastermind behind these amazing concoctions.  I will give them a gold star for trying though.

    "text": "I have very split experience about this place...  Experience #1: Take-out on our moving day... I was drawn to the plaza by a new coffee shop next door, and decided to pick up a few tacos for lunch.  Tacos were nicely packaged and clearly labeled; the girl who helped me was very knowledgeable about the menu and made a few recs. Tacos were pretty tasty (even after being dragged to my home for about 15 minutes), so I made a mental note to come back for another lunch and eat in - it's gotta to be even better, right?  Experience #2: Late lunch eat-in... it's a good thing this was not my first experience; this place would have ended up with a few less stars. Our server was not helpful at all... We ordered iced tea - sorry, lunch is a bit early to indulge in their very tempting cocktail menu (another mental note to come back for a happy hour). We also managed to fish out our waiter and order tacos, had a few questions again and he couldn't answer them... The menu is not that big, I would expect some more information. So we ordered two tacos each... I went next door to fetch a cup of iced coffee, and when I came back, to my surprise - waters and iced tea still wasn't there... in about 10 minutes more he stopped by to let us know that iced tea was still brewing and offered some waters. The tacos arrived shortly - the taste was still great, but at this point we were quite unhappy about the service... Took a some more time to get some forks... and we asked for a check, since we needed to move on with our day.  At this point of time he apologized and informed us that iced tea was still not ready and offered to take it off the bill. So service is very so-so and the place is not run greatly.  But... the tacos are very good! My favorite was shrimp taco and their brunch tacos (yeah, you read this right!) are pretty great.   Till next time... when (or if) we stop by for happy hour!",

    "text": "Tacos Tequila Whiskey (no commas) once boasted on their website that they are/were ranked as being one of the \"21 Best Mexican Restaurants in America\" and \"10 Best Taco Spots in the US.\"  The source? A food blogger on the Huffington Post.   Well, okay then.  Anyway, I originally reviewed TTW after they first opened and decided to pay them a revisit to see if things have changed. This place currently offers up three locations in Denver. Strange as it may be, their Phoenix location is not listed. Perhaps in an effort to maintain their \"local\" cred with the Denver foodies? Who knows.  I have zero interest in tequila and whiskey, so I can only comment on the food. The tacos you'll find here are a combination of tradition and creativity, which can be both good and bad, depending on your preferences. Traditionalists will consider their asada to be standard, while their cube shaped pork belly is a bit odd to handle (see Otro Cafe for how to do it right). The best taco and most interesting taco I've tried is their queso a la plancha, proving that you don't necessarily need meat to make a taco good.  On another note, their guacamole is decent. Aside from a big hiccup with some burnt sprouts during our first visit that I chalked up to still being new, I think that most food you'll find here is good. Unfortunately, we already have plenty of places offering up a similar approach, sometimes operating on a much higher level. Because of this, TTW falls somewhere within the foggy three to four-star range for me. Other taco joints have kind of spoiled us in this regard.  As a neighborhood post-work/happy hour spot, TTW works well. But is it worth going out of your way to visit for a taco fix? This I'm not so sure about.  Nevertheless, I think they're worth checking out if you haven't done so already.",

We had the Barbacoa, chicken, carnitas tacos and each one has its own unique and awesome flavor.  I will also say they have had some staff turn over but on today's visit we sat at bar with Natalia and talk about service she is incredibly sweet, personable, professional and provided exceptional service.  If you haven't been in a while check it out you won't be disappointed. Ps Natalia makes a killer  Pinche Paloma !",

    "text": "What a great place to meet a friend on a Thursday for lunch! We met out on the covered patio. The breezy, unusually cool day made it ideal to sit there. My friend had already ordered a drink and chips and salsas at the bar, so we migrated over to a table to order our lunches. A waitress came to tend to us right away.  The chips were great as were the three dips. I'm not even sure which they were, but one with turnips was surprisingly good. I drank the Purist Margarita, and whoa was it tasty. Very refreshing, and definitely potent.  As the tacos are small, I ordered three: hongo (mushroom), lengua (tongue), and queso (cheese). Note that lengua and another taco are not listed on the online menu at this time, but were handwritten on the menu and also on a board near the bar. I enjoyed all three tacos, but I wouldn't get the queso one again because--if you look at the picture--the whole taco is essentially repeated beneath the mushroom taco and there you get a lot more deliciousness for a little more money. I loved that mushroom taco, too--the texture was savory and meaty, and I really felt like I was eating meat.   I ate at the Denver TTW back in 2014 and had a great visit there. This visit to the Arcadia location here in Phoenix reasserts that they make awesome tacos and I should eat there more often.",

It was refreshing, flavorful and the perfect balance of sweet and tart. On top of all of this it was also visually appealing which is always a nice plus.   I came here for a quick happy hour and fell in love with the vibes and the drinks. I am definitely a fan and I can't wait to go back again!",

Good not great. I recommend passing on the churro. The inside was very mushy not fluffy. Outside was crispy. Chocolate dip, pass. Caramel was good.   Venue: clean. Moderate amount of ppl. Not busy for a taco Tuesday. Half outside and inside.   Parking: small lot  Servive: poor. Forgot/didn't get a table member's order but he ate enough appetizer that he wasn't hungry anymore. At one point we were looking for any server and there was no server in the restaurant for more drinks. They then all came through the back like they had some meeting during dinner service? Friendly but not present.   Wouldn't highly recommend.",

Tacos Tequila Whisky has a corner with a bar that can open in and out. The ambiance is great... amazing art, high ceilings, great finishes.  And the tacos are cool! Yes, delicious. And creative. And you can catch them at reduced prices certain days and times (check with them for what those hours and days are... I know one to be Taco Tuesday).  The taco selection was large and looked amazing.  We ordered several different types, split them in two and they were all phenomenal. I recommend going with a buddy, ordered one of everything and splitting them so you can try them all! I will be back to try those that I missed.",

The guacamole was solid, a little simple and could have used more salt.   The tacos had a great selection of different meats and toppings. The au jous that comes with the pork belly, we put on EVERYTHING-delicious! Top favorites- fish n' beer and the shrimp!   My favorite part- CHURROS! After all of this food, how could you possibly be hungry?! Was ready to just about stick one in my ear at this point...but so glad we ordered and tried them! Half order is 3- they are melt-in-your-mouth cinnamon sugary!   The ambiance is great- awesome outdoor area to enjoy when it's cooler! The decor inside was simple, but clean, and festive!",

Things must have gone downhill recently because the quality of food has noticeably changed. I used to love the chicharonnes with the spicy dipping sauce but the last time I got them it was tiny little crumbles of burnt chicken and wasn't edible. The margarita I had was beyond sweet and tasted like a sour mix but they claim it's all fresh. Ehh I don't know about this place and the whiskey part of the name doesn't make any sense... they have a few bottles of whiskey on their shelf, nothing too impressive, but it isn't really featured at all.   The service is usually good, the people working are pretty friendly. It's also always slow and I don't think that's a good sign.   Oh, last thing.. The nachos don't come with much  meat at all so if you're planning on eating these order double meat (even though it's an up charge).",

Server brought a wine different from what we'd ordered and when questioned basically shrugged and said that they were changing their supplier. Wine selection is very limited.  Bottom line: Phoenix is full of homegrown places for  outstanding street tacos. This chain from Denver is not worth the bother.",

The queso fundido was odd. It came sizzling in a skillet but was essentially just melted shredded cheese. Huh? Queso fundido is normally some combo of cheese, cream cheese/heavy cream and maybe some tomato and jalapeno. It's like they threw a handful of shredded cheese in the skillet and tossed a few tomatoes and onions on top. It was DRIPPING with oil and coagulated to the point we had to saw at it with a fork to stick it to a chip.  The margarita was just okay.  Two of the tacos I had were decent and I enjoyed the melted cotija cheese on them. One was the fish and the other was either vegan or vegetarian (both of which I've thoroughly enjoyed at other restaurants...so yes.....they can be good). The avocado taco was bland.  Service was decent as well although our tacos took quite some time to come out.  All in all, I probably won't be back. Los Taquitos is just up the street",

    "text": "I write this with the idea that I will give this place hopefully another try. We went to Tacos Tequila Whisky this past Friday to try it out since we live in the area. They had the window open between the bar and restaurant which was a bit silly because it was over 100 degrees outside. I'm all for inside outside dining but people were visibly uncomfortable.   The service needs help. The lady they had bringing out the tacos seemed a bit disinterested in the whole thing. Our server was ok but there seemed to be a general lack of polish with their service.   The food was good. The queso was tasty and the chips were fresh. We had a selection of the tacos which were tasty and filling. There just seems to be something missing when you look at other taco places. I have to say my favorite Tacos are at CruJente. Much better Lengua.   I know they are trying to be cool but their food and service needs to step up a bit if they are going to survive in Arcadia.",

Do not bother considering this place if you have a group of people as there are so many better restaurants around town.",

Food was okay but the menu was super confusing (which no one explained) They brought out 3 different trays of the wrong food, took our plates away after having  chips and salsa and then never brought us another one. We asked for napkins and hot sauce, they never came. We asked for the manager, 30 minutes later she started to follow us out the door. The food is not worth the terrible service. Buyer beware of of the mass order of tacos they come out on one plate all at the same time with no explanation of what they are, we even went as far as writing our order on our napkin and still had no clue who's taco was who's.",

We went for Friday happy hour and sat at the bar, there were about 6 customers at this time and two bartenders; Redding (sp?) and Missy. Anytime we wanted anything we had to hail them down, which is frustrating especially with such a small number of customers. Missy was friendly enough but pretty engrossed in a personal conversation so hard to get her attention, but the guy...oy vey... We felt like we were putting him out by being there. He did not engage in any way, made no eye contact and other than telling us how to order he really didn't tell us much of anything. Disappointed we heading to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers which was absolutely packed and ended up sitting next to a guy who had just left the taco place for the same reason. If they get some bar help that has some energy and enthusiasm we'd likely try again but for now we'll stick with the Vig which we know will be fun. Food was great, no complaints.",

I've had much better and much cheaper at one the small Mexican food restaurants around town.  The drink menu is very limited and the cocktails were also just \"ok.\"  Went with friends for Happy Hour and as it got later and started to \"fill up\" one of the hostesses kept giving us the stink eye to leave, but we had not received our check from our waitress.  After the hostess was literally staring at us for about 15 minutes with venom in her eyes, we asked her \"could you get our waitress to give us our check and we will gladly leave.\"  So bottom line - food not good and staff just downright RUDE.  Do not recommend - try somewhere else",

    "text": "I had lunch with my meet up group today and this is where we went. I was really disappointed. First off it is very hard to find as they only have one little sign in the back. Then as I am walking towards the building I see a sign stating to please use the front entrance. So I walk around to the front of the building only to find out that there is no entrance in the front of the building so I have to walk all the way back again. I ordered two tacos (and unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of them) and I left hungry. I knew they were street tacos but I figured that for the price they would be a little bigger than normal street tacos. I was wrong. You do not get any chips and salsa and everything extra you want you pay for. I had ordered an iced tea and could not believe that they did not offer sweetener. They offered me some simple syrup however they did not have any artificial sweeteners of any kind. Luckily I had a few in my purse that I could use. We had asked to have separate checks when we first sat down but was told that was not possible. They did say they could split the bill up at the end. When it was time to go they could not split the bill according to what each of us had however. We had to do the math ourselves to tell them how much to put on each of our cards. Seriously??!! You're telling me you just bought a new POS system and it doesn't have that functionality??? Okay. So we give the waitress each of our cards and tell her how much to put on each and she brings them back. Oops she messed up and put his amount on my card and vice versa. Now we have to wait for her to go and correct that so we can be on our way. So needless to say I was very disappointed and feel that although the tacos were good, they were way overpriced for what you get. I feel like I spent way too much money to walk out hungry the way I did.",

One person working the open kitchen with servers and hostess just standing around waiting for food. I think communication in the restaurant business is so important. If these items were going to take awhile, or they noticed we were waiting this long, a simple - it'll be up shortly, or can I offer you something while you're waiting - would suffice.  I also had an empty water glass for 10 of those minutes.  Lunch special pricing would be helpful, given the price of tacos & side dishes is pretty high. I was also unmotivated to get a drink with no specials. I would recommend the managers train the staff to say \"but our happy hour starts at...\" I left not knowing what if any happy hour there is, as it wasn't posted or mentioned. Also - no black beans!",

We could not get a table at three different restaurants in the neighborhood, but walked into an almost empty dining room here.  The Four Roses Bourbon mule was underwhelming: no fizz to ginger beer and no mint. Waitress admitted drinks were premixed in batches-yuck. We had no silverware.  Our food was deposited and waitress walked off without noticing our lack of silverware.  The tacos were not piping hot, which was surprising given their lack of business.  My husband enjoyed his mushroom taco, which he had never tried.  Overall, the mediocre service and food and lack of attention to detail means we will not be back.  When all the restaurants up and down 40th are packed and overflowing, and yours is not, you better figure it out and soon.",

Cut to tonight when I ordered the kale salad to-go and found out their takeout process is a disaster. The teenager on the phone was very confused by my order (grilled vegetable salad, no cheese). She said 10-15 min and I arrived then and watched them start my order as I walked in. After waiting 25 min, I was given my salad and took it home to find it was missing the dressing, the corn, the pumpkin seeds and the raisins. It was literally just dry kale and avocado with some of the peel still on the pieces. I called and told them just to refund my card, but it was super disappointing because I thought I found my new to-go salad. Guess not.",

    "text": "LOVE. THIS. PLACE. We came here with our pup this past Sunday, sat outside and got ready to chow down on some tacos!   Drinks:  Michelada (with Modelo): Amazing. Pinche Paloma: So good! A grapefruit paloma, generous on the alcohol but no complaints ;)  Appetizer:  Queso Fundido Con Chorizo- Served with warm, salty freshly made chips! I was snacking on the chips before they cooled off, so yummy. The fundido was made with pepperjack cheese and topped with a super flavorful crumbled chorizo. My favorite part is when it cools down slightly and the cheese hardens- makes for a chewy delicious bite!   Tacos: Cachete de Res: This is a beef tongue taco. I am a beef tongue virgin and had heard that this is a very chewy meat and that it is not for everyone! I tried it on this taco and it was my favorite taco out of all three! Very flavorful and not at all super chewy, it was cut into small pieces and very easy to eat.  Asada: The Asada taco was so delicious and served as a great addition to the textures we were eating: chewy (beef tongue), tender (pork belly), and braised (asada). The meat from this taco immediately melted in my mouth and was VERY flavorful (just like everything else we had here)! Highly recommend the asada for sure.   Pork Belly \"Agridulce\": I was a little skeptical about this one, only because when we received the plateful of tacos, this one stood out to us: there was a big cube of pork belly right on top of one of the the tortillas. It was really difficult to eat this one for that reason, but I just cut the cube in half and ate it that way! It was really flavorful and the pork belly was very tender!  *All tacos were served with a few wedges of lime, and I am usually the first to go for the lime and douse my tacos in it, but the flavor in each of the tacos were so on point that I didn't even need to do that here!   Dessert:  Bourbon Tres Leches Cake: the person I came with is a total bourbon lover so he devoured this cake!   I am definitely coming back and trying out their brunch!  -Great date night spot -Outdoor Seating is dog friendly, we brought Mr. Boone! -Indoor/outdoor bar -Private/free parking lot",

I went into this location with my wife thinking we were in for a nice night out in a respectable establishment only to find that we were ignored the entire time by the staff I was given the worst attitude and heavy breaths by the staff at not knowing their menu or what was in the food on their menu in addition to this me and my wife contacted food poisoning in which they refused to acknowledge or even make it right by offering a refund, after reaching out to their manager Joe he before even finishing my explanation cut me off rudely spoke over me and started spewing out deflections and medical terminology as if he were a medical professional, in addition I reached out to their director of operations Steve Shoemaker and he also started throwing out deflections and accusations as to wether or not it happened at his establishment when he was literally the only place I'd eaten that day and completely ignored the horrible customer service not caring one bit about how we were treated laughing off the situation I'm not sure how this is acceptable from a director or operations standpoint or any type of management we've been treated horribly and completely ignored by Steve Shoemaker even as far as him attempting to say we were never even there to where I sent him screenshots of my bank statements showing I was and the date this is beyond unacceptable. I will continue to review this and share this with all social media and filing a complaint with the BBB so that they receive the Truest review they deserve for their horrible customer service practices and unhealthy food preparation practices.",

The brussel sprouts were AMAZING, so crispy and had such a good flavor, and for $4, who can beat that?! I thought the tacos were good but not great, but I am also a vegetarian, and really good vegetarian food is hard to find. I did cheat and try one of my boyfriends fish tacos, and I thought that was the best out of all of them! He liked his tacos more than I liked mine (so I'm sure if you eat meat you will love it). The tacos are only $3.50 eat which is super reasonable! Overall, it was a good experience and worth checking out!",

Love the aesthetic here. Place is smaller than expected but feels pretty big! Came on a 60 degree night and the patio with the heaters was even more comfortable and warmer than sitting inside. All of the staff was incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu items. The sushi-style ordering is a little odd, but we could definitely look past it.  We started off with the salsa and chips (got to choose our three salsas to come with it!!) and queso dip (a MUST try if you come here). The street tacos are incredibly flavorful and incredibly filling. There was not a single taco we received that we didn't like. We probably ordered 4/5 a piece but were too stuffed to get to the last of them by the time we were done with the apps.  Didn't get to try dessert but we definitely be back for more.   Faves of the evening: Monday Evening Happy hour - all night. What's there not to like?  Queso dip - this is not your velveeta queso dip. THANK GOD.  Agave chicken tacos - The Best mix of spices and a little sweetness.  Mexican coke - served in a large coke bottle. Delightful. Pinched Paloma - citrusy marg drink that's not too overwhelming.",

    "text": "So this is a story - I was going to rate this a 5+; however it quickly turned from one shift to another quickly in one day.  I will tell you, the tacos are the best I've had in town, seriously no doubt---unique, fresh, keeps you ordering more!  Matter of fact all the food is great.  I came in earlier in the day on a Friday before the busy time started and dropped over $120 only due to continuously really sampling everything.  We had a great server by he name of Mickey that was kind, customer service oriented, and extremely accomodating.  We live walking distance and I fell in love with this place along with my kids and a neighborhood friend.  At this time, 5+ stars!  Already recommended a handful of friends and neighbors that were curious as they hadn't been yet.  I quickly met my hubby there to eat dinner and we set at the bar.  He ordered three tacos and everything was still very good, however the customer service from a young, smart-alec millennial that had poor customer service and treated us as we should be lucky enough for him to take our order turned the entire experience and star rating!    I saw the bar manager that had come up with the most amazing margarita for me and asked him to get her to tell him what she did, well he messed it up and was extremely rude about having to remake it and brought back disgusting drinks that we paid for and left sitting at the bar.  I was appalled and wanted to share with the owner the experience just with this one employee that will deter customers from coming back or coming at all.  Food can be the best, but when you have a bad apple like this, you'll spoil your business.  I shared briefly what an a** this kid was to the bar manager and left.  It's a shame.  This was our first experience and the ending was horrific.    The first experience was awesome, but upon return after bragging, it was disappointment and embarrassing. We went out today and shared we would have gone here again, but due to the idiot at the bar, we didn't eat lunch here and tried another new amazing place down the street - \"Helio Basin\" that has unique food, great service and staff and to my understanding, the owner comes to regularly.    Now I've shared this bad experience with more than I recommended.  When I asked the jerks name at the bar, he quickly made up a name and said his name was \"Pickle.\"  Either that's a lie or perhaps that's the reason he's an a$$ due to the issues he's gone through.    Recommend to go and stay away from the bar but would hesitate if this behavior is tolerated to guests that is supporting local owners and contributing to paying the staff's wages.",

    "text": "I went to this place with high hopes, and being Arizona's Restaurant Week, I figured it was a great opportunity to try it out.  First of all, we got there with a group of 4 of us, and there was a 20 minute wait, which is fine, they were busy. We went to the bar, and the hostess reassured us she would come get us as soon as they had a table for us. 30 minutes passed, and no one had called us. The bartender actually is the one that was like, \"you guys have been waiting for a long time, huh?\", and he went to check w/ the hostess. Turns out, she had passed us for a table. That was annoying.   Anyways, we were finally moved to a table, the waiter came out, got our orders. We ordered to orders of queso fundido to start off, and some cocktails. The drinks came soon, but honestly, they were not very flavorful. My friend got a \"michelada\", which actually tasted like a bloody mary made w/ beer; it wasn't good. Finally, we received one order of the two queso fundidos. We all shared it since we saw the other one hadn't arrived. The 2nd order of queso fundido came way after we had already finished the first one.  After waiting for a while (which is fine, they were pretty busy), we got our tacos, we each tried 3 tacos each. The carne asada was bland. The chicken was all breading with no flavor. The pork belly was my \"favorite\". There were NO salsas w/ the tacos, which was very strange since tacos go hand in hand with a variety of salsa.  We finally got to dessert, we ordered tres leches cake, and churros. Jesus Christ, I was sad! The tres leches cake had a weird texture, it didn't feel soft and moist like tres leches usually feels, plus it was also bland, it didn't even taste sweet. Now, the churros...what a disappointment. They felt uncooked, and too bready. Very weird. The only good thing was the hot chocolate dipping sauce, it was like concentrated chocolate abuelita.   The place is pricey, we just got a good deal because of AZ's restaurant week, but I will most likely not be back. The place is lost in wanting to be \"trendy\", but they forgot about the flavors. Just go to La Santisima.",

    "text": "Besides having the best name ever, Tacos Tequila and Whiskey's layout is actually pretty cool with a large Frida painting and ample outdoor seating. We reviewed the extensive menu and ordered five different tacos, pinche papas (sloppy Joe fries), a Paloma and a Michelada. Our drinks came out first and we both loved them, a great balance of spirits and craft. Maybe I don't go to enough bars, but I've never seen Michelada on the menu, and appreciated the fact that they make it here. When our pinch papas came out, it was hard not to experience emotions of pure glee. Yep, glee. I haven't had pizza fries in a while, and while this wasn't exactly pizza fries, it was reminiscent of it as this was a sloppy Joe version, heaped with lots of cheese. If you're a cheese lover, you will enjoy them as the cheese was so stringy - that's when you know it's GOOD cheese.  Finally, the stars of the show, the tacos, came out. Every single one tasted great as the meat tacos were all cooked perfectly. I would say that the Pork Belly \"Agridulce\" and the Hongos was my favorite. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and though the Hongos was a vegetarian taco, the combination of ingredients was Mexican corn (that cojita cheese and corn) meets shitaki mushrooms. Corn, great. Mushrooms, great. Both together in a taco? I'm down. Overall, I'm glad this Denver based restaurant has come out to Phoenix. Although it only just opened, I know we'll be back to try more.",

    "text": "I like this place so this is kind of a tough review. Originally gave it 2 stars then upgraded to 3 as a I've been going here fairly regularly and discovered their happy-hour sliders. Probably if I lived in another neighborhood, TTW would get 4 stars  and certainly more from others. Here's why.   There's a fun, indoor/outdoor atmosphere a little reminiscent of the Old Town open air bars, with a trendy latin flavor. Nice patio to chill on a lazy Arcadia weekend or happy hour. Music lends a party atmosphere but the hip club/dj set list wasn't our cup of tea.  Prices reflect the atmosphere although food quality has room for improvement at this tier.   There's a friendly, diverse waitstaff that seems to enjoy what they're doing and wants to take good care of their clientele. That's TTW's best asset. They seemed a little rushed but present enough to answer questions, offer recommendations, and share some laughs. With these personalities I met, I suspect the rushed vibe should work itself out soon as they hit their stride. I'll come back  because it's in my backyard and for the atmosphere / social experience.  We had barbacoa and lamb tacos. Lamb was tasty but oversauced IMO and more messy than I prefer. Sometimes that's fine but this  seemed like they may missed the mark with consistency? The barbacoa was ok but not stand-out. Chicharrones at $4 were the best I've had. These chicken skins were delish and I'll come back for more.  So, it's a tough review and only 2 stars because our neighborhood is blessed with some of the best \"gourmet taco\" joints you're  likely to find anywhere. Competition in this category, in our neighborhood, is tough these days. The tacos I had at TTW's  don't rank with Crujiente or Helio Basin's delightful creations. And, with a number of great street taco joints just down the road for $1 or so a pop, I want my $4-5 tacos to be amazing.",

I also loved the pork belly taco.  The others all looked very good.   I know I'm not part of their targeted demographic, so the tall round stools were really uncomfortable for me.

When I came out of restroom he approached me again trying to differentiate between service and therapy dog and said the patio is dog friendly- no patio is dog friendly in 105 degrees.

Started with the queso dip which is the only thing I wasn't impressed with. It comes in this small skillet but it's extremely hard to get the cheese on the chip. Ordered 6 tacos which were all delicious! I'm happy they are in my neighborhood and I'll definitely be back.",

They have a patio that looks amazing but it was wayyy too hot for that.  We ordered the house margerita, it was pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was the salt that they used on the rim, it seemed like it was just table salt.   My boyfriend got the limeaid soda, he liked it but it was too key lime tasting to me, very sour.   We ordered the nachos and slider combo.  The chips are made in house and have a great crunch and flavour, everything that they topped the nachos with was great too. They weren't really heaping nachos, but everything on there tasted good. We ended up ordering another plate!  The sliders were all pretty nice. The buns were sweet and fresh and the sauces went really well with the burgers. My personal favourite was the beef dip. The jus that they serve with it was heavenly. To warn you the chorizo sloppy Joe is a bit spicy, but still good. The shrimp one had a perfect fry on it and was tasty.  I was a little disappointed that none of the tacos were on their happy hour menu, but I want to come back here again and try some other stuff!",

Everything we tried was wonderful :) I had their Paloma Margarita, which had Squirt in it; I've never had that in a margarita and it was so good! We also tried the nachos, several different tacos and churros for dessert. They serve the churros with a warm chocolate sauce, it was amazing. I've never been a big churro person but I'll want to get those every time!",

    "text": "I have been looking forward to trying this place since the sign popped up a few months ago. Tacos Tequila Whiskey does not disappoint.  The tacos are on the expensive side, but the meat is cooked perfectly, the sauces aren't overwhelming and the toppings are on point.   The menu is set up similar to a sushi restaurant where you use a dry erase marker to choose what you want to order. We got carne asada, carnitas, pollo a la crema and barbacoa to get a nice sampling. The tacos are double wrapped to keep the juicy meats together and the sauces served on the side match perfectly with each taco.  Let's talk drinks! It's impossible to go to a place called Tacos Tequila Whiskey and leave without trying a cocktail or two. I tried their unique take on a Moscow Mule. The drink substituted vodka for tequila and included some cucumber and chili flavors. Very good!  We also tried the chips and guacamole, which were good, but not the best I've had. Plus we ended our meal with an order of sweet and crunchy churros with chocolate sauce.  Overall Tacos Tequila Whiskey is a great addition to the Arcadia neighborhood. Food and drinks are great and the atmosphere is trendy and cool. I recommend giving it a shot!",

The tacos are ordered like a sushi menu and brought out all on one plate. It's too time consuming to figure out who ordered what tacos and divvy them up. They also don't do split checks, so any more than 4 people and it's going to get complicated. I personally think the system is kind of weird and serves no purpose, but I love the food so I deal with it. It's the only reason I don't give 5 stars.",

There are so many other options new by. Don't waste your money. I was a little annoyed too by the decor. The service was nice and attentive. My review is based merely off the food. We tried the fries appetizer that had chorizo on it. No flavor. And was served cold. We tried 5 different tacos and they were al bad. I'm not sure why this place has 4 stars.",

Any place that splurges on RO systems to get you not only good water but good ice, is a business that knows what the hell they're doing.   Dude seriously so delicious, the first time I tried it was in Denver and was blown away. Me and my now fiance got tipsy and ate delicious tacos and fell in love with the place in Denver so it's nice to have a location here now where we can relive our sentiment. Anyways the tacos are great, most of them are not your traditional styled tacos but still super bomb, I haven't had one I didn't like. Their salsas are phenomenal. It's a cute date idea, for drinks I recommend the Paloma's.",
