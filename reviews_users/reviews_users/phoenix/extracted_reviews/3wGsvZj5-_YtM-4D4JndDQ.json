    "text": "Sunny's isn't a hard place to write a review for and most things are negative. Be very wary of this diner.  As stated in other reviews the carpets are beyond needing to be cleaned and replaced and most of the servers always appear dirty. They need to employee a standard for clean clothes, good order taking books that are not ripped up and uniformity. I know you are a diner but dang first impressions are everything.   What is driving the bad review at first was a comment from their own wait staff that they employ for cash undocumented workers in the back. I mentioned are you sure and they pointed and said see right there.  This is another matter onto itself that I am reporting.   But the food is bland and two separate dishes looked about the same. The use of cheese is overly used and we have to scrape most off to finish it. Better food and cleanliness can be found most anywhere else.   While this is a diner for college students take a little pride and clean up your business.",

I got a standard breakfast... 2 eggs, 3 pancakes, 2 bacon, and some hash browns. The eggs were unseasoned as well as the potatoes. Just very bland and forgettable. The pancakes were like cardboard. I've never ever needed a knife to cut pancakes at any other restaurant.  It was a strange thing.  The bacon wasn't bad, but it's not the best I've ever had. So overall just a 'meh' experience.",

Being at Sunny's has a better feeling than the chain restaurants!. Our table ordered El Patron a Must try layers of yummyness the flavor in the Chorizo is mmmm that's how I remember it.  Now for The Eggs Benedict the ingredients in the Olga called out to me I just new this plate was what my mouth watered for.  I placed my fork on top and sliced it right down the middle no  runny mummy yolk :(  If you know you're Egg's Benedict do not order them here. Lots of regulars which is a plus. Yes I will be back for the Outstanding Service and The Amazing Coffee.  So many more items on the menu to try.",

As Soon as we pulled in approximately 239pm , I was helping my mother out of the car,when I saw a waitress make a mad dash to flip the close sign. There were people still inside. I'm sure she saw us pull in and didn't want to be bothered. What she doesn't know is ,I'm a Phoenix UPS employee who was told by a Tempe  UPS employee ( that's right around the corner and gives them much business)this was a cool place to bring clients, family and so forth. A very Bad experience before I even tried the food...that said a lot for me...oh BTW I called and they close at 3 pm...no customer service.",

For both of us we had French toast with two eggs and two pieces of bacon, and biscuits and gravy with two eggs and two pieces of sausage and our total was about $16... Not bad.   Overall the food was pretty good.... Nothing spectacular. The French toast was definitely the best of the bunch.   My biggest hold up for this place was the service. It was pretty bad. We were seated by one of the bus boys and I wish he could have been our server, he was on point. He ended up taking out drink order and said our server would be there shortly... After waiting close to 10 minutes we had to ask for our server to come take our order. After taking it he had to come back twice to confirm our order... I mean I would rather that than him just guess but it's not like our order was anything complicated. Once our food arrived he never came back to refill our drinks or check on how the food was. I think he meant well but just wasn't prepared to handle more than a couple tables.  Overall we were less than thrilled with Sunny's. I suppose it's a good place for some hangover breakfast and we noticed that they have significantly cheaper prices Monday-Friday.",

The gravely was floury and tasteless. I had the huevos rancheros, overall okay but my eggs were way too runny for medium and the home fries were like little rocks. Our server was rude and took forever to bring water, instead talking to the other waitresses and hanging out by the kitchen. Our bill was $29, way too pricey for what we considered to be a pretty disappointing meal. We left a 10% tip and will not be returning.",

The omelet was well put together with a side of home fries and  toast. The biscuits and gravy on the other hard were not all that great. It's all most like the kitchen staff had dumped an entire bottle of pepper into the gravy mix making it inedible.

    "text": "The food was delicious. I ordered the Tex-Mex and that wasn't very special. Thought it would work better in a different plating style. My friends ordered some good looking food though.   When I requested a table, there were already 5 parties ahead of me by around 10:10. My party was for 8 people. The restaurant let me know that it would be 10-15. I understand that it takes a long time to seat a group of 8 but why tell us a certain time and seat us 50 minutes later. Their reason for not seating us in time is because they forgot about us. Sometimes it happens.   I'd go back but will order something else. When I go back I plan on getting some pancakes or something else other than the Tex-Mex.   It's a very casual place. Dennys has better decorations and seating. The price is about the same as Dennys but I feel you get better flavored food and service and quality of food for price at Sunnys Diner. If ever in Tempe if eat breakfast at Sunny Dinner.   Thanks for the good time!",

You are greated at the door by a large banner that touts \"spaghetti served all day!\" I can honestly say that I considered having it for breakfast just because it was an option! The staff was smiling, friendly, and helpful from the hostess to the servers. The menu is huge with one page devoted solely to omelettes as well as standard fare and sweet extravagances like banana chocolate chip pancakes. I chose the Bubba Gump omelette and my companion had the Pancho omelette. Normally he will eat his entire breakfast but this time he had to get a box as did I so the portions are great if you like to have leftovers. I will definitely go back to try other items and maybe that spaghetti for breakfast!",

Pros: They have a AWESOME PAINTING OF ITALY! really cool love it. They have great coffee.   Cons: Supper stuffy and hot when I walked in the door. Had to ask to turn on the fan nearby.  I ordered a waffle anything but airy and soft. I was hungry so I ate it.  Was a bit confused on why a cup of fruit was not an alternative for a side. Instead you had to pay extra for it. Not a reasonable extra like 3 dollars extra for like this tiny bowl of fruit. Really disappointed at that because for the amount of money you paid for the food it was very little. Don't mind paying the amount if its worth it.",

Think of a Denny's that has seen better days. It's locally owned. The waitresses are friendly and keep coffee cups full. The demographic of the clientele seems nicely mixed, with some families, some students, some professionals, some not so professional.   So why only three stars? The food on this day could have been better (and I suspect it usually is). When I visit a breakfast spot for the first time I either go simple or order their specialty. This was a simple day. Pancakes, scrambled eggs & bacon. The bacon was perfect, served crisp as requested. The eggs, however, weren't well scrambled. Not a terribly big deal. The pancakes, however, were tough in consistency and had spent a little too much time on the grill. The flavor of char is great when you're talking hamburgers, but not so much when you're tasting pancakes. I'm anxious to give Sunny's another try, next time earlier in the day. I can see the potential.",

In our party of 5 everyone thought their meal was lack luster and not worth it.  Both my friend and I had the 3 egg Huevos Rancheros with green chili beef (sounded promising).  My friend complained about the small portion of eggs insisting he got 2 eggs.. most of the plate was potato, beans and garnish.  The chili wasn't anything special, the beef was dry and sparse, no cheese.  If having diner food, I would expect diner prices.  There were Very few $6 options and half of the lighter options were kids meals.  On average, meals were $10 - $12.",

This was the worst gyro we've ever had and from a restaurant owned by someone named Papamatheakis I would have expected much much better.  The pita was toasted so was hard instead of soft and chewy and the meat was tough and dried out.  Neither of us finished our meal. The three tiny pieces of tomato were a joke. There were no or few customers in the place so it wasn't a case of being there at a busy time.  I will not go back.  We did get a portion off our bill but it's to little too late.  I can't recommend this place.",

I was only able to eat about half of it and now I'm regretting eating that much. I got tortillas with it and when unrolling them there was little bits of lettuce in it, makes you wonder what else they could have had on them.

I forgot my to go box and walked back in a few minutes later in a panic. The table was then cleared off and the food was gone..keep in mind I've been to a lot of restaurants and the times that I almost forgot my left overs the waitress has always been alert to what's going on and has always notified me that I'm forgetting my card or my food or my purse etc, however this was not the case this time. I spoke with who turned out to be the owner and he said that after reviewing the tape that they wouldn't make me a new meal because I was gone for over 15 minutes which was not True. I've been in customer service for over 6 years and whether you are in the wrong or not it's good to work with the customer so that are happy and will want to come back again. What I experienced her is a lack of professionalism at this place, from their service to their own owner! The food is good yes, but everything else has left a bad taste in my mouth.",

    "text": "Ate there once before about a week ago, had Jessica for waitress she was great! Came back again today, ordered same thing, a greek omelet gyro meat on side, not in omelet, and was told by different waitress that the boss told her I can NEVER order meat on side again! I told her I would order how I like, thanks. I was also told to wait for this omelet today would be at least 30 minutes?? Confused and hungry I asked for a piece of toast while I wait, she said I would have to pay for that?? Again, confused why someone who has to wait for food so long, because kitchen is backed up is beyond restaurant etiquette... as I know it. Waited,  was brought out my toast 30 minutes before my omelet, even though I asked for ONE piece, so as to leave ONE piece left for the meal itself. Please tell me, what the heck is the difference if gyro meat is in or out of omelet? They just lost a regular customer that would have given them... $572.00 per year, and that's not including my guests that would come w/me. that will NO LONGER eat here either!",

The waitress came back and stated, \"No the cooks can not do that bc it will dirty up the pan.\"  I requested the manager to come and speak to me and he stated, \"People ask for this all the time and we can not do it bc American cheese will stick to our pans and we can not clean them bc we are too busy.\"  I asked, \"Why not just buy nonstick pans?\"  He stated, \"We just don't do it here.\"  This was my first and last time going to a breakfast focused diner that refuse to make a simple request!

    "text": "Hey, so I'm kind of new to writing Yelp reviews. Recently went to San Fran where I survived off of using it, so I'm going to try paying it back in Tempe. :)  I've been coming to Sunny's for about a year. I don't usually like eating out in Tempe because I'm a poor grad student, and I can survive off ramen if I have to. But Sunny's is a place I find myself at at least once a week. This is diner food. That's it's strength! I'm a convert to the chili burger, and when I'm here with friends they keep the coffee cups full. My burgers have always been perfectly cooked, heaped with chili, cheese, and a splash of pico de gallo. I like to drown my food in hot sauce and the fries are always hot.  The owner is the kind of guy that will sit down and chat with you about your day, the food, his family's history in the food business (his folks run a Greek diner over in the Sun City/Glendale area). You can spend an hour here just reading and sipping at your coffee- nobody will ever shoo you out. The staff have ended up knowing us by name and seating us at \"our\" table, which is over by the window, facing University.  I'll be blunt; if there are bad reviews here, it's from people that don't know the area and don't know what they want. Sunny's is not gourmet, vegan-friendly, gluten-free food. I like restaurants that can make those accommodations but I don't expect every restaurant ever to cater to obscure allergies. This is not a steakhouse that's got $40 ribeye waiting on the grill for you at 10am.  Just give this place a try, and go for that comfort fried food you know you want- chicken tenders, chorizo skillets, burgers or THE PANCAKES. This is the best breakfast joint in town! You want to eat somewhere where the staff will remember you and enjoy the experience of having YOU come in? This is the place.  Hope you come in soon and have the kind of hometown experience me and my friends have. :)",

The owner Alex is very rude and creates a hostile environment for guests and customers alike. He curses at his workers in front of guests and disrespects everyone around him. Today I was in eating breakfast and I was present for an argument he was having with an employee of his. Apparently he fired her and found it necessary to do this in front of the staff and a full restaurant while cursing at her and telling her to get out while taunting her waving and saying bye. That is not professional and no one should have to deal with that talk from their boss. And last week while I was there, there was a group of servers and a male manager discussing the owner Alex and how he is potentially stealing tips from employees. This is enough to make you want to not support this restaurant. I have been in the restaurant business for over 15 years and this is the most poorly run establishment I have been to in a very long time. DO NOT SUPPORT THE OWNER ALEX OR HIS BUSINESS!!",

We sat at the counter since that was the only thing available and it was pretty cramped but comfortable seats. I got the Denver omelette, no cheese with fruit and whole wheat toast. My boyfriend got the Mexican skillet. The service was relatively slow but it was a busy Sunday so that's understandable.   The food came and unfortunately I was served hash browns instead of the fruit I ordered, but the waitress dropped the food off so quickly I wasn't able to correct it. Our waitress was no where to be seen for at least 10 minutes so I just decided to suck it up. The hash browns were awful, not crispy whatsoever and absolutely zero seasoning. Not worth eating in my opinion. The omelette, despite having no cheese was the greasiest omelette I've ever eaten. After I managed to take a few bites I mentioned to my boyfriend that it feels like I'm eating a greasy cheeseburger instead of eggs, it was that bad. His skillet was decent, but he wouldn't get it again. He did say the coffee was decent.   Another small thing that also bothered me was that the toast came already buttered. I know that can be standard diner protocol, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time or have to option to have plain toast.   In short, stick with Chompie's, it's worth the wait.",

The service is top notch, I'm a vegetarian, and my waiter Marty upgraded my veggie omelet to feta and egg whites for under 2 bucks.  So, I recommend it to all my vegetarian friends out there who are having a hard time finding wholesome food to eat. Anyway, I got my coffee and water right away, My food was ready right away.  Seriously, I got my order  before I opened up my laptop.    The omelette was delicious, and so were the homefries, Marty kept the coffee comming, I enjoyed my meal very much! So, that's a 10. Thank You Sunny's",

It's a great family restaurant when we have the kids with us. The owner is as nice as can be. The service has always been good. I love their soups. I think I've only had breakfast here a couple times but they were great. I've had a variety of lunch and dinner items from the menu and everything has been extra good. Their Greek meatloaf is especially good and very unique. Their prices are extremely reasonable so when I am with a larger group it is still affordable. They even have a senior menu along with the kids menu. I can't think of a single bad thing to say unless it might be to complain that they aren't closer to me so I can come here more often. I keep telling the guy he needs to open up a location in Chandler! And I sometimes wish he was open later in the day because I'm a late starter and by the time I'm in the area it is too often after they have closed.",

Plus, the food's way better!  Since my last review the menu's changed a little, but the quality and quantity of food you get is still consistently good. I ordered the special for the day- the meatloaf breakfast. At around $10, it was an large helping of sliced meatloaf covered in gravy, 3 eggs, with your choice of toast/biscuit and hash browns.  The meatloaf was dense and packed with flavor. The hash browns, as always, were excellent, cooked on the griddle perfectly. I opted for a biscuit, which was a large fist-sized portion, light and fluffy tasting. It was so much food I could only finish about half.  Service was friendly and drinks were refilled as needed.   Overall, still a great place to dine!",

(My personal feelings are not super important, but I hate idiots who do no go above and beyond to learn even the smallest aspects of service, including directions:) hew!!   now that this is off my chest.  If you are like me and like to do like the locals and not chains. This is awesome. Get on the metro go to the Mc Clintock station. If you get off the station and you were going east. Look at the light going east (there sholud be a apartment building called tempe metro on your left if you are facing the traffic light)turn right. There will be a Pride gas station on the oposite side of the street to your left if you are walking straight down Mc clintock. Continue to Walk down Mc Clintock for about 5 to 7 minutes and the place is on your right.At the corner of university Dr and Mc clintock . just like the last guy (after getting off train 2 times with a 3 yr old)  informed me.)  Food is great, service was great. I was happy after the directions f! $@#^ up",

    "text": "Too expensive for the quality of food served.   We went to Sunny's Diner for a leisurely sit-down breakfast. It looked to be a fair place owned by a family, and we had hoped to find a good \"hole in the wall\" place to eat breakfast, rather than our old standby.   I was served my first ever shell in my egg. That's not a deal-breaker but was surprising. In all my years of eating eggs cooked in this fashion I had never crunched into an eggshell fragment while eating.   We ordered off the \"special\" menu and believed our dishes were $3.99 each. We added fruit & whipped cream after asking how much fruit came with the $2.50 upgrade price--the waitress told us a large handful of strawberries, a large handful of blueberries, and a whole banana would adorn each of our now-$6.49 meals.   This was not the case.   And our meals were an extra dollar each. When pointing out the price on the menu to the waitress, she said other people had been fooled by that, too, and offered to take the $2 off our bill--and then did not.   All in all, it comes down to this: I was lied to, misdirected, and given a fraudulent product. And the product itself was so-so, earning a Waffle House 3-star \"meh\" rating on its own merits.   We will not be going back. I hope others have better luck at Sunny's Diner than we did.",

Our waiter came over told us the best plates they had (based on customer reviews) and he let us be to look through the menu. When we were ready to order, we waited a good 15-20 minutes before we got someone's attention since our waiter was in the back room chatting it up with another Coworker. Anyways, we got our food and my boyfriend got biscuits and gravy and I got the French toast with bananas and strawberries. My boyfriends biscuits were drowning in gravy which didn't look too appetizing. Also, his \"biscuits\" taste more like hamburger buns drenched in gravy... they were a very weird textured. When I took my first bite of my French toast it was okay.. not too much flavor in it and the strawberries were very sour. I wouldn't recommend going here honestly... I could've made a breakfast that was more tasteful",

I have gone to other restaurants and had similar dishes, but found myself saying, \"It was good, but it wasn't as good as Sunny's\".  I wish that I could give a more comprehensive review with my opinion on a selection of items, but I enjoy these eggs too much to have ordered much of anything else here. . .  One thing that I have had other than the huevos is their pasta with the homemade tomato-meat sauce--that was primo.  The only issue that I had with it was that the serving was much too small.  If you want a plate of great pasta, get a double order, stuff that napkin into your shirt and go to town.",

Another server seated some of her friends, who insisted on sitting in the closed section. They were obnoxiously loud and vulgar and she allowed it. Later, when they got some scowls from the six other diners, she hushed them.   On to breakfast: the eggs were overcooked but not by much. The breakfast potatoes were good, with a mix of fluffy and crunchy potatoes and no peppers, yay!  The Muffin was pretty tough tho and required a knife. The corned beef hash good, with a good balance of meat to potatoes.",

The host asked what I wanted to drink and I told her coffee, 15 minutes later I still didn't have my drink, as the server was taking the 2 persons sitting next to me order he looked at me and realized I wasn't being helped and he say \"you're drink is coming\" I said okay he comes back 5 minutes later to ask what I had even order. I told him coffee, he brings me a coffee with no creamers or sugar doesn't even ask if I wanted them. And I wouldn't be this upset if the people next to me didn't receive all the extras. Then He places the cup of coffee so far from me and puts the spoon in the mug for some reason. Never comes back. This was by far the worst experience I've had at a diner. The fact that I was treated so poorly while the people around me were getting helped made me feel so unwelcome. I immediately left . And I took a picture of where the server place mug.",

The steak was a third fat that I had to get rid of. Unfortunately this was my first experience at this diner and the owner and his buddy decided to sit at the booth next to me. Because there were no other diners in the immediate area I could not help but overhear their entire conversation. Conversation consisted of complaints about servers needing pens, the awkwardness of singing happy birthday to people when you don't know their names, it went on and on.  After 7 years in the food service industry I already knew about all of the problems.  They're normal.   And I didn't enjoy the owner's bitch session.   It ruined my meal. Who in their right mind is having these conversations in front of customers?",

Sunny's knows what it is, and it excels at being just that: a friendly, coffee-rich diner that treats you like a regular even if you're not, and treats you like a friend when you are. The staff prides itself on bringing you coffee. I've had, on multiple occasions, two staff ask me if I needed my coffee topped off within the span of fifteen seconds. Really, this is a great haunt of mine! My friends recently set up my 25th birthday celebration here and the staff all got into it. They let my buddies make a reservation with balloons and candles and etcetera. Sunny's doesn't take reservations. They did for me, though! And that's why I love them. They are pragmatic and don't let silly red-tape get in the way. Hell, they apologize if there IS a wait. Check it out.",

This was my first and last time I go to a place that believes they can charge you extra for \"gyro sauce\" and say that my groupon wasn't covering the sauce even though the groupon states that I have an certain amount of value. The service was ridiculous as well. It took the waitress 15 mins to take our food order and the place was dead. She only came over to us because the owner told her too. My grandma right from the start ordered the extra sauce wasn't told it was going to cost her extra. She had to ask for the sauce 3 times before it arrived to the table and then told her it was going to cost us more money....I then got so infuriated  the owner came over and told my grandma to open her gyro to find the EXTRA SAUCE (if you have to go searching for EXTRA sauce... I guess it  wasn't much of extra sauce..) .. Then told me that that there is a separate charge that wasn't covered.. I told him we were leaving and not going to pay for the food that wasn't going to be covered under our groupon.(90% of our food wasn't eaten) He told me he was going to call the cops. Which he did and the cops pulled me  over half way home and came to the conclusion that this wasn't a criminal matter and he would have to sue me. Which is fine with me who tries to sue someone for food someone hasn't eaten and was mostly paid for anyways!! This place will be closed in a year...",

Let me start with the super-friendly staff who were good with my questions and had some rock-solid recommendations. I had the signature waffle - which comes with heaping piles of bananas, strawberries, and blueberries. The whipped cream was nice but I could have lived without the cinnamon. The waffle came with a side of eggs and sausage which were mediocre. My friend had the Denver omelette which she described as \"pretty damn tasty\". The omelette came with home fries which were good. A huge plus for Sunny's for the coffee. I expected bulk burned crap, but found a nice cup. They brew into thermoses (or is the plural thermi?) and buy whole bean coffee from a local roaster. They could rate 4 stars just for that! But overall this was an excellent recommendation from the yelp community.",

Today's meal was so good, I decided I just had to write another review.  As I often do, I picked a booth near the window so I could watch the foot and car traffic (Sunny's sits right at the SE Corner of University and McClintock).  My server, Jocelyn,  was so nice.  She didn't seem to mind that I was a table of one, she refilled my water several times without being asked, she got my order in quickly,  and my lunch was in front of me in less than 10 minutes.   I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs...WOW, it was delicious.   The meatballs had so much flavor, the meat just falls apart in your mouth,  and even though you only get two, they are so large you need no more.  The meat sause is generous, tangy, with enough spices to keep you interested til the very last bite.  This is a serious plate of spaghetti,  and you get two half slices of Texas toast with it.  At $5.99, there simply is no better meal in Tempe.",

Never was good eating it out of styrofoam and I had no salt or pepper or any sauce. It was still good and went down fast. Quantity was decent for price. I got the simple eggs bacon and potatoes meal for $3.99. Came with toast also but had them hold that. I would go back.",

Their biscuit tasted like add water $1 store pancake mix (same goes for the pancakes we shared) the omelette was not cooked all the way through and was overloaded on spinach and greasy cheese, the home style fries their \"specialty hashbrowns\" were burnt and had some type of sugary consistency.  I felt sick several minutes after eating and chose to just pay the check and leave, I left the waitress a $2 tip for a $20 check and then heard another waitress who happened to walk by our table tell her what I left her and our waitress said \"are you f***ing kidding me\" I'm sorry but this is not a place we will return to. On a whole the food was mediocre at best and the waitress was rude I tipped 10% which is normal and she was extremely ungrateful.",

I would love to give it more stars because the wait staff was wonderful, friendly, fast & kept our drinks filled.  Unfortunately, a fight including \"F-Bombs\" in the kitchen with the accompanying sounds of things being thrown as apparently some poor staff person was being verbally assaulted made us very uncomfortable.  Then my \"hand-breaded\" chicken fried steak arrived, looked just like the frozen ones at Costco, tasted like the same brand Village Inn/Denny's/I-HOP use. The home fries were dry & inedible as were the biscuits.  Coffee was good, so was the sausage gravy, but next time I want breakfast out I will head south to Chase's Diner.",

Unlike the experience I had at Dennys in the Flagstaff mall last weekend. I don't even want to repeat how bad the service was there.   At any rate...my food came out within minutes of my server seating me and he brought my drink order with extra ice and an ice water before my food was served. Wow! Just how I like it and before I could finish my first drink of water he'd already asked if I needed another one. It's hard nowadays to find such great service in Arizona..especially in the food industry.   I would hope that every business in the service industry could WOW me like Erica and her staff so efficiently and pleasantly did at the University & McClintock Dr. location.

    "text": "Saturday mornings my husband, son and I go out for \"Saturday Morning PJ Breakfast\" it's a chance to try a new place and be silly in our 'Jammie's.   We drove by Sunnys constantly while living in Tempe and finally decided to stop. I am so glad we did. This is our favorite breakfast spot.   They're always hustling even when they aren't super busy. The wait staff are friendly and sweet To my son. They have a great menu filled with comfort food, and some new treasures.   I am absolutely in love with the Irish Benedict. It's a gorgeous take on eggs Benedict with corned beef hash instead of tradition ham. It takes all my self control not to order it every time we visit. Their potatoes are also perfect every time.   Their kids menu is perfect sized for my toddler and he loves their pancakes.   Anyone who is in Tempe and hungry for breakfasts needs to visit Sunnys.",

The food was fantastic (my wife and I had breakfast - she had bacon and eggs and I had a pork chop and eggs) and the staff was very friendly and right on top of their game.  Prices were very reasonable and the quality of the food was better than expected. This is what a family-run kind of business should be. I have no idea if this is a family-run business, but it has the feel of one the way the folks there seemed to care about what they were doing. We'll definitely be back.  Edited to add: We've been back there a few times now for breakfast and lunch (and dinner on Friday evenings) and I have to say we'll keep going there. The owner does everything from cooking to cleaning, serving to seating, and the staff will make things right if you don't think everything's as good as it should be. The place can get crowded from time to time and I'm happy it can since it deserves to be busy.",

I got the waffle with the fresh strawberries and bananas with two scrambled eggs. It was quite good. I also got a tea but I didn't like being charged $2+ for a lipton tea. C'mon tea should have free refills like coffee or charge less for it. I'd go back and try something else but I won't get the tea.",

They do need to work on getting orders up a little quicker (which a simpler menu would help with).",

I ordered a breakfast burrito, our table also ordered peanut butter chocolate pancakes, French toast, and an omelet... the peanut butter chocolate pancakes is a good choice for someone who has a sweet tooth and loves Reese's.. French toast was fluffy.. and my burrito was filling.. I asked for their gravy on the side out of curiosity, it had a nice peppery flavor.

The service was good and their waiters and waitresses were fast and kind. They kept our water, coffee and juice filled. We had stopped in for lunch. But I must say I was unable to dinner afterwards.   I will be returning. They had a few things on the menu that I want to try. That plus an easy-going atmosphere works for me.",

I ordered the plain French toast with sides of home fries and bacon and I had nothing to complain about! My friend, a food expert, ordered the chicken fried steak and loved it! Also, their coffee is fantastic!! Their menu had a variety of options so anyone could find something.  Overall, I give Sunny's a 5/5 for having a comfortable, easy going environment with great food and service!",

So after having the meat lover's breakfast option, I can fairly say that the food is not very good. My scrambled eggs had a very plastic-y consistency and had about zero taste, and I've no idea how that is even possible. The potatoes didn't seem seasoned, so they were pretty bland. I wish I could have explained this to the server, but the only times she came by were to quickly check on us as she moved about the dining room to a different table or to do other things. I don't blame them though, I think the entirety of the staff are just ASU students. Regardless, it was just an overall poor experience. I mean, the table and booth were not even completely clean from the previous diners. When you think of going out to breakfast, you expect the experience to at least be better than what you could put together at home, and for Sunny's this is just not the case.",

The service was friendly and efficient.  Likely the best part of the experience.  The food was overpriced.  Tried the Irish Benedict.  I liked it overall but the hollandaise (which is usually one of my favorite breakfast items) was unusually dark yellow and bland.  I wondered if it was made from a packaged powder.  The potatoes it came with had some nice crispy parts but were overall bland and flavorless as well.  I did get a very good portion size.  My daughter had the chicken fried steak and loved it.  Other daughter had french toast and thought the one I make at home is better.  Cost was $50 for three breakfast plates and three beverages.  I did not think it was worth it.  Don't think I'll be back.",

Sunnys was on my way from southwest Mesa to Old Town so I stopped to get my usual. I forget how much I love their chicken fried steak and eggs, home style potatoes and a cup of coffee. It's just so basic and comfortable. Grabbed the small table in the middle, got my coffee  water and placed my order all in one shot. Food came out in less than 5 minutes. Now granted, there were only about 6, 7 people in there when I came in and it was quite full when I left so judge accordingly. Crisp, tasty, very hot steak, perfect over easy eggs, a warm tortilla and crisp potatoes helped get the morning started. Spent somevtime reading a book on my phone while I ate, and that's when most of the crowd showed up. Still, dishes cleared, refill my coffee twice and check dropped off from a great and friendly staff. Is it gourmet eating? NOPE. But good, tasty comfort food for breakfast cant be beat.  Sunnys is in Tempe on McClintock and University and is 15 minutes from the airport. 30 minutes from campus because,  hey! Its Tempe and traffic slows to a crawl around ASU.",

Don't buy the Groupon deal expecting to find \"Up to $32 for $16,\" or whatever the specifics are.  The only thing on the menu that would take two meals to $32 is the Ribeye steak, which they no longer carry.  In fact, forget the entire dinner menu because they are only open for a couple of hours on Friday evening and that's for a fish fry.   If you both order the chicken fried steak or sirloin steak and eggs breakfast, you'll make a couple of bucks on the coupon, but for anything else it's probably a better deal to just pay menu and not worry about an expiration.",

When my dad suggested going to Denny's I told him to get the fuck out of here and I then broke out my yelp app and searched nearby. Sunny's had good reviews and we made our way over. As a people I think we should support independent restaurants even if it costs a bit more than the swill served at I Hop. It worked out good because Sunny's was low key with great food at  prices that were lower than the chains. I ordered the gyro skillet and I left stuffed and satisfied. My dad got one of the $4.99 breakfast specials and was impressed as well.  Great value for the money.   Go to hell Denny's.",

I've gotten the 2 eggs, home fries, sausage or bacon, & toast special which costs only $3.99. In my experience, the home fries are always mushy and pretty unappetizing & the turkey sausage is alway dry. The greek omelet is pretty tasty ... especially the side of tzatziki.  Our last experience with the service was interesting - our waitresses Jennifer came to check on us about 6 times within like 10 minutes! We placed our order & our food was brought out to us. She came to make sure everything looked okay - completely okay. She came back again 2 more times to ask if everything was okay - a little annoying. And what put us over the top was that she came over to our table right when I was putting my last bite of food in my mouth & asked if any plates can be taken away. Ummm, I guess? I know it wasn't all that busy at the place but this was just over the top!",

The place was spotless and had a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere. Most of the breakfast combos run just under 10 bucks.  Cholula, Tapatio and Tabasco on every table--my kind of place. My omelette came with fresh mushrooms, not canned, which made me very happy. It was cooked perfectly, and the home fries were yummy.   Just two very minor things. My pancakes were a little tough, but still delicious. And the utensils were very thin. I felt like I was using a camping fork. But like I said, very minor.  I would definitely recommend giving this place a try for breakfast.",

I don't usually do this but i had just gotten coffee at a 'major coffee shop' when i decided i was hungry, so i stopped at Sunny's. When i sat at the counter i noticed the girl scowled a bit when she brought me a menu, i told her i had coffee but I'd like some water. As i looked at the menu apparently that server tagged another server to come and serve justice on me. She curtly barked at me \"I'm sorry but we don't allow outside drinks here!\" No 'hello' or anything... Not realizing i had two servers but quickly realizing that I'd been double-teamed i quietly said \"i guess I'll go eat some place else then.\" Come on Sunny's your food is good but not that good...and your coffee is definitely not up to par as other coffee places. And your servers well, they definitely need to be trained better in customer service, or replaced.",

They chatted with him while I would loudly call out to finally get their attention to get anything from coffee or water to even adding to my order (that's more money for you!). This was really annoying. Also an employee was sleeping in a booth. I've worked in restaurants since I was 14 and haven't seen that during regular business hours. Next to the sleeping server was her coworkers eating breakfast and chatting on cell phones. No one on the floor checking customers.  I'd heard this place had bad service but, since moving in next door, I thought I'd give it a chance and find a new breakfast place to bring friends and go before work. I'm not taking my family to a place with people sleeping in booths and waitresses more interested in how some dude's big day at the gym is going to be than a paying customer who works management and likes to tip but would fire this whole staff. Thanks for the check in the middle of eating so you could get back to breakfast and your phone. I put my credit card down and timed it on my phone to test the already bad service. Ten minutes to pick it up AND YOU GAVE IT TO A DIFFERENT PERSON!!! I was here for thirty minutes and a third of it was waiting for my card you gave to a stranger. Enjoy your rest. You won't see me again.   Follow up (Now one star): Asked a guy behind the counter if there was a manager and said there wasn't one but, \"What's the problem?\" I told him the sleeping server was a bad thing thing to have. His giggling response was, \"Huh huh, yeah...\" as if unprepared or hungover workers were the norm. Thanks, bro. Seriously, sleep in the closet. Hell, the walk-in. Don't do it right in the dining room. I'll be at work later where everyone is awake, cleaned up and ready to work or they're going home. I wish I went to McDonald's across the street. At least I can find the manager there.",

On to the restaurant  When we walked in the host immediately told us that they were on a wait with absolutely no line but multiple unclean tables.  It took our server a minute to come over but once he finally did, our order was taken. While we waited for our food for over an hour the server never stopped to fill our coffee, water or even to let us know what was going on. When I finally asked where our food was he said \"the kitchen is backed up but we're working on it.\"  The restaurant was less busy than when we first arrived.   As we waited other customers walked in, were seated around and received their food before us.  Once our food finally came out the server never came back to check on us.   The only reason that I'm giving this place 2 starts is because the food was good and the server did comp our bill.  However, the overall service in the restaurant leaves much to be desired.",

The menu is great and I knew I should've chosen something besides the meat lovers breakfast.  That's what i chose and here's what I received.  Eggs over medium were cooked perfect, home fries were very bland. The breakfast meats, bacon, sausage links and ham were extremely cheap low quality stuff, nothing special at all. To top it off I received a hard old biscuit and a side if gravy that I paid $1.79 extra for.  $2.49 coffee was good.  Service was good as well.  My gripe is food cost versus quality.  I paid $16.47 for what I know couldn't have cost them more than $3.  I don't mind paying more $$$ for quality, just didn't get it here today with what i ordered.",

    "text": "I've been eating here several times a week for the last couple of months, and have yet to have a bad dining experience!  Jessica is usually my server and she always has a smile and bright personality, and I usually have my food within 10 minutes of walking in.  The atmosphere is pleasant, it's nicer than the grease-shack diner you might expect in the campus area.  Very casual and open in design, the seats might not be luxury recliners but what do you expect.  Their breakfast specials are affordable ($2.99 for a typical diner 2-egg breakfast? Yes please!) and the food is tasty; perhaps nothing exceptional taste-wise but consistent excellence goes a long way in my book.  I'm fairly particular about my eggs and it's been difficult for me to find restaurants that won't occasionally either over- or under-cook my eggs.  When I'm not in the mood for breakfast, their chicken-fried steak hits the spot.  Frequently diners seem to over-season their gravy, particularly in the form of loading it up with pepper.  Sunny's doesn't, which I really appreciate; I think under-seasoning and letting the customer season to taste is a more practical approach for a diner, maybe it wouldn't fly for fine cuisine but that's not what we're here for, now is it.  There's a wide variety of menu options, from your standard diner omelettes, egg combos, sandwiches and steaks to several Greek and Italian options, and a good-sized array of salads and side orders.  Their sweet potato fries are fantastic!  Alex, the owner, is consistently approachable and friendly, I see him making a point to get to know all of his customers from the first minute they walk in the door, and he also works his tail off helping the other staff do their jobs, and I've seen him loading in supplies himself.  His family has been in the restaurant business in the valley for quite a few years, and the experience comes through in this diner.  They were responsible for Fast Eddie's, which had been my favourite Phoenix diner until I discovered this place.  I place a lot of value on good customer service and rapport, and their staff are always polite and engaging.  If you're looking for a clean, consistent diner with some menu variety and good prices, Sunny's is definitely a good choice.  Tell them Ben sent you!",

You will still find old items on the menu from the previous restaurant, but these items were the saving grace of this dining experience. As we entered the establishment we waited to be seated, and we were not greeted till for about five minutes. It wasn't till walking out the door that someone came up to is to offer us a table. So we decided to stay, and after we were sat we waited again for some server to come up to the table. Finally the server asked for our drink order, and when we came back she bolted away from the table. When she returned after a long delay we placed our order. The food came out quickly(thank the guys in back for that!). I ordered the Tex-Mex with chorizo which is an item from the old menu that they still have. Then my boyfriend ordered one of the gyros. The food was decent, but I was never asked if I wanted a coffee refill. It came to the point that I did the awkward cup shuffle. You know when you put your cup over to the side of the table, and hope that your server will see and refill your drink. Well it didn't happen, and our server didn't even return to ask how the food was. The server came back and it was only to drop off the check, and she bolted away again. As she bolted away I was trying to ask her for something and she didn't even return. We payed the bill and we left. There was no management that was running the establishment at all. The service and servers are horrible. Never again would we go here or recommend this place to anyone!",

It was cute like a classic diner with a modern college twist and way better food then your typical diner. My boyfriend ordered a French dip that was on special for $5.99! He loved it. I had a turkey club but almost got a skillet. Sandwich was good and according to our awesome friendly server the skillet was yummy too. Her name was Jessica and she was extremely helpful and personable. Also this place has a broad menu, serves breakfast all day, and literally has every side from sweet potato fries to a baked potato to jello and everything in between. Good prices, good service, good traditional diner food. Also the server informed us that the owner was a really good guy that \"ran things like they should be ran.\"  So we will be back for breakfast and recommend it for any meal of the day!",

    "text": "I am not often tempted to write a review or recommend a restaurant, but you have to try this place. Our first visit to Sunny's was because of a groupon, but breakfast was so good, we returned the very next day. Both meals were delicious, and the service was super. Today, we were reading the specials and planning a return strategy for visit number three! So tasty, try the gyros, moist and flavorful. i sincerely hope this place will be around for a long, long time.",

    "text": "I went here recently with my family and had the worst service of my life. We ordered our food and it took awhile for it to get out to us but they were extremely busy so we understood that. When we got our food everyone really liked it all. The food was great but the service was horrible. After not seeing our waitress for about 20 minutes we finally flagged down another server who informed us our waitress quit in the middle of her shift after an argument with the manager. No other server came around to fill our water cups and it really seemed like they were avoiding the side of the restaurant we were on completely. After about 30 minutes of sitting there we finally had someone fill up our water and then continued to wait another 10 minutes for the to go boxes we asked for.  When we got up to pay the person working the register completely ignored us so we left our check on the table. We could have very easily left the restaurant without paying at all.  I'll go back to a restaurant if I don't like the food because I can always order something different but I will not go back to a restaurant that has bad service.",

Also,  it is not appetizing to listen to a boss who was yelling at the wait staff... YOU COULDN'T PAY ME TO GO BACK THERE... waste of $20!",
