The food came out before the drinks and we didn't get waters until halfway through the meal. We got beef, chicken, and veggies. The beef was amazing, but the chicken was a nightmare. There was so much fat on the chicken and it was so thick there was no way to cook it all the way through. Although the beef was great my boyfriend found a small bone in the beef. Wish it was better. Won't be coming back.",

But the real star was our waiter Ryan, he deserves a huge raise. We asked for more rice, two bowls of rice were at our table in under 30 seconds (not exaggerating). He was regularly coming around to make sure our drinks were full and to take our next order, this is honestly the best service I've had at any restaurant! There was a nice vibe to the whole place. Oh the food was amazing too! I highly recommend the steak, it's prime cuts and super tender. I can't wait to go back.",

We ordered the Gen Premium Steak (meh), spicy pork bulgogi, Hawaiian steak, spicy chicken, gyoza, and the cheese pork cutlet (not good).  We liked most of our food, but it's fairly expensive if you're a light eater since you pay $25/person no matter what. Also, it was really loud and we couldn't figure out why. The music level was fine- maybe just the acoustics of the building? But our waiter couldn't hear us a couple times when we tried to grab him to order more food and we had trouble hearing each other over the noise. Over all it was fun to try but I doubt we will be back.",

My waiter was constantly busy with like maybe 6 other tables, it was hard to get his attention so I could get new orders of meat. Can't beat this price though. The Korean Fried Chicken is General Tso's chicken so don't waste your appetite on that or any type of fried chicken. The smokes garlic pork belly disappointed. The garlic calamari was very flavorful. Bulgogi was also good. Although the pineapples tasted like they were from can they helped provide the most flavor to the Hawaiian dishes. I recommend the Hawaiian beef steak, it cooked so well and tasted so good without any additional seasoning. If you try here, try to go not at peak times, the waiters have their hands full.",

I love KBBQ being a former Los Angeles native with my fair share of experiences at different AYCE KBBQ but this place has a way of making it unpleasant and undesirable. The service is slow and we came in here with a person in our party not feeling up to eating with us. He still agreed to join us for dinner because he wanted to spend time with us. Apparently they are strict on their \"head count policy\" and that is the biggest reason for the one star rating. Working in the food service industry, I can't possibly think of a reason why this hard to accommodate on a case by case basis. You really need to re-evaluate your customer service tactics. Being that both the manager and the assistant manager had a hard time understanding that one person wasn't eating thus there should be no expection/reason for a charge. Also kids are charged by height. So our 8 year old daughter was charged at $25 which is the standard adult price. That policy deserves a civil discrimination suit. Since when can you look at someone and just charge them what you feel is right based on their physical appearance?! Just because it's \"policy\" doesn't make it right nor legal.",

So understanding this came at 7:30 on a Sunday in hopes of being sat by 8:30 at latest. We came for my birthday and had 20 people and a infant and small child in tow. Continually the staff kept telling my husband and i and our guests 30 minutes. The initial said 1 hr to 1.5 hr wait.  When we checked at 9:30!(2 hrs later) the hostess kept saying 8 parties were ahead of us and another large party. I believe they were moving people in front of us. She told me not yo create a scene. The WORST HOSTESS EVER.  I told her to take us off the List. I was very mad, hungry, and disappointed. It literally was my birthday. She could have just decided to say we weren't going to eat there and we could have gone somewhere sooner.  We went next door to Kabuki. The manager let my large party get seated 20 minutes before close. Gave us free appetizers as her apology for another restaurants poor business practices.   So even if the food is good (wouldn't know).... the customer service is TERRIBLE... at Gen H. Once novelty wears off i doubt this will hang around if their customer service does not impress  Skip Gen Korean and go to Kabuki  Very Disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

We went there Saturday at 6:15 was told it would be 75 minute wait. Ok we shopped a bit and walked around but my daughter after an hour got hungry so we got her some pizza. After another 40 minutes of waiting we were seated looked at the menu and they wanted to charge 13 bucks just for my child to sit with us. Because of the long wait I had to feed her. It was a big deal we were set to leave but my friend convinced the manager it wasn't right.

It was a terrible experience.  I was with a semi large party and we wanted to be courteous and let them know that we had a large party coming in. As soon as we told them that and our party was enroute to meet us, they just kept telling us that they had to break our group up and that they wouldn't be able to seat us together. We ended up waiting an hour until we were seated.  Once we were seated, our waitress brought us some meats to cook and she would come back periodically to check on us. Then for about 15 minutes she was gone. We had track down someone to find her. I guess she was on break and someone who was filling in for us, put in our order for meat. After that, my sister asked him where the restroom was and he pointed in the direction and after that he says to my sister \"This was a mistake taking this section.\" And he proceeds to walk away...we found that to be rude and unprofessional to tell your customer you feel it was a mistake to take that section.",

My favorites are the KFC(to me the sauced one tastes like orange chicken, the one w/o sauce taste very flavorful too), spicy shrimp and beef bulgolgi! Everyone loved the gyoza and the spicy octopus was just a little too spicy.  Monday afternoon, no wait. Our waiter was super attentive but not overly, personable and always came at the right time when we needed refills or to make another order. Perfect service.  Friday night, was told it would be 30 mins-1hr and a half wait but they would text us when a table is available. Luckily it was only a 30 min wait.  Once we get to our table we place our order for drinks and it takes about 20 mins for her to get back with them. We place our 1st order which comes out quickly.   Honestly after that the service went down hill. Each order, refill for drinks or rice and asking for napkins always took more than 10mins for her to do. We would usually be sitting there looking at empty plates and a grill and another server or the manager would come by to ask if we needed anything and we always said yes.   The Friday night service just definitely wasn't a great experience compared to my afternoon one.  After we ate we asked for dessert and the check. The strawberry macaroon ice cream sandwich was delicious.  She comes back 15 mins later with mixed up receipts so she has to go back and fix them.  10 mins after that the hostess gives us our receipts and wishes us a good night.   It just left us feeling a little grumpy in the end when we were there for a birthday.",

    "text": "Korean Food is and its flavors are nearly ubiquitous.  Gochujang (spicy, sweet fermented chili paste) can now be found in grocery stores nearly everywhere and even on the shelves at Target.  This savory, earthy, spiced \"condiment\" is the basis of many tasty Korean dishes including the venerable, and healthy, food known as Kimchi and is being incorporated into everything from fine-dining fusion dishes to snack foods.  It is so versatile that it is even used in many Korean marinades and sauces, including some of the tasty meats and sides served at Gen Korean BBQ House.   Rightly so, Korean food is spicy, sweet, savory, crunchy, crispy, salty and full of umami - all things that satiate today's palate.  Combine all of these flavors with the carnal sounds of grilling, the smell of caramelizing meat and the earthy smoke of grilled protein and vegetables over a gas flame, right in front of you, at your table, and you have Korean BBQ.  How do you turn it up a notch?  Make it all you can eat!  How do you catch the attention of the general public and make them want more?  Use quality ingredients; provide prompt, knowledgeable and friendly service in a colorful, comfortable and inviting atmosphere.  The fun of trying new flavors, interacting with, and cooking your own food, creates such a memorable experience that you leave making plans to return before you have even left the parking lot.  Because of its all you can eat nature, ordering off the menu is as simple as choosing four items at a time (typically numbers 1-20 on the lunch menu, 1-24 on the dinner menu) and then choosing as many items in the lower half of the menu as you want.  Gen BBQ does the chopping, dicing, marinating and saucing for you so your order comes from the kitchen quickly, and ready to grill.  Delicious ready-to-eat choices are K.F.C., Goyza, Cajun Chicken and Volcano Chicken.  Essential with every order of uncooked proteins are #25, mushrooms and vegetables, and #28 Jap Chae (Glass Noodles).  Banchan (Kimchi, marinated cucumber, mashed potato, edamame, cabbage slaw, radish, marinated onion) and a green salad (chopped romaine with a sesame soy dressing) included with every meal, are also endless and served immediately after placing your order (sometimes before).  Once your meats are grilled and on your plate, hail your server, ask questions and repeat the process.    You only have two hours to consume all you can . . . do it right, and in no time you will be in your own euphoric protein stupor, rolling out the door, wondering who was the first person to say, \"Hey, Bulgogi and Galbi are so delicious, what if I could eat them, and twenty other Korean favorites, for hours and hours?\"  Apparently, the geniuses that started Gen Korean BBQ House thought this and replicated it over and over.   Fine dining restaurants often call themselves intimate.  Restaurants with a breathtaking view or scenic location call themselves intimate.  Small, quiet, dimly lit restaurants also call themselves intimate.  However, Korean BBQ redefines intimacy because it allows you to interact with your food, tend to it, and cook it just the way you like it.  Dining at Gen Korean BBQ House brings a higher level of appreciation to the food served and seems to elevate the taste and flavors in every bite.  And it does all of this at a reasonable price, in comfortable surroundings, with great service and an experience that never leaves you wanting more.  And yes, there is alcohol and dessert too!  Moderation, is a good thing . . .  sometimes   Overall: 4.7 Quality: 4.6 Service: 4.5 Cleanliness: 5 Value: 4.5 Atmosphere: 4.8",

The service was pretty good though, they come through and change out the grill plate regularly, which is nice.  Since I am not a huge meat eater, I wouldn't frequent this place often; however, if you like Korean seasoned meats, I definitely would recommend this place.  They do offer some prepared foods that you can order off the menu as well like jap chae and KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), which is part of the AYCE.  The music is a bit loud, which makes it hard if you are here for good conversation with friends, etc...  But the place is beautifully decorated and clean.",

    "text": "I don't know a lot about Korean BBQ or really anything about Korean culture but I do know that Gen is so delicious! I don't eat seafood so I won't be able to tell you about their fish or anything but their pork, steak, and chicken are so incredibly delicious! My favorite FOR SURE is the volcano chicken! It is VERY spicy though, they aren't kidding when they say extremely hot. Their fried dumpling things are also very delicious too. (I forgot what exactly they call them here..) The little salad that comes with your food is actually super yummy as well. Their soju is super yummy as well. When my friends and I go they always get the cajun shrimp and baby octopus. Just make sure to eat all of your food so you won't be charged the extra $5!! I've never had to wait here and I've came during lunch and dinner times. Perhaps I've just been lucky! Service has always been great and I've never had a problem ordering more plates. Waiters and waitresses have always been so sweet, pleasant, and attentive. Definitely my favorite Korean place here! It's the only one that hasn't given me food poisoning!",

The menu is basically a selection of different cuts of meat that you can get your grub down on its pretty straight forward.  If you're a picky eater you should go travel the world more because this place offers some items that could upset your sensitive palate hahaha!!!!  The server was on point but an introduction to the items along with the process could've been helpful but we gunned forward to just eat and enjoy.  We went on a Wednesday night and it was FREAKING PACKED.  The music plus the capacity of the restaurant made it seem loud but it was energetic and worth the experience.  You are charged for food you don't eat but for $25 all you can eat, just bring your appetite and be ready to leave full!a",

Went during happy hour on Friday and the beer was half off plus we got seated immediately. Everything we tried was wonderful including the octopus. They will bring you extra rice  if you ask and it's a good idea to plan all the 4 items you will request each time to keep them coming. Each platter serves about 4 people so if you have more than 4 to your party, I would suggest ordering 2 of each dish. Will bring extra kitchen scissors and tongs for everyone on our next visit so we can all interact with the cooking.",

After we voiced our concerns management made it seemed like we were being unreasonable. Uh no, if we asked for a table for 6 then logically we want to be seated together. 2) The service was awful. I'm talking about one napkin per person, 20+ minutes for bowls of rice to arrive, no refills on either water or soda.  Had this restaurant been a hole in the wall, I would have expected the service to be awful. But it wasn't. It was in a location where the service in the surrounding restaurant is generally ok. I would def not recommend this location.",

She made the experience 10x more enjoyable than normal (went to Gen in LA). Also all the employees were really nice, they kept asking us if we needed anything or if we wanted to change the grill. Now to preface this I am a very harsh reviewer so a 4 star is already a lot. Without the awesome service this would probably be a 2 star on food alone. The food was alright, there may seem like a lot of selection but most of them are trash or just repeats of the same meat but with a different marinate on it. The grill cooked unevenly so we could only basically cook one thing at a time (Until a server called David showed up to teach us how to use the grill but still i like it to evenly distribute heat).  The Korean fried chicken was pretty lit tho, I suggest getting at least 1 order of that. Oh and the Kimchi!  To summarize:  Service: 5/5 Food:     2/5 Overall:  4/5",

This is a place where you have to cook your own food and that is what makes it fun!  They have a large quantities of items that you can cook and the food is so mmmmm....mmmm....mmmmm GOOD!  They also have a bar area that people can chill at if there's a wait time for your table.  I recommend getting the short-rib dish, that's my favorite dish there.  The workers there are friendly and my server, Phil, is excellent!  Phil came by every 10 mins to make sure if we needed anything else and it was a great time having him serving us.  The guy has a great sense of humor and knew how to make our party laugh each time he came back around.  There were items on the menu I wasn't familiar with and I asked Phil what they were and he took his time to explain to us what is what.   Overall, this place is great!  Love the service!",

You get a large number of options and the best part is it's all you can eat in a span of 2 hours. If you need a little break from all the grilled meat, you can order some other great options like gyoza, Korean fried chicken (KFC) and jap chae (glass noodles). My go to meats are the brisket, which is really thin so it cooks quickly and you can season it to your liking. I also like the galbi as well as the premium steak but I haven't had anything that I don't like here so far. One thing to keep in mind is If you're coming here for dinner on a weekend, be prepared to wait at least an hour.",

Put in our order within less than 10 mins and the meat started rolling out for the grill instantly! This place is AYCE. They give you a 2 hr limit & you can order up to 4 dishes at a time.  The spicy pork belly is to die for! So flavorful & wasnt actually too spicy. For me at least. You can never go wrong with beef short ribs! Those were marinated to perfection. They have a few chicken selections to throw on the grill, but in my opinion, I would avoid them. We ordered the Hawaiian chicken. It was okay. A little on the plain side, I def wouldn't order it again. Came with a pineapple slice thought which was really neat. Baby octopus as well. Heavily marinated in pepper paste sauce. It was okay, nothing amazing about it but it was still good. Same for the cajun shrimp. The best things to grill up are the beef & pork options, imo!  They have a few off grill items that are really good as well. The japchae was a must for me. & I was so so excited about the fact that they has KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) on their menu. Nice and tangy. They're like little fried boneless nuggets of meat covered in the sauce. & of course I had to try out the volcano chicken, which is the same as KFC but spicy. Be careful with this one If you can not handle spice because it definitely does pack a punch. You can always order half the portion if you just want to sample it.   As I mentioned, you can order up to 4 dishes at a time. & you can ask for a new grill plate each time you put in another order! They have a few side dishes, not sure if they are unlimited or not because I never asked but you can get as much rice as you'd like.",

    "text": "By far one of the best in value KBBQ I've ever been to.  @ $24.99 per person for AYCE for 2 hrs is nothing to write home about. But at that price for the amount of entrees you can choose from is beyond awesome.  There were over 20 different type of meats, veggies, and snack items to choose from.  We tried pretty much everything on the menu and everything tasted delicious.  Only caveat to the whole situation is that they only allow you to order 4 dishes at a time.  For us it was perfect because between 2 people, it gave us a good flow of food coming and allowed us to eat at a reasonable pace.    Atmosphere in here felt like I was eating in the middle of a night club.  It was very different but in a good way.  KBBQ to me is a meal you eat while hanging out with friends and this was definitely a nice place to chill and eat with friends or family.  The blue lights all over gave this place a relaxing ambiance with the music blasting in the background and sports playing on the TV at the bar, it was a nice combo that is sure to please anyone coming to the establishment.They do offer wine, beer, and liquor here which was nice.   If everything was so great, why didn't we give this place a 5*.  First off, there were only about 7 side dishes.  I'm a huge fan of KBBQ for their side dishes and it was kind of a let down to see such a nice meal go with so few side dishes.  Some of my favorite items like the fish cake wasn't even available.  Second, there were no sauces.  We didn't ask for any but for sure there were none at the table and none was made available when they were setting up.  All we got upon sitting was a place with some seasoning salts.  The meats themselves were not dry by any means but it would have been nice to have some type of dipping sauce to curb all the salty and sweet marinate of the meats.  Wait time was about an hr so make sure to make reservations if you plan to bring a big party.  Overall I was very please with my meal and what It cost and the variety of foods I had to choose from.  OH AND YES!! GYOZA was part of the meal and you can get as much as you'd like.  Happy eating.",

    "text": "I've had this place bookmarked and wondered what the big deal about this place is? My sister wanted to celebrate my mom's birthday here. So we had 12 people. Oh yea, no reservations allowed. Just put you name in and wait. I don't really like this concept but understand. It's and all you can eat for two hours.   So my sister got there early, put our name in and only had to wait 30 minutes on a Saturday night. No large tables but two booths for six each.   So you cook your own food over your table grill and you can only order four dishes at a time. Let's see we had Korean fried chicken, gyoza, Beef bulgogi, steak, beef ribs, beef tongue, garlic chicken, shrimp, octopus, calamari and others stuff. Most of it is cut fairly thin so it cooks fairly quickly. All is pretty good but would have to say that everyone liked the beef ribs the best.   Someone came back all the time and had to change our grill three times because the grill gets pretty dirty after awhile.   To be honest, I don't remember our server because they were always running around. Everyone is always ordering dishes. They take your orders and off they go. Water glasses we filled somewhat okay but the server we had wasn't the same person helping us at the end. I felt like we had thee different serving by the end of our meal. So as you can tell not friendly service but they are trying to fill everyone's order. Fast service and not friendliness is their game.   The place is pretty good I would say. This is a Korean all you can eat so lots of people are always waiting in line. When there are lots of asian's waiting then you know it's a good Asian restaurant (trying to not be prejudiced but honest).  So be ready to wait. You got two hours to eat and eat til you're content cause for dinner it's basically $25 a person. Not friendly service but quick service is there game. Really good food and a great ambiance. Fairly dark with blue lights and a fairly loud environment. Had a good time and wouldn't mind coming back. Enjoy we did.",

It's more beneficial to eat with a group of four since you can try a little bit of everything. You order four dishes at a time with a two hour limit. Anything you don't finish, you will be charged per plate. I suggest getting the yogurt soda to wash down your food. Also, don't forget to ask for rice paper to eat your meats with. Gen Korea BBQ House is legit. I rather come here for dinner than lunch since they have better entrees.  The restaurant is clean, the staff is prompt  and knowledgable, and I can see why they have become so popular. They run like a well oiled machine. Gen comes highly recommended.",

    "text": "We had prepped our body to consume the all you can eat Korean bbq by coming hungry and with a strong mind. We put our name in for a table of 5+ on a Sunday at 1pm. Their texting system allows you to walk around Tempe Marketplace while you wait for your table. After letting the hostess know that our stomach was literally eating ourselves, some of us were starting to get hangry and ready to bail. We even contemplated sending our doctor friend to tell the staff that one of us has hypoglycemia and needed to eat STAT. We were finally seated at 3pm, a two hour wait.  The vibe was confusingly awesome. With the movie Hook playing on their big screen, clerbbb music jamming loudly, and a classy ambiance, I didn't know where to put my attention... Until our food came.   If you haven't been to an all you can eat kbbq before, you're in for a treat. It's mainly meat but they have a few other selections like Japchae (rice noodles) and dumplings you can order. They will bring raw meat to the table and you cook it on a hot plate. Using scissors, you cut up the meat to bite size and serve yourselves.   They have \"four orders at a time\" rule, so we immediately asked for our four orders right when we sat down. When the food came, our instant regret was not turning on the hot plate ahead of time so we can eat sooner. We nommed on the kimchi, sweet mashed potatoes, and other Korean complimentary side dishes while the meat was cooking. We got the routine down that whenever the new item arrives, we order our next four because we knew that the 2hour limit was going to be more of a sprinting marathon. They were well staffed and changed our hot plates at least 5 times. Some of our faves were the garlic pork belly, cow tongue, and galbi. Their meat was good quality and well marinated - no other place like this in the valley.   We ended up ordering 34 orders between the 6 of us, so we challenge you to eat more than us! Overall, I won't fault them for being popular and the experience was super worth it for their dinner price ($25).  Protip: Show up before 11am to limit wait time. They don't take reservations.",

The first time we couldn't get in because the wait was 2.5 hours. It was at 730 on a Wednesday when we got there. The second time, we decided to try to beat the crowd and went there at # on a Sunday to get a table at 5pm! So we lucked out and sat down at 530.  I think they just got their liquor license that day. I recommend the Lychee martini or the Mai Tai! They were sooo good! I love this all you can eat BBQ place because the staff are very attentive. We only encountered one snag where our server went on break and never came back, but luckily, another server picked up the slack.  You order 4 menu items at a time, and they bring it out right away. We tried mostly all of the choices. My favorites, The premium steak, and the smoked pork belly!!! OMG! so delicious! my least favorite was probably the red wine pork belly. It just didn't appeal to me.",

Hey, I recognize that chain - \"Gen Korean BBQ\", the dance club music , modern, new - only a month old, Korean BBQ restaurant staffed by young, hip, 20 somethings.  For those concerned with smelling like BBQ after eating, you still will, but not as bad as the old style Korean BBQ joints with overhanging exhaust hoods.  At Gen, the BBQ smoke is sucked away through the vent in the grill thus the place is not hazy with smoke.  You cook everything yourself, thus a lot of time for talking and saying Whassup?  What to eat for $15.99 of the possible 32 items or $24.99 of the possible 37 items in two hours at 4 plates per order (4 limit plate per order)?  Eat it all like the pudgy NK Dictator would do!  Your server can provide suggestions and did.  Jan ( a cool guy not to be confused with a KPop girl) did a great job, keeping our protein supply going.  Had 3 rounds or 12 plates among the three of us with three changes of the grill.  All within 2 hours...actually only one and half hours as we were stuffed.  Conceptually, a table for four would be the perfect size as you could easily manage grilling 4 orders or 16 plates in two hours.  Liked it all especially with the sesame & salt paste.  We have had KBBQ many times before but had Pork Jowl and Garlic Squid for the first time.  Nice... We ordered Jowl again in the last round since we liked it so much.  The other items were great also.  Beef Steak, Pork Belly, Bulgoki, etc.. Get it all, eat it all, and expand the waist line....",

We sat down and Amanda our waitress was there to explain our menu and options. She told us we had 2 hour limit and could order 4 items at a time.  We started with Gen Premium Steak, Garlic Calamari, Gen Beef Bulgogi and Mushrooms & Vegetables. Then continued and ordered Gen Chadol, Premium Pork Belly, Garlic Chicken, Mushrooms & Vegetables, Shrimp, Galbi and Gen Chadol Brisket.  Of all the items my favorite was the Gen Beef Bulgogi which has a nice marinated sauce that makes the beef outstanding.  The service was very good with Amanda taking care of our table with drinks and quickly bringing our orders of meats and other items on her tablet.  The seating portion was kind of a snafu, but after that everything else was pretty good.  The restaurant is located at Tempe Marketplace behind Barnes and Noble.",

First, I wanna say that our waitress Ejin was so sweet! She was working her tail off and I forced her to sit down when she took our order because, oh man, she had to have been exhausted!    So anyways, place was great. We ate so much meat! Some of our favorites were the baby octopuses, the beef tongue, brisket, and the red wine pork belly. The meats are the kind you expect at other AYCE places in California and Las Vegas where the meat comes to your table curled and ready for grilling. At one point, the pretty manager came by and cut up our meat and helped us grill once we all got to the point where we were meat-drunk. Like we were literally laughing over the dumbest things. Oh, and get the rice paper with your meat, people. Dinner is $25/pp and I think lunch is $15/pp. If you don't finish your food, it's like $4 or $5 per plate so don't waste food, guys! You order four dishes at a time to help avoid wasting food. You have a two hour limit.  Service was prompt. They changed out the grill very frequently and always made sure everything was refilled. So yeah, it was a great dinner with some of my most favorite people! We will definitely be back again!",

However, my recent visit here was very upsetting that I just had to write it up. One reason why I eat here a lot is because I have some friends who work here. It so happened that this recent visit, we decided to go eat after her shift ended. So this visit took place March 23rd between 5:30pm to 7:30pm. Our initial server was Amanda. I say \"initial\" because she was our server at the very beginning of our meal but disappeared after a short period of time. As I was the first one to be seated, awaiting for my friends to come (there was four of us, two who happen to be servers of Gen), Amanda came by to me to introduced herself and to get orders. I only asked for waters and for some time for my friends to come. After my friends arrived, we waited for her return to our table. As she was getting our first orders in, she was very hasty with us and left quickly; we were only able to get two meat orders in, which was very surprising to me (and my friends) because every time I come to eat, the servers usually allow me four meat orders, she didn't ask if we were done ordering or if we needed anything else. No big deal, we were still trying to get situated into our meal. However as time passed, she was really occupied with her other tables and would only glance over at our table but never fully come in close proximity of us. One other server noticed our lack of service (he happened to be a friend to my friends) and was very helpful in assuring that we were getting our orders in. Watching him, he was quick with his tables and would walk by ours and ask if we needed anything. During this time, our initial server was no where to be found. We were briefly informed by ANOTHER server that she went on a break??? Which made sense, but I don't know how long the breaks are at Gen but she didn't come back for a while. At this time, the male server came back to check on us, put our orders in, changed our grills, all while our server was on break. However, I noticed that she was back to serving tables, just not our table. At this moment, my friends and I were like \"whatever, can he be our server instead?\" Which was the case because she finally came by to ask if we needed anything but we were already helped at that moment. Again, she did not come to check on our table or put any further orders in for the rest of our meal. I don't know if she felt that we were getting served well by her and that we didn't need anything or if she thought that since we had other servers helping us, she didn't need to do anything, but things began to get complicated when we tried asking if the male server could just take over our table and serve us (because that was literally what he was doing).  This is where things got complicated. We heard from our male server that our initial server, Amanda, was complaining about us \"taking and giving\" her table way to our male server. Which was not the case whatsoever. It was surprising to us as she made no effort to serve us at all. As customers (Judy and I), we didn't want our friends and our male server to get in trouble for \"taking and giving away tables,\" so we decided to try to clear things up by speaking to the floor manager or assistant manager, Chip (if I remember his name correctly). THIS. IS. WHERE. THINGS. GOT. UNPROFESSIONAL. As he sat down, he was calm and collective and seemed to be open to hearing what we, as customers, would have to say. However, once we began to express our concerns about wanting to tip our male server over Amanda, he began to speak to us in an abrupt and impolite manner. We were unable to further express our concerns because he was interrupting us, constantly telling us that he was unable to switch the table over to our male server and that our server is Amanda. Which we totally understand but regarding tips, we wanted to inform him on why we were going to be tipping our male server instead of Amanda. Instead, he came at us in such an insolent, unprofessional tone, telling us that he \"doesn't care\" and that what we did as customers was not \"right.\" Well, Chip. As a customer with feedback of the employees of your work place, that you manage, I felt that you did not handle our concerns in a professional manner. I really hope Chip improves this skill set, he has as he is in a high position to be overseeing such a critical aspect of the service industry. Regardless of my two other friends who work here, he had no right to speak to Judy and I in a ill-manner. With that being said, I hope to see a change in the customer service area regarding concerns and complaints because I would really love to continue coming here with a peace of mind.",

    "text": "Prior to Gen, the All You Can Eat Korean BBQ scene was non-existent. There were a few Korean BBQ places that sold a la carte meat dishes but you end up spending like $70 or more for two people. Some restaurants tested out their AYCE, but their selection was mediocre at best with few choices and often slow/terrible service. Now... redemption has come!  Tuesday night on 9/12/2017 was their first soft opening night. There was no line and we were seated right away. Our server David was awesome! In fact, we had about 5 people helping us out. Three hostess kept coming by to make sure we had what we needed, and if we didn't, they would get David for us. And two other staff came to change our grill plates very often. And if they didn't come, one of the hostess that kept coming to our table got someone to change our grill plate. David and the hostesses came by so often we had trouble keeping up with ordering our food because our orders kept coming fast. That's what I called EXCELLENT SERVICE.  The food was so delicious. We were able to order about 17 items within the 2 hour limit we had. I highly recommend the bulgogi and Hawaiian pork belly and beef tongue. I personally felt the the meat quality for all items ordered was very good. You can tell by the color and the texture of the meats. The marinated flavored meats were excellent. It blew me away because it tasted really good~! Even compared to KBBQ places in LA, I thought this Gen location surpassed them in service, flavor, variety and quality.  I don't know if they overstaffed themselves for the soft open, but this was one of the best Korean BBQ experiences I had. I hope they keep their staffing level like this for the future. The place was clean, the staff was great (friendly and fast), and the food was high quality with delicious flavors. If anything, I would suggest they put steamed egg on their menu, since I usually order that when I go to AYCE KBBQ, and they can improve their side dishes by making them bigger. BUT THE SIDE DISHES DIDN'T MATTER! Because our meats came out so fast and kept coming, I didn't have time to even really eat the sides dishes. LOL. Well played, Gen KBBQ. Well played.",

We have been sitting here for 10 mins and they aren't cleaning any tables that can be sat at but cleaning the closed section for the night. Workers are just standing around talking instead of working. Very disappointing walked to the bathroom and there was over 5 dirty tables",

    "text": "The best AYCE Kbbq in Arizona. Came here on the first day it opened. If you've never done AYCE kbbq, it's worth a try. It's similar to a Brazilian steakhouse, except you are brought raw meat that you grill yourself at the table.   For my experience this time specifically, the wait staff was still being trained and it was apparent, but overall the service was decent. If you've been to other Gen Kbbq places in California you can expect similar experiences here. They didn't have the traditional Korean Barley tea or Steamed Egg, not sure if it's just an opening night thing or permanent. Dessert and drinks are separate and not included in the price. For dinner it's $24.99/person which pretty standard for a place like this, however was expecting it to be a little cheaper since it's Arizona. A note, if you leave too much meat leftover and uneaten, you'll be charged an additional fee, so make sure you're able to finish what you order. This fee is also standard among most kbbq, places to eliminate waste.  The meats were all very good, we tried almost everything on the menu and we didn't have a bad choice. The side dishes were very standard, potatoes, pickled vegetables, rice paper, Korean salad, etc. You can ask for as much as you want of these as well. Rice is included is desired.  Overall it was a good food experience, comparable to the other kbbq experiences I've had in California and other parts of the world. I'd recommend you try it at least once if you haven't had kbbq before. I knocked out down one star for service, very disorganized and got our order wrong a few times. However, it was an unofficial opening and were still training, so I didn't have too high of expectations.",

I USUALLY love the food, even if it takes a minimum of two hours to get in.  Tonight, being a special occasion that we saved up for again, the food was so bad we couldn't even eat it.  We tried a little bit of everything and all was disappointing. we ended up leaving and eating somewhere else.  Definitely NOT worth the $25/person.  They don't have rice paper or seaweed salad, which is the best way to wrap the meat in my opinion.  There was no wait time and I should have taken that as a sign that the place went downhill.  i don't know if management changed, but this is NOT the same place as it used to be.  All thumbs DOWN.  You lost a good customer Gen!",

The service wasn't bad here, server came around often and was easy to flag down and knew the menu well.  The food was ok. Some items were great tasting others were blah. They don't give out many side dishes but if you ask for more of a dish they will give you a big bowl of it. The kimchi did taste great!  We tried the beef brisket, the spicy pork bulgogi, cajun calamari, soondoboo, gyoza, volcano chicken, shrimp, and spicy baby octopus.   I personally ate the beef brisket, which I cooked well done, not hard to do since so thinly sliced, and the calamari which was well cooked as it shriveled up and became rubbery and didn't taste that good, as well as their potatoe salad which i ate a lot of and soondoboo which I had a couple of spoon fills because it just didn't taste right and was too oily. Between one of those four items, I got some horrible food poisoning. This was the only food I had eaten that day as we went for a late lunch and around 2am I woke up with horrible stomach pains and was throwing up like crazy. 2 days later I am still sick with food poisoning.

She was began a huge argument shouting at one of the servers, saying that \"it's not my FUCKING JOB\" or something, which triggered another server to yell back. I have loved the service every time I have been to Gen, but I did not appreciate the low level of respect for customers Kris displayed that day. Had she not started the argument, none of this would have happened. I hope she is dealt with by the management.",

    "text": "My friends and I went there a few days ago for lunch. Our waiter was a young man named Ian, we asked for waters and my friend (who had never tried Korean BBQ) asked for a fork. Ian responded by being extremely rude and telling her if she really wanted that she'd have to go in the back of the restaurant to take a picture on the hall of fame. It took over 10 mins to get the first few plates and we still had yet to receive our waters. Everything we ordered, we had to order twice because he kept forgetting about us. A very kind woman who was delivering food asked if we wanted another salad in front of him, and he snapped at us. This experience was topped off with the changing of the grill. When he came to change the grill (10 mins after we had originally asked), he didn't bring the typically used tray that held both the new and old grills. He brought nothing but one new tray (which I believe is a huge safety concern). When he went to switch out the trays, his hand slipped and the old grill got knocked off the table, dumping our food and sauces inside the grill and all over us. He barely apologize to us for this and came back with 3 small napkins to dab small amounts of spill that he saw. In my opinion, the manager should've come checked on us or even another employee. We should've received a discount and been moved to another table to finish our dining experience. But no, we had to continue to try and cook with a sopping wet table. None of us will be returning after this experience. I expected much better customer service.",

We has to wait a while and order and remind the waiters couple times for it to come out but the flavor is not there (compared with California). Unfortunately they r out of beef bulgogi as well so we couldn't try it. Other than that, the waiters are super nice and friendly. We got our cooking tray changed couple times since it got burnt fast. Consider the store is just newly opened there are still hiccups here and there but overall i m happy with my dinner so 4 stars it is!!!",

Tempe water in general is very bad.  They could get some kind of filtration system I guess, but it is still not worth knocking them down a star.  We went for Sunday lunch and had to wait about 50 minutes to get seated because they were so busy.  They were up front about it though, which is why I still give them 5 stars.  Also, on the weekends, it is about $25 per person because the lunch menu is only during the week for about $17.  Overall it is really good and you don't feel rushed or anything.",

First of all the food is good (or a 5 would obviously be out of the question) but in addition the way in which you cook it is unique and fun (if you're up for it). Cooking your own food on a grill at your table has it's benefits which are that you can cook it to your liking plus you don't have to wait for a server or kitchen staff to prepare it. You can eat ASAP ! They have a all you can eat option which is a great deal and you will absolutely get full before the 2 hour time limit is up ! The all you can eat menu is HUGE you feel spoiled getting to try so many different kinds of meat, noodles, gyoza etc in one sitting.  The service is good too and they make sure they get you nice and full fast ! The only downside is sometimes they don't clear dishes fast enough so the table gets crowded. Also a caution- they don't take reservations but you can put your name in and grab a drink nearby which is convenient.",

I was excited to get some KBBQ and was stoked they opened a location in AZ (Tempe).  Ordered all my favorites: brisket (go-to always), beef tongue, galbi, pork belly, and some japchae on the side.  The reason for the rating has nothing to do with the service but the inconsistencies I found at this location.    If you know, you know...I asked the waiter if I could get a couple of secret sauces for me and my friend to go with our KBBQ.  The waiter said, \"Sorry man we don't do that here...the GM has actually threatened to write us up for making it for customers.\"   When he said this I told him right away, \"no worries, man.\"  But, if you've ever been to a GEN in CA, you'd know the secret sauce is a staple!  And any of the workers would be happy to provide it for you.  I proceeded to ask if I could also get a stack of rice paper...waiter said the same thing...sorry, we don't do that here man.  What kind of KBBQ place doesn't have rice paper...like dafuq?!  It's small shit but makes me sad I couldn't get the same experience I know GEN provides in CA...also, side observation, none of the waitstaff or workers wore name tags.  Also, brisket was meh...both orders came out in thick slices...after cooking result was like eating rubber.    Japchae too...tasted literally like nothing.  It's supposed to be a fine balance between sweet and savory, not nothing and nothing.  No flavor whatsoever.   My friend tried ordering sliced daikon (radish)...again, if you know, you know.  The waiter had the hardest time trying to understand. GEN Tempe, train your waitstaff yo!  I love GEN but idk if I'll come back to this one...lack of quality control and consistency.",

The grilling on your own concept kinda sucks here though.  We go out cause we dont wanna cook.  Call it lazy but its really just preference.  Plus something about cooking your own $50+ meal seems absurd.  One note...if you order the volcano chicken prepare to sweat...you've been warned.",

    "text": "I would probably rate this at a 3.5 if that was an option. It is a very cool concept. You order your meal and they bring out the uncooked protein. You put it on a grill and cook it yourself. Definitely some stress making sure the chicken was cooked all the way. Lunch was 17 dollars. All you can eat with a 2 hour limit  They will bring up to four items out at a time. They will also bring half orders of items out if you ask. Probably not a bad idea considering that the full orders are a lot of food. There are no carry outs at all so eat what you cook or you have to leave it. The service was outstanding. It is a very clean establishment. The menu is very interesting and is probably is worth trying just for the experience.",

Server acted uninterested in us from the start.  He was a poor server in general but was completely over sat and was running around frantic.  All of the food tasted bland and lacked unique flavor.  First round of 4 options came out, one plate was missing.  It arrived when the second round came out.  The second round had a plate of the wrong kind.  The food runner brought us food we did not order on two separate occasions. Our rice was delivered last, after the second round had already been on the grill for a long time. Staff overall did not seem to care much about anyone's experience. We expressed our concerns with the manager before leaving but he seemed disinterested in what we had to say.  We left early and will never return.",

We proceed to look at the menu and start getting ready to order.  Then the hostess who seated us has returned and asked us to get up because the table was reserved for another party and our wait would be an hour.  I had called at 5 and they had confirmed they do not take reservations,  so this is all news to us.  We didnt know what to do as this was very rude and unexpected.    The restaurant management and hostess desk should have resolved this mix up as it is their mistake.  The lack of response from the manager was insulting as a customer.  He offered us to wait the hour+ and discount 2 plates.  I would have like to see them resolve the issue and find a training opportunity for their staff.  This is disappointing and wont return.  I prefer better customer service when choosing establishments.",

Would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try.  The bulgogi was so flavorful and yummy (both the beef and the pork).  I also liked that they had some precooked items on the menu to request, as well.  It was clean and staff was friendly.  The only reason I gave it a 4 was because I felt that the server could have done a better job of explaining everything to us, as it was our first visit.  There are several small dishes of food on the table when you are sat and she did not tell us what anything was until I asked.  She also didn't discuss cooking times or give us tongs to cook with (we had to ask). But overall, definitely somewhere I would return to eat again.",

I probably come here twice a month, but it's been getting busier lately so can't get in so easily anymore.   I love their salad and potato salad.

A lot of the Korean barbecue places I go to are not \"general public friendly\". They are authentic, but that doesn't lend itself to a great business meeting or dinner out with my wife. I am a huge Korean barbecue fan, and so I try any new one in or around me. I believe I have been to every one in the Phoenix area.  This place is all you can eat, they do make sure you understand the rules and tend to repeat them a lot. Don't order a bunch of food and not eat it, or they will charge you for it.  This place is the biggest Korean barbecue restaurant I have ever been in. And they have a line on Fridays and Saturdays that is two hours long. I recommend going for lunch and getting there around 1130. You'll get seated right away, get a little bit better prices, and have the same good food. Lunch service is fast, and they do check up on you regularly to make sure you're not waiting for more items.  The servers are nice and efficient. The food is good, although some of the meat selections are less flavorful then other places in the valley.    Overall this is highly recommended for both the Korean barbecue aficionados as well as beginners. The only drawback is the sides they bring including kimchi are small to start and you have to ask for refills quite often. They also have a much smaller selection of sides then most of the other places I've been.",

    "text": "This review is for those of you that want to \"check out\" Korean BBQ...  As you read, know that this lunch on Saturday cost two of us $72 and we did not order any alcohol. It's $25 per person plus around $10 for two Cokes and we left a tip of $10. We did not break any of the rules so no additional charges (yes, you can incur financial penalties...read on). A very, very expensive meal.  Admittedly, I am not a Korean BBQ expert. In fact, I had never had it. I have traveled the world and experienced plenty of unusual food. We hadn't made it to Korea yet. We go to Kabuki all the time and when Gen showed up, we were very curious. We had stopped by this place the week earlier and the wait was just too long. Today, we happened to get there later and the wait was only 15 minutes.   Great atmosphere - very cool physical space. Love the high tech system of texting you when your table is ready. The hostess was really cool and when I told her we had never been, she gave us the run down. The waiter followed with the same run down. Both included the contract we had just entered into (aka \"the rules\").  I'll just cut to the chase. I would sum up this place as dining under an authoritarian regime in a foreign country.  CHICKEN MUST BE COOKED TO 165 DEGREES....  You order food by number from a list of roughly 37 options and they bring you the raw meats to cook at your table. Neat idea but you better have a reasonable understanding of how much meat, chicken, and seafood needs to be cooked to be safe to eat. You know that warning you see everywhere about how eating undercooked meats can cause foodborne illness? Well, this is exactly what they are talking about. I am an adult so I think I can be trusted here. I just quickly recalled what color meat is supposed to be.   As for the shrimp, I'm still not sure. I'm not currently sitting on a toilet so I guess I did it right.  YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO A FINANCIAL AGREEMENT...  Ok, so you recall your food safety tips and you are managing to avoid food-borne illness. You better not make any mistakes with the foods you choose because.... get this... they charge you $5 for each plate of unfinished food. We didn't really get a definition of \"unfinished\" but it put this weird, extreme version of \"you better eat your vegetables\" vibe over the entire lunch. In this case, replace the word \"vegetables\" with \"new and foreign types of raw meat combinations.\"  I suddenly understood the strange sign in the lobby that declared everyone who sits at a table will be charged, even vegetarians. I thought it was odd but now I get it. If you are vegetarian... just don't. Don't.  This basically kills the idea of food exploration. If you aren't familiar with Korean BBQ, this place isn't going to let you explore it unless you have a wad of $5 bills. Break the rules, pay the penalty.  The warning on the menu about CCTV cameras in use really gave the big brother (errr... big mother) feeling an extra punch. I've seen CCTV camera notices on wall placards but the menu approach was new. There was one meat-cheese dish that wasn't very appealing and I contemplated wrapping it up in a napkin and hiding it on the seat next to me until we left but it was too dark to see the locations of the cameras. I ate it.  Before you assume I don't get it... Yes, I know why they do this. It's to avoid widespread waste but there has to be a better way.  I SHOULD HAVE READ UP ON BASIC KOREAN COOKING...  There are also six little bowls of stuff at the table which are obviously designed to be used in the cooking process but there is no information about them. Pickled cabbage, what I think was mashed potatoes, etc. We had to ask what they were. I think we just left it at that. It would have helped to know what to do with them or at least which raw meat they are best for. Again, if you know you're Korean BBQ, this is probably awesome. I am pretty sure the other three things on the side were table salt, some sort of other salt, and a vinegar.  SERVICE... IS LACKING? NO... FLEETING...  I'm not sure I can call the service lacking... it was just, in little bursts from at least half a dozen people. After the explanation and disclaimers at the beginning, we saw our waiter very briefly a few more times. He forgot most of the non-food items we requested and had to ask again (e.g. more napkins). Oh, he never brought rice that he promised and we asked a few times. He did keep our drinks filled (or someone did, they swooped in so fast and it's dark, it could have been anyone... and I was concentrating on making sure I cooked things enough and cleaned my plate).  BOTTOM LINE....  I left feeling I wasted a lot of money, didn't get to really explore much of the food, and couldn't really nail down anything that made it worthwhile. I'm glad we tried it and satisfied our curiosity but won't be going back.  Weekend lunch pricing is the same as dinner = $25 per person. It's a little cheaper for lunch during the week.",

Been to Korean bbq places in NY and each table had a vent, sucking smoke. We left the place smelling like bbq.   I don't like the fact that it's not a buffet style where you get your own food and start cooking, not sure if it's an AZ health code thing or what, as it is my first time in az at a Korean bbq. Servers will bring only 4 items at a time, you pay flat $25 for all you can eat, but service is slow and by our third round we were tired of waiting. I don't know if I'd try it again, it was an OK experience but will have to go to another Korean bbq when I go to NYC",

I thought they might stall a bit since there is a time limit on how long you can stay but they helped us get our moneys worth in the time we had!   Go early, or be prepared for a wait, but it's worth it! I would suggest going with a group of 4 or more so that you can split the meat and have a better experience trying more things.  The salad they bring with the meal was one of my favorite dishes, so delicious.  As for the meats, you order meat after meat after meat until you have the meat sweats. I would suggest clearing you calendar for the next 6 hours so you can have time to digest and enjoy the euphoria! :)",

As soon as we were done with our food the busser and servers all worked together to to help each other and kept our table so clean and uncluttered. We will request Sergi him every time! He's kind, easy to talk to, and very on top of taking care of his guests. Stephen, the bartender, makes THE BEST drinks and modified some drinks to our liking and made the drinks better. Hands down worth the price, the drive, and your time. If I could give this place 10 stars I would! Strongly recommend!",

I do wish they kept certain things on the menu though that California locations have.  The food comes out quick. But I think when they are busy and you have to order an item that you don't have to cook, sometimes it does take longer and we had to ask a few times when it would come such as the tofu stew and japchae.  We had to wait for a table but it was expected since we went on a Saturday for my birthday so to kill time we went to their bar. It took awhile for someone to approach us and even say hi. The floor around the bar was very sticky and our shoes kept getting stuck.   You are allowed to order 4 uncooked items at a time but the portions are small. I love their japchae because it's basically all noodles with some vegetables in their but mainly noodles. The only thing I do wish is that they gave you more of it. The salad is a must try! Really random but the dressing is AMAZING! I wish they would sell that dressing they make because I can probably eat that every day with a salad or as a dipping sauce!",

Except that the water tastes like tempe sewage, forcing you to buy a soda, and I still don't know what mashed potatoes have to do with Korean food bc no one bothered to explain anything with out flagging and asking.   Really did have high expectations. I have made my own marinades at home before and was looking forward to experiencing the authentic version of this but really can't see what the big deal was about the food, I found it bland for the most part, no choice in the salad dressing, no kitchen items, and they should say how many pieces come per order for things because for the two of us, we felt pressure to eat more than we wanted to and only found out after that we could have ordered half orders.  No desire to come back. Will try Koreatown next.",

There are several items on the menu, and you end up cooking most of them yourself at your table in a saucer-shaped grill. I wish I had known this going in because why the hell did I leave the office to take on all these additional responsibilities? No idea if that chicken I made was the reason my peer has been out of the office the past few days.  We did the all-you-can-eat lunch where you order, cook, eat, and repeat. It felt like a race, even though we had 2 hours. Before the food you ordered shows up, they bring you a plate of sauce/seasonings to dip your food in. Then they bring you around 8 little plates of randomness you didn't order...one of which was a tiny scoop of mashed potatoes. Very bizarre! Try eating those with chopsticks. Then you have the cooking utensils with tongs and giant scissors...just a lot going on in your space. I feel sorry for whoever has to clean all of those dishes. We had to have gone through at least 50 of them at our table alone.  I would recommend this place if you're looking for something different or on an awkward first date. Most of the food was good, but it's too involved if I had been drinking like I usually am.",

Side dishes weren't the best we've had. Salad was delicious and refreshing. We skipped the pork. Chicken, beef and octopus were delicious! The staff could have been more attentive when it comes to time for grill changes. Waiting for a grill change took time away from us cooking our food. Overall, a great experience and we will be returning. Will definitely save some room to buy their ice cream macaroons for dessert!",

Your clothes and purses will smell like bbq afterwards so don't wear your favorite fancy clothes if you plan to eat here :)  I came here the week after their opening with a Korean friend who's visiting town. She moved to MN for school and was dying for some KBBQ. We're both USC alumni so we've had our fair share of bomb kbbq in LA's KTown.   Pros: -Lots of parking (mall parking) -clean and new facility - very attentive staff - fair prices (same prices as the other Gen locations in CA) - meat quality is quite good (LOVE the tongue, hawaiian steak, brisket, pork belly, and baby octopus)  Cons: (Why I only gave this location 3 star) - a little hard to find since it's in the middle of the mall - we had several dirty plates and bowls with crusty dried food on them :( - The soups (bean paste and soon du boo were luke warm when served) - the wait is pretty long since they're new, yet they won't allow reservation. - they don't have any hot sauce, this is like a crime against asian food lol  Overall, decent spot because the KBBQ is new to Arizona and there's not much competition (Took this trend long enough to catch on =.=) For the same price, I've had much better kbbq in CA, BUT this will definitely help me satisfy cravings if I can't go back from for my meat fix :)",

The food was good and everything but our experience was kind of ruined by our server Shirley. She asked us if we had been there before and we told her no and then she pretty much vanished for the rest of the night. She didn't explain the condiments at the table. She didn't explain anything about the meats. She didn't give us anything to eat our food with or napkins. We kept having to ask other servers walking by for things or the busser. At one point we sat at the table with our food burning because we had no plates to put it on. We pretty much just wanted to get out of there at that point because we were so frustrated. I'm not sure if we will be back although the Hawaiian steak was delicious. Maybe next time when you have people that have never been to a restaurant like that you spend at least 60 seconds explaining things really quick. We never got an apology for her extended absence and we left still not knowing what all those condiments were and what they were best used with. Pretty bummed we wasted our second date night without our baby since she's been born feeling clueless, embarrassed, and awkward at a restaurant we were so excited to try.",

Our server was Ly, he was very helpful and prompt with our orders. Even though he had other tables he didn't loose his cool when we couldn't decide what to order next. Never felt rushed or overwhelmed. Ly always had a smile on his face. I also have to give a SHOUT out to Anthony the busser. At GEN when customers get seated every employee who hears it shouts \"Welcome to GEN\". Anthony was awesome! He showed excitement and enthusiasm at the little task of welcoming the customers which made my dining experience very eventful! Anthony also was very prompt at clearing tables, sweeping, and even talking to customers with a smile. I hope he'll get promoted soon to server because he was hustling! This establishment has the operations down. Even the manager changed and became a part of the help and assisted the staff.   What about the food??? Well it was good! I would say it's one of the best kbbq places in town. The meats came out fresh and in good portion. There are 32 items to choose from for lunch. For the price and choices, it's the best in town. I felt like they take into consideration of how many people are in your party so you don't get a huge portion of one type of meat and get full fast. I looked around and noticed that bigger parties received bigger portions to accommodate. Very smart!! There are other establishments that aren't quite as nice in decor, service, and food. Or you receive one and not the other. Not at GEN though, you'll receive it all. I hope that they can keep this high level of service and quality of food going.   The only complaint that I have is I wished that they would really amp up the Korean flavors in their marinades (ex: bulgogi) and in their banchans (side dishes). But it was excellent enough for me and my friend to make another lunch meeting this Friday!!",

    "text": "This place is pretty good. So many people come to eat at here. Food is good, servers look really awesome in shirts and pants, everything is quick and good except that they never answer your phone. I have a couple of friends working here as a servers and they told me that sometimes they have to answer the phone call because they don't know what the hell the hostess are doing. I have experiences working at restaurants as a host, and main couple jobs for them are answering the phone call and greet people and guide them to their seats. Yesterday was going to be my second time visiting here, but I decided to go to other place, not because of 45mins wait time, but because of the hostesses' attitude. I asked them if they have a phone and why they didn't get a phone call when I call them like freaking 3 times, and they just said that they were so busy and that was why they didn't want to answer the phone call. Okay, I was going to ask them what the wait time is, and if there is a wait time, if I can make a reservation. I live in Phoenix, so it takes about 30minutes to get to Gen. I called them as I left my house, no answer, 5 minutes later, no answer, and 10 minutes later, no answer. If they answered my phone and answered me some questions, I didn't have to waste my gas to go here and get out without having a meal from there. I honestly liked here for my first time, but sorry man, those two hostesses in the front yesterday made me give you guys only 1 star.",

    "text": "Oh man what an experience.  I've always wanted to try Korean BBQ and I'm so glad this place was my first experience.   I was visiting the city so can't really say much about the area. The restaurant and surrounding plaza area is very nice. The atmosphere felt good and I felt very comfortable walking around with my wife. Inside this restaurant however, was yet another amazing experience. I was blown away by the interior design with all the bbqing at each table going on.   After we were seated (no wait, in prime time too), they asked if we ever tried this before which I mentioned we have not. They were very well detailed in explaining how the process works and were very patient and nice when I needed them to repeat a couple things. You pay one price (I believe it was $35~) and you can order as much as you want, 4 at a time per table.  If I remember right we ordered: Steak Calimari Bulgogi Brisket Chicken Two types of fried chicken  The table already comes prepared with veggie side dishes, they also provide rice and salad.  As far as actually grilling the items, I was a bit nervous as I wasn't sure if I would grill everything properly, but it was actually quite easy. They also came and gave advice whenever you asked of how long to grill and prepare each item if you need the advice.   I didn't think it was possible to eat as much as I did, it was so worth it. The only regret I have was getting the fried chicken, it's basically already prepared which should have been obvious, I wanted to experience everything I eat from the grilling I did so that got more attention to what I would eat. You can't take any food home with you for obvious reasons.  They also came and changed out the metal griller whenever it got too dirty. They did this twice, which was awesome. They really pay attention to you.  I'm now a huge fan of Korean BBQ thanks to this place, highly recommended. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'm hitting this place again.",

(Your money will be totally worth it)  The variety of dishes and options are HUGE!.  Spicy, sweet, sour, blah blah, delicious!  The whole idea here is to seat on a booth or stool, have literally a small grill next to you with multiple seasoning to add flavor and cook until you get food coma (or gout), whatever comes first.  Highly advised to call before or arrive early during weekends, it gets packed.  Price is definitely worth it. Great location!  Enjoy!!",

    "text": "Took the family to Gen this afternoon for lunch.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasant modern and the sound level was acceptable. The problem was the service.  This is a 'concept' restaurant in which you basically cook your own food table side on a grill.  The idea is similar to the Melting Pot where you cook your own food in a variety of fondue sauces.    I won't even talk about the first waiter who was a complete mess.  He was so bad, I called the manager over and she reassigned the \"lead\" waitress to our table.  From there on, the service was quick but it entirely missed the point of the restaurant.  By way of example, they place a three chambered sauce/spice tray in front of each diner. That said, nobody bothered to explain what the spices were or how they should be used on the proteins and veggies.    We ordered several proteins and a few veggies and they all came promptly. But here again, nobody gave us a clue about how they should be cooked.  As another example, we ordered the strip steak (number 1 on the lunch menu).  It appeared to be a nice cut of marbled steak.  So, as one would expect, I put in on the grill not realizing that (since no knives were provided) that I should have cut it into bite sized pieces with the provided cooking shears (not a great way to cut a steak, btw).  Similarly, while I know how long to cook squid, I don't know anything about octopus.  We ended up with several pieces of tire rubber.  Ultimately, this restaurant relies entirely on the waiters to make the experience.  If they aren't engaging and helpful, it doesn't matter how fresh the ingredients are (and, to be honest, all of the ingredients did indeed appear quite fresh).  The fast service is appreciated and if I told the waiter I knew what I was doing, then that might have been enough.    Bottom line, I wouldn't return.",

We were told the wait would be 30 min, we got our text after only 10 so that was a plus. They have tons of tables, pretty big restaurant. I liked the high boy type tables that's different.   We were seated right away and the hostess said she has to measure the kids. Not sure if that's how all Gens charge (according to height) but just an FYI. So if you got a tall kid who doesn't really eat a lot, might not be worth it to go since anyone over 50 inches (4 ft 2) is charged as an adult. We went on a Saturday where its all dinner prices and had a 7 year old who's tall (4ft 4) and charged full price, he barely ate..so just keep that in mind.  Service was good..our server was nice and attentive. She was quick with our orders so we were never waiting for more food. As for the portions. Small! So make sure to order multiple of the same dish. You can only order 4 dishes at a time, but our server took our next order before our first order came out and so forth, so it worked out.  They are in a good location so even if there is a wait you can find something to do while at the marketplace   Since there arent that many AYCE Korean BBQ places on the east side or Tempe...I'm sure I'll go back.",

You pay $24.95 and can eat for up to two hours (last call for food selection is at 10:30, though; so if you want the full two hours, arrive before 8:30). There's 37 different items to choose from, and you can pick up to 4 at a time. There is a grill in the middle of the table surrounded by sides. You can also ask for salad and white rice. The sides are refillable upon request. The Hawaiian chicken and garlic chicken were definitely our favorites. My husband said the steak was great as well.   We also got a surprise when we realized Alex Len from the NBA Phoenix Suns was sitting behind us. After dinner, he got a picture with us!!    If you've never been to a Korean BBQ, make sure you let your server know, and you'll be guided through the process. So to sum it up, if you're in the mood for a fun and delicious dining experience, definitely check this place out!!!",

The marinated octopus was better than I anticipated as well. Faris was a fantastic server! With being hospitable, efficient and genuinely friendly!

When I first got there we walked up to the front and put ourselves on the waiting list, 1 hour and 45 minutes! Granted it was a Friday around Christmas so we waited!!   Pros:  Had a huge list of different meats and seafood!!! starving, we were super excited to try everything! The KFC chicken was phenomenal!! We got multiple servings. The boogie was so yummy And so were the potstickers! The service was great and They were very prompt on delivering the food. Even though they were so busy   Cons: the seafood was AWFUL. Like actually the WORST. The shrimp was so mushy it was half liquid. We also tried the calamari. And it was the saltiest fishiest flavor I've ever had. And was actually rubber. I feel sick even talking about it!!  It's super unfortunate I had really high hopes!! But after I ate here I was super sick my stomach hurts so bad. So I guess I won't be a Korean BBQ fan",

The food was good because I seasoned it and cooked it and it didn't sit well with me that I had no gloves and I touched raw food with my bare hands. If you don't mind the things I mentioned above then by all means try the place out it was 16.99 all you can eat for two hours!",

Minimal options for vegetarians/ vegans. I prefer the #10: kalbi ribs. I don't come often because I can't eat very much but you have two hours to eat as much as your body can handle haha.

The red wine pork was gross (should have picked a safer marinade) and it killed my appetite for the rest of the night. There was a weird cleaning fluid after taste with the salad and meat. The korean side dishes were strangely already at our table as if they've been sitting there all night and they gave us very little rice. Not worth the money. Overall, just not into \"cook it yourself\" restaurants and all the raw meat. Just makes me paranoid I cross contaminated something else on the table.  Also smoke kept getting in my face.",

Thankfully its located in a \"mall\" so you can leave your name and number (they text once your table is available) and you can walk around and hang out nearby or at the Barnes and Noble. The place itself is pretty big. You can order 3-4 items a the time. I like their brisket and their steak. The shrimp is good but on the smaller side so more work for less gain. I haven't really had an item that I absolutely disliked. The banchan is good. Ask for the salad! Now, it's nothing like California korean bbq however its pretty good and the price is reasonable.",

Starting off the servers and the customer service that they bring really help with dining here a lot more enjoyable! In particular I have had Denny, serve me on many occasion and that dude is amazing. Always quick with the orders and other request. Phillip is also a server that I praise because like Denny, always quick with getting orders in and any other thing that we need, he's there! Leyna is also a great service with great recommendations, I've never had beef tongue before till she brought it out and I'll have to say, it's actually pretty good. Aside from the great servers, Travis is also very helpful and provides exceptional service. I understand the meat quality is hit or miss on certain days, but it's not a deal breaker. Also shoutout to Chris/Kris(?) for always being an awesome host. I've dined here an embarrassing amount of times and have no problem waiting. I've waited  3 hours one time. And it's worth it. If you guys ever go and get the severs I mentioned, it's going to be a good visit.",

    "text": "Visiting from San Diego, had to AYCE once.  Our hosts brought us to this spot in the Tempe Marketplace.  We arrived about 12:30 on a Saturday and we had a party of 9 (with 2 kids), so we opted out of the High Table in fear of the kids playing and falling off.  The high table looked like the only thing that could accommodate (comfortably) more than 6?  That said we ended up getting split up into 2 booths, at least back to back.  FYI - they don't have steamed egg here!  If that's a deal breaker, beware.  What they do have:  A very extensive menu, of raw meats, seafood - as well as some cooked appetizers!  The first round of meats we ordered were served on these huge plates, with what looked like single servings.  At first we were a little sad, but as we got settled in - we actually really like it. - Why?  The service was SWIFT, and we were able to try, and eat a  lot of variety, because that's how every meal should be.  All of the food tasted very high quality.  All of our servers were always available when we needed them, grill change was quick when requested.   It really improved the experience (And made up for not having steamed egg).  The location is great, good spacing between tables, high ceiling, good ventilation (a requirement for this type of meal), and overall good experience.  Looking forward to our San Diego/Mira Mesa location to open and hope they can replicate it - and have steamed egg.",

The AC was broken and we were seated by the doors (this was in summer) the broken AC isn't why I gave ZERO stars.  I gave zero stars because the menu reads as this marinated wondrous meat and you get plain beef. Apparently, you season yourself which is fine but they only provided you with 1/2 tsp of salt. Lol anyone who seasons their meat knows this amount of salt for all the proteins we ordered is useless. We also ordered the pork belly... joke was on us. We got bacon (I know punny since bacon is tech pork belly). And this \"pork belly\" was awful it tasted old and just plain BLAH! Costco thick cut bacon has everything on that trash. We asked our server to stop our time (20 mins maybe) and that we weren't enjoying ANY of what we ordered. He didn't say much just got the manager.. the manager was THEE absolute most unprofessional manager I've ever been in contact with. We asked if we could just pay for what we ordered. He stated it didn't work that way. I said we wouldn't be paying full price because we took one bite of our 3 proteins and HATED them all. He screamed \"get up get up!!! Get the fuck out\" so we did. My husband and I stood outside the front doors just looking at each other shocked. Lol what a joke.",

Not to mention online the dinner price was $21, and in the restaurant the price is $25 dollars, compared to the $16 dollar lunch price. For the price to increase by ten dollars is ridiculous and second for them to charge us ten dollars more because of their wait is even more absurd.

    "text": "I would leave zero stars if I could. Literally went to this restaurant on Tuesday of this week, yes, as in four days ago. On Tuesday we were prepared to pay $10.00 for our 4 year olds dinner, after she lined up on the wall to check for height we were advised she would be free. Great! We had a decent meal and good service that night.   My pregnant cravings got the best of me and I wanted a repeat of Tuesday's dinner. So as of 15 minutes ago we were very pleased to walk into the restaurant and offered seating right away. Not much of a surprise when my daughter was asked to stand on the wall again, except this time her charge was $10. Come again??? What changed between Tuesday and Friday? Certainly not her height.   After having the hostess squawk at me about her being over 40 inches Gil Prado, the worlds most useless, condescending, arrogant, piece of crap general manager proceeded to explain how he had 7 kids and how they grow very quickly. He remained a stick in the mud about how they were being courteous to me about her being free on Tuesday, and that he had no idea who worked on Tuesday. I explained to him that I had no problem paying the $10 tonight or on Tuesday and I'm sure they had a schedule that would point them in the direction of whom they should be relating their coaching to. All I wanted was for him to acknowledge that it should and he would advise staff that if they give out such courtesy that they advise consumers that is one, and not to expect it in the future... especially when they visit the establishment more than once per week. He literally laughed in my face. What a piece that guy is.   In reality the restaurant just opened not too long ago he can be smug about the fact I did not eat there tonight nor will EVER spend one red penny there in the future. But, it's customers like me who not only expect good food, but stellar service as well. I don't give two craps how much I enjoy the food at a restaurant, if I receive bad service, especially from some greaseball (Gil Prado) whom had 20 other ways of handling a a simple customer issue, but chose to remain a prick instead then I'm out.   Sadly, Gil Prado watched my family walk of this restaurant and as my husband stated that he would be giving a bad review vehemently confirmed he did not care. Classy.  For the record my 4 year old is in the 90th percentile for height and stood above the line by less than a half inch. Eventually Gens service will lose them business, if jerks like Gil Prado still have any authority.   Our complaint will not end with this review.",

Got a bit worse as the restaurant got packed.  Still working out the kinks.  Extremely busy restaurant.  Walked in at 6 and sat down right away.  At 7pm, wait becomes ~1hr.

That said, Gen Korean BBQ House was lacking the array of traditional Korean side dishes (fish cakes, steamed egg, etc) that really compliment the meal. The selection of meats is vast (36 in all) but the non-marinated meat selections are very forgettable.  The worst part of the meal was the service... I am forgiving of inattentive service on a busy evening, but we were utterly ignored at 8 pm on a Tuesday night. We resorted to asking any employee walking by our table for more food, napkins, silverware, etc as our waiter disappeared after taking our initial order. There has to be better KBBQ options available in the Valley. You can skip Gen Korean BBQ.",

We went once on a holiday on Monday not knowing that the lunch time hours is now full price. The waitress and hostess did not tell us as a courtesy about the holiday price. I would think you would just in case when entering or just sat down. No signs posted on door either. Manager was not apologetic. 2) Try not to sit next to the table that holds 8 or more people. Last few times it was hard to get our waiter to get us more food. You want to be cooking while eating! 3) Make sure kids are hungry! They charge by height. My 8 yr old is full price. That's all I got. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Finally I have been waiting for Korean bbq is arizona for quite awhile! This place is legit and definitely brings the \"Cali\" vibe to Tempe! The environment is nice, waiters are pretty attentive at getting you your food on a timely manner! It's kinda weird that you can only order 4 things at a time, but I get it. It's to make sure they have control of their kitchen, and so that not too many plates stack up on your table!  The side dishes (ban chan) are pretty good! Nothing extravagant and they don't have fish cakes, BUT you don't really go there for the ban chan, you go there for the meat! It is excellent! Always start with the brisket! That gets your palette going, then go for then for the more sweet choices. I highly the Hawaiian steak, the rib meat, the Galbi, and the premium steak. I like more chewy stuff, so this may not be for you! The garlic pork belly is soooo good too! Just like tasty bacon!   The Seafood is alright but it's worth a try if you're still hungry! I'm gonna stick to the beef and pork options! The KFC (Korean fried chicken) is exactly like crispy popcorn chicken with orange chicken sauce! Pretty darn good! The cheese pork cutlet is pretty bomb, however my wife didn't like it! Kinda reminds me of a good street food option!   So overall, Gen BBQ, doesn't disappoint! I rate it 5 stars based off of the location we are in! It's definitely the best in Arizona! Some tips I would recommend for people is to ask for garlic and jalapenos! Just place it on the grill and let them char! It flavors the meat, and it's good to munch on! Also ask for rice paper! It's a Cali trend, but it's pretty fun to wrap your meat, some garlic, maybe some lettuce into a nice wrap!",

We ordered two meats to start off but then I realized our waiter didn't turn on the grill. We had to wait a bit until the second server came out with our meat and turned on the burner for us (it wasn't a big deal since the grill heated up so quickly). I ordered a Cajun chicken but I feel like I ordered wrong as it didn't taste great and I love Cajun.   Loved the atmosphere but it didn't feel like regular KBBQ place,? I was put off at how little there was (even the menu seemed scarce?). I plan on giving it another try during dinner time but for now, it's just okay. It isn't the best.",

They marinate the meat but it's less than par quality in taste and meat quality is questionable. Part of why Korean bbq is so good is because of the sauces and marinades they use. I will go back and try a few other things. This run was good, far from excellent and miles from great.",

    "text": "I have been to Gen in different CA locations, so this one I had high expectations.   I came last Friday with three of my friends. The wait was 15-20 mins when we arrived at 6pm because there weren't a lot of people that time.   The hostesses had a hard time organizing themselves that the managers have to be there. I feel there should be more servers than hostess (some look like it's their first time working in general). We were able to get out tables and our server was very persistent with her service, in a good way! Yeah she always kept checking every time, but heck, it's a busy night and the servers showed so much effort of their service. The bus boys were great as well. They always change our grills when there is burnt residue from grilling meat and clean so well.   Food is standard Korean BBQ but what was different is their Pork Belly marinades. The red wine and smoked garlic ones are my favorites and so were the Hawaiian Pork and Gen Bulgogi. Some meats are pretty thick, so you need to have some patience to cook it well. Their fried chicken is a good starter with the meal.   Overall review: Great to Start. Food was bomb, servers and bus boys did the best service ever, but hostess need better organization with themselves when tables are ready. The building need a bit better on their ventilation system to have the AC not blow in guest with the grill smoke and mess with the heating temperature of the grill.   I don't mind coming back with friends and hopefully they have reservations soon. Compared to other Gen's, this one has the best dining service with servers and bus boys. But the interior looks a bit undeveloped.",

    "text": "Gen is a hidden Gem in Tempe Market Place!!!  Its a classy all you can eat Korean BBQ at an affordable price about $16/Person for Lunch $25/Person for Dinner.  If you go during lunch, you won't have to wait as long maybe 15-30min. If you go for dinner, be prepared to wait 1-3hrs to be seated.  The host will take your number and will text you when your table is ready. There is a Barnes and Noble right across. To kill time, I usually grab a book and sit in their coffee shop while we wait for our table.    Once you receive the text, you have 10min to make it to the host. Gen is Always really crowded in the evening. Literally a rotating door of people.  You feel welcomed as you are walking to your table one of the servers will scream Welcome to Gen! The vibe is right, the decor is modern chic and the music is good. They play the latest hip hop and R&B. They have plenty of ventilation so the room isn't Smokey.   Each table has their own private grill. Every diner gets his or her own tray with compartments for green tea -salt, sesame oil with brown sugar, the spicy bean paste samjang and a side salad. (I'm usually very picky with salad dressings but this one, is so good!!)    The menu selection is fairly extensive, featuring more than three dozen items to choose from. The usual offerings of marinated short rib, brisket, shrimp, chicken, calamari among the options. Most of them are items to cook on the grill but several are already cooked dishes to round out your meal. You're allowed to order 4 dishes at a time and you have a two hour time limit to eat.  Never had to wait long for the food and our server was always happy to place more rounds for us. the manager walked around constantly making sure everything was running smoothly and thanking customers for coming.   The staff would rotate out our grill nearly every twenty-thirty minutes. Drinks are fairly priced. You will leave full and satisfied without feeling rushed. Gen continues to be my favorite Korean food spot!",

Most of the chicken dishes were well marinated and very flavorful. However, the \"volcano\" chicken which was supposed to be really spicy was borderline sweet! In fact, it tasted suspiciously similar to the Korean Fried chicken, with minimal chili flakes sprinkled on.  My other complaint was that the waiters didn't really help us out with the food - even though we made it clear that this was our first time having Korean BBQ. We later figured out that we're supposed to use the scissors to cut the bigger portions of meat - would have been so much easier if someone told us that!",

I figured this place has to be super yummy to be packed like that and they're new. There aren't a lot of AYCE KBBQ here in AZ. They are mostly in California. They opened the right spot which was Tempe Marketplace. That's where there's a lot of people.  Anyways, we ended up waiting an hour and twenty minutes. We ordered steak, thin sliced beef, shrimp, etc. Man oh man it was so good! We all ate so much that by the end of the night we all had to unbutton are zipper pants because that's how full we were.  Only bad thing about this place is, that the servers kept getting our orders confused with the other table.. Hey, I get it you guys are still new and you just opened so I'll give it a free pass this time. Also the service was a little slow. Oh and please have better filtration for the water you guys served. It taste so nasty like I felt like I was drinking toilet water. Not that I ever tasted that but yeah it was just really gross. Other than that, food was awesome! Will be back hope it's better with the service and water next time I visit!",

The table has a little set up that was neat with dipping salts and then when your server comes they pour in a liquid sauce to dip. I noticed right away that my dish was broken in 2 corners, which I just thought that kinda sucks cause I'm paying $25 just for myself to eat there. Shortly after we started to eat I noticed the liquid was draining from the bottom of the dish, but they replaced it. We ordered a few meats and started grilling, which is fun to do at the table. The flavors were good but some of the meat was pretty fatty (chicken and steak). Service was over all good.",

I exaggerate but I can guarantee that I was terribly excited.   Pricing is $24.99, $15.99 for weekday lunches. I really wish they were here when I was in college so I could take advantage of the lunch pricing but unfortunately, full priced it is. Their service is awesome. They are on the ball with your orders, which is crucial with your two hour time limit. They switch out your grill the moment it gets dirty, and on top of all that, they were efficient in getting us our free flowing drinks - my experience was all I could ask for from Gen's.  I should probably back up and explain all you can eat Korean BBQ: check in with the hostess, wait for a text to say your table's ready, sit, decide on a drink, order dishes of raw meat, wait twenty seconds for said raw meat, and throw it on the grill, and grill away! I believe there's a two plate limit per person per round of orders but the grill isnt quite big enough for more anyway. There's also a two hour time limit so keep those orders going and keep on grilling.  I'm so full.",

They took my phone number and when I got the alert that our table was ready, it was another 10 minutes before they actually sat us. I was a little annoyed about it because I can understand a few minutes but why alert me when my table won't be ready for 10 minutes?  Anyway, we sat and the table was prepared with the Korean side dishes. The hostess asked us if it was our first time there and we said yes. She told us we had a 2-hour limit and the 2 of us could have 4 plates at all times and that any uneaten raw food would include a $5 fee. When our server showed up, he just assumed we knew what we were doing - we didn't. I was hoping for some guidance.  So when our meats arrived, we just threw it on the grill. We kinda wish we knew the grill was not non-stick because everything stuck. We eventually had to get a new grill because our first one was burnt. Like I said, we didn't know what we were doing.   We liked the variety of meats and dishes you could choose from. I think the only dish we had that I would not get again would be the short ribs - way to chewy (and I tried to not overcook it because I knew it could cause chewyness).   $24.95 per person for 2 hours. While it was a nice meal, I felt like I was so worried about my food cooking that I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. Then we decided to turn the temperature of our grill down so that the thin slices of meat wouldn't stick to the grill and then tear apart as we try to peel it off the metal.   Will we be back? Probably. My sweet tooth was sad they didn't have more of a dessert selection. You can purchase macaron ice cream sandwiches at the front desk but it's not on the menu.",

Varied menu that allowed me to try a number of new things--especially after just recently starting to eat meat again. My 2nd visit was just a little frustrating due to circumstances. I had a large party from work showing up. We had people go in advance to ask for a table, even though we had called days in advance as well. Our group waited almost 3 hours for a table and a few of our people had to end up leaving without eating dinner because of it.",

Service was OK, but you really have to catch the attention of the servers in order to get more food... I like when people are more on the job about asking if you need anything else...   The Food was good and we will definitely go back here again. It's a Korean Style BBQ House as the name implies so you pick your meats and cook them yourself on the grill at your table.   The new location in Tempe Town is a nice location.   All in all I like this place and you will too....  GO FEED YOUR INNER ANIMAL!",

We asked for Ssam Jang (Bean sauce) and garlic for roasting. The quality to the meats were good, but not great. The premium steak was my favorite. I also liked the short ribs and spicy and regular bulgogi beef. The crunchy fried chicken was a bit over sauced but good also (served ready to eat). We also tried the baby octopus and squid and I was less enthused.   The wait time on Friday around 6:30 was an hour; however, once we were seated, service was prompt and friendly.  My biggest complaint was the loud dance music. I couldn't even hear myself talk.   Overall a good value for the food and service.",

If you don't finish, say, cuts of extraneous fats or the occasional anomaly of unbreakable bulgogi that somehow mutated into a glob of gelatinous protein, they won't peg a fine on you.   In my experience, Gen is most enjoyable with a small party. I always go with one other person, one who is capable of consuming as many dishes as I. Historically I have been proud to consume twice my body weight in Korean BBQ at the Gen in Tustin, CA. The Tempe, AZ venue, I am sad to say, does not compare.  While I appreciate the enthusiasm when I enter the building (e.g. \"So-and-so, party of two!\" \"WELCOME TO GEN!!!!\"), anyone who's visited the California locations will notice an absence of rice paper and acceptably sized portions. For your bewilderment, please order the jap chae and bring a magnifying glass to observe it.   It's an otherwise good restaurant, and probably the best we can get in Arizona, so enjoy it if you're in the area. However, the second you enter California, be joyful, for you shall be thus welcomed with far superior Gens and other Korean BBQ restaurants.",

Once I heard it had opened, we immediately made plans to go on a Sunday afternoon. Be aware that they don't take reservations, and we ended up waiting hangry for two hours. By the time we were finally seated, we were solely dedicated to maximizing the two-hour all-you-can-eat grazing period. You can only order four dishes at a time, and in the most efficient way possible we were planning out our next four before they even brought out the last four. Our most popular were beef tongue, bulgogi, galbi, and garlic pork, but definitely branch out and try the other stuff.   Inside is somewhat of an usual ambience -- it's almost like a nightclub with the dark tables and neon lighting. They were also spinning up some old school rap (Tupac, Biggie, etc.), and there was a huge multi-TV screen in the back that was being totally wasted on some network TV movie.   When I went, they were definitely still figuring stuff out, and we had to ask for rice (their cooker broke) and some of our missing dishes a few times, but they may have it under control now.   It's a little pricy, and they only do dinner prices on the weekend, but for the sheer amount of pretty decent quality kbbq you can stuff down your gullet, it's a pretty good deal.   I had planned to do other stuff after eating... lol. If you do it right, this should be an entire day where you consume all your nutrients in one sitting and then go home and veg out on the couch.   Also, the hostesses are really cute!",

It's a silly concept to come to a restaurant just to pay a pretty penny to cook your own food. Then a whole different feeling of \"one night stand regret\" to realize that the fire is so hot to char the outside of your food and not cook the inside thoroughly that you worry about food poisoning. Granted, it is all you can eat and the meat selection is plentiful, but after all is said and done, it was worth the one time experience but it's completely fine to never want to come back.

Once you sit down your greeted by your server who will give you the run down of what everything is on the table and how things works. You have 2 hours for $24 per person all you can eat dinner and you can order up to 4 items at a time. NOTE: you do have to pay for any unused/uncooked/uneaten raw meat. So once you start getting to the end and full, slow down so you don't over order or you will pay... literally. Ha   Our servers name was Shannon and she was AMAZING! Always at our table changing the grill, making sure our drinks were full, putting in our next order, and helped us at first move the meat around since clearly it took us awhile to figure it out. All the staff was INCREDIBLE though. There was multiple people that checked in on us and placed our next order to insure the protein was constantly flowing.   Now on to the food!!! They start you out with a ginger/Asian salad and each person gets a bowl of rice. Salad is good and refreshing. Then you start to order the protein 4 at time and it's raw So it comes out quick. Half the time I forgot what I was eating but it was all super good and pre marinated. The chicken is hard to cook because it takes longer and comes in big chunks. Some of the thin sliced meats were hard to cook because they stuck to the grill or cooked way too fast. Your first two orders you will mess up the cooking but then you kind of learn how to do it and what you like.  My best advice is to just take your time. Order your 4 proteins at first and figure out how to get the cook perfect before ordering another round. It can get Over whelming trying to figure it out while they bring you more food and your table is already full! We learned the hard way.... haha  Some of my favorites were the KFC(Korean fried chicken that comes out pre-cooked and taste like orange chicken), Hawaiian steak, and pork belly.   And in case you haven't ate enough yet... save room for dessert! They have $3.50 macaroon ice cream sandwiches in about 4-5 flavors. The mango and green tea were the best! It was a nice refreshing dessert after pigging out on all that food.   Overall it was a great and fun experience with our friends. Great place for people who love meat!! Lots and lots of meat! You will leave so full you hate yourself! I'm excited to come back and now that we know how it works, we will be pros! Haha thank you (:",

The overall team here work very smoothly and efficiently together. Food runners, servers, all made sure service was prompt. Food was spectacular. The meats were high quality, their description of \"premium\" is not an exaggeration. Everything was flavorful, well marinated, and decently proportioned. Small enough so that you do not become too full from just 2-3 dishes and dishes and can try a wider number of options of the available menu. Rice and about 7-8 banchan are offered in addition to the main menu for the price. They will also offer fresh jalepeno slices, sliced garlic, and radish wraps. I love the interior layout, decor, and vibe. Very trendy, yet the blue overtone is very relaxing. And the music isn't obnoxiously loud. Before our meal was over, we were already planning our next visit. I highly recommend the general meat dishes, ie premium pork belly, general bulgogi, premium steak, etc. It doesnt say it, but there are all already flavored in each of their respective traditional marinades. The other dishes with extra flavoring (garlic, spicy, etc) will be very overpowering. IMO, it takes away from the natural taste of the meats. Banchan selection and quality isn't going to be comparable to a sit down traditional Korean restaurant found in Chandler/Mesa/Glendale, I think it's to be expected, especially because you want to indulge in the main menu anywho with it being AYCE. Overall, we had an awesome dining experience.",

    "text": "My experience at this restaurant is a great example of how much of an effect customer service can have on a dinning experience. My group and I went to dinner on a Saturday night knowing we would have to wait- we waited about 1 hour and 30 minutes. We had Daniel as our waiter. Luckily, we had a few Korean BBQ veterans to guide us through the menu and ordering, because our waiter was no help. We ordered 4 items (the max that you can do at a time). One of those items being brisket. We went through about 3 different rounds of ordering, each time asking and reminding Daniel about our brisket, never receiving it. Finally, a bus boy/food runner who had dropped off some items for us asked how we were doing, and we asked him about the brisket- and he managed to track it down for us (he was also confused when we said we had already been waiting 30 plus minutes for it- its raw meat!!). This establishment is a \"grill your own food\" place. So all waiters are required to do is take food orders and run food, and occasionally change the grill. Somehow, our waited acted like this was a huge chore for him. Luckily, the food was good. That is whats keeping this rating from only one star. The beef bulgogi is EXCELLENT. The sides and salad are delicious and endless. Someone in my group dropped her chopsticks, and we asked the first person we saw walk by for more- this turned into 4 separate people trying to track down someone who could get us CHOPSTICKS. The icing on our not so great experience was that our waiter \"couldn't take more than 3 cards\" for the check when we tried to give him 4. We did however see plenty of tables with giving more than 3 cards, so not sure if this is a restaurant policy or just our particular waiter. I read the reviews after I went to the restaurant (rookie move, I know) and saw all everyone raving about the macrons. I would've love to try one. Daniel never mentioned them to us. Perhaps he was having an off night but he really put a damper on my desire to go back and visit again.",

It was to celebrate my sons 22nd bday (which I told the host twice about it) and he said \"oh don't worry we will take care of him we do birthdays big around here!  So I read the reviews first and knew we would have a long wait but I thought 2 hours at 8:30 at night would reduce the time but it didn't.  Then we waited about 15-20 minutes after we were seated for a waiter to come take out order and the explanation was far from anything understandable and because the music is blaring in there you just kind of give up and nod your head as if you understand!  So the service, the quality of the food, the waiter continuing to forget what we ordered each time he would come back to the table was a joke!  One time he came back and said everything ok here do you need anything else and we had been sitting there with no meat and hungry and we said ummmm we ordered more meat like 30 minutes ago and are waiting for it did you forget!  He looks at his tablet and goes let me check on that!  After a very disappointing experience throughout the entire time the Cous de gras was NO ONE SANG HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY KID OR BROUGHT HIM A DESERT!  For the price of 25.00 per person it was a total and complete disappointment!  Never returning there!",

All his recommendations were fabulous. We had the Hawaiian steak, thin sliced brisket, Hawaiian chicken, Garlic shrimp, beef bulgogi, and so much more! It was a great experience. We would have not tried the ice cream macaroons were it not for Michael. He recommended them as well. We had the cappuccino and strawberry and they both were to die for. Thank you Michael!",

The quality of the meat was good. However, there were a number of \"missed opportunities\" in my opinion, the most significant of which was the lack of lettuce/sesame leaves to wrap the meat in, no red pepper past, garlic or jalapenos to include in the lettuce wrap. Gen appears to be catering to customers who are not familiar with traditional Korean BBQ, which is unfortunate. Korean BBQ is nothing to be ashamed of...it is why my family and I seek out Korean restaurants whenever we are visiting a new city for the first time. All in all, a good value, but it could be better.",

We walked around for a bit and not even an hour later I got a text that the table was ready and even a phone call. That helps start an amazing night knowing it didn't take forever to sit down.  The food was amazing as well. You can have 4 meats at a time and can order more if everything is on the grill. No complaints and we were taken care of very well. Our waiter was James and he was amazing. Always checking on us to see if we wanted to order more, got my friends large bowls of mash potatoes and kim chi, always changing our grill for us, and even help celebrate my birthday by singing with other employees and was amazing at taking a pic for my party.  Above all I approve because they were playing kpop. 5 stars and can't wait to go back.",

I waited for about 2 hours and when seated the hostess was extremely friendly and went over the menu with us. Our waiter Kevin was very friendly and efficient. We were helped by a few employees when it came to refills and changing our grills and they were all great!

It was so clean and modern compared to the usual greasy and messy kbbq places in LA. Not only is the service really good, but also the meat is really something special. The marinades are so sweet and complement the meat pretty well. For all you can eat, the quality is actually really good. I recommend the chadol (/Brisket), Korean Fried Chicken, and all the marinated pork belly. Only $16 for lunch menu but you still get way more that you won't even be able to try everything.  Another unique aspect about Gen is that the smoke from the grills is vacuumed underneath the table, so none of that greasy meat smell on your clothes. They change your grills really often and check up on you to refill your meats pretty fast. I'm so glad we finally have all you can eat kbbq in AZ. As a college student, this place is godsend.",

It was marked as really spicy and she recommended getting it half portion. And it turned out  the volcano chicken was my FAVORITE from the entire menu. I do recommend it myself if you love spicy!

Update: You now need to have your whole party to be with you to be seated if there's no wait time",

I stopped in to Gen Korean BBQ & told the hostess I just wanted to order some \"to go food\".  She said...\"we don't do food to go!\" Startled at the response, I said, \"well if I bring my own container can I get it to go?\" Her response was...\"no, we do not let people take food out of our restaurant!\" Stunned, I asked...\"what if I eat some here & take the rest Home with me?\" She said \"no, you can not do that! You have to eat it all here! We do not let food leave the restaurant!\"  I find this mind set totally mind boggling!!!  So if you are unable to finish your meal but can't take leftovers with you, do they credit your bill for uneaten food or make you pay for the whole meal even though they won't let you keep the uneaten portion? I can't imagine this restaurant can operate like this!!!",

It too them way too long to even bring water, waited 20 minutes for the chadol, and didnt even get 2 of the meats I ordered. It looked like the table next to us got those meats instead of us. The waiter wasn't very apologetic either. Disappointing. You spend $24 on a meal you expect to at least get the food you ordered. Suffice it to say, no tip was earned or given.

    "text": "Little did I expect, Gen was located at a hip strip mall at Tempe Marketplace. The entire atmosphere, in fact, was surprising. It is much different from dining in an Asian food district; Gen is modern, trendy and loud. When I opened the door, I was greeted with blasting pop music and the aroma of Korean BBQ. I arrived shortly after 1:00 to  get lunch prices ending at 2:00 PM. Unfortunately, the hostess told me there was a forty-five minute wait, delaying my quest for Korean BBQ. They then asked for my phone number to text me when a table was available. This was a neat feature, allowing you to roam outside the restaurant instead of sticking around for your name to be called. The wait passed by quickly since there were many stores to peruse nearby. After forty-five minutes, my family and I were seated at one long table with grills for multiple parties. I would not recommend this if you are uncomfortable sitting close to your neighbor. I was okay for the most part, although my neighbor's plates and utensils kept sliding to our side. The lunch menu M-F is a great option even if you do not eat too much because it is only $15.99. Plus, Gen offers a huge variety of plates (about 32). To try more meats without fear of getting full, Gen allows you to order a half portion of a dish. This was an outstanding option since my mouth was watering for every item on the menu. My favorite dish, however, was the spicy octopus. It was harder to cook due to its shape, but it turned out deliciously after being cut up. Marinated in the traditional gochujang sauce, the flavor was spicy and vibrant. Their other meats were decent, but lacked marinades or seasoning. I did not mind the subtle taste since I enjoy natural smoky flavors as well. Gen provides dipping salts and an oil/sauce at the table to accompany these meats. On a different note, the service was incredibly efficient but not friendly. A couple instances, the waitress stood across the table to hear me order but had difficulty with all the noise. We both ended up frustrated with my orders getting lost in the Kpop music and my overall hardship of pronouncing the Korean dishes. Set the service standard to just taking orders and dropping off dishes. Ultimately, the food variety and prices make another visit worth it. If I happen to be around Tempe during the weekdays, I will definitely return to Gen.",

Not a fan of spicy but both of these foods have the right amount of spice. They're always busy, but I never have to wait longer than 45 minutes, which I think is pretty good considering it's a full house. Servers are kind and always come to check in if we want to order more",

We brought 6 people and we were cramped into one small table with one grill. We hardly had enough room to set plates, put the sides and drinks. While I love the concept, I refuse to sit like a sardine and be unable to enjoy my meal as I did in Torrance. The servers here were undeniably working their butts off. I actually felt bad. There needs to be a way to streamline the ordering process to where a single person walks around refilling meats so that the servers aren't running around like madmen. We would go long periods without any refills of meats and when you pay $150, it is super annoying. Dinner should be relaxed and enjoyable. Not chasing your server for meat refills. Still have yet to revisit.",

I see people on here complaining about servers not explaining how long to cook items, well it's not rocket science to know when something is cooked. Plus, all the meats are thinly sliced and cook within a minute or two. Honestly, it's common sense. Someone else also mentioned on here that they were annoyed the grills had to be swapped. Really!? Some of their meats are marinated in sweet sauces so if you think about it, of course the grill will start to char as sugar caramelizes and as a courtesy they swap it out with a clean grill. Without asking our waiter came and changed ours (about two or three different times to be exact cause we ordered a lot lol) and every time it heated up very quickly and we resumed our cooking. This place gives you two hours to eat all you want and let me tell you two hours is more then enough. Our drinks were always full and the server kept checking on us to see if there was something else we wanted to order or try. Put it this way, we enjoyed Gen's so much my mother and I went back today for lunch along with my aunt and cousin. They were very impressed and we all talked about our wonderful new experience the whole ride home. This place is AMAZING! Anyone on here complaining is overly picky, impatient, and/or have a predisposition to be negative. I will be coming back to this establishment very soon. Maybe even again tomorrow lol!",

There are a few AMAZING servers, and others are just ok. One thing I absolutely cannot stand is they consistently lie about their wait times to lure customers into the door and get them committed to wait for long amounts of time. Today I called from the Tempe marketplace parking lot they quoted me 15 minutes. It took me precisely 8 minute to get to the hostess and put myself on the list. Now the wait time is magically 30 minutes minimum. I spoke to the woman manager this time and she tried to say a rush of people came in within since I called. Didn't appear so in any way not even to mention it was completely unreasonable to assume so. The last time I brought this up to the male manager who was very nice about it was able to get me in around the time they quoted me. A lot of the servers in there know me because of the frequency in which I visit. I will be now driving an extra 15 minutes to Manna BBQ. Hopefully they appreciate my business and don't consistently lie about their wait times. This probably equates to a $500/mo loss in revenue for them not that they care.",

They took us to our table and we were amazed at the all you can eat (24.99 for dinner). Unfortunately they weren't serving any alcohol when we came. The ambience and scene were definitely more modern and the lights gave it a club like feeling. We tried the chadol and the cuts were prime and tasty. The high variety of preparations of pork belly (premium, red wine and smoked garlic) were definitely highlights. The bulgogi was sweetly marinated. All this meat was served with salad and traditional sides. In terms of service, they were attentive to our needs but it was slightly inconsistent in terms of timing of food coming out and ordering (i.e. We would order food and be asked if we want to order meat before our previous order comes out). Grill changers were frequent but inconsistent (one person put the oil in the center of the grill pan while another sprayed oil throughout) We also purchased macarons (which do not come with the all you can eat) and the flavor was good but a bit hard to eat (very solidified). Overall a great experience and I'm already making plans on returning and spreading the word :)",

We were done with our first round of orders & waited 20-30mins before we decided to flag down another server to place our next orders. The 2nd server took over our table and made sure we were taken cared of. At the end of our meal, our 1st server came by to apologize & that was nice. The food came out fast and the seafood was very fresh. They ran out of certain items tonight, so we will have to come back another time to try the bovine intestines. The ice cream macarons were delicious as well. Fun experience & very good food!",

They were very efficient to get us started so we ordered and got the grill going. While my husband added all the meats to the grill I glanced inside the grill and saw curly hairs and a long hairs on the grill. Right away we tried to get their attention trying to wave down anyone. Finally someone came and they offered to change the grill however the server asked \"do you want to keep the meat on here?\" I looked at him like are you really going to make us eat these meat that has hair on it! I was in awe on how they handles this situation. The server acted like it was our problem! And if course my husband didn't want to make a big deal and observed how they handled this situation. Mind you we dine many places and travel to eat so we know thibgs happen but its how you handle the situation to make it right. NOTHING WAS OFFERED, NO MANAGERS OR SUPERVISORS CAME.. no apology, nothing! We eat many places, if the food is good and issues happen and the establishment express their apology we will try them again however if food is okay and there are service issues etc. without any follow up or apology we will not be dining at their establishment again.",

The restaurant was immediately thrown into chaos as the electronic seating system went down and the wait staff took names by hand. We were seated. And then seated again. Again, organized chaos. I do not fault them, it's hard to get a handle on my duties at work after a year, let alone a month.  Once that was settled we finally set about gorging. The sides were brought out repeatedly and in short order. They weren't half bad either. Pay attention to the menu, like most AYCE lunch is not served on weekends. The meats were plentiful and delicious and we left smelling like a barbecue.  I doubt I'll be able to convince my party to come back anytime soon for fear of bursting but I will definitely try.",

Food was okay, nothing special, it's your typical Korean BBQ place. The serving size of sides are on small plates, maybe need more side variations. The service is good though, our waiter was very attentive and made recommendations which we appreciated. They have a rule that says you have to pay extra $5 for leftover but you don't get to take it with you because they don't have to-go boxes. It would have been okay to pay for it as long as you are able to take it home. We'll give it another try but not any time soon.",

Yes I did see some other kbbq's around but none I saw to my liking. Here at Gen, you cannot go wrong with quality and service. David my server was really working hard checking mine and the other tables around.  My only dissapointment was my second round of the bone in short ribs which were kind of chewy. But really i can forgive that. Next time just have better. But overall theres nothing out there in the valley right now that i would say is overall better than Gen when it comes to AYCE Kbbq. I do miss the OG in tustin but i see this will perfectly do. Keep up the good work Gen!",

We went on a Tuesday night just a little after 6pm right before the big rush came in. We were a little frustrated that even though we were only a couple of parties behind in line, it took almost 20 minutes just for them to take our names down on the list. But once it was our turn to put our name in, we were seated right away. But guess what? We were seated at the only table with the table light flickering on and off which was very annoying/distracting. But overall everything else was amazing and well worth it. Our server was on point making sure that our grill was consistently full of meat, grill replaced when needed and refreshments full. Im thinking round 2 in the near future. Maybe I'll try their lunch menu next time.  Lunch $15.99 Dinner $24.99.",

Been open a few weeks now. Went around 7pm for dinner. I didn't expect for it to be an 2 hour wait. Me and gf gave it a try, wasn't sure how long we waited but we waited will over an hour. If you don't waiting then I guess you're not having GEN for dinner lol. Food was great favorite was the intestine. Only complaint I have about this place is their drinking water, it taste like crap. Seriously they need a new filtration system or something. I suggest you get lemon with your water to kill that taste or soda etc. Overall this place is delicious. I would love to GEN 5 stars but I can't the drinking tasted bad. But I will come back for sure! Recommend for all AYCE KBBQ lovers.",

This location is part of the Tempe shopping center area so it's awesome because you can dine then shop or vice-versa with tons of parking spots for the shopping center.  It's a pretty big restaurant with attentive staff even though the meats come out slow when it's busy. You can order up to four items at once. It's priced at $24.99 per person which is reasonable for an AYCE place that has so many meat options. Some of the meats are brisket, beef tongue, NY strip steak, and pork belly.  Besides the wonderful meats that you can order from, the side dishes here are pretty excellent, including jap chae (stirfry clear noodles with veggies), beansprouts, and radish.",

So yes, we were bummed out, but we still really wanted to give it a try.  We returned in the middle of the day, on a non-holiday to be safe, and got right in. I loved it. My wife loved it. And our kids loved it. A homerun. The prices are fair for two hours of all-you-can-eat, especially before 3 pm when they go up a bit. The food is good, quality meats, and the accomodating sauces compliment them well. The service is also worth mentioning. They are attentive and helpful, answering those questions most people will have their first time at a Korean bbq place. And lastly, it's fun. There's something to be said about cooking your own food just how you like it, in a comfortable, hip/visually appealing, and well air conditioned setting.   I liked it enough to take some of my relatives there a few weeks later, and had a comparable experience to my first one with them. Needless to say, everyone wants to go back for more.",

    "text": "This was my first time visiting this restaurant. When I arrived at the place we realized that there is a 2 hour limit to reserving our table, which didn't make sense to me initially, but later on it did. This is a \"make your own meat\" kind of a BBQ place, where you order the pre-marinated raw meat, and cook it right in front of you. They serve generous portions of salads to accompany the meat as well, along with other sides. I really enjoyed their spicy pork, and we kept ordering that repeatedly. The great thing about this place is you can order 4 orders of meat at a time. The key though is to time your orders, otherwise, you can be waiting quite a bit for the server to arrive. But apart from the service (which could be a little faster and more prompt in my opinion), everything was great! :-)",

We were charged 24.99 (Say whaaaa???) We were not very happy bout that. : !  Service was adequate. ^_^  Not enough room on the table for food for 6 diners or elbow room. : !

AYCE is about $25 a person which is a great price for the selection of about 30 different types of meat/seafood to choose from. The sirloin was delicious with the brisket sauce on the table and I was a big fan of the cheese and jalapeno sauce to dip the meat in, make sure you ask for it! They offer many different types of beef, chicken, pork and seafood such as squid and octopus. There's original, Cajun and garlic marinated selections for most proteins and all of them were tasty! Service here was excellent, very attentive and we were constantly asked if we wanted more meat. All in all, it was a great experience.",

    "text": "Wow, wow and wow. This was my first time at a Korean barbecue place and I was blown away by the experience. I can tell you that it was worth the wait we had. Just walking into the place you can see that it is very modern. There is a bar in the back corner and in the other back corner is a huge screen project some videos. It's dimly lite but they had plenty of lighting around the barbecue to keep your food. It's not that loud inside and you can converse with your friends at the table easily.  The way Korean barbecue works is that you pay one price, per person, and an all you can eat menu for up to 2 hours. You order 3 items at a time. If you are not able to finish a large portion of the last round of food you will be charged an extra $5 for the dinner. This didn't happen to us, we ate every last piece of meat. :D  Employees here are fantastic. Always coming by to check if you want to order more food or if you need drinks. Our server did a splendid job. You could really feel the energy in the restaurant.  Such an amazing place. If you guys are around the Tempe Market place you have got to check it out. Remember to come hungry!",

    "text": "I give this place a one star because the location is great. To be able to catch a movie and shop in the same shopping center was amazing.   I have been to many Gen Korean locations and this by far was the worse. When we walked in we were greeted immediately, however, instead of asking me my son's age they based his cost off his height. So he is 9 but because he over 50 inches, we were charge adult rate. He doesn't eat even a kids portion but they charged him as an adult. Most Gen places based it off age.   Then we are seated in an area that was extremely dirty. The walls had splashes of food, the grill was filthy and the replacement grill which was suppose to be clean was dirty too. I asked them for an entire new setup and they replacement was just as dirty.   The meats were cut so thin that they stuck to the grill. The brisket was paper thin and lost it's form as soon as it hit the grill. It was shredded beef jerky by the time it cooked. The only good thing was the rice, it was cooked to perfection it wasn't soggy or dry.   I couldn't believe this was happening in a Korean restaurant. I have been all over the U.S. and I was in complete shock. I was delayed in Phoenix for a few days and really thought Gen was going to help. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I really hope they turn this place around because I've always loved Gen and had nothing but great experiences with the franchise.",

The wait staff was vigilant with bringing things timely, but we had to ask them to turn on the grill long after we got our raw meat, we had to ask for some utensil to cook it with.

They text you when your table is ready, and there is a bar in the back of the restaurant or you can walk around/shop at Tempe marketplace while you wait.  Our wait ended up being over an hour, which was a little frustrating (not sure if they take reservations ahead of time), but it was ok because we passed the time at the bar.  I cannot find the drink menu (alcoholic) online, but they had some fun drinks! There is one that is like an adult Capri Sun juice box, served in a large plastic see-through pouch with a light in it. I believe there are a few different flavors to choose from.  We also ordered the Korean wine, which was served in a glass, and we got to keep the remaining that was left in the small bottle to refill (probably about another glass or two).  Our party of seven was seated at a booth with only one grill, so that was a little hectic and a tight squeeze, but we made it work.  Our waitress was very attentive and efficient and kept our meat refills coming as needed, as well as had the grills swapped out for us several times.  Another thing I really liked, there are several options that you can order already cooked - KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) being one.  That helped us to all kinda keep eating while the grill was going.  Next time, if I go with that many people, I will definitely request a high top table with the two grills.  Other than that, great food and fun experience, and we were still able to eat a TON of food to get our money's worth. Definitely recommend!",

It did take us a little while to get the hang of it. I think it would be a lot easier if they gave you bigger plates along with a knife and fork. I am fine eating with chopsticks but not cutting steak with them lol. The meal was a little pricey but since it is all-you-can-eat meat you'll get your money's worth if you show up hungry.  Also fyi the floor is very slippery. I took a little tumble on my way to the bathroom since there was some stuff on the floor. Fortunately I was wearing flats so I didn't completely wipe out. But if I had been wearing heels I probably would have hurt myself. So watch out for that.",

    "text": "For November's International Supper Club, Gen Korean BBQ House was the place picked. Always wanted to try a Korean BBQ!   A few things upfront, they do not take reservations and your party needs to be there to be seated. Once you are seated your 2 hours of dinning start. Also, everyone at the table is considered a paying guest and will be charged the full price. There is a $5 charge per meat item left at the table not eaten and only 4 items ordered at a time, and yes the say its family style ordering, but the serving sizes of the meats are mainly for 2 max 3 people.  Hopefully yall are clear on the rules now, because we were not haha.    The restaurant is clean, very modern looking, and you would think if ever table was grilling that it would be smoky, but that's not even an issue, the place is clean and crisp and very eye appealing.     The grill is in the center of table and I feel our table setting was forgotten, I had noticed other tables had little condiments, like dipping sauces, spices of sorts, diced onions, pastes and oils, but our table did not. And even though we were on a 2-hour clock, 10 minutes seemed to past before our drink order was taken, and then forgotten about.  Granted it's a busy place, but you give your dinners a set time and put them on the clock, let's make sure service is on the ball.  We tried spicy chicken, garlic calamari, Korean Fried Chicken, Beef Bulgogi, Jap Chae, Shrimp, Gen Premium Steak, Gyoza, Flat Iron Steak, Red Wine Pork Belly, Hawaiian Chicken, Premium Pork Belly, and also had some white rice & salad.  The KFC was already cooked when served, it had great flavor, but it was cold, I don't really like cold fried chicken.  The beef bulgogi & jap chea were my favorites for the night!  Glad I tried Gen Korean BBQ and can see why its popular, and if I was with a group would wanted to try, I would go back.",

I don't want to strike too harsh on the food quality since it's ayce, and the price is pretty fair, but it could be better.  Anyway, the servers were very attentive, even though it was almost full when we were there. Very nice decorations and bar area which helps this place to retain 3 stars.",

When we sat down, our server (shawna) took a very long time to get to our table. When she comes she looks nervous and jittery, could not stop playing with the straws in her apron. She took 20mins to get our waters. Someone else actually brought waters for us. We had to stop other workers to change our grill and get us more side dishes. What annoyed me a little was the fact that I see our server standing in the back talking. It would be nice if she pays attention to her tables instead of talking with other workers. Overall, our experience was a mess. On a good note, we loved the food, it tasted amazing. I've never had korean bbq before so everything was very new for me. It's definitely worth the price and the wait. We will definitely come back for the food. Hopefully we get better service!",

My waiter was always around and asked if I was alright or if I needed anything. My only gripe is I was seated next to the clean up cart which kind of downed the experience a little. Maybe get rid of the table I was at so no one has to sit next to a pile of dirty dishes in the cart.  The food was great a lot of good choices. I had the galbi, spicy pork bulgogi, pork belly, premium chador, and some gyoza. As soon as I ordered my 4 and the food came out my waiter asked if I wanted to order anything right away. As I was eating alone I passed as I had a lot of food already in front of me.  I liked everything I ordered galbi, chadol, and the spicy pork bulgogi were probably my favorite. I didn't really care for the pork belly. Skip the pork belly to save room for the other meats.  All in all great place with great food I just wish I was at a different table. I'll be back again next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "I was really excited when Gen opened in Arizona. Having tried Gen in California few times, I knew what to expect. Having said that, I probably had high expectations. We didn't have any problem getting seated right away for Saturday lunch. We had party of 5 and one of the employees gave us a quick run down of the rules to follow (2 hour limit, 4 orders at a time, $5 charge per dishes of meat left, etc). Side dishes such as japchae, soontofu, and salad did not count towards the 4 orders at a time rule. Our meal started off great. Our waiter was very attentive, very quick to bring out the meat and change out the grill when it was dirty. However, half way through when they started getting busy, we had to flag down our waiter when we needed something. He came by less and less. My other concern was that each order was quite small. Having 5 of us eating, it was only enough for each of us to get 1 bite from each order. The size of dishes should vary depending on number in your party or allow more dishes to be ordered for bigger parties.  The quality of food and meat in general was compatible with what I experienced in California. I'm super happy about that. I will return every chance I get a korean bbq craving and $24.99 price point can't be beat.",

First of all they said the wait was from 1h to 1h30mins, both of us willing to wait because my bf really want to try out this place. We end up waited for 2hrs to be seated. The guy that serve our table was super nice, but unfortunately their food just ruin the whole experience. Meats are not fresh at all, lack of seasoning, not that much of side dishes. I can see why people are coming here, I guess because of their atmosphere. Beside that I don't see any good things about this restaurant. If you really want Korean bbq go to Manna BBQ is 10x better!!",

If we are paying top dollar, please keep your meat coming out the way you guys first started and don't jip us with that paper thin meat size. Come on!!! And rice paper, word on the street is you guys discontinued it? Come on!!! Best part to have with the meat besides rice .   Amazing place to eat k bbq!!! The decor inside is pretty awesome. The way they vent out the smoke from the grill is amazing because it does its job right and you don't smell smoke everywhere! The meat is amazing. It's fresh and you can tell it's amazing quality meat! Rice paper is always available. It's amazing with the bbq. Hawaiian steak is a must have!! I've gotta say this place is worth the wait. I did however took one star away because of the crazy wait! 2 hours long! Make sure they get your number 100% right so they can text you when your tables ready. It's super crazy in there with people waiting around in front of Barnes and nobles! LOL! Price is about 25 bucks per person, would recommend to go hungrryyy! It won't disappoint",

    "text": "Gen has never failed me on service and quality of food. Been too about 4 different locations in Cali.   I was worried about it here since we are in AZ and in CA was predominately Korean severs so they new how Korean BBQ worked and had that background. But this place was just as good or even better in some aspects in all around service.   I could not believe how tentative they were when we didn't even ask. It's like I turned around and they were their again asking if we needed anything. I was worried since they didn't have the service button at the tables like in Cali but we never even needed it even if we had it.   Grilled was changed on the spot with no wait and hassle. I think they took so long to open to really train everyone very well, like too well.   Our server **AMBER**, so you can see her name lol. Was awesome. Never misses a beat got our orders right, everything was refilled, it's like her life depended on it haha.   Basically what I am saying is this service today even on the grand opening weekend so more than superb and I will definitely come back.   The only bad hung is the dang wait but I assumed it on a Friday night. But they do an awesome text message so you can walk around TMP and kill time which we did at DNB so the hour and half was like nothing. We basically ran back when we got the text.   Now to the meat quality, it was on point just like any other GEN which I knew was not going to be an issue. They have a huge selection of stuff, dinner was like 38 items all included for 25 bucks.   Just go and you won't be disappointed, just assume a long wait so you don't get all bummed haha.",

I've been to multiple locations in California and to the one outside of Las Vegas - always great food and amazing service to follow.   Unfortunately I cannot say the same for this location. The food is good but quality definitely differs from the others. For example: the cuts of steak are thinner. Not too much of an issue though, as it is all you can eat. I understand that this location is new, however it's still frustrating that my friends and I had to wait at least 10-15 minutes to get greeted by our server and put in orders for food+beverages. Many times our orders didn't come out and drinks were not refilled so we had to ask our server again and again. It got to a point where we had multiple servers helping us, as our original girl was running so behind.   Also, being a regular at other Gen restaurants, I'm familiar with their payment policy. Three debit/credit cards to split and the rest may be paid cash. It is different here. You may either pay in all cash or split between three cards, not a mixture of both.   Overall, you can't get a better deal on AYCE KBBQ than at Gen so this is a good addition to Arizona if you can look past the lousy service.   Tip: go during lunch hours or grab an early dinner (before 7pm) to avoid long waits.",

It's a matter of them not knowing what their turnover time and not knowing what they are capable of handling. In addition, we were far from being the last table on the list and everyone after us was also turned away after the long wait. This is a very bad look for a nice looking restaurant. I hope they can get organized soon or they will steadily lose customers. We wasted three hours waiting for a table we should have been told would never be available up front. I'm very disappointed.",

We asked for a table for 2 and they just acted like they didn't want us to eat there and gave us an hour wait and I put my number in and it ended up being only a 15 minute wait, it almost seemed as if they wanted to drive us away by saying it'd be an hour wait. I just thought that was really unprofessional. That almost made us turn away but when we sat down, Sarah was amazing. She was very helpful in helping us order, was always on top of our refills, I even dropped my chop sticks and she was right on it. The food was delicious too, much more variety than other Korean BBQs and I will definitely be going back. The Hawaiian pork belly is to die for, the kimchi is amazing and the service was super fast.",

We were quoted a long wait each time but was seated earlier than estimated time each time. This is definitely a plus. All the servers were on point and friendly. The pouched drinks were fun and the food was good. Idk how I entirely feel about the side dishes at the moment but besides that; everything was awesome. I love the spicy pork belly!! I've been there three times already since they opened.",

The service was okay but it was no big deal because the vibes were still cool and the waiter was nice. My friends and I went on a Saturday at 5, waited only 45 minutes and when we got done (8pm) the wait was 2.5 hours. Sooo go early!  Anyways, I'm so excited Gen has finally opened! Definitely will be my go-to!",

Good atmosphere if you can overlook the fact that you're in a mall.  Side dishes were good, glass noodles yum! Meat is meat though Ive had better, more flavourful cuts.  Gangham has a little more authentic cuts and flavor that comes from the meat vs the sugary sauce. That and their generous Sharing of those cuts for less$ makes Gangham my #1.",

The first time was better than the last because our waitress was very attentive and made sure our side dishes and drinks were refilled and that we had more plates as soon as we ran out. The second time, our server rarely checked on us. We had to ask for water, serving plates, food plates, side dishes from any worker we saw. The food here is really good and you can have a really great experience, specially with a group, if you have good service. So I do recommend it, but wish you luck.",

We only discovered it two weeks before we moved out out of town and now I'm super bummed. We liked it so much we went twice in the span of 3 days.   The meats are great. The seasoned ones have good flavor. I was a big fan of their soondubu BUT I would pass on their japchae. If you come hungry the $25/head price tag is so worth it. Skip the rice so you don't get full and can have more meat. Also ask for salad! And sesame oil for your salt!   Service was great too! They come around a lot and ask if you need anything else, if you want to hang the grill, etc. highly recommend this place.",

Luckily I looked at the menu because it was the dinner menu (basically the lunch menu with a few additions) and not the lunch menu.  Lunch is 17 dollars which is kinda pricing for Tempe and dinner is 25 dollars.  Asked for the lunch menu and was told that since it's a holiday (Presidents Day!!!) they are charging the dinner price all day.  Asked to speak to manager and asked for reasonable accommodation and for lunch time to be lunch price.  For a group of 9 that's a lot of money for lunch.  He refused.  We left and went next door to Kabuki who didn't think that Presidents Day required a gouging of the lunch time crowd.  I will be back to Gen because I love the food but it no longer is my \"go to\" for visitors.",

We wondered around the marketplace until they texted us about 40 mins later. We checked in and they said oh your table will be another 5 mins, (then why did you text me and tell me it was ready?!?) Sat down at table 16 near the kitchen and bar and was told a someone would be with us to take our drink orders. After watching what felt like 75 people walk by and stare at us for a good 10 minutes still no one asked what we would like to drink. I flagged down the young girl that sat us and said that we have no seen our server yet and she said \"well I told her\" finally Carrie our server came to take our drink orders (ice water) and our food order. With that done we were ready to EAT! The food came out extremely fast and the drinks came out shortly after minus the ice so it was lukewarm water. Our first round of food we got the red wine pork belly which was extremely tasty and the brisket also tasty. The shrimp was bland and small (wouldn't waste your time). Carrie who was very friendly but a little scatterbrained came back to take another order and I specifically asked for ice water this time and again got NO ICE!! We ordered beef tongue and smoked pork belly the tongue was really thin and good the smoked belly was extremely chewy, our grill also seemed to be malfunctioning because the flame kept getting low despite being set on high. As we had a table near the kitchen I was able to see that they just had someone arrive with bags of ice and when Carrie came back I asked for ice and she finally said yeah we have been having a problem with that tonight. Overall the place is just a 2 some of the food is good the service for drinks is eh I expected better since they don't bring out the food or clear the plates. It was also difficult paying the check as Carrie seemed to go missing for about 10 minutes after dropping the check and before she picked up the card to run it. Sadly don't think I would waste my time coming back.",

When we arrived on a Tuesday night, the wait was 45-60 minutes. This place is at Tempe Marketplace so we left to walk around. The restaurant sent us a text when our table was ready, which was well within the estimated time frame. When we got inside, I was impressed by its clean and cool interior design. The table itself was was small, considering we usually have multiple plates on top of the grill, but I definitely liked the sunken-in design of the table. It made grabbing the food easy. The service was outstanding. This was my first time eating Korean BBQ in a long time, so our server provided us with a step-by-step guidance throughout dinner. He even grilled some of our food for us. That was so nice of him to do so! It is AYCE. The menu is a set fee per person. They list all the rules on the menu. The rules are pretty standard for BBQ places, but be sure to review them before you go to town. Also, their alcoholic drinks are humongous. I ordered some flavored soju, expecting a glass of it. No. I got a whole carafe. Despite how busy it was when I came, the employees did a pretty good job keeping the place clean. They did have employees walking around constantly to pick up used plates, replace our grill, etc...  This is definitely a great restaurant, and it is a fun experience. I highly recommend it. Be sure to arrive in advance or plan for a long wait accordingly.",

Thanks for being happy and vibrant. Anyone goes there try to sit in her section. Made it real easy for us to figure the system out. Atmosphere experience was great. Value was great. The only reason gave a four star is felt the quality of food could be better. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Gen is always great food wise. I have been to the one in California many times and by far beats this Arizona location. Never had any gratuity or pricing issues. Me and my girlfriends have been going since it's been open. I think we all have decided if it's only adults it's worth it and we do not have any issues with pricing or added gratuity for the little toddlers. Since most people write reviews when they have had a negative impact.. I guess this is why I'm leaving a review. Well this last visit maybe the server had something to do with this experience. He was good up until he added gratuity to our ticket when we had two baby to almost toddlers. His statement was \"well technically they are a body\" then to add on to that he dropped the check and stated \"Just a reminder the tip is a service charge that I do not get\" what the? Since when... I clarified and he said \"I only get 5% of that\" I was like uh ok... that should be up to you and the company then. But since I am great tipper and the service was quick other than that I decided to leave a tiny bit extra. My thoughts are well if this is how it's gonna be then we will only come here if we only plan an adult dinner. My daughter who is genetically tall but 9 years old was charged for an adult pricing. She's taller than 40inches... morale wise I feel like it's not ok. Any child under the age of 12 should be priced as a child regardless of genetic disposition. If that's the case they need to start charging adults double pricing based off of weight. It's pretty ridiculous. That's my rant on this place.",

This is similar to wait times at Gen Korean BBQ in Los Angeles.   That said, after you finally get seated, the food and service are amazing! The meats are marinated perfectly and sauces are simple, yet very tasty. The service is fast and accurate, and serving sizes are generous.  Despite the long wait times, I've gone back to Gen several times, both in LA and in Tempe, because the food is so good!",

It may be more efficient for them to clean, but it keeps the grill hot and the food gets a better char if it isn't changed. Wish they didn't ask us so many times, and while food is still on too!!! Another problem is that we had to wait a long time for the meat to come out. For some reason, the bulgogi on our second order didn't come with everything else and took a very long time to arrive.

First, the servicer was more concerned about making sure we knew the rules of the place than telling us about the food or actually servicing. He was more concerned that we knew it was a 2 hour time limit - and no one was in there! Felt rushed the whole time. Second, can't flavor anything - no oil, a tiny bowl of soy, a pinch of salt and pepper, that's it, so nothing had flavor. Utensils were useless - scissors and tongs. Third, price seems low until you realize until you have to add the pizza you got next door, cuz you are still hungry. I will say food came out fast but plates were cleared quickly slowly. Personally, I do not understand why anyone wants to pay to cook their own food but that's just me. But I do know that no one in my party plans to go back again!",

Don't get me wrong, the food is decent, though a bit on the saltier side. It would also be nice if they have more veggetable options for the grill. What really got us was the cleanliness of the place. It looks trendy and all, but the floor is very sticky. Moreover, we can't believe that this place doesn't have venting hoods over the tables -- for a BBQ place where you grill your own food at the table! I didn't notice any other ventilation setup either. When we first got there before the dinner rush, the place was already a bit smoky. When the dinner crowd hit, the smoke became a bit intolerable. I can't imagine it is good for your health either. We will not go back to this place unless the conditions are improved.",

The place was fantastic until they stopped serving the rice paper.  It's a Gen staple but here in Arizona they stopped. Why?  Because it wasn't cost efficient?  I don't know but it's a deal breaker for me.  They have rice which is not the same, but I realize it makes us fuller faster therefore we aren't supposed to order as much meat.  But something about the rice paper wrapped around a piece of meat dipped in their green tea salt and whatever that liquid sauce is, is the bomb!!  Alas, not anymore.  I have gone back 3 other times in hopes that my mind and taste buds would tell me that it would be okay to eat the grilled meats without the rice paper, but I can't, which is why I voted this place 3 stars.  Bring back the rice paper and Gen would be a solid 5 stars.",

Sides and dipping sauces/salty mix were set out before we were even seated.  Arrived at early lunch time on a Sunday. Dinner menu.  Loved cooking our own meat and veggies .  Would be a five if the salad and the white rice would have been excellent.  They were just good.  Really goody.  Would have been a five if all of the servers would have been present.  We wish he would have given more tips about being new there would have been awesome.  All drinks are extra.  Some special sides were brought but only after asking.  A great chain!",

This location is BRAND new so everything is pristine.  I love the decor of all Gens.  They've got lovely lights, vases, seating... This Gen in particular had a large projector screen for movies!  I went with a total group of 5 and we showed up before they had even opened - thank goodness we did! There was already a line forming when we got there, and by the time we actually got seated, there was an even longer line! I definitely would recommend getting there early AND making sure your whole party is present.  As previously mentioned, this location is new.  The staff is still training and they're still working out small logistics, so be patient! We had a great waiter, but he was seriously working his butt off (thanks Jackie!) trying to deal with his responsibilities while also helping others.  Despite how crazy it got, the staff was super friendly!  Definitely would recommend checking this place out.  I know I'll be going back again sometime in the near future.",

The meat is always fresh and well seasoned! The Hawaiian pork belly is sooo good, so is the ribs and the brisket. As far as seafood the shrimp doesn't come clean so it can get messy trying to eat the shrimp. For the price you pay, you get your worth!",

We got there at 2pm, the restaurant were pretty empty and there were no wait time. We were actually seated by our waitress at her table. It started with from the begining, we waited over 10 mins for just getting sesame oil and our drink. Our waiteress was NOT attentive AT ALL. We watch the other tables' waitress have checked her tables 3 times, but ours were no where to be found. My cup of drink were empty for over half and hour, still didn't see our waitress. We end up getting pretty frustrating because we want to order more food, but we can't, and our grill is getting burnt and smokey. So, we asked for the manager. But APPARENTLY  the manager does not care for talking to customers that wants to talk to them, because there were no manager come to our table even unti before we left. We were a party or 6, and they charge mandatory 18% service charge for the service we got? NOT WORTH IT. Honestly, i would not want to go to this restaurant again unless i got no other choice (which there are more and more AYCE kbbq in town now).  Oh! Btw, we did talked to our waitress at the end and told her it takes her rather long time for her to jyst get us something and she told us she have 12 tables to take care of. Which this seems to me sound like management is giving them a lot of table but they're not able to handle. Anyways, i would not drive over 45 mins from west valley to there again.",

There is a large variety of choices to choose from on the menu from pork to beef and even octopus! I don't recommend this place if you are vegan or vegetarian as it only has one veggie option and it only has onions and bell peppers in it. Other than that though, I recommend at least trying the beef tongue and getting the KFC! It's delicious. My only big complaint is that every time I have come here, the wait staff seems to fall short. My party always has to flag them down and they always seem irritated about being there. Another time I was there, a waiter completely forgot to bring a round of drinks but still charged them on the check.",

I've been there four times because 1. it's in Tempe Marketplace and if you're going to see a movie or go shop it's somewhere to pop right into. 2. it's a fun experience to cook your own food much like the KBBQ places in Los Angeles. And 3. the servers are rad as hell.   Tips:   If you go during lunch it's probably like $10 less? And you get basically the exact same items.  Get the sauces on the side and figure out which of the side items you find compliments your food best.   Turn the grill down a little bit and avoid the center unless you're just looking for a sear on the meat, otherwise your grill will burn up and they're going to have to change it constantly.  Pretty gosh damn Delicious. Enjoy it!",

Love how the place a had blue light theme to it. We had about a 10 minutes wait since it was just myself and two other friends. Once we sat down, at first, it took about 10-15 minutes for someone to come to us. The first person that came was just dropping off the sides. He didn't say anything, so we just stared until he left and then started nibbling. I was expecting him to at least tell us what he was putting down. After the first person came another person came by which was our server. He didn't mention his name or anything, just asked if we were ready to order. Sadly we didn't know what to do or how to do it. He explained quickly and got right to the orders. For drinks all of us got the Capri-sun drink(not the actual name). I was tasty, can definitely taste the alcohol, which we all liked. We started with 4 different meats to start and they came out fairly quickly. Server turn on the bbq and we went at it. Overall the meats were delicious we tried literally about everything. Top fave crispy fried Korean chicken and sirloin steak. We were thrown off in the beginning but the food and speed saved it. My friends and I will definitely be back. $27 bucks for all you can eat meat!! You really can't beat that unless you were an all you can eat buffet.   If their is one thing I would say is servers should engage more with the guest. Give name, ask if this is the first time, just give the experience. Of course the food is what we came for and that we're basically doing everything ourselves but engage me. Tell me what meats are good. What we should try, thing to try with the meats with. Specially if you want to help your tip.",

I like the white leather seating and blue lighting throughout the place. One thing that I would highly critique that may be a little bit nitpicking but with the dirty dishes being put maybe in the corner of the restaurant or somewhere else besides around 3 or 4 different tables and one of the wait staff kept dropping plates and was really loud; therefore if it wasn't near three or four different tables it wouldn't sound as obnoxious when someone keeps dropping plates like that.  Food. 30 something meats to choose from with a few items to order to be brought out already cooked and ready to eat. Great seasoned meats.   I would definitely recommend the place as it is a cute date spot whether it be lunch or dinner. The hostess needs to change her attitude; she acts as if her parents own the place and she is just a hostess and has no relation to the owners. If the owners or management reads this I think they know exactly the lady who I speak of and that needs to be corrected. Definitely unprofessional.",

I'll preface with the fact that the long 3 hours waits are gone so if you haven't been in awhile you don't have to fear about that anymore. I'll just write about my most recent visit which was only like a week ago. The only reason I didn't give the fifth star was because some friends of mine had got zero degrees down the way and were told to toss their drinks or take them to their cars because they don't allow outside food and drinks. Which I mean rules are rules but wouldn't you want people to fill up to eat less? Whatever not the end of the world for me. We had a larger group and it's usually 4 plates i believe at a time but our server Phillip was attentive and was on top of our group so we basically never had an empty grill or sides. That's pretty much the whole idea of AYCEKBBQ so the the review is basically for Phillip and myself since I was the main cook for our group so kudos to us. The location is tempe market place so I always tell my friends to park behind the kabuki/gen area or waste time in the front trying to fight for a spot. Also if you're a newbie to Gen remember to ask for extra green tea salt to season your premium steaks. Thank me later.",

    "text": "My boyfriend, a meat lover, suggested we try this place at Tempe Marketplace. Although I'm not much of a meat eater, it looked trendy and fun with good reviews, so I was good to go. We ended up waiting about 40 mins for a table on a fairly busy Sunday night.  Before you order, they will explain the very specific rules to you - set price per person ($24.99), four orders at a time, grill most things yourself, and don't leave leftovers unless you want to be charged. I was kind of put off by the last part... charged, for leftovers? But my boyfriend explained that it's more like a buffet, so if you order and don't eat it, they consider it wasted food (you can't take anything home). That being said, definitely take a few minutes between courses so you don't get charged unnecessarily.  On to the food: my favorites were the Hawaiian Steak, Gyoza dumplings, fried chicken, and the salad. His favorite was the Galbi, which is marinated bone-in short rib and available for dinner only. Since it's unlimited, portions are small, so you can order more of what you like and try as many things as possible. Even though I'm not big into meat, I still enjoyed trying most of the options. The meat is tender and marinated nicely. And since it's raw it comes out very quickly after ordered.  Finally, they offer ice cream sandwich desserts in green tea and fruity flavors - they were small and good! A nice ending to a substantial dinner.  Overall, this is a pretty cool place if this style of all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ is what you're looking for. It may not be exactly my thing, but I would come back again for a special occasion.",

It's located right next to Kabuki and across from Barnes and Nobles. I came here on a Tuesday night and our wait was 45 minutes. They do not take reservations so don't bother calling and just expect to wait about an hour to eat. You can shop to kill time and they will text you when your table is ready.  All you can eat for $25 with a maximum of 2 hours. They offer a variety of meats and side dishes ( salads, pickled onions, potato salad, spicy cucumber, radish and kimchi etc) You can order up to four meats at a time and order more as you go. The side dishes were on the small side but you can ask for more so it wasn't a big deal.   Our server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.",

Come hungry and leave slowly (cause you'll be wobbling out like a piggy)  All you can eat, lunch is 15.99 and dinner is 24.99 (Some stuff isnt included in lunch such as beef tongue and iron steaks). Rice is included in both.  Some waiters are cool and understand me and the boys like to keep the food coming, so they let you put in as many orders as you want. Some are more 'by the books' and limit you to four orders at a time. It's their loss because they'll be running around more. LOL  Only downside to the place is the service isn't amazing. The busboys are on point, but the waiters are okay. Me and the boys are always breaking our necks trying to find a waiter and they're all running around like chickens without a head. They probably need more staff on the floor. And the brisket always takes a while to come out for whatever reason.  But place is great. Me and the boys' personal record is 56 plates and counting between 4 people. We were told thats the #1 record right now and I got the receipt to prove it, so if you up for the challenge hit me up!!  -X  Edit:  Jan D a horrible server. I came with a party of 7 and this guy just couldn't get the orders straight. Half the orders we placed literally never came out at all.

    "text": "The staff totally made the experience at this BBQ house. Often if you try to visit a Korean BBQ spot the food takes a little while to come out, drinks aren't refilled as frequently etc.   Not the case here!  Their staff was on point just as much as their food. From the moment we sat down until the moment we left we were constantly checked in on, brought refills, etc. they even provided excellent suggestions based on what we shared we enjoyed off the menu.   You can't go wrong making this a night out. For first timers it is an all you can eat deal for $25 per person. But they aren't kidding when they say you get all you can eat. Whatever you want to try they will bring you. We didn't shy from the beef tongue or intestines.  Tongue was a much easier texture for me. My very favorite was (no surprise) the pork bulgogi.   Fun. Yummy. Great service.",

    "text": "Nine of us came here to celebrate my wife's birthday. When my mother-in-law called, they told her that they don't take reservations, but when we got there they said they had two large parties already scheduled for that night, so I'm still not clear as to whether they actually would have accepted a reservation if they had known the size of our group.  Because we didn't have a reservation they told us it would be an hour wait if we wanted to be split into two tables or a two hour wait to sit as one group at the high top tables. We opted for the hour wait and agreed to split into two groups. After nearly an hour had passed, and watching the Yelp app showing that we were nearly next on the list, we checked on our table. At that point they started to claim that it would be another hour before we could get in. It appeared that they were trying to wait for two tables to clear at the same time, rather than hold one open until a second one cleared. As a result, it seemed to me that other people were being sat before us. We almost left, but decided to give it a few more minutes. I don't know if they could that we were going to leave, but within 20 minutes we were notified that our tables were ready, although it still took another 10 minutes before we were actually seated. So, nearly 90 minutes after arriving we were finally ready to begin ordering.  The concept itself is fairly straightforward. There's a burner/hotplate/grill in the middle of the table, you order from the menu of 38 items, cook the items you order on the grill, and eat. The cost is $25 per person and it is all-you-can-eat. To ensure that you're eyes aren't bigger than your stomach, they will only allow you to order 4 items at a time, there is a two-hour time limit on how long you can stay at a table, and they charge you $5 for any items not eaten (basically a restocking charge).  As for the food, there are many options and it's fun to try new things. Among the more common items we tried were the garlic chicken, Korean Fried Chicken, pork belly, and calamari. The more exotic items included baby octopus, shrimp (with heads and tails still attached), and beef tongue. The expressions on my kids face were priceless as they put an octopus on the grill or learned to devein a shrimp, but they soldiered on actually really liked the food. My 12-year-old said his favorite was the spiced pork bulgogi while I enjoyed the beef tongue the best, although it was sliced so thin it didn't really have the typical tongue flavor.  Food service was fast although my one complaint was that every time you asked for a refill on your drink they took the entire glass and actually refilled and returned it which took a while. Come on, plastic glasses aren't that pricey and a restaurant should have enough so that your server can get you a new soda and remove your old one at the same time.  Also, they should really take reservations as they almost lost our entire business and we likely won't ever return because of the wait. Once we were in though, we did enjoy the food and the experience so if you don't mind waiting or just want to plan to do some shopping at Tempe Marketplace first, you may want to check it out.",

Instead of the traditional rice paper side dish, they have Finley sliced pickled radish disks, which serve the same purpose but are healthier.   The food was excellent. The place looks great too, except the bar area looks like an out-of-place afterthought. Definitely not a cool place to lounge if you're just looking to have some cocktails. This is definitely somewhere you go if you are hungry.",

They give you veeeery small portions for $24.99 which is their dinner AYCE (all you can eat). I took my girlfriend and niece who was visiting from CA and it cost $75 minus the drinks and tip. You would think with such high price the quality of the meat would be outstanding but in fact was not satisfying. In CA, I can find several kbbq at $11.99 AYCE or for the more expensive package not more than $17 $18. I understand we aren't in CA but this is why to me, my girlfriend and niece, is not worth spending your money at.",

The staffs were friendly, kind, helpful and quite attentive.    The quality of the food was quite decent, the meats come out quite fast so it's not long till the cookin' starts!  You can't take anything home, and if you waste food they charge you extra, so try not to let your eyes do the talking, which can be quite hard.  We tried a few steaks, short ribs, pork bellies, octopus and squids, jaws, claws and whatever we could get.  All were quite tasty.  I ate so much meats I was oily for the next few days.    The loo was quite clean and well kept.  Had to do a two to make room for the short ribs.  Well worth it.  The flush is slightly more powerful then the common house toilet.  Good loo, a decent loo, don't see why anyone should not use it to make more capacity so they can eat more.    Overall a great place with decent food, don't see why we wouldn't come back!  So go here and get your meats don't worry about rice or the sides on the table.",

So many great meats to choose from and you get two hours to eat at your hearts desire!  Came here on a Saturday night with a friend and was told it would be a 45 min wait. That's ok, it's in a mall with lots of things to do. Plan ahead and be prepared to wait a bit during their peak hours. They'll text you when your table is ready. The ambiance of this place is very hip, almost felt kind of like a night club.  Once you're seated you'll have a menu of meats to choose from that you can order in increments of 4 at a time.  If you order a plate and don't eat it, then it's a five dollar charge per plate! Make sure to eat it all and also order the next round of meats before your previous order is fully eaten to optimize the cadence of the meat train! My favorite dishes were the spicy pork belly, beef bulgogi, and the octopus!  Went into a meat coma way before the two hours was up! Will definitely be coming back!",

They took dishes away that had stuff still on them, took a soup that was half eaten when we were finished. No extra charges. Just order the 4 at a time and you'll be fine. Also, we did do SOME half portions when only one person wanted a certain item. That helped. I think the two of us tried about 16 items. Totally great. I'm hooked!

This place is always \"poppin'\", full of college kids, upper class socialites, and generally saavy \"fellow foodies\" who are \"in the know\"  My glowing review is a bit of an amalgamation of both visits.  Meats are of good quality, not the heaviest of deep spiced marinades like i prefer, but a balance of all things good that should please most palates. The 2 seasoning salts too will quell any overly sweet marinades like on the galbi (use them, a pinch adds punch).  Cheese corn seems to be a \"thing\" here in the local Az market, and of the 2 places where i've tried it, you guys get a slight edge, and i like selecting how long to leave on the heat.  Where i hail from - we're the land of dolsot bibimbap and soondubu paired with AYCE meats.  I would welcome some stone pot kimchi fried rice!and  Today, in addition to my usual samplings of all varieties of pork belly, chadol, etc, i tried a breaded pork, cheese stuffed pork katsu...maybe not authentic Korean, but damn, it was tasty! So much more to try...I need an aux stomach!  One quick note on ventilation: THEIRS WORKS QUITE WELL !!! (hint for the uninformed - it ducts under the table to common exhaust blowers, so no annoying overhead \"periscopes\" needed).  Thanks again Ian, and thanks GEN!  I will see you both again soon!",

AYCE that includes not only meat and seafood, but also some items cooked in the kitchen. Take note, you can only order 4 items at a time.   We ordered japchae, gyoza, and KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) from the kitchen, there were 6 of us, servings were small, each of us just had a bite of each item, the serving seemed to me, good for one person. So make sure to maybe triple up these items. We ordered their KFC a few times while we were there.   There was only a few banchan items - kimchi, pickled cucumber, pickled onions, edamame and mashed potato. I haven't seen mashed potato before as part of banchan. I've been to other KBBQ places that came with more banchan. No plain lettuce leaf, just lettuce salad.   We ordered a variety of meats including chicken and steak. Chicken and their steak are thicker cuts that will require longer cooking time. The rest are you typical thin sliced fast cooking meats. Personally the food was ok, even their Chadol (shaved beef brisket) was just ok. Chadol is one of my favorite meats for KBBQ, I wasn't feeling it that time.   In summary: good food, fun for groups, my favorite that night was their KFC. They do not take reservations. Service was great!",

Once seated, you have 2 hours to eat... all you can eat... but if you have left over food at your table when you check out, you will be charged extra.  The experience was cool, but we paid a lot of money to cook our own food at our table.  It wasn't anything special.  The ingredients weren't amazing.  The smoke in the restaurant from every table BBQing was intense and my eyes hurt.  Overall it was okay.  I certainly won't be returning because cooking my own food in a smoky room isn't really my bag... but it might be yours so give it a try.",

Yes, night club indeed as music was blaring and at times deafening!  Needless to say, if I had kids this is probably not your jam.  As a single dude just hanging with friends; this would be your vibe.    Moreover, for $24.99 and 2 hours of AYCE, Gen does a relatively good job of that.  Their cuts of meats came quite quickly and service overall is fun and upbeat.  I would say they have more options than what I'm used to and also their cuts seem to have a bit more quality then most Korean BBQ joints around the valley.  Their grill is generally set at the right temperature and we didn't need to meddle with it much; they also changed it only once.  I think the down side for me is their bowl of rice.  I'm used to getting more moist and stickier rice in a silver covered bowl, but they served plain steam rice.    In the end, I think Gen has some great food and a 2 hour window is more than enough.  My only knock is probably not knowing if I should get up and dance or eat.  Service was great except that we didn't get our usual Korean side dishes to start as I gather they simply forgot ours tonight.  Prime cuts would be over exaggerated, but again better than most I've experienced. - Enjoy!",

Located in the Tempe marketplace (opposite the Barnes and noble), it offers a trendy ambience, centralized location, and fabulous food.  In addition to the usual list of bulbogi beef/pork, ribeye, pork belly and seafood, they also offer a \"Korean fried chicken,\" which is essentially an extra crispy orange chicken. Absolutely delicious. There's  also a very spicy version of the fried chicken but that's not for the faint of heart. There are many Korean bbq places in Tempe/Mesa area, but this restaurant is a cut above the rest.",

Reasonable prices, relatively quick service, a fine assortment of fresh meats and seafood, and all the accompaniments that should go along with the KBBQ meal!  AYCE KBBQ is really more of an experience than just a meal.  And it is wonderful for fun social gatherings with friends and family.  Conversation topics can include, among others, how you like your meat prepared... or how much meat you can fit in your mouth... which meat is your favorite... or how hot you like your meat when you put it in your mouth!    Lunch prices are about $17 per person... and dinner is around $25 per person.  For the amount of food that you get and the preparation that goes into slicing and marinating meats, I feel like it's a fair price provided that everyone is hungry and ready to eat.  As a chain restaurant, Gen has enough experience and processes in place to ensure that you're getting fresh ingredients, consistent service, and a similar experience each time.  I like that.    *****FIVE STARS****",

Service was fine, sometimes a little slow with requests. However, every Korean BBQ place has their servers overworked, so it's just as expected. A big difference as compared to other location is that it's more crowded and always loud, probably because there's not a lot of KBBQ places around Tempe.",

When we finally got our location here in Tempe i could not have been more excited! This location never disappoints. Same vibrant energy in the restaurant without the excessive lines/waiting of the socal locations.  You give the number of the party to the host, she seats you and the fun begins immediately. Korean BBQ involves cooking your own meats/poultry/seafood on a gas grill set into your table. A great menu allows you to choose traditional items such as bulgogi and beef tongue to more americanized items like KFC (Korean fried chicken) hahaha! Most traditional cuts are very thin and cook quickly, it takes very little time on the grill and of course we never want to over cook out meat!!! Make sure to order the salad and load up on that, its for aiding in digestion and also helps you be able to eat more meat! The setup here is all you can eat so get ready to load up on the best korean bbq quality meats in the valley, an impressive variety and a very fun place to enjoy good company and great times. I will continue to be a regular!",

She would forget time and time again to the point that I was close to just leaving without bothering to pay. Even after all the times she would forget or jack up our order I would still say \"thank you\" and she wouldn't even reply with a \"you're welcome\", she would just roll her eyes and walk away. WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THANK YOU, REPLY WITH \"YOURE WELCOME\"!  I can go on about our experience tonight with our waitress chloe but my thumbs are starting to hurt just typing this and I'm short on time. But I will add this last part about our experience. She seemed pretty damn quick to give us the bill. We all know that feeling when someone places the bill in front of you that you kinda feel rushed, yeah,  not a cool feeling.

The meat was not the best either.  I didn't like that the music they play was explicit being a family restaurant. I don't usually mind old school music but use clean version especially with little kids around. Servers were friendly I can't remember the name of the girl that we had but she was good.

The wait time was really long, but that was expected since they opened just a couple days ago. The food and service was great! All of the employees were friendly, and the meat came out so fast. We had no issues whatsoever. The only sad part was they had no alcohol. I was told that they will after their grand opening, though! I can't wait to go back again. :)",

They obviously need improvements on the front desk part where they mix people with and without reservations into one line.. and they have 2 staffs!!   However as management went, we sat in the seats closest to the bathroom (under the projected movie screen) and there was this man doing Absolutely nothing but starring towards the customers (us) throughout the whole meal. I felt bad for the workers who were working their butts off for immediate service (yes everything went really quickly) and probably got paid less than this supervisor. We needed help a few times but who came to our aide? Not this guy. I would expect such a place to have an office to hide him in during busy hours.   Also and again related to management there was a review for someone who's burnt pots got cleaned, no question asked? We had a woman in heels and pencil skirt who came by and scolded us on burning the pot--she did not seem happy but bitter as the burnt pot. I know we look Korean but that doesn't mean we know how to use the pot and not burn the food without the waiters teaching us. I dont think its our responsibility to fix the stove temperature especially as a beginner but apparently it was set too high and she fixed it as she warned us. Thank you but No thank you!!",

I asked for more potatoes and kim chi radish 2 times during a 30 min time frame. I didn't receive it until I asked a 3 rd time and even then it was an additional 5 minute wait.

I came in for lunch while I was waiting for my car that was getting serviced down the road, as I walk in the hostess very loudly announces \"party of one!\" The entire staff then shouts \"welcome to Gen\". Okay this is corny as all hell and it was the only annoying part about this place.  To the good stuff now. This place is straight forward, 16.99 all you can eat up to two hours during lunch and if you have any leftovers you have to pay a $5 penalty. Not bad.  I started it off with a \"premium\" steak, which is essentially a top sirloin, I also got pork belly, beef bulgogi, gyoza and a side of rice. I literally had to muscle through at the end but this stuff was not only good but worth the price of admission. This is a cool spot to go with a small group because the inherent interactive nature of Korean BBQ. The service is top notch as well. Gen is a winner, even if it's a chain.  My advice though: stop with the \"welcome to Gen\".",

I would stay away from the wine as it's cheap and hot. The Mai Tais are life!!! For the True heat seekers, I would get the Volcano Chicken but ask for the sauce on the side! Always order the Galbi beef and the bulgogi.... The shrimp is blandly season.... Unless you're like me and order the cajun shrimp but cook it with the volcano shrimp ( wait.... did I just create something ) !!!!",

Service is fast and friendly. It's a nice place for a special Occassion but honestly, with 5 people that's a total of $125 (without drinks) and you could have a bbq at home.

She gave us recommendations on what to order since their menu is expansive. We had a grill change once, but upon request, we got it changed as many times as needed.

Rather than juvenile or mature specimens, they bring out these succulent little babies good for 2-3 bites each. They cook fast, and go down oh so nice! Mid-week lunch is the super value for about $16, but yes there is no doubt dinner price is still worth it, plus you get several more options. I think all of the ban-chan provided to me were also quite tasty. Make sure you ask for the radish wraps. Those are larges slices to wrap around your meats for added cooling, and crunch.   Atmosphere? Well, think of a singles bar with overhead videos, open ,airy, and somewhat boisterous. Definitely a millenial-bias to the crowd, LOL.",

We arrived a little after 5 and only waited for 20 minutes.  We were seated at a booth with a grill in the middle, sides were already set, waiting for us. The sides included pickled radish, potato salad, pickled cucumber (no, not pickles), Cole slaw, kimchi, edamame, and pickled onions. There's also seasoning dishes already served as well. Our server promptly came to take our order - we were not ready for that yet, but ordered drinks. Also found out you can order unlimited sides which includes salad and rice.  He returned and explained its all you can eat in a 2 hour time frame, you can select up to 4 meats, they bring it to your table, and cook it on the grill. We ordered garlic calamari, the #7 special of marinated sliced beef, beef sorry ribs, and Cajun shrimp. I wasn't very fond of the calamari but both the beef dishes and shrimp were delicious. Our next round consisted of garlic chicken, Hawaiian chicken, sliced beef brisket, and flat iron steak. Beef seems the way to go. Just wasn't feeling the chicken - altho the garlic chicken had an awesome jalapeno fondue sauce that accompanied.  We got a third round of meats and called it good. Very satisfied and happy. The service was superb. They come by to clean plates off and bring fresh grills after you've used it for each round.  My hubby is a body builder and he ate like a champ - hard to believe 2 hours isn't enough time to stuff your face unless you're completely overdoing it.  Fun atmosphere, great service, and good food.",

Look if you need more than two hours to stuff your face you either didn't eat fast enough or are the biggest glutton ever. 2 hours for all you can eat is not only insane it's also amazing. Hahahaha.   I stumbled upon this place as I live in more of the north valley. I liked the vibe, ambience, and the food was good. Our server David S. was on point. One because we have the same name but he was totally cool and also took great care of us. Definitely 5 stars for him all day long.  The meats were good. I have had all you can eat and this was better than the other place up in north Scottsdale.   For two people we got 10 items and we were stuffed. The bulgogi is necessary always and you have to just try it anywhere they serve it. The steak was good. Gyoza was also tasty. Oh the KFC and Volcano Chicken were amazing. The Volcano chicken was spicy but perfect for me. Great great flavor but do not get it if you don't like spice. Flat iron steak was thinly sliced and you have to cook it in the middle. Galbi was also tasty. The Hawaiian steak was also good and they have a nice piece of pineapple to go with it.   They also had unfiltered sake. Yaaaaaa!!!  Only thing is I wish the condiment sides were a tad better tasting and more variety but they were still good.   Again, David S was awesome and everything came out quick and there was plenty of food. Will be back for sure.",

It's also a fun experience to be the chef who is cooking and then you can eat it while it's still hot. You can cook it to your liking and we like to season the meat with the salts and dipping seasonings. It's a popular place and it's good for lunch and dinner and for the family. We're always looking for new places to eat, but this is always a choice when we're looking for a place to eat.",

The customer service here it's decent overall.  We had the pleasure to meet one of their managers on site Mr. Giovanni he was always attentive to everyone while we were there, walking around from table to table making sure the experience was great for everyone.

For example we waited an hr and 15 for a table of 3! The good thing is that it is located in Tempe market place so there are a ton of shopping spots and bars around to keep you occupied while waiting! Another big thing to know is that if you do not check back in within ten minutes after your table is ready, they will give away your table!   A few of my favorites: Beef bulgogi Top Sirloin steak  Beef brisket  KFC - comes cooked  Hawaiian chicken (takes long to cook)     I also tried the chicken gyoza, personally I felt it was dry but hey it's all you can eat so why not try it hehe:)   Service was great and bathrooms were clean, just be prepared to do some cooking and enjoy:)",

KBBQ has made a boom over the past year in the East Valley and of the pickings Gen is one of the top fighters.  The service is fantastic! Very kind, and always making sure that you are happy. If it's your first time they describe the rules clearly and I've noticed depending on the staff and time they can flex on the rules a bit.  The ambiance is a bit clubby with lighting that is dark, and loud music but this is minor for me as the food is what I'm vibing with.  On the menu, they have lots of options for proteins, veggies, and kitchen items. Order 4 at a time and as soon as they come back order your next set to minimize your wait time. If you're hungry shoot for the thin quick cook meats or kitchen items.   My favorites are the premium steak, flat iron, wine pork belly, jap chae, and volcano chicken (the heat builds up pretty quickly on this!)  The drinks, other than water are not included in the ayce. The water used to taste really interesting but has since improved. I've ordered hot tea a few times and half the time it is luke warm.  Only gripes are that I wish rice paper was available and banchan sizes were larger so I wouldn't have to ask for refills so often :)",

    "text": "Everything was so exceptional! It's difficult to explain WHY the thinly sliced steak, chicken pieces and vegetables (mushrooms, sweet red bell peppers, even regular onion slices) tasted so outstanding. It's obviously because the meat is seasoned and marinated wonderfully, the vegetables take on the flavor of the meat's juices, and the grill is \"magical\". Haha  You can see in the photos and my video that the round \"grill\" is recessed into the middle of the table, and there's rarely any flames. I'm not sure if many people know this, but you can adjust the temperature on the end of the table. (See the photo of the knob.) I recommend the hottest setting. The best tip that I have for you is to keep in mind (when ordering) that the chicken pieces take longer to cook that the thin steak slices, so you want to get them cooking while you enjoy (and I mean be amazed) by the steak. It's wagu tender and so flavorful, yet you do have 3 dipping dishes in front of you, if you'd like to lightly dab into a special soy sauce, regular salt and pepper blend or special salt.   There are meat scissors to cut the raw meat into your desired \"bite size\" pieces, and everything's eaten with chopsticks, even salad and slaw, but you've got this.  It was sort of strange that all of the tables were set with the tiny sides already out on the table, like slaw, as I just walked past, but it was nice to have the edamame already there. The slaw is the mayo-type & was great to cool down my tongue after a spicy bite. You can get as many refills of any of these too.  The price is amazing! For $25, you can eat to your heart's and stomach's content for 2 hours!   Some people turn down the salad, rice and skip the sides figuring that they'd rather \"get their money's worth\" on the meat, but I suggest to say yes and have them there on the table even if you just want a nibble. It doesn't count for your \"4 dishes at a time.\" And the salad (dressing) was great!  You can only order 4 entrees at a time, but you can order the next four as soon as you can grab your server again. The servers and all of staff are very friendly.",

You are seated in booths with a hot grill just waiting to be used (the knob is on the front of the table where you can adjust the heat setting). Already waiting are several little dishes that are used to add FLAVOR and SEASONING to keep everything rich!   We ordered SO MUCH food (all you can eat for $25 per person? Yes please!). The CHICKEN was one of our favorites and so was the FLAT IRON STEAK! You also get served a bowl of rice and salad to go with all the protein! It was A LOT of fun being able to grill especially because you can cook it to how you like it!   The vents are amazing too, it keeps the place from becoming too smoky! The staff was so friendly and attentive! We went for a birthday dinner but I think this place is great for ALL OCCASIONS!   If I could describe Gen in one sentence it would be: your meat, your way!  I'm definitely going to be back to try more!",

The staff is lightening fast and gets you going right away. The grill is not charcoal which is probably the only downside to the whole experience but the food comes out delicious anyways. Warning, you will leave smelling like food. But you can't beat this experience.   The menu has a long list of all you can eat items for $24.99. To me this is absurd, but in a great way. You can only order four items at a time. You want your brain to catch up to your stomach as you shove food into your mouth all night. We had the short ribs, pineapple pork, top beef sirloin. Along with a fried chicken dish from the chicken (tasted like orange chicken)    My friend ordered a bunch of items since he's been here before. The food was amazing and I honestly didn't have one bad item. Our server was friendly and amazing. No doggie bags here, so eat what you can but don't waste food or else you will be charged. There is a two hour time limit per sitting. Overall, dinner for two with a bottle of cold unfiltered sake was $80 with the tip. You can't touch that price where I'm from.   I will be back soon when I'm in the area.

    "text": "Gen Korean BBQ House is located inside Tempe Marketplace.  It is always busy, so wither make a reservation, or be prepared for a short wait.  The restaurant is clean, and not overly smoky, despite the number of grills going.  There is nothing special about the BBQ part.  It is on par with others, and runs on the more expensive end as far as price.  There are many selections on the menu, including your standard bulgogis.  I found that when you order the vegetables, you get hardly anything, and it is mostly devil apples (onions), which you all know that I abhor.  A few mushrooms, and not too much else.  The meat is plentiful, with lots of runners throughout the business.  This is good, because you don't have a long wait if your server is busy.  I will add, however, that our beverages were only refilled once, after waiting what seemed like forever.  When you had a salt-dehydrated mouth, waiting for a refill, and then never getting another one, is awful.  Overall, Gen is a great place for Korean BBQ, especially as a means of introducing it to folks.",

The overall experience of cooking your own food was entertaining.  All you can eat meat! Can't beat that. Location is perfect because there normally a long wait so we have plenty of options to grab drinks, shop or people watch before dinner.  Great menu!   Cons: The service was just ok. Our hostess and waiters honestly didn't seem happy to be at work.  Not a great place if you don't eat a lot like me & my husband.  Very smoky and caused us a lot of coughing. Noticed this happens when grills need to be changed.  $5 a plate rule is strange for uncooked food.... Especially since you can't take any doggy bags  I would take someone again just for the experience but this place e isn't going on my must-go/regulars list.",

She made sure our waters were never empty and our orders were placed correctly and brought to us so quickly! She gave us great recommendations on what to order next and answered all our questions so nicely. (Some of the servers there could learn a thing or two from MJ!)   The food was great, as usual! Spicy baby octopus is my fave! It looks a little creepy but the flavor is all there, you have to try it! Just be sure to cook it fully or it'll be too rubbery.   All in all, my last visit at Gen was a 5/5!",

HOWEVER, I went with four of my friends today and it was disgusting!   Towards the end of your meals, we decided to try some calamari, and we found hairS in there. Not one but THREE HAIRS!  I noticed a hair when we begins to drop the calamari on the cooking pan... and my friend found another one, and you know what happen.   Long story short We got the attention of our server, she looks shocked, disgusted, and felt bad. And then the manager came.   Worst part: Manager: Where is the hair?  Us: Showing him  Manager: That doesn't look like hair to me  Us: ?!??! Looks like hair to us Manager: It looks like some cooked shrimp's tentacles.  (took the evidence away that we handed him)   Good that I took some pictures before he came to \"help\" us.   Please let me know we are not the only one that thinks that's hair, the end of the top even looks like the follicle.   We're pretty disappointed that they won't even admit or apologize.... or else I wouldn't have posted this.",

Banchan ( side dishes) was average although homemade kimchee was pretty good. Our  premium sirloin steak was tough no matter what temperature we cooked it. The soon dubu/tofu soup was underwhelming. The servers were friendly but forgot some orders and unlike previous visit, we had to flag someone to change out our burnt grills or to  clear empty dishes. The atmosphere is a  clean modern vibe but music too loud for conversing.  The only thing that was a  negative was our wait,  because we never received a call/text that our table was ready. They said sometimes calls might not go through at the mall which they should let us be aware of. Anyway, they got us right in afterwards.  We mostly enjoyed it and would definitely come back.",

The environment is ok, the downside is they don't take reservations. Good for hang out spot with family and friends, although I wish they have good ventilation for the smoke. If you showered and come here it's a pretty bad idea because you will be smell like bbq all over even if you're just waiting to be seated in the waiting area. I feel like the music play pretty loud so it's hard to talk to people and it's also hard for people to listen to you as well. You pretty much have to raise your voice the whole entire time.   The food is the best in overall because you can get 37 items on the menu for 24.99/person for dinner and also the best side dishes.   I would definitely recommend this place for a good Korean BBQ but I would warn them about the smoke and coming out smelling like the restaurant as well.",

He came over maybe 5 times out of the whole meal. Which was odd to me, we got the wrong drinks, and he didn't explain anything as far cooking goes. We figured it out alone.   We'll come back for sure with more knowledge is all.",

We went on a Saturday night and had about an hour and half wait. They do accept reservations per their website though. Every time we have been by this place it's incredibly packed so we just walked around the mall while we waited for the text that our table was ready.   We sat down and our waitress came up and explained the process. You get 4 meats at a time and if you have any leftovers then you will be charged so make sure you order accordingly!! Our waitress was great and everyone had great customer service. From the waitress, to the hostesses, to the people bringing our food and to the people picking up the used dishes. Everyone was great!!    The food itself was amazing!!! You cook it yourself so it's really fun and interactive when you have a group. One thing I wish was included either on the menu or with the meat is recommended cooking times or techniques for some of the items. We tried new things we have never had before like beef tongue and we weren't really sure how to cook it and messed it up first couple of times.  Everything we had was really good.   All in all, this is a great place!!! With two people eating and drinking 1 beer each and 1 soda each. It was about 85 dollars with a tip.",

However, I give it 4 stars because: first, the service was a little bit slow. Second, the grills were not well oiled and burnt very quickly. We had to ask for 3/4 grill changes over the course of our meal. Third, I believe the place could benefit from over grill fans. The ventilation was not great.",

I've been there for dinner and lunch on busy and off-times (even came opening night!), but somehow I always end up hailing a waiter for something that is very basic. Basic server duties are lacking like: after being sat we won't be served sides unless we ask, or having to request they pour sauce into the dishes.  Everyone is usually very nice, but I wish they would just remember the little things. It would push the experience to 5 stars.",

He walked us through the menu and also told us there were unlimited sides we could order from. He came back and forth to check up on us and asked if we needed refills, the grill changed, and basically he was always there. Thank you so much for taking care and helping my family and I tonight and also celebrating 2 birthdays. Sadly they ran out of the intestines but that's okay! Still eating so I'll send pictures soon!

Our fav was the Pork Bulgogi!!! #4 - Service was very attentive; and this was a first - they changed out our grill top so we didn't have to cook on a charred grill halfway through :)",

The longest we waited for anything was under 30 seconds from the moment we realized we wanted it to delivery.  We had our drink and food order in in seconds, when our sides were delivered.  At most 20 seconds later, we had our waters and our meats.  They replaced our burnt-on cooking surface twice without being asked.  I'd suggest a specific meat, but they were all great and we went overboard and tried a lot.  The spicy pork bulgogi was the best, but it is always my favorite.  We will be back.",

The food is awesome! They let you choose 4 items at a time, but you can get anything you want. I was thrown off that weekends are at dinner menu pricing so beware if you come for lunch and expect to pay $15.99. Service was great and everyone was very helpful and welcoming! Every server seems to be very attentive and quick. Definitely try this place out!",

    "text": "Finally a legit Korean BBQ restaurant has opened in Arizona!   Dinner and weekend pricing for the AYCE BBQ is $25 with 37 items on the menu. Some of the favorites were the flat iron steak, galbi, the beef tongue, and the Cajun shrimp. The soondoobu was also really really good!   The service was friendly, attentive and prompt. There was someone ready to change our grill the moment it got even a little blackened. Our server was always present to take our order without being obtrusive. If I could give a 10 star rating for their service, I would!  The decor of the restaurant was modern and very welcoming. Unlike other Korean BBQ restaurants, the ventilation was superb with the vents positioned right next to the grill (genius!)   I highly recommend everyone to come check out Gen! Come before they open if you don't want to wait! If you thought other places in Arizona were good, then prepare to have your mind blown by Gen!!",

Keep in mind a lot of the items like the pork belly have different flavors (Cajun, Spicy) that is considered separate items. I've been to a number of ACYE Korean BBQs, but this place has the quickest turnaround for getting the meat.  I loved how quickly the food got delivered to the table.",

They had an expansive list of options and explained the procedure of ordering raw/prepared food. There were some rules in regard to how many can be ordered at one time and they strongly discouraged wasting food (or there will be a fee). We had a blast, customer service was great, and the food was delicious. I'm going to be sure to come again!",

The service was a bit spotty and we had to wait a little bit to flag down our waiter for the next order, so make sure to decide on the next round of dishes ahead of time. They will change your grill if requested. Compared to Manna BBQ, this restaurant has smaller portions (which are more manageable) and less banchan, but is still delicious overall. I also thought the bulgogi here was better than Manna's bulgogi. The Korean Fried Chicken tasted like Panda Express Orange Chicken; nothing too special. Try the Gen Signature Premium Steak instead!",

All you can eat dinner for $25 and the food selection is great, as well as side dishes and sauces.   The best part about our experience was the service. We were told that our wait was an hour and a half, and in exactly 90 minutes we were notified via text that our table was ready. The hostess, waitress, manager and other staff members were all friendly and very attentive. They had a number of staff members patrolling the tables  to take away empty plates, replace the grill, refill drinks and our waitress cake by at appropriate times to check on us. With it being only their 3rd day of being open, and being very busy, they were staffed and organized and was able to provide amazing customer service. I'll definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "I'm just going to keep it real about this Korean BBQ place. First off, if you are looking for the restaurant in google maps it's going to guide you to the other side of Tempe market place by Harkin's, when Gen is really located across from Barnes and Nobles.  Walking into the restaurant you can tell they put a lot of thought into the design. They have blue light running through every booth in the house with a big projector screen showing movies in the back. As we were seated we noticed their choice of music was on point. We could hear some Old school hip hop and other favorites which was awesome! When looking at the menu you will see a full list of different meats they have from short ribs, steak, chicken, pork and much more. Mind you this is an all you can eat restaurant and the price is 24.99 per person for dinner . We started of with the Hawaiian chicken, spicy chicken, shrimp and bulgogi. The meat all comes out raw and you cook the meat on a small grill in the middle of the table. The quality of meat they bring out is pretty good. We were impressed with every style meat we ordered. I think my fiance and I sat for about 2 hours and enjoyed about 10 or 15 different marinated meats along with salad and rice. The service in this place is very good, they are very attentive and friendly and they make sure you are well taken care of.  If you haven't got a chance to have Korean BBQ I would defiantly recommend this place. I know there is only about 2 of these restaurants in Phoenix that have popped up this year. If you're open minded with trying different food give this place a try, just make sure you get here early cause the wait can exceed 30 minutes.",

    "text": "Things people in AZ that need to understand about all you can eat Kbbq:  -Long waits to be seated (1.5 - 3 hrs dinner, idk about lunch) so plan ahead. If its getting close to closing time, you probably won't be seated. This has happened to me a few times in Kbbq places in CA. Get use to it. -You cook your own food -No reservations (usually, but I don't know if they can for a certain amount of people.10+?)  I've heard some complaints about the above, but these people clearly have not gone to an all you can eat kbbq.  I haven't been to Gen in CA but I have friends who have and I myself have been to a ton of Kbbq places since I've lived in CA for a long time. At first I had low expectations since it was a chain and it's Arizona, but I was impressed. Yes, at times they were slow, but hey they recently opened and still testing the waters.  Overall, the place is clean. Very hip decor and they played some good music. Very loud due to crowds. Probably won't recommend kids going here unless they are obedient.  Food wise I would recommend the red wine pork and the steak (the first one on the dinner menu). Also the Korean fried chicken and the volcano chicken were pretty tasty. It was a bonus that this was all you can eat too!  I hope this place is here to stay!",

    "text": "I was so excited when I found out that there would be a Gen KBBQ in Phoenix. It was one of my favourite places for KBBQ when I was living in LA (even though there are lot of more authentic ones in KTown there). I finally came here about a month or two after it opened, and I was so ready to cook my favourite marinated meats, wrap them up in rice paper, and savour the delicious flavour. But upon arrival, I was immediately disappointed because there is NO RICE PAPER. I know that KBBQ is all about the meat, for me, the rice paper to wrap it in is just as important, and I have never been to a KBBQ that straight up did not have rice paper at all. This was the number one thing that peeved me, and I would say that it ruined the experience. There was another thing that I was horrified about, but I can't fully remember. I want to say that it was a lack of spicy, sticky rolls on their menu. This was one of my favourite dishes to order at Gen LA. It was a perfect little dish to cleanse the palate when you are way too full of meat. But alas, Gen in Tempe lacked this too.  Nonetheless, here are some general things to keep in mind at Gen: - Come for lunch because it is a lot cheaper than dinner, and the menus only differ by 5 items, which doesn't make much difference; weekend lunch costs the same as regular dinner though. - My favourites are the beef bulgolgi, Hawaiian beef, and brisket; there are a lot of other excellent stuff on the menu, but these are staples. - I think they charge you for rice; that was probably the other thing that disappointed me (and not the lack of rice rolls). I wouldn't order rice for KBBQ, but if they're not going to provide rice paper, AND they charge for bowls of rice, that is just plain ridiculous. - Don't order more than you can eat, because they will charge you for leftovers. - Gen always plays loud, upbeat, pop music. I don't think it's good for digestion, and definitely not conducive for mealtime discussions, but that's how it always is.",

We were constantly asked by 4 different people how we were doing . 2 by the waiters, 1 by supervisor Kelly and one by a person asking if we needed our grill changed. Customer service was top notch and I ended tipping them 40%.    Supervisor Kelly made us feel very welcomed and made sure we were happy with our orders.  Even though there's a 2 hour limit, they kept coming with the food non stop unlike some other places where you have to wait till the server comes to get more to bbq because they're short handed or busy.

After reading the reviews about the four meat at a time policy our party of 3 wanted to make sure that we were gonna get the most bang for our buck at $25 bucks per person. We thought since it was just a 2 hour limit that we had to rush and put in our meat orders super quick buy let me advise you that if you come with a small party then you really don't have to rush the process. Trust me, in a 2 hour time frame you will be able to order a lot of freakin meat. The highlights of the meal were the brisket, beef bulgogi, spicy chicken, and my brother in law really loved the cow tongue. Salad was really good and so was the rice. These are also unlimited so make sure to take advantage of that. I was pretty disappointed with the following: the dipping sauces, the majority of the sides, the pork belly dishes, and the Korean fried chicken. If I come back in the future it would probably be with a large group of people for more of a fun experience type thing but I don't think that I would return with a small group of people or a date night. With this being said, it was definitely a really fun experience and I'm glad I tried it. And my brother in law found his favorite restaurant so I was happy with that!",

    "text": "A fantastic experience. It is a long wait to get in, for a reason. They bring you fresh, prepared and marinated, high-quality meats of  your choice, ( there are also a few veggie and seafood choices) and you cook them yourself.   You have a little flame grill plate in front of you, and lots of little dishes of appetizers, like kimchi and  Korean potato salad, and various pickles, and salad or rice, to munch on while it cooks.  The food and atmosphere is awesome. It would be great if there were a few more veggie options, or some fruits to grill for a dessert, but I guess it is just not the cuisine.   The Hawaiian marinated options come with a single slice of pineapple, which is a prize worth fighting for, when grilled. ( yes , I shared. No, I really did NOT want to) I would suggested they offer a plate of pineapple rings as an option, or variety of sliced fruits, as that would make an awesome end to a truly epic meal.   I really hope this restaurant, and restaurant style catches on, as the food options are healthy and fresh, and truly fun. But I can only see the two hour plus wait ( Not their fault! Everybody wants to go here!)getting worse, as more people hear about this.I'd like to see lots more locations, and much less wait. Great job!",

    "text": "Very disappointed. I waited nearly two hours for seats and was amazed at how poorly this restaurant was organized and managed. I've been to several Korean Yakinikus and I can honestly say this restaurant is NOT up to par.  First off, the ambience and restaurant setting. It takes nearly an hour and a half to get seats during \"peak hours\". When you are finally jostled in, the first thing you'll realize is how tight and uncomfortable it is. The restaurant is poorly lit, cramped, and you'll often be stuck sitting next to a large party on the center tables. Unfortunately, on all three occasions I've been there, my \"table mates\" were all discourteous, raucous and unpleasant. Now, the entire blame doesn't go to the restaurant, but they are partially to blame because of the poor table layout!   Second off, the food was mediocre at best. My wife and I ordered the kalbi and bulgogi, which are staples in Korean cuisine. The kalbi was overly sweet, like someone accidentally dumped an extra cup of sugar in sweet! The bulgogi was flavorless, as if it weren't seasoned at all! The meat is clearly not fresh and not marinated properly.  Finally, the servicing. The waiters and waitresses are obviously over inundated with work. It took me nearly two minutes to get a waiter's attention and another five before they delivered my beer! There are no ways to call their attention with a button (as is the way in nearly every Yakinikus). The only way you can get their attention is if you wave frantically and call them over. It's embarrassing and inefficient. Terrible service.  The only thing this place has going for it is the pricing. $25 for an all you can eat for two hours isn't a bad deal, but what good is decent pricing if the product and service are poor?  Highly recommend that you avoid this place!",

You get better cuts of chicken from chic-fil-a. Our tab was $70 between two people and could barely eat any of the meats they advertised as they are just covered in fat. The beef brisket comes out sliced as if it was sitting in a freezer. Wow what a rip off. The silver lining was out server was really nice. Oh by the way they charge you if you don't finish your plates so unless you like eating more fat than meat avoid this place",

The service was subpar, evidenced by us flagging down anyone that would give us attention.  We had to beg for cocktails, ask for waters, ask for plates to be brought, then ask for them to be cleared!  The server brought the food and dropped it at the table, walked away without every turning on the grill... ummm?  The servers had absolutely no idea what \"gluten free\" meant.  We had that awkward standoff that ended with me asking if he had a manager or a chef he could ask since all he offered was \"I have no idea what's gluten free\".  Turns out... NOTHING.  Okay not completely True, but all I was offered was unseasoned meats.  They do not offer a single sauce that is GF, none of the marinades are GF.  They couldn't decide if the sides were GF so I chose not to eat them.  After eating 3 or 4 pieces of bland, tasteless meats, I was glad to leave and go eat a real meal.  It was insanely expensive, ESPECIALLY for the minuscule offerings I could enjoy.  I would not go back.",

The servers were very attentive and constantly refilling or asking if we needed more. We went on a feeding frenzy--Galbi, bulgolgi, Hawaiian chicken, gyoza, jap chae, garlic calamari, Korean fried chicken---sometimes seconds on each item. As long as the grill is empty after 2 hours there's no up-charge and each person pays $27.99 each i believe. We were very satisfied with the food. It's a good option if you want to try several Korean dishes for a reasonable price. Come hungry!",

    "text": "I have to start off by saying my friends and I are so excited that a Gen has finally opened in Arizona. We would only go to Gen whenever we were in Vegas or California.   There have been a couple times where I've tried to go to Gen, but the wait was at least 2 hours. With that being said I suggest to go for lunch or an early dinner around 5pm because if you try to go at 7pm most likely the wait will be right before closing.   My friends and I decided on an early dinner and arrived to Gen at 5pm, and we were seated right away. It was just frustrating because we were seated right away but no one came to greet us or asked us for any drinks orders for at least 10 minutes. We kept looking around like is anyone going to help us? When someone finally assisted us, we immediately started putting orders in because I'm not sure if it's like Vegas or Cali with a 2 hour limit. There were multiple times where orders were missing, and drinks were missing, which I understand cause they get busy and side tracked, but it came to a point where we had 2 waitresses assist us.   When it came to paying the bill, we knew from the get go that they can only take up to 3 cards because thats just their policy. For this location that meant they can only split it 3 ways, meaning you can't have 3 cards and the rest of the people pay cash. Which was confusing cause other locations did that no problem by just splitting the check for each individual.   Other than that, the food was amazing per usual. Hands down the best Korean bbq I've ever had, and it's even better that it's all you can eat. I suggest saving your appetite before coming here then go all out and order as much as you can. I recommend the spicy bulgogi, the regular pork bulgogi, Hawaiian pork belly, and the jap chae.",

    "text": "I'm finally glad AZ has stepped up their game and got an amazing AYCE Kbbq place.  They have been in desperate need for one and always fall short of expectations when there's a new kbbq joint. When AZ had their first AYCE at ohya! It was hype, but didn't live up to it due to limited days and hours, plus their food was mediocre. They ran the show for some times and the locals weren't that impressed, but what can you do when they're the only one offering AYCE at the time. Just recently, Gangnam Kbbq opened up and it raised the bar and it temporarily became AZ AYCE Kbbq to go with tier options and better quality food than ohya!  Now the bar has been set even higher and I don't believe any Kbbq AYCE can compete for awhile. The location is at Tempe Market Place which is a great location with high traffic. I've been to many Gens in SoCal and absolutely love the variety of meats along with the service, atmosphere, and quality of food. I was super stoked and have been constantly checking their Facebook to see when they would open and finally it became a reality.  The expectations were met and they delivered it and I couldn't be happier!   My favorite dish was the Crispy Cajun Chicken! It was absolutely flavorful along with their typical bulgogi, galbi, pork belly and so on. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try Kbbq and AYCE. For $25 to stuff your face, you can't really beat that! The service was great and they kept refilling our waters, see if we needed any more meats, changed our grills timely, and made sure we got all of our sides and drinks. Exceptional service, amazing food, and great atmosphere!   The only small gripe is I didn't try the pork cheek, but I'll be sure to get that next time! Hopefully they'll open more and more locations in AZ!",

    "text": "Tonight was a big YIKES in regards to my experience at Gen. At this location, I'm a frequent customer and have enjoyed all of my experiences here. A few of my friends work here so we decided that we wanted to eat KBBQ tonight. While being seated, our server, Amanda helped us with getting started and making sure we had everything we needed. After that, we rarely saw her, and if we did, she never asked if we needed anything else. While waiting and looking around another server, David decided to help us with things we needed. Every time we needed something, David made sure we had it in a FLASH. Not only was David serving us, but other people were helping us. Basically, anyone BUT our server. My friend mentioned to me that our server, Amanda, May have gone on her break. That would have been nice to know considering we were waiting for so long every time we were ready to order more. Our table came to a decision, that we should have David as our server, because he was really SERVING us. It's not fair to us to not be served properly when visiting a restaurant. It also isn't fair for another server to be serving another person's table. If we left gratuity, it would have gone to her. When asked to be switched to David, our original server was mad and let management know. Chip (whatever position he is) came over to let us know that was not allowed and Amanda would still serve us. Still after that, she wasn't doing her job to serve us. This really ticked me off because if you won't allow us to switch servers, at least tell our original server that she needs to step up her game. I feel as though I was given improper treatment just because two out of our party, worked at Gen. If I would have came with people that didn't work at Gen, I would have not been treated this way. I asked to speak to Chip at our table, and when he came, he gave the SNOTTIEST attitude saying that if I didn't like the server, I should have asked in the beginning to change servers. How was I supposed to know that she would have done a bad job? Doesn't make sense. He mentioned that she had gone on a break. If she was going on a break, she should have let us know and there should have been a server assigned to help us while she was out. NOPE, chip didn't care. \"Well she has five other tables\", well other servers have their table as well and seem to be handling their tables perfectly fine. I'm usually very patient, but coming by a table of no more than 5 times is UNACCEPTABLE. The way he spoke to me was so DISRESPECTFUL and I'm not one to start something up. I let what he had to say knowing he was wrong for it. If I had came in with my family or other people, that would not be the way to talk to a customer. If it was \"too late\" to change servers the least he could have done is let the gal know and to serve us better. If I wanted a specific server in the first place, I would have asked. I've enjoyed all my visits at Gen, but today was not a good visit. I'm disappointed in the service as well as how Chip handled this situation. If Chip wants me to come with any concerns I have during future visits, I'll be GLAD to bring it up to his attention.",

I was surprised that this place was really good! At first I thought it was just hype. The meat is really good and you can't really complain on how it's being cooked because you are the one cooking it.   The atmosphere it self is great. It's very inclusive and great for one on ones. I liked that they played bar type of music without serving \"bar food\". Bar food isn't really the greatest. The customer service is also exemplary. I'm not the type of person that needs constant customer service, but I was surprised that the staff was super attentive and always asked if we needed anything. Our server Luna, and the staff members Jason, and Leyna were so great!  Nothing bad to say about this place, except for the wait. That's understandable though..",

The hostess seated us and said it was busy so can sit in a booth. 15 minutes goes by and our server still hasn't greeted us yet.  We had to get another servers attention to find out who our server was. She was nice enough to get our order started since we had to wait. She pointed out our server to us. Not saying any names since this is a new restaurant.'  Finally, we see our server walk by had to get his attention for him to even come by. \"he needs to work on his server skills\"   Every time we asked for something he just dropped it off and left. Couldn't even get a word in.  Two manager came by and asked how our food was. So that's a plus and then the nice server took over for the one that was incompetent.  The food was good, obviously is self serve all you can eat Korean BBQ. It was only $15.99 for lunch. It has almost has the same amount of items for dinner which is $25.99.  Cool atmosphere, blue lights everything and white booths.",

    "text": "Two words - Amazing food! I have had Gen Korean BBQ in California before and I love it so much. I was so happy when I found out they made one location in Arizona. I'm a fan of Korean food so I definitely had to come here.  The atmosphere is great. The interior design inside is beautiful and there are many tables that can seat 6+ which is perfect.  Knowing this place gets extremely busy, my group of friends and I went at 11:30am for the lunch special. There was no wait and we got seated right away by the nice hostess Thuy. I was pretty surprised that there was decent amount of people at 11:30 though because the store opens at 11am. Lunch special is $15.99 for all you can eat based off the 25 items off the lunch menu which is a great deal with lots of variety! You get a 2 hour limit per group which is reasonable.   There's not much to critique about the food because you are the one grilling it yourself. But every time we ordered the meat it always looked presentable and it came out extremely quick too once we ordered. It probably only takes 5 mins to get to us after we ordered. I also ordered Capri Strawberry Soju. It was super tasty! Price was $8.99 which is a little pricy but I think it's worth it because it comes in a big clear pouch and with two cute LED flashing ice cubes.  The customer service was fantastic. Our main server was Vu and he was really nice about explaining the prices about other items such as drinks, keeping track of the order every round, and always checked on our table if we needed anything like water, more rice or if everything in general was okay. He was really patient about everything and was great at communicating. Luna was another server there. She was very nice and friendly. She also made sure everything was okay and gave us a grill change if we needed. When she delivered my Soju drink, she socialized with our group for a little which was great because we enjoyed her presence and made us laugh. I appreciate the other servers too who come around to check if we need a grill change, give us more water, or take empty dishes out.   The only thing I was disappointed about was not being able to get to try the ice cream macaroon sandwich. There was only Vanilla ice cream with taro macaroon left when I really wanted to try the Green Tea. I wasn't sure why it was all sold out when I ordered it at 12:30 and the store opened at 11. Maybe they didn't restock the night before. But regardless it's still a great place and I would come back a million times more!",

    "text": "It's finally open and definitely worth it!   Dinner is $24.95 for adults and less for kids.  You get SOOO many options from beef to pork to chicken to seafood. Although today is their official soft opening, that did not stop them from providing good service. The place was packed full and the wait was out the door.   You really can't go wrong with all you can eat meat at an affordable price. I love that there is plain meat so you can dip it in your sauce and also marinated meat when you just want that extra oomph.   They do however limit you to 4 orders of meat at a time which is fine because once the meat arrives, you can put in your next order.   Pros: + service was perfect !  + never had to ask for drink refills   + grill was promptly change throughout dinner  + that volcano chicken was bomb, we order it 3 times and each time it came out, it felt freshly fried and not just sitting around ( watch out it is a little spicy )   Cons:  - they are cheap on their side dishes, when a customer ask for a refill, it means they actually eat that side so give a lot. Felt like we had to ask for it way to often because they give very little at a time - the person who collect empty plates kept taking away our half eaten salad bowl and not refilling it so we end up having no salad or keep asking for it again   Oh and they currently are not serving alcohol and don't have dessert yet. One of the server assured us they will soon.   Definitely would recommend this place! My favorites are beef brisket, Hawaiian steak, and rib meat!",

We waited about 15 minutes for our table and our server Ly was very nice and efficient. He got our table settle right away and we order 4 plates of meat to start. Their KFC is a must try! All the meats tasted very good, tender, and juicy.   Limit is 4 plates of meat per order but once they arrive you can always start putting in your next order. Our service was the best! Ly was great and fast at getting our side dishes and putting in our order.   Price is 15.99 for lunch before 3pm, after that its 24.95. But for AYCE, the price is worth it.

    "text": "Finally! It took forever for it to be finished up and open for business! I've been waiting for it to open because I love their California locations!   If you've never had all you can eat Korean BBQ before, you'll definitely want to have Gen be the first place you try. If you go for lunch, it's $16 with a large selection of choices, and if you go for dinner, it's $25 with some added dinner items that are delicious. Bugolgi, Hawaiian Pork Belly, and Beef belly are my favorites. The first two are already marinated so you don't need to dip them into any of their sauces. But for the last one you can dip it into any of the three provided options - which are all good. And if you don't know what to order, they have little markers on the menu pointing out which ones are the top choices - but you can't go wrong.   Downsides of Gen: (honestly there's really none) -You can only order 4 items at a time, but it's fine because you can't cook everything at once.  -They can only split the bill at a max of 3 different ways  -2 hours is the max you can stay (but you'll be plenty full by then)  Conclusion: EAT HERE. The first REAL AYCE Korean bbq in Arizona. Nothing compares to it. And do yourself a favor, come with an appetite. I promise you'll get your money's worth.",

Didn't order pork belly and it was brought to us in place of Hawaiian Steak. We decided to cook it and try it - didn't like it - and our server took it away without a problem. Our server - Kelsey - got us everything we asked for and quickly. She wasn't very personable and didn't stop in and check if we needed more drinks or meat/veggie orders. We had to catch her as she was strolling by each and every time. Not once did SHE come and ask US what we needed. EVEN the bill!!  For our first visit - which Kelsey had asked us if we had been there before - was not what I expected. I would have liked our visit to have been treated AS our first visit. Food was good. We left full. We got all that we asked for (plus one thing we didn't). When we ordered more meats they arrived very quickly - delivered by other servers - and just plopped on our table. Just very impersonal - except when we left. After we paid there was a nice have a good day and thanks for coming. Which WAS personable.",

I've been craving a high quality AYCE kbbq since I left LA, and although Gen is a higher price point than I usually care to pay - I live in Arizona, so I'll take what I can get.  Let me also mention that Luna is a FABULOUS waitress. Seriously, she knows what she's doing.  What's cool about this Gen in particular is the menu is actually different from the norcal and socal ones I've been to - namely, they serve korean fried chicken! Seriously impressed. It's SO good. The bulgogi and pork belly are my other favorite things to order.  The meat is high quality and consistent with other Gens. Also, I've only gone for lunch at this Tempe location but the music isn't as blaringly loud as the California Gens - a big pro for me!  GO HERE! Try to go for lunch to make the lunch price on weekdays, if possible - I hate waiting hours for a table, ugh. Also, COME HUNGRY.  Rice is included so eat up.",

He offered a 50% discount which I accepted although I could have pushed for free. The manager was nice and understanding, mind you this was my daughters' bday dinner. Maybe others have and or will have a better experience but I would not recommend. You can find more authentic Korean inspired restaurants at a more cost affective rate.

Gen BBQ is a great place to introduce your friends to Korean barbecue, because there are a lot of familiar items on the menu, such as Hawaiian steak and Cajun chicken, and even an option for simply veggies! But be sure to introduce your friends (and yourself) to the wonders that is bulgogi, which is marinated slices of beef. The sauce is the best.    I came here on Monday for lunch. When we went, it was $16 for lunch, which includes around 20 different items, which is an extremely good deal for All You Can Eat. There is a two hour limit, but that is //plenty// of time to get everything you want.   The servers are extremely friendly, the one that served us had a lot of energy and did jumping jacks in front of us! (It was adorable) You can only get four plates at a time, but the servers come around at just the right time when you're ready to order again.   Overall, a great place, but I was slightly disappointed in the lack of Korean delicacies, such as galbi and bibimbap.I heard they do a rotation of dishes, so maybe I just have to come again!",

It took our waiter a minute to come out, but we did Need some time to turn on our grill. Apparently The vent that sucks the smoke interferes with the Grills starter. But none the less we got our grill going and waited for service. Our server was very nice, very prompt, met all my request. Got all orders out to us in a timely fashion. He did forget some things however it is busy.. as usual, so it's not a big deal that he forgot some things.   The food: my favorite part.  The marinades are Very tasty, bulgogi was very tasty, beef chedol , Hawaiian Steak and chicken of course was Amazing, the Ban Chan refills were Endless. All pork products were amazing.   Prices: Dinner prices on Weekends  Recommendations: Have a little Saucer with Oil and A brush to Brush a Little on the grills to minimize Having to switch them out so much and Also Prevents food from sticking to much.   Love this place. Until Next time.   Four stars given cause we had some grill oning issues ( waiter or Hostess should be turning them on )",

They have a texting system, so you only have to be 10 minutes away when they do text you.  Nice atmosphere. They have a huge screen playing the movie Hook. They also have club music while you are eating.   The waiters and waitresses are pretty nice and they're pretty attentive to your needs. You should only ask your waiters for specific stuff, such as ordering the four plates of whatever is on the menu. There is a lunch and there is a dinner menu, which differs by 5 plates. So a meat like, galbi, is only on the dinner menu. Need dinner price for per person was about $25 before tax.  Food : The slices of meat were pretty good. Some other meats have been free slice and Frozen. But the quality overall was good. The marinated meets like the bulgogi and galbi were the right taste and not too strong.  You also get the generic side dishes and salad. Rice is included. And they have a drink menu.  The plate changing for the barbecue grill was pretty fast.   Overall, a good experience minus the wait time.  Check it out.",

    "text": "We heard about this place and decided to try it as part of my 'Birthday Dinner' celebration.  The overall experience at the restaurant was good and the quality of the food was excellent.  We had two negative experiences during the visit (and one after)...Availability of servers to order more meat and the number of burners/table size provided to a party of 7.    We had to hunt down and flag multiple different servers to order another set of proteins (as they provide you with a limit of 4 protein options and cannot order more until the first has arrived).  With providing a 2 hour limit per table, they either need more servers available to take protein orders or have a way the table can order themselves.  The proteins were going as fast as they were cooked because we had a large party and only 1 burner to cook it on, which leads into the next negative item.  As a party of 7, we felt that they crammed us into one table with one burner to share across all 7 people.  We're not small people, so fitting 7 people around a table normally used for 4 was a little bit of a tight fit.  Add to that, we only had 1 burner to share across us all.  I would've thought they would have tables to accommodate larger groups that would allot for 1 burner for up to 4 people in the party, but they did not.  My son-in-law left his hat at the table (as he took it off and placed it on his knee while eating) and we called for 15 minutes and, when we finally go through, they told us they were too busy to look at the table we were seated for the hat and told us we would have to call back the next day and see if anyone turned it in (my wife was going to call today, but they aren't open as of the time of this posting).  So, to sum up, here's my overall rating for each category:  Overall Experience - 4 Food Quality - 5 Service Quality - 3 Large-party accommodations - 3",

I was on board and decided to join. Upon arriving the business looked nice and the ambiance was nice. We didn't wait long to be seated in a booth at the front of the restaurant. We sat and ordered drinks with our server, which I asked for water with lemon.. as she's gone we realize the first issue.. the a/c is blasting over our heads.. so we all froze the entire dinner, and the heat from the grill on the table was obsolete in helping warm us up. Upon arrival with our drinks there was no lemon in my water so I asked for lemon again... she took our order and returned yet again with no lemon. Long story short I asked for lemon 3 times before she came back and realized yet again she didn't grab the lemons and asked a passing bus boy to grab them. My friend also asked for rice 3 times before getting irritated and demanding the rice. One of the food runners brought us dumplings and dropped them on the floor and told us she would be right back with more... she never came back with more. Our server also never once offered to change out our grill. It was honestly awful and I'll never return to a Gen after that. At least not this location!!!!",

Make sure you DO NOT waste your food. They charge per plate for unfinished food. You may not take food to go, so order only what you can finish. You have two hours to devour all the yummy foods!

As far as the food is concerned, I'll rate that at 5 stars. The service itself was terrible though. We actually had to grab another waiter other than our own to assist us with the grill because ours neglected us for the majority of our time until the bill was delivered.",

The server was nice and funny, so we ordered things according to her recommendations. Our grill was changed a few times without asking for it, so it was great. The meat was fresh and delicious. I have never ate so much meat before They had also great Asian beer. I would recommend this place to big groups and even a date. We will be coming again.",

    "text": "Korean bbq may not be an inexpensive cuisine and for that reason, those of us who love Asian food but try to watch our budgets carefully will tend to gravitate more toward Chinese or Vietnamese. But a bit of a splurge is a good thing every now and then, and this place fits the bill. This was the International Supper Club UYE's pick for November and it was quite a satisfying experience. We came on a weekday evening and it did not take long for us to be seated. Our very friendly server explained the method of ordering, set up our table's grill and within minutes we were were ordering and grilling a variety of items: bulgogi (so good, we ordered it several times), galbi, a number of beef, chicken, and pork preparations in a variety of marinades, plus some cooked items such as glass noodles - all very good. The servers were very efficient and the items were brought to our table very shortly after we ordered them. The restaurant is conveniently located within the Tempe Marketplace. While 25 bucks per person may not make this a place for most people to frequently visit, the quality and quantity of food, the modern casual vibe and the friendliness and efficiency of the staff definitely makes this a great place for treating yourself to a Korean feast once in a while.",

We asked questions and felt like we were idiots. That was not a good start. I tried to order water but the waiter did not seem to understand what I want, my partner had to ask for me. Yes, I do have an accent since I am not a native speaker but having to ask five times was way too many times! Again, got looks and felt like an idiot. Food was okay, nothing great and they charge you if you don't finish the plate, but at least have the decency to let you know in advance. We also waived at other waiters to change the cooking plates but were ignored so I guess it was not just our waiter. Way overpriced given the quality of the food and the quality of the service. Very disappointing, I will never go back there.",

    "text": "We got here on a Saturday night at around 4:45pm and the restaurant was already packed, but we were able to be seated in about 5 minutes (party of 7, split into 2 adjacent tables).  The interior definitely has a modern semi-club feel to it, and the restaurant itself is really cavernous and spread out.    The food was just okay, with some pretty good items on the menu, along with other things that aren't worthy of being ordered.  The brisket (chadol) was fatty but not overly greasy and probably the best thing on the menu.  The spicy baby octopus, pork jowl, and the vegetables round out the top four.  All of the other beef items sort of tasted the same (beef tongue, rib meat, beef belly, hangar steak, etc.).  They also have the real dipping/accompaniment sauces that are not given out but that you have to ask for, including garlic/pepper slices that you can add to the grill.  The biggest issue with the system was the quantity of food that is brought with each order.  They allow 4 items total with each order per table (meat, side, soup, whatever), with each item entailing a pretty small amount of food.  If we had known how long it would take to flag down a server to put in another order of food, receive said food, and then reorder more food, we would have just immediately ordered 4 new plates as soon as the previous order arrived (which is what we ended up doing once we realized how to speed things up).  Two hours can go by pretty quick when you're spending a lot of time just waiting for food to arrive or to request more plates.    Another issue was the charging of adult prices to 7 year-old boys just because both of their heights barely exceeded the 50-inch mark of the ruler at the hostess station - in their eyes, once you reach the arbitrary height of 4 feet and 2 inches, your appetite is equivalent to that of a full-grown adult.   So all you families with young kids who are preparing to eat here, get ready to pay adult prices if your children are taller than 4'2\".    The meat quality is what you would expect from an AYCE restaurant, which means that it's borderline passable.  So even though the food was subpar and the service kind of slow, we had fun while were there, and I'm just glad that more of these types of restaurants are finding their way to the Phoenix area.",

I'm never one to complain as I understand waiters can be busy but unfortunately, the manager didn't even help solve anything.

Please allow us to blow this freezing air on you now. Alright, let's have some GEN. After placing our order we finally got the calamari after 15 minutes but had to spit it out it was so bad. The food runner that brought our vegetables should have just carried them in his hand, oh wait, that's exactly what he did. Palmed the top of the vegetables as he's setting it down. With the table ticket in the same hand! Why don't you just go ahead and sneeze on it in front of us?? After 30 minutes the meat never came. Told the waitress that we just wanted the bill. Charged us for the entire thing. $53 for 2 ppl and just waters.  Asked for a manager, they sent the hostess over that sat us. She asked, \"Is something wrong?\" Goodness gracious. She went to get a manager. We walked out after no one came. Pathetic. The manager should be fired and that entire staff needs to be retrained. I used to love GEN but never again after that.

I still never received my soy sauce from him. He never came to change out our grill so we could make our other food. We had to ask one of the busboys to change it out which he did with no problem. Finally when our server did come to the table we expressed why we were upset telling him all our rice and all the other food was now cold while waiting for sauce. He tells me no the rice isn't cold it still feels hot to him. I work in the customer service industry myself and this service was completely unacceptable.

    "text": "Quality of food is decent. The attitude given by the hostess who seated us pissed my friend and I off completely. My friend and I walked in your restaurant each holding a milk tea we got while walking around the shopping mall under the 40 degree heat yesterday. Both of the drinks were 2/3 finished already as we walked in, and since we never had problems taking in personal drinks into any other restaurants, we simply didn't think of that there would be an issue with it. We walked in and were directed to our seats by a hostess with long hair and of Asian decent. After we were seated, suddenly the hostess yelled out, \"Umm we don't allow outside drinks...\" Well no one said anything as we walked in or as we walked all the way to our table toward the back of the restaurant. So not wanting to throw away our drinks as my friend and I just don't like to waste food, or walk back to our car under the horrible heat, I responded, \"This is our first time here, I'm sorry and I promise we won't do it again next time.\" The hostess, instead of giving some suggestions on how to deal with these drinks, rolled her eyes and made bitchy faces at my friend and I, and repeated, \" No we don't allow outside drinks.\" Meanwhile another waitress, who actually served our table, walked by and said to us that it is fine since we took seat already, just make sure to not do it next time. My friend and I nodded quickly and said thank you to the waitress a couple of times. You think this is over? Of course not!! So I looked over my shoulder, wanting to thank the hostess as well, thinking that she would agree to let us keep the drinks, but I saw her rolling her eyes again and walked away. A minute later a manger looking lady came over and insisted that they don't allow outside drinks. But she was very polite and kind and said we could keep our drinks at the front desk so they didn't have to be thrown away. I am not complaining the fact that they didn't allow outside drinks because my family owns a restaurant and they restrict outside alcoholic beverages. Although my friend and I had non-alcoholic milk tea drinks, I understand that each restaurant has its own rules and standards. But the whole communicating experience with the front desk hostess was just disgusting and she is perhaps one of the rudest hostess i've ever encountered. Maybe it is because she didn't get enough education on how to communicate properly with others, especially the group of people who help pay for her job!!! For the past fifteen years I've been in Phoenix, It is not uncommon for me to bringing my own bottled water or drinks into restaurant when I dine out. I have a very sensitive stomach and will get very bad stomach aches if I drank tap water, or drinks that are too cold. So I normally just take my own water or drinks as it has the perfect temperature and won't upset my stomach. And I have literally NEVER had a problem at any of the other restaurants, EVER!! Again, I respect that every restaurant has its own rules, and while I'm not going to argue if it is proper for customers to bringing half finished drinks that they did not want to throw away, I just want to say, one bad and rude hostess can really ruin someone's mood and dining experience. For the fact that even after another waitress said it was fine for my friend to keep our drinks, that hostess still turned around and reported us to the manager just so my friend and I couldn't keep our drinks. Really??? I just really hope that in the future, make sure to select well-rounded servers who received enough education and trainings to properly communicating with customers instead of rolling eyes and making  faces! Thank you!",

    "text": "I've waited a long time for Gen to come to Phoenix. I've been to most of the locations in Cali. All the cali locations were very good, especially the Cerritos location. The servers there are amazing.   The Tempe location needs better training. We had Donna as our server. She was horrible. She didn't light our grill so we had to flag down another server to light it. The meat came out before the grill was lit. Everything else took forever and she kept forgetting items we asked for. We had to ask for items 3 or 4 times or ask other servers walking by. We put in meat orders and they kept getting lost. We sat for at least 10 minutes without meat. We also ordered pork belly 2 times and never got it. Only when we requested it a third time did she finally bring it. She asked if we had ordered it from someone else and she made the excuse that she had 8 tables to serve. That's not my problem. Talk to your manager if you can't handle all your tables. We originally had a party of 10 but they couldn't seat us together so they split us into two tables. There were five per table but still charged 18 percent tip. 18 percent starts at 6 people.   The food and meat quality is very good but I wish they had large intestine. I will definitely come back but if I get Donna as my server again, I'm walking out. 5 stars for food. 1 star for service.",

    "text": "My friend and I went here on Sunday 11/05 and had a horrible experience! We had never been to Korean BBQ and thought it would be fun. From the beginning to the end, it was a terrible experience!   When we walked in we were informed it would be about a 20 minute wait so we asked if we could head to the bar, which we did. We had a difficult time choosing a drink because they were out of everything we wanted! They didn't have Kirin and the only local beer was Four Peaks Kiltlifter. We asked for their featured drink (something Martinez) and the bartender informed us they have never been able to make it and he didn't know why it was on the menu. The condition of the bar was atrocious as well. Boxes of beer stacked in plain view in the bar, most of them damaged because of a wet floor. Dirty glasses and coffee cups on the bar. AND the liquours all had saran wrap around the spouts, implying they have an issue with fruit flies. We decided to continue with the lunch because we know they are new and we wanted to try it and give them the benefit of the doubt.  After about five minutes, we received a text notification that the table was ready. We grab our drinks and walk to the front, where the hostess politely informs us the table isn't actually ready. So we walk back to the bar, drinks still in our hands and sit down again. The hostess is there almost instantly to say our table is ready. A lot of back and forth for nothing; they need to get organized!  We sit down and tell our waitress (when she asks) it's our first time. We were informed we had to order the dinner menu (at dinner price) and that any left over food would constitute an additional $5/plate upcharge!!!! She also told us we could only order 4 items at a time. All of this information is important, but we still didn't know how to eat a Korean BBQ and we received NO instruction! We asked a couple other people who worked there, and they all seemed clueless and unable to provide instruction. The food was amazing. The marinades and meats were amazing; if you love meat, you need to try Korean BBQ (just not here!) No one explained the sides or how to compliment the meats with them, so we felt like we missed out on the full experience. We also received no instruction on how long to cook the meats or seafood which seemed odd.  Lastly, the worst experience of them all came when we paid. For two of us, it was a $75 tab. My friend put down half in cash, I was paying the other half on my card. Suddenly, my card was charged $190!!!!!! After finally flagging someone down after a good 5 minutes to say I wanted to talk to someone about the charge, the waitress comes over to confirm that my card was mischarged, the manager was fixing it and that she would be by in a minute. She still did not come by after several minutes so I went to her at the front cash register. She had several receipts and it was very obvious there was confusion on how to fix the error. She did not speak to me at all, she let her hostess at her side do the talking. The hostess said they had credited my card $190-$38 which was approximately $152 and then they handed me $38 cash and were about to swipe my card for the entire tab of $75!!!! At this point, I said no way and took my card back and said they shouldn't have handed me the $38 cash and that it was theirs to cover my bill. Now, they said I owed them an additional $3 (I'm not sure how and I should have asked at the time) but I was so unwilling to hand my card back, that my friend dug in her purse for the money. At this point, I was frank with them and said that I thought it was BS that they charged my card incorrectly, did a poor job fixing it and then were being petty over the $3!!!!! She didn't apologize, she didn't say I was right, she didn't backtrack on the request. Her manager never looked at me or spoke to me or apologized. No one tried to fix this!!!!!! We walked away very upset.  I called my bank yesterday when I didn't see any changes in the charge. My bank confirmed that at the very least, they should see some activity on their end of a debit/credit and there was none so I had to dispute the charge to make sure I get my money back.  If you decide to go, you'll have a wonderful meal but hopefully you'll know how to cook it and get the full benefit of the meal and cooking. Take cash!!!!!!!!!!!",

After listening to 30 mins of rules we were finally able to order.  Final rule is that you only have a 2 limit.  Not a problem because I don't think it takes me 2 hrs to eat.  If you like pork then for sure try this.  I don't eat pork for the most part. I probably should've done my homework and realized steak isn't on the menu and the options for chicken were very limited.  Each time we submitted another order they got slower n slower to bring it to us.  If your emphasized rule is we only have a 2 hr rule then you should be prompt as well.  We only spent 45 mins there.  Had maybe 3 courses.  Our waitress left after 30 mins and her replacement took 10 mins to come over and check in on us.  I only had chicken and brisket which both were very bland. Spicy chicken: a slice of non-marinated chicken breast with a side of nacho cheese .  I have no idea how this is spicy chicken. Volcano chicken: already cooked breaded chicken tenders tossed in hot/sweet sauce.   Truly don't think I'll be coming back here.  It's just not worth the price.  If you like hype instead of good satisfying food then this is ur spot.",

Our first server was rude and I told him that I've been to this restaurant back home in California but he made it sound like they were totally different, which confused me. Then the first server had to clock out, our second server came and took our second order and then the food took too long that we told two other servers we were just waiting on the food then they brought us the food, then after receiving that food, they brought our same order but there was a confusion, they ordered our food twice which we didn't do at all and then they messed up our order. Then our fourth server came and he was nice, he kept on checking up on us to see if our food was ready, besides everyone else, then we were finished with our food and then there was another server that came and we told him that we were ready for our check. We paid with cash and card between three people, and we told the waiter that the cash is for the two people and the rest is on the card, our waiter asked if we wanted change and we said no. They bring us back the check and they charged my friend more on her card and thought we were splitting the cost which we already explained to him. Then we talk to the manager, she heard our complaint, but did not do anything to appeal to our problem, she did not offer any discount for the terrible service we received that night, she just told us sorry and also she hopes to see us again.",

After hearing that several times every 15 minutes it gets a little noisy, but that's the only downside to this place! The food is great! If you've never grilled on your own before, this will be a fun learning experience! They have all kinds of meat marinated in different sauces so they're all a different taste. The Red Wine Pork Belly is my all time favorite, but I recommend picking one of each meat to try at first before deciding which ones you'd like to try different marinades of. There are also side dishes that are delicious and more can be brought out upon request, but be careful, they want you to fill up with the side dishes and the drinks so that you eat less meat! You want to get your money's worth so keep the side dish eating and soda drinking to a minimum!!! Overall, lunch is a lot cheaper than dinner and you still get a great meat selection, give this place a try if you're a meat lover like me and you won't be disappointed!!",

The place was so cool looking, modern, with blue decorated lights. The place was super crowded since today was their soft opening. Even though it was busy, our waitress Ejin was very nice and tentative. She made sure we are well taken care of. The servers came frequently to check on us and to replace or grill for fresh ones. The place was very nice, clean and really taken care of.   It's an all you can eat restaurant and you pay a base price of $24.99 per person, but drinks are sold separately. Many of the soft drinks are refillable. I do recommend trying the yogurt sodas so refreshing! You get to order 4 plates time, they do this so orders are paced which makes less waste. This is a great way for not wasting food. I do recommend the spicy baby octopus and the Gen premium sliced steak! The beef was tender and delicious. They have unlimited small dishes like kimchi pickled onions etc.... and salad to go along with all the meat as well. There are 37 items from the dinner menu to choose from for your protein choices. I also ordered this clear noodle dish called Japchae which tasted so good, with veggies and sauce.   Even though I live way out on the West Side, for sure I'll be back here quite often!!:) so if any of you enjoy Korean BBQ like I do, I recommend giving this place a try. You won't regret it!!",

The wait time was expected, it was about a 1-2 hours wait. Note to people who have never been to a AYCE KBBQ, wait time of 1-2 is expected. Pretty busy for a soft opening but regardless, the service was superb.   We got a huge list of food, everything on there was beautifully marinated and delicious. Refer to picture :) is",

From the moment we walked in you needed a fly swatter to keep the flys off of you. The wait was not bad for a Sunday at 4pm. As they walked us to our table you could sense mad chaos within the staff. After getting seated I needed to wash my hands from sitting with all of the flys and swatting them for 15 mins. The bathrooms are near the kitchen and the smell and the grime on the floor were absolutely horrible. I finally got back to my family at the table and was greeted by our server. The server seemed like we were upsetting her by dining at the restaurant. She had the worse attitude and made the experience that much worse. We rode it out and tried to enjoy the experience. We ordered some cocktails which took over 15 mins to get and I had to inform the waitress that our drink was sitting at the bar. I ordered a rum and coke and received a full glass of coke and my rum separately in a small glass and was charged for something completely different. We talked to another server and he explained to us that they have extreme turnover with waitresses.  I could go on and on with this horrible experience that I wasted over $240 on. Won't go again!",

I'm always surprised at how quick and prompt the service is here. Most other Korean BBQ places will start to ignore you after the first few plates, forget to bring plates you ordered, etc., but the staff at Gen always seems to come around at the right time asking what you want for your next order and changing your grill constantly. The ventilation is also a lot better than most other places which is good for how big the place is. Quality of the meat has always been good. The portions are on the smaller side but I actually prefer that because I don't end up ordering a final plate that has way too much for me to finish - plus, as mentioned before, the staff is always coming around, so I'm never left with much downtime between plates.",

They do not take reservations, you have to actually come in and write your name down and wait. So my friends told me to get there 2 hours early, but when I arrived they said there is no wait time. So I asked if I can be called back 2 hours later, they said no. THEN when my party arrived they told us the wait time is 45 min. WHY ARE THERE NO RESERVATION?! It is very stressful and inconvenient.  Don't get me wrong the food is great. And the service is average.  The staff here are all lazy though! Our grill went black 3 times. The staff would glance at our table and ignore the fact that our grill is dirty.",

The estimated wait time was 2 hours and we prepared our stomach's for this, so it was alright. We had barely been through our second order when they attempted to bring us the bill -- 30 #$^@ing minutes in. We are aware of the 2 hour rule and the 4 limit per order!   The front desk even tried to tell our waiter that we requested the bill when we did not. Uhm no.   After the 3rd order, they actually just dropped the bill on our table even when we were still actively grilling our food. You really wanted us to leave so soon?! We were only ordering brisket and spicy octopus :'(.   The food is great considering there is not much competition in the whole city as the Phoenix metropolitan area is still practically new to the world of KBBQ. The service here leaves much to be desired.  Come at your own discretion. I'll come back... maybe. One day Manna BBQ will start serving spicy octopus and I wouldn't have to deal with this!   Tldr; It's bad service because I felt rushed and I left hungry.",

I'd skip the beef tongue, nothing real special about it. I've had better in a taco. Sides are okay but really who's coming for the vegetables? Things to know before you go: - There's probably going to be at least a one to two hour wait after 5pm Fri-Sun. - Children taller than 40 inches will be charged as a $25 adult during dinner hours. Under 40 inches are $10. - Stated on the menu you can only dine in for no more than 2 hours.  ....If you're offered rice at the beginning of your meal just say no! It's all about the meat, baby!",

    "text": "With the addition on Gen, I find myself missing CA less and less. I used to go to Gen in CA pretty often, so I was STOKED when I heard one was opening in AZ. Congrats AZ you making it in life   Okay so this is your typical AYCE (All You Can Eat) KBBQ spots. We came for lunch which was $15.99, a pretty solid deal and selection of meats. Dinner is I believe 24.99 with more variety.   If you don't know what to get or you're pretty new to the whole KBBQ experience, here are some tips.   Chadol - the brisket, the OG of all KBBQ meats. It's really hard to go wrong. It's thinly sliced perfection of a marbled steak.   Steak - not bad here, pretty basic. Nice fat cap on the top.   Hawaiian Steak - basically anything marinated here is not bad. Make sure you cook it like last in your batch. That way you can keep your grill from charring up too quickly.   Pork Cheek - (Pork Jowl) this is like bliss in a bite. It's even chewier than pork belly. It takes a bit of time to cook but trust me, it's soooo worth it. TRY IT!!!  Smoked pork belly - it tastes like ham. Yea... not my favorite. :/  Octopus - worth the try if you like seafood. Put it all in the middle and grill for a little bit. Let the water from the sauce steam the octopus for a bit. Then cut it in half from head down. And cook on the side. Open and flatten the head even better results.  What you end up with, perfectly cooked octopus. But a super dirty grill. Cook this last.   Get the tofu soup, and try the side dishes (eat it with the meat to give your meal another dimension of complex flavors)   But YEAH! Come on down here, AZ has finally been graced with the presence of amazing KBBQ.",

We ordered Cajun Shrimp, Chicken w/ Cheese Fondue, Thinly Sliced Beef Brisket, Top Sirloin Steak, Soft Tofu Stew, and Veggies.   The quality of the meats were amazing, especially the beef brisket and the top sirloin steak. It literally melts in your mouth. It was very juicy and tender. The seasoning of the shrimp was done very well. It had the perfect flavor. Chicken was pretty good too. As for the soft tofu stew and the veggies, it was a major disappointment. The stew was very bland. No flavor to it whatsoever. I also expected more from the veggie platter. It only had sliced mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers. I was expecting red leaf lettuce, sesame leaves, etc.   The service was too much. Our waiter kept coming over asking us if we wanted more meat; he was being a little nuisance, acting like a salesman. Ugh.   Overall, I recommend this restaurant and will go again for the food.",

We had ordered beef tongue, galbi, pork belly, intestines, chadol, vegetables, korean fried chicken, amd steak. Total 5 rounds of food! We had also ordered tofu stew, japche, and salad. Our waiter was the best waiter I have ever recieved service from - he was extremely friendly, talkative, and made great jokes with us. He was probably the highlight of our visit. His name was Bueller. He was very knowledgeable about the menu items. We had many questions since we were all wanting to try new things. Bueller often checked on us and provided us with an abundance of sauces and side dishes. We were never without food! We enjoyed being companied by Bueller so much we had to even get a picture of him for our Yelp review. If I was a restaurant owner or manager, I would be happy to have a team member who possess the skills and talents Bueller has.",

There are over 20 items you can choose from and you can even select half portions which is great when you are eating in a small group. The quality of the meats was definitely above avg for AYCE standards and the service was great. They put your menu items on an iPad which makes it easy.  However, the WAIT can be brutal! We went on a Sunday night thinking there wouldn't be anywhere there and boy were we wrong. The wait was 1.5 hours. On a Sunday night at 7pm! I can't imagine Fri or Sat night. You probably would need to start eating around 5pm.   Overall, given Korean BBQ in Tempe, this is a great spot. Would definitely go back!",

    "text": "I had heard about this place when it first opened and was curious to try it out when I was back in Arizona. Over the next few months, I saw a lot of my friends singing its praises on Facebook. So before I came back to Arizona, I made a list of all the restaurants I wanted to go to and this was at the top of that list! I had never been to a Korean bbq restaurant before, but this experience was pretty much what I expected. I went with a group of people - some had gone to kbbq before, others hadn't. We went during the holidays on Friday at lunch time. We didn't have to wait at all and it looked like there were still some open tables. However, by the end of our meal, there were a few groups waiting for tables. So I would recommend going earlier for lunch especially since I heard it gets very busy for dinner.  We let the people who had gone to kbbq before be in charge of the grill. The grill is in the middle and you order a few meats at a time and then just place them on the grill using tongs. It's a pretty straightforward process, you just have to make sure the meat is cooked but not overcooked, and be mindful of contamination between cooked and raw meat on the grill. I would recommend having a grill for every 3-4 people. For some reason we had 2 people at 1 grill and 4 people at the other grill and the 2 people at a grill had trouble eating all the food before the next round came out.  Along with the orders of meat, you also get side dishes (banchan) and a bowl of rice, which I think are good to break up all the meat. Other than pork, beef, and chicken, you can also order seafood (octopus, calamari, etc) and vegetables (pineapple, assorted veggies).  Our server was great - he was always checking up on us and put in multiple orders for us cause we wanted to try everything! We also had to get our grill replaced twice because it got burnt - to prevent that from happening, just  make sure to not leave the food on the grill for too long, once it's ready, just set it aside.  By the end, we were all really full and had a great experience overall. My favorites were the bulgogi, spicy chicken, and pineapple. I would definitely come back again and I'd recommend coming with a group of people so you can try more. For the amount you can eat and all the options you can order, this is a great deal!",

(One complaint I do have is, the quality of some meats and chicken is a little cheap and doesn't taste right even when cooked thoroughly.) Beer menu is limited but they have tons of great soju and liquor options.   Introduced Korean barbecue to a couple friends and they absolutely loved it! They enjoyed the interaction between the server and cooking your own food. Service was top-notch, thanks to Derric! He made the entire experience perfect. He explained the ordering-and-cooking process to my pals and he was very attentive to our table. He stopped by often to get refills, take orders and clear plates from the table. He had a full section yet he still stopped by to crack jokes and got to know my group of friends.   Great service, good food and cheap drinks! Going to come back whenever I feel like having a fun dinner with friends.",

Seems like we will order something and the servers didn't really know what it is or can't hear the item. So they have to come back and put the order in again.

Also, your experience is determined based on the waiter you get. Our waitress tonight did not come around often, so it took a longer time to enjoy our food in comparison to our last waiter who was prompt w every order. Additionally, the rim of our grill was dirty and when we inquired about the dirty rim, the waitress said, \"that's normal here\"... that's pretty gross that the previous customer's sauce and raw meat is sitting for an unknown amount of time in such close proximity with where we should be cooking our food. Bigger pieces of our food inevitably touch the edges of the grill. I took a photo of the grill. If you are a germaphobe, I would not eat here.",

I am still pretty salty about this, but I did connect with a very attractive server there, so I guess that helps make up for it.   Okay, on to the meats.   I have been to most of the KBBQ places around the valley, and I think the quality of meat at Gen beats all of the competition. My friend and I ordered the following:  -KFC (Korean Fried Chicken for those who are not blessed enough to know what the True meaning of KFC is) - x2 -Garlic Calamari - x2 (SOOOOO good) -Chadol -Bulgogi -Hawaiian pork belly - x2 -Beef tongue -Extra large bowl of the potato salad (can't do KBBQ without going hard on the potato salad)  Everything was INCREDIBLE, particularly the items we got 2 orders of. They were juicy. They were flavorful. They were nothing short of impressive.   And the best part is that 2 medium-sized Asian girls got to feast on enough food for a small army for only $25 each. I love the beautiful gluttony of AYCE, and Gen KBBQ House is definitely top of the list for places to do it.   Side note: they also have alcoholic \"capri suns\" that light up, which I am eager to try when I am not with someone having an anxiety attack over an irrational fear that the restaurant turns into a club at night.

We usually go for dinner but recently we were able to make it for lunch.

The food here is quite tasty but the service has declined since they opened. When they first opened, all the servers were on top of everything. The past few times I have been, the servers have forgotten to turn the grill on even after our table received the first few plates of food. They also used to tell you what the food was when they brought it (as a lot of it just looks like indiscernible red/pink meat), but that has fallen off a lot lately (luckily we already know what we like, but I can see first-timers never knowing what they like or don't like because they could not tell what it was they were eating). Also, one of the times we came we had a very rude waiter. The way she talked was very unprofessional and she had an attitude with every request, none of which were unreasonable. She even walked to our table and stood there without saying anything before brashly saying \"Can you just take it off the tray?\" before walking away. Why am I tipping if you're not going to serve me? (Tipped anyway, but in hindsight maybe I shouldn't have so she would have known we weren't happy). This has dropped from my top KBBQ place to my \"I'll go if I'm close\" BBQ place.   P.S. The spicy pork belly and Korean fried chicken are amazing, but you can't really go wrong with anything.",

If guests are expected to cook their own food at the table, it would be nice to have cooking times listed somewhere so you don't have to google how to cook your food.  2. Not only are you expected to cook your own food, but if you get the shrimp you apparently are also expected to peel it yourself.  3. If you are vegetarian, don't get the tofu soup. For some reason it has pork in it. Oh, but they don't tell you that on the menu. Never once have I gone to a restaurant and ordered tofu only to find that it is not vegetarian. And there are NO options for vegetarian tofu dishes.",

    "text": "While I was at Gen I took the opportunity to try the all-you-eat Koren BBQ. To sum it up, it was awesome!  I would definitely recommend Gen to family and friends!  The first thing you notice when you walk in in is how the the restaurant looks. And it looks legit. It's a very cool place to eat.  I also took note that the Korean BBQ prices were right in line with what I would expect them to be. What I wasn't expecting, which was a very pleasant surprise, was the amount of meat entrees that were available. There is always a ton of things I want to try but I usually am not adventurous enough to risk paying for an entree that I have absolutely no idea if I'll like. However, with the all you can eat option it's no big deal. They even accommodate a smaller portion if you're unsure which makes me feel better about not having to throw out the dish if it wasn't quite what I was expecting.  Some things I really liked were the beef brisket, smoked garlic pork belly and their KFC chicken was good as well. I also tried beef tongue and Gobchang (beef intestine). I honestly didn't think I would like either, but they were both quite tasty.  While we were there our server took excellent care of us as well. It was fairly busy and yet it seemed like every time I turned around our server was right there. A really great experience for sure.  I will definitely be returning to  try some more, hopefully soon!",

The price for all you can eat bbq is definitely 100% WORTH IT.   My go-to are the beef belly, pork belly, galbi, beef bulgogi and beef tongue. The quality of their meat is of course trumped by more expensive korean bbq spots in California but it's still pretty great quality for the price. I love their side dishes and their dipping sauce. The atmosphere here is upbeat and fun, and is great for big parties or dates. The servers are always attentive and my experience here has always been top notch.",

    "text": "I'm not sure where to begin with my review as this place lived up to the hype for us. We've tried for dinner a few times but the wait was always 90+ mins and when you got 2 kids, that's doesn't work. I've done Korean BBQ while traveling abroad (along with Steamboat, but that's for another restaurant review) and the key thing was the freshness of the food. This place hit the mark on all items. After a few failed dinner attempts we realized going during early afternoon would be best. We dropped in around 1:30pm on a Sat (so you're paying the dinner price because it's the weekend). If you got kids, they will measure by height to determine if they pay the kids price or the adult price. Got lucky as my daughter was just under for only $9.99 but son being a bit taller rang up the $24.99 adult price.   All good... On the fine print it says you have 2 hours but I don't think they really hold you to that, but make sure you pace yourself and look around at the other tables to see what may interest you... We started off with 4 items (and they come out quick) to let the kids do some cooking and add some spices... Started with the Premium Steak, Signature Galbi (grilled ribs), Beef Bulgogi (marinated thin sliced beef) & Cajun Shrimp.... After that we moved on and ordered more Beef Bulgogi and the jumped around trying things like the Hangjungsal (pork), Chadol Baegi (Brisket), flat iron steak, Hawaiian pork belly... All were on point and we didn't stop picking items ranging from the beef tongue to the garlic calamari.   They have a few items they don't require the grill like the K.F.C (Korean Fried Chicken) and Gyoza's...   The only item we weren't snatching up to eat quickly was the Hawaiian styled steak and pork belly. It was boring compared to all the other items but still good, just not much flavor to it.   At the end, I pushed through and ordered the garlic calamari... I was stretching myself to my limits so asked for just a half order... after cooking it, we ordered 2 more as everyone go their 2nd wind as the calamari was on point!!! Definitely looking forward to my next trip here!",

    "text": "This place is amazing! This is my second time here and I enjoyed both times. The first time I came for lunch which is $16.99 per person and there's a few items that you don't get on the lunch menu that is on the dinner menu. This time I came for dinner which is $24.99 per person for all you can eat meat. It's seriously so worth. I think the price is great!  We tried so many different meats (gen steak, calamari, shrimp, pork chop, spicy and Cajun pork belly, KFC chicken, volcano chicken, garlic chicken, thin sliced beef, etc). We tried at least 12-14 meats but I can't remember them all. WARNING : the volcano chicken is HOTTTTT! Way too hot for me to handle but really good and the KFC chicken is a must! Both of these items come out cooked so I recommend getting these first and then once you get them order is raw meat to start cooking. Raw chicken takes the longest to cook so it's usually the last thing we order. The Cajun pork belly and the gen steak were soooooo delicious. The meat has so much flavor it's so good.  When I came for lunch during the week there was no wait but for dinner they quoted us 75-90 min wait and we only waited an hour. It's so worth the wait! Especially if you're coming from the west side like us. The service is good and the employees are always so nice.  If you leave a lot of food left over they will charge you $5. I personally have left a few pieces of chicken and haven't been charged. I think it has to be a lot left over, so only order what you know you're gonna eat.",

She checked in on us frequently but I felt as if we were an inconvenience to her. She did not explain what were on the plates ... we figured it out after trying....it was stuff to season the meats with but we had NO clue and were left to our own devices. We were not given any times for which the meat should cook and in fact had to turn up our own burner as we would have been at Gen for an ungodly amount of time if it were kept at its low level.  The amount of meat given was too much for 2 adults and a child. I would actually prefer LESS chicken so that I could try other meat without feeling as if I am wasting food. The amount of beef on the other hand...was much less, which is great! It allowed us to order more. The salad was delicious.  I would go back but to another Gen (the one in TX) for another go....but not anytime soon.",

I think the only two things I have enjoyed are the #1 and the Korean chicken (can't remember the #) everything else just didn't suit my taste. The side dishes I didn't like but the kimchi was decent. Most of the meat that was thinly sliced is pointless eating because once it hits the grill it turns into pretty much nothing. The flavored Soju in the carafe was extremely disappointing because it was super watered down with a lot of ice.   This place is very trendy and Americanized but the vibe inside is nice if you enjoy that atmosphere. It's clean except somebody needs to get on them light fixtures above the tables because I saw dust falling off right on to our table which I wasn't happy about. The service was exceptional and our grill was changed at decent times during the busiest times on a Friday.   All in all Gen is decent but not great. I think people just really like the vibes inside and I do too but this is not a place I would choose often.",

    "text": "Ugh, I'm so torn. Immediately let me preface: Gen is currently the best KBBQ in the Phoenix area from meat quality and value. But having eaten at practically every California location, I hold Gen to a higher standard and they've disappointed me in more ways than one.  First the bon chon/side dish game was pretty weak. You see a lot of staples, mostly kimchi variants, and out of nowhere you see COLE SLAW! Just thought it was funny, the classic mayo sweet salad felt out of place. Also we had daikon but NO RICE PAPER!? And instead of the purple mixed rice I loved to eat, they just offered white rice which was just okay.  We ordered a carafe of lychee soju. I'm used to it being incredible sweet and delicious, but for some reason this had an incredibly harsh alcohol forward blend and we couldn't even finish it. Maybe it's a different mixologist who isn't trained since this place is new, who knows? Also might explain why it took us 10 minutes to get a server.  In terms of meats it was still an impressive spread, albeit slightly smaller around 35. A lot of the classics were there. Some of the more exotic jowl meat and large intestine wasn't present, and instead we had multiple variants of fried chicken. Crispy Cajun Chicken had good breading but was incredibly salty - pretty sure it was just blitzed in cajun salt. And the Volcano Chicken, while no BonChon, was pretty hot and hilarious to eat.   I don't know if my main issue was with inconsistent service or the occasional whitewashing of the already contemporary and accessible Gen. While excited a location finally opened here, I'm incredibly disappointed the ASU crowd can't enjoy the same experience we have across California. While that really only takes it down from a 10/10 to maybe a 7.5, knowing just how better it could be hurts the most.",

    "text": "I'm really loving the increase in excellent Asian restaurants to the East Valley! We came here around 5:45 on a Tuesday and there was no wait for a table of 5. Yes! As we left though it got a lot busier and there was definitely a line and a waitlist for tables.   The interior is modern and quite swanky with dim lighting and glowing blue accents. When we got seated one of the servers brought over some water and took our drink orders. Since we wanted to eat RIGHT NOW we already knew what 4 items to initially start with so we placed them immediately (One table can order up to 4 items at a time). In general, the servers will keep track of what time you sat down and you have a time limit of 2 hours to inhale all the delicious BBQ your stomach can handle! With 37 items to choose from you have quite a lot to decide on! We probably did about 7 rounds before we tapped out and declared mercy on our digestive systems. As soon as our meat order arrived we'd order another round to keep the flow going. I ate and ate and ate... I was sitting in the farthest corner of our booth a bit out of reach from the grill. My friends helped me out by placing random pieces of food on my plate from it so after a while I didn't even know what I was eating but it sure tasted great! Just keep eating, that's my motto!  Out of all the items my favorites were the smoked garlic pork belly and galbi. I was also impressed by the steak. If you order it, they will literally deliver a whole entire steak right to your table! We oohed and ahhhed over the sizzling sounds, the mouth-watering BBQ aromas emerging from our grilled paradise. In general I enjoyed all the meats we ordered and I have to say I think most of the meats and marinade tasted better than at regular Korean BBQ restaurants here in the Phoenix area.   Most of the items are raw meat that you cook, but they do offer foods such as Korean fried chicken which tasted more like General Tso's chicken but it was still delicious with crispy fried batter. The japchae was also interesting, it was plain clear noodles with no additional mix-ins and had a different flavor profile than what I've had in the past. One thing to note is that if you order the volcano chicken, prepare for Mt. Vesuvius to erupt onto your gustatory senses! My mouth was on fire and after the spiciness died down, my palate felt a bit numb as if the food had chemically burned it lol. It's basically the same battered fried chicken as the KFC, but doused with a nuclear hot sauce.  Some minor points. While service was very friendly and for the most part attentive (Which is much appreciated if you're on a time limit), there were some small annoyances such as not receiving any tongs for the meat or an extra plate of sauce even though they were requested. No worries on our part since we just grabbed them from the nearby service cart. One of the servers was considerate enough to let us know about the uneaten food policy near our 7th round of food (Perhaps this is a sign we are incurable gluttons), that there is a charge for any uneaten food on your plate.  Even the banchan was quite tasty and very plentiful. Your AYCE experience also comes with a big bowl of rice which was nicely cooked, a tray of 3 sauces (Green tea salt, sesame oil, a sweet brownish sauce) and a light salad.   Overall we all had a good time and I'd love to go back again for all you can MEAT!  4.5/5",

Like how can I show my friends the korean tradition on drinking that soju bottle. Oh well food was still good though.",

Would highly recommend for KBBQ",

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because they bring tiny portions of the different Korean sides (Kimchi, pickles, etc).  You can ask for more but it's just kind of a pain. If they're afraid of waste maybe put a little bar of the sides and people can grab what they want.  Also, they tell you in the beginning it's $5/plate upcharge if you don't finish your food.",

I think all the meats were of really good quality and the staff was really helpful (including allowing us to swap out the grill plates when we needed unlike some other places I've been to). The grill itself was not really oiled well so the meat stuck sadly, and the staff told us that the grill plates were non-stick (even though they appeared to have no non-stick coating etc).  We also liked their sides and the JapChae that we ordered (all fresh and tasty). Overall, it was a good experience food wise but would advise that you go early or else you'll be waiting for awhile (you can register and walk out to go somewhere else and they'll text you but they only give you 5 minutes to show up).  I'll definitely come again but maybe at dinner to try out there additional offerings.",

The worst quality food I think I've ever seen at a restaurant. After choking down as much food as we could manage because of the ridiculous rule that you will be charged $5 per plate of unfinished food, my husband went to the restroom. Only to find out the soap dispenser in the men's room didn't work! No soap in the bathroom because it was broken! When he approached the manager about this the manager actually had the nerve to tell us that he knew it didn't work, he was sent \"the wrong soap\" for the dispenser. He was also very rude to us and tried to make it seem like we were being difficult. He literally could have walked next door to bath & body works and completely solved that issue, but he said he had \"done everything he could to make the soap work\".  This was easily the worst experience I think I've ever had at a restaurant, in terms of quality, service, friendliness, etc... I would never recommend this place to anyone, and I will never go back. all we can do now I hope we didn't get food poisoning from the $65 inedible meal we received, as I'm pretty sure the calamari was spoiled.",

The experience of cooking it at your table was awesome but the way the anxiety of getting your money's worth while not over ordering as to not get an additional charge ($5.00) was just too much for me. I will definitely go back again and again but for lunch time (16.00) or happy hour drink only.  Overall it was a great experience",

I get it - I've lined up for hours for food before and know when to expect it.   Coming at 11:40am on a Saturday for lunch, I expected at least 1.5h of a wait. I was so pleasantly surprised to hear it would only be 45 min! After returning in 50 minutes (and having bought a small snack to tide me over), we still received no text. Going to ask the hostess about the wait time, she said it would be another hour. Which also turned out to be False bc we waited longer still... Chatting with some other groups of friends, they had very similar stories of being led on with ever increasing wait times.   I'm so disappointed with their wait estimation. I think I stay pretty open minded especially with new restaurant ooenings, but generally I'm still given ample notice. With a 3-4h wait, I could be halfway to LA or SD for kbbq...  I really wish I could give a higher star review but I think the False wait times and my hangry belly just won't let me. Maybe I'll check back in a few months with better luck :/",

    "text": "Yay! Super excited we finally have a legit AYCE KBBQ place in AZ! I've already been twice in the less than a month they've been open. Once on a Friday night around 7pm and once on a Sunday afternoon - waited 1.5 hours both times. I hear a lot of complaints about the wait; but for me, it's not so bad. I'm a seasoned line-waiter. Lol. Little Miss BBQ anyone? How about the 3 hr wait Pizzeria Bianco days? Or Boiling Crab when they first started out? At least here you can go explore Tempe Marketplace to kill time.  Now onto to the real stuff - the meat! I was with four hungry dudes, so I was able to try a lot of the items they had to offer. My favorites include: Hawaiian Pork Belly Brisket Pork Jowl - cook it longer to get it crispy Garlic Calamari Beef Tongue Galbi  Other favorites at the table: Garlic Pork Belly - tastes like little smokies sausages Cajun Shrimp Flat Iron Steak Premium Pork Belly Hawaiian Steak  Not so great: Octopus - maybe we cooked it wrong, but none of us enjoyed this. Garlic Chicken - got it for the cheese fondue that comes with it but the cheese was not good. Bulgogi - wasn't a fan of the marinade but looks to be most people's favorite, so I'll have to try this again next time.  Tip: By the time you get seated you're probably hangry from the long wait. Order thin cuts of meat the first round or two (brisket, beef tongue, flat iron steak).They cook quickly and you can start eating while you wait for the longer cooking items in the next rounds.   $24.99 per person for dinner and all day on the weekends. $15.99 for lunch Monday through Friday.",

KBBQ is on our to do list every california con so we have standards. We know that when a KBBQ place comes to AZ, there is going to be a wait. We planned accordingly, signed up on the wait list and just did our thang in Tempe Marketplace. We were quoted 2.5 hours and got in about an hour and 45 minutes later. It's an all you can eat so of course that it was enticed us to go. We got all-out typical sides and ordered many more to come (I am pretty sure our server was like thought we were endless vaccumns as we order endless amounts of rice paper; we know what want). The Brisket is good. We ordered pork belly, bulgolgi and so much more. Our server, Dohee, was hilarious. Awesome. And everything your want in a KBBQ place. Soju was awesome! Very generous. The only tiff we had was that we were rushed out later. Not our servers fault. We're con kids. When you go to KBBQ, you keep ordering. AZ has a lot of catching up to do to understand all you can eat is ALL YOU CAN EAT. Haha. Waiting for a long time, you're going to want to stay because you paid your dues. So next time we go, if we get rushed out again, well post GEN on 4chan and be ashamed anonymously we did it but still not regret it because we should be able to eat that brisket as much as want. All in all, still recommended. We will be back!",

    "text": "Finally, the popular California chain is in AZ.  Unfortunately, there's a 2hr+ wait if you go after 5pm on any day of week.  If you have a large party then good luck...they only have high tops that fit large parties and no kids are allowed at those.  Otherwise, you will have to wait for two booths (sits 5-6 people each) next to or across from each other to open up simultaneously.  Good thing is they will text you when table is ready so you could go early and put name on waitlist then go shop around Tempe Marketplace.  Once you get in, all the wait will be redeemed with limitless meat for $24.99 ($15.99 only for weekday lunch!).  I like that they offer all meats for one price unlike some kbbq's that have different tiers of pricing and quality. Meats are mostly good quality with the pork belly being AMAZING and best I've ever had!  Kalbi also better than other places and their premium steak is great too.  The one thing Gen has that others don't is the thin rice paper to wrap your meat.  I was excited that they had radish wraps but was weirded out by odd taste thats unlike the pickled radish wraps I've had.  The meat comes out fast and they frequently change your grill.  Overall, good service once you get in but not a super kid-friendly environment with the club scene lighting and loud hip hop music.  It is still fun all around!",

We were greeted right away and was able to order our food within 5 min of being seated! The waiter that day never let our glasses get empty and always made sure we weren't waiting to be helped! Overall a great first experience! The second time we came we brought friends to the restaurant so they too can experience great food and hospitality unfortunately it did not start off that way! We were seated with in a reasonable time when we checked it! However once we were seated, it took 10 min for someone to come over and greet us at the table. Finally after waiting, someone came and took our drink order, we ordered our first set of 4 and waited 10 min(felt longer) for those to come out! Throughout our dinner we felt the food was not coming out as quickly as last time, we kept having food we didn't order dropped at our table, and the waitress maybe came by a few times out of the 2 hours we were there. It felt like we had 5 waiters/waitresses during our stay only because we had to ask others for either a refill or for more food! Thankfully the food spoke loud enough for the lack of customer service. Hopefully next time we recommend this place the service will be better! The food deserves 5 stars but the service needs help! We have a GEN in Hawaii and everyone that works there loves what they do and it reflects on their service! Hopefully the service at this GEN will hold up its end because the food is great!!",

    "text": "My husband and I went for date night, we like to try out different things and neither of us had ever been!  It was an hour wait and we went back to the bar. I ordered a vodka and cran,tall and my husband a beer. The counter needed to be cleaned off and the bartender didn't know what he was doing. My vodka cran tasted liked cranberry juice with no vodka. I mentioned this twice and he didn't do anything. The other bartender was more helpful. They also ran out of ice that night because the ice machine was broken. All drinks weren't very cold.  Once seated, our server was to busy to explain the process of this and we had to guess at what to do and how long to cook things. They have a beautiful set up of things but if you haven't ever been and no one explains it, it's pointless.  I didn't find the food to be anything wonderful and because our server was to busy we didn't know what to order or what to expect.  We will not return and I hope that they realize that this type of environment calls for explaining and taking time with your guests, not pushing them through to get to the next table and tip.",

After having had Korean BBQ one other time in Vancouver, my taste buds were definitely excited. The servers were super nice and gave us a run down of the rules....so.many.rules. And one of the reasons for taking away a star. Once we got it all figured out, we started ordering away!  Definitely a great selection with 37 items to choose from...only bummer is you can only order 4 items at a time. Luckily, they were super quick when you put in additional orders so there was never really a lag. I enjoyed all of the items we tried...bulgogi, short ribs, pork belly, steak, chicken, gyoza, shrimp, noodle salad...and I have to say the rice was perfectly done!  I wish there were a little more variety in the sides and the shrimp was a little fresher but, overall, a great value and experience!",

Well we did it and it was totally worth it. The staff is all so attentive in checking on you during dinner and we had a blast cooking the meat. The beef tongue and Hawaiian pork belly were some of our faves but honestly all the meat was wonderfully seasoned and so juicy. My son loved the KFC which is already fried up when it comes to the table. 2 hours is the time you get to eat/cook and we used almost all of it to just rest in between cooking more meat. We will definitely be back.",

I have literally been waiting all summer for this restaurant to open since they announced the news! I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch ($15.99) and there was about a 15-20 minute wait - no big deal. Again, being from California and having tried other Korean BBQ restaurants in Phoenix, I didn't have too high of expectations for Gen. But man, to say that I was satisfied with my experience would be an understatement! The food was good, definitely MUCH better quality than any Korean BBQ restaurant I've been to out here. But what made the experience so amazing was the service! Our server was Ly and all throughout our meal, he was sweet and so helpful - constantly checking on us to make sure we were doing okay. We made some out of the ordinary requests but he made sure we were taken care of and our needs were met. Having worked in the hospitality industry before, I literally left the restaurant thinking, \"That was the best service I've gotten in a really long time.\" Now onto the food, we ordered the premium steak, pork jowl, smoked garlic pork belly, regular pork belly, Korean fried chicken (KFC). All were really delicious except we weren't huge fans of the smoked pork belly as it just tasted like bacon...? But either way, I was so happy with my experience and can't wait to be back!   Tip: if you ask them for rice paper, they have it. :)",

There is a 2 hour limit for eating, so make sure you order your meat fast and strategically. I personally loved beef belly more than their chadol (which is usually my fav) so order a lot of that!! Pork belly was flavorless and disappointing. Their drink was so fun! I got the yogurt soju and it was surprisingly strong haha. Its loud inside, so i wouldnt recommend it for your first date, but def a fun place for friends ! Will definitely be returning :)",

You have to be a serious eater to get close to eating that much worth of this type of food.  The smoke. It's a bunch of little indoor BBQs. They need better ventilation IMO.

However we were truly disappointed from the moment we sat down and if I could give it 0 stars I would. Our party was 3 people and as soon as we sat down we noticed the table was dirty, the plates were dirty, the grill was dirty. It looked like they just wiped down the table. We sat there for about 15 minutes before anyone came up to ask if we wanted any drinks or if we were ready to order. We ended up having two different waiters,  the second waitress claimed to not know our table was hers. After we asked for a clean grill and plates neither one ever showed back up to our table again after that. We had to get the attention of ANYONE who would walk by for service. We had to ask the busboy for more rice, who came back faster than anyone else. We even asked one of the managers for more food. At one point one of the hostess came over when she noticed us looking around for anyone and when we told her everything she said she would let her manager know. The manager later came over to our table and let us know that someone had called out for a family emergency and so the staff was confused over their sections. However while I completely understand this situation it does not excuse the dirty table before we even sat down when so many busboys were just walking around. Does not excuse the fact that we had to hunt down the staff for service. Hope their communication improves and it doesn't happen to anyone else because it was terrible.",

They provide an endless supply of meat that you cook in the middle of your table that comes with a side of seasonings and rice for you to compliment your food. They exchange the grills almost every time you ask for more protein which is helpful in keeping the flavor crisp every time you cook. One of my new favorite spots to visit when I am in the area.",

Several of the things we ordered were forgotten, despite reminding the server several times. Additionally, it took over 20 minutes to get our waters and drinks from the bar. When the drinks did arrive, almost a third of mine was spilled on my friend. They did not offer to refill it or even apologize to my friend for spilling it on her. My other friends soft drink never made it to the table.   The food was good, when it arrived. Like I said, several of the dishes we ordered never made it to our table. I liked the idea of cooking it ourselves at the table. I wish they gave more sides/seasonings.   The atmosphere isn't the best. They are constantly rushing everything (you have a two hour timer) despite having plenty of time left for your table. Each server we encountered used the excuse that it was busy and that's why we were getting bad service, however, this place is always busy, so I guess they just have bad service all the time. One server, Michael, was really trying and he's the only reason my review is 2 stars instead of 1.   Honestly, I would skip this place.",

Everyone tipped separately because they didnt tell us about the service charge. So they double charged us on drinks and double charged for the tips. The manager was not helpful in handling this issue",

I recommend the top sirloin (shockingly better than most ribeyes) and all pork bellies especially the one marinaded in red wine.   Hype or not this will be my go to for KBBQ",

The service was ok, the beer was flat (as was the soda), the meat was not edible (spoiled) in most cases and mediocre at the best of times. When I was finished with what I could stomach of the meal I went to use the bathroom and to my dismay the soap dispenser was almost full and not working. When I found this out I immediately asked for my check, tipped, and left only to be confronted by the manager nonchalantly telling me he knew that the only men's restroom in the place had essentially no soap. I'll be lucky if this experience only costs me $80 and not a few days off work due to food-borne illness. Would not go back even if they comped my meals for life.",

That being said, our server seemed nervous and had difficulty answering our questions about the seasonings, how to cook the food and what combinations were common.  The premium steak was good, but the flank steak was disappointing. We did try a few of the seafood items, which were fresh.  The restaurant ambiance is nice, but the romance dips every time a new guest arrives and is loudly greeted with welcome to Gen.  For us the cost didn't meet our dining experience.",

The server started with explaining about the restaurant and then all the RULES.....reading through the rules section at the bottom of the menu. So apparently they're REALLy focused on people wasting food or just plain cheap. (Of course they need rules but this seems overboard)  Also you will get charged $25 bucks if someone in your party isn't eating.  I'd suggest going to Fogo de Chao at lunch and basically pay the same amount. Get some lessons on how they run the restaurant and create a better atmosphere for guests.   We started laughing when he was reviewing them almost like it was a joke....if you have children they charge by height like it's a carnival. There's a rules section at the top of the menu for that.  They do have a large menu and you can order 4 items at a time for a table if 4. It was clean and fresh but there's nothing special about quality of the meat. The sirloin is possibly a select grade and was incredibly tough.   I guess we didn't get it...I see the reviews and many people loved it. But we were sitting there getting maybe 6- 8 oz of thin sliced meat (like for cheesesteaks) for the table. Throwing on some seasoning and then grilling yourself.   We came up with this description: A cook your own food, Asian Style cuisine, Homestyle Buffet in a beautiful setting.",

The portions are large which is great, but if you'd like only a half order they will do that too! That way you aren't wasting food. You can request a salad and rice to accompany the meal. My favorite on the menu is the Hawaiian Pork Belly and the Spicy Pork Bulgogi! To die for! Also, you can go for lunch during the week for only $15.99. Such a good deal! My only other tip is to get there early because they get full fast and it's a long wait!",

    "text": "First of all, this place has good food and equivalent to that of Korean BBQ in Los Angeles. Gen BBQ is like the Starbucks of Korean BBQ in California; they're everywhere. They are good but there are better places in California, of course.  Arizona location, this is by far the best place for AYCE Korean BBQ, for now. Until more restaurants like this opens, this will be the top choice for now. Great quality meets and the service was actually pretty good even though they are still in their \"soft-opening\" stage. Inside was very modern, clean and great atmosphere. Don't mind the smoke and smell of Korean bbq, that is a for-sure thing if you are going to a Korean BBQ place. If anyone complains about it, then they don't know anything about Korean BBQ. Their side dishes were great too  I took off a star because at the end, when it came to paying the bill, they had a very hard time getting everything to work properly. We had 7 people and they said they only take 3 credit cards maximum which is fine. So we paid cash and 3 credit cards; Cash first, fixed amount on 2 cards and the rest on the last one. Apparently this was very difficult because of their system. I work in the industry too but Im pretty sure almost every POS system can take more than 3 credit cards but to save time (and money) it makes sense limit to 3 but, not sure why, they weren't able to efficiently carry the transactions smoothly. Guess they need more of a efficient POS. Also, they only have a very limited tables for large parties (like 8+) so if you have a party of 8 or more, you may need to wait longer for a table if its already taken.  For those new to Korean BBQ, here is a few things to consider. Ayce Korean BBQ places do not take reservations and never have or will. Its first come, first serve if ALL your party is present since there is a 2 hour max once your start eating. The maximum time frame is a must for every ayce BBQ so don't complain. Lastly, there will always be a wait so plan ahead. All the ayce korean bbq places in LA are the exact same thing when it comes to waiting.",

The meats are delicious and fill you up! I'm a big fan of the pork belly and their mashed potatoes were surprisingly good. My only issue with this place, like with others, is the REALLY long wait. We went on a Friday at around 7, and had to wait a little over 2 hours for a table. But at least the food makes up for it. It's conveniently located at the Tempe Marketplace, so you can walk around while you wait for a text that a table is ready. Another con is that we had to sit up on the bar stools in the middle of the restaurant. At that point, we were HANGRY, and not eating and leaving because of a bar stool was not an option. I preferred a booth but oh well. Touching elbows with a stranger isn't the best experience! The waiters were attentive, but some of our orders got mixed up which is understandable since it was hectic!   My conclusion: only go here if you are willing to wait for a table and have time to spare!",

I was so excited when I found out Gen was coming to The Valley as I had frequented their CA locations on several occasions. I visited this location on a Sunday afternoon and it did not disappoint! The wait for a table was about an hour but it was well worth the wait. The food and service were great. For almost $25 you can get a an amazing all you can eat dinner. This restaurant is also very nice on the inside and I like the ambiance. Full bar and lots of TV's. If you like BBQ definitely check this place out!",

I have tried many other restaurants and originally being raised in California, I always craved good Korean BBQ and couldn't get it till now. The service is kind and always looking out for anything you need. The food is the highest quality than any of the other Korean restaurants. And the price for the selection is very honest.",

    "text": "Went here during the first opening week, so we waited outside for 3 hours. Not bad for an opening week (there are shops, D & B, Barns and Nobles all in close proximity to help pass the time). And then it was our turn.  The ambiance is a cool, clean blue lights, and not too smoky (which is good, meaning they change out the grill often).   We were a party of 5 of people, and honestly the amount of side dishes were small, so therefore we asked for multiple \"refills\" and the frequency of food coming out are slow. With the slowness, I can understand since it was opening week so I expect the place to be busy. But the side dishes are so small that we have to ask for multiple refills, and when they are coming slow... there were multiple times where our table was just empty with no food or side dishes since there were nothing that come out.  Overall, the portions are a bit small and so are the side dishes. However, I do feel that if your party is only 2, then it will be fine. Any bigger than 2, expect the wait for food and side dishes to come out.",
