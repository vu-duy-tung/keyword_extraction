It wasn't the best I've had, but was tasty enough to satisfy my Tres Leches cravings now that I won't be returning to Houston on a regular basis any longer. The cake was moist and sweet. There was a little too much \"frosting\" on top for my liking, but that can always be scraped off. Next time I'd like to try the chocolate.",

    "text": "My husband and I lovingly refer to Phoenix Ranch Market as Food City on Crack!  This place is amazing, but be prepared for a bit of culture shock as this is a truly authentic Mexican grocery store.  I have only walked the perimeter of the store, which is the bakery, fish market and carneceria.   The bakery is phenomenal,  I would especially recommend the dulce de leche cake.  Next stop fish market, with an excellent seafood spread.  You can order food-to-go straight from the market, I recommend the shrimp ceviche.  Next stop the meat market - Wow!  Some interesting food you would not find at your local Albertson's.  Carne Asada (marinated) is an excellent and cheap choice to take home and have a mexican bbq in your very own backyard.    The restaurant next door is also very good - great seafood enchiladas.  There are also soom little shops with items you would expect to find at a border town shop.",

And the market has the lowest prices for vegetables.  Cucumbers 6 for $1.00 and radishes 3 for $1.00!  I bought a large package of chicken breasts (5 big breasts) and they were only $4.32!  Went home and roasted them up the oven for chicken tacos.  The chicken was perfect.  Next time I'm there my plan is to stock up on chicken breasts for the freezer.  Did I mention the bakery?  Anyway, it's all good.",

    "text": "Ok, so I was craving a bomb style torta de asada. Not to knock AZ critics, but most reviews on Mexican spots are rather forgiving. Growing up in East Los Angeles (and no, I never banged), I think I have a good sense on what actually cuts the mustard as far as street type faire. In order of importance on my review scale is 1) sabor/taste, 2) condiments, 3) price & 4) cleanliness.  After reading the reviews I decided to head over to Ranch Market over the other spots because we wanted to pick-up    a few things that we find difficult to find in Prescott. What can I say about the cleanliness? Top notch, except the shopping carts. But I guess when everybody is loading up, they are bound to get a bit beaten.   We spent only $25 bucks to max out on tacos, tortas, & aguas frescas for 4 of us. Just like any other market, compare prices. I noticed standard & sometimes higher prices for everyday staples. Eggs, milk, frozen vegetables, etc. We found quite a few things (cheese, chiles and produce) that we couldn't avoid paying the price, because you are not going to find it at Fry's.   The food court is the place to start your shopping. You don't wanna shop on an empty stomach anyway. My son & I had tortas de asada & I threw in a taco de lengua (tongue). My wife had the chile relleno plate, and our youngest had a bean & cheese burrito. While the torta does come with lettuce, tomato, onion and cheese; we asked for them to include avocado.   The salsa bar missed on a few things; radishes, carrots with the jalapenos, and a hot green chile type salsa. The taco de lengua came plain, but the chunks of lengua were a bit oversized.  After adding some onions & cilantro I missed not having green chili so I substituted it for their toasted red salsa.  My son gave his burrito rave reviews. He stated \"this is Mexico\". He also gave the Orchata (rice water) a thumbs up. My wife wolfed-down her chile relleno so I'll take it she liked it. My torta fell short of excellance, I think the meat needed some more seasoning or wasn't marinated long enough, it could also be most taco trucks serve to order. What I mean is the meat isn't prepared until you order it. But hey, I didn't leave anything behind. The taco de lengua was not bad, I need to try it again because I didn't so much taste it as attack it. Did I mention the tamarindo was great, not to sweet, not too watered down.  Topping the whole experience off... We took home some pan dulce & bullios (sweet bread & rolls). Yummy goodness. I'll go back soon and review the menudo.",

    "text": "Well, it's probably all been said and been done about this place. Today I finally made the trip inside the store, rather than just going to the restaurant on the side. It was too early for lunch at Tradiciones so in I went. I knew that the market had a lot going on at all times; I nearly run down at least 6 people getting in and out of the parking lot and I'm a really good driver (seriously-not Raymond from Rain Man good, but actually good!). The parking lot on the store side is always packed.  So the focus of my trip was the cucina. It was bustling for lunch already at just 10:30. So as I'm trying to make sense of the menus posted in both Spanish and English on the wall above the hot food line or whatever, I am greeted by a nice woman that helps me decide where to go. She mentioned sopes first, so that's what I started with.  My order was way too much food for one, but I wanted to try a couple of things. So I got both a chicken and a steak sopa, a street taco al pastor (pork), and a side of beans. They did have combos unlike another reviewer said but I only wanted to add beans an opted for a side instead. My total for food was $11.00. Not super cheap, but like I said more food than I would normally order at once.    So a sope for those unfamilar is not a torta as someone else said. It's more like a weird tostada or open faced sandwich. The base is somewhere between a corn tortilla and an all out bread. It does appear to be flash fried to cook but I'm not totally sure and it didn't feel greasy. The sides are curved to make a small cup to fill with beans, meat of choice, topped with shredded lettuce, grated cojita cheese (I'd describe Mexican parm--hard salty and good!!) The chicken and steak were both tasty. The steak was a little strung together if you will. I'd rather have seen it be chopped better so I would be easier to eat smaller bites. If your teeth didn't make it through that bite, a big chunk was coming along with it. Sorta messy but good though I felt like my sopa was a bit tougher than it should be and my extra cheap plastic fork would bend to the will of the sope.  The street taco was just so I could taste the al pastor. Two tiny corn tortillas topped with a bit of pork. I topped it with onions and cilantro and would totally eat the al pastor in another dish.   Beans. Not a really a fan. They lacked the taste of say Carolina's beans though the texture matched. A disappointment.   Salsa bar was good. Hot green and red, and the pico was spicy too. Fresh onions and chopped cilantro are a must so it was good to have those.   Agua Fresca...Just love it. I had the fresh guava juice. So tasty and well worth the additional $2.91 I spent for the 32oz drink.   Total food and drink, $13.91. A little spendy for lunch served in stryo while seated on a bench, but it was fun and I will order a little differently next time so it won't be as expensive and I won't order more food than I can eat.  Market, looks good. Great looking bakery (really), meat counter, tortilla factory, etc. I'll probably not go out of my way to get there for things I can buy at Food City on a regular day. This does look like a fun way to go get some lunch before you shop for dinner on a weekend. I'll definitely take others for hot food and a fun people watching experience, plus pick up a few goods on the way.   I don't really know about authentic. It's probably not. I don't really care. My dad's family is from near the Mexican border and though I've been to mercados in Mexico and even here, I liked that this place is busy and clean. Campy, sure. But like I care!",

The service we had was terrible when we went for breakfast one morning. The guy at the counter was not very professional and made this face when we asked for eggs, it was like he only wanted us to buy something already made.  When we used to go before they were always more than willing to cook us whatever we needed. On my way back to my table, an employee even walked right into me with no apology!

It has different markets under one roof: a carniceria of all types of marinated meats, a cremaria with a variety of cheese from different Mexican regions, a huge on-site panaderia w/ delicious baked goods, a tortilleria which had a conveyor belt of white and corn tortillas coming down the line. There was also a juice bar serving all types of jugos naturales. There is a big area of prepared foods serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. We didn't try the food as we already ate lunch, however, we will come back here again.",

    "text": "Let me make this review short and sweet.  Food?  Good.  Get the carne asada anything.  You can see them cooking it outside on some afternoons and you have got to have it once you smell it.  Service?  Awful.  Just try getting your waiter to your table once your food has been delivered.  Want the check?  Wait thirty minutes, walk around looking for ANYONE to help you.  They tell you they will send your server.  You wait another twenty minutes.  You start to estimate how much your bill is and start to count up how much cash you have on hand and the server shows up with your bill.  It is wrong.  You can't afford to waste any more precious time here, so you pay $15 too much anyway.  Or maybe that's just my experience!  Come for the food and, perhaps, get your check when you're done ordering just to save some time.  I'm not saying to stay away.  The food is delicious.  Definitely come.  But they call it \"Mexican Time\" for a reason.",

The only improvement I can see them making is providing bicycle racks at there location. As a safe place to park one's bike as it adds to a safer, cleaner, and friendly downtown Phoenix! Cheers!",

    "text": "I was so excited to visit Ranch Market, as I never have before. I have been to Food City near my house, which I love, but I heard Ranch Market was like a Food City on steroids.  I was disappointed by a few things...  First the good. It's huge and has every Mexican delicacy you can think of. Awesome bakery, tortilleria, hot foods, huge cheese section, random pig body parts in the cheese section.   My tummy was growling so I decided to get a bean burrito before I shopped. The people working there were quite disorganized. There were 2 people ahead of me. I person ordered a cup of green chili and the other person ordered a side of rice. Between 3 employees it took 5 minutes to get our three orders out. After getting my burrito, I turn around and my cart with a couple items in it was gone! I seriously turned my back just for 30 seconds. It was obvious it was mine... hmmmm.  Luckily the burrito was delicious. Do not underestimate the power of a good, simple bean burrito. The tortilla was puffy, the beans creamy, the cheese gooey. Yum.  I go get myself another cart and by the time I get to the produce section I realize the handle of my cart is quite sticky. Yuck. Thank God for hand sanitizer in my purse.  Yes, the produce section is huge and has great variety. I saw some childhood favorites there... nopales, jicama, etc. The sale prices on produce were very good. However, the quality of some items were bad. The tomatoes were on sale, but they weren't even ripe. They were pale pink. I didn't even bother. The lemons were mushy and infested with flies.   The condition of the store in general was run down and dirty. A cooler holding frozen fruit was filthy. The lack of sanitation made me a bit nervous.  Also making me nervous were the many unsupervised children running amok, pulling things off shelves and just creating chaos. I almost accidentally hit a few with my cart.   Still, I came out of Ranch Market with lots of produce, lots of pork for carnitas, fresh cheeses, fresh tortillas all for under $30. With a delicious bean burrito in my belly. Yep, I call it a good night.",

    "text": "Today I wanted horchata.  Today I found horchata.  And a whole lot more.   Thanks to Massv Genius on Yelp here, I was handedly convinced to walk into and experience the Phoenix Ranch Market.  Man, what an assault on the senses when you walk in through the left entrance. An Elvis Crespo merengue track blaring from the store speakers. A giant food court in front of me - a section for cakes, another for other pastries, another for tacos/burritos, and many more, including the aforementioned jugeria (Spanish for jugeria). A guy dressed as a pantomime making kids balloon animals. And this is only 10% of the entire store!   I was kind of petrified because I didn't even know where to begin. I wanted to eat everything. I wanted to drink everything. I wanted to do grocery shopping now even though I had 4 more errands to do.  Horchata.   And so I went to the jugeria and ordered a large cup. Wow. I was chillin' on cloud nine with the first sip. I then took a leisurely jaunt around the rest of the store.  This place is MASSIVE. And extremely colorful. I can see people making a day of it. It's like a grocery store and a street carnival all wrapped up under one roof. But that's not all.  Mariachis!  Yes, Mariachis stationed by the other entrance, next to a display of \"Ingles Sin Fronteras\" CDs. This store is a kind of wonderland, with an adjoining section with a more sit-down restaurant plus stalls selling arts & crafts from Mexico.   I will definitely be coming back here many, many times.  This is it. My Mexican Disneyland.",

Birthday cakes for kiddies--- wow- talk about a frickin' cool Dora the Explorer cake, or a Spongebob cake-- it put Costco and Aunt Cindy to shame.  3.  Meat-- this meat case is LOADED, even if you don't want to buy fresh meat, just go there to look at it.   4.  The affordabiltiy-- C&H Sugar was $1.19 at Ranch Market and $2.99 at any other grocery (non sale priced).    It's like a party in this place, the last time I was there was right before the holidays and I found myself just having a good ol' time grabbing the chips for a work party.  I even stopped by the jewelry counter and contemplated purchasing a 3 inch gold cross, but decided against it.  :o)",

Grab a strawberries and cream cup by the juice stand.  it's a great way to end a very tasty and satiating meal.  If atmosphere isn't important, save yourself mucho dinero by skipping Tradiciones and eat at the food court.  I tried to dine at the seafood counter twice, but both times the kitchen had just closed.    To elaborate on the pollo deshuesado- I believe it's chargrilled chunks of chicken (wonderfully marinated and perfectly caramelized) with slices of tomato and crispy lettuce on telera bread.  Ah, telera!  So, so good!  I don't even recall any condiments added.  Just chicken, veggies, and the bread.    Why not rate PRM five stars?  Two reasons:   Bad guacamole- it tasted like water- so thinned-down, and yet at the same time had a congealed look about it.  PRM should be ashamed of itself for serving such a sub-par product!  Oh, well.  I shouldn't eat avocados anyway...   Rice served has corn in it-  It's also served this way in the formal restaurant Tradiciones.  Don't get me wrong- I love corn, but my immune system does not.  Why not offer plain rice as an option?  Rice and beans make a perfect protein combo  Why deny me of it?  At least I can always look forward to the tortas.",

This store has some incredible sales and nice fresh produce. We have recently changed our diets to be mostly fruits & vegetables, and luckily they have a nice wide selection of both and it only takes us about 5-10 minutes to get to and from.  The reason I gave this store 4 stars is because they don't seem to stock pretzels of ANY kind (bagged or fresh hot) and it's very difficult to find a shopping basket.  They have plenty of rolling shopping carts, but we are both in wheelchairs so we need a basket to put on our laps while we shop.  Other than that, we are both happy with the food and overall very happy with the prices on the produce. The employees have all been nice and quick to accommodate if needed. We also shop at Whole Foods, but it's 3x further away, so this is where we will be shopping most of the time!",

I am so overwhelmed when I go here, I am in sensory overload.  Mexican bread is 5 for $2, bolillos are 6 for $1, tons of seafood, fresh chorizo ( which I have been eating everyday for a week ), tons of snacks packaged by Ranch Market for super cheap, you can get a meal for 4 people for $10 ( carnitas, rice, beans, tortillas ) and tons of other specialty items. The atmosphere is fun and inviting and everyone is friendly. This store has inspired me to create new dishes at home, like my homemade beans and chorizo.   Go here, eat some of their prepared foods that are inexpensive and delicious OR get some fresh ingredients and make something yummy at home.  See ya soon Ranch Market.",

When I want what is perhaps the freshest vegetables in the city possible or am craving some Bunuelo - I head to PRM!    Their meat department is CRAZY NUTS!  Need pigs feet or a whole cow head.  Here's your place.  Depending on the day, this place can be a madhouse.  Their produce department - Always fresh...and cheap!  Where else can you get green onions for $1.00 for 3 large bunches.   Pastries?  Uhhh, did I mention the Bunuelos?  Cakes and other treats are always being made and decorated when I walk in.    Fresh tortillas always being made at the Tortilleria.  There they are standing in a row.  Big ones.  Small ones.  Some as big as your head.  Deedly Dee! ;)  If ever I'm feeling lazy and not wanting to make my own salsa - I'm going to hit up the salsa bar here.  I've tried the salsas with food from the food court and it's always tasty.  And speaking of the  food court - I've eaten here quite a number of times.  Very tasty no mater what you get.  And I've almost gotten it all.

    "text": "I love horchata. Their horchata alone would be 5 starts.  Sweet and creamy without being overly sweet, and not that fake powder stuff!! The other aguas frescas looked very good. Wish I had more friends with me to sample the rest.   I didn't find the food itself to be anything special. Taco meats were dry so I just piled on onions, cilantro, lime and salsa verde. Ceviche was good but had a slight hint of \"fishiness.\"  5 tacos for $6 was ok, but I was expecting cheaper for some reason. I think their whole cooked meats are a better deal - $7 for a whole pollo asado, 5.99/lb ribs and carnitas. I didn't try it, but come with a few people and split those items or take home.   There are some great deals to be found in the rest of the market.  3lb/99c bananas, 59c/lb white onion, 10lb/$1 watermelon are things I remember. Come here if you want your Mexican nopales (cactus), peppers, spices,  and the like.  Some of the fruits and produce looked great, others not so much.  So I guess you'd have to be lucky for what you need to be fresh.    Maybe if I'm craving menudo on weekends, I might come back to try.",

I was like, \"$5 off a $25 purchase, SAY WHAAAT?\" Turns our Pro's had gone into bankruptcy and emerged under the joint ownership of a couple other Hispanic market chains. Fun facts but the coupon got me down there Saturday morning.   Same old Ranch Market with shoes for sale up front, the assortment of prepared food, drink, and bakery items, and chicharones from bite size to mucho grande. I like their produce and meat selection but wish they carried salmon other than the frozen bags. Still, it was a good reminder of the shopping experiences I had before my current battles at my local Fry's and Basha's stores. I suggest we all commit to hitting Ranch Market a little more.",

I walked in the door to a very colorful (literally) scene packed full of people. Upon entering I was offered a sample of ricotta cheese on a piece of tostada.  What a great way to start a visit I love samples, I love cheese, and new places.  Words can not fully describe how eclectic this place is. There are many types of foods that you will not find anywhere else.  The perimeter of the market is dotted with cafe's from a Fish one, street deserts, juices, bakery and Mexican food.   I oped for the fish cafe, I had the fried talipa vera cruz. There was several pieces of lightly battered talipa covered in a fresh mix of olives, peppers onions and tomatoes.  It came with 5 fresh corn tortillas, rice and beans all for $5.73.    I took the meal to the other side of the store to have it with my friend who had Mexican food. I enhanced my meal with the many items from the salsa bar, included fried peppers, and a avocado salsa. It was a great meal especially for the price.   My friend had the barbacoa, which he also really enjoyed.  Part of the fun was the sheer exotic nature of the whole market. My co worker who is from mexico said it was just like the markers in Mexico.   I will return again as there are many many exotic (to me) things I still wish to try and at the low prices I can afford to try them all.",

Being a visitor from upstate New York, it is hard to find Hispanic products in such variety and at such great prices.  I bought plenty of home-made corn tortillas, nopal leaves (edible cactus) and seasonings.  I also had the chance to have lunch there.  I had the three taco combo platter (I had carne asada, pollo asado and al pastor), which came with rice beans, and a few totopos.  They were delicious, and I paid $6.99 plus tax for it!  The highlight of my meal must have been the pina colada agua fresca I got from the agua fresca bar.  It was natural pineapple juice blended with coconut.  It was cold and sweet and served in a very sturdy plastic cup I could have saved for my trip back to NY.  What an awesome place.",

It's the closest Market to my house, it's fun and lively, the produce looks great, and the prepared food smells wonderful.  But I don't love it.  I'm actually somewhat annoyed by this store.  Numerous times I have entered looking for something and haven't been able to find it.  I know you're thinking it's some wierd gringa item I'm looking for, but this last time I was looking for canned tomatoes to make chili.  Canned tomatoes!?!?!  I'll cut them a little slack because I actually sent the husband to do the dirty work and he couldn't find it after asking 2 or 3 employees.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they do actually have it there, because it would be ridiculous for a Mexican market to not have canned tomatoes.  Another time I took an out-of-town friend.  He was so enamored with the beauty of the bakery items that he wanted to photograph the many cakes and pastries.  But the tub-o-security rolled over and said \"No Photographs!\"  Seriously?  These people work so hard to make such beautiful creations and we can't take pictures?  Of food?  (Ironically, the next day we went to Taliesin West and were encouraged to take photographs of everything except the gift shop.)  And, we left empty handed because the store didn't have 2 of the ingredients we needed.  Bottom line:  If I'm incredibly unspecific with the ingredients I am looking for, I can definitely do some grocery shopping here.  But any ideas for meals are usually thwarted and I end up at Safeway.",

My favorite is the shrimp taco sold in the back of the market at the pescaderia (even though it takes them forever to make) and a large cup of watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberry or horchata agua fresca. It's the perfect meal before a Suns or Diamondbacks game and a hell of a lot cheaper too!   The produce also seems to be alot cheaper than what I normally see at Fry's & Safeway.

I'm also not in the other camp who complain excessively about \"authenticity\". I lived in Guanajuato for three years, so I know at least a tad about the real stuff. And this is an Americanized market -- there are no questions about this, or there shouldn't be, at least. But on the other hand, I don't care. It's nice. We're in America, so let's appease the whities.  Yeah, it's nice. I like this place. I usually always smile at some point in here, but I also frown from time to time.

It's a great spot to grab a cheap lunch. They are usually busy, so allow yourself 10-15 minutes between ordering and actually eating.  Their Agua Frescos are delicious. I recommend the Melon. It's sweetened Cantaloupe puree, served on ice. There are little melon chunkies, small enough to slurp through a straw.  Of all the food I've had there, it was good. Carnitas, carne asada gorditas, etc.  So if you want to immerse yourself in good food and some lively people take a drive down to Ranch Market....",

You can also eat there, which we happily did. At the deli, we had a ceviche tostada and a fish taco for $4. The ceviche was delicious, although the fish in the taco wasn't cooked through.  Then we walked by the bigger, better food counter & couldn't resist the tacos there, which were fabulous.  Only demerits here are for sloppy, haphazard service & the undercooked fish taco.  A great place...",

Sometimes on my way home from work I will get the carnitas dinner for 2-3 people, and it literally feeds my boyfriend and I for a couple days.  For less than $10 you get a healthy bag of freshly cooked carnitas, homemade tortillas, salsa, beans and rice.  I usually buy a big bag of Michael's chips (they are saltier than Rick's) and a 1/2 pint of pico de gallo to take with me as well.  I am always impressed with the produce at Ranchie (that is what I call it for short).  I love using key limes for margaritas at home, but they can get pricey...not at Ranchie!    I am the envy of all of my out-of-state friends.  Any time they come to the desert for a visit, I take them there!",

I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.    Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.",

When you enter through the sliding doors for the first or thousandth time, you immediately understand what Ali Baba must have felt when he uttered, \"Open O Simsim\". For if you've entered through my favorite entrance (the West entrance), you'll be flanked by rows of 7' glass pillars filled with bejeweled pastries for sale.  The experience only gets better from there. Truly, Ranch Market is more of a destination for me and less of a stop. Highlights for me, include but are not limited to:  - having a smoothie made for you from fresh fruit and vegetables that are both peeled and pureed for you   - a produce area that reminds you of that great farmers market where the wooden carts are pilled high with produce so fresh you can feel the earth still holding on to the vegetables  - fans dancing throughout the store with streamers hanging from their blades  - a cafateria style food service area that rivals most modern mexican restaraunts  - ceviche that both tastes like the ocean and smells like limes hanging on tree   -",

    "text": "Whenever the husband and I are feeling lazy or have East Coast visitors, we venture to the voyeuristic picnic that is Ranch Market.    First, go to the \"Meat\" section:  For $9.99 (at post time), you can get a pound of flavorful, piping hot carnitas (pork), 18 corn tortillas so hot off the press they sweat in the bag, an order of beans, rice and salsa.  We're not really huge fans of the beans (too runny) or rice (sorta sweet and bland, has corn bits) and I usually pass on those in lieu of a nod-nod wink-wink extra side of meat (doesn't always work but it's worth a shot).  This is usually enough for 4 (if you want leftovers, get 2 lbs.)  Not fine on swine? Pollo (chicken) or carne (steak) asada is also the same price.    Then, go to the \"Dairy\" section for some queso fresco or cotija- whatever you fancy to sprinkle on top.      To drink?  A variety of Aqua frescas- horchata, watermelon, mango, pineapple...those Yankees won't know what him 'em.   Dessert? Tres leches cake, duh.  I haven't tried the ice cream but I'm sure it's delicious.  The pan dulce is a little dry if you're not careful.    Add your own homemade salad or roasted veggies to the table (to make Jamie Oliver happy).    Voila, dinner is served.    Have leftovers? scramble that tasty little pork into some eggs and wrap it up in tortillas with all your fixings to make your coworkers jealous as they slop up their microwave oatmeal (works every time)",

Buy a little cheese, an onion, and some sour cream and you've got yourself a little taco bar to take home and eat with some Dos Equis.  Sweet!  Since I'm all about the bargains these days, this is one of the best places to go!  A definite five stars as far as I'm concerned!",

Seek out the products that are made here. They're cheaper and better!  They make their own tortillas here, which are inexpensive and fresh. You can literally watch them be made, packaged up, and placed on the shelf. The salsas that are made here are also delicious and taste homemade. The food in the restaurant part of the store has been nothing short of delicious in my opinion. If you don't speak Spanish however, there may be a slight language barrier during the ordering process, especially if you have modifications or special requests. Touch-up on your numbers because your order will be called out in Spanish via loud-speaker.   The aguas frescas taste great and are cheap. I love tamarindo and papaya. Yes, there are going to be small bits in the drink - it's made from real fruit. If you can't handle that, they do sell Capri Sun juice boxes, too.   All in all, the \"authenticity\" of this place isn't what should be in question. I think it is rather authentic. It's a Latin-oriented chain supermarket run by people who know about the products that community seeks. And that's exactly what it says it is, right?  Highlight: Live music in the aisle!",

The entire store is lined with a bakery, a juice bar, a giant bar of all the Mexican foods you can eat, a cheese store, a sausage place, a tortilleria, a fresh fish market where you can get seafood tacos and ceviche and a carniceria.   While other are shopping, I'm busy eating and so are other people! There are clean tables inside the super market for you to get your food, cafeteria-style, and sit down to eat. There is a full bar of salsa and toppings near by. And if you want more food... go for it!  If you prefer a sit-down, they have a restaurant attached La Tradiciones that is also fantabulous! I hear they have a brunch that while is pricey, is worth the dolla dolla bills ya'll!",

I hate getting in the car for anything, and Phoenix Ranch Market is worth the 30 mile drive. I knew I was in for a treat just after getting out of the car - mexican party music piped into the parking lot & super bright displays visible through the doors. My boyfriend & I went up and down every aisle grabbing fun products to make awesome meals at home - masa, cast iron tortilla press, various mexican cheeses like asadero & oaxaca, fresh chips, fresh butter tortillas, real sugar pepsi & coke bottles, dried chillies, dried herbs (mexican oregano & cinnamon), nectars & coconut water to use as margarita mixers, etc. There is an entire cheese deli devoted to various kinds of cotija cheese (there had to be at least 10 different kinds). You can buy every kind of fresh tortilla your mind can think of, even whole wheat. There is a fresh fruit & salsa bar where you can buy stuff priced insanely low by the pound ($1.50/pound of fresh fruit?unreal!). There is an agua fruit bar with 10 different kinds - the coconut is to die for (and makes awesome margaritas!).   I love this place.",

We got there in the morning and were greeted with Mexican music played over loud speakers in the parking lot as we head for the entrance.  We walk into the store and immediately enter someplace we have never seen before.  There is a bakery featuring pastries, breads, and sweets which we have never heard of before but look so delicious.  Next we enter the \"la Cochina\", a food court that features all kinds of Mexican dishes and rows of picnic table benches.  Our tummy's rumbling so we decide to order the breakfast special \"chilaquiles\", its kinda like a breakfast nachos and sooooo delicious.  We also order juice from the nearby stand,  I had the \"jamaica agua fresca\", don't know what it really is but it was wonderful. (someone told me later it was hibiscus flower juice).  After eating we explore the produce section, and I can't believe that produce is so cheap in the U.S.  There are many things that I have never seen such as cactus pear (still don't know what people do with it).  We wander through the store soaking up the sounds, and sights in unmitigated joy, until we come to the seafood section.  Here we find out you can order fish or shrimp tacos, or ceviche tostadas.  Already full, we decide maybe we can try just a little more and order the ceviche tostadas.  And we were glad we did.  It was absolutely wonderful.  We continue through the rest of the store, and head out thinking that if we did nothing else in the U.S. on this trip, just visiting Pros Ranch Market was worth a 7000 mile flight.",

You will not cooperate with your list once you've walked through the entry to the glorious Ranch Market.   Do also go when you have the time to enjoy the market as it is always bustling and the check out lines can take a while.   I almost always walk out of RM with some fresh pico, and other salsas depending on my mood, and some fresh chips to go with that. I then usually wander until I come up with some Mexican meal I want to make and go at it.   Pricing is great as you can find prices similar to a Food City or Walmart. All fair and same good stuff.   Only knock I have is the food they serve inside RM at the food bar, while deliicous smelling, and also well priced, has not always been high quality. So I skip the food bar, and drop my good grocery money on the fresh made items and other ingredients necessary for a yummy mexican meal.",

So they require you to go through the cashier lanes to get out. This would be okay if it wasn't for the fact that the lanes are so narrow that it's impossible for a power wheelchair to fit through. The result being that I was trapped inside until someone pushed the gates open for me to get out. Needless to say, this is dangerous and perhaps illegal.",

I definitely recommend trying out their agua de fresca - I love the horchata and jamaica! The horchata is a little too sweet, but it's still so, so good.  And all the staff is really friendly; I especially like the gentleman that makes the fresh juice!  I've purchased some produce here, but I've never really shopped here.  The prices all seem reasonable though!  Parking is never an issue. There's a HUGE parking lot.  I'd rate this place higher, but I've seen a cockroach or two at this location... Both near the baked goods area.  And when you see one cockroach, you know there's definitely many others out there.  Just something to keep an eye out for!",

Try the Pollo Asada whole chicken meal for $6.99 ($5.99 on Wend/Thur) which comes with (8) fresh corn tortillas and salsa.  This chicken meal deal will hit you right in the taste buds and could easily feed 2-3 people in the process.

They sell numerous options of freshly squeezed/prepared juices and drinks (oh yeah, they have horchata!), then go to the counter for some made-to-order authentic Mexican fair:  Amazing tacos, awesome tamales (pick the pork over the chicken), crispy tortilla chips, flavorful sauces (their red enchilada sauce is pure perfection), and an endless list of other tasty foods.  All of their tacos come with fresh tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and limes (my taco plate had enough wedges to make two whole limes).  They even serve whole, fried Snapper in a combo for only $8.  Be warned, when I say \"whole,\" I'm saying that it comes with the head.  Something that makes my mom squeamish, but it is the only way I'll order Snapper.  Then again, I ordered Tripe as one of my options for tacos.  When your finished with lunch, you can then shop for supper because Los Altos Ranch Market is more of a grocer than an actual restaurant.  They have all the organic veggies you'll need for pocket change.  The meat/fish department is impressive without being snooty.  Before you leave, make sure you grab some of their fresh, in-store prepared corn tortillas, tortilla chips, and enchilada sauce.  They have other freshly made dips that, judging from the enchilada sauce, would be a great addition to any meal or snack.",

On weekends, it's all but impossible to move. I went there recently on a Tuesday afternoon  and it was still crowded. My husband and I always get the pork ribs and the carnitas. They're fattier than my doctor would like, but that's undoubtedly why they're so very good. We've also had the rotisserie chicken. Really, really tasty. I love that corn tortillas come with. I'm allergic to wheat, so it's a treat to be able to have these. Also worth a try: the rice pudding and seasonal fruit with sweet cream.",

One of the workers was in a rush to clock out and started mumbling things under his breath as he was helping us. It really sucks that us as a paying customer had to deal with that type of customer service, not to mention we asked to speak to the manager and manager took they're sweet time to come out and speak to us. We ended up leaving after waiting more than 20 mins to speak with her about the situation, and we spoke to the cashier to relate the message to their manager (different helper then the One mumbling things) The cashier rolled her eyes and said yeah OK I didn't apologize for the worst customer service ever. I will make sure I never go back to this ranch market and they don't receive any type of my business",

If your on a diet and looking for something on the healthier side. Then, they also have a juice bar where they blend a variety of veggies and fruits together that make a AWESOME drink that makes you feel great!

In the back on the left there is a large area with picnic tables and you can order delicious street tacos, chile relleno, tamales, etc. The biggest pork rinds you'll ever see are sold here! It's all awesome. We got a few combo plates with the mini street tacos & made our own nachos. All the food is affordable & authentic!  Next to the taco area is the juice area. You can get horchata, limeade, Jamaica, papaya, mango, etc., pre-made but fresh and tasty! The best are vampiros that they can juice fresh for you; beets, carrots, apples & pineapple super delicious!   Check out every aisle and stop by the amazing bakery, seafood department, butcher & the incredible cheese counter! Pick up their fresh homemade tortillas too!  I suggest to purchase the green salsa made with fresh roasted chili peppers & the Green chili sour cream is outstanding - adds the perfect touch of heat to just about anything you'll eat!",

    "text": "Who knew a little restaurant inside a grocery store would be so good.  Los Altos Ranch Market is a great everyday low price supermarket. Los Altos  is  like every modern supermarket that offers full service meat department, pharmacy items, baked sweets, picnic supplies and a full line of groceries.   However,  what the other markets cant offer and Los Altos can is a quality line of authentic mexican foods. Los Altos is where I go to get my homemade tortillas, tortilla chips, and fresh made salsas.       As soon as you walk through the doors of Los Altos you know this is not the  normal grocery store.  You  feel like you entered a new world.  There is  mexican music playing through out the store, smells of mexican food, mexican baked goods, and authentic Agua Fresca in large glass jars.   Tucked in the corner of Los Altos, is a huge tortilla-making machine. The smell of fresh tortilla in the morning draws you in and you can't avoid the temptation to purchase a few dozen fresh and hot off the press.   The food is excellent. Everything is reasonably priced & the portions are big enough that you will take home leftovers. I had a breakfast burrito for just $3.49, and it was big!  I have aslo had their pollo asado deal which included a full grilled chicken, rice, beans, salsa and 20 corn tortillas and it was also delicious.  You should stop by if your in the neighborhood",

There are so many options for breakfast and lunch here! It feels like a full scale restaurant. There are also fresh drinks available, so that's a plus. The line can get pretty long around lunch time, so I'd suggest coming a little earlier or later the lunch rush hour if you don't want to wait too long.  For grocery shopping, there are affordable prices, especially with the meat. They have daily specials, which is usually advertised with a sign outside the supermarket.",

Unfortunately they are mainly around the center of Phoenix and to put it lightly the parking lots can be a little sketchy (I always worry about our car in the parking lot).   Once you get inside the grocery store it is so much fun! For that, it is worth the drive and the visit. They offer produce and ingredients a lot of the other grocery stores do not carry and for fractions of the price. If you need avocados, tomatillos or limes, this is the place to go.   Their mexican style cheeses are really reasonably priced and the choices of tortillas and corn tacos are incredible. Their house made salsas especially the verde are delicious and their agua de fresca offerings will have you in awe. There are also about a dozen choices for crema, that you can find no where else.   You will have a hard time leaving this store in under an hour, because there is so much to discover.",

She doesn't know that one of our friends who we love dearly was born and raised in Mexico, or that we travel extensively and respect other cultures, or that it makes me sick to think of young adults brought here as children being sent to a country they don't know or was never their home. She just sees me as not from her culture, and is going to send a message to me and punish me because of my skin color. Ok, so there you have it.

That call ended with the good news that they would be switching back to the authentic mexicana feel. Thank Dios.

    "text": "So...I was headed down to the Cardinals vs Diamondbacks game and needed a place to grab a quick dinner.  I was craving some tacos and the reviews of this market looked pretty promising.  I drove down, parked and walked in the market.  I made my way over to the restaurant portion of the store and placed my order.  I went with the 5 taco platter for $6.99.  I went with 3 carne asada tacos and 2 adobada tacos.  That and a Mexican Coke came out to $9.75.  Here is how they were.........  Carne Asada Tacos-  First off, the tortillas they use were fantastic!  They were made there in house, and then grilled and crisped up a bit on the grill.  They were just a tad crisp (reminded me of Tacos Fitos in Tijuana) but had a great chew and were absolutely delicious.  Probably the best corn tortillas I have had in Phoenix.  The carne asada had a great flavor, but it was a little bit dry.  They keep the meats in a metal warming tray, and even though it was hot, that method of storage may have dried it out just a bit.  They were good, but not great.  The tortillas were definitely the star of the show.  Adobada Tacos-  Same great tortillas, same issue with the meat.  The adobada was not as dry, but still seemed like it might have been sitting for a bit too long.  It definitely wasn't cut off the spit right then and there.  The flavors were good though.  Once again, the tortilla was the star of the show.  Mexican Coke- Always good!  Service was snail slow.  There were a few ladies in front of me ordering stuff, and then a few guys behind the counter sort of just sitting there.  Eventually they asked if I needed some help, and made my tacos.  After that, there is only one cashier, and she was incredibly slow.  There were people coming into line from all over the place and there was not really an organized process of ringing up the next person in line.  With that said, my tacos sat on the counter for about 5 minutes before I got to eat them.    Overall, it was alright.  Decent meat, great tortillas.  If I was around the neighborhood and craving tacos, I would come back.  I don't think I would drive all the way down here from Surprise for just the tacos though.",

    "text": "This place kills two birds with one stone. I can do grocery shopping and eat delicious food all in one stop. The small street tacos are simple, yet crazy good. The tacos were topped with cilantro & onions. All the meats were well-marinated and flavorful. You can choose from carnitas, pollo, al pastor, carne asada, and tripas. Salsa was provided. I ordered the 5 taco platter with carne asada and al pastor for only $6.99!  You can also order 1 taco for $1.79, or do the 3 taco combo with rice & beans for $6.99. The workers were super friendly. They even let me sample the different meats prior to ordering.  I might have them cater my next major party because the food definitely stood out.   I love the aquas frescas here. The displays were adorable, demonstrating what ingredients were in each drink.  This weekend, they had Jamaica, horchata, guayaba, limonada con chia, fruta mix, and tamarindo aquas frescas. I had both the fruta mix and horchata, which were mixed to perfection. The aquas frescas were not too sweet, and were so refreshingly cool on this hot day. You can sample the drinks prior to purchase as well.   The produce section of the market is the best! This is my new favorite place for fresh and cheap fruits and vegetables. The prices are lower than my usual Fry's food stop. Chicken legs were as low as $0.88 per pound. We bought some pre-marinated chicken for such a bargain. I'm all stocked up for the week. To top it off, they have freshly baked pan dulce, and a lot more baked goodies.",

We asked to talk to the manager to confirm hours of meat shop waited over 10 minutes cashier attempted to call co worker to help her out and he said no nodding his head. She did her best and walked over to a other employee to have her get the manager once again.

I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur of mexican food (I like a lot of the places here in Phoenix and Scottsdale...a by-product of being raised where everybody thinks Taco Bell and Taco Time are \"mexican food\"), but I know what I like and Ranch Market's cafe is terrific!! I met a couple of friends here for lunch today, and was, as always, happy and full when I left. I had tameles today (my touchstone for the best in mexican food)...they were great...hot, soft, perfectly spicy, with the sauce ( I do believe I am getting aroused!  OK back to business. I have had burritos, various tacos, the hot dogs (nogales style), the sopa's and you know what? They are all really tasty and the people at Ranch Market are really nice. The prices are cheap (esp. when you compare the prices to some of the pricier mexican restaurants that, frankly, don't measure up, taste-wise and quality-wise to this cafe). Lastly, I could make a meal of their chips and salsa, fresh made, warm, spicy...I'm getting hot again. Go to Ranch Market, enjoy that cafe, you'll be glad you did!",

    "text": "I love this place. Best Horchata in Phoenix (you have to get it early though because they keep it cold with ice so by late in the day it is slightly watered down and the ideal heterogeneous concentration is lost). The food court inside is amazing. I have been there more times than you and have never had a problem with any of the food or staff. Sometimes communication can be difficult when ordering but if you know exactly what you want (like me) or unless you are fluent in Spanish (which I am not) there should be no problem, so no lallygagging around and no special orders.   The constant excitement added with a little bit of the English vs. Spanish war gives you the warmth and feel of a truly authentic Phoenix super market food court (I am sure there is some special name for it in the Hispanic culture, or at least something that sounds cooler than food court). I am fortunate that within my lifetime to have lived within a 5 minute drive of the Ranch Market, and I miss it dearly.  I know there are a lot of grocery stores called \"Ranch Market\" throughout the Valley, but when you live anywhere near this one it is the ONLY Ranch Market you will acknowledge. Go there, get a 1/2 pound of carnitas from the cooked meat section, it comes with corn tortillas and some green salsa/sauce/concoction that goes with it great. Don't forget the beans and rice. Salsa bar is on the left on the way out.   The prices are great. Best bang for your buck in this town.",

The only issue is that when I come home with a trunk full of fresh fruit and veggies that cost me $8 I slowly realize I have to actually store and eventually eat all of the produce I just bought. I hear Thursdays are the days to buy meat for cheap--but my fridge is usually busting with pineapple and strawberries by that point and there isn't room for an ounce of carne asada.  long story short, be prepared to weave through the masses on Wednesday mornings for some great finds. The rest of the market is fabulous as well. The \"Tradiciones\" restaurant serves excellent--and cheap (shocker) authentic Mexican food. Plus they also have an aisle with cooking supplies (like giant blue pots, tortilla presses, molinillos etc) and a whole wall of spices.  enjoy:)",

Like any good market the wide variety and abundance of fresh food at PRM makes shopping at the old chain store a boring old chore. The operative words here are fun, vibrant, and cheap. I went on a Sunday so I kicked it off with a steaming bowl of menudo, a beef tripe soup with a ton of garnishes so you can personalize your bowl. After I finished I wandered around filling up on fresh tortillas, dried and fresh chiles(my mole can beat up your mole anyday), my eyes were agog as I absorbed the sight sounds and smells of the bustling market. My favorite area was the meat counter where patrons bickered with the butcher over the best cuts and a peeled cows head stared blankly at me.  I swear I saw that thing blink at me.  Anyway a great place to visit if your in the mood for a tongue torta and some mariachi music.",

PRM is full of all kinds of Mexican/Latin goodies, from agua frescas to baked goods, prepared meals like tacos and ceviches to groceries and a wide selection of specialty produce. If you decide to dine here, the shrimp ceviche tostada is great. I also really enjoyed the quesadilla...so good 'n' buttery! The watermelon agua fresca was very refreshing, but my advice with all agua frescas would be to stick with the small size because, at least in my opinion, you get a little sick of the sweetness and the same flavor after a while.",

The sights, the smells, the lights, the colors, and the chaos had my head whipping back and forth all evening.   We started off with dinner in the cafe inside the market - just $5.99 for 3 street tacos, beans, and rice - and it totally filled me up. I washed it down with a Mexican coke in a glass bottle and it took me back to my childhood to the days before corn syrup became the norm.   After eating, we took our time perusing the aisles and examining the foods foreign to us. They have a beautiful produce department and the prices were great on both the more exotic items like fresh papaya's to the staples like tomatoes and lettuce.   The meat department is a carnivore's dream come True. Loads of fresh ground beef, pork, and poultry at very fair prices. I had to laugh at the ground pork in the glass case and wish I'd brought my camera. The butcher shaped it into a pig head - complete with a snout - and put cucumber slices for eyes. Not something I'd expect to see at my local gringo Fry's.  Shopping here was a real cultural experience tonight and I can't wait to tuck into the treats we brought home!",

We were in the mood for carne asada tacos to grill at home and decided to buy some meat here instead of food city or the carneceria up the street. I heard about the hype and great reviews but never got around to checking it out.   This place rocks! 100% authentic and has everything I need to make virtually any Mexican dish I can remember.   The place is so cool. I can't get over it. Bakery, deli, tortilla factory, cheeses, meats, seafood, veggies, spices and candy. It has it all. It's pretty much the Mexican version of Lee Lee's, only cooler looking and more fun.   Check it out.",

There also is a restaurant on site!",

I went to Ranch Market for the first time and it struck me as a fantastic experience - far different from Bashas and Safeway! - I wanted to browse each aisle and explore (and I am NOT a shopper!!).  I was looking for one thing in particular - Mexican Hominy for Posole - which they had several options on - but I walked out with a full cart of groceries.  I am planning to return periodically and expand my shopping (and cooking) repertoire!!  Muy bueno del Ranch Market, gracias!",

Not only were my new Mexican friends staring at me because I was the only white gal in sight, but probably because I was beaming from ear to ear!  From the outrageous meat section to the beautiful bakery I think I could easily spend a whole day there.

Typically, I go to Phoenix Ranch Market to pick up Mexican foods. I LOVE TACOS (and wouldn't mind receiving recommendations on the best place to get them)!!!  The prepared food in the cafeteria is enticing, but I have not had the chance to eat any yet.  However, the tortillas are very cheap and tasty (some made in house, I believe).  Additionally, the salsa bar is excellent, with approximately 6 types of salsas available for bulk packaging.  As mentioned above, I do not typically purchase meats or greens here.  They have a large selection of meat, but the butcher area is generally a mad house and a lot of the meats do not look particularly great.  The veggies and fruit are hit or miss, but the greens tend to be quite old and do not look good.",

    "text": "When I want to feel REALLY white, I just roll on down to Ranch Market to confirm my suspicions that, yes, I am in fact not as Hispanic as I think I am.  This store is what Food City WISHES it was!  It takes the best of Mexican specialty stores and eateries and combines it all under one roof.  Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.  Holy crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.  I've been going to Ranch Market for about 10 years at their stores in Bakersfield -- where they first started.  I used to make fun of my mom for going to lunch here.  Heh, look who's laughing now.  I'm addicted!  The food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas.   And the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.  Best of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.  Mariachis and bands abound here during the weekend.   Dang!!   Fry's, Safeway, Basha's - take note, por favor.  You're on notice.",

    "text": "TRAVEL ALERT/ALERTE DE VIAJE: The State Department wants you to know about new travel restrictions for entering and exiting countries subject to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiatve, including Mexico. As of June 1, 2009 travelers must possess either a passport, passport card, or WHTI-compliant identification to enter the US by air, land or sea. Contrary to popular belief however, Americans will be able to visit the Phoenix Ranch Market without documentation.  GENERAL DESCRIPTION/DESCRIPCION GENERAL: Phoenix Ranch Market III is an upmarket Mexican-style mercado complete with an interior food court called \"La Cocina\" (The Kitchen). It is located in a rather unpleasant part of town, but manages to attract a large following of gringos eager to inject some diversity into their palette without risking turista.  THE FOOD/LA ALIMENTACIN: Offerings in \"La Cocina\" run the gamut from Mexican style tortas, to more iconic tacos and burritos. Many items offer a choice of meat, from ham to carne asada, to carnitas. A separate area offers various seafood dishes. Everything is ala carte, suprising those hoping to economize using an American style \"combo\".  Despite this, \"La Cocina\" remains popular, especially at lunch time.  SERVICE/SERVICIO: All orders are taken by an attendant standing next to the line for the cashier. Most guests do not wait long before placing the order. Some have reported difficulty communicating with the attendant however, the other employees tend to have command of the English language. Visitors are responsible for retrieving their own orders and seating themselves at long bench-style tables.   PRICES/PRCIOS: Like Mexico itself, the Ranch Market is not the bargain it is made out to be. Prices that may look low for entrees quickly increase when adding in the cost of beverages, churros, and gas. Most respondents however, believe that the mercado occupies an important niche between True fast food and more sophisticated self-serve meals.   SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS/CONSIDERACIONES ESPECIAL: Some have accused the Phoenix Ranch Market from being too acommodating to non-Latino customers. While this concern cannot be dismissed, it is obviously the case that all of Mexico has fallen to this trend. New hotels now gleam along the shoreline in Puerto Penasco, golf courses spourt in the arid desert outside Cabo San Lucas, all while Costcos can be found in such tourist-heavy states as Veracruz and Guanajuato. The Calderon Government and America's Hispanics will have to confront the tension between assimilation and authenticity one agua fresca at a time.",

    "text": "I don't want to be controversial, but most of these crowning reviews are from those not likely to have seen what a True mercado may look like, and yes, I'm referring to ethnicity.    Phoenix Ranch Market is the Knot's Berry Farm to Mercado Tipico's Disneyland.  Its a noble effort to bring Mexican staples and unconventionals to the big city in the middle of Arizona, USA, but the product are tinged with americanization; from their weekend menudo, which is wholly rubbish, to the carne which is a grade above what you would get in a True Mexican market (damn FDA).  Though the latter may sound like an unusual gripe, its that stringy gato-grade-meat that makes fajitas and tortas uniquely tasty.  I was impressed one time, however, when my buddy Graham snagged a few pounds of fajita meat for the SuperBowl from PHX RM, and they marinaded it for him in a sturdy plastic bag which included whole jalapenos to boot.  However, I beleive it was Graham's skill on the grill that made them very tasty and moist rather than any particularly amazing grade of meat from the Market.  As a hispanic, the place feels appreciably disingenuous.  Sure, they sell the liquados and the pansitos, et al, but if you plopped this place in Mexico pt 1, it would fail from poor quality by Mexican standards.    By all means, if you don't know the difference, then knock it out.  You won't know what you are missing anyway, and you can get your ethnic dinner party needs and a sandia drink while you wait.",

    "text": "Phoenix Ranch Market III is an absolute MUST for any person visiting Phoenix, Az. Forget the upscale breakfast and faux southwest shops that dot and line Scottsdale. Forget the 'burbs of Peoria, Goodyear, and East Mesa. Don't let your visiting family leave without making a trip down to the Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th st and Roosevelt. Yes, this is south of the I-10 freeway and far away from your faux mexican food at Macayo's Cantina. At Phoenix Ranch Market you'll find a side of the city that nearly all of the transplanted surburban population seems to want to ignore, or just completely forget. This is Phoenix being Phoenix, not Phoenix trying to be a new Los Angeles or anyplace else.  After having breakfast at a carbon copy brunch eggery, I was in need of something less perfect and faux. I found exactly what I was craving. When you can hear the sounds of mariachi or radio campesina from your car parked at the other end of a packed lot, you know this isn't the local Kroger you're about to enter.  Part grocery store, part food court, part village market, PRM is huge, it's overwhelming and it's surprisingly clean and comfortable - this isn't a low rent grocery like Food City. With a fresh seafood section two or three times the size you'd find anywhere else in Phoenix, and with parts of animals you've probably never prepared at home, it's fun to just look, but even more fun to buy. Want meat? Want better options? Better cuts? Want an entire skinned cow's head with the eyes intact and staring at you? Check. It's all SO GOOD.  But that's just the meats. They make their own tortillas onsite with a literal factory and small army of workers churning out the flat corn and flour awesomeness. Hungry? Want mexican food? Want great mexican food? ALWAYS consider going here. Think of anything on a restaurant menu and you have it here. Prepared fresh, and a la carte. Seriously. Tamales of any kind. Horchata! Cow Tongue! Burritos of immense size and stuffed with anything you want. Some of the best beans in town, rice, and parts from a pig that still actually look like parts from a pig. This isn't the mall food court.  The place is packed with mostly hispanic families but you'll also notice a few adventurous types, including my asian self. Most of the employees speak english very well so language is not a barrier. The only times you'll need help is when asking what is that? And like mentioned above, the answer just might be cow tongue (which by the way, is good, however I can see how the texture would turn some people off. Imagine a soft almost too mushy beef...)  Oh. The food is also cheap. You'll get more than full off of $5, you'll explode at $10. It's seriously like heaven here. Music, people, atmosphere, food, drinks, desserts, baked goods. All of it awesome. I met up with my friend Amy.The.Kidd for 'lunch' and we ended up spending almost 4 hours just walking around, back and forth, trying each new item we found, or trying the standards but knowing they were going to be better here. Mmmm. Horchata, great corn tamales, rice, beans, empanadas, warm fresh tortillas... bring everyone. This is a place that should be in people's minds when they think of Phoenix, not just the golf courses, or upscale Scottsdale, or Frat/Sorority Tempe... but South Phoenix. No matter how scary it is for suburban soccer moms to venture down there.  Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th St and Roosevelt. Take me anytime.",

EVERYTHING. Prices lower than Walmart, the largest selection of 89 cent pastries I've ever seen, several small \"restaurants\", full cows heads for only 49.99, a vast selection of specialty items most grocery stores don't carry much of (Hispanic stuff, fruits, vegetables), plus, it's probably the most clean grocery store I've ever been in.

    "text": "These markets are truly a fiesta. No joke! Incredibly bright and festive on the inside, always bustling with people grabbing groceries or some lunch. This is the best chain of Mexican grocery stores in Arizona hands down. The produce here is very inexpensive, and much fresher than what you could ever find at Food City. Part of that is because they're operated by people who actually care about the quality of food that they sell their customers.   But AZ grocery politics aside, this place totally rules. Being a native Californian, I always needed avocados in the house. While Safeway and other stores would sometimes charge an arm and a leg for mediocre avocados, I could almost always count on specials on great Haas' at Ranch Market. This is the best place to stock up on everything your kitchen needs to make traditional Mexican food. Their butchers have the cuts and items that most American stores don't carry (for those of you who are Menudo-minded) and they've got a killer hot deli counter (in the style of a cafeteria).   I've had countless lunches here. I highly recommend their pollo asado, which is grilled right in front of you. They've also got a little counter that sells helados (ice creams) and bebidas (drinks). The melon drink and their horchata are super refreshing. While I still prefer eating at La Tolteca, it's the Ranch Market that wins for actual groceries. And their killer panaderia, too!",

I am glad that I found this place b/c usually I have had to make lots of stops to pick up things in different places, I am Puerto Rican,(Hispanic from the Caribbean)  and we look for certain things that are not found in Food City, you can find them at LeeLee's but at higher prices, but here I found them all and at great prices!!!!!",

My wife's family is from Puerto Rico and I can find what I need to cook her home food here and hardly anywhere else in the city. They have everything you need for a hispanic feast or good ole barbecue!   I like to rummage through the meat department, try one of the probably 20 different types of crema, pick up some fresh tortillas and get vegetables I can't normally get elsewhere. All in all, this is one of my favorite shopping places in Phoenix.",

Priorities.  The place is vibrant with life that you don't get in any American-style grocery. It's a feast for the senses.   Don't expect fast or snappy service at the lunch counter. There's usually a line. Knowing Spanish helps a bit, but there's usually someone around who can translate. For your patience you will be rewarded with the real tastes of Mexico: The gristle of lengua, the insanely savory flavor of the carnitas, the wonderful aroma of the barbacoa.  Just go. Pick up some real tortillas and some Coke in real glass bottles too. It's still made with sugar, dontchaknow?",

It is nothing but a fun experience everytime I go.  They have a vast selection of food, a great source of produce, and the best food that has ever been served in a grocery store.   Sometimes, I go 15 miles out of my way, just to have some of their Carnitas tacos.  They are to die for!  Fresh meat, fresh tortillas, and a large selection of fabulous salsas makes for an incredibly delicious lunch.  Make sure you go over to the drink station and try some of their Horchata.  Horchata is a drink made out of almonds and rice... It is creamy and delicious.  If you are looking for something sweet, then go with their Hibiscus.  It will literally melt in your mouth.  Everyone who lives in Metro Phoenix needs to go to this place.  It's a True treat!",

    "text": "My roommate and I were throwing a party, and I was brave enough to decide to do a full Louisiana style shrimp boil. It's not shrimp season. :( The price per pound was more than I expected - and I realized that either a Hispanic or Asian market is the way to go for getting a good deal. Ranch Market had medium shrimp, shell and head on, in frozen 4 pound boxes. Perfect - as I was getting 20 pounds! The roommate and I headed down around noon on Saturday. We were both hungry, so decided to grab a bite before shopping. He had a bowl of posole and a quesadilla. I wanted the sopa - but they weren't offered that day, so opted for the taco salad with carne asada instead. Delicioso! I opted for a jamaica to wash it down - but now the watermelon agua fresca is calling to me! The dining area (lots of picnic tables) was clean. The salsa/condiment bar was fresh and well stocked. Every employee we dealt with was friendly and efficient. After filling our bellies, we got some produce (all was very fresh, well displayed and notably less expensive than the Fry's near the house), picked up the shrimp and headed out. I know I will be back for more specialty items, produce, meat and fish - and the bakery section! It's a bit far out of my way to do the regular weekly grocery shopping here - especially as we're getting into summer and I don't know I could get perishables home before they perish...but Ranch is hitting my rotation for sure!",

    "text": "I love this place!    The meat is always fresh and affordable.  The fish too.  The veggies often fresher and more affordable than at other grocery stores in the area.  This is the only place I buy my corn chips or tortillas.  This is also where I enjoy coming to get a quick Mexican food fix.  Just last night I picked up a whole chicken prepared Asado (think grilled/brick chicken) for $5 which included fresh corn tortillas and a generous portion of their Salsa Molcajete (my favorite here).   Now I can get a roasted chicken here too, and while priced equally to Costco or Safeway...neither give you the tortillas and salsa that make it a meal.  Other times I have picked up some ceviche at the fish counter, and for the price/lb they include avocado, tostadas and  extra limes. Again a full meal.  They will also fillet or fry up any whole fresh fish right there for you.   You can't forget your fresh pasteries, baked goods and cakes.  Or maybe just some Ice Cream or a large agua fresca in one of at least 6 flavors. Of course now that the fall is here they also serve up Mexican Hot Chocolate and Chompurado....  If you are in for a cultural experience stop in here.  Don't worry most people speak both English and Spanish.  I prefer to practice my Spanish when I stop in.",

I haven't eaten there but my roommate used to go all the time and grab food from the little cafeteria looking area. Highly recommended. Need to try the rotisserie chicken that you walk past on your way in one day. Also, look for the gigantic pig head over by the meat. Disgusting, but photo worthy.",

The price of a meal; super inexpensive. The deliciousness of that meal: out of this world!   The pastries are the next big thing that I look forward too when coming here. It's by far the biggest bakery I've seen with the largest, freshest variety of pastries.   The produce, though I've never bought any myself (others with me have), is very well priced and VERY delicious. My only advice when coming here; know a little Spanish, it helps (I'm still learning). But don't worry, the staff is super friendly and fun (and patient). :)",

I got a recommendation for Ranch Market from a friend who did a medical rotation through Scottsdale. Thanks, friend!  My family went to the food court and we ordered our dinners. Among our dishes, we had the pollo verde (spicy!), taco salad, chicken burrito w/ mole, and beef stew (I forget the Spanish!). Winners: beef stew and the chicken burrito w/ mole. Delicious.  We also had horchata along with our meal, and it was great!  Afterward, we went through the market buying fruits and drinks. They had a Mexican version of a Japanese yogurt drink (that we buy in Taiwan) called Yakult. mmm, yogurt drink!! Love this place!",

She was a sweet woman but, no, no gracias. Entering the store I was overcome by memories of shopping with my Tias, (aunts) in Mexico so long ago. What I saw made my mouth water. Ensaladas, platos de carne asada, chorizos, filetes de Talapia, pan dulce (sweet breads) oh! and the cheeses! The meat prices you cannot beat. Steaks so red fresh you could almost see a heart beat. I recently bought a roast at another market for about $15. Here at the Ranch a roast 2.5 times the size was only $3 more!!  This place is BUSY. But from what I saw everything looked clean and there were people ready to help me with whatever I needed. I really loved this place.",
