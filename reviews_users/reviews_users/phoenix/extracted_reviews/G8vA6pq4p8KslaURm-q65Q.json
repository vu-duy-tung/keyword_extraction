I order a chicken cutlet hero and the next thing you know is the guy is picking up some patties or round things and tossing it in the nuker on a paper towel (just like at home). I say something about it and he is like \"im just warming them up and then I'm gonna throw them down there\" Down there was another oven below the microwave.    Whatever he had planned for those chicken cutlets I wasn't about to find out and hoofed it out of the place. Maybe places do nuke their cutlets, but this time I'm watching and I'm not eating rubbery chicken and they should ashamed of themselves anyway.     Romanelli's - 35 years of microwaving food. Manja people.",

Their subs are tasty despite being a bit heavy on the bread side; and their chicken Parmesan is pretty good too. The service is quick and the speed at which they prepare the subs is lightning fast. The only downside is the prices, I mean they are not that cheap for their subs but if you get desert like cannoli then you're going to fork over an extra $3.00 per cannoli or $2.00 per cookie.. Oh well I will continue to come here and enjoy the food.",

If you pay by credit card they charge $1.50 on top of their pretty pricey items.  For a sandwich, drink and bag of chips to be $15.00 out the door - way too much.  The deli sandwich maker consistently forgets to put items on my subs.  I have to check two or three times to make sure every item I ask for gets on there.  This makes my sandwhich wrapping a mess!!!  I love their no frill Tuna Salad yet they don't always have it, you have to call ahead and make sure they are serving it that day, which makes spontaneous stopping by too premeditated for me.  Not a lot of great Delis in the North Vally area, i wish this one could have stayed as good as it has been for such a long time :(",

True right up front, it is in a rough hood. But, maybe you should just go during the day. The selection here in the Groceries is without comparison.  They have everything Italian you could want.....Imported from Italy. Of course. They make their own sausage there,(you can buy it in the meat case.)  It is by far, THE BEST we have ever had any where. It even drove the dog crazy when I just brought it in the house. The smell is so good!  The choices for the food and cook ware,as well as gifts are fantastic.  I have not been able to eat lunch there but ,next time we will. So far the first 3 times have just been Grocery shopping. I live just over 50 miles round trip from this Deli , Bakery. Every mile is worth it. I cannot believe I had never been here till October. I have since recommended it to every Italian I know. Oh yes, it is that good. If I could give them 10 stars ,I would.",

Besides the food being absolutely amazing, the owner, Sam, came over and asked if he could sit with us.  He has owned and run this establishment with his family for over 36 years and takes great pride in the food and service they provide to their customers.  He is one of the most endearing and lovely people we have met.  The market offers a wonderful variety of Italian food, wine, and other great selections!

And accommodating. I ordered chicken parm sub. The chicken parm portion was pre made...awhile ago....as the breading had a glue like texture.  I also selected 1/3 lb of Italian butter cookies @12.99/lb. The cookies were stale and I'm gonna guess they sat in a freezer for a good long time, as they possessed a very strong freezer burnt flavor.  Lastly, I ordered a plain cannoli. The cannoli was pretty D. good. The ricotta cheese was blended to a very smooth texture...yum! While I waited for my sandwich to be made I did a lap in the store to check out the imports. I did note the freezer stock does not appear to move. Lots of items showing signs of age in the refrigerator/freezer case, like rusty sardine cans and frozen pastas that are dried, cracked and tired.  I found that leaving the product in place combined with the other things previously mentioned left me with a rather negative impression. I did take note of the dried meats and aged cheese's, there was a large selection of what I assumed to be imported items, maybe I will stop in and try some capi-lami-chutto sometime in the future.",

They also have a store area where you can buy specialty items like pasta.",

I was extremely disappointed when I saw Romanelli's idea of struffoli - ping-pong size balls of dough covered with sprinkles and a little honey on the bottom of the pan. The real thing is a huge mound of marble-sized dough balls drenched in honey and sprinkles. Please don't advertise what you're selling as struffoli. Google it and you'll find recipes that will show you the real thing. If I didn't have a tiny kitchen and no time, I would make them myself.",

The lady behind the counter greeted me right away and could sense my confusion on where to place an order and pointed me in the right direction.   I ordered the Robert special and then ended up taking a lasagna home. The sandwich was phenomenal. Everyone was friendly and helpful.  It was pretty busy and I heard someone yell they needed more cannolis in the front and someone behind the deli counter yell back they would bring them up. It was pretty funny just listening to the banter back and forth. There is a pretty impressive selection of grocery items and frozen pastas as well as novelty items. When I was checking out I asked about the cannolis and asked her if she was related to the guy at the deli counter. She explained it is a family owned business and she's been friends with the family since grade school. I was told the cannolis are made fresh every day and she had run out and that's why she was yelling for more to be made. I asked about placing larger orders and was provided a menu so I could see what my options were.   I would definitely go back again even though it's out of my way but I can stop on my way home from work.",

They have actual San Marzano Italian tomatoes and Stanislaus \"Alta Cucina\" California grown copy cat San Marzano style tomatoes. You can't get either just anywhere. They also have a selection of Pasta machines too! I love this store!  It's also the only place (I know of) in Phoenix to get sausage casings! I always get some Olives while I'm there because they're the best anywhere. I'm glad I got plenty of real, fresh mozerella mini balls. I planned to make a nice pasta salad with fresh Mozzarella, Basil & Cherry Tomatoes, except the Mozzarella was so good I ate it all!!!! LOL Now I have to go again! A+++++",

This is the first sandwitch I have had in 10 years that has great bread. Robert brought me out a meatball to try and it was great. The perfect mix of beef and pork with some breadcrumb and baked to perfection. My original intention for going here today was for the proper ingredients for dinner tonight. Found Nina brand tomatoes with basil and some fresh cheese ravioli. I drove nearly thirty minutes to eat and shop here and will be back many times. The retail section on its own is great with several olive oils and basalmics to choose from. The deli counter has the proper amounts of pancetta and fresh provisions. This place could be very costly if you go there hungry.",

Looked at the shirts, looked at the baked goods, then headed to the Deli Counter.  Saw a special on the glass.  any two different items 10.99.  I was not really interested in the meatball, lasangna, or Chicken Parm, just wanted some of their Italian Sausage.  So being it was 5:30 and they we closing in a few minutes I asked if I could get two of the sausages for the price of the special?  The very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem.  So I began to    order for my wife son and I.  Ok I will have 2 specials,  My wife would like the Chicken Parm and the Meatballs, My son even though he is only 6 wanted the meatballs and the Lasanga, no worries I ordered the Meatballs and the Lasanga, and lastly I will have two Italian sausage.  at that point the not so pleasant fat, Short, guy from behind the counter yells they have to be two different things, then turns to the lady and states cant you read, how long have you worked here?  i began to explain and he yells again this time at me, If you want two sausages they are 6.99 a piece or you c an buy the at 5.49 a pound a take them home and cook them yourself.  I stated that if I wanted to cook dinner  I would not have come in.  he then yelled if you want us to cook them you can pay for them?  this was our cue to leave.  the poor girl behind the counter said she was sorry and he began to yell at her again.  As we got in our truck the girl came out and waved as she knew us from many past visits.  The food is ok at best however my wife being Italian liked the nostalgic feel of the place.  Now because of the rude behavior of the little fat man we will not be returning,  After 15 years we will buy our Italian Sausage elsewhere.",

We enjoy this deli so much we are talking about taking a trip out there next Friday for lunch.We have visited half dozen times and have had only one issue with this nice little deli. The problem was not that big of a issue but did kind of tick me off. I had bought dinner rolls and when I got home pulled them out of the sack and they where hard as a rock.So always check for freshness before you buy anything from the bakery.There was one other little issue I had here when a gal working the front checkout counter was not pleased she had to work because she was not vary friendly at all and looked totally miserable.That was the only time I have seen her and hope I never do again, the main reason they did not get five stars from me. Other that that this place absolutely rocks dudes and is most definitely worth the 70mi trip.",

We also  had lunch.  The meatball hero was amazing plus the turkey, roast beef and cheese hero was stacked high with ingredients and reminded me of being back east.  The grocery store has some amazing Italian pastas, drinks from back east and other amazing stuff to make a great Italian dinner at home.  The pastries were very good, I did not like the cake frosting on the chocolate eclair but the custard was very good not to sweet and the napoleon tasted very good as well.  The cookies I thought were a little over price @ $11.00 a pound and you only get about 6-8 cookies for that price.  I say this is a mixed review because I tried the baked ziti also and it was very very dry, tasted like it was a day old and the pasta sauce was very very acidic.  It actually made me throw up.  I originally wanted to try their pasta because I was looking to have them cater an event but after trying the very dry pasta which made me throw up I decided to use another restaurant.  The sandwiches and pasties are amazing. Customer services rocks. I would not go out of my way to go here but if I was in the neighborhood I would stop in just for the sandwiches and a yoohoo.",

It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.    When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.  I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.  Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.  I only open they were open past 6pm.",

A woman was talking about being a transplant from Chicago, and the proprietor told her all about some of the products they sold that were specific from that area. I liked the atmosphere.  I liked the variety of products sold, especially the large selection of drinks and things like that. Pretty cool!  My only difficulty was getting out of the parking lot. Blah. I hate traffic, and this place is close to a busy intersection.   Other than that, no complaints!",

Was greeted immediately and escorted to the deli counter and given a terrific suggestion for a lunch sandwich.  I had the fresh mozzarella and prosciutto on a fresh baked Italian roll.  Probably the very best sandwich of my life!  On the way out I chose a $15 platter of Italian cookies to share with my colleagues and a cannoli (that one is all mine!).  Outstanding food and service all the way around.",

It was around noon when I went so I figured I might as well get some lunch as well. I got the super sub sandwich and it had a good portion of meat and cheese on it. I believe it came with ham, pepperoni, salami, and cappicola and all of them had really great flavor. I also tried a cannoli which I really enjoyed. The cannoli shell had great texture and the filling was very creamy. My girlfriend wanted to try the limoncello mascarpone cake which was super moist and had a really great lemon flavor. As we were picking out which desserts to choose from, one of the workers was very nice and helpful and she also shared with us one of her recipes. The customer service alone is a good enough reason to make a visit here. They make you feel welcome and very comfortable and you can tell that they love what they do. Lastly, after we finished our meal another worker was handing out samples of their Italian sausage which was spicy and had really awesome flavor. I will most definitely be coming back for other great Italian treats.",

Look for the DOP stamp (its like a region-control stamp on French wines).  Oh yeah, pick up some imported pasta in shapes you've never seen or some pizza dough and fresh basil (it's in the deli case by the meats) and make your own sauce. BAM!  Don't forget the Torrone (nougat candy) or some Italian Ice/Spumoni for dessert if you aren't a big pastry fan.",

I was immediately greeted by a beautiful display case of Italian cookies, which we (my husband and I) later went back and bought a pound of.  Then we followed our noses to the deli counter, where they had both hot food already prepared, as well as a menu of deli sandwiches. We decided to shop around a little bit first, since I wanted to buy a few items. We took our time wandering around the store, and after about 10 minutes on of the owners, Robert, came over to us to make sure we were okay. He then proceeded to take us around the store pointing out all the best ingredients and what I was looking for.  It was a delight! I stocked up on the basics like EVOO, balsamic vinegar, pasta, and bought my first can of San Marzanos. It was after the canned tomato aisle that my heart stopped. I literally turned around and almost peed my pants. I almost pee my pants just thinking about it. I spotted the pastry case, and contained within was a HUGE eclair that made my heart do a little flutter. So of course I HAD to get an eclair....and a cannoli and baklava. This was my first cannoli and will most definitely not be my last. YUM!!!!!!!  We then went back to the deli counter and ordered lunch. I had the Italian Stallion and my husband had the sausage and pepper sub. He was so impressed, that we ordered 2 links of sausage to take home with us!   Overall, this being my first time in an Italian deli and grocery, it was more of an experience than anything. The people were so friendly and helpful to the blonde girl from Phoenix. I clearly didn't know what I was doing but they have so much passion for their food and what they do, that they took the time to help educate me on Italian cooking and all the pleasure it brings. Even though it takes about 20 minutes to get here from my house, I will definitely be going back.",

He's from Chicago so he's a snob about Italian beef. His favorite in the valley so far. We were so impressed that we ordered the take home meal from Romanelli's for dinner. The dinner serves 2-3 people.  You can choose from baked ziti, spaghetti,  chicken parm. There is another option but I can't recall what it is.  We chose the chicken parm. The meal comes with a salad,garlic bread & spaghetti w meatballs.  $24.99 is reasonable for dinner. Spaghetti, meatballs & salad was perfect. Chicken parm  wasn't that great. The chicken seemed too thick & their was no flavor in the breading or chicken.  Oh well, I just won't' order the chicken parm next time. If you want  authentic Italian beef, tasty meatball sandwich, need a cannoli or want a large jar of hot peppers, Romanelli's is your place. Next on my list, pizza & cold sub's...",

It's only a few exits down the road from work and the reviews seemed pretty good!  I walked in and placed my order for a Meatball Sandwich.  (The going rate for a meatball sandwich in Phoenix is about $9.00-10.00).  Total was just under $10.00.  I paid my ticket at the register in the front of the store and then grabbed my sandwich. Here is how it was.........  Meatball Sandwich-  This was excellent!  They take a loaf of home made bread, slice it up right then and there, pile it with about 6-8 meatballs halves, top it with cheese and then pop it in the toaster oven!  The end product was great!  The bread was toasty, yet soft when you bit into it.  The meatballs had great texture and consistency, the cheese was melted perfectly, and the sauce/gravy they use is awesome!  It was a thicker sauce and was flavored perfect...not too sweet, and not bitter either. Overall, just a damn fine meatball sandwich!  Might be the best one I have had so far in Phoenix!  Overall, I was impressed!  The place is family owned and they have been open for over 40 years.  They have a deli counter as well as a whole little store with all sorts of Italian goodies (Sauces, bread, peppers, olives, cookies, etc). They have plenty of seating, too!  I will definitely be back to have another meatball sandwich and try out some of their cold subs as well.   Service was very friendly and while I was there, it seemed like lifelong, repeat customers kept coming in to grab something to eat.  Good stuff!",

    "text": "On the day I went here for lunch with a colleague, I talked about how sick of the city I was during the drive over.  Then we walked into this place at a strip mall and it felt like I was transported to a small town grocery store that could have been in my rural hometown back east or even in Italy.  The family establishment vibe permeated the entire trip.  The service was very friendly.  And the food is amazing.  I could eat lunch here every day. It is very difficult to choose what to order because it all looks so good.  I had the sandwich special of the day, and it was fabulous. My colleague shared her potato salad with me and It was the best I've ever had.  I would like to go back and shop for deli meat and sausages.   When we checked out, an older gentleman in front of us was moved to sing a song in Italian to the clerk after commenting on how the store reminded him of his youth.  My colleague got a bunch of cookies and treats to go.  They were consumed rapidly by our office mates upon our return.",

If this place isnt authentic than I don't know what is,  there were litterally Italian men sitting down have a causal chat in the restaurant.  We had a caprese salad and sub.  Both were absolutely over flowing with goodness. The Italian bread was a little hard for my taste so I would recommend a softer bread. Definitely need to go back to try their other dishes.

Initially when I walked it I was greeted with a smile and ask if I needed any help at all. The initial walk in is kind of overwhelming because there is items everywhere, they also have a deli in the back that I didn't notice until I got done walking down all the isles of great Italian products. I saw the meatball sub, now I absolutely hate meatball subs from anywhere I.e firehouse subs, cousins, subway, etc.. so I was hesitant, but I gave it a go and oh my god. This sub was absolutely amazing, I live pretty far from this location, but if I am ever craving a sub again I will certainly be coming back here. The bread was toasted to perfection, I don't like Mariana sauce but this was the best Mariana sauce I have ever had. The meatballs were great the cheese on top. Hands down the best meatball sub you can get in Phoenix. You can also get their lasagna and order it ahead of time before you come in. The cannolis are awesome as well, made to perfect and by hand scratch. I will never shop at any other deli I will be very strong supporter of this place!",

If you are looking for an Italian deli in Phoenix that has a wide variety of goods this is the spot.  You will pay much more here than you would if you went to the grocery store but you will not be getting the same authenticity.

Good sandwiches (try the George's special which is the Italian Stallion referenced by others plus a couple other meats including mortadella and hot peppers) or the pastrami that they get shipped direct from New York.  They have their own off site bakery, so try some of their breads (the ciabatta is especially good) or cookies: the butter cookies are a bit hit or miss, but the rainbow cookies that they keep in the back are nearly to eastern standards.  However, the real star of the show is the sausage that they grind daily, along with the selection of certain specialty items: 30 year old balsamic, San Marzano tomatos and Mancini peppers anyone?",

It's also a market, so, needless to say, I enjoy grabbing a quick bite in places that are a bit unconventional.. and, as I sat there eating, I looked at some italian antacids that kind of looked like screws or something that were bottled on the shelf next to me.. :/  Anyway, I also bought premade cannoli shells, which were a bit pricey, but to make my own it would have probably cost more..  AND they had the filling to purchase as well..  This was pretty neat to me.

Th ey also don't have the good crispy bread they use to have. How can panera have better bread than an Italian place? I was there last week and noticed some ordered pretty bake pizzas, so I bought a couple and they were pretty bad. Their  warm lunches are good, however way too expensive. If ya need sausage foe the bbq I would go, if you want lunch take a pass.",

I felt I was back in the Bronx. The smell once I entered the deli was unbelievable.  They say smell is one of the strongest senses we have that bring back memories.  Not only was it a deli but a store that you can buy Real Italian products. Then to top it off the store has a bakery. Then the best was Frankie singing our favorite hits. Doesn't get any better than that.",

From the outside, this place looks like a 60's-era thrift store-type building. You walk inside, and it's an actual Italian store, delicatessen, and eatery filled with all things Italian...from the food, to the clothing, knick-knacks, and souvenirs.   I ordered spaghetti and a medium-sized soda and my co-worker ordered the George, which was a 10' sub with all kinds of lunchmeats, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, also vinegar and oil and oregano. It looked and smelled wonderful! He got it as a combo with chips and a large drink.   When we went to pay at the register, my co-worker picked up a box of yummy Italian cookies of all types to take back to have for when we get \"sweet munchies\". All said and done, the lunch was about the price of your typical dinner entrees and dessert. Not too shabby.   The ambience of this place was really wonderful and the owners were very, very friendly and hospitable. This is a \"Mom & Pop\" business and one I would gladly visit and buy meals and goods from over and over. The shop is located in a small strip mall at the intersection of Dunlap and 35th Avenue in Phoenix.   I HIGHLY recommend this place when you are in the Phoenix area.",

My favorite is the George's Special - cured Italian meats and peppers. I always get the hard crust bread which is great with the oil dressing, bread gets soft not soggy. I've had several of their sandwiches and they are all amazing. The meatball sub is out of this world. I do wish they had a better selection of cold salads, but eh they are still better than anything you would get at a traditional grocery store. The napoleons are also amazing. Lots of custard.",

    "text": "If you are a fan of the Subway Chain or On- Cor Frozen Dinners this is the place for YOU!  My husband tried the recommended George's Special. It's almost an Italian Style Hoagie. The quality of the meats aren't as bad as Subway but it was pre-portioned and made possibly days in advance and is all old and squashed together. They apologized to us and said they didn't have their normal rolls. The roll they had when we were there was a squishy roll that fell apart. The sandwich was dressed with a not so tasty dressing.  But on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option.  They offer a sandwich of the day and also have a special board. The special of the day was Eggplant Rollatini. I thought that sounds good I'll try that. They all start running around and maybe five minutes later they tell me they are out of Eggplant Rollatini and my husband spots them pulling out from the freezer a big plastic frozen tray of them.   So I go for the Sandwich of the day. It was corned beef on a roll. I asked them to put it on rye instead because that would taste better. They asked me if I wanted it cold or warm and I answered warm please. The people working seemed very confused making my sandwich. They toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave. It was a very generous portion of corned beef but it was a mediocre quality. I tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed.  I saw chicken parmesan patties under a heat lamp and they looked like they were formed and processed just like those On-Cor Frozen Dinners that I remember from my childhood.  My husband purchased some of their house made Hot sausage. He cooked it as soon as we got home. He said it had a good flavor but it was unusually dry.  I would never come here again to eat anything but the store here is above average for an Italian Deli place.  1.5 Stars Rounded up for the store.",

    "text": "\" If you like my meatballs, you're gonna love my sausage.\"... they sell T-shirts and aprons with that saying on it. My point? It's a very fun and casual spot. The Italian grocery part of it is one of a kind in Phoenix. Whether you are looking for jars of sweet roasted peppers, Lupini beans, stuffed finger peppers, olive oil, wine or any other Italian delight, this is the place to come. The pastries are fresh and delicious here as well, if you love Italian cookies you got to try this place. I saved the best for last of course. THE DELI, they understand the simple fact that most people miss. Quality delicious food comes from quality delicious ingredients. They don't skimp here, not on the bread, the meat, the cheese or anything. My favorite sandwich is called \"Roberts's Special\", it's the perfect combination of roast beef, pastrami, provolone, tomato, mayo and onion, served hot. Add the hot or sweet giardiniera and you have the best sandwich around, in my humble opinion.",

Upon arriving there were no employees in the front the help me for almost 7 minutes I wandered around the store Hoping someone would come up to the counter. Finally someone assisted me and told me the price of the smaller tiramisu that they had. The employee gave me the price of 28.99. I left the store without the tiramisu.  I decided that night I would go back the next day and if they had it still I would buy it.    I returned the next day with my husband and told the gentleman that I was back for the tiramisu and chuckled. He couldn't find a box for it so they used plastic wrap all around it.. when he rung me, he rung me up for 39.99. I stopped and looked at him surprised and said that is not the price both the gentleman told me the previous day. So the man at the front went to the back to get the man that told me the price and right off the bat before I even said anything he was yelling and telling me that I was wrong and what the price is. ( mind you I was being very polite ,not arguing with them, no attitude, just letting them know what they told me the previous day)  just rude in my book.   Bottom line Romanelli's fix your damn phone line so I can call instead of wasting my time two days on a row at your store! And don't yell at people when I literally did nothing to deserve it.

Unless you stop in at Romanelli's, this Delicatessen is the real deal.  I have stopped by Romanelli's a few times for lunch and I have never been disappointed. The aroma when I entered always brings back memories of back home. They even have small market, with hard to find delicacies.  Romanelli's has so many good things, sausages, meats, cheeses, sandwiches, pastries, cookies, cakes,  pasta, and meatballs,  just to name a few. If you're ever in the store you have to try Romanelli's bottled Marinara Sauce, it's absolutely delicious. It's the only bottled sauce you wont have to doctor up, its perfect right out of the jar.   Romanelli's offers a hot and cold lunch counter with daily specials like chicken parmesan, sausage & pepper sandwiches, Itaian beef sandwich and so much more. My favorite is the Italian Stallion, loaded with imported meats, cheeses, and Italian dressing, the perfect sandwich and it's big enough for two.   You can  'eat in' at small tables next to deli counter or get a great pinic lunch to go. The staff is wonderful at this family-owned restaurant, the prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious. If you're ever in the neighborhood you have to stop by you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "One of the best Italian delis around, not just in Phoenix, but ever! Fresh rolls with endless combinations of deli meats and cheeses. They have a sandwich menu, but you can pretty much get anything you want from their case of Boar's Head meats and cheese and hot food selections.   Some of my favorites are the Italian Stallion, meatball, and Robert's Special. But lately, Robert's Special has had my heart, perfect combo of roast beef and pastrami, swiss, mayo, tomato, and onions toasted to perfection. It's gotten to the point that when Robert sees me walk up to the counter he already knows I want his namesake sandwich. All the sandwiches are HUUGE and only $10 with chips and a drink.   Romanelli's is a family run place and in addition to an amazing deli, they're also a small Italian market with everything from homemade cannolis to frozen raviolis to ten different type of canned olives. You can also order hot food from the deli to go and/or cater food. All the staff are amazing and super friendly and you feel like you're apart of the fam (or maybe I just go too much?). And like any good catholic, they're closed on Sundays.",

Too far from our house to go often, but in the area would definitely stop and maybe try a sandwich, they did look good.

We decided to try out their subs for dinner. Their Italian bread subs were much larger than I expected. They toast it beautifully before stuffing them with meats and cheeses. You have the option of wheat and white breads as well. I decided on Italian as per recommendation of the proprietors.  The meatball sub was my favorite. The meatballs were large and juicy, smothered with cheesy goodness on crunchy toasted bread.  The Italian Stallion is lovely if you like cold cuts. It came with a variety of rich Italian meats. I am afraid I cannot name them. I would love to taste them individually the next time, but I admit that I wolfed my portion down.  The chicken Parmigiana sub was okay. I admit that I am a sucker for the freshly battered and fried then smothered sandwich. This one was not. It was a cooked breast with tomato sauce and cheese cooked concoction.  The baked ziti was rich and cheesy as well. It almost looked like lasagna. It came with a nice piece of garlic bread.  Finally, the cannoli was crispy and filled with a light, creamy filling with a hint of cinnamon and vanilla. Delicious! It was a delightful meal that fed 5 people for $42.",

I thought the prices for their grocery items were on the high side. I'm new to Phoenix so perhaps this is because Italian items are harder to come by than on the East coast? Just a guess. We were really disappointed in the cookies. They looked great! We picked out just under a dozen different varieties and they all tasted the same: stale. I don't know if they were baked too long ago or if had soaked up the smells of various sandwich meats, but they all tasted like they had been in a fridge with other foods for quite a while. They were expensive, too. The last disappointment was that we realized that they had charged us a service fee (without telling us) for using our credit card. And since we bought the cookies separately (after our meal) we got charged this fee twice.",

Aisles and aisles of canned, jarred, boxed and bagged Italian pantry essentials (and they're not covered in dust like some other places).   Keep an eye on the prices.

I really thought I could not find any authentic Italian anything anywhere in Arizona and I was really disappointed. Then I heard about this lovely place. They make REAL meatballs and REAL sauce. Buy the jarred sauce and buy the meatballs. You won't be disappointed.  The sauce tastes like my grandma's sauce, and that's saying a lot. The cannolis are also excellent. They use the REAL ricotta cheese that you can only find back east - Polly-O brand Ricotta Cheese. I asked the owner about it and she said they have the cheese special-ordered and shipped out so they can make the cannolis right. And I'm SO glad they do! This store has a lot of specialty Italian items that you can't find anywhere else, except maybe in Italy.   You can also order from the deli area and they have a great selection of hot and cold items and some table and chairs where you can get a quick bite.

The past half a dozen times I've been there, I was treated pleasantly once.  My daughter enjoys the chicken parm & my dad occasionally asks for the cannoli or I would not shop here. They're on my way home from work, otherwise I drive out of my way to get to them. Not worth it to me. My daughter and my dad don't have to deal with these rude, rude people. When you walk in the door, in addition to a buzzer, they have a mechanical voice that says \"front door\". I walk in and say a cheery good morning. They grunt to themselves and go back to their work. The attitude just gets worse as you're shopping and checking out.",

I went in this morning looking to get some pastries and cookies for my morning JOE.  Well bought Napoleon, Cannoli's , Biscotti, and Sesame cookies.   The Napoleon must have been in the case for about a week (custard was all skinned over and like strings), Cannoli was horrible filling not very sweet and not very creamy, the shell was crispy, biscotti had no flavor and was like cardboard.  Sesame cookies were good, like old NY.   Not sure if I will ever go back. Still have bad after taste of stale Napoleon and Cannoli.  :O(",

There was a good amount of meat on the sandwich, but I asked for everything except onions, but somehow didnt get any oil and vinegar so my sandwich was super dry,   The wheat bread was not very good, and too thick.   Overall, I was not impressed and regret going. I will stick to duck and decanter and jersey mike's subs from now on.",

Had the newyorker sandwich which is a double stuffed pastrami sandwich and the the robert special which was pastrami,provolone cheese,  roast beef, mayo and other things i forgot, it was $10.99 for the newyorker but they are so big i only ate half! (so half for lunch tomorrow and when you think subway sells a shit sandwich for around $8 it doesnt even compare). De falcos is a similar concept in scottsdale which is good but this place is way better. They have a full market of imported italian products and a pastry stand too selling fresh italian pastries cookies and bread. I had a homemade cannolis and italian and it was delicious not too sweet. There was a super cute Italian man handing out samples of his hand made italian sausage which they also sell there. 100% will not be just driving past anymore!",

An anomaly I am sure. Needless to say we were shocked. We had ordered out and didn't have time to return the sub, unfortunately, but I think it is safe to say we won't be returning.",

This place has the small town corner store feel with the great variety and high quality products that you expect to find in big box stores. If the food and ambiance doesn't get you, the super friendly staff will. These guys know their stuff, can hold a conversation and seem to really enjoy their jobs and helping customers.

I ended up getting a sub( the godfather), with all the fixings. It was perfect! We also purchased stuffed chicken ( stuffed with cheeses, tomatoes, peppers and prosciutto ). I felt like I was eating my grandmas stuffed chicken! DELICIOUS!   I was thrilled to find Ferrara torrone ( Italian almond & honey nougat candy) that my Grandma used to buy all the time when I was little.  Over all the food was delicious, however the prices were a bit much. I did purchase an over price keychain ( couldn't be worth more that $1, I paid 9.99), as well as a lanyard. Our total came to  a little under $50!   I will be returning before I move back east!",

When you first walk in you have to stop by their shirt display and second the cookies that you can purchase by the pound. The people there make you feel like you have been here many times and make you feed right at home. On the way out you must try the baked goods and especially their canoli's or whatever your eyes direct you to. Look around the store and listen to the background music.

It is a good thing that it is about 40 minutes from my house, otherwise I would most likely be there a few times a week! My husband and I were running an errand on the west side of town and were craving sandwiches. I quickly pulled out my Yelp app and 2 options came up within a few block radius - 1) Blimpie and 2) Romanelli's - ummmmmm, local love all day baby! Naturally, we went with Romanelli's and are SO glad that we did.   I ordered their Italian sandwich on white bread with all of the fixins and it was so dang good! The bread was soft and perfect and you could tell the meats were HIGH quality! Romanelli's is also an Italian grocer so we picked up some delicious pickled goods and freshly baked Italian pastries that were to die for. We'll absolutely be back when in the area and will most likely find ourselves making the 40 minute drive just to get it! Do yourself a favor and stop in for a delicious meal at this lovely family-owned and operated establishment.",

I'm pretty plain Jane as far as turkey and cheese but the dressing and the bread are key (and they have boars so the cold cuts are top notch) and neither disappointed. Picked up a jar our their own brand of marinara and very excited to try it. Will be back soon!",

The man behind the counter was so helpful as I sampled several different salads, honestly I wanted to take all of them home! Dont even get me started on the deserts, I took home cannoli, baklava and tiramisu!! The thing that gave this place 5 stars was the customer service.

To my horror, she blow her nose & expel mucus in front of me & did not bother to wash her hands.  I really wanted to taste the cannoli & when i saw her wear disposable gloves to serve another customer, i bought one choc cannoli. But i noticed she removed already her gloves & did short cut & pick up my cannoli with her bare hands. I dont wanna make a scene so i just pay & left & throw the cannoli in the garbage outside. I work in a food service industry & my point of writing this review is any person in the food service should practice good hygiene whether or not you are the owner or employee.

I've been to Romanelli's earlier this year, on March 19 - the feast of St. Joseph, to see if they sold those wonderful special filled zeppoles named after the saint and sold in Italian bakeries and food stores on his feast day. They did, and the pastries were delicious. I also browsed the packaged and canned goods areas and found lots of high quality Italian foods not normally found in supermarkets and regular food stores.   But it was today after reading the reviews here that I decided to try the deli. I ordered the Italian Stallion sub and it was really, really good! The meats were very high quality, fresh and ample, and there was just enough lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, and dressing to enhance the flavors without competing with the deli meats. It's so good to know that there is a great deli place not far from where I live, and where I can treat myself to or bring visiting friends for a great New York style deli experience.",

    "text": "Gruff italian deli/bakery/market/bodega extraordinaire. Had heard of it's reputation via Yelp and swung in when I passed it on Dunlap. To be honest, I just went for the cannoli. Staff suggested the baked ziti or the chicken parmesan, but they were out of both (granted, it was ten minutes til close).   Deli looked well stocked and downright delicious, but my eyes were on the prize... they filled 6 cannoli as I wandered the aisles, checking out their pasta selection (actually not too impressive). I asked for a bag of ice to keep them cool as I live an hour away and the kid brought a ten-pound bag of ice, the kind you buy for your beer cooler.   The manager said, \"Did you charge her for that?\" Well, I didn't actually need a BAG of ICE, I wanted the cannoli to keep cool. Offered up my credit card as a peace offering and he shook his head, kinda disgusted and shooed me out with a \"just take it and go.\" I felt guilty, but hey, if you don't get my drift and charge me $2.00 for a bag of beverage ice then expect cash... I brought in $2 in change that I scrounged for in my car and he seemed surprised.  Cannoli were good, authentic, but the shell was a little thick for my taste. If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll stop by again, perhaps hit up the deli. Word of advice: spell out what you want and maybe you'll get it, maybe you won't. And maybe you'll have to pay extra :)",

    "text": "Originally I never even heard of this place. It was like a hidden gem. My Italian coworker told me about it when I told him I had trouble finding a place that can make a good cannoli. (I can make them myself but I don't want to).   We got our sandwiches to go. The sandwiches were super good. They had great quality ingredients. I would definitely return again. The only thing I didn't like about this place is the location. It seems kinda scary if I were to go alone at night. However, they close at 6pm. But inside, it's very cute. They have a bunch of stuff for sale like little signs, a great olive oil selection, a bunch of baked goods, and other imported awesomeness. If I had more money I probably would have spent like $100 on a few olive oils in there.   The workers were efficient and very nice. It was a very pleasant experience.   But back to the sandwiches: the bread was fresh and had great flavor. I'm super picky on bread. I think if a place has terrible bread, everything else can only be mediocre at best. It had a great texture, wasn't overly dense or too chewy. We wanted to try a few different sandwiches. We had the 19, which is Robert's special (our new favorite)-$7.99. It had roast beef, pastrami, provolone, tomato, mayo & onion. It was everything you want a hot sandwich to taste like that didn't have anything fried on it. I was glad they didn't put too much mayo on it. I'm generally not a fan of mayo. But all the flavors worked well together. I'd be back just based on that sandwich alone. We also tried 15, their super sub with ham, capicolla, pepperoni & I don't remember what kind of cheese-$7.99. It was good though. That one wasn't anything spectacular, but we were definitely not disappointed. We got 7, the \"Italian stallion\" house sub.-$6.99. It had ham, capicolla, genoa salami, pepperoni & provolone. I liked this one a lot too. It had a great combination of flavors. I would recommend this one as well. The last sandwich we brought home was 18, George's special-$7.99. It had ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella (a pink Italian sausage made of finely ground pork, & smooth textured) , pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers. They asked if we wanted mild or hot peppers. We of course, wanted hot peppers. I feel like I'm repeating myself, but it also was pretty awesome. Everything worked well together in the sandwich. I loved the slight crunch from the hot peppers as well as that extra \"zing\" it adds.   And the whole reason that we went there, the cannoli-$2.99. I only bought one and I wish I bought more. I'm kind of glad I didn't though because I probably could have eaten a bunch. It had a good texture for the cannoli shell. It wasn't soggy or rock hard. The filling was great. It wasn't overly sweet. It didn't have raisins, so I was really glad about that. It probably could have used a little bit more mascarpone in the filling, but it was still extremely delicious and a really great treat. I will buy more of these when I'm back too. I can't wait to try the other yummy looking treats as well.",

In the last few minutes of enjoying the A/C in my car, I looked around at the writing all over the windows of Romanelli's and saw the entrance to the right and exit to the left... I was instantly taken back to my summer backpacking in Italy.  If you have ever visited Italy, and you never had to visit the supermercato while you were there, then you have no idea what I'm talking about, but for those of you that have been broke and backpacking, you know what I mean when I say this place has the same set up as an authentic Italian market-- a designated entrance, and very far away, usually after walking through the entire store, a designated exit.  And don't you dare go in through the exit... I don't know why, but it is heavily frowned upon.  Anyway, the only reason I came here was because I had a cannoli craving.  I picked up a Rockstar and two cannoli (one for me, one for my grandma), for about $10- kinda pricey, but it was worth it.  Best. Cannoli. In Phoenix.  If you had to make me choose, I'd go the Godfather route... take the cannoli, leave the gun..",

    "text": "I have been coming here off and on for years and usually get treated okay,  but today it was different. I go in after having a stressful day at work all morning and day to get there by 3:15pm to purchase and eat my first meal of the day to have this what I feel was a ignorant,  prejudice, hateful old  man with glasses on was making my sandwich and he kept abruptly, rudely dismissing me and what I was saying I wanted on my sandwich and I found that to be embarrassing and rude. The people standing around me were uncomfortable with the whole approach as well,  so I calmly stood there thinking to myself, I deserve better treatment than what I am receiving and I feel that I am not being treated as the loyal valued customer as I should be. So then another worker that usually is there most of the time when I have ordered my food comes walking up and so I was assured everything was going to be okay by this point after my salutation to him and he dismissed and ignored me as well in front of all the customers that were standing around me and started taking their orders as he antagonized me in the process in how his coworker was mistreating me. I took it as if he thought it was funny to play with my fuckin food.  Well now you know Romanellis that I do do not play when it comes to fair, good, and acceptable treatment to a customer that has done nothing but up sale your company with compliments and how good your food is.  The arrogance that I have been receiving lately when coming in there has made me feel uncomfortable and now my blood pressure is high because my food was not satisfied and this is why I walked out on you after seeing the condescending prick was getting negative attitudes with me when in fact now I will and now have an attitude with Romanellis and the entire environment and staff. I am already spreading the word by mouth how you guys treated me today and will never come in there again and I have let three people know already and they said they will not go in there anymore.  Learn how to treat people especially the loyal customers that has done nothing but show you loyalty and love.  I can't stand this fuckin place now.  That was and is the last button of mine to push. I will not allow anyone or an arrogant business, person, or group ever mistreat and make me feel unworthy again. No more Romanellis for me, oh I forget thats what they wanted in the first place in mistreating me. So no loss right??  What a fuckin joke.",

Every now and then, my family gets the craving for authentic Italian subs, and Romanelli's is always the first place that comes to mind. You can get far more than just subs, however. You can purchase deli meat and hot meals (pasta, chicken parmesan, eggplant Parmesan...) at the back counter, and towards the front there are sweets galore. We're talking New York cheesecake, cannolis, macaroons, and much more.   As for the rest of the place? It's built like a small grocery store but filled with imported Italian foods. Everything from pizza dough, pasta (frozen or dry), sauce, condiments...It's all here and it's all authentic.   My dad has made friends with a few of the workers, but especially Robert the owner. He is extremely helpful and goes above and beyond. It's not uncommon that we get a TON of food from Romanelli's to satiate a party we are having at the house, and each time the order has been 100% perfect. Our guests consistently comment on how good the food is!",

    "text": "I love trying italian delis and I felt like this one fell short. I'm not sure if it was just an off day for them or what but I had very weird off putting vibe from them. I went out of my way to try them on a Friday for the very first time. Seats were about 3/4 full with one giant party. Not a single worker or customer looked like they were in a good mood. Nobody laughed or was smiling the whole 30 mins or so I was there. It was odd. The mood was so depressing I actually felt quite uncomfortable eating there. The workers were not particularly friendly and none greeted me either. I have visited Andreolis Italian grocers and cheese n stuff which were my favorite Italian grocers. Andreolis has great Italian meals with homemade pasta and their bread is all made in house and so good. And the workers there all love to chat and are super friendly and authentically Italian. Most Italian spots I've hit love having convos with their guests and are generally in an upbeat mood. Lots of owners have personally approached me to introduce themselves. This was not the case at romanellis. Just a complete night and day difference from the workers at romanellis. Cheese n stuff has some of the best Italian sandwhiches in phoenix even tho it's a hole in the wall. Their hot sandwiches are not super sloppy and wet and watery but are full of flavor and not too salty. I just expected more out of romanellis after experiencing some other Italian Delis that have made me proud. I feel like I deserve better at romanellis. I hope workers were just tired that day.   The food was sloppy and too salty. I ordered a hot beef sub which looked great upon order. But I took one bite and juice just splattered everywhere. The bread was super toasted but upon the burst of juice immediately became a soggy mess. The bread fell apart on both sides. I had to pick up soggy bread with my fingers and pinch together meat to eat with it. I wanted to take a picture but both my hands were so greasy. I hope this was just an off day. The sandwich did have good flavor and I would eat it again but it was just too wet to be eaten as a sandwhich. I don't know if the guy forgot to drain the beef that day or what. I hear good things about this place tho so I will give them another shot. Maybe I will try a dry cold cut next time as many pix that said positive reviews were of their cold sandwhiches. I would not get the hot Italian beef sandwhich again.",

They have fresh sausages, hot and cold dishes, lots of grocery items, and so much more.

Sevice (at the bakery counter, and checkout) was great, and if the treats taste as good as always, 5 stars for sure.  However, common sense for packaging the goodies gets 2 Stars. :-? As you can see from the picture, the guy put 1 Eclair on its side (luckily, the scrumptiouselious chocolate topping didn't peel off, too badly). But, the Chocolate Canolli lost a bit of filling because it was put in sideways, and scrapped the inside of the box. Sheesh.  Later tonight, I'll edit the review, after I eat the Canolli and an Eclair.  EDIT: Well, after the most awesome and fantastic dinner, I was only able to enjoy the Canolli, and half an Eclair (that leaves 1.5 Eclairs for tomorrow). But, they were as good as ever.  The only way the Chocolate Canolli could be made better, is to add Chocolate Chips to the filling (hint-hint, guys).  For the Eclair, I don't see how it can be improved. There have been a couple of incidents where the filling was missing from the middle 3rd of the Eclair was missing. But, that didn't happen today.  Had the goodies been packaged better, I would have given 'em 5 Stars.",

We ordered sandwiches to go (their famous Italian Sub) and that seems to be a popular menu item, three other people in line ordered the same sandwich. It was large and very good! I noticed they have Italian beef and pizza options also, will have to come back and try more goodies! They have a good selection of desserts and hot items as well that you can grab to go. Good seating area, if you want to stay in and eat there. The owner was very nice and invited us to come back.",

    "text": "Amazing meatballs and the bread. W. T. u know..... AND THEN....  Ok I need to focus.   I am torn to call this da best cause I frequent Delfalcos in Scottsdale BUT it I 1a for sure. The meatball is tender and melty with the good cheese on to then a nice spiceon too. But the bread is the star. I have never been so excited to eat bread, who would be , but I could eat this plain. Perfect toast that held the Sammie together despite the sw-auce all over the place. I am typing with one hand cause I can't put the Sammie down.  The pasta salad was fresh and tasty. They didn't put tomatos in it as much as WHOLE cherry tomatoes in it ! It was a salad with asparagus as well so I tried cuase I've never even heard about this style of salad. This thing is full of stuff and nothing is overpowering at all.   THEN THIS HAPPENED.... I could only assume the owner walks around with wax paper in his hand with his homemade sausage. Totally flavorful with a legit spice at the end. Wow. Dude jus walk-in around blowing peoples minds with his sausage(that's funny on a lot of levels)   THE ONLY FAULT I CAN FIND.... I don't live close. I would be diabetic if I did. I'm coming back and will report more cause ima try EVERYTHING.  Did I mention they sell homemade cookies by the lbs? AMAZING AND AND AND.... a full Italian grocery  Update: it's less than two days later and I'm already back. Had the sausage and peppers with sauce and cheese. BETTA THAN DA MEATBALL!!!",

I came with my wife for lunch, and we crushed our sandwiches, San Pellegrino's, and then walked around. I saw that they had guanciale - hard to find usually at most stores - and I got some. The gentleman packed it up, priced it, gave me a few more slices on top of that, \"That's for the baby boy ... \" He had seen my wife was pregnant. What a sweetheart.   Hours later, I realized I had dropped my wallet. Checked everywhere. Finally, called Romanelli's. They had found it outside. One of the staff met me in Central Phoenix to deliver it to me.   This is a class act, with staff members that are princes amongst men.",

    "text": "I came here because a friend from Chicago said I had to try an Italian Beef Sandwich which is comprised of seasoned beef on a long Italian-style roll, soaked in au jus with giardiniera (Italian relish of pickled vegetables in vinegar or oil). So I looked for an Italian Deli on this side of town.  For some reason I just did not like it, I wish there was more giardiniera because all I could taste was the roast beef with the roll. Maybe I should go to a Chicago place that specializes in these types of sandwiches instead, or perhaps they are just not for me.  Next, I tried their baked goods. A peanut butter cookie, a lemon cookie, a chocolate cookie, a rasberry cookie, a sugar cookie dipped in chocolate and sprinkles, and a coconut cookie. The only cookie I liked was the coconut cookie. I ended up ordering 3 more! The rest simply tasted like shortbread cookies with mild flavoring, the flavors were far too subtle. Some almost tasted the same.  Overall everything was just okay, but the coconut cookies are worth a visit. The staff was friendly and helpful and the bathroom and store was clean.",

You can dine in or place an order to go. They also have a large deli selection, pizza and pasta dishes to go. They have a large Italian  grocery section and desserts.

He sent me straight to Romanelli's, and I've been going there every winter ever since. I've even thrown spaghetti dinners for my East Coast friends and relatives in Phoenix and all ingredients are from Romanelli's. Their meatballs are divine. I will never make another meatball from scratch again. Their red gravies are also delicious, and so are the breads and cannolis (this coming from someone who visits Little Italy in NYC like its Mecca), so when I'm in Phoenix, I go straight to Romanelli's instead of making it myself from scratch. Sorry Mom!",

ALL Italian food, fresh made pasta.  And the family there that run the place are awesome!  It's been a while since I've been there but Robert is so helpful.  And they recognize my mom!!!  (After spending a couple hunge.)  Their cannolis and Italian Cassata cake is amazing, as are the rest!!!  If they would make homemade arancinis and fresh calzones they would get 6 stars from me!!!

It was crusty, but not so hard that you could bite into it.  We split a cannoli for dessert. Crunchy and sweet.   I would highly recommend Romanelli's. Worth the trip.  N*joy...",

It is located down the street from the high school that I went to and we used to stop most days for some cheese pizza or \"Italian Stallion\" sandwich. Now that I have grown this is a prime place to shop for my own culinary needs such as pastas, cold cuts, pizza toppings, sauces and even hommade pizza dough just waiting to be thawed and used to make your own delicious pizzas.  I still stop in for the occassional sandwish and the \"Italian Stallion\" is still my top choice. Ham, capicolla,  grnoa salami, pepperoni and provalone cheese piles high with onions thinnly shredded lettuce tomatoes and of course bread soggy with dressing as it should be. And don't forget to follow it up with your favorite italian sweet. I haven't had a bad dessert yet.  The service is prompt and charmingly brusque. A real New York feeling here.

Mostly, it's a rather expansive Italian market. Need olive oil? They have 20+ different kinds. Pasta? There's a whole aisle. How about one of those wooden thingies for making gnocchi. Got that too.  In the back, a counter runs along the whole length of the back wall. That's where you'll find all sorts of cheeses, cold cuts, and sausauge, plus a few sweets.   It's also where you order sandwiches. And you'd better know exactly what your want, and fast. The man behind the counter is perpetually surly and curt. It gets worse if you stand there and try to make heads or tails of all the hand-written sandwich combinations taped to the wall. Luckily, the woman who runs the cash register is always very sweet. So that kind of makes up for it.  I want to love their sandwiches. I just don't. They're OK. The meat is always really good, there just isn't enough of it. Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things.   Until then, I'll continue to support Romanelli's, but they'll only get a so-so rating for the deli. The product selection, however, is top notch.",

    "text": "If you want authentic Italian meats and cheeses in the Valley of the Sun, Romanellis should be your stop.  From the outside, it looks like your basic store in a strip mall, but you walk in and you can see immediately that these people are not fooling around.  Besides the various Italian Pride type of shirts and other tchotchkes, there are aisles of various foods either made at the deli, or shipped in from elsewhere.  Do you need olive oil or pasta? They have plenty of those along with sauces and preserved veggies.  The real draw though is the deli.  Skip the Boars Head branded meats and sandwiches made with them because you can get that anywhere, you want to go for the real meats and cheeses, which are further to the left.  Since there are multiple brands of some items, do not be afraid to ask the person behind the counter which ones are the best.  Highly recommended are the pastrami, hot cappicola, and genoa salami.  Their signature sandwich seems to be the Italian Stallion, which is very very good, but there are are a wide variety of sandwiches that you can pick up.  Besides that they also offer plenty of pasta salad and antipasto to take home, and on the day I went, you could pick up sausage and peppers for your lunch.  The staff itself come from areas like NYC and New Jersey so don't be entirely surprised if they keep things short and sweet, it's nothing personal against you.    There's also a bakery case with various desserts, go for the sfogliatelle and cannoli, they are excellent.",

The two stars is for the fact that they appear to pass off fake Parmigiano-Reggiano as the real thing (check the rinds -- if there isn't an imprint, it's not legit). And at around $18/pound, that's a shady thing to do. They also sell Garofalo pasta for $5/pound, which you can buy at Costco for $12 -- and for that price you get 8 pounds. Also: skip the cannoli. They taste like they just added a little vanilla to a can of Betty Crocker frosting for the filling.  But they do have several good olive oils that aren't absurdly marked up, as well as my favorite, La Valle San Marzano canned tomatoes which are only a buck or two more than you can find elsewhere. They also sell Maestri Pastai (a very good pasta), but at AJ's prices (although to be fair, Romanelli's and AJ's are the only two stores in the city who sell the brand).  So, go in for a sandwich, but I can't recommend much else other than the aforementioned few items.",

While trying to figure out what we wanted, the guy behind the counter started telling us about some of the hot entrees they had in addition to the sandwiches.  Italian sausage with onions and peppers, lasagna, veal parm and something else.  He gave us samples of the sausage.  OMG!  Incredible flavor.  He definitely was making our decision harder.  Chose George's special and we decided to get some fresh hot italian sausage from the meat counter along with some fresh parm to take home for dinner.    We, like another reviewer were supposed to be coming here for a sandwich and we walked out with so much more.  I love to cook so we walked out with pasta, the fresh sausage, hunk of parm, fresh garlic bread, black and white cookie (huge and yummy), a fabulously thick and robust tomato sauce with onion and peppers.  Think the baked ziti I made with these ingredients was the best by far.  When making italian, no more grocery items, coming here instead.  If you're looking for a great italian deli/grocer, etc, you gotta try this place.",

It wasn't until reading reviews online that I decided I have to give this place a shot. As a foodie, I can't believe I haven't discovered this place earlier! They have imported cheeses, meats, italian desserts, san marzano tomatoes, and they make sandwiches too! The sandwiches are good, but I think the bread is too big and tough to eat- but at least it won't get soggy easily. My boyfriend specially requested a salami and turkey sandwich and they rang us at no extra cost like Subway does. Considering this is a specialty food store, the prices are comparable to a regular grocery store PLUS it's a family owned local place. Can't beat that!",

I am a sucker for italian subs, but picky when it comes to the quality. This was perfect. I will definitely be going there myself to see what their other dishes tastes like.",

Everyone is friendly.  We got greeted when we walked in with a \"good morning ladies\" and \"what can I get for you today\" as we approached the deli. We ended up doing a little grocery shopping (they have specialty groceries) . Ended up sharing a sub and trying a few of the pasta sides. Deli was clean, everyone wore gloves and were understanding when it took some time for the kids to decide what they wanted. That's a big deal to me.  My girls wanted cookies (5 and 7 years old)  We started off with a few selections and ended up with a box... ;0 ... lady behind the counter was so patient with them when they asked what was in the cookies about a hundred times. On the way out we ended up with cannoli's as well.  Really nice feel to the place. I would definitely recommend.",

I am still on the hung for the amazing bread I miss so much when I lived in Santa Monica at \"Bay Cities Italian Deli\".  I was hopeful for Romanelli's after reading the reviews, but not even close.  \"Ike's For Love Of Sanwiches\" is pretty good, but still not the same as \"Bay Cities\" in Santa Monica.  If anyone knows of a deli with amazing rolls, please let me know!  Romanelli's has good meat and also \"Parma\" prosciutto, which can be hard to find in many delis.  They have a good selection of meats, cheeses, salads, and hot items.  They have both cold & hot subs available for purchase at pretty good prices.  My sub was $7 and it was huge; like 14\".  It fed me twice, and was even better after it sat and soaked up all the flavors for 2 or 3 hours.  Check it out if your in the area and are in the mood for a solid sub!",

At least let me pretend it seems fresher and hide it behind the counter. They have a lot stuff in the shelves but i never see to much go out the door. The cannoli and other pasty in the case have always satisfied but no chocolate dipped cannoli when i really wanted one. Had to do with a standard one but they always please either way. With a few dollars and an overhaul they could make some more $$. But is kinda grubby and the staff is okay.  Try to get the soda in my cup and less than 3/4 icet. Parking is terrible. Do yourself a favor get yourself a cold sub to go and skip the ambience.",

They have unique olive oils and balsamic vinegar, frozen and fresh pasta/sauce, and a deep selection of other Italian foods.  I stopped in for lunch.  The small dining area was pretty full of business men and women, along with some regulars, including an exceptionally sweet woman who shared with me her love of a daily Italian Beef sandwich and Mass.  Her sandwich, and fresh lobster salad on the side, looked delicious.   I had a hot pastrami on rye with cole slaw, Boar's Head cheese, and dressing.  It was very good.  I would definitely go back --- hopefully with cooler for groceries next time -- and recommend it as a solid lunch place if you in the area.",

    "text": "Romanelli's Deli and Bakery, if that doesn't sound Italian nothing does.  I was heading north on 35th Ave and passed Dunlap on my way to give Rocket subs another try.  Out of the corner of my eye I glimpsed the sign for Romanelli's and immediately flipped a u-turn, left a little Z rubber on the pavement and scooted back to Romanelli's.  It's located on the south side of Dunlap, just east of 35th avenue in a small non-descript strip mall but the sign is large and you really can't miss it.  You enter one door on the west and exit a little ways east by the cash register.  This is a great little Italian grocery/deli/bakery.  If Italian is what you're looking for, there's a good chance it's here.  Cases of San Marazano tomatoes, pastas, sauces, exotic olive oils, etc.  I wanted lunch and had heard great things about their sandwiches.  All True.  I had the 10\" supersub with  1/2 lb of meat (ham, capicolla, pepperoni, and cheese along with red onions, lettuce and tomato).  Choice of bread is white, wheat, Italian.  The Italian bread has a harder crust than the white so I opted for the white; I tend to like softer food.  I also grabbed a cane sugar cherry soda from the case.  The sandwich was excellent, very good, bread was spot on and the meat was tasty and sliced fresh.  I stayed and ate onsite; they have a number of tables to sit at.  I was charged an extra $1 for the soda because I was eating onsite, not sure why, kind of struck me as odd.  Finished the meal with a handmade chocolate cannolli which almost caused an accident from my eyes rolling back into my head while I was driving, it was so good!  I had hoped to eat half and save half for later today but it didn't even make it to two blocks to I-17.  Between the cannolli and the cane sugar soda I'm in no danger of low blood sugar tonight.  This is a family operation and they were all exceedingly helpful and polite, it was a refreshing change from the \"chain\" mentality.    I'll be back!",

The sub was made with the highest quality & freshest cuts of meat and produce.  No more Jersey Mike's or Subway, etc...for me.  The bakery counter was filled with fresh made cookies, cakes, sweets, etc.  The deli counter was filled with homemade salads, dishes and deli meats and cheeses.  Will definitely make this stop more often, especially since they have so many Italian ingredients/groceries.",

Regardless, I will be back because they have great quality products.",

We ordered lasagna, and 3 subs to go, along with some sfogatelle pastries.  Although I wish they had offered to warm up the pastry, I enjoyed the lemon flavored custard filled triangle (you find pastries next to the cash register, made fresh!). The lasagna and hot subs tasted amazing--the Italian bread is fresh and baked just right. I wasn't a big fan of the cold subs we got, but it's just a preference.  Another tip: the subs are a foot long, for about $8 to $10. We thought they were personal sandwhiches, and got more than our own fill.",

I ordered the 10\" sub sandwich on white bread.  The bread was great, soft but substantial with great flavor.  The meats were quality and the provolone had great bite.  Seems hard to find a good flavorful provolone anymore, theirs was great and a nice thick slice.  They added a good balance of oil/vinegar, tomato, red onion, lettuce and oregano.  Great sandwich!  I couldn't get out if there without ordering a canoli.  I ordered the regular.  At $2.99, they aren't cheap but worth it.  The filling is made with a hefty dose of vanilla, which I love.  Just the right amount of chocolate chips.  The shell was crispy but not too thick and I could really taste the cinnamon.    All in all, like the previous reviewer....\"this place is legit\".  I will be back for sure!",

We found it at Romanelli's !! All I can say is YUM YUM !! The Meatball subs and the Capicola Subs are soooo good!!! The homemade rolls are the best !!! We are going to try everything on the Menu , I hear that the Pastrami is really really good, but, when  we get there  we need the Meatball and Capicola , so my husband I split one of each and take home what we can not finish. We never leave there without buying some of their homemade Italian sausage to cook with my sauce I make at home, it is the best sausage you will find , very very good! I am italian and know what is authentic and this is it!!! My husband agrees it is worth the 35 mile drive each way for us to go have some great food!! Plus the bakery has the most delicious cookies and cannoli ! Not to mention the freezer has Spumoni! We love the Market too, we can get all our imported items needed for cooking at home Pasta etc. We highly recommend Romanelli's!!  Sam the owner and  the nice woman we met at the cash register and forgot to get her name ( darn next time) and everyone that works there make you feel at home!!!.......Thank You ,Michelle and Dave",

    "text": "If I were Italian I think I would come here every day.  Better yet I'd pitch a tent right in the middle of the store and live here.  What an amazing italian grocery/ deli/ bakery this place is for Phoenix.  I was hoping to come here just to try a sandwich and had to leave with a few other items.  I bought an antipasta salad for later and upon checking out there was this little old lady behind a dessert counter with chocolate cannoli's staring right at me.  Of course I couldn't resist!  The location isn't in the nicest area, but it's definitely worth hopping off I-17 to enjoy some Italian scenery and food.  The staff took me back to the time when I was in NYC walking in Little Italy during the San Gennaro festival.   That's culture at its greatest, but this was somewhat similar in many ways.",

Shared some cannolis etc. and the Napolean Piece. Sweetness was perfect. Did not feel sooo rich that we were bloated. Just the perfect flavor and perfect amount of richness. Love the atmosphere.... Loved the store.",

    "text": "I would have to compare this place to Lucca's Deli in Castro Valley, CA.  The sandwiches are great here.  Once you step out of your car in the parking lot, you can smell the great food coming from their doors.   They are really quick to make your sandwich and take your order.  I went there just before the lunch rush, so I'm not sure how quick they are when it gets really busy.  The cashier up front was really nice and recommended we try their Canolis.  I'm glad we did because it was the perfect end to a great sandwich.",

    "text": "Is this the best Italian Deli / Bakery that I've ever been to? No. Is this the best one in the Valley area? Absofrigginlutely!!!   This is the ONLY place that I know of in this metro area that you can select from eight varieties/brands of San Marzano Tomatoes. If you have to ask why that is significant enough to merit 5 stars... then I can only imagine that you haven't spent decades attempting to perfect your Pomodoro or Pizza Sauce.   Combine this with the fact that they almost always have Rainbow cookies available and some of the best fresh Italian breads, and you have achieved two-thirds of an almost idyllic Italian meal.   Before you leave the store, make sure you take a leisurely stroll along the back wall. This is what I like to consider a little piece of heaven on earth. Every imaginable cheese / meat you've ever heard uttered by the Mario's, Lydia's, and Giada's of this world can be found in the case that runs the entire length of the store. Want to create an out of this world antipasto selection for your next get together? Seriously if you can't find it in that case, you are trying to live up to Captain Jack Harkness standards, and although I adore him... he is a work of fiction!   And I have to agree with Nathan; they make one hell of a sandwich, but I've never sampled any of their other eat in/take out items, so my input is limited on that side of the house.   This is not a \"pretty\" place. It's not trendy or new and it is located in yet another strip mall. But it is a fully functional, family run, local business that is operated by two of the nicest guys you would ever want to meet. As far as quality and friendliness goes, this place rocks! I discovered Romanelli's about 25 years ago (remember... it's not polite to ask a girl's age) and let's just say, they had me at ciao. : )",

I had the Italian stallion sub and artichoke salad, my buddy had the homemade sausage with peppers and we spilt some prosciutto stuffed peppers. Everything was incredible, fresh and authentic. Check them out. I would love to give a review on the cannoli but I'm taking it to go. They look great tho.",
